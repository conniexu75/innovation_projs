https://openalex.org/W1562110281,"Ligation of the multimeric T-cell antigen receptor complex (TCR) triggers a pleiotropic cellular activation response that includes lymphokine secretion, cell-cycle progression, and ultimately, T-cell proliferation. The earliest detectable biochemical event triggered by TCR cross-linkage is the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific intracellular proteins, which, in turn, propagate receptor-mediated signals into the cytoplasm and nucleus. In this study, we have examined the effects of pervanadate, a powerful inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), on the activation state of the human leukemic T-cell line, Jurkat. Treatment of Jurkat cells with pervanadate rapidly induced a series of proximal T-cell activation events that closely resembled those induced by TCR-dependent stimuli. Moreover, pervanadate treatment, like TCR cross-linkage, stimulated interleukin-2 production in wild-type Jurkat cells, indicating that the biochemical events initiated by this TCR-independent stimulus were sufficient to induce lymphokine gene expression. Exposure of intact cells to pervanadate also stimulated the in vitro catalytic activities of both p59fyn and p56lck, src family kinases strongly implicated in TCR-mediated signaling. The stimulatory effects of pervanadate on protein tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling events were accompanied by a marked inhibition of CD45-associated PTP activity. However, the ability of pervanadate to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation in CD45-negative Jurkat cells suggests that PTPs other than CD45 are important intracellular targets for pervanadate. These studies demonstrate that inhibition of PTP activities in Jurkat cells leads to a T-cell activation response that is remarkably similar to that induced by TCR crosslinkage."
https://openalex.org/W1568965788,"The beta gamma subunits of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) have been shown to activate unidentified phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes (Camps, M., Hou, C., Sidiropoulos, D., Stock, J. B., Jakobs, K. H., and Gierschik, P. (1992) Eur. J. Biochem. 206, 821-831; Blank, J. L., Brattain, K. A., and Exton, J. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23069-23075). To identify these target PLC isozymes, we measured the effect of bovine brain G protein beta gamma subunits on PLC-beta 1, PLC-beta 2, PLC-beta 3, PLC-gamma 1, and PLC-delta 1 activity by reconstituting purified protein components with lipid vesicles containing [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P2). A nearly saturating concentration of beta gamma produced 2.5-, 4-, 8.5-, and 2-fold increases in PLC-beta 1, PLC-beta 2, PLC-beta 3, and PLC-delta 1 activity, respectively, and no activation of PLC-gamma 1, in the presence of 0.2 microM free Ca2+. The beta gamma-dependent activation of the PLC-beta isozymes does not appear to be the result of increased affinity of the enzymes for Ca2+. The beta gamma-dependent PLC activation could be reversed by addition of the GDP-bound form of the alpha subunit of G(o). The alpha subunits of Gq class G proteins have been shown to activate PLC-beta isozymes in the order of PLC-beta 1 > or = PLC-beta 3 >> PLC-beta 2, which differs from the order of PLC-beta 3 > PLC-beta 2 > PLC-beta 1 for beta gamma-dependent activation. Furthermore, the half-maximal concentration of beta gamma (25 nM) required to activate PLC-beta 3 is much higher than that of Gq alpha subunits (0.6 nM) required to activate PLC-beta 1. These results suggest that the extracellular signals that induce the dissociation of G(o) or Gi, the heterotrimeric G proteins abundant in brain, should enhance the hydrolysis of PtdIns 4,5-P2 in brain primarily through activation of PLC-beta 3 (PLC-beta 2 is not detectable in brain). However, signals that activate the less abundant Gq class heterotrimers should result in the activation primarily of PLC-beta 1 and PLC-beta 3 by the corresponding alpha subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1537449868,"The bombesin (BN)-like peptides mediate a diverse spectrum of biological activities and have been implicated as autocrine growth factors in the pathogenesis and progression of some human small cell lung carcinoma tumors. Previously, two mammalian BN-like peptide receptor subtypes, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor and neuromedin-B receptor, have been cloned and characterized. In this study, we have isolated and characterized human genomic and complementary DNA (cDNA) clones encoding a new BN-like peptide receptor subtype, BN receptor subtype 3 (BRS-3). Expression of BRS-3 cDNA in Xenopus oocytes encodes a functional receptor that is specifically activated by BN-like peptides. Chromosome mapping studies indicate that the BRS-3 gene is located on human chromosome X. BRS-3 mRNA expression in rat tissues is limited to secondary spermatocytes in testis. In contrast, BRS-3 mRNA is widely expressed in a panel of human cell lines from all histological types of lung carcinoma. These results suggest a role for BN-like peptides and their receptors in mammalian reproductive physiology and also indicate that BRS-3 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for human lung carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W1548889676,"We have cloned the yeast PRE2 gene by complementation of pre2 mutants, which are defective in the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome (multicatalytic-multifunctional proteinase complex). The PRE2 gene, a beta-type member of the proteasomal gene family, is essential for life and codes for a 287-amino acid proteasomal subunit with a predicted molecular mass of 31.6 kDa. Missense mutations in two pre2 mutant alleles were identified. They led to enhanced sensitivity of yeast cells against stress. At the same time, pre2 mutants accumulated ubiquitinated proteins. The Pre2 protein shows striking homology to the human Ring10 protein (60% identity excluding the 70 amino-terminal residues), which is encoded in the major histocompatibility complex class II region. It represents a component of the low molecular mass polypeptide complex, previously shown to be a special type of the 20 S proteasome. The low molecular mass polypeptide complex is assumed to be involved in antigen presentation, generating peptides from cytosolic protein antigens, which are subsequently presented to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes on the cell surface. The high homology of Pre2 to Ring10 implies the hypothesis that Ring10 is a subunit of the low molecular mass polypeptide complex central in its chymotryptic activity. One might further suggest that replacement of constitutive proteasomal components by functionally related major histocompatibility complex-linked low molecular mass polypeptides, as is Ring10, adapts mammalian proteasomes for functions in the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2047649751,Rhabdomyosarcoma cells express the myogenic helix-loop-helix proteins of the MyoD family but do not differentiate into skeletal muscle cells. Gel shift and transient transfection assays revealed that MyoD in the rhabdomyosarcoma cells was capable of binding DNA but was relatively nonfunctional as a transcriptional activator. Heterokaryon formation with fibroblasts resulted in the restoration of transcriptional activation by MyoD and the differentiation of the rhabdomyosarcoma cells into skeletal muscle cells. These results suggest that rhabdomyosarcomas are deficient in a factor required for MyoD activity.
https://openalex.org/W1590540783,"Ca(2+)-stimulable (type I), Ca(2+)-insensitive (type II), and Ca(2+)-inhibitable adenylylcyclase (type VI) were transiently expressed in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) increased cAMP synthesis by the Ca(2+)-insensitive type II adenylylcyclase more than 9-fold within 10 min, while the treatment had no effect on the other two types of adenylylcyclases. This stimulatory effect of PDBu on type II activity was dose-dependent and synergistic with the effect of forskolin. Another phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), had a similar stimulatory effect on type II activity, while its inactive isomer, 4 alpha-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (4 alpha-PMA), had no effect. Staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, markedly attenuated the action of PDBu on cAMP synthesis by type II adenylylcyclase. These results are particularly significant in that they indicate that a species of adenylylcyclase that is insensitive to regulation by one arm of the phosphatidylinositide pathway, i.e. Ca2+, nevertheless can be regulated by the other arm, i.e. PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1657090468,"The pharmacological significance and structural basis of the gamma-aminobutyrate (GABAA) receptor heterogeneity was investigated in situ by an immunobiochemical analysis of receptor populations characterized by the delta- and alpha 5-subunit. Using an antiserum specific for the delta-subunit, a population of GABAA receptors (21 +/- 2% of solubilized receptors) was immunoprecipitated from rat brain extracts which contained high affinity benzodiazepine binding sites. They were distinguished from those immunoprecipitated by the alpha 1- and alpha 3-subunit antisera by a 4-5-fold and 5-10-fold higher affinity for diazepam and beta CCM, respectively. Using the delta-antiserum in immunoaffinity chromatography the delta-subunit was found to be associated with the alpha 1-, alpha 3-, beta 2/3-, and gamma 2-subunits, suggesting that the latter conveys benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity also to GABAA receptors containing the delta-subunit. The receptor population immunoprecipitated by the alpha 5-subunit antiserum (10 +/- 2% of receptors solubilized from whole brain extracts) was characterized by affinities for zolpidem, beta CCM, and CL 218872 which distinguished it from all other known receptor populations. The alpha 5-subunit was associated with the alpha 1-, alpha 3-, beta 2/3- and gamma 2-subunits pointing to differential subunit combinations. Indeed, when receptor populations were immunoprecipitated by the alpha 5-subunit antiserum from different brain regions, zolpidem displayed striking differences in affinity pointing to the role of subunits other than alpha 5 in determining receptor affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1602510116,"The H+:Na+ exchange stoichiometry of NhaA, a sodium-proton antiporter coded by the nhaA gene of Escherichia coli, has been determined using purified NhaA protein reconstituted into sodium-loaded proteoliposomes. One approach involved measuring, in parallel experiments, the Na+ efflux and H+ influx from such proteoliposomes and calculating the stoichiometry from the ratio of these fluxes. A second approach was based on measuring the membrane potential generated by NhaA at various sodium gradients and assuming complete coupling and thermodynamic equilibrium between the membrane potential and the ion gradients. The results from both methods agree with a stoichiometry of 2 H+ exchanged for each Na+. This value is independent of pH between pH 7.2 and 8.1. These results support the suggestion that a change in the catalytic rate of NhaA rather than its stoichiometry is crucial for its role in regulation of intracellular pH in alkaline environments."
https://openalex.org/W1507577640,The cell volume regulatory response to a hypotonic stimulus is frequently initiated by activation of K+ and Cl- channels. We have characterized the hypotonic cell volume regulatory response of human melanoma cells devoid of actin-binding protein (ABP) and their genetically rescued counterpart transfected with the cDNA for ABP. ABP-deficient cells were unable to volume-regulate or activate K+ channels when exposed to a hypotonic stimulus. Genetic rescue with ABP resulted in recovery of both the cell volume regulatory response and the osmotically linked K+ channel activation. These data are consistent with a functional interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and osmotically sensitive ion transport.
https://openalex.org/W1514632623,"The soluble form of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, which has previously been assumed to be cytosolic, has been localized to the nucleus of several cell types. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated a nuclear location in HepG2, NIH-3T3, and L-cells. A comparison of the fluorescence pattern of wild-type CHO cells with a cytidylyltransferase-deficient mutant provided genetic evidence that cytidylyltransferase is nuclear in CHO cells. The enzyme is also predominantly nuclear in rat liver, as revealed by staining frozen sections of that tissue. When L-cells were fractionated by enucleation, over 95% of cytidylyltransferase activity was found in the nuclear fraction, providing biochemical evidence for a nuclear location in these cells. In light of the demonstration that the membrane-bound cytidylyltransferase in CHO cells is associated with the nuclear envelope (Watkins, J. D., and Kent, C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5686-5692), these results suggest that this enzyme is predominantly an intranuclear enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2149464986,"Upon illumination rhodopsin kinase (RK) phosphorylates the visual pigment, rhodopsin, in a reaction that is thought to terminate in part the biochemical events that follow photon absorption. In this paper, RK was studied to assign functional regions to the primary structure of the enzyme. Peptides derived from the sequence of RK were used to prepare site-specific anti-peptide antibodies against: 1) the N-terminal region located between residues 17 and 34, which contains an autophosphorylation site; 2) the Lys/Arg-rich region corresponding to residues 216-237 near the catalytic domain; 3) the region located between residues 483 and 497, which encompasses the major autophosphorylation sites; and 4) the C-terminal region located between residues 539 and 556, close to the isoprenylation site of RK. Antibodies also were raised against purified RK. Application of the antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain blocks RK activity toward Rho*, but has no affect on the phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide substrate. Additionally, a significant portion of the inhibitory effect seen with an antibody directed against whole RK could be reversed by the peptide derived from the N-terminal region. We conclude that the N-terminal region of RK contains a sequence involved in the recognition of photolyzed Rho. Furthermore, the inhibition of RK activity eliminates the effect of ATP during the inactivation of cGMP phosphodiesterase, implying that RK is a necessary component of a cascade of reactions involved in the quenching of phototransduction. Light microscopic immunocytochemistry using these antibodies revealed that RK was localized to the rod and cone outer segments of human and bovine retinas."
https://openalex.org/W1516350423,"We have isolated cDNA clones from human frontal cortex cDNA libraries that encode a unique subtype of the low-Km, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs IV). The 564-amino acid sequence of the protein (human brain PDE IV (hPDE IVB)) shows significant homology to a PDE IV subtype expressed in human monocytes (hPDE IVA), particularly within the approximately 300-amino acid PDE IV catalytic domain. The degree of protein sequence identity is much greater between hPDE IVB and a homolog derived from rat brain (92% over 562 amino acids) than between hPDE IVB and hPDE IVA (76% over 538 amino acids), suggesting a greater subtype-specific versus species-specific conservation of protein sequence. Analysis of the distribution of hPDE IVB mRNA expression revealed a restricted pattern, with an approximately 4-kilobase mRNA detected in brain, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle and not in placenta, liver, kidney, or pancreas. An additional approximately 5-kilobase hPDE IVB-related mRNA species was detected in brain tissue. Recombinant hPDE IVB displayed all of the expected kinetic characteristics for a PDE IV, including sensitivity to the isozyme-selective inhibitor rolipram (Ki = 0.085 microM). Scatchard analysis of (R)-[3H]rolipram binding data suggested the presence of two noninteracting high affinity rolipram-binding sites (Kd = 0.4 and 6 nM) or a negatively cooperative interaction among multiple binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1530611492,"In the ubiquitin (Ub) system for protein degradation, proteins ligated to Ub are degraded by an ATP-dependent 26 S protease complex. During or after proteolysis, free Ub is regenerated, but the mechanisms of Ub release remained unknown. It was previously observed that free Ub is released from a Ub-histone conjugate by an ATP-dependent activity present in partially purified preparations of 26 S complex, but the relationship of this activity to protein breakdown was not established. We now show that purified preparations of 26 S complex release free Ub from conjugates that are good substrates for proteolysis, such as conjugates of lysozyme with reductively methylated Ub. The activity that releases free Ub co-migrates with the 26 S protease complex in glycerol density gradient centrifugation, indicating that the responsible Ub C-terminal hydrolase is an integral part of the 26 S complex. Complex-associated hydrolase can also act on adducts in which a single Ub unit is attached to protein, such as a bacterially expressed construct in which the C terminus of Ub is fused to the alpha-NH2 group of a fragment of Ub that contains 60% of its N-terminal region. In all cases, Ub release is insensitive to Ub-aldehyde (an inhibitor of some Ub C-terminal hydrolases) and is stimulated by MgATP. ATP cannot be replaced by beta, gamma-nonhydrolyzable analogs, but it can be substituted by CTP and GTP. The nucleotide specificity of Ub release by the 26 S complex is similar to that observed previously for conjugate proteolysis and nucleotide hydrolysis. It thus seems that the activity of the Ub C-terminal hydrolase associated with the 26 S complex is tightly coupled to the proteolytic action of the complex, and it may have a role in the release of Ub from linkage to amino groups of the protein substrate at the final stages of the Ub proteolytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2023031734,"The actions of many hormones and neurotransmitters are mediated by the members of a superfamily of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). These receptors are characterized by a highly conserved topographical arrangement in which seven transmembrane domains are connected by intracellular and extracellular loops. The interaction between these receptors and G proteins is mediated in large part by the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Coexpression of the third intracellular loop of the alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor with its parent receptor inhibited receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C. The inhibition extended to the closely related alpha 1C-adrenergic receptor subtype, but not the phospholipase C-coupled M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor nor the adenylate cyclase-coupled D1A dopamine receptor. These results suggest that the receptor-G protein interface may represent a target for receptor antagonist drugs."

https://openalex.org/W1580143110,"After they have been transfected with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2) thymidine kinase (TK) gene murine mammary carcinoma (FM3A) cells become highly sensitive to the growth inhibitory properties of the antiherpetic agents (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU), 9(-)[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine (acyclovir, ACV), 9(-)[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]guanine (DHPG, ganciclovir), and 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methyluracil (FMAU). BVDU was 100-fold more potent an inhibitor of HSV TK gene-transfected tumor cell growth (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50), 0.0020-0.0047 microM) than FMAU or DHPG (IC50, 0.051-0.277 microM) and 1000-fold more potent than ACV (IC50, 0.42-4.9 microM). As a rule, the test compounds were more cytostatic to HSV-2 TK than HSV-1 TK gene-transfected FM3A cells. This may be ascribed to the higher phosphorylating capacity (Vmax/Km) of HSV-2 TK than HSV-1 TK and/or to the higher TK enzyme levels of the HSV-2 TK gene-transfected FM3A cells than the HSV-1 TK gene-transfected FM3A cells. Thymidylate synthase of the HSV TK gene-transfected FM3A cells appears to be the target enzyme for the cytostatic action of BVDU, but not FMAU, DHPG, or ACV. Instead, the cytostatic activity of DHPG seems to be correlated with its conversion to the triphosphate form and subsequent incorporation into the DNA of HSV TK gene-transfected FM3A cells."
https://openalex.org/W1490101125,"Oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) and certain chemically modified LDL are recognized by the scavenger receptor of macrophages. All of these modifications involve charge-neutralizing derivatization of lysine amino groups. However, it remains controversial whether recognition of modified LDL by this receptor is due to the modification per se, or to other factors such as a conformational change of apoB. In this study, LDL and other proteins including bovine serum albumin, human high density lipoprotein, and murine IgG were derivatized with oxidation products generated from arachidonic acid by thermal autoxidation. Modified proteins had increased negative charge, and showed a more than 10-fold enhancement of degradation by mouse peritoneal macrophages via the scavenger receptor pathway. Modification was prevented by blocking lysine residues of the proteins by prior reductive methylation. Amino acid analysis revealed dose-dependent modification of lysine residues with no significant effects on any other amino acid. Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies specific for adducts of oxidation products with lysine prevented the uptake of oxidation product-modified LDL and oxidized LDL by macrophages. Chromatography of oxidation product-modified LDL over Sepharose CL-4B showed that uptake by macrophages did not require LDL aggregation. These results suggest that a relatively simple domain consisting of a cluster of suitably derivatized lysine residues is sufficient for recognition by the scavenger receptor of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1584883422,"Glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cells generate calcium-dependent action potentials. By the control of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, calcium is a tightly regulated second messenger in these cells. It is unknown whether calcium is a signal for glucagon gene transcription. Therefore, rat glucagon reporter fusion genes were transiently transfected into pancreatic islet cell lines. High potassium-induced membrane depolarization activated glucagon gene transcription. The effects of a calcium chelator, calcium channel blockers, calmodulin antagonists, and an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) indicate that depolarization-induced glucagon gene transcription depends on calcium influx and CaM kinase II. The depolarization-responsive element was mapped to the glucagon cAMP-responsive element (CRE). The CRE-binding protein CREB was shown, by using GAL4-CREB fusion proteins, to function as a depolarization-regulated transcription factor in pancreatic islet cells. Membrane depolarization and cAMP had synergistic effects on glucagon gene transcription. These results suggest that rat glucagon gene transcription is regulated by membrane electrical activity and calcium influx in pancreatic islet cells. This signal may be transmitted via CaM kinase II and CREB to the glucagon CRE."
https://openalex.org/W1516692852,"Acetoxymethyl esters of alkyl or aryl phosphates can be prepared by reacting their trialkylammonium or silver salts with acetoxymethyl bromide. Because acetoxymethyl esters are rapidly cleaved intracellularly, they facilitate the delivery of organophosphates into the cytoplasm without puncturing or disruption of the plasma membrane. In addition, acylation of free hydroxyls, for example with butyryl groups, is useful both for synthetic convenience and increased hydrophobicity of the permeant derivatives. The highly polar intracellular messengers cAMP and cGMP were thus converted into uncharged membrane-permeant derivatives. Extracellularly applied N6,2'-O-dibutyryl cAMP acetoxymethyl ester (Bt2cAMP/AM) is shown to simulate intracellular cAMP in three model systems, namely dissociation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in fibroblasts, activation of Cl- secretion of monolayers of the human colon epithelial cell line T84, and dispersion of pigment granules in angel fish melanophores. Bt2cAMP/AM is effective at concentrations two or three orders of magnitude less than those required for commonly used membrane-permeant cAMP derivatives such as Bt2cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, and 8-pCPT-cAMP lacking the acetoxymethyl ester. This methodology should be of general utility for the intracellular delivery of phosphate-containing second messengers."

https://openalex.org/W1647092045,"The mechanism by which oleate induced the translocation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase from the soluble to particulate fraction was studied in HeLa cells. Addition of 0.5 mM oleate caused a 10-fold stimulation of [methyl-3H]choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. The stimulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis was correlated with a decrease in phosphocholine and an increase in CDP-choline, indicating that cytidylyltransferase is regulatory under these conditions. The stimulation of cytidylyltransferase activity upon oleate treatment was concomitant with the translocation of this enzyme from the soluble to particulate fraction. Immunoblot analysis revealed the soluble form as multiple slowly migrating bands, and the particulate form as a faster migrating, single band. The slowly migrating form could be converted to the fast migrating form by phosphatase treatment, suggesting that the mobility difference was due to phosphorylation. In vivo 32P labeling showed that the soluble cytidylyltransferase was highly phosphorylated and the particulate form was much less phosphorylated. The kinetics of the translocation showed that the conversion of the majority of cytidylyltransferase from the soluble to the particulate form occurred within about 15 min following addition of oleate and that the translocation showed a good correlation with dephosphorylation. In contrast, the relocation of cytidylyltransferase from the particulate to the soluble fraction after the removal of oleate occurred within 1 min, and extensive phosphorylation was not required for cytidylyltransferase to leave the membrane. The relocated, soluble cytidylyltransferase was phosphorylated at a much slower rate than that at which the enzyme left the membrane. Immunolocalization showed that the cytidylyltransferase translocated to the nuclear envelope instead of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that activation of cytidylyltransferase by dephosphorylation and translocation to the nuclear envelope may be a general mechanism occurring in many cell types. Moreover, in HeLa cells, multiple mechanism exist for regulating cytidylyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1558541683,"The CDC34 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a 295-residue ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). The function of this ubiquitin-conjugating activity remains to be defined as its in vivo substrates are presently unknown. The bacterially expressed and purified Cdc34 protein is shown here to catalyze its own ubiquitination via an intramolecular transfer of its thiol ester-linked ubiquitin to a lysine. In this process, multiple ubiquitin groups are added to Cdc34, and these ubiquitin groups were shown to be arranged predominantly in the form of a single Lys48-specific multiubiquitin chain. Analysis of the hydroxylamine-dependent cleavage of ubiquitin-Cdc34 conjugates at the single Asn-Gly sequence in Cdc34 placed the major ubiquitin linkage site within the C-terminal 215-295 residues of Cdc34. The 4 Lys residues (Lys273, Lys277, Lys293, and Lys294) in this region of CDC34 were substituted by arginine either singly or in combination to produce a set of Cdc34 mutants. Analysis of these Cdc34 mutants for autoubiquitination revealed that the multiubiquitin chain can be formed on any one of these 4 lysines although most Cdc34 conjugates contain a single multiubiquitin chain. Since the presence of a Lys48-specific multiubiquitin chain in protein conjugates is known to target acceptor proteins for degradation in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway, the present result raises the possibility that one function of the ubiquitin-conjugating activity in CDC34 may be used to target its own degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1491744034,"Incubation of vesicular stomatitis virus-infected cells with short-chain, cell-permeable ceramide (Cer) analogs decreased the rate of viral glycoprotein transport through the Golgi complex and reduced the number of infectious virions released from cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects appeared to be caused directly by Cer, rather than by one of its metabolites. Cer treatment also disrupted the Golgi apparatus within 1 h, although cells treated for up to 24 h with Cer remained viable. Our results suggest that endogenous Cer may modulate secretory protein traffic and that exogenously added Cer analogs may be useful as antiviral agents."

https://openalex.org/W1559021450,"In pursuit of the physiological role of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 3-phosphatase, which also attacks inositol pentakisphosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate with much higher affinity (Nogimori, K., Hughes, P.J., Glennon, M.C., Hodgson, M.E., Putney, J.W., Jr., and Shears, S.B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16499-16506), we have studied the subcellular distribution of the enzyme in liver. Initially, we had to overcome the problem that potent endogenous inhibitor(s) compromise the detection of this enzyme in vitro (Hodgson, M.E., and Shears, S.B. (1990) Biochem. J. 267, 831-834). We partially purified these inhibitor(s) by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration; inhibitory activity co-eluted with standard inositol hexakisphosphate and was depleted by treatment with phytase. Thus, subcellular fractions were pretreated with phytase before assay of 3-phosphatase activity. Our experiments revealed that the hepatic 3-phosphatase was nearly exclusively restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum, and there was little or no activity in either the cytosol, plasma membranes, mitochondria, or nuclei. Detergent treatment of microsomes indicated that there was 93 +/- 2% latency to mannose-6-phosphatase, an intraorganelle enzyme activity (Vanstapel, F., Pua, K., and Blanckaert, N. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 156, 73-77). Similar latencies were found for the hydrolysis of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (95 +/- 1%), inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (94 +/- 1%), and inositol hexakisphosphate (93 +/- 2%). Treatment of microsomes with either sodium carbonate or phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, to release luminal contents, led to solubilization of approximately 90% of 3-phosphatase activity. Thus, hepatic 3-phosphatase has a highly restricted access to inositol polyphosphates in vivo that needs to be accounted for in the determination of the physiological role of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1571692670,"Pigment dispersion in frog melanophores is classically mediated by receptors that activate protein kinase A via an elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP. Here, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, is found to induce pigment dispersion. To demonstrate that an increase in cAMP is not required for the melanosome movement, a murine bombesin receptor was expressed in the melanophores. When these cells were treated with bombesin, they accumulated intracellular inositol phosphates but not cAMP and dispersed their pigment. Four agonists, one partial agonist, and two antagonists for the bombesin receptor were compared for their ability to induce or block bombesin-induced pigment dispersion. In all cases, the degree of pigment dispersion followed simple equilibrium reactions. The resulting dose-response curves allowed for the determination of the effective concentration for half-maximal pigment dispersion (EC50) or half-maximal inhibition of bombesin-stimulated pigment dispersion (IC50) for the peptides. As the pigment dispersion assay can rapidly evaluate chemicals for their effects on receptors that activate phospholipase C via a functional assay, it has potential utility for investigations of ligand-receptor interactions and for massive drug screening."
https://openalex.org/W1931599705,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare, cv. Bomi) leaf ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) was purified to near-homogeneity, using ammonium sulfate fractionation and heat treatment as well as ion exchange, hydrophobic, and dye-ligand chromatography. The enzyme was found to be composed of two subunit types of 51 and 54 kDa, which were recognized by the respective rabbit antibodies against the small and/or large subunit of spinach leaf AGP. Substrate kinetics and product inhibition studies, carried out in the direction of ADP-glucose synthesis, suggested a sequential Iso Ordered Bi Bi kinetic mechanism for the enzyme. In addition, inhibition patterns with CrATP, a dead-end inhibitor of ATP-utilizing enzymes, were consistent with ATP (synthesis reaction) and ADP-glucose (pyrophosphorolysis reaction) binding first to different free forms of the enzyme. The AGP was potently activated by 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) (K alpha of 5 microM) and inhibited by orthophosphate (P(i)), with the ratio of the two effectors playing a major role in modulating AGP activity. At low [PGA]/[P(i)] ratios, P(i) could reverse the activating effect of PGA. However, at the [PGA]/[Pi] ratios of 1.4, or higher, some activating effect of P(i) in the presence of PGA was observed. PGA decreased the Km values for all substrates of AGP (in both the synthesis and pyrophosphorolysis directions). Properties of the barley leaf AGP are compared to those of AGP from barley seed endosperm, which is insensitive to PGA/P(i) regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1506561037,"The helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif is contained in a rapidly growing family of transcription factors and has been shown to mediate dimerization among heterologous HLH-containing proteins. E12 is a widely expressed HLH protein that preferentially forms heterodimers with cell type-specific HLH proteins such as MyoD, myogenin, and the achaete-scute gene products. As a first step toward screening for novel cell type-specific partners of E12, we used a modification of the two-hybrid assay for detection of protein-protein interactions in vivo to determine whether dimerization of HLH proteins with E12 can occur in yeast. Using the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the E12 HLH motif and the GAL4 transcription activation domain fused to MyoD, we show that E12 and MyoD can efficiently dimerize in yeast and reconstruct a hybrid transcription factor that activates reporter genes linked to the GAL4 DNA-binding site. The GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to E12 was used to screen a mouse T-cell cDNA library in which the cDNA was fused to the GAL4 activation domain. Several cDNA clones encoding proteins that interact with E12 were isolated, one of which corresponded to the HLH protein Id-2. Given the ability of E12 to dimerize preferentially with cell type-specific HLH proteins, this strategy should be useful for cloning novel partners for E12 from a variety of cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1548435416,"In guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein- (G protein) coupled receptors, an amphipathic alpha-helix has been postulated to be the common structural determinant in the NH2- and COOH-terminal portions of the third intracellular loop representing the major interaction site with the G proteins. Here we assessed the ability of six peptides derived from these sites of the human dopamine D1-, D2-, and beta 1-adrenergic receptors to either activate G proteins directly or to uncouple the activity of their respective receptors in a native membrane environment. In addition, the cross-reactivity was analyzed. Nonspecific effects occurring at high concentrations were differentiated from G protein-specific effects. The peptide D2N derived from the NH2-terminal part of the third intracellular loop of the dopamine D2 receptor was the only one capable of specifically reversing the action of its receptor, the dopamine-mediated inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, only D2N stimulated pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. However, D2N as the only peptide exhibiting specific effects did not exhibit the predicted amphipathic alpha-helix observed for mastoparan (Higashijima, T., Burnier, J., and Ross, E. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14176-14186) as demonstrated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. In contrast, a peptide for which a certain degree of helicality was verified spectroscopically (D1C) was neither active in GTPase and adenylyl cyclase determinations, nor did it block the receptor-mediated cyclase activation. Hence, the amphipathic alpha-helix does not represent the main structural determinant for the receptor-G protein interaction site."
https://openalex.org/W1529791228,"Thrombomodulin (TM) is a cofactor for activation of protein C by thrombin. We showed that 80-90% of this cofactor activity is lost by oxidation of Met388, located within the short interdomain loop between epidermal growth factor-like domains 4 and 5 (Glaser, C. B., Morser, J., Clarke, J. H., Blasko, E., McLean, K., Kuhn, I., Chang, R.-J., Lin, J.-H., Vilander, L., Andrews, W. H., and Light, D. R. (1992) J. Clin. Invest. 90, 2565-2573). For each of the 3 amino acids of the loop, site-specific mutants are described in which, 1) all possible single amino acid substitutions are made, 2) deletions are made, or 3) alanine is inserted adjacent to each residue of the loop. Most substitutions within the loop (38/57) result in a > 50% decrease in cofactor activity, while changes in the length of this region result in > 90% loss of activity. Only the Met388-->Leu mutant has higher cofactor activity (2-fold) than wild-type TM. A number of soluble and full-length TM analogs with the Met388-->Leu substitution are improved thrombin cofactors, whether produced in bacteria, insect, or mammalian cells. Detailed kinetic analysis of a soluble TM analog consisting of the six EGF-like domains secreted from insect cells shows that the enhanced activity of the Met388-->Leu mutant results from an increased catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). This enhancement is maximal at physiological concentrations of calcium. The loss of activity following Met388 oxidation in the wild-type protein is the result of both decreased binding to thrombin (Kd effect) and a decreased interaction of the TM.thrombin complex with protein C (Km effect). We demonstrate the critical role of this interdomain loop in the biological anticoagulant properties of TM."
https://openalex.org/W1535411738,"We have identified, isolated, and characterized a membrane-associated inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase) from the particulate fraction of human placenta. The enzyme was purified 3700-fold from a detergent extract of human placental membranes to apparent homogeneity, by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, S-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and Biosil SEC 250 HPLC gel filtration. The purified 5-phosphatase has a molecular mass of 43 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme hydrolyzes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) to inositol 1,4 bisphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) with an apparent Km of 5 microM. The 43-kDa 5-phosphatase also hydrolyzes inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) with an apparent Km of 1.2 microM. The enzyme requires Mg2+ ions for activity and is inhibited by Ca2+ concentrations greater than 100 microM. Polyclonal antibodies developed against the membrane-associated enzyme immunoprecipitate the purified membrane-associated placental 5-phosphatase and the platelet Type I cytosolic enzyme, but not the 75-kDa platelet Type II 5-phosphatase. These results demonstrate that the purified membrane 5-phosphatase bears physical and immunological similarity with the Type I cytosolic platelet enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1590726325,"Cytochrome caa3, a cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus, has been purified and extensively characterized as a two-subunit enzyme containing the metal centers characteristic of cytochrome c oxidases (cytochromes a and a3; copper centers CuA and CuB) and an additional cytochrome c (Fee, J. A., Kuila, D., Mather, M. W., and Yoshida, T. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 853, 153-185). We have now cloned and sequenced the genes encoding the subunits of this enzyme. The smaller subunit consists of a typical oxidase subunit II sequence fused to a cytochrome c domain (Mather, M. W., Springer, P., and Fee, J. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5025-5035). The larger subunit, the A-protein, is encoded by a fusion gene lying immediately downstream of the subunit IIc gene. The 5' portion of this gene encodes an oxidase subunit I homolog, whereas the 3' portion is homologous to oxidase subunits III. The A-protein from the purified enzyme appears too small from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitative amino acid analyses to be a complete subunit I/III fusion, but it is currently not known if proteolytic processing occurs. Analyses of the sequences of oxidase subunits are presented which clearly identify T. thermophilus cytochrome caa3 as a bona fide member of the greater family of heme- and copper-requiring oxidases. As one consequence, it is confirmed that the set of invariant histidine residues (potential ligands of the metal centers) in cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II is reduced to 8. Possible topological and helix packing models are developed based on considerations of homology, hydropathy, and variability."
https://openalex.org/W1523629089,"The differential regulation of somatic and testis-specific cytochromes c during spermatogenesis in the mouse is accompanied by changes in mRNA length (Hake, L. E., Alcivar, A. A., and Hecht, N. B. (1990) Development 110, 249-257). In spermatogenic stem cells through early meiotic cells, we detect four somatic cytochrome c (cyt cs) mRNAs of 1.3, 1.1, and 0.7-0.5 kilobases (kb), whereas in postmeiotic cells we detect a larger cyt cs mRNA of 1.7 kb. Oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage of cyt cs mRNA revealed that the 1.7-kb mRNA contains over 1 kb of 5'-untranslated region which is not present in the four shorter cyt cs mRNAs. RNase protection assays indicate that this additional sequence arises from the utilization of an alternative transcription initiation site of the functional cyt cs gene which is 1085 base pairs upstream of the initiation site for the four shorter cyt cs mRNAs. To analyze the promoter for the 1.7-kb mRNA, a genomic clone containing the cyt cs gene and 5 kb of 5'-flanking DNA was isolated. Sequence comparison of the putative promoter region with promoters of other postmeiotically expressed genes reveals several conserved regions. Utilization of this alternative initiation site may be involved in the down-regulation of cytochrome cs during spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1534034859,"UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 3GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 1-6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (i.e. core 2 GlcNAc-T) of the O-linked oligosaccharide pathway is developmentally regulated in human T cells, and changes in its activity have been associated with malignancies and the Wiskott-Aldrich immunodeficiency syndrome. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells normally express low levels of core 2 GlcNAc-T activity (8-12 pmol/mg/h) which can be accurately measured with a two-step assay employing purified bovine beta 1-4Gal-T and high specific activity UDP-[3H]Gal to radiolabel the core 2 reaction product. CHO cells treated with 2 mM sodium butyrate for 24 h exhibited a 16-fold increase in core 2 GlcNAc-T activity, whereas several other differentiating agents including dimethyl sulfoxide, retinoic acid, phorbol ester, and cholera toxin had no effect on activity. The addition of butyrate, cholera toxin, or dimethyl sulfoxide to CHO cells slowed cell proliferation and induced changes in cell morphology characteristic of cell differentiation. Induction of core 2 GlcNAc-T by butyrate was blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Butyrate treatment also elevated cytosolic cAMP levels with a time course which paralleled, but preceded, induction of core 2 GlcNAc-T activity by approximately 8 h. The protein kinase inhibitors H-7 and H-8 blocked butyrate-dependent induction of enzyme activity, whereas the inactive analogue H1004 had no effect. Core 2 GlcNAc-T showed a change in Km for UDP-GlcNAc, from 0.50 mM in untreated cells to 4.54 mM in butyrate + cholera toxin treated CHO cells, but no changes in Km for the synthetic acceptor, Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha-para-nitrophenyl. Despite the 9-fold increase in Km for sugar nucleotide, Vmax/Km was 8.8-fold greater in treated compared with untreated cells. These observations suggest that in CHO cells induction of core 2 GlcNAc-T by butyrate treatment requires de novo gene transcription/translation, activation of protein kinase(s), and is associated with changes in the kinetic properties of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1552785074,"pp57 is a cytoplasmic kinase which is related antigenically and functionally to the extracellular signal regulated kinase or the mitogen-activated kinase family of signal transduction proteins. Two undifferentiated colon carcinoma cell lines responded to the diacylglycerol diolein by growth and a rapid 3-4-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of pp57, and smaller increases in threonine and serine phosphorylation. By enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation of pp57, diolein increased pp57 kinase activity on myelin basic protein. Two enterocytic differentiated colon carcinoma cell lines, when treated with diolein, exhibited neither increased pp57 tyrosine phosphorylation nor increased growth. Both enterocytic lines exhibited 30% of the total PKC activity, 10-20% of the abundance of PKC beta as detected by Western blotting with anti-peptide antisera, and 10-20% of the PKC beta activity, by immune complex kinase reactions, that was expressed in the undifferentiated cell lines. The abundance of three other PKC isozymes, alpha, epsilon, and zeta appeared unchanged in the undifferentiated and enterocytic lines, reflecting their common parental cell line origin. The association between loss of PKC beta activity and blocked signaling through pp57 in each of two cell lines suggests that PKC beta is part of a signal transduction system activating pp57."
https://openalex.org/W1600580653,"The multipotent drug suramin, which is currently being studied as an anticancer agent, was found to inhibit the interaction between the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and its cellular receptor. 50% inhibition of binding was obtained with a suramin concentration between 30 and 60 micrograms/ml when using U937 cells and a ligand concentration of 0.3 nM. This concentration of the drug is well below the serum levels found in suramin-treated patients. Inhibition of binding was also demonstrated at the molecular level, using chemical cross-linking or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type technique based on the ligand interaction. The inhibition was not caused by a mere polyanion effect since polysulfates such as heparin, heparan sulfate, and pentosan polysulfate were non-inhibitory or showed only a very weak inhibition. However, polysulfonated compounds with structures resembling suramin (i.e. trypan blue and Evans blue) did prove inhibitory. The inhibition found with suramin showed a concentration dependence consistent with a mixed competitive and noncompetitive mechanism. The off-rate of prebound ligand was accelerated by the drug. It is speculated that the present effect may contribute to the anti-invasive properties of suramin by destroying the cellular potential for localized plasminogen activation and proteolytic matrix degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1598299012,"Previous nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that the conformation of the signal peptide of rat liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in a micelle environment contained a N-helix and a C-helix which were separated by a flexible hinge region (Karslake, C., Piotto, M.E., Pak, Y.K., Weiner, H. and Gorenstein, D. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 9872-9878). Deletion of either helix from the presequence caused complete loss of the precursor import. Switching the positions of the two helices had little effect on import but decreased processing efficiency. Import was not affected by replacing the C-helix with the N-terminal helix of the presequence of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, however, it was decreased by replacing the C-helix with the C-terminal random coil of the oxidase's presequence. Circular dichroism studies on the synthesized signal peptides indicated that a helix in the C-segment of aldehyde dehydrogenase signal peptide was needed to stabilize the N-helix. It is concluded that a stable helix in the N-terminal region is necessary for a functional mitochondrial presequence. This helix could be obtained from its own sequence, or from the interaction with other portions of the presequence."
https://openalex.org/W1492785044,"We have recently reported two non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients exhibiting a heterozygous point mutation (R1152-Q) next to the key tyrosine autophosphorylation sites (Y1146, Y1150, Y1151) of the insulin receptor. In the present study, we demonstrate that the Q1152 mutation alters a previously unrecognized consensus sequence the insulin receptor family of tyrosine kinases. To define the effect of this alteration on insulin receptor function, the mutant insulin receptor (Q1152) was constructed and overexpressed NIH-3T3 cells. In spite of normal insulin binding, in vivo and in vitro autophosphorylation as well as transphosphorylation by the wild-type receptor (WT) were deficient Q1152 as compared with the transfected WT receptors. Insulin-stimulated kinase activity toward poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 and the endogenous substrates p120 and p175 were also impaired Q1152. However, insulin-independent kinase activity of Q1152 was 2-5-fold higher than that of WT. While insulin stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake and glycogen synthase activity WT-transfected cells with a sensitivity proportional to receptor number, no insulin stimulation was observed Q1152 cells. Similar to the kinase, insulin-independent glycogen synthase activity and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were 2-fold higher Q1152 than either WT or parental cells. We conclude that the Q1152 mutation deregulates insulin receptor kinase and generates insulin insensitivity cells. Alterations this highly conserved region of the insulin receptor may contribute to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitin pathogenesis humans."
https://openalex.org/W1498993468,"Protein kinases in neutrophils that undergo changes in activity during cell stimulation have been investigated by two recently described procedures. These methods are based on the ability of renatured kinases to undergo autophosphorylation or to phosphorylate protein substrates fixed in gels. Using these techniques, we report that neutrophils contain a battery of protein kinases with molecular masses of 65-61 kDa (termed A kinases) that are rapidly activated upon stimulation of the cells with the chemotactic peptide N-fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Activity was maximal within 30 s with this stimulus and returned to the basal level seen in unstimulated cells within 3 min. In contrast, stimulation of neutrophils with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in a diminution of these kinase activities. Treatment of neutrophils with antagonists of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases (calyculin A, okadaic acid) inhibited the activation of the group A kinases by fMLP, whereas norokadanone, an analog of okadaic acid that is a poor inhibitor of protein phosphatases, had no effect. Exposure of neutrophils to calyculin A alone resulted in the activation of several additional protein kinases with molecular masses different from the group A kinases. These data indicate that the signal transduction pathways of neutrophils are likely to be far more complicated than previously appreciated and involve a number of uncharacterized protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2116875174,"A cell-based transactivation assay was established using the mouse full-length peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) cDNA sequence and the positive peroxisome proliferator-responsive regulatory element (-578 to -553) of the rat acyl-CoA oxidase gene promoter. Activation of the reporter plasmid was dependent on co-transfection of the full-length PPAR cDNA, and the response was greatly stimulated, up to 100-fold, by peroxisome proliferators such as Wy-14,643 ([4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio] acetic acid), nafenopin (2-methyl-2[p-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl)phenoxy]-propionic acid), and clofibric acid (2-([p]-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid). Activation of the reporter plasmid promoter by the full-length PPAR cDNA also occurred at peroxisomal proliferator concentrations 40 times lower than that required for similar stimulation by a glucocorticoid-PPAR chimeric receptor. By using the stereoisomers of MK-571 ((+-)-3-(((3-(2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl)-phenyl)((3- (dimethylamino)-3-oxopropyl)-thio)methyl)-thio)propanoic acid), a potent leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist, we could show enantioselective activation of PPAR. The use of this compound in mice results in peroxisome proliferation; however, nearly all of the peroxisome proliferating activity can be attributed to the S enantiomer. Our results show a similar enantiomeric discrimination in PPAR activation of the reporter plasmid promoter, where again most of the activity can be attributed to the S enantiomer. The equivalent activities of these stereoisomers both in vivo and in the PPAR transactivation assay strongly implicate PPAR as a major component of the peroxisome proliferating mechanism in rodents."
https://openalex.org/W1554507532,"In a search for factors that influence the process of erythroid differentiation at the molecular level, we have identified UB2, a nuclear protein factor that was originally observed for its ability to bind to a very specific and highly conserved sequence motif present in human, mouse, rabbit, and chicken beta-globin genes, as well as carbonic anhydrase I, c-myb, and the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer region. It was also observed for its appearance in undifferentiated but not differentiated mouse erythroleukemia cells. Purification of UB2 by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and repeated passages through a DNA affinity column, revealed a complex pattern with three major components of 170, 116, and 48 kDa, respectively. The 170-kDa protein was identified as topoisomerase (topo) II by Western blot analysis, catalytic assays, and antibody interference with UB2 binding. The complex topo II in UB2, however, has a more stringent sequence requirement for DNA binding than does topo II. The 116-kDa protein has been determined to be a proteolytic product of topo II. The chromosome scaffold protein 2 (135 kDa) copurified with UB2, and anti-scaffold protein 2 serum inhibited UB2 binding to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1481500391,"Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are important in regulating cellular functions by controlling the phosphorylation state of their substrates. In human monocytes, the inhibitors of these phosphatases, okadaic acid and calyculin A, were found to increase the mRNA accumulation and cytokine production of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-1 alpha. The increased mRNA accumulation was found to be primarily because of the increase in the transcription rate of the interleukin-1 genes. Stimulation of interleukin-1 gene transcription may be caused by the stimulation of transcription factor activities, including those of AP-1, by these protein phosphatase inhibitors. Okadaic acid increased the synthesis of the interleukin-1 beta precursor and mature forms and their secretion. This increased processing and secretion correlated with the stimulation of IL-1 beta convertase mRNA accumulation. The stimulation of interleukin-1 alpha production by okadaic acid was more modest than that of interleukin-1 beta. However, the phosphorylation of the precursor interleukin-1 alpha cytokine was increased. These results show that protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors exert multiple effects on cytokine production in human monocytes and suggest that these two phosphatases play important roles in regulating interleukin-1 production."
https://openalex.org/W1582522203,"A DNA polymerase with a 3'-to 5'-exonuclease that copurified with polymerase-primase from calf thymus was purified and extensively characterized. Its exonuclease degraded single-stranded DNA from 3' to 5' in a strictly distributive manner. On synthetic template-primer junctions, 3'-terminal mispairs were excised with a 10- to 20-fold preference over correctly paired nucleotides. In comparison to the 3'- to 5'-exonuclease the DNA polymerase activity was rather low. The ratio of nucleotides incorporated to nucleotides excised was in the order of 1 to 3 nucleotide insertions per excision, suggesting that net forward DNA synthesis is not the primary role of this DNA polymerase. DNA synthesis was performed with a low processivity in the presence and absence of PCNA. Both the polymerase and exonuclease activities were inhibited to a comparable extent by AMP. Thus, the exonuclease-polymerase might represent a novel DNA polymerase that we tentatively designate as DNA polymerase zeta. Possible benefits of DNA polymerase zeta in the process of error correction and the apparent dichotomy of an built-in proofreading activity for the processive DNA polymerases gamma, delta, and epsilon and an obviously external proofreading function for the less processive animal cell DNA polymerases alpha and beta are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1555596835,"The synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-phosphate and PI 4,5-bisphosphate in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is stimulated by glucose. PI 4-kinase (ATP:phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.67) catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of these phosphoinositides. Previous studies have suggested that the glucose effect on phosphoinositide synthesis is mediated by cellular levels of ATP and ADP and by the RAS/cAMP pathway. Using purified preparations of the membrane-associated 45- and 55-kDa forms of PI 4-kinase, we examined the regulation of these activities by nucleotides and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. MgADP was a potent inhibitor of both forms of the enzyme. Detailed kinetic analyses of the 45- and 55-kDa enzymes using Triton X-100/PI-mixed micelles showed that MgADP was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.14 and 0.25 mM, respectively) with respect to MgATP and a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 1.3 and 0.9 mM, respectively) with respect to PI. The Ki values for MgADP were about 2-fold lower than the Km values the enzymes have for their substrate MgATP and about 2-fold lower than the cellular concentration of ADP. The 45- and 55-kDa forms of PI 4-kinase activity were regulated differentially by CTP, an important nucleotide involved in phospholipid biosynthesis. Whereas the 55-kDa PI 4-kinase was inhibited by CTP, the 45-kDa enzyme was unaffected by CTP. CTP was a mixed type of inhibitor (Ki = 1.5 mM) with respect to MgATP and a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 4 mM) with respect to PI. The Ki value for CTP was 4-fold higher than the Km value for MgATP and 7-fold higher than the cellular concentration of CTP. The 45- and 55-kDa PI 4-kinases were neither phosphorylated nor regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These results did not support the previous conclusion that PI 4-phosphate synthesis was mediated by the RAS/cAMP pathway. Our kinetic studies supported the conclusion that the glucose effect on the synthesis of PI 4-phosphate was mediated by cellular levels of ATP and ADP through the regulation of membrane-associated PI 4-kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1541612896,"The primary structure of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK) from Propionibacterium freudenreichii exhibits a low but significant level of sequence identity with Escherichia coli ATP-dependent PFK, permitting the tentative assignment of residues that may be involved in catalysis. Based on these assignments, the roles in catalysis of 2 aspartyl residues (Asp151 and Asp153) and 2 lysyl residues (Lys80 and Lys85) were examined. Mutagenesis of the Asp151 to alanine and serine reduced kcat by a factors of 2 x 10(4) and 4 x 10(5), respectively, while showing no change in Km for either substrate in the forward reaction or for metal ion in the back reaction. The kcat for Asp153 was decreased by a factor of 700 with no change in Km for pyrophosphate and an increase of about 20-fold in Km for fructose 6-P and close to 4-fold for magnesium ion. That these changes in the mutants were not the result of global conformational changes was indicated by their identical behavior during substrate-specific elution chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and limited proteolysis by trypsin and subtilisin. Mutations of Lys80 and Lys85 showed no significant changes in kinetic parameters, suggesting no involvement in mechanism or substrate binding. These and other results permit preliminary modeling of the active site of pyrophosphate-dependent PFK."
https://openalex.org/W1595821400,"The effect of temperature on the electronic structure of cytochromes a and a3 has been determined at two different concentrations of the solubilizing detergent, N-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside. In each case, an incubation temperature of 40 degrees C resulted in a 20-30% increase in the 430-nm conformer of cytochrome a3 when compared with a 20 degrees C control, but the higher detergent concentration led to additional formation of a new charge transfer band at 630 nm. Induction of this new feature was correlated with a loss of alpha-band intensity, a blue shift in the Soret absorbance, and a decrease in the Soret magnetic circular dichroism. The absorbance changes were associated with isosbestic wavelengths at 613, 581, 563, 453, and 416 nm, indicating a two-state electronic conversion. The loss of magnetic circular dichroism intensity and the lack of an isosbestic point between 630 and 655 nm were consistent with a selective effect on the electronic structure of ferricytochrome a. Comparison of these spectral changes with the model heme a studies of Carter and Palmer (Carter, K., and Palmer, G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13507-13514) provides evidence for a low to high spin transition in cytochrome a in which one of the axial Fe-N bonds is either broken or sterically strained. This selective effect on cytochrome a and the associated thermal resistance of the a3-CuB domain are discussed in terms of the 4-helix bundle motif that has been recently proposed for the catalytic site of cytochrome c oxidase."
