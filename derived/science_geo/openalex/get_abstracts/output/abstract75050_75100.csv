https://openalex.org/W1558958162,"Two new intermediates were identified in the protocatechuate pathway of Pseudomonas putida. The first of these, γ-carboxymuconolactone (γ-carboxy-γ-carboxymethyl-Δα-butenolide), is the product of the enzymic lactonization of β-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate. Enzymic decarboxylation of γ-carboxymuconolactone gives rise to β-ketoadipate enollactone (γ-carboxymethyl-Δβ-butenolide), the second newly discovered intermediate in the protocatechuate pathway. β-Ketoadipate enol-lactone, which was isolated and physically characterized, is also an intermediate in the catechol pathway; the catechol and protocatechuate pathways converge at this point. β-Ketoadipate enol-lactone is hydrolyzed to β-ketoadipate by an enzyme which is essential for utilization of either catechol or protocatechuate. Studies with Moraxella lwoffii showed that this organism also degrades protocatechuate and catechol by the pathways characteristic of P. putida. Elucidation of the bacterial pathway for the dissimilation of protocatechuate revealed that the three step-reactions responsible for the conversion of this compound to β-ketoadipate enol-lactone are analogous with the step-reactions responsible for the conversion of catechol to β-ketoadipate enol-lactone."

Sequential treatment of asialoceruloplasmin with galactose oxidase and tritiated borohydride resulted in the incorporation of tritium into at least 4 residues of D-galactose of the protein molecule.
https://openalex.org/W1653512209,"Abstract An enzyme was extracted from rat brain and purified about 100-fold. It catalyzed a reversible reaction in which the amide bond of ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) was either hydrolyzed or synthesized. The hydrolysis of ceramide to sphingosine and fatty acid had a pH optimum of 4.8, required cholate or taurocholate, and was inhibited by both sphingosine and fatty acid. N-Palmitoyl-, N-stearoyl-, and N-oleylsphingosine or dihydrosphingosine were hydrolyzed, but N-acetylsphinogsine, N-lignoceryldihydrosphingosine, cerebroside, and sphingomyelin did not serve as substrates in this reaction. The synthesis of ceramide from sphingosine and fatty acid also had a pH optimum of 4.8 and required cholate. It was not inhibited by fatty acid at pH 8, but was inhibited at pH 5 by fatty acid concentrations greater than 3 x 10-4 M."

https://openalex.org/W1491417004,"Abstract Study of the regulation of the syntheses of enzymes of the catechol and protocatechuate pathways in Pseudomonas putida has shown that two groups of enzymes are subject to coordinate control. cis,cis-Muconate-lactonizing enzyme and muconolactone isomerase, which are uniquely associated with the catechol pathway, constitute the first coordinate block of enzymes. The synthesis of these enzymes, as well as that of catechol oxygenase (which is regulated independently), seems to be induced by cis,cis-muconate. The second coordinate block of enzymes comprises β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing enzyme and γ-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, which are uniquely associated with the protocatechuate pathway, and β-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase, which is functional in both the protocatechuate and the catechol pathways. This group of enzymes seems to be induced by β-ketoadipate or β-ketoadipyl coenzyme A. Moraxella lwoffii, which degrades protocatechuate and catechol through identical step-reactions, regulates the synthesis of the enzymes mediating these conversions by a different mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1524688180,"Extracts of benzoate-grown Pseudomonas putida have high levels of β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing enzyme and γ-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, even though these enzymes are uniquely associated with the protocate-chuate pathway. Since these activities might result from nonspecific catalysis by the enzymes which catalyze the analogous reactions in the catechol pathway, cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing enzyme and muconolactone isomerase were purified extensively and their specificities were examined. Crystalline preparations had no detectable activity on the carboxylated substrate analogues of the parallel convergent pathway. The enzymes of the catechol pathway do, however, share some physical characteristics with the enzymes that catalyze the analogous reactions in the protocatechuate pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1611493774,"Abstract An enzyme was extracted from rat brain particles and was purified 18-fold. It hydrolyzed sphingomyelin (1-O-phosphorylcholine-2-N-acylsphingosine) to ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) and phosphorylcholine, but did not catalyze the hydrolysis of lecithin. The reaction was not reversible and had a pH optimum of 5.0 and a Km of 1.3 x 10-4 M. The enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelins with D-erythro-sphingosine or dihydrosphingosine 3 to 5 times faster than those with D-threo or L-erythro configuration. It was inhibited by ceramide, sphingosine, and fatty acid, but not by phosphorylcholine. Sphingomyelin could be hydrolyzed to sphingosine, fatty acid, and phosphorylcholine by the combined action of this enzyme and of ceramidase."
https://openalex.org/W1482041278,"An enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of L -tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide has been isolated from cells of Pseudomonas savastanoi and purified 89-fold. The enzyme catalyzes a reaction in which 1 mole of L -tryptophan and 1 mole of O2 are consumed and 1 mole of indole-3-acetamide and 1 mole of CO2 are produced. The enzyme has a pH optimum between 7.2 and 9.2. It is specific for the L isomer of tryptophan and attacks 5-hydroxytryptophan at a rate approximately 17% of that for L -tryptophan. It shows slight activity toward L -phenylalanine and L -tyrosine but no activity toward indole-3-pyruvic acid, indole-3-acetaldehyde, α-methyltryptophan, or indole-3-acetic acid. Indole-3-acetamide brings about end product inhibition and, at a concentration of 1 m M , reduces the rate of oxidation of L -tryptophan by 85%. Hydroxylamine, HgCl2, iodoacetamide, and indole-3-acetic acid are effective inhibitors of the enzyme. Tryptophan oxidative decarboxylase is suggested for the trivial name for this enzyme."

The polymers closely resemble alginic acid, a seaweed polysaccharide, as shown by composition, infrared spectra, and alginase digestion. The new polysaccharides from Pseudomonas appear to contain O-acetyl groups, which are not known to be present in the alginates."
https://openalex.org/W1559174409,"Abstract A polarographic technique was used to demonstrate the rapid restoration by bovine serum albumin of respiratory control to rat liver mitochondria uncoupled with various reagents. Albumin also restored respiratory control to mitochondria isolated from animals treated by injection with an uncoupling reagent and to mitochondria incubated with the reagent prior to the polarographic assay. Albumin was effective with the nitro- and halo-substituted phenols, thyroxine, Dicumarol, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2-trifluoromethylbenzimidazole. Albumin was ineffective in counteracting the inhibitory action of gramicidin, antimycin A, oligomycin, and rotenone. Although the addition of an amount of albumin equimolar to that of the uncoupling reagent present had a substantial effect, amounts of the protein at least twice equimolar were required for the rapid and essentially complete restoration of respiratory control with most of the reagents tested."

https://openalex.org/W2056476767,"As background for a report on our current selective adaptation experiments in decapod crustaceans, the various facts and hypotheses generally relevant to intraretinal sensitivity to polarized light in arthropods as well as cephalopods have been marshaled. On the basis of this review, the following working hypotheses have been made. 1) One ommatidium in the compound eye is the functional unit in image perception but contains in its component retinular cells subunits which can work independently in detecting other visual parameters, such as polarization. 2) Single retinular cells do respond differentially to light polarized in various planes. 3) Light sensitivity, including e-vector detection, is localized in the rhab domeres, which comprise closely packed arrays of microvilli protruding axially from retinular cells; the dichroism of the photopigment molecules, which are contained within the microvilli, provides the molecular basis of e-vector detection. 4) The visual pigment molecules have their major dichroic axis aligned predominantly parallel to the long axis of the microvillus containing them; typically all microvilli in a single rhab domere are closely parallel to one another, thus comprising at the cellular level a unit dichroic analyzer with maximum optical density to photons vibrating in the direction parallel to these microvillous protrusions. 5) In most decapod crustaceans, in cephalopods, and in some insects the microvilli in all rhabdomeres of a retinula are oriented in only two directions, perpendicular. to each other. Therefore, e-vector perception must depend at the retinular level on a two channel system consisting of a pair of dichroic analyzers with their major transmitting axes fixed at a 90 degrees angle determined by the two directions of microvillus orientation. Our new results on selective adaptation in the eye of Cardisoma provide direct experimental evidence for such a two-channel analyzer in which the pair of functional units have their maximum sensitivity to polarization in the same retinal directions as the rhab dom microvilli observed in electron micrographs. In turn, these directions correspond with the vertical and horizontal axes of the animal's normal spatial orientation. In e-vector detection the seven retinular cells of a single decapod ommatidium thus form two operational subgroups of four and three cells, respectively (39). The correspondence of the electrophysiological evidence for a dual polarization analyzer with the perpendicular directions shown by the microvilli in a single rhabdom strengthens the idea that one ommatidium is enough for detecting e-vector orientation. On this evidence we may conclude that the model developed above for a two-channel polarization analyzer effectively accounts for the relevant spectrophotometric, fine-structural, electrophysiological, and behavioral data currently available for a considerable number of arthropods and cephalopods."

https://openalex.org/W1899186545,"Abstract The reaction of rabbit muscle myokinase (adenosine triphosphate-adenosine monophosphate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.3) with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and p-mercuribenzenesulfonate in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl results in the stoichiometric blocking of both sulfhydryl groups on the enzyme molecule and the formation of myokinase-mercurial complexes possessing about 45% of their initial activity. Kinetic studies show that the Km of the myokinase-p-hydroxymercuribenzoate complex does not differ significantly from that of intact myokinase, indicating that the sulfhydryl groups are not involved in substrate binding. Reaction of myokinase with structural analogues of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate results in the formation of myokinase-mercurial complexes that possess varying amounts of initial enzymatic activity. Inhibition increases with increasing size of the mercurial substituted. The role which the sulfhydryl groups might have in processes other than substrate binding or enzyme catalysis is discussed, along with possible steric effects brought about by the mercurial substituents. An improved method for the purification of myokinase is also described."

https://openalex.org/W2073805658,"Reciprocal control mechanisms between hemoprotein and 8-aminolevulinic acid synthetase take part in coordinate synthesis of the heme and apoenzyme moieties of tryptophan pyrrolase. Stimulation of heme biosynthesis increases tryptophan pyrrolase, whereas enhancement of heme binding by apotryptophan pyrrolase secondarily increases the formation of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in heme formation. Tryptophan-mediated induction of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase suggests that heme participates in repression of that enzyme"
https://openalex.org/W1575104933,"Abstract Continuing studies with erythrocytic nucleoside diphosphokinase suggest that enzyme preparations of specific activity of 100 µM units per mg of protein are near homogeneity, and that the molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 100,000. Evidence is presented which confirms previous findings that the enzyme becomes phosphorylated by reaction with adenosine triphosphate. The occurrence of one or more essential thiol group(s) in the region of the catalytic site(s) is noted. Inactivation of the thiol(s) may be prevented by the presence of a nucleotide substrate or inhibitor. Nucleoside diphosphokinase inactivated by reaction with mercuribenzoate may be reactivated by incubation with the thiol reagent, dithiothreitol. Erythrocytic nucleoside diphosphokinase catalyzes exchange between ADP and ATP, but not between orthophosphate and ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1545176052,"Abstract An enzyme present in the microsomes of small intestinal mucosa cells was partially purified by a combination of several conventional methods: solubilization with deoxycholate, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, diethylaminoethyl Sephadex column chromatography, carboxymethyl Sephadex treatment, and finally starch zone electrophoresis. The purified enzyme preparation had a specific activity 300 times that of the starting homogenate. The enzyme showed little if any hydrolytic activity on long chain di- and triglycerides, cholesterol esters, lecithin, and acetylcholine. It hydrolyzed all medium and long chain monoglycerides tested, except monostearin, and a variety of short chain esters including mono-, and di-, triglycerides as well as methyl and ethyl esters. The substrate specificity pattern indicates that this enzyme acts on soluble substrates and might be considered an esterase proper rather than a lipase. However, since this enzyme has been previously referred to as monoglyceride lipase together with the fact that the most probable physiological substrates are long chain monoglycerides, this designation might be preferable."
https://openalex.org/W1593011187,"Abstract An enzyme which catalyzes the aromatization of cyclohexanecarboxyl coenzyme A has been isolated from whole liver as well as from liver mitochondria. Incubation of the soluble, partially purified enzyme with cyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA produces cyclohexene-1-carboxyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA, and a polar compound which has not been further characterized. All three isomers of cyclohexenecarboxyl-CoA are converted to benzoyl-CoA by the liver enzyme, but evidence is presented indicating that only cyclohexene-1-carboxyl-CoA lies on the path from cyclohexanecarboxyl-CoA to benzoyl-CoA. Aromatization takes place either in air or anaerobically in the presence of artificial electron acceptors. The enzyme system is inactivated by low pH and activity is restored by the addition of flavin adenine dinucleotide."

The first are primarily Arab, but with varying degrees of African mixture, while the second are Nilotic–Hamitic Africans. The latter can be divided into Northern and Southern Nilotes. Among some groups of Southern Nilotes, haemoglobin S is common1,2, but it is absent or low in the Northern Nilotes, for example, Dinka, Shilluk and Nuer3. Occasionally, also, haemoglobin Stanleyville II is found which relates these populations to their southern and western neighbours4,5. In the Northern Sudanese, sickling is found at a low, but constant, rate in Khartoum (182 of 9,100 examined, that is, 2 per cent) and at a more variable rate in Western Sudan6. It seems that the Northern Sudanese possess haemoglobin O which relates them to their Arab neighbours. Indeed, haemoglobin O Arab was first reported in an Arab family in Israel7, but it has recently been found also in Bulgaria8."
https://openalex.org/W1487480344,Abstract Nearest neighbor frequencies and base composition of ribonucleic acid synthesized by the prostatic nuclei of castrated rats were altered by the injection of testosterone to the animals. Actinomycin D in vitro minimizes such differences. The results indicate that the androgen selectively enhances the synthesis of ribonucleic acids rich in guanine and cytosine.
https://openalex.org/W1550542945,"Abstract The increased isocitrate consumption of isolated rat liver mitochondria brought about by the addition of L-malate is quantitatively accounted for by increases in the production of both α-ketoglutarate and citrate. The effect on citrate production is still observed under conditions such that the oxidation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate is completely inhibited. The specificity of the effect has been investigated, and it is shown that a number of dicarboxylic acids can stimulate isocitrate metabolism in a similar fashion. Marked stereospecificity is indicated by the fact that among the tartrate stereoisomers only the meso form is active."
https://openalex.org/W1558274067,"Abstract The hydrolysis of a series of esters of benzoyl-L-arginine and glycylglycine by papain has been examined in mixtures of water with various alcohols in the pH range of 5 to 6. The presence of straight chain alcohols resulted in an apparent inhibition of acid release. It was shown that this inhibition could, in part, be accounted for by papain-catalyzed transesterification reactions between the various substrates and the alcohols studied. The products of transesterification, transamidation, and hydrolysis resulting on incubation of papain with esters of glycylglycine were separated and identified, and the kinetics of their formation were examined. Ficin was found to behave similarly to papain. The present study, in conjunction with earlier reports, suggests that the ability to catalyze alcoholytic reactions may be a property of many hydrolytic enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1493833128,"Abstract This communication reports several independent observations which suggest that O-acetylhomoserine is an intermediate in methionine biosynthesis in Neurospora. Indirect evidence has long implicated three unlinked genes (me-3, me-5, me-7) in a hypothetical series of reactions leading to the formation of cystathionine from homoserine and cysteine in Neurospora, but the metabolic defects associated with mutations in these genes have not been ascertained. It has now been shown that me-5 mutants, but not me-3 or me-7, will grow in the presence of O-acetylhomoserine. Second, when grown in the presence of methionine and labeled homoserine, me-5 mutants fail to accumulate two compounds which are formed by me-3, me-7, and wild type: O-acetylhomoserine, and a larger amount of 4-O-acetyl-2,4-dihydroxybutyrate. Third, me-5 mutants lack an enzyme catalyzing an exchange between labeled homoserine and O-acetylhomoserine."
https://openalex.org/W1513649436,"Abstract Modified techniques suitable for preparation and enzymatic digestion of aminoethylated Bence-Jones proteins are described. Most of the peptides on a tryptic peptide map of aminoethylated Bence-Jones protein Ag have been assigned a number descriptive of their sequence and position in the molecule. Of 24 predicted peptides in a tryptic digest of this Type K protein, 22 have been identified, some tentatively, on a peptide map. Of 13 peptides in the constant portion of the molecule, 12 have been identified on the peptide maps of five other aminoethylated Bence-Jones proteins of Type K. The aminoethylcysteinyl peptides of these six proteins have been characterized and, by analogy to known sequences, have been numbered tentatively according to their order in the molecule. Although not all the predicted peptides were identifiable, aminoethylation permits a rapid comparative survey of structural differences among Bence-Jones proteins. One disulfide bridge is in the carboxyl half of the κ chain, which has an invariant sequence except for a single valine-leucine interchange apparently associated with the Inv genetic factor. The second disulfide bridge in the amino terminal half may vary in position in different Type K proteins and is associated with multiple differences in amino acid sequence."

The structure proposed for this compound is Δ7, 24-cholestadien-3β-ol, on the basis of the following evidence. 1. The optical rotation is similar to that of Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol. 2. Hydrogenation with Raney nickel catalyst yields a compound with chromatographic behavior similar to that of Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol. 3. Hydrogenation with palladium catalyst yields a compound with an infrared spectrum indistinguishable from that of δ8(14)-cholesten-3β-ol. Approximately 1 mole of hydrogen is absorbed per mole of sterol. 4. The elemental composition is correct for the proposed structure. 5. The infrared spectrum is similar to that of Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol, except for the differences to be expected from the presence of the Δ24 bond. 6. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum differs from that of Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol in the ways predicted. Δ7, 24-Cholestadien-3β-ol is biologically convertible to Δ7-cholesten-3β-ol and to cholesterol. It can be derived from Δ8, 24-cholestadien-3β-ol, but the reverse reaction could not be shown."

With the refinements of the thiobarbituric method7 for a semi-specific assay of N-acetyl neuraminic acid, we have made use of this method to investigate the changes with age in the concentration of plasma-bound sialic acid in the rat in an initial effort to use experimental animals in the investigation of the physiological significance of glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2042441542,"IT is generally assumed that there is a diploid number of chromosomes in nearly all human somatic cells. That this is not true for the endometrium was first reported by Timonen1 in 1950. He found chromosome numbers ranging from 4 to 104 in 1,000 cells of human endometrium. Manna2 observed similar aneuploidy in this tissue. Sachs3, on the other hand, found no variation from the normal diploid number in either human or rat endometrium. Walker and Boothroyd4, although they found chromosome counts ranging from 42 to 56, believed that the apparent aneuploidy was caused by the methods used, and suggested that Timonen's results were similar artefacts produced by the technique. Since all these investigators used squash preparations without previous hypotonic treatment, it is quite possible that in some cases accurate counts were not possible or that fragmentation occurred. Furthermore, the human diploid chromosome number was, at that time, believed to be 48, and this erroneous belief may also have biased the results obtained. Although new methods were introduced into human cytogenetics and the quality of the preparations was greatly improved, the question of aneuploidy in the endometrium has remained unanswered. In 1958, Tjio and Puck5 reported that they had found only diploid and some tetraploid cells in endometrium grown in tissue culture. Takemura6, however, found that of 109 cells only 51.4 per cent had 46 chromosomes, the chromosome counts in the others ranging from 33 to 95."

https://openalex.org/W4256642469,"I WOULD disagree with Mr. Wallace that Figs. 1a and 1b have the same perspective sense. On my view there are gradients of expansion along each of the converging lines of 1a. This expansion is due to the converging perspective of these lines, so that any feature near the middle of this figure should be, and is, expanded. This gives the outward bowing of the vertical line, since the expansion is greater where these lines are near the centre of the figure. Fig. 1b is less obvious. If the arrangement of equally spaced circles is viewed as a luminous figure, with a single eye, to prevent the competing information that it is in fact flat, it appears flat. If, however, the spacing of the circles is non-uniform, then it will be seen as a tunnel or a cone, depending on whether the spacing increases or decreases outward from the centre. In other words, the depth of the background figure depends on the spacing of the circles, not the circles themselves."
