https://openalex.org/W2620006923,"Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) frequently exhibit inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene, VHL, and often harbor multiple copy-number alterations in genes that regulate cell cycle progression. We show here that modeling these genetic alterations by combined deletion of Vhl, Trp53 and Rb1 specifically in renal epithelial cells in mice caused ccRCC. These tumors arose from proximal tubule epithelial cells and shared molecular markers and mRNA expression profiles with human ccRCC. Exome sequencing revealed that mouse and human ccRCCs exhibit recurrent mutations in genes associated with the primary cilium, uncovering a mutational convergence on this organelle and implicating a subset of ccRCCs as genetic ciliopathies. Different mouse tumors responded differently to standard therapies for advanced human ccRCC, mimicking the range of clinical behaviors in the human disease. Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α transcription factors with acriflavine as third-line therapy had therapeutic effects in some tumors, providing preclinical evidence for further investigation of HIF-α inhibition as a ccRCC treatment. This autochthonous mouse ccRCC model represents a tool to investigate the biology of ccRCC and to identify new treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2617725782,"Although antiretroviral therapy can suppress HIV-1 infection to undetectable levels of plasma viremia, integrated latent HIV-1 genomes that encode replication-competent virus persist in resting CD4+ T cells. This latent HIV-1 reservoir represents a major barrier to a cure. Currently, there are substantial efforts to identify therapeutic approaches that will eliminate or reduce the size of this latent HIV-1 reservoir. In this regard, a sensitive assay that can accurately and rapidly quantify inducible, replication-competent latent HIV-1 from resting CD4+ T cells is essential for HIV-1 eradication studies. Here we describe a reporter cell-based assay to quantify inducible, replication-competent latent HIV-1. This assay has several advantages over existing technology in that it (i) is sensitive; (ii) requires only a small blood volume; (iii) is faster, less labor intensive, and less expensive; and (iv) can be readily adapted into a high-throughput format. Using this assay, we show that the size of the inducible latent HIV-1 reservoir in aviremic participants on therapy is approximately 70-fold larger than previous estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2617249179,"Background The aim of this study was to analyze the mortality and predictors of 30-day mortality among hospitalized patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary tract infection (PAUTI) and the impact of antibiotic treatment on survival. Methods Patients admitted to our hospital with PAUTI or those diagnosed of PAUTI during hospitalization for other disease between September 2012 and September 2014 were included. Repeated episodes from the same patient were excluded. Database with demographic, clinical and laboratory ítems was created. Empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy, antimicrobial resistance and all-cause mortality at 30 and 90 days were included. Results 62 patients were included, with a mean age of 75 years. 51% were male. Mortality was 17.7% at 30 days and 33.9% at 90 days. Factors associated with reduced survival at 30 days were chronic liver disease with portal hypertension (P<0,01), diabetes mellitus (P = 0,04) chronic renal failure (P = 0,02), severe sepsis or septic shock (P<0,01), Charlson index > 3 (P = 0.02) and inadequated definitive antibiotic treatment (P<0,01). Independent risk factors for mortality in multivariate analysis were advanced chronic liver disease (HR 77,4; P<0,01), diabetes mellitus (HR 3,6; P = 0,04), chronic renal failure (HR 4,1; P = 0,03) and inadequated definitive antimicrobial treatment (HR 6,8; P = 0,01). Conclusions PAUTI are associated with high mortality in hospitalized patients, which increases significantly in those with severe comorbidity such as chronic renal failure, advanced liver disease or diabetes mellitus. Inadequated antibiotic treatment is associated with poor outcome, which remarks the importance of adjusting empirical antibiotic treatment based on the microbiological susceptibility results."
https://openalex.org/W2617302127,"Many experiments have suggested that the brain operates close to a critical state, based on signatures of criticality such as power-law distributed neuronal avalanches. In neural network models, criticality is a dynamical state that maximizes information processing capacities, e.g. sensitivity to input, dynamical range and storage capacity, which makes it a favorable candidate state for brain function. Although models that self-organize towards a critical state have been proposed, the relation between criticality signatures and learning is still unclear. Here, we investigate signatures of criticality in a self-organizing recurrent neural network (SORN). Investigating criticality in the SORN is of particular interest because it has not been developed to show criticality. Instead, the SORN has been shown to exhibit spatio-temporal pattern learning through a combination of neural plasticity mechanisms and it reproduces a number of biological findings on neural variability and the statistics and fluctuations of synaptic efficacies. We show that, after a transient, the SORN spontaneously self-organizes into a dynamical state that shows criticality signatures comparable to those found in experiments. The plasticity mechanisms are necessary to attain that dynamical state, but not to maintain it. Furthermore, onset of external input transiently changes the slope of the avalanche distributions - matching recent experimental findings. Interestingly, the membrane noise level necessary for the occurrence of the criticality signatures reduces the model's performance in simple learning tasks. Overall, our work shows that the biologically inspired plasticity and homeostasis mechanisms responsible for the SORN's spatio-temporal learning abilities can give rise to criticality signatures in its activity when driven by random input, but these break down under the structured input of short repeating sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2619818842,"Cotton is a pioneer of saline land crop, while salt stress still causes its growth inhibition and fiber production decrease. Phenotype identification showed better salt tolerance of a wild diploid cotton species Gossypium klotzschianum. To elucidate the salt-tolerant mechanisms in G. klotzschianum, we firstly detected the changes in hormones, H2O2 and glutathione (GSSH and GSH), then investigated the gene expression pattern of roots and leaves treated with 300 mM NaCl for 0, 3, 12, 48 h, and each time control by RNA-seq on the Illumina-Solexa platform. Physiological determination proved that the significant increase in hormone ABA at 48 h, while that in H2O2 was at 12 h, likewise, the GSH content decrease at 48 h and the GSSH content increase at 48 h, under salt stress. In total, 37,278 unigenes were identified from the transcriptome data, 8,312 and 6,732 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were discovered to be involved in salt stress tolerance in roots and leaves, respectively. Gene function annotation and expression analysis elucidated hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and salt overly sensitive (SOS) signal transduction related genes revealed the important roles of them in signal transmission, oxidation balance and ion homeostasis in response to salinity stress. This is a report which focuses on primary response to highly salty stress (upto 300 mM NaCl) in cotton using a wild diploid Gossypium species, broadening our understanding of the salt tolerance mechanism in cotton and laying a solid foundation of salt resistant for the genetic improvement of upland cotton with the resistance to salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W2618061473,"Meningiomas, derived from arachnoid cap cells, are the most common intracranial tumor. High-grade meningiomas, as well as those located at the skull base or near venous sinuses, frequently recur and are challenging to manage. Next-generation sequencing is identifying novel pharmacologic targets in meningiomas to complement surgery and radiation. However, due to the lack of in vitro models, the importance and implications of these genetic variants in meningioma pathogenesis and therapy remain unclear. We performed whole exome sequencing to assess single nucleotide variants and somatic copy number variants in four human meningioma cell lines, including two benign lines (HBL-52 and Ben-Men-1) and two malignant lines (IOMM-Lee and CH157-MN). The two malignant cell lines harbored an elevated rate of mutations and copy number alterations compared to the benign lines, consistent with the genetic profiles of high-grade meningiomas. In addition, these cell lines also harbored known meningioma driver mutations in neurofibromin 2 (NF2) and TNF receptor-associated factor 7 (TRAF7). These findings demonstrate the relevance of meningioma cell lines as a model system, especially as tools to investigate the signaling pathways of, and subsequent resistance to, therapeutics currently in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2617304014,"Tau protein can be released by neurons, an event linked to the propagation of Tau pathology in Alzheimer’disease (AD). Neuronal hyperexcitability was shown to significantly increase Tau release by neurons. We confirmed this in the present study. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that hyperexcitability induces Golgi apparatus dynamics resulting in its fragmentation. Our present results revealed that the increase of Tau secretion upon hyperexcitability could be significantly reduced by preventing Golgi dynamics through the inactivation of cdk5. We then verified whether a Golgi fragmentation not induced by hyperexcitability could also increase Tau secretion. The suppression of Rab1A, Rab GTPase associated with the Golgi membranes, known to induce a Golgi fragmentation increased Tau secretion by both neurons and HeLa cells. Although it remains to be demonstrated whether the Golgi is directly involved in Tau secretion, the present results demonstrate that its dynamics are correlated to a modulation of Tau secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2617127713,"Plant B-box domain proteins (BBX) mediate many light-influenced developmental processes including seedling photomorphogenesis, seed germination, shade avoidance and photoperiodic regulation of flowering. Despite the wide range of potential functions, the current knowledge regarding BBX proteins in major crop plants is scarce. In this study, we identify and characterize the StBBX gene family in potato, which is composed of 30 members, with regard to structural properties and expression profiles under diurnal cycle, etiolation and de-etiolations. Based on domain organization and phylogenetic relationships, StBBX genes have been classified into five groups. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we found that expression of most of them oscillates following a 24-h rhythm; however, large differences in expression profiles were observed between the genes regarding amplitude and position of the maximal and minimal expression levels in the day/night cycle. On the basis of the time-of-day/time-of-night, we distinguished three expression groups specifically expressed during the light and two during the dark phase. In addition, we showed that the expression of several StBBX genes is under the control of the circadian clock and that some others are specifically associated with the etiolation and de-etiolation conditions. Thus, we concluded that StBBX proteins are likely key players involved in the complex diurnal and circadian networks regulating plant development as a function of light conditions and day duration."
https://openalex.org/W2617036411,"Background Saturated fatty acids are generally thought to have detrimental effects on health. However, a recent study showed that even- and odd-chain saturated fatty acids had opposite associations with type 2 diabetes. Limited studies of Western populations examined the associations of circulating saturated fatty acids with adipokines, an important role in glucose metabolism. Objective We examined the associations of saturated fatty acids in serum phospholipids with circulating levels of adipokines among a Japanese population. Design A cross-sectional study was conducted among 484 Japanese employees (284 men and 200 women) aged 20–65 years. The serum fatty acid composition in the phospholipid fraction was measured by gas-chromatography. Serum leptin, adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), resistin, and visfatin were measured using a Luminex suspension bead-based multiplexed array. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between saturated fatty acids and adipokines, with adjustment for potential confounding variables. Results Even- and odd-chain saturated fatty acids were differentially associated with adipokines. Higher levels of even-chain saturated fatty acids (14:0 myristic, 16:0 palmitic, and 18:0 stearic acids) were associated with higher levels of resistin (P for trend = 0.048) and lower levels of adiponectin (P for trend = 0.003). By contrast, odd-chain saturated fatty acids (15:0 pentadecanoic and 17:0 heptadecanoic acids) showed inverse associations with leptin and PAI-1 (P for trend = 0.048 and 0.02, respectively). Visfatin was positively associated with both even- and odd-chain saturated fatty acids. Conclusions The results suggest that even- and odd-chain saturated fatty acids are differentially associated with adipokine profile."
https://openalex.org/W2619182789,"The genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and water stress tolerance are scarcely known. This study aimed to evaluate the main WSC in stems, and the expression of genes involved in fructan metabolism in wheat genotypes growing in a glasshouse with water stress (WS; 50% field capacity from heading) and full irrigation (FI; 100% field capacity). Eight wheat genotypes (five tolerant and three susceptible to water stress) were evaluated initially (experiment 1) and the two most contrasting genotypes in terms of WSC accumulation were evaluated in a subsequent experiment (experiment 2). Maximum accumulation of WSC occurred 10–20 days after anthesis. Under WS, the stress-tolerant genotype exhibited higher concentrations of WSC, glucose, fructose and fructan in the stems, compared to FI. In addition, the stress-tolerant genotype exhibited higher up-regulation of the fructan 1-fructosyltransferase B (1-FFTB) and fructan 1-exohydrolase w2 (1-FEHw2) genes, whereas the susceptible cultivar presented an up-regulation of the fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) and fructan 1-exohydrolase w3 (1-FEHw3) genes. Our results indicated clear differences in the pattern of WSC accumulation and the expression of genes regulating fructan metabolism between the tolerant and susceptible genotypes under WS."
https://openalex.org/W2618153392,"Elucidating the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to the hydrothermal vent in organisms at genomic level is significant for understanding the adaptive evolution process in the extreme environment. We performed RNA-seq on four different tissues of a vent crab species, Austinograea alayseae, producing 725,461 unigenes and 134,489 annotated genes. Genes related to sensory, circadian rhythm, hormone, hypoxia stress, metal detoxification and immunity were identified. It was noted that in the degenerated eyestalk, transcription of phototransduction related genes which are important for retinal function was greatly reduced; three crucial neuropeptide hormones, one molt-inhibiting and two crustacean hyperglycemic hormone precursors were characterized with conserved domains; hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and two novel isoforms of metallothioneins in the vent crabs were discovered. An analysis of 6,932 orthologs among three crabs A. alayseae, Portunus trituberculutus and Eriocheir sinensis revealed 19 positive selected genes (PSGs). Most of the PSGs were involved in immune responses, such as crustins and anti-lipopolysaccharide factor, suggesting their function in the adaptation to environment. The characterization of the first vent crab transcriptome provides abundant resources for genetic and evolutionary studies of this species, and paves the way for further investigation of vent adaptation process in crabs."
https://openalex.org/W2618278489,"The role played by river networks in regional and global carbon cycle is receiving increasing attention. Despite the potential of radiocarbon measurements (14C) to elucidate sources and cycling of different riverine carbon pools, there remain large regions such as the climate-sensitive Tibetan Plateau for which no data are available. Here we provide new 14C data on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from three large Asian rivers (the Yellow, Yangtze and Yarlung Tsangpo Rivers) running on the Tibetan Plateau and present the carbon transportation pattern in rivers of the plateau versus other river system in the world. Despite higher discharge rates during the high flow season, the DOC yield of Tibetan Plateau rivers (0.41 gC m-2 yr-1) was lower than most other rivers due to lower concentrations. Radiocarbon ages of the DOC were older/more depleted (511±294 years before present, yr BP) in the Tibetan rivers than those in Arctic and tropical rivers. A positive correlation between radiocarbon age and permafrost watershed coverage was observed, indicating that 14C-deplted/old carbon is exported from permafrost regions of the Tibetan Plateau during periods of high flow. This is in sharp contrast to permafrost regions of the Arctic which export 14C-enriched carbon during high discharge periods."
https://openalex.org/W2618872880,"Background The microRNA-200 (miR-200) family acts as a major suppressor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Impaired miR-200 expression may lead to EMT initiation and eventually cancer dissemination. The presence of tumor budding cells (TBC) is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis, and molecular similarities to EMT indicate that these cells may reflect ongoing EMT. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of miR-200b in budding cells of colon cancer and the relationship with the EMT-markers E-cadherin, β-catenin and laminin-5γ2. Material & methods MiR-200b was investigated by in situ hybridization in 58 cases of stage II (n = 36) and III colon (n = 22) cancers with tumor budding. Expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin and laminin-5γ2 was examined by immunohistochemistry. A multiplex fluorescence assay combining miR-200b with cytokeratin and laminin-5γ2 was employed on a subset of 16 samples. Results MiR-200b was downregulated in the TBC at the invasive front of 41 out of 58 (71%) cases. The decline was present in both mismatch satellite stable and instable adenocarcinomas. The majority of cases also showed loss of membranous E-cadherin and increased nuclear β-catenin in the TBC, while laminin-5γ2 expression was upregulated at the invasive front and in the tumor buds of approximately half the adenocarcinomas. However, the miR-200b decline was not statistically associated with the expression of any of the EMT-markers. The miR-200b decline was also documented by multiplex fluorescence. Fourteen out of fifteen cases showed a decrease in miR-200b expression in the majority of the TBC, but no obvious relationship between miR-200b and laminin-5γ2 expression was observed. Conclusion: The findings support the assumption of a miR-200b related downregulation in colon cancer budding cells. Whether miR-200b expression may be of clinical significance awaits further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2617975382,"Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) integration and modelling were used to predict dosage schedules for florfenicol for two pig pneumonia pathogens, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida. Pharmacokinetic data were pooled for two bioequivalent products, pioneer and generic formulations, administered intramuscularly to pigs at a dose rate of 15 mg/kg. Antibacterial potency was determined in vitro as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Mutant Prevention Concentration in broth and pig serum, for six isolates of each organism. For both organisms and for both serum and broth MICs, average concentration:MIC ratios over 48 h were similar and exceeded 2.5:1 and times greater than MIC exceeded 35 h. From in vitro time-kill curves, PK/PD modelling established serum breakpoint values for the index AUC24h/MIC for three levels of inhibition of growth, bacteriostasis and 3 and 4log10 reductions in bacterial count; means were 25.7, 40.2 and 47.0 h, respectively, for P. multocida and 24.6, 43.8 and 58.6 h for A. pleuropneumoniae. Using these PK and PD data, together with literature MIC distributions, doses for each pathogen were predicted for: (1) bacteriostatic and bactericidal levels of kill; (2) for 50 and 90% target attainment rates (TAR); and (3) for single dosing and daily dosing at steady state. Monte Carlo simulations for 90% TAR predicted single doses to achieve bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions over 48 h of 14.4 and 22.2 mg/kg (P. multocida) and 44.7 and 86.6 mg/kg (A. pleuropneumoniae). For daily doses at steady state, and 90% TAR bacteriostatic and bactericidal actions, dosages of 6.2 and 9.6 mg/kg (P. multocida) and 18.2 and 35.2 mg/kg (A. pleuropneumoniae) were required. PK/PD integration and modelling approaches to dose determination indicate the possibility of tailoring dose to a range of end-points."
https://openalex.org/W2618330648,"Mushrooms have been prized by humankind as medicine and culinary wonder since antiquity. Though several species are ethnically valued; many prospective species are still being discovered. One such wild macrofungus has recently been discovered during subsequent field surveys in West Bengal, India which in turn exposed as a traditionally consumed popular myco-food. The collected taxon was found to be unique with regard to its morphological as well as genetical features. After detailed characterizations, the fungus was identified as a novel taxon belonging to the genus Russula (Russulaceae, Basidiomycota). Besides, the investigation was further extended in search of new functional ingredients and in this context, a water soluble crude polysaccharide rich extract (Rusalan) was isolated from dried basidiocarps. Accumulating evidences from GC-MS, HPTLC, FT-IR along with several spectrophotometric methods postulated that the fraction consisted mainly of carbohydrate in triple helical conformation, where glucose was the major monosaccharide mostly with β-type glycosidic linkage. Conversely, Rusalan showed pronounced antioxidant activity in six in vitro assay systems with EC50 value ranging from 190-1328 μg/ml concentration. The crude polysaccharide was also evaluated against six bacterial strains using microdilution method and the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were found to be inhibited effectively. In addition, immune-stimulatory assays demonstrated that Rusalan could evidently promote proliferation, induce phagocytosis, release NO, produce intracellular ROS and upregulate mRNA expression of iNOS, TNF-α, COX-2, as well as IL-6 genes in in mouse macrophage cells. Therefore, aim of the present study was not only to describe a new taxon to the world mycoflora but also to introduce a potent therapeutic agent that could be explored for food and pharmaceutical purposes. However, isolation of active component and in vivo studies need to be designed further."
https://openalex.org/W2619604377,"Cell penetrating peptides have long held great potential for delivery of biomolecular cargos for research, therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. They allow rapid, relatively nontoxic passage of a wide variety of biomolecules through the plasma membranes of living cells. However, CPP-based research tools and therapeutics have been stymied by poor efficiency in release from endosomes and a great deal of effort has been made to solve this 'endosomal escape problem.' Previously, we showed that use of a reversible, noncovalent coupling between CPP and cargo using calmodulin and a calmodulin binding motif allowed efficient delivery of cargo proteins to the cytoplasm in baby hamster kidney and other mammalian cell lines. The present report demonstrates the efficacy of our CPP-adaptor scheme for efficient delivery of model cargos to the cytoplasm using a variety of CPPs and adaptors. Effective overcoming of the endosomal escape problem is further demonstrated by the delivery of cargo to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes by addition of appropriate subcellular localization signals to the cargos. CPP-adaptors were also used to deliver cargo to myotubes, demonstrating the feasibility of the system as an alternative to transfection for the manipulation of hard-to-transfect cells."
https://openalex.org/W2616910152,"Background Rhinovirus (HRV) is associated with the large majority of virus-induced asthma exacerbations in children and young adults, but the mechanisms remain poorly defined. Methods Asthmatics and non-asthmatic controls were inoculated with HRV-A16, and nasal epithelial samples were obtained 7 days before, 36 hours after, and 7 days after viral inoculation. RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. Results At baseline, 57 genes were differentially expressed between asthmatics and controls, and the asthmatics had decreased expression of viral replication inhibitors and increased expression of genes involved in inflammation. At 36 hours (before the emergence of peak symptoms), 1329 genes were significantly altered from baseline in the asthmatics compared to 62 genes in the controls. At this time point, asthmatics lacked an increase in IL-10 signaling observed in the controls. At 7 days following HRV inoculation, 222 genes were significantly dysregulated in the asthmatics, whereas only 4 genes were dysregulated among controls. At this time point, the controls but not asthmatics demonstrated upregulation of SPINK5. Conclusions As judged by the magnitude and persistence of dysregulated genes, asthmatics have a substantially different host response to HRV-A16 infection compared with non-asthmatic controls. Gene expression differences illuminate biologically plausible mechanisms that contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HRV-induced asthma exacerbations."
https://openalex.org/W2616906482,"Concurrent EEG and fMRI is increasingly used to characterize the spatial-temporal dynamics of brain activity. However, most studies to date have been limited to conventional echo-planar imaging (EPI). There is considerable interest in integrating recently developed high-speed fMRI methods with high-density EEG to increase temporal resolution and sensitivity for task-based and resting state fMRI, and for detecting interictal spikes in epilepsy. In the present study using concurrent high-density EEG and recently developed high-speed fMRI methods, we investigate safety of radiofrequency (RF) related heating, the effect of EEG on cortical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fMRI, and assess EEG data quality.The study compared EPI, multi-echo EPI, multi-band EPI and multi-slab echo-volumar imaging pulse sequences, using clinical 3 Tesla MR scanners from two different vendors that were equipped with 64- and 256-channel MR-compatible EEG systems, respectively, and receive only array head coils. Data were collected in 11 healthy controls (3 males, age range 18-70 years) and 13 patients with epilepsy (8 males, age range 21-67 years). Three of the healthy controls were scanned with the 256-channel EEG system, the other subjects were scanned with the 64-channel EEG system. Scalp surface temperature, SNR in occipital cortex and head movement were measured with and without the EEG cap. The degree of artifacts and the ability to identify background activity was assessed by visual analysis by a trained expert in the 64 channel EEG data (7 healthy controls, 13 patients).RF induced heating at the surface of the EEG electrodes during a 30-minute scan period with stable temperature prior to scanning did not exceed 1.0° C with either EEG system and any of the pulse sequences used in this study. There was no significant decrease in cortical SNR due to the presence of the EEG cap (p > 0.05). No significant differences in the visually analyzed EEG data quality were found between EEG recorded during high-speed fMRI and during conventional EPI (p = 0.78). Residual ballistocardiographic artifacts resulted in 58% of EEG data being rated as poor quality.This study demonstrates that high-density EEG can be safely implemented in conjunction with high-speed fMRI and that high-speed fMRI does not adversely affect EEG data quality. However, the deterioration of the EEG quality due to residual ballistocardiographic artifacts remains a significant constraint for routine clinical applications of concurrent EEG-fMRI."
https://openalex.org/W2617818508,"Sub-Saharan agriculture has been identified as vulnerable to ongoing climate change. Adaptation of agriculture has been suggested as a way to maintain productivity. Better knowledge of intra-specific diversity of varieties is prerequisites for the successful management of such adaptation. Among crops, root and tubers play important roles in food security and economic growth for the most vulnerable populations in Africa. Here, we focus on the sweet potato. The Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) was domesticated in Central and South America and was later introduced into Africa and is now cultivated throughout tropical Africa. We evaluated its diversity in West Africa by sampling a region extending from the coastal area of Togo to the northern Sahelian region of Senegal that represents a range of climatic conditions. Using 12 microsatellite markers, we evaluated 132 varieties along this gradient. Phenotypic data from field trials conducted in three seasons was also obtained. Genetic diversity in West Africa was found to be 18% lower than in America. Genetic diversity in West Africa is structured into five groups, with some groups found in very specific climatic areas, e.g. under a tropical humid climate, or under a Sahelian climate. We also observed genetic groups that occur in a wider range of climates. The genetic groups were also associated with morphological differentiation, mainly the shape of the leaves and the color of the stem or root. This particular structure of diversity along a climatic gradient with association to phenotypic variability can be used for conservation strategies. If such structure is proved to be associated with specific climatic adaptation, it will also allow developing strategies to adapt agriculture to ongoing climate variation in West Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2618701102,"Stroke is a devastating and potentially preventable complication of cardiac surgery. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a commonly antifibrinolytic agent in cardiac surgeries with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), however, there is concern that it might increase incidence of stroke after cardiac surgery. In this retrospective study, we investigated whether TXA usage could increase postoperative stroke in cardiac surgery.A retrospective study was conducted from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015, in 2,016 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 664 patients received intravenous TXA infusion and 1,352 patients did not receive any antifibrinolytic agent. Univariate and propensity-weighted multivariate regression analysis were applied for data analysis.Intraoperative TXA administration was associated with postoperative stroke (1.7% vs. 0.5%; adjusted OR, 4.11; 95% CI, 1.33 to 12.71; p = 0.014) and coma (adjusted OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.06 to 7.26; p = 0.038) in cardiac surgery. As subtype analysis was performed, TXA administration was still associated with postoperative stroke (1.7% vs. 0.3%; adjusted OR, 5.78; 95% CI, 1.34 to 27.89; p = 0.018) in patients undergoing valve surgery or multi-valve surgery only, but was not associated with postoperative stroke (1.7% vs. 1.3%; adjusted OR, 5.21; 95% CI, 0.27 to 101.17; p = 0.276) in patients undergoing CABG surgery only. However, TXA administration was not associated with postoperative mortality (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.56 to 3.71; p = 0.451), seizure (adjusted OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.42 to 3.04; p = 0.816), continuous renal replacement therapy (adjusted OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.56 to 3.28; p = 0.495) and resternotomy for postoperative bleeding (adjusted OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.55 to 4.30; p = 0.405). No difference was found in postoperative ventilation time (adjusted B, -1.45; SE, 2.33; p = 0.535), length of intensive care unit stay (adjusted B, -0.12; SE, 0.25; p = 0.633) and length of hospital stay (adjusted B, 0.48; SE, 0.58; p = 0.408).Based on the 5-year experience of TXA administration in cardiac surgery with CPB, we found that postoperative stroke was associated with intraoperative TXA administration in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, especially in those undergoing valve surgeries only. This study may suggest that TXA should be administrated according to clear indications after evaluating the bleeding risk in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, especially in those with high stroke risk."
https://openalex.org/W2616960600,"Apoptosis plays a central role in developmental and pathological angiogenesis and vessel regression. Bim is a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that plays a prominent role in both developmental and pathological ocular vessel regression, and neovascularization. Endothelial cells (EC) and pericytes (PC) each play unique roles during vascular development, maintenance and regression. We recently showed that germline deletion of Bim results in persistent hyaloid vasculature, increased retinal vascular density and prevents retinal vessel regression in response to hyperoxia. To determine whether retinal vascular regression is attributable to Bim expression in EC or PC we generated mice carrying a conditional Bim allele (BimFlox/Flox) and VE-cadherin-cre (BimEC mice) or Pdgfrb-cre (BimPC mice). BimEC and BimPC mice demonstrated attenuated hyaloid vessel regression and postnatal retinal vascular remodeling. We also observed decreased retinal vascular apoptosis and proliferation. Unlike global Bim -/- mice, mice conditionally lacking Bim in EC or PC underwent hyperoxia-mediated vessel obliteration and subsequent retinal neovascularization during oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy similar to control littermates. Thus, understanding the cell autonomous role Bim plays in the retinal vascular homeostasis will give us new insight into how to modulate pathological retinal neovascularization and vessel regression to preserve vision."
https://openalex.org/W2617533773,"The Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been a key resource for learning general rules of sequence-structure relationships in proteins. Quantitative insights have been gained by defining geometric descriptors of structure (e.g., distances, dihedral angles, solvent exposure, etc.) and observing their distributions and sequence preferences. Here we argue that as the PDB continues to grow, it may become unnecessary to reduce structure into a set of elementary descriptors. Instead, it could be possible to deduce quantitative sequence-structure relationships in the context of precisely-defined complex structural motifs by mining the PDB for closely matching backbone geometries. To validate this idea, we turned to the the task of predicting changes in protein stability upon amino-acid substitution-a difficult problem of broad significance. We defined non-contiguous tertiary motifs (TERMs) around a protein site of interest and extracted sequence preferences from ensembles of closely-matching substructures in the PDB to predict mutational stability changes at the site, ΔΔGm. We demonstrate that these ensemble statistics predict ΔΔGm on par with state-of-the-art statistical and machine-learning methods on large thermodynamic datasets, and outperform these, along with a leading structure-based modeling approach, when tested in the context of unbiased diverse mutations. Further, we show that the performance of the TERM-based method is directly related to the amount of available relevant structural data, automatically improving with the growing PDB. This enables a means of estimating prediction accuracy. Our results clearly demonstrate that: 1) statistics of non-contiguous structural motifs in the PDB encode fundamental sequence-structure relationships related to protein thermodynamic stability, and 2) the PDB is now large enough that such statistics are already useful in practice, with their accuracy expected to continue increasing as the database grows. These observations suggest new ways of using structural data towards addressing problems of computational structural biology."
https://openalex.org/W2618090322,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis characterized by human mesangial cells (HMC) proliferation and extracellular matrix expansion associated with immune deposits consisting of galactose-deficient IgA1. However, how IgA1 contributes to IgAN has yet to be completely elucidated. In this study, the expression profile of chemokines was more altered in IgA1-treated HMC than in the control group. CCL20 was significantly higher either in the serum of IgAN patients or in IgA1-treated HMC. Further experiments demonstrated that CCR6, the only receptor of CCL20, was highly expressed in activated T cells. Intracellular staining assay and cytokine expression profile implied that CCR6+ T cells produced high IL-17 levels. Transwell experiment immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence experiments extensively demonstrated that CCL20 could recruit inflammatory Th17 cells to the kidneys. These phenomena caused a series of immune inflammatory responses and further damaged the kidneys. Therefore, HMC stimulated by IgA1 could produce CCL20 and consequently recruit inflammatory Th17 cells to the kidneys to induce further lesion in IgA nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2618851593,"Poor childhood family conditions have a long-term effect on adult mental health, but the mechanisms behind this association are unclear. Our aim was to study the pathways from problematic family relationships in adolescence to midlife psychological distress via disadvantages in early adulthood. Participants of a Finnish cohort study at the age of 16 years old in 1983 were followed up at ages 22, 32 and 42 years old (N = 1334). Problems in family relationships were measured with poor relationship with mother and father, lack of parental support in adolescent’s individuation process and poor home atmosphere, and mental health was assessed using Kessler’s Psychological Distress Scale (K10). We analyzed the indirect effects of adolescent family relations on mental health at age 42 years old via various disadvantages (somatic and psychological symptoms, relationship/marital status, low education/unemployment and heavy drinking) at ages 22 and 32 years old. Problematic adolescent family relationships were associated with midlife psychological distress in women (0.19; 95% CI 0.11, 0.26) and men (0.13; 95% CI 0.04, 0.21). However, after adjustment for adolescent psychological symptoms, the association was only significant for women (0.12; 95% CI 0.04, 0.20). Poor family relationships were associated with various disadvantages in early adulthood. The association from poor family relationships (16 years old) to psychological distress (42 years old) was in part mediated via psychological symptoms in women (0.03; 95% CI 0.01, 0.04) and men (0.02; 95% CI 0.00, 0.04) and in women also via heavy drinking in early adulthood (0.02; 95% CI 0.00, 0.03). Adolescent family relationships have a role in determining adult mental health. Targeted support addressing psychological well-being and hazardous drinking for adolescents with problematic family relationships might prevent disadvantages in early adulthood, and further prevent poor midlife mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2617745334,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a systematic autoimmune disease with evidence of genetic predisposition. The IKZF1 (IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (Ikaros)) gene is located at 7p12.2, encodes a transcription factor related to chromatin remodeling, regulates lymphocyte differentiation, and has been reported to be associated with some autoimmune diseases. However, there have been no reports of an association between IKZF1 and pSS. To investigate the possibility of an association between the IKZF1 locus and pSS, we selected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IKZF1 locus, rs4917129 and rs4917014, based on a detailed analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and performed genotyping in 665 Han Chinese pSS patients and 863 healthy controls. The results of an association test showed significant association signals (rs4917129: P-value = 5.5e-4, OR (odds ratio) = 0.72, 95% CI (confidence interval) = 0.60–0.87; rs4917014: P-value = 1.2e-3, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.64–0.89). A meta-analysis that combined the above results with data from previous GWAS, further confirmed these associations (rs4917129: Pmeta = 4.24e-8, ORmeta = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.61–0.79; rs4917014: Pmeta = 6.0e-8, ORmeta = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.64–0.81). A bioinformatics analysis indicated that both SNPs were located in a putative enhancer area in immune-related cell lines and tissues. A protein-protein interaction analysis found that IKZF1, together with GTF2I (an SS susceptibility gene newly identified through GWAS), could interact with histone deacetylase family proteins. In summary, this is the first study to report an association between IKZF1 and SS in Han Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2618863866,"Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly infectious disease that affects cloven-hoofed livestock and wildlife. FMD has been a problem for decades, which has led to various measures to control, eradicate and prevent FMD by National Veterinary Services worldwide. Currently, the identification of areas that are at risk of FMD virus incursion and spread is a priority for FMD target surveillance after FMD is eradicated from a given country or region. In our study, a knowledge-driven spatial model was built to identify risk areas for FMD occurrence and to evaluate FMD surveillance performance in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. For this purpose, multi-criteria decision analysis was used as a tool to seek multiple and conflicting criteria to determine a preferred course of action. Thirteen South American experts analyzed 18 variables associated with FMD introduction and dissemination pathways in Rio Grande do Sul. As a result, FMD higher risk areas were identified at international borders and in the central region of the state. The final model was expressed as a raster surface. The predictive ability of the model assessed by comparing, for each cell of the raster surface, the computed model risk scores with a binary variable representing the presence or absence of an FMD outbreak in that cell during the period 1985 to 2015. Current FMD surveillance performance was assessed, and recommendations were made to improve surveillance activities in critical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2619761116,"Twenty to thirty percent of patients undergoing cardiac surgery develop acute kidney injury (AKI). In mice, inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) attenuates renal injury following ischemia-reperfusion. We tested the hypothesis that functional variants of EPHX2, encoding sEH, are associated with AKI after cardiac surgery. We genotyped patients in two independent cardiac surgery cohorts for functional EPHX2 polymorphisms, Lys55Arg and Arg287Gln, and determined AKI using Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. The 287Gln variant was not associated with AKI. In the discovery cohort, the gain-of-function 55Arg variant was associated with an increased incidence of AKI in univariate (p = 0.03) and multivariable (p = 0.04) analyses. In white patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 55Arg variant was independently associated with AKI with an OR of 2.04 (95% CI 0.95–4.42) for 55Arg heterozygotes and 31.53 (1.57–633.19) for homozygotes (p = 0.02), after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, and use of cardiopulmonary bypass. These findings were replicated in the second cardiac surgery cohort. 12,13- and total- dihydroxyoctadecanoic acids (DiHOME): epoxyoctadecanoic acids (EpOME) ratios were increased in EPHX2 55Arg variant carriers, consistent with increased hydrolase activity. The EPHX2 Lys55Arg polymorphism is associated with AKI following cardiac surgery in patients without preexisting CKD. Pharmacological strategies to decrease sEH activity might decrease postoperative AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2618239207,"Objective Contemporary approaches to medical decision-making advise that clinicians should respect patients’ decisions. However, patients’ decisions are often shaped by heuristics, such as being guided by emotion, rather than by objective risk and benefit. Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) decisions focus this dilemma sharply. RRM reduces breast cancer (BC) risk, but is invasive and can have iatrogenic consequences. Previous evidence suggests that emotion guides patients’ decision-making about RRM. We interviewed patients to better understand how they made decisions about RRM, using findings to consider how clinicians could ethically respond to their decisions. Methods Qualitative face-to-face interviews with 34 patients listed for RRM surgery and two who had decided against RRM. Results Patients generally did not use objective risk estimates or, indeed, consider risks and benefits of RRM. Instead emotions guided their decisions: they chose RRM because they feared BC and wanted to do ‘all they could’ to prevent it. Most therefore perceived RRM to be the ‘obvious’ option and made the decision easily. However, many recounted extensive post-decisional deliberation, generally directed towards justifying the original decision. A few patients deliberated before the decision because fears of surgery counterbalanced those of BC. Conclusion Patients seeking RRM were motivated by fear of BC, and the need to avoid potential regret for not doing all they could to prevent it. We suggest that choices such as that for RRM, which are made emotionally, can be respected as autonomous decisions, provided patients have considered risks and benefits. Drawing on psychological theory about how people do make decisions, as well as normative views of how they should, we propose that practitioners can guide consideration of risks and benefits even, where necessary, after patients have opted for surgery. This model of practice could be extended to other medical decisions that are influenced by patients’ emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2618390429,"Although financial decisions are expected to be rational, there is a growing body of experimental research indicating that small psychological changes in one's mind-set in the actual decision-making moment might affect saving ratios. In this article, another type of change in one's mind-set, which can influence saving decisions, is explored, namely the level of construal. Construal level is a key descriptor of people's cognitive representations of targets, and is a way of characterising the mental mind-sets people use. Building on recent advances in the link between construal levels and intertemporal choices, the present research evaluates the effect of shifts in levels of construal in the very moment of decision making on people's propensity to save money. It is suggested that triggering a high-level construal mind-set would influence individuals' financial decisions and result in greater willingness to save than triggering a low-level construal mind-set. This assumption is supported by the findings: across three experiments, those with an abstract mind-set showed an increased willingness to save when compared to those with a concrete mind-set. The first experiment demonstrated that people in an abstract mind-set are more willing to delay financial gratification than those in a concrete mind-set. In the second and third experiments, those with an abstract mind-set showed an increased willingness to save when compared to those with a concrete mind-set. The research provides further evidence that mental states, which can be evoked by previous, unrelated tasks, such as level of cognitive abstraction, can influence everyday financial decisions. It, thus, highlights the role of situational factors that consumers may be not aware of, which still affect their savings decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2619043654,"The distribution of flowering across the growing season is governed by each species' evolutionary history and climatic variability. However, global change factors, such as eutrophication and invasion, can alter plant community composition and thus change the distribution of flowering across the growing season. We examined three ecoregions (tall-, mixed, and short-grass prairie) across the U.S. Central Plains to determine how nutrient (nitrogen (N), phosphorus, and potassium (+micronutrient)) addition alters the temporal patterns of plant flowering traits. We calculated total community flowering potential (FP) by distributing peak-season plant cover values across the growing season, allocating each species' cover to only those months in which it typically flowers. We also generated separate FP profiles for exotic and native species and functional group. We compared the ability of the added nutrients to shift the distribution of these FP profiles (total and sub-groups) across the growing season. In all ecoregions, N increased the relative cover of both exotic species and C3 graminoids that flower in May through August. The cover of C4 graminoids decreased with added N, but the response varied by ecoregion and month. However, these functional changes only aggregated to shift the entire community's FP profile in the tall-grass prairie, where the relative cover of plants expected to flower in May and June increased and those that flower in September and October decreased with added N. The relatively low native cover in May and June may leave this ecoregion vulnerable to disturbance-induced invasion by exotic species that occupy this temporal niche. There was no change in the FP profile of the mixed and short-grass prairies with N addition as increased abundance of exotic species and C3 graminoids replaced other species that flower at the same time. In these communities a disturbance other than nutrient addition may be required to disrupt phenological patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2618063610,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and its progression are major health problems that many countries including Saudi Arabia are facing. Determination of HCV genotypes and subgenotypes is critical for epidemiological and clinical analysis and aids in the determination of the ideal treatment strategy that needs to be followed and the expected therapy response. Although HCV infection has been identified as the second most predominant type of hepatitis in Saudi Arabia, little is known about the molecular epidemiology and genetic variability of HCV circulating in the Jeddah province of Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study was to determine the dominance of various HCV genotypes and subgenotypes circulating in Jeddah using partial sequencing of the NS5B region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind in Saudi Arabia. To characterize HCV genotypes and subgenotypes, serum samples from 56 patients with chronic HCV infection were collected and subjected to partial NS5B gene amplification and sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the NS5B partial sequences revealed that HCV/1 was the predominant genotype (73%), followed by HCV/4 (24.49%) and HCV/3 (2.04%). Moreover, pairwise analysis also confirmed these results based on the average specific nucleotide distance identity: ±0.112, ±0.112, and ±0.179 for HCV/1, HCV/4, and HCV/3, respectively, without any interference between genotypes. Notably, the phylogenetic tree of the HCV/1 subgenotypes revealed that all the isolates (100%) from the present study belonged to the HCV/1a subgenotype. Our findings also revealed similarities in the nucleotide sequences between HCV circulating in Saudi Arabia and those circulating in countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Canada, India, Pakistan, and France. These results indicated that determination of HCV genotypes and subgenotypes based on partial sequence analysis of the NS5B region is accurate and reliable for HCV subtype determination."
https://openalex.org/W2619834105,"Understanding the response of biomass allocation in twigs (the terminal branches of current-year shoots) to environmental change is crucial for elucidating forest ecosystem carbon storage, carbon cycling, and plant life history strategies under a changing climate. On the basis of interspecies investigations of broad-leaved plants, previous studies have demonstrated that plants respond to environmental factors by allocating biomass in an allometric manner between support tissues (i.e., stems) and the leaf biomass of twigs, where the scaling exponent (i.e., slope of a log-log linear relationship, α) is constant, and the scaling constant (i.e., intercept of a log-log linear relationship, log β) varies with respect to environmental factors. However, little is known about whether the isometric scaling exponents of such biomass allocations remain invariant for single species, particularly conifers, at different altitudes and in different growing periods. In this study, we investigated how twig biomass allocation varies with elevation and period among Pinus hwangshanensis Hsia trees growing in the mountains of Southeast China. Specifically, we explored how twig stem mass, needle mass, and needle area varied throughout the growing period (early, mid-, late) and at three elevations in the Wuyi Mountains. Standardized major axis analysis was used to compare the scaling exponents and scaling constants between the biomass allocations of within-twig components. Scaling relationships between these traits differed with growing period and altitude gradient. During the different growing periods, there was an isometric scaling relationship, with a common slope of 1.0 (i.e., α ≈ 1.0), between needle mass and twig mass (the sum of the total needle mass and the stem mass), whereas there were allometric scaling relationships between the stem mass and twig mass and between the needle mass and stem mass of P. hwangshanensis. The scaling constants (log β) for needle mass vs. twig mass and for needle mass vs. stem mass increased progressively across the growing stages, whereas the scaling constants of stem mass vs. twig mass showed the opposite pattern. The scaling exponents (α) of needle area with respect to needle biomass increased significantly with growing period, changing from an allometric relationship (i.e., α < 1.0) during the early growing period to a nearly isometric relationship (i.e., α ≈ 1.0) during the late growing period. This change possibly reflects the functional adaptation of twigs in different growing periods to meet their specific reproductive or survival needs. At different points along the altitudinal gradient, the relationships among needle mass, twig mass, and stem mass were all isometric (i.e., α ≈ 1.0). Moreover, significant differences were found in scaling constants (log β) along the altitudinal gradient, such that species had a smaller stem biomass but a relatively larger needle mass at low altitude. In addition, the scaling exponents remained numerically invariant among all three altitudes, with a common slope of 0.8, suggesting that needle area failed to keep pace with the increasing needle mass at different altitudes. Our results indicated that the twig biomass allocation pattern was significantly influenced by altitude and growing period, which reflects the functional adaptation of twigs to meet their specific survival needs under different climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2617487081,"The use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer and glyphosate-based herbicides is increasing worldwide, with agriculture holding the largest market share. The agronomic and socioeconomic utilities of glyphosate are well established; however, our knowledge of the potential effects of glyphosate applied in the presence or absence of long-term N fertilization on microbial functional activities and the availability of soil nutrients remains limited. Using an ex situ approach with soils that did (N+) or did not (N0) receive synthetic N fertilization for 6 years, we assessed the impact of different rates (no glyphosate, CK; field rate, FR; 100 × field rate, 100FR) of glyphosate application on biological and chemical parameters. We observed that, after immediate application (1 day), the highest dose of glyphosate (100FR) negatively affected the alkaline phosphatase (AlP) activity in soils without N fertilization history and decreased the cation exchange capacity (CEC) in N0 compared to CK and FR treatments with N+. Conversely, the 100FR application increased nitrate (NO3-) and available phosphorus (PO43-) regardless of N fertilization history. Then, after 8 and 15 days, the N+\100FR and N+\FR treatments exhibited the lowest values for dehydrogenase (DH) and AlP activities, respectively, while urease (URE) activity was mainly affected by N fertilization. After 15 days and irrespective of N fertilization history, the FR glyphosate application negatively affected the degradation of carbon substrates by microbial communities (expressed as the average well color development, AWCD). By contrast, the 100FR treatment positively affected AWCD, increasing PO43- by 5 and 16% and NO3- by 126 and 119% in the N+ and N0 treatments, respectively. In addition, the 100FR treatment resulted in an increase in the average net nitrification rate. Principal component analysis revealed that the 100FR glyphosate treatment selected microbial communities that were able to metabolize amine substrates. Overall, the lack of N fertilization in the 6 past years combined with the highest glyphosate application rate (100FR) induced the highest values of AWCD, functional diversity, NO3-, PO43- and nitrification. We concluded that the intensive use of N fertilization for 6 years may change the non-target effects of glyphosate application on enzyme activities. The functional activities, nitrification and nutrient contents were increased by glyphosate only when applied at 100 times the field application rate."
https://openalex.org/W2619790524,"Plant-plant interactions that change along environmental gradients can be affected by different combinations of environmental characteristics, such as the species and planting density ratios. Suaeda salsa and Scirpus planiculumis are regionally dominant species in the Shuangtai estuarine wetland. Compared with non-clonal S. salsa, clonal S. planiculumis has competitive advantages because of its morphological plasticity. However, salt-tolerant S. salsa may grow faster than S. planiculumis in saline-alkali estuary soil. Whether the interactions between these two species along salinity gradients are affected by the level of salt stress and mixed planting density ratio remains unclear. Thus, to test the effects of salt stress and planting density ratios on the interactions between S. planiculumis and S. salsa in the late growing season, we conducted a greenhouse experiment consisting of 3 salinity levels (0, 8 and 15ppt) and 5 planting density ratios. Our results showed that the promotion of S. salsa growth and inhibition of S. planiculumis growth at low salinity levels (8 ppt) did not alter the interactions between the two species. Facilitation of S. salsa occurred at high salinity levels, and the magnitude of this net outcome decreased with increases in the proportion of S. salsa. These results suggest that competition and facilitation processes not only depend on the combinations of different life-history characteristics of species but also on the planting density ratio. These findings may contribute to the understanding of the responses of estuarine wetland plant-plant interactions to human modifications of estuarine salinity."
https://openalex.org/W2617167055,"Understanding the molecular mechanism of antibiotics that are currently in use is important for the development of new antimicrobials. The tetracyclines, discovered in the 1940s, are a well-established class of antibiotics that still have a role in treating microbial infections in humans. It is generally accepted that the main target of their action is the ribosome. The estimated affinity for tetracycline binding to the ribosome is relatively low compared to the actual potency of the drug in vivo. Therefore, additional inhibitory effects of tetracycline on the translation machinery have been discussed. Structural evidence suggests that tetracycline inhibits the function of the essential bacterial GTPase Elongation Factor (EF)-Tu through interaction with the bound nucleotide. Based on this, tetracycline has been predicted to impede the nucleotide-binding properties of EF-Tu. However, detailed kinetic studies addressing the effect of tetracycline on nucleotide binding have been prevented by the fluorescence properties of the antibiotic. Here, we report a fluorescence-based kinetic assay that minimizes the effect of tetracycline autofluorescence, enabling the detailed kinetic analysis of the nucleotide-binding properties of Escherichia coli EF-Tu. Furthermore, using physiologically relevant conditions, we demonstrate that tetracycline does not affect EF-Tu’s intrinsic or ribosome-stimulated GTPase activity, nor the stability of the EF-Tu•GTP•Phe-tRNAPhe complex. We therefore provide clear evidence that tetracycline does not directly impede the function of EF-Tu."

However, quantifications of both binding complex structures and dynamical mechanisms are still challenging for IDP. In this study, we have investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of the chaperone Chz1 and histone H2A.Z-H2B association by equilibrium and kinetic stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. The dependence of free energy and kinetic rate constant on electrolyte mean activity coefficient and urea concentration are uncovered. Our results indicate a previous unseen binding kinetic intermediate. An initial conformation selection step of Chz1 is also revealed before the formation of this intermediate state. Based on these observations, a mixed mechanism of three steps including both conformation selection and induced fit is proposed. By combination of the ion- and denaturant-induced experiments, we demonstrate that electrostatic forces play a dominant role in the recognition of bipolar charged intrinsically disordered protein Chz1 to its preferred partner H2A.Z-H2B. Both the intra-chain and inter-chain electrostatic interactions have direct impacts on the native collapsed structure and binding mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2618705228,"The innate immune response to lipopolysaccharide contributes substantially to the morbidity and mortality of gram-negative sepsis. Horses and humans share an exquisite sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide and thus the horse may provide valuable comparative insights into this aspect of the inflammatory response. MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNA molecules acting as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, have key roles in toll-like receptor signaling regulation but have not been studied in this context in horses. The central hypothesis of this study was that lipopolysaccharide induces differential microRNA expression in equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a manner comparable to humans. Illumina Next Generation Sequencing was used to characterize the basal microRNA transcriptome in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy adult horses, and to evaluate LPS-induced changes in microRNA expression in cells cultured for up to four hours. Selected expression changes were validated using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Only miR-155 was significantly upregulated by LPS, changing in parallel with supernatant tumor necrosis factor-α concentration. Eight additional microRNAs, including miR-146a and miR-146b, showed significant expression change with time in culture without a clear LPS effect. Target predictions indicated a number of potential immunity-associated targets for miR-155 in the horse, including SOCS1, TAB2 and elements of the PI3K signaling pathway, suggesting that it is likely to influence the acute inflammatory response to LPS. Gene alignment showed extensive conservation of the miR-155 precursor gene and associated promoter regions between horses and humans. The basal and LPS-stimulated microRNA expression pattern characterized here were similar to those described in human leukocytes. As well as providing a resource for further research into the roles of microRNAs in immune responses in horses, this will facilitate inter-species comparative study of the role of microRNAs in the inflammatory cascade during endotoxemia and sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2619344736,"Processes involving heat generation and dissipation play an important role in the performance of numerous materials. The behavior of (semi-)aqueous materials such as hydrogels during production and application, but also properties of biological tissue in disease and therapy (e.g., hyperthermia) critically depend on heat regulation. However, currently available thermometry methods do not provide quantitative parameters characterizing the overall temperature distribution within a volume of soft matter. To this end, we present here a new paradigm enabling accurate, contactless quantification of thermal heterogeneity based on the line shape of a water proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum. First, the 1H NMR resonance from water serving as a ""temperature probe"" is transformed into a temperature curve. Then, the digital points of this temperature profile are used to construct a histogram by way of specifically developed algorithms. We demonstrate that from this histogram, at least eight quantitative parameters describing the underlying statistical temperature distribution can be computed: weighted median, weighted mean, standard deviation, range, mode(s), kurtosis, skewness, and entropy. All mathematical transformations and calculations are performed using specifically programmed EXCEL spreadsheets. Our new paradigm is helpful in detailed investigations of thermal heterogeneity, including dynamic characteristics of heat exchange at sub-second temporal resolution."

Quality of life (QoL) is a valid patient reported outcome and improvement of QoL represents an important treatment goal. There is a paucity of data on the effect of angiodysplasias on QoL. Therefore, we aim to evaluate QoL and fatigue in angiodysplasia patients. We performed a cross-sectional patient-reported outcome study. We included patients with endoscopy proven angiodysplasias and measured QoL with Short Form-36 and level of fatigue using Multi Fatigue Inventory-20. We distinguished three subgroups of patients according to disease severity: 1) with treatment for angiodysplasias, 2) without treatment for angiodysplasias and 3) without recent hospital visits. The primary outcome was the physical component summary (PCS) score on the SF-36. Multivariate regression analysis were performed to correct for differences at baseline. A total of 144 patients completed the questionnaires (response rate = 62%; mean age 68 years; 65% men). Angiodysplasia patients have a significant lower PCS compared to the age-matched general population (respectively 41.0 vs. 43.3, p = 0.01). Disease severity is independently associated with a negative outcome on QoL (ß -4.6, 95% CI -7.8--1.3). Similarly patients score lower on multiple QoL subdomains, i.e. role limitations due to physical health problems (40.8 vs. 44.0, p<0.01), general health (39.7 vs. 47.3, p<0.01). Angiodysplasia patients are more fatigued compared to the general population (male 56.1 vs. 48.5, p<0.01, female 59.2 vs. 51.5, p = 0.01). In conclusion, angiodysplasias are independently associated with clinically significant impairments in multiple domains of health-related QoL, especially in measures of functional limitation."

This study investigated the age-related copy number variability of the bovine TSPY gene, a new and unstudied aspect of the biology of TSPY that has been shown to vary among cattle breeds, individual bulls and somatic tissues. The subjects of this prospective 30-month long study were 25 Holstein bulls, sampled every six months. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to determine the relative TSPY copy number (rTSPY CN) and telomere length in the DNA samples extracted from blood. Twenty bulls showed an altered rTSPY CN after 30 months, although only 9 bulls showed a significant change (4 significant increase while 5 significant decrease, P<0.01). The sequential sampling provided the flow of rTSPY CN over six observations in 30 months and wide-spread variation of rTSPY CN was detected. Although a clear trend of the direction of change was not identifiable, the highly dynamic changes of individual rTSPY CN in aging bulls were observed here for the first time. In summary we have observed a highly variable rTSPY CN in bulls over a short period of time. Our results suggest the importance of further long term studies of the dynamics of rTSPY CN variablility."

Protein expression was studied on digital representations of IHC images across entire slides representing formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks. Using the training-set, the known association between Ki-67 and Gleason grade was confirmed. CD31 expression was more heterogeneous across samples and remained invariant with grade in this cohort. Interestingly, the Ki-67/CD31 ratio was significantly increased in high (Gleason ≥ 8) versus low/intermediate (Gleason ≤7) samples when assessed in the training-set and the whole-tissue block images. Further, the feasibility of the automated approach to process Tissue Microarray (TMA) samples in high throughput was evaluated. This work establishes an initial framework for automated analysis of co-localized protein expression and distribution in high-resolution digital microscopy images based on standard IHC techniques. Applied to a larger sample population, the approach may help to elucidate the biologic basis for the Gleason grade, which is the strongest, single factor distinguishing clinically aggressive from indolent prostate cancer."

However, long-term monitoring datasets are still rare but in high demand to correctly identify, evaluate and respond to environmental changes. In the presented study, a population of the riverine dragonfly, Orthetrum coerulescens (Odonata: Libellulidae), was monitored over a time period from 1989 to 2013. Study site was an artificial irrigation ditch in one of the last European stone steppes and “nature heritage”, the Crau in Southern France. This artificial riverine habitat has an unusual high diversity of odonate species, prominent indicators for evaluating freshwater habitats. A clearing of the canal and destruction of the bank vegetation in 1996 was assumed to have great negative impact on the odonate larval and adult populations. Two mitochondrial markers (CO1 & ND1) and a panel of nuclear microsatellite loci were used to assess the genetic diversity. Over time they revealed a dramatic decline in diversity parameters between the years 2004 and 2007, however not between 1996 and 1997. From 2007 onwards the population shows a stabilizing trend but has not reached the amount of genetic variation found at the beginning of this survey. This decline cannot be referred to the clearing of the canal or any other direct anthropogenic impact. Instead, it is most likely that the populations’ decay was due to by extreme weather conditions during the specific years. A severe drought was recorded for the summer months of these years, leading to reduced water levels in the canal causing also other water parameters to change, and therefore impacting temperature sensitive riverine habitat specialists like the O. coerulescens in a significant way. The data provide important insights into population genetic dynamics and metrics not always congruent with traditional monitoring data (e.g. abundance); a fact that should be regarded with caution when management plans for developed landscapes are designed."
https://openalex.org/W2619313528,"A large gap for the support of point-of-care testing is the availability of reagents to support quality control (QC) of diagnostic assays along the supply chain from the manufacturer to the end user. While reagents and systems exist to support QC of laboratory screening tests for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, they are not configured appropriately to support point-of-care testing. The feasibility of using lyophilized recombinant human G6PD as a QC reagent in novel point-of-care tests for G6PD deficiency is demonstrated.Human recombinant G6PD (r-G6PD) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Aliquots were stored at -80°C. Prior to lyophilization, aliquots were thawed, and three concentrations of r-G6PD (representing normal, intermediate, and deficient clinical G6PD levels) were prepared and mixed with a protective formulation, which protects the enzyme activity against degradation from denaturation during the lyophilization process. Following lyophilization, individual single-use tubes of lyophilized r-G6PD were placed in individual packs with desiccants and stored at five temperatures for one year. An enzyme assay for G6PD activity was used to ascertain the stability of r-G6PD activity while stored at different temperatures.Lyophilized r-G6PD is stable and can be used as a control indicator. Results presented here show that G6PD activity is stable for at least 365 days when stored at -80°C, 4°C, 30°C, and 45°C. When stored at 55°C, enzyme activity was found to be stable only through day 28.Lyophilized r-G6PD enzyme is stable and can be used as a control for point-of-care tests for G6PD deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2620029659,"The scattered eastern African high mountains harbor a renowned and highly endemic flora, but the taxonomy and phylogeographic history of many plant groups are still insufficiently known. The high-alpine populations of the Geranium arabicum/kilimandscharicum complex present intricate morphological variation and have recently been suggested to comprise two new endemic taxa. Here we aim to contribute to a clarification of the taxonomy of these populations by analyzing genetic (AFLP) variation in range-wide high-alpine samples, and we address whether hybridization has contributed to taxonomic problems. We identified only two genetic groups. One corresponded to G. kilimandscharicum, which has been reported as exclusively high-alpine and confined to the eastern Rift mountains in East Africa. The other corresponded to G. arabicum, reported from lower altitudes on the same mountains as well as from a wide altitudinal span in Ethiopia and on the western Rift mountains in East Africa. The four populations analyzed of a recently described species from the Bale Mts in Ethiopia were admixed, indicating that they result from recent long-distance dispersal of G. kilimandscharicum from East Africa followed by hybridization with local G. arabicum in naturally disturbed habitats. Some admixture between the two genetic groups was also inferred on other mountains, supporting earlier suggestions of introgression based on morphology. We did not find support for recognition of the recently suggested new subspecies of G. arabicum in Ethiopia. Interestingly, the high-alpine G. kilimandscharicum lacked clear geographic structuring, suggesting a recent history of colonization of the different mountains or extensive intermountain gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W2618796452,"The interplay between cellular adhesion and proliferation is complex; however, integrins, particularly the α5β1 subset, play a pivotal role in orchestrating critical cellular signals that culminate in cellular adhesion and growth. Retinoids modify the expression of a variety of adhesive/proliferative signaling proteins including α5β1 integrins; however, the role of specific retinoic acid receptors involved in these processes has not been elucidated. In this study, the effect of all-trans-retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonists on K562 cellular adhesion, proliferation, and α5β1 integrin cell surface expression was investigated. RARγ agonist exposure increased K562 cellular adhesion to RGD containing extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and FN-120 in a time- and concentration dependent manner, while RARα or RARβ agonist treatment had no effect on cellular adhesion. Due to the novel RARγ- dependent cellular adhesion response exhibited by K562 cells, we examined α5 and β1 integrin subunit expression when K562 cells were exposed to retinoid agonists or vehicle for 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours. Our data demonstrates no differences in K562 cell surface expression of the α5 integrin subunit when cells were exposed to RARα, RARβ, or RARγ agonists for all time points tested. In contrast, RARγ agonist exposure resulted in an increase in cell surface β1 integrin subunit expression within 48 hours that was sustained at 72 and 96 hours. Finally, we demonstrate that while exposure to RARα or RARβ agonists have no effect on K562 cellular proliferation, the RARγ agonist significantly dampens K562 cellular proliferation levels in a time- and concentration- dependent manner. Our study is the first to report that treatment with a RARγ specific agonist augments cellular adhesion to α5β1 integrin substrates, increases cell surface levels of the β1 integrin subunit, and dampens cellular proliferation in a time and concentration dependent manner in a human erythroleukemia cell line."
