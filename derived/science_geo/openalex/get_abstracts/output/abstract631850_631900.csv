https://openalex.org/W2940489575,"In order to understand the degradation potential of plastics in the marine environment, microorganisms that preferentially colonize and interact with plastic surfaces, as opposed to generalists potentially colonising everything, need to be identified. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that i.) plastic ""specific"" microorganisms are closely attached to the polymeric surface and ii.) that specificity of plastics biofilms are rather related to members of the rare biosphere. To answer these hypotheses, a three phased experiment to stepwise uncover closely attached microbes was conducted. In Phase 1, nine chemically distinct plastic films and glass were incubated in situ for 21 months in a seawater flow through system. In Phase 2, a high-pressure water jet treatment technique was used to remove the upper biofilm layers to further, in Phase 3, enrich a plastic ""specific"" community. To proof whether microbes colonizing different plastics are distinct from each other and from other inert hard substrates, the bacterial communities of these different substrates were analysed using 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing. Our findings indicate that tightly attached microorganisms account to the rare biosphere and suggest the presence of plastic ""specific"" microorganisms/assemblages which could benefit from the given plastic properties or at least grow under limited carbon resources."
https://openalex.org/W2940586384,"Cities are major drivers of environmental change at all scales and are especially at risk from the ensuing effects, which include poor air quality, flooding and heat waves. Typically, these issues are studied on a city-by-city basis owing to the spatial complexity of built landscapes, local topography and emission patterns. However, to ensure knowledge sharing and to integrate local-scale processes with regional and global scale modelling initiatives, there is a pressing need for a world-wide database on cities that is suited for environmental studies. In this paper we present a European database that has a particular focus on characterising urbanised landscapes. It has been derived using tools and techniques developed as part of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project, which has the goal of acquiring and disseminating climate-relevant information on cities worldwide. The European map is the first major step toward creating a global database on cities that can be integrated with existing topographic and natural land-cover databases to support modelling initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2942272119,"A growing body of literature suggests that post-secondary students experience food insecurity (FI) at greater rates than the general population. However, these rates vary dramatically across institutions and studies. FI assessment methods commonly used in studies with college students have not been scrutinized for psychometric properties, and varying protocols may influence resulting FI prevalence estimates. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of standard food security assessment protocols and to evaluate their agreement as well as the relative accuracy of these protocols in identifying student FI. A randomized sample of 4,000 undergraduate students were invited to participate in an online survey (Qualtrics, LLC, Provo, Utah, USA) that evaluated sociodemographic characteristics and FI with the 2-item food sufficiency screener and the 10-item USDA Adult Food Security Survey Module (FSSM; containing the abbreviated 6-item module). Four hundred sixty-two eligible responses were included in the final sample. The psychometric analysis revealed inconsistencies in college student response patterns on the FSSM when compared to national evaluations. Agreement between FI protocols was generally high (>90%) but was lessened when compared with a protocol that incorporated the 2-item screener. The 10-item FSSM with the 2-item screener had the best model fit (McFadden’s R2 = 0.15 and Bayesian Information Criterion = -2049.72) and emerged as the tool providing the greatest relative accuracy for identifying students with FI. Though the 10-item FSSM and 2-item screener yields the most accuracy in this sample, it is unknown why students respond to FSSM items differently than the general population. Further qualitative and quantitative evaluations are needed to determine which assessment protocol is the most valid and reliable for use in accurately identifying FI in post-secondary students across the U.S."
https://openalex.org/W2941796363,"The growing multi-hazard environment to which millions of people in the world are exposed highlights the importance of making sure that populations are increasingly better prepared. The objective of this study was to report the levels of preparedness of a community exposed to two natural hazards and identify the primary sociodemographic characteristics of groups with different preparedness levels. A survey was conducted on 476 participants from two localities of the Atacama Region in the north of Chile during the spring of 2015. Their level of preparedness at home and work was assessed to face two types of natural hazards: earthquakes and floods.The findings show that participants are significantly better prepared to face earthquakes than floods, which sends a serious warning to local authorities, given that floods have caused the greatest human and material losses in the region’s recent history of natural disasters. Men claimed to be more prepared than women to face floods, something that the authors attribute to the particular characteristics of the main employment sectors for men and women in the region. The potential contribution of large companies on preparedness levels of communities in the areas in which they operate is discussed. The sociodemographic profile of individuals with the highest levels of preparedness in an environment with multiple natural hazards are people between 30 and 59 years of age, living with their partner and school-age children. The implications of the results pertaining to institutions responsible for developing disaster risk reduction plans, policies and programs in a multi-hazard environment are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2940671321,"Middle Paleolithic lithic and faunal assemblages throughout Eurasia reflect short-term Neanderthal occupations, which suggest high group mobility. However, the timing of these short-term occupations, a key factor to assess group mobility and territorial range, remains unresolved. Anthropogenic combustion structures are prominent in the Middle Paleolithic record and conceal information on the timing and intensity and natural setting of their associated human occupations. This paper examines a concentration of eleven combustion structures from unit Xb of El Salt, a Middle Paleolithic site in Spain through a geoarchaeological approach, in search of temporal, human impact and paleoenvironmental indicators to assess the timing, intensity and natural setting of the associated human occupations. The study was conducted using micromorphology, lipid biomarker analysis and compound specific isotope analysis. Results show in situ hearths built on different diachronic topsoils rich in herbivore excrements and angiosperm plant residues with rare anthropogenic remains. These data are suggestive of low impact, short-term human occupations separated by relatively long periods of time, with possible indicators of seasonality. Results also show an absence of conifer biomarkers in the mentioned topsoils and presence of conifer charcoal among the fuel residues (ash), indicating that fire wood was brought to the site from elsewhere. A microscopic and molecular approach in the study of combustion structures allows us to narrow down the timescale of archaeological analysis and contributes valuable information towards an understanding of Neanderthal group mobility and settlement patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2953127196,"Background Intraspecific variation in foraging niche can drive food web dynamics and ecosystem processes. In particular, male and female animals can exhibit different, often cascading, impacts on their interaction partners. Despite this, studies of plant-pollinator interaction networks have focused on the partitioning of the floral community between pollinator species, with little attention paid to intraspecific variation in plant preference between male and female bees. We designed a field study to evaluate the strength and prevalence of sexually dimorphic foraging, and particularly resource preferences, in bees. Study design We observed bees visiting flowers in semi-natural meadows in New Jersey, USA. To detect differences in flower use against a shared background of resource (flower) availability, we maximized the number of interactions observed within narrow spatio-temporal windows. To distinguish observed differences in bee use of flower species, which can reflect abundance patterns and sampling effects, from underlying differences in bee preferences, we analyzed our data with both a permutation-based null model and random effects models. Findings We found that the diets of male and female bees of the same species were often dissimilar as the diets of different species of bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate differences in preference between male and female bees. We show that intraspecific differences in preference can be robustly identified among hundreds of unique species-species interactions, without precisely quantifying resource availability, and despite high phenological turnover of both bees and plant bloom. Given the large differences in both flower use and preferences between male and female bees, ecological sex differences should be integrated into studies of bee demography, plant pollination, and coevolutionary relationships between flowers and insects."

https://openalex.org/W2940701515,"Osteoporosis is a major health problem, making bones fragile and susceptible to fracture. Previous works showed that mechanical loading stimulated bone formation and accelerated fracture healing. Focusing on the role of Wnt3a (wingless/integrated 3a), this study was aimed to assess effects of mechanical loading to the spine, using ovariectomized (OVX) mice as a model of osteoporosis. Two-week daily application of this novel loading (4 N, 10 Hz, 5 min/d) altered bone remodeling with an increase in Wnt3a. Spinal loading promoted osteoblast differentiation, endothelial progenitor cell migration, and tube formation and inhibited osteoclast formation, migration, and adhesion. A transient silencing of Wnt3a altered the observed loading effects. Spinal loading significantly increased bone mineral density, bone mineral content, and bone area per tissue area. The loaded OVX group showed a significant increase in the number of osteoblasts and reduction in osteoclast surface/bone surface. Though expression of osteoblastic genes was increased, the levels of osteoclastic genes were decreased by loading. Spinal loading elevated a microvascular volume as well as VEGF expression. Collectively, this study supports the notion that Wnt3a-mediated signaling involves in the effect of spinal loading on stimulating bone formation, inhibiting bone resorption, and promoting angiogenesis in OVX mice. It also suggests that Wnt3a might be a potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis treatment.-Li, X., Liu, D., Li, J., Yang, S., Xu, J., Yokota, H., Zhang, P.

https://openalex.org/W2941379258,"The EPH receptor A2 (EphA2) tyrosine kinase plays an important role in a plethora of biological and disease processes, ranging from angiogenesis and cancer to inflammation and parasitic infections. EphA2 is therefore considered an important drug target. Two short peptides previously identified by phage display, named YSA and SWL, are widely used as EphA2-targeting agents owing to their high specificity for this receptor. However, these peptides have only modest (micromolar) potency. Lack of structural information on the binding interactions of YSA and SWL with the extracellular EphA2 ligand-binding domain (LBD) has for many years precluded structure-guided improvements. We now report the high-resolution (1.53–2.20 Å) crystal structures of the YSA peptide and several of its improved derivatives in complex with the EphA2 LBD, disclosing that YSA targets the ephrin-binding pocket of EphA2 and mimics binding features of the ephrin-A ligands. The structural information obtained enabled iterative peptide modifications conferring low nanomolar potency. Furthermore, contacts observed in the crystal structures shed light on how C-terminal features can convert YSA derivatives from antagonists to agonists that likely bivalently interact with two EphA2 molecules to promote receptor oligomerization, autophosphorylation, and downstream signaling. Consistent with this model, quantitative FRET measurements in live cells revealed that the peptide agonists promote the formation of EphA2 oligomeric assemblies. Our findings now enable rational strategies to differentially modify EphA2 signaling toward desired outcomes by using appropriately engineered peptides. Such peptides could be used as research tools to interrogate EphA2 function and to develop pharmacological leads.

https://openalex.org/W2941653762,"Introduction Conducting rigorous scientific inquiry within the bounds of research regulation and acceptable practice requires a principal investigator to lead and manage research processes and personnel. This study explores the practices used by investigators nominated as exemplars of research excellence and integrity to produce rigorous, reproducible research and comply with research regulations. Methods Using a qualitative research design, we interviewed 52 principal investigators working in the United States at top research universities and the National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program. We solicited nominations of researchers meeting two criteria: (1) they are federally-funded researchers doing high-quality, high-impact research, and (2) have reputations for professionalism and integrity. Each investigator received an initial nomination addressing both criteria and at least one additional endorsement corroborating criteria 2. A panel of researchers and our research team reviewed the nominations to select finalists who were invited to participate. The cohort of “Research Exemplars” includes highly accomplished researchers in diverse scientific disciplines. The semi-structured interview questions asked them to describe the routine practices they employ to foster rigor and regulatory compliance. We used inductive thematic analysis to identify common practices. Results The exemplars identified a core set of 8 practices and provided strategies for employing them. The practices included holding regular team meetings, encouraging shared ownership, providing supervision, ensuring adequate training, fostering positive attitudes about compliance, scrutinizing data and findings, and following standard operating procedures. Above all, the use of these practices aim to create a psychologically safe work environment in which lab members openly collaborate to scrutinize their work and share in accountability for rigorous, compliant research. Conclusions Researchers typically receive limited systematic training in how to lead and manage their research teams. Training and education for principal investigators should include essential leadership and management practices and strategies that support doing high-quality research with integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2940975769,"Background In patients with neuromuscular disorders, assessment of respiratory function relies on forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements. Providing complementary respiratory outcomes may be useful for clinical trials. Diaphragm sniff ultrasound (US) is a noninvasive technique that can assess diaphragm function that may be affected in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Purpose We aimed to provide normal values of sniff diaphragm ultrasound, to assess the relationship between sniff diaphragm US, vital capacity (VC) and sniff nasal pressure. Additionally, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of sniff diaphragm US for predicting restrictive pulmonary insufficiency. Materials and methods We included patients with neuromuscular disorders that had been tested with a sniff diaphragm US and functional respiratory tests. Healthy subjects were also included to obtain normal diaphragm sniff ultrasound. We performed diaphragm tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and time movement (TM) diaphragm echography combined with sniff maneuver. Results A total of 89 patients with neuromuscular diseases and 27 healthy subjects were included in our study. In patients, the median age was 32 years [25; 50] and the median FVC was 34% of predicted [18; 55]. Sniff diaphragm motion using TM ultrasound was significantly associated with sniff nasal pressure, both for the right hemidiaphragm (r = 0.6 p <0.0001) and the left hemidiaphragm (r = 0.63 p = 0.0008). Right sniff peak TDI velocity was also significantly associated with FVC (r = 0.72, p<0.0001) and with sniff nasal pressure (r = 0.66 p<0.0001). Sniff diaphragm ultrasound using either TM mode or TDI displayed significant accuracy for predicting FVC<60% with an area under curve (AUC) reaching 0.93 (p<0.0001) for the right sniff diaphragm ultrasound in TM mode and 0.86 (p<0.001) for right peak diaphragm TDI velocity. Conclusion Sniff diaphragm TM and TDI measures were significantly associated with sniff nasal pressure. Sniff diaphragm TM and TDI had a high level of accuracy to reveal respiratory involvement in patients with neuromuscular disorders. This technique is useful to assess and follow up diaphragm function in patients with neuromuscular disorders. It may be used as a respiratory outcome for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2752398760,"This study adopts a socio-ecological approach to examine multiple factors and processes assumed to shape the intergenerational transmission of social disadvantage, including influences of social change, social causation and social selection. Moving beyond approaches focusing on cumulative risk indices, this study uses latent class analysis to examine how different socio-economic and psycho-social risk factors combine within families and to what extent and how constellations of risk are transmitted from one generation to the next. We draw on data collected for the longitudinal and national representative 1970 British Cohort Study, comprising information on more than 11,000 cohort members and their parents. We identified four distinct risk configurations among the parent generation (G1): low-risk families (57.6%), high-risk families (16.3%), high-risk single-parents (24%) and ethnic minority families (2.1%). Within their offspring (G2) we identified five distinct risk configurations: low-risk families (62%), low-risk no-children (15.1%), moderate-risk single parents (10.1%), moderate-risk large families (8.9%), high socio-economic and high psycho-social risk (4%). There is evidence of structural mobility, and the findings suggest that intergenerational transmission of disadvantage is not just a systemic tendency towards social reproduction, but also reflects processes of social change and social selection. We conclude that a socio-ecological model provides a useful framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the multiple processes involved in the transmission of inter-cohort inequality."
https://openalex.org/W2941863759,"Background There is wide international variation regarding food allergy knowledge among restaurant staff. Further, attitudes towards food allergy remain under-researched. Insights into the independent determinants of knowledge and attitudes are limited due to lacking mutual statistical adjustment for determinants/confounders in the vast majority of prior studies. In this study we aimed to contribute novel data on the food allergy knowledge and attitudes among restaurant staff in Germany whilst also examining potential determinants of both outcomes using multivariable approaches. Methods We collected data face-to-face from 295 staff members in restaurants in Düsseldorf, Germany. Knowledge was assessed by asking participants to name three common food allergens and to answer five true/false-statements. Seven items assessed attitudes. A total of 16 potential determinants were examined using logistic regression models with backward selection. Results Only 30% (n = 89) of the respondents correctly named three food allergens and 41% (n = 120) attained a perfect score on the true/false statements. The vast majority expressed positive attitudes toward the need for cooperation and shared responsibilities for food-allergic customers. However, the expressed attitudes towards serving customers with food allergies and validity of customer-reported food allergies were unfavorable. Determinants of food allergy knowledge (e.g. the type of restaurant, professional roles, or levels of school education) and of unfavorable attitudes (e.g. gender) were identified. Conclusions Food allergy knowledge was suboptimal among restaurant staff and attitudes towards customers were rather poor. While we identified some determinants, additional studies are needed to systematically examine potential determinants for targetting educational interventions in the future."

Subjects were classified into three groups based on the level of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). UACR < 30 mg/g was defined as normoalbuminuria, while UACR levels of 30-300 mg/g and ≥ 300 mg/g were defined as microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, respectively. Serum 25OHD and other clinical characteristics among various UACR groups were compared. The relationship between albuminuiria and 25OHD was analyzed.The prevalence of 25OHD insufficiency in the microalbuminuria group was significantly higher than that in the normoalbuminuria group (25.1% vs. 19.6%; P < 0.05); patients with macroalbuminuria had the highest prevalence of 25OHD deficiency (37.8%; P < 0.01 versus normoalbuminuria). Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that low 25OHD levels were associated with DKD [odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.97). The association was more robust after adjusting for sex, hypertension, increased systolic blood pressure, glycemic status, and hyperuricemia (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.19-2.20).The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in patients with albuminuria was overtly higher than that in patients without albuminuria among Chinese adults with type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency was independently associated with DKD in type 2 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2940921763,"Dynamin 2 (DNM2) is a GTP-binding protein that controls endocytic vesicle scission and defines a whole class of dynamin-dependent endocytosis, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis by caveoli. It has been suggested that mutations in the DNM2 gene, associated with 3 inherited diseases, disrupt endocytosis. However, how exactly mutations affect the nanoscale morphology of endocytic machinery has never been studied. In this paper, we used live correlative scanning ion conductance microscopy (S1CM) and fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) to study how disease-associated mutations affect the morphology and kinetics of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) by directly following their dynamics of formation, maturation, and internalization in skin fibroblasts from patients with centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and in Cos-7 ce1ls expressing corresponding dynamin mutants. Using S1CM-FCM, which we have deve1oped, we show how p.R465W mutation disrupts pit structure, preventing its maturation and internalization, and significantly increases the lifetime of CCPs. Differently, p.R522H slows down the formation of CCPs without affecting their internalization. We also found that CNM mutations in DNM2 affect the distribution of caveoli and reduce dorsal ruffling in human skin fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2940857204,"The alkaloid narciclasine has been characterized extensively as an anticancer compound. Accumulating evidence suggests that narciclasine has anti-inflammatory potential; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that narciclasine affects the activation of endothelial cells (ECs), a hallmark of inflammatory processes, which is a prerequisite for leukocyte-EC interaction. Thus, we aimed to investigate narciclasine's action on this process in vivo and to analyze the underlying mechanisms in vitro. In a murine peritonitis model, narciclasine reduced leukocyte infiltration, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and inflammation-associated abdominal pain. Moreover, narciclasine decreased rolling and blocked adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes in vivo. In cultured ECs, narciclasine inhibited the expression of cell adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin and blocked crucial steps of the NF-κB activation cascade: NF-κB promotor activity, p65 nuclear translocation, inhibitor of κB α (IκBα) phosphorylation and degradation, and IκBα kinase β and TGF-β-activated kinase 1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, these effects were based on the narciclasine-triggered loss of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). Our study highlights narciclasine as an interesting anti-inflammatory compound that effectively inhibits the interaction of leukocytes with ECs by blocking endothelial activation processes. Most importantly, we showed that the observed inhibitory action of narciclasine on TNF-triggered signaling pathways is based on the loss of TNFR1.-Stark, A., Schwenk, R., Wack, G., Zuchtriegel, G., Hatemler, M.

https://openalex.org/W2941300201,"Background Mentoring nurtures a mentee’s personal and professional development. Yet conflation of mentoring approaches and a failure to contend with mentoring’s nature makes it difficult to study mentoring processes and relationships. This study aims to understand of mentee experiences in the Palliative Medicine Initiative (PMI). The PMI uses a consistent mentoring approach amongst a homogeneous mentee population offers a unique opportunity to circumnavigate conflation of practices and the limitations posed by mentoring’s nature. The data will advance understanding of mentoring processes. Methods Sixteen mentees discussed their PMI experiences in individual face-to-face audio-recorded interviews. The two themes identified from thematic analysis of interview transcripts were the stages of mentoring and communication. Results The 6 stages of mentoring are the ‘pre-mentoring stage’, ‘initial research meetings’, ‘data gathering’, ‘review of initial findings, ‘manuscript preparation” and ‘reflections’. These subthemes sketch the progression of mentees from being dependent on the mentor for support and guidance, to an independent learner with capacity and willingness to mentor others. Each subtheme is described as stages in the mentoring process (mentoring stages) given their association with a specific phase of the research process. Mentoring processes also pivot on effective communication which are influenced by the mentor’s characteristics and the nature of mentoring interactions. Conclusion Mentoring relationships evolve in stages to ensure particular competencies are met before mentees progress to the next part of their mentoring process. Progress is dependent upon effective communication and support from the mentor and appropriate and timely adaptations to the mentoring approach to meet the mentee’s needs and goals. Adaptations to the mentoring structure are informed by effective and holistic evaluation of the mentoring process and the mentor’s and mentee’s abilities, goals and situations. These findings underline the need to review and redesign the way assessments of the mentoring process are constructed and how mentoring programs are structured."
https://openalex.org/W2940544358,"Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans have been linked to alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota and metabolome. Knowledge of these associations has improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases and guided development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions. The cellular and molecular pathophysiology of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) and obesity in horses, however, remain ill-defined. Thus, the objectives of this study were to characterize the fecal microbiome, fecal metabolome, and circulating lipidome in obese and non-obese horses. The fecal microbiota, fecal metabolome, and serum lipidome were evaluated in obese (case) horses (n = 20) and non-obese (control) horses (n = 20) matched by farm of origin (n = 7). Significant differences in metabolites of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle and circulating free fatty acids were identified in the obese horses compared to the non-obese horses. These results indicate that the host and bacterial metabolism should be considered important in obese horses. Further studies to determine whether these associations are causal and the mechanistic basis of the association are warranted because they might reveal diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions to mitigate obesity, EMS, and sequelae including laminitis."
https://openalex.org/W2940641004,"The present study describes the discovery of a singular sedimentary structure corresponding to an ichnite that was excavated at the paleo-archaeological site Pilauco (Osorno, Chile). The trace fossil is associated with megafauna bones, plant material and unifacial lithic tools. Here we present a detailed analysis of the Pilauco ichnite and associated sedimentary structures, as well as new radiocarbon data. The ichnological analysis confidently assigns the trace to the ichnospecies Hominipes modernus—a hominoid footprint usually related to Homo sapiens. Some particular characteristics of the Pilauco trace include an elongated distal hallux, lateral digit impressions obliterated by the collapsed sediment, and sediment lumps inside and around the trace. In order to evaluate the origin of the ichnite, trackmaking experiments are performed on re-hydrated fossil bed sediments. The results demonstrate that a human agent could easily generate a footprint morphology equivalent to the sedimentary structure when walking on a saturated substrate. Based on the evidence, we conclude that the trackmaker might well have been a bare-footed adult human. This finding, along with the presence of lithic artifacts in the same sedimentary levels, might represent further evidence for a pre-Clovis South American colonization of northern Patagonia, as originally proposed for the nearby Monte Verde site."
https://openalex.org/W2940696257,"People’s perceptions can point to reasons for conservation support or lack thereof. In this study, we surveyed the perceptions of conservation among local stakeholders who participated in protected area (PA) management following a reform towards community-based conservation in Norway. We analyzed the link between perceptions of threats to conservation values, prioritized management actions and trust in PA governance, and assessed how these perceptions aligned with the stakeholders’ preferred overarching conservation approach and their support for PAs. Conservation perceptions differed mostly between property owners and representatives of nature conservation (such as NGOs). Property owners perceived modern farming, grazing and hay making, and securing the interests of rights holders as a priority. They had a lower support for PAs and favored a conservation approach focusing on “people and nature”. Representatives from nature conservation prioritized management actions to increase biodiversity and reduce land development, had higher trust in environmental authorities and identified motorized vehicle use as a threat to conservation values. They had a high support for PAs and favored a conservation approach that mitigates threats from human activity (i.e. “nature despite people”). The nationwide reform aimed at increasing support for PAs, but 31% of the members of the stakeholder advisory councils were willing to downgrade or degazette PAs for the benefit of economic development, which is much more than general population surveys. However, the level of trust in local governance was less polarized among the members of stakeholder advisory councils compared with the former state governance, which suggests that that the community-based conservation reform has the potential to improve collaboration and conflict mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W2942270140,"Under physiologic conditions, conjunctival goblet cells (CGCs) secrete mucins into the tear film to preserve ocular surface homeostasis. Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), like resolvins (Rvs), regulate secretion from CGCs and actively terminate inflammation. The purpose of this study was to determine if RvD2 stimulated mucin secretion and to investigate the cellular signaling components. Goblet cells were cultured from rat conjunctiva. Secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay, change in intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) using Fura-2, and cellular cAMP levels by ELISA. RvD2 (10−11–10−8 M) stimulated secretion, increased cellular cAMP levels and the [Ca2+]i. RvD2-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i and secretion was blocked by Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis and the PKA inhibitor N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride but not by the cAMP exchange protein inhibitor α[2-(3-chlorophenyl)hydrazinylidene]-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-b-oxo-3-isoxazolepropanenitrile. Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) increased [Ca2+]i. Increasing cAMP with 8-Br-cAMP inhibited the increase in [Ca2+]i stimulated by the cAMP-independent agonist cholinergic agonist carbachol. In conclusion, RvD2 uses both cellular cAMP and [Ca2+]i to stimulate glycoconjugate secretion from CGCs, but the interaction of cAMP and [Ca2+]i is context dependent. Thus RvD2 likely assists in the maintenance of the mucous layer of the tear film to sustain ocular surface homeostasis and has potential as a novel treatment for dry eye disease.—Botten, N., Hodges, R.

https://openalex.org/W2940615241,"Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are regenerated continuously from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) near the base of intestinal crypts in order to maintain homeostasis and structural integrity of intestinal epithelium. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is thought to be important to drive the proliferation and differentiation of IECs from ISCs, it remains unknown whether other growth factors or lipid mediators are also important for such regulation, however. Here we show that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), instead of EGF, robustly promoted the development of intestinal organoids prepared from the mouse small intestine. Indeed, LPA exhibited the proliferative activity of IECs as well as induction of differentiation of IECs into goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells in intestinal organoids. Inhibitors for LPA receptor 1 markedly suppressed the LPA-promoted development of intestinal organoids. LPA also promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in intestinal organoids, whereas inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 significantly suppressed the development of, as well as the proliferative activity and differentiation of, intestinal organoids in response to LPA. Our results thus suggest that LPA is a key factor that drives the proliferation and differentiation of IECs."
https://openalex.org/W2942401232,"The genomic landscape in human B-cell lymphoma has revealed several somatic mutations and potentially relevant germline alterations affecting therapy and prognosis. Also, mutations originally described as somatic aberrations have been shown to confer cancer predisposition when occurring in the germline. The relevance of mutations in canine B-cell lymphoma is scarcely known and gene expression profiling has shown similar molecular signatures among different B-cell histotypes, suggesting other biological mechanisms underlining differences. Here, we present a highly accurate approach to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA-seq data obtained from 62 completely staged canine B-cell lymphomas and 11 normal B-cells used as controls. A customized variant discovery pipeline was applied and SNVs were found in tumors and differentiated for histotype. A number of known and not previously identified SNVs were significantly associated to MAPK signaling pathway, negative regulation of apoptotic process and cell death, B-cell activation, NF-kB and JAK-STAT signaling. Interestingly, no significant genetic fingerprints were found separating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from indolent lymphomas suggesting that differences of genetic landscape are not the pivotal causative factor of indolent behavior. We also detected several variants in expressed regions of canine B-cell lymphoma and identified SNVs having a direct impact on genes. Using this brand-new approach the consequence of a gene variant is directly associated to expression. Further investigations are in progress to deeply elucidate the mechanisms by which altered genes pathways may drive lymphomagenesis and a higher number of cases is also demanded to confirm this evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2942131358,"Sea turtle populations are often assessed at the regional to sub-basin scale from discrete indices of nesting abundance. While this may be practical and sometimes effective, widespread in-water surveys may enhance assessments by including additional demographics, locations, and revealing emerging population trends. Here, we describe sea turtle observations from 13 years of towed-diver surveys across 53 coral islands, atolls, and reefs in the Central, West, and South Pacific. These surveys covered more than 7,300 linear km, and observed more than 3,400 green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles. From these data, we estimated sea turtle densities, described trends across space and time, and modelled the influence of environmental and anthropogenic drivers. Both species were patchily distributed across spatial scales, and green turtles were 11 times more abundant than hawksbills. The Pacific Remote Island Areas had the highest densities of greens (3.62 turtles km-1, Jarvis Island), while American Samoa had the most hawksbills (0.12 turtles km-1, Ta'u Island). The Hawaiian Islands had the lowest turtle densities (island ave = 0.07 turtles km-1) yet the highest annual population growth (μ = 0.08, σ = 0.22), suggesting extensive management protections can yield positive conservation results. Densities peaked at 27.5°C SST, in areas of high productivity and low human impact, and were consistent with patterns of historic overexploitation. Though such intensive surveys have great value, they are logistically demanding and therefore have an uncertain budget and programmatic future. We hope the methods we described here may be applied to future comparatively low-cost surveys either with autonomous vehicles or with environmental DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2953173068,"Genome-wide association studies on alcohol dependence, by themselves, have yet to account for the estimated heritability of the disorder and provide incomplete mechanistic understanding of this complex trait. Integrating brain ethanol-responsive gene expression networks from model organisms with human genetic data on alcohol dependence could aid in identifying dependence-associated genes and functional networks in which they are involved. This study used a modification of the Edge-Weighted Dense Module Searching for genome-wide association studies (EW-dmGWAS) approach to co-analyze whole-genome gene expression data from ethanol-exposed mouse brain tissue, human protein-protein interaction databases and alcohol dependence-related genome-wide association studies. Results revealed novel ethanol-responsive and alcohol dependence-associated gene networks in prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and ventral tegmental area. Three of these networks were overrepresented with genome-wide association signals from an independent dataset. These networks were significantly overrepresented for gene ontology categories involving several mechanisms, including actin filament-based activity, transcript regulation, Wnt and Syndecan-mediated signaling, and ubiquitination. Together, these studies provide novel insight for brain mechanisms contributing to alcohol dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2941357110,"Background Ambulatory function predicts morbidity and mortality and may be influenced by cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Persons living with HIV (PLWH) suffer from a high prevalence of cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities that may contribute to higher risk of ambulatory dysfunction as measured by 6-minute walk test distance (6-MWD). We investigated the effect of HIV on 6-MWD. Methods PLWH and HIV-uninfected individuals were enrolled from 2 clinical centers and completed a 6-MWD, spirometry, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Results of 6-MWD were compared between PLWH and uninfected individuals after adjusting for confounders. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to determine predictors of 6-MWD. Results Mean 6-MWD in PLWH was 431 meters versus 462 in 130 HIV-uninfected individuals (p = 0.0001). Older age, lower forced expiratory volume (FEV1)% or lower forced vital capacity (FVC)%, and smoking were significant predictors of decreased 6-MWD in PLWH, but not HIV-uninfected individuals. Lower DLCO% and higher SGRQ were associated with lower 6-MWD in both groups. In a combined model, HIV status remained an independent predictor of decreased 6-MWD (Mean difference = -19.9 meters, p = 0.005). Conclusions HIV infection was associated with decreased ambulatory function. Airflow limitation and impaired diffusion capacity can partially explain this effect. Subjective assessments of respiratory symptoms may identify individuals at risk for impaired physical function who may benefit from early intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2950734830,"Epithelial wound healing requires the coordination of cells to migrate as a unit over the basement membrane after injury. To understand the process of this coordinated movement, it is critical to study the dynamics of cell-cell communication. We developed a method to characterize the injury-induced sustained Ca2+ mobilizations that travel between cells for periods of time up to several hours. These events of communication are concentrated along the wound edge and are reduced in cells further away from the wound. Our goal was to delineate the role and contribution of these sustained mobilizations and using MATLAB analyses, we determined the probability of cell-cell communication events in both in vitro models and ex vivo organ culture models. We demonstrated that the injury response was complex and represented the activation of a number of receptors. In addition, we found that pannexin channels mediated the cell-cell communication and motility. Furthermore, the sustained Ca2+ mobilizations are associated with changes in cell morphology and motility during wound healing. The results demonstrate that both purinoreceptors and pannexins regulate the sustained Ca2+ mobilization necessary for cell-cell communication in wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2940548988,"Background Stress causes severe dysmotility in the mammalian gut. Almost all research done to date has concentrated on prevention of stress-induced altered gut motility but not on treatment. We had previously shown that intraluminal 2′FL could acutely moderate propulsive motility in isolated mouse colonic segments. Because 2′FL appeared to modulate enteric nervous system dependent motility, we wondered if the oligosaccharide could reverse the effects of prior restraint stress, ex vivo. We tested whether 2′FL could benefit the dysmotility of isolated jejunal and colonic segments from animals subjected to prior acute restraint stress. Methods Jejunal and colonic segments were obtained from male Swiss Webster mice that were untreated or subjected to 1 hour of acute restraint stress. Segments were perfused with Krebs buffer and propagating contractile clusters (PCC) digitally video recorded. 2′FL or β-lactose were added to the perfusate at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Spatiotemporal maps were constructed from paired before and after treatment recordings, each consisting of 20 min duration and PCC analyzed for frequency, velocity and amplitude. Key Results Stress decreased propulsive motility in murine small intestine while increasing it in the colon. 2′FL in jejunum of previously stressed mice produced a 50% increase in PCC velocity (p = 0.0001), a 43% increase in frequency (p = 0.0002) and an insignificant decrease in peak amplitude. For stressed colon, 2′FL reduced the frequency by 23% (p = 0.017) and peak amplitude by 26% (p = 0.011), and was without effect on velocity. β-lactose had negligible or small treatment effects. Conclusions & Inferences We show that the prebiotic 2′FL may have potential as a treatment for acute stress-induced gut dysmotility, ex vivo, and that, as is the case for certain beneficial microbes, the mechanism occurs in the gut, likely via action on the enteric nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2942256774,"Background Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the main cause of new infections worldwide. We aimed at assessing the percentage of infants successfully immunized in two major hospitals in Vientiane, Lao PDR where HB immune globulin (HBIg) is not available. Methods We studied a prospective cohort of chronically HBV infected pregnant women and their infants until 6 months post-partum from January 2015 to March 2017. All infants received HB vaccine at birth and 6, 10 and 14 weeks thereafter, and HBV status was assessed at 6 months of age. HBV surface gene sequencing was performed in infected mother-infant pairs. Results Of 153 mothers with HB surface antigen (HBsAg), 60 (39%) had detectable serum HBe antigen (HBeAg). HBeAg positive pregnant women were younger than those negative (median age 26 versus 28 years; p = 0.02) and had a significantly higher HBV viral load at delivery (median 8.0 versus 4.0 log10 IU/mL, p <0.001). Among the 120 infants assessed at 6 months of age, 5 (4%) were positive for HBsAg and had detectable HBV viral load by polymerase chain reaction. All were born to mothers with HBeAg and viral load >8.5 log10 IU/mL. However, only four (3.3%, 95% CI 0.5% to 7.0%) had a virus strain closely related to their mother’s strain. HBV surface gene mutations were detected in 4 of the 5 infected infants. Anti-HBs antibody levels were below 10 IU/L in 10 (9%) uninfected infants at 6 months of age. Conclusions Mother-to-child transmission occurred less frequently than expected without the use of HBIg. Adding HBIg and/or maternal antiviral prophylaxis may have prevented some of these infections. The observation of unsatisfactory levels of anti-HBs antibodies in 9% of the uninfected infants at 6 months highlights the need for improvement of the universal immunization procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2942257813,"Background In the literature-based discovery, considerable research has been done based on the ABC model developed by Swanson. ABC model hypothesizes that there is a meaningful relation between entity A extracted from document set 1 and entity C extracted from document set 2 through B entities that appear commonly in both document sets. The results of ABC model are relations among entity A, B, and C, which is referred as paths. A path allows for hypothesizing the relationship between entity A and entity C, or helps discover entity B as a new evidence for the relationship between entity A and entity C. The co-occurrence based approach of ABC model is a well-known approach to automatic hypothesis generation by creating various paths. However, the co-occurrence based ABC model has a limitation, in that biological context is not considered. It focuses only on matching of B entity which commonly appears in relation between two entities. Therefore, the paths extracted by the co-occurrence based ABC model tend to include a lot of irrelevant paths, meaning that expert verification is essential. Methods In order to overcome this limitation of the co-occurrence based ABC model, we propose a context-based approach to connecting one entity relation to another, modifying the ABC model using biological contexts. In this study, we defined four biological context elements: cell, drug, disease, and organism. Based on these biological context, we propose two extended ABC models: a context-based ABC model and a context-assignment-based ABC model. In order to measure the performance of the both proposed models, we examined the relevance of the B entities between the well-known relations “APOE–MAPT” as well as “FUS–TARDBP”. Each relation means interaction between neurodegenerative disease associated with proteins. The interaction between APOE and MAPT is known to play a crucial role in Alzheimer’s disease as APOE affects tau-mediated neurodegeneration. It has been shown that mutation in FUS and TARDBP are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS), a motor neuron disease by leading to neuronal cell death. Using these two relations, we compared both of proposed models to co-occurrence based ABC model. Results The precision of B entities by co-occurrence based ABC model was 27.1% for “APOE–MAPT” and 22.1% for “FUS–TARDBP”, respectively. In context-based ABC model, precision of extracted B entities was 71.4% for “APOE–MAPT”, and 77.9% for “FUS–TARDBP”. Context-assignment based ABC model achieved 89% and 97.5% precision for the two relations, respectively. Both proposed models achieved a higher precision than co-occurrence-based ABC model."
https://openalex.org/W2942475259,"Positive feelings about work and family responsibilities benefit psychological well-being, but their physical health effects remain unexplored. The study assessed whether meaningful work and reward from taking care of family benefitted physical health to the same degree as mental health. Participants were 181 Danes aged 49–51. Participants reported on working conditions, providing care to family, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. Physical health was operationalized as a physiological dysregulation (e.g., hypertension, high levels of blood sugar and cholesterol, high body mass index). A multidimensional index of physiological dysregulation was created using parameters of cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune function. As expected, meaningful work and sense of reward from taking care of family members were associated with better mental health. However, in women, the very same factors were positively associated with higher physiological dysregulation. We conclude that work and family factors promoting psychological well-being may have physical health trade-offs, particularly in women."
https://openalex.org/W2940707874,"Animals housed in naturalistic social groups with access to automated cognitive testing vary in whether and how much they participate in cognitive testing. Understanding how demographic, seasonal, and social factors relate to participation is essential to evaluating the usefulness of these systems for studying cognition and in assessing the data produced. We evaluated how sex, age, reproductive experience, seasonality, and rank related to patterns of participation in a naturalistic group of rhesus monkeys over a 4-year period. Females interacted with the touchscreen systems more than males and were more likely to complete initial training. Age was positively correlated with touchscreen activity through adolescence in females, at which point seasonality and reproductive experience were stronger associates of participation. While monkeys in different rank categories did not differ in how much they interacted with the touchscreen systems, monkeys of different ranks tended not to work at the same times, perhaps reflecting avoidance of high ranking animals by those of lower rank. Automated cognitive testing systems for naturalistic social groups of rhesus monkeys can yield quality cognitive data from individuals of all ages and ranks, but participation biases may make it difficult to study sex differences or seasonal variation in cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2942079222,"Rodents serve as reservoirs and/or vectors for several human infections of high morbidity and mortality in the tropics. Population growth and demographic shifts over the years have increased contact with these mammals, thereby increasing opportunities for disease transmission. In Africa, the burden of rodent-borne diseases is not well described. To investigate human seroprevalence of selected rodent-borne pathogens, sera from 657 healthy adults in ten rural communities in Ghana were analyzed. An in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to Lassa virus was positive in 34 (5%) of the human samples. Using commercial kits, antibodies to hantavirus serotypes, Puumala and Dobrava, and Leptospira bacteria were detected in 11%, 12% and 21% of the human samples, respectively. Forty percent of residents in rural farming communities in Ghana have measurable antibodies to at least one of the rodent-borne pathogens tested, including antibodies to viral hemorrhagic fever viruses. The high seroprevalence found in rural Ghana to rodent-borne pathogens associated with both sporadic cases and larger disease outbreaks will help define disease threats and inform public health policy to reduce disease burden in underserved populations and deter larger outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2950368526,"Colorful feathers have long been assumed to be conspicuous to predators, and hence likely to incur costs due to enhanced predation risk. However, many mammals that prey on birds have dichromatic visual systems with only two types of color-sensitive visual receptors, rather than the three and four photoreceptors characteristic of humans and most birds, respectively. Here, we use a combination of multispectral imaging, reflectance spectroscopy, color vision modelling and visual texture analysis to compare the visual signals available to conspecifics and to mammalian predators from multicolored feathers from the Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus), as well as red and yellow parrot feathers. We also model the effects of distance-dependent blurring due to visual acuity. When viewed by birds against green vegetation, most of the feathers studied are estimated to have color and brightness contrasts similar to values previously found for ripe fruit. On the other hand, for dichromat mammalian predators, visual contrasts for these feathers were only weakly detectable and often below detection thresholds for typical viewing distances. We also show that for dichromat mammal vision models, the peacock’s train has below-detection threshold color and brightness contrasts and visual textures that match various foliage backgrounds. These findings are consistent with many feathers of similar hue to those studied here being inconspicuous, and in some cases potentially cryptic, in the eyes of common mammalian predators of adult birds. Given that birds perform many conspicuous motions and behaviors, this study suggests that mammalian predators are more likely to use other sensory modalities (e.g., motion detection, hearing, and olfaction), rather than color vision, to detect avian prey. This suggests new directions for future behavioral studies and emphasizes the importance of understanding the influence of the sensory ecology of predators in the evolution of animal coloration."
https://openalex.org/W2942309221,"There has been significant uncertainty in the selection of candidates for cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). This report investigates the influence of site-specific metastases (bone, brain, liver, and lung) on the survival benefit of CN.Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2010-2014), 1113 mRCC patients treated with CN (n = 618) or no surgery (NS, n = 495) met the selection criteria. 168 pairs of patients using propensity scores were matched to balance the selection bias of undergoing CN. Multivariable competing risks regression analysis was used to calculate cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall survival (OS). Cases were subdivided to investigate the advantages of each procedure.Before or after matching, CN led to better OS and lower CSM in Kaplan-Meier analysis. In matched cohort, decreased CSM after CN compared to without CN were consistently found in most subgroups stratified by age, T stage, and patients with ≤2 site-specific metastases. However, patients with ≥ 3 site-specific metastases, or patients with ≥cT3 stage combined with ≥ 2 site-specific metastases were not benefit from the cytoreductive nephrectomy.The potential benefit of CN disappeared in patients with ≥ 3 site-specific metastases, or patients with ≥cT3 combined with ≥ 2 site-specific metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2941552938,"Information sharing can be regarded as a form of cooperative behavior protected by the work of a reputation system. Yet, deception in communication is common. The research examined the possibility that speakers use epistemic markers to preempt being seen as uncooperative even though they in fact are. Epistemic markers convey the speakers’ certainty and involvement in the acquisition of the information. When speakers present a lie as indirectly acquired or uncertain, they gain if the lie is believed and likely do not suffer if it is discovered. In our study, speakers of English and Italian (where epistemic markers were presented lexically) and of Estonian and Turkish (where they were presented grammatically through evidentials) had to imagine being a speaker in a conversation and choose a response to a question. The response options varied 1) the truth of the part of the response addressing the question at issue and 2) whether the epistemic marker indicated that the speaker had acquired the information directly or indirectly. Across languages, if participants chose to tell a lie, they were likely to present it with an indirect epistemic marker, thus providing evidence for preemptive action accompanying uncooperative behavior. For English and Italian participants, this preemptive action depended respectively on resource availability and relationship with the addressee, suggesting cultural variability in the circumstances that trigger it."
https://openalex.org/W2940761078,"In Streptomyces clavuligerus, the gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of the clinically used β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid contains a gene (orf12 or cpe) encoding a protein with a C-terminal class A β-lactamase-like domain. The cpe gene is essential for clavulanic acid production, and the recent crystal structure of its product (Cpe) was shown to also contain an N-terminal isomerase/cyclase-like domain, but the function of the protein remains unknown. In the current study, we show that Cpe is a cytoplasmic protein and that both its N- and C-terminal domains are required for in vivo clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus. Our results along with those from previous studies allude towards a biosynthetic role for Cpe during the later stages of clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus. Amino acids from Cpe essential for biosynthesis were also identified, including one (Lys89) from the recently described N-terminal isomerase-like domain of unknown function. Homologues of Cpe from other clavulanic acid-producing Streptomyces spp. were shown to be functionally equivalent to the S. clavuligerus protein, whereas those from non-producers containing clavulanic acid-like gene clusters were not. The suggested in vivo involvement of an isomerase-like domain recruited by an ancestral β-lactamase related protein, supports a previous hypothesis that Cpe could be involved in a step requiring the opening and modification of the clavulanic acid core during its biosynthesis from 5S precursors."

We used NST with PTC124 to determine if we could successfully rescue nonsense variants in human Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) in vitro and in a zebrafish bmp4 allele with a stop variant in vivo. We transfected 293T/17 cells with wildtype or mutant human BMP4 cDNA containing p.Arg198* and p.Glu213* and exposed cells to 0-20 μM PTC124. Treatment with 20 μM PTC124 produced a small, non-significant increase in BMP4 when targeting the p.Arg198* allele, but not the p.Glu213* allele, as measured with an In-cell ELISA assay. We then examined the ability of PTC124 to rescue the ventral tail fin defects associated with homozygosity for the p.Glu209* allele of bmp4 (bmp4st72/st72) in Danio rerio. We in-crossed bmp4st72/+ heterozygous fish and found a statistically significant increase in homozygous larvae without tail fin and ventroposterior defects, consistent with phenotypic rescue, after treatment of dechorionated larvae with 0.5 μM PTC124. We conclude that treatment with PTC124 can rescue bmp4 nonsense variants, but that the degree of rescue may depend on sequence specific factors and the amount of RNA transcript available for rescue. Our work also confirms that zebrafish show promise as a useful animal model for assessing the efficacy of PTC124 treatment on nonsense variants."
https://openalex.org/W2950295017,"Chemical hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data is naturally high dimensional and large. There are thus inherent manual trade-offs in acquisition time, and the quality of data. Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) developed by Green et al. [1] has been extensively studied as a method for noise removal in HSI data. It too, however entails a manual speed-accuracy trade-off, namely the process of manually selecting the relevant bands in the MNF space. This process currently takes roughly around a month's time for acquiring and pre-processing an entire TMA with acceptable signal to noise ratio. We present three approaches termed 'Fast MNF', 'Approx MNF' and 'Rand MNF' where the computational time of the algorithm is reduced, as well as the entire process of band selection is fully automated. This automated approach is shown to perform at the same level of accuracy as MNF with now large speedup factors, resulting in the same task to be accomplished in hours. The different approximations produced by the three algorithms, show the reconstruction accuracy vs storage (50×) and runtime speed (60×) trade-off. We apply the approach for automating the denoising of different tissue histology samples, in which the accuracy of classification (differentiating between the different histologic and pathologic classes) strongly depends on the SNR (signal to noise ratio) of recovered data. Therefore, we also compare the effect of the proposed denoising algorithms on classification accuracy. Since denoising HSI data is done unsupervised, we also use a metric that assesses the quality of denoising in the image domain between the noisy and denoised image in the absence of ground truth."

https://openalex.org/W2940495582,"In the process of applying a plant protection product mixed with water (spray mixture) at the prescribed concentration with conventional sprayers for chemical protection of tree canopies in an orchard, standard models are used to express the dose rate of the plant protection product. Characteristic properties of the tree canopy in an orchard are not taken into consideration. Such models result in fixed quantities of spray mixture being sprayed through individual nozzles into a tree canopy. In this research work, an autonomous system is presented, which ensures a controlled quantity of spray mixture sprayed through the nozzles onto different tree canopy segments. The autonomous system is based on a fuzzy logic system (FLS) that includes information about the estimated leaf area to ensure more appropriate control of the spray mixture. An integral part of the FLS is a fuzzy logic controller for three electromagnetic valves operating in the pulse width mode and installed on the axial sprayer prototype. The results showed that, with the FLS, it was possible to control the quantity of spray mixture in the specific range depending on the estimated value of the leaf area, with a quantitative spray mixture average saving of 17.92%. For the phenological growth stage BBCH 91, this method represents a powerful tool for reducing the quantity of spray mixture for plant protection in the future."

Water accessibility, availability, and quality can have severe implications on health and safety, with those in urban areas often having more access. Key differences relating to water accessibility can be seen between the urban and peri-urban areas of Haiti. One major objective of this research is to examine the disparities between the two areas and determine limiting and enabling factors that are contributing to the perceived access to clean water. A cross-cultural household water insecurity experiences (HWISE) survey (n = 499) was distributed to determine barriers and accessibility to sufficient water quality and quantity at the household level. This paper explores the relationship between water insecurity between two urban and peri-urban communes in Haiti using this data. Fisher’s Exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to identify significant differences between strata, and logistic regression was used to determine significant associations with water security outcomes. Results indicated there were differences in both the costs and the sources of drinking and non-drinking water between urban and peri-urban Haiti. Certain demographic and behavioral characteristics were associated with increased water insecurity, including a household size greater than five and experiencing injury during collection."

The influence of nutrition on disease progression becomes more and more recognized. Protein intake by DMD patients may be insufficient to meet the increased demand of the constantly regenerating muscle fibers. This led to the hypothesis that improving protein uptake by the muscles could have therapeutic effects. The present study examined the effects of a modified diet, which composition might stimulate muscle growth, on disease pathology in the D2-mdx mouse model. D2-mdx males were fed with either a control diet or modified diet, containing high amounts of branched-chain amino acids, vitamin D3 and ursolic acid, for six weeks. Our study indicates that the modified diet could not ameliorate the muscle pathology. No effects on bodyweight or weight of individual muscles were observed. Neither did the diet affect severity of fibrosis or calcification of the muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2950928663,"1,3-Propanediol (1,3-PDO) is an important compound that is mainly used in industry for polymer production. Fermentation of 1,3-PDO from glycerol by Klebsiella pneumoniae is accompanied by formation of 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) as one of the main byproduct. The first step in the formation of 2,3-BDO from pyruvate is catalyzed by acetolactate synthase (ALS), an enzyme that competes with 1,3-PDO oxidoreductase for the cofactor NADH. This study aimed to analyze the impact of engineering the 2,3-BDO formation pathway via inactivation of ALS on 1,3-PDO fermentation by K. pneumoniae HSL4. An ALS mutant was generated using Red recombinase assisted gene replacement. The ALS specific activities of K. pneumoniae ΔALS were notably lower than that of the wild-type strain. Fed-batch fermentation of the mutant strain resulted in a 1,3-PDO concentration, productivity and conversion of 72.04 g L-1, 2.25 g L-1 h-1, and 0.41 g g-1, increase by 4.71%, 4.65% and 1.99% compared with the parent strain. Moreover, inactivation of ALS decreased meso-2,3-BDO formation to trace amounts, significantly increased 2S,3S-BDO and lactate production, and a pronounced redistribution of intracellular metabolic flux was apparent."

This paper contributes to the literature by assessing the importance of measuring neighbor mobility as well as neighborhood selection. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we examine the extent to which having longitudinal measures of ""neighbors"" shapes estimates of neighborhood effects, and also use a negative test of neighborhood effects to assess the importance of neighborhood selection. Specifically, we estimate similarity in self-rated health of adults over 30 years old who live in the same county over various periods of time and find that ""cross-sectional"" neighbor definitions may understate neighborhood effect estimates by as much as 35%. However, when we contrast these health estimates with contemporaneous neighborhood ""effects"" on completed education, we find that much of the ""understated"" effects on health are likely related to selection effects rather than causal effects of neighborhoods."
https://openalex.org/W2941819751,"Water and sanitation services are fundamental in preventing the spread of waterborne and hygiene-related diseases. However, in developing countries, such as Haiti, access to clean water continues to pose major challenges despite efforts to improve quality and reduce distance. With Léogâne being the epicenter of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, there were dozens of interventions aimed to improve access to clean water, specifically well construction and use of water treatment strategies. Using the socioecological framework, this study collected qualitative data to supplement a household water insecurity experiences (HWISE) survey in order to fully understand the narratives around water in Léogâne (urban) and its neighboring commune Gressier (peri-urban). The inclusion criteria for this study was that the participant must be a resident of either site, at least 18 years or older, and a female. Only females were included in this study so that researchers could better understand how perceived water insecurity impacts reproductive health, specifically gynecological infections. This cross-sectional study yielded 61 total in-depth interviews using a semi-structured open ended questionnaire to allow participants the ability to elaborate. Results suggest that there are common misconceptions about water and reproductive health specifically that engaging in sexual intercourse in saltwater will not result in pregnancy. Relevant narratives among the two communes included water acquisition, use of water, and bathing practices, among several others. Through understanding the local Haitian perspective and practices that surround water insecurity, we can better tailor public health interventions to improve access to water, female hygiene practices, and ultimately lower and prevent disease transmission."
