https://openalex.org/W4237591687,"Little has been done in the study of these intriguing questions, and I do not wish to give the impression that any extensive set of ideas exists that could be called a ""theory."" What is quite surprising, as far as the histories of science and philosophy are concerned, is that the major impetus for the fantastic growth of interest in brain processes, both psychological and physiological, has come from a device, a machine, the digital computer. In dealing with a human being and a human society, we enjoy the luxury of being irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and incomplete, and yet of coping. In operating a computer, we must meet the rigorous requirements for detailed instructions and absolute precision. If we understood the ability of the human mind to make effective decisions when confronted by complexity, uncertainty, and irrationality then we could use computers a million times more effectively than we do. Recognition of this fact has been a motivation for the spurt of research in the field of neurophysiology. The more we study the information processing aspects of the mind, the more perplexed and impressed we become. It will be a very long time before we understand these processes sufficiently to reproduce them. In any case, the mathematician sees hundreds and thousands of formidable new problems in dozens of blossoming areas, puzzles galore, and challenges to his heart's content. He may never resolve some of these, but he will never be bored. What more can he ask?"
https://openalex.org/W4237059594,"Femtochemistry is concerned with the very act of the molecular motion that brings about chemistry, chemical bond breaking, or bond formation on the femtosecond (10(-15) second) time scale. With lasers it is now possible to record snapshots of chemical reactions with sub-angstrom resolution. This strobing of the transition-state region between reagents and products provides real time observations that are fundamental to understanding the dynamics of the chemical bond."
https://openalex.org/W2027703519,"The 1988 summer drought in the United States was the most extensive in many years. Because the drought developed in different places at different times, not all regional effects can be traced to the same cause. Along the West Coast and in the northwestern United States drought conditions developed during 1987 in association with the 1986 to 1987 El Niño in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Record low rainfalls from April to June 1988 led to rapid development of drought in the North Central United States. Strong anticyclonic conditions and a northward displaced jet stream in the upper atmosphere over North America throughout this period were only part of pronounced and distinctive wavetrain of anomalies in the atmospheric circulation that appeared to emanate from the tropical Pacific. Below average sea surface temperatures along the equator in the Pacific in the northern spring of 1988, combined with warmer than normal water from 10 degrees to 20 degrees N, led to a northward displaced but still active intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) southeast of Hawaii. Results from a steady-state planetarywave atmospheric model indicate that the atmospheric heating anomalies associated with the displaced ITCZ can force an anomalous wavetrain across North America similar to that observed. Land surface processes probably contributed to the severity and persistence of the drought; however, the large-scale atmospheric circulation perturbations associated with natural variations in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system in the tropical Pacific were most likely the primary cause."
https://openalex.org/W2036772574,"Atmospheric gases trapped in polar ice at the firn to ice transition layer are enriched in heavy isotopes (nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18) and in heavy gases (O(2)/N(2) and Ar/N(2) ratios) relative to the free atmosphere. The maximum enrichments observed follow patterns predicted for gravitational equilibrium at the base of the firn layer, as calculated from the depth to the transition layer and the temperature in the firn. Gas ratios exhibit both positive and negative enrichments relative to air: the negative enrichments of heavy gases are consistent with observed artifacts of vacuum stripping of gases from fractured ice and with the relative values of molecular diameters that govern capillary transport. These two models for isotopic and elemental fractionation provide a basis for understanding the initial enrichments of carbon-13 and oxygen-18 in trapped CO(2), CH(4), and O(2) in ice cores, which must be known in order to decipher ancient atmospheric isotopic ratios."

https://openalex.org/W1996794262,"Real-space images with atomic resolution of the BiO plane of Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8+delta) were obtained with a scanning tunneling microscope. Single-crystal samples were cleaved and imaged under ultrahigh vacuum conditions at room temperature. The images clearly show the one-dimensional incommensurate superstructure along the b-axis that is common to this phase. High-resolution images show the position of the Bi atoms, revealing the structural nature of the superlattice. A missing row of Bi atoms occurs either every nine or ten atomic sites in both (110) directions, accounting for the measured incommensurate periodicity of the superstructure. A model is proposed that includes missing rows of atoms, as well as displacements of the atomic positions along both the a- and c-axis directions."

The magnitude of the spacing decreased with increase in pH between 2.5 and 6.0. A t pH 2.5 40 milligrams of Namontmorillonite adsorbed 31 mg of fulvic acid; at pH 6.0, only 15.8 mg."
https://openalex.org/W2006462072,"On an artificial substrate of filter paper, Porcellio scaber cannot extract copper from leaf litter. If one increases the copper content of the food by soaking the leaves in solutions of CuSO(4) or in organic extracts, assimilation of copper becomes possible, but only at concentrations higher than 1 microgram of copper per milligram of ash. This is too high a level for primary vegetable matter to be considered a plausible source of copper for isopods. I present evidence that in fecal material the critical level at which assimilation of copper becomes feasible is lower than in primary organic material by nearly an order of magnitude, and that isopods are obliged to switch to coprophagy in order to allow accumulation of copper in their bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2074942422,"The recent development of beta gauges for the indirect determination of the water status of plants has had a widespread impact on plant ecological-physiological research. Calibration of these instruments has, however, been tedious and cumbersome, involving repeated simultaneous measurements of beta absorption and leaf water content. This procedure can be much simplified, as long as the beta absorption at a single known relative water content is measured, together with the turgid and dry weights of a sample of leaf discs."

https://openalex.org/W2046846873,"Cohenite [(Fe, Ni)(3)C] is found almost exclusively in meteorites containing from 6 to 8 percent nickel (by weight). On the basis of iron-nickel-carbon phase diagrams at 1 atmosphere and of kinetic data, the occurrence of cohenite within this narrow composition range as a low-pressure metastable phase and the nonoccurrence of cohenite in meteorites outside the range 6 to 8 percent nickel can be explained. Cohenite formed in meteorites containing less than 6 to 8 percent nickel decomposed to metal and graphite during cooling; it cannot form in meteorites containing more than about 8 percent. The presence of cohenite in meteorites cannot be used as an indicator of pressure of formation. However, the absence of cohenite in meteorites containing the assemblage, metal plus graphite, requires low pressures during cooling."
https://openalex.org/W2013272721,"A new hypothesis attributes the Martian ""wave of darkening"" to soil frost phenomena. Diurnal thawing and freezing of the ground, which uses moisture transported by the atmosphere from the melting polar cap, can produce various minute, frost-heaved, soil surface features. These microrelief features result in a complex porous surface structure, which causes optical darkening. The boundary at which the wave of darkening terminates on the winter hemisphere correlates with the latitude at which the diurnal peak surface temperature drops below 0°C. The hypothesis is examined in terms of known properties of the Martian atmosphere and surface and the availability of water."

https://openalex.org/W2004827623,"Prolonged exposures to acute anoxia caused progressive reductions in the viability of hydrated seeds of Prolific rye. For equal exposures of 9 days or longer, mortality was significantly higher in helium than in nitrogen. The findings suggest that prolonged use of helium as a component of atmospheres in manned space capsules may be harmful."

https://openalex.org/W2047228041,"The binary LP 101-15/16 having the proper motion of 1.62 seconds of arc per year has been studied with the prime-focus spectrograph of the 200-inch (508 cm) telescope. Indications are that LP 101-15/16 is the first pair of pygmy stars ever discovered. One of its components, LP 101-16, is probably a blue pygmy star which is at least four magnitudes fainter than the ordinary white dwarfs. Also, two of the Balmer lines in absorption appear to be displaced toward the red by amounts which indicate the existence of an Einstein gravitational red shift corresponding to about 1000 km sec-1. On the other hand LP 101-15 is red and shows an entirely new type of spectrum, which suggests that it may be a first representative of a type of red pygmy star which is 2.5 magnitudes fainter than the M-type dwarf stars of the main sequence."
