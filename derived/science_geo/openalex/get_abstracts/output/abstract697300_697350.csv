https://openalex.org/W4286488966,"The binding and catalytic functions of proteins are generally mediated by a small number of functional residues held in place by the overall protein structure. Here, we describe deep learning approaches for scaffolding such functional sites without needing to prespecify the fold or secondary structure of the scaffold. The first approach, ""constrained hallucination,"" optimizes sequences such that their predicted structures contain the desired functional site. The second approach, ""inpainting,"" starts from the functional site and fills in additional sequence and structure to create a viable protein scaffold in a single forward pass through a specifically trained RoseTTAFold network. We use these two methods to design candidate immunogens, receptor traps, metalloproteins, enzymes, and protein-binding proteins and validate the designs using a combination of in silico and experimental tests."
https://openalex.org/W4286488090,"Complex biological processes such as plant growth and development are often under the control of transcription factors that regulate the expression of large sets of genes and activate subordinate transcription factors in a cascade-like fashion. Here, by screening candidate photosynthesis-related transcription factors in rice, we identified a DREB (Dehydration Responsive Element Binding) family member, OsDREB1C, in which expression is induced by both light and low nitrogen status. We show that OsDREB1C drives functionally diverse transcriptional programs determining photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen utilization, and flowering time. Field trials with OsDREB1C -overexpressing rice revealed yield increases of 41.3 to 68.3% and, in addition, shortened growth duration, improved nitrogen use efficiency, and promoted efficient resource allocation, thus providing a strategy toward achieving much-needed increases in agricultural productivity."
https://openalex.org/W4286486889,"In many reactions restricted by water, selective removal of water from the reaction system is critical and usually requires a membrane reactor. We found that a simple physical mixture of hydrophobic poly(divinylbenzene) with cobalt-manganese carbide could modulate a local environment of catalysts for rapidly shipping water product in syngas conversion. We were able to shift the water-sorption equilibrium on the catalyst surface, leading to a greater proportion of free surface that in turn raised the rate of syngas conversion by nearly a factor of 2. The carbon monoxide conversion reached 63.5%, and 71.4% of the hydrocarbon products were light olefins at 250°C, outperforming poly(divinylbenzene)-free catalyst under equivalent reaction conditions. The physically mixed CoMn carbide/poly(divinylbenzene) catalyst was durable in the continuous test for 120 hours."
https://openalex.org/W4286488836,"To accelerate the translation of cancer nanomedicine, we used an integrated genomic approach to improve our understanding of the cellular processes that govern nanoparticle trafficking. We developed a massively parallel screen that leverages barcoded, pooled cancer cell lines annotated with multiomic data to investigate cell association patterns across a nanoparticle library spanning a range of formulations with clinical potential. We identified both materials properties and cell-intrinsic features that mediate nanoparticle-cell association. Using machine learning algorithms, we constructed genomic nanoparticle trafficking networks and identified nanoparticle-specific biomarkers. We validated one such biomarker: gene expression of SLC46A3 , which inversely predicts lipid-based nanoparticle uptake in vitro and in vivo. Our work establishes the power of integrated screens for nanoparticle delivery and enables the identification and utilization of biomarkers to rationally design nanoformulations."
https://openalex.org/W4286488145,"How locally adapted ecotypes are established and maintained within a species is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. Using forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus ), we characterized the genetic basis of variation in two defining traits—tail length and coat color—and discovered a 41-megabase chromosomal inversion linked to both. The inversion frequency is 90% in the dark, long-tailed forest ecotype; decreases across a habitat transition; and is absent from the light, short-tailed prairie ecotype. We implicate divergent selection in maintaining the inversion at frequencies observed in the wild, despite high levels of gene flow, and explore fitness benefits that arise from suppressed recombination within the inversion. We uncover a key role for a large, previously uncharacterized inversion in the evolution and maintenance of classic mammalian ecotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4286203220,"The adult zebrafish heart has a high capacity for regeneration following injury. However, the composition of the regenerative niche has remained largely elusive. Here, we dissected the diversity of activated cell states in the regenerating zebrafish heart based on single-cell transcriptomics and spatiotemporal analysis. We observed the emergence of several transient cell states with fibroblast characteristics following injury, and we outlined the proregenerative function of collagen-12-expressing fibroblasts. To understand the cascade of events leading to heart regeneration, we determined the origin of these cell states by high-throughput lineage tracing. We found that activated fibroblasts were derived from two separate sources: the epicardium and the endocardium. Mechanistically, we determined Wnt signalling as a regulator of the endocardial fibroblast response. In summary, our work identifies specialized activated fibroblast cell states that contribute to heart regeneration, thereby opening up possible approaches to modulating the regenerative capacity of the vertebrate heart."

https://openalex.org/W4286488468,"Species’ geographic ranges are limited by climate and species interactions. Climate is the prevailing explanation for why species live only within narrow elevational ranges in megadiverse biodiverse tropical mountains, but competition can also restrict species’ elevational ranges. We test contrasting predictions of these hypotheses by conducting a global comparative test of birds’ elevational range sizes within 31 montane regions, using more than 4.4 million citizen science records from eBird to define species’ elevational ranges in each region. We find strong support that competition, not climate, is the leading driver of narrow elevational ranges. These results highlight the importance of species interactions in shaping species’ ranges in tropical mountains, Earth’s hottest biodiversity hotspots."
https://openalex.org/W4286497619,"Most endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in mammals are incapable of retrotransposition; therefore, why ERV derepression is associated with lethality during early development has been a mystery. Here, we report that rapid and selective degradation of the heterochromatin adapter protein TRIM28 triggers dissociation of transcriptional condensates from loci encoding super-enhancer (SE)-driven pluripotency genes and their association with transcribed ERV loci in murine embryonic stem cells. Knockdown of ERV RNAs or forced expression of SE-enriched transcription factors rescued condensate localization at SEs in TRIM28-degraded cells. In a biochemical reconstitution system, ERV RNA facilitated partitioning of RNA polymerase II and the Mediator coactivator into phase-separated droplets. In TRIM28 knockout mouse embryos, single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed specific depletion of pluripotent lineages. We propose that coding and noncoding nascent RNAs, including those produced by retrotransposons, may facilitate 'hijacking' of transcriptional condensates in various developmental and disease contexts."

https://openalex.org/W4286493109,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with potential resistance to existing drugs emphasizes the need for new therapeutic modalities with broad variant activity. Here we show that ensovibep, a trispecific DARPin (designed ankyrin repeat protein) clinical candidate, can engage the three units of the spike protein trimer of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibit ACE2 binding with high potency, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy analysis. The cooperative binding together with the complementarity of the three DARPin modules enable ensovibep to inhibit frequent SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron sublineages BA.1 and BA.2. In Roborovski dwarf hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2, ensovibep reduced fatality similarly to a standard-of-care monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail. When used as a single agent in viral passaging experiments in vitro, ensovibep reduced the emergence of escape mutations in a similar fashion to the same mAb cocktail. These results support further clinical evaluation of ensovibep as a broad variant alternative to existing targeted therapies for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
https://openalex.org/W4286486134,"Semiconductors with high thermal conductivity and electron-hole mobility are of great importance for electronic and photonic devices as well as for fundamental studies. Among the ultrahigh–thermal conductivity materials, cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) is predicted to exhibit simultaneously high electron and hole mobilities of &gt;1000 centimeters squared per volt per second. Using the optical transient grating technique, we experimentally measured thermal conductivity of 1200 watts per meter per kelvin and ambipolar mobility of 1600 centimeters squared per volt per second at the same locations on c-BAs samples at room temperature despite spatial variations. Ab initio calculations show that lowering ionized and neutral impurity concentrations is key to achieving high mobility and high thermal conductivity, respectively. The high ambipolar mobilities combined with the ultrahigh thermal conductivity make c-BAs a promising candidate for next-generation electronics."
https://openalex.org/W4286486928,"Semiconducting cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has been predicted to have carrier mobility of 1400 square centimeters per volt-second for electrons and 2100 square centimeters per volt-second for holes at room temperature. Using pump-probe transient reflectivity microscopy, we monitored the diffusion of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal c-BAs to obtain their mobility. With near-bandgap 600-nanometer pump pulses, we found a high ambipolar mobility of 1550 ± 120 square centimeters per volt-second, in good agreement with theoretical prediction. Additional experiments with 400-nanometer pumps on the same spot revealed a mobility of &gt;3000 square centimeters per volt-second, which we attribute to hot electrons. The observation of high carrier mobility, in conjunction with high thermal conductivity, enables an enormous number of device applications for c-BAs in high-performance electronics and optoelectronics."
https://openalex.org/W4286488868,"There is wide interest in developing accurate theories for predicting rates of chemical reactions that occur at metal surfaces, especially for applications in industrial catalysis. Conventional methods contain many approximations that lack experimental validation. In practice, there are few reactions where sufficiently accurate experimental data exist to even allow meaningful comparisons to theory. Here, we present experimentally derived thermal rate constants for hydrogen atom recombination on platinum single-crystal surfaces, which are accurate enough to test established theoretical approximations. A quantum rate model is also presented, making possible a direct evaluation of the accuracy of commonly used approximations to adsorbate entropy. We find that neglecting the wave nature of adsorbed hydrogen atoms and their electronic spin degeneracy leads to a 10× to 1000× overestimation of the rate constant for temperatures relevant to heterogeneous catalysis. These quantum effects are also found to be important for nanoparticle catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W4286489053,"Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a neurotoxic natural product that is an indispensable probe in neuroscience, a biosynthetic and ecological enigma, and a celebrated target of synthetic chemistry. Here, we present a stereoselective synthesis of TTX that proceeds in 22 steps from a glucose derivative. The central cyclohexane ring of TTX and its α-tertiary amine moiety were established by the intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a nitrile oxide, followed by alkynyl addition to the resultant isoxazoline. A ruthenium-catalyzed hydroxylactonization set the stage for the formation of the dioxa-adamantane core. Installation of the guanidine, oxidation of a primary alcohol, and a late-stage epimerization gave a mixture of TTX and anhydro-TTX. This synthetic approach could give ready access to biologically active derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W4286494337,"Abstract The IL-17 family of cytokines and receptors have central roles in host defence against infection and development of inflammatory diseases 1 . The compositions and structures of functional IL-17 family ligand–receptor signalling assemblies remain unclear. IL-17E (also known as IL-25) is a key regulator of type 2 immune responses and driver of inflammatory diseases, such as allergic asthma, and requires both IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and IL-17RB to elicit functional responses 2 . Here we studied IL-25–IL-17RB binary and IL-25–IL-17RB–IL-17RA ternary complexes using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, single-molecule imaging and cell-based signalling approaches. The IL-25–IL-17RB–IL-17RA ternary signalling assembly is a C2-symmetric complex in which the IL-25–IL-17RB homodimer is flanked by two ‘wing-like’ IL-17RA co-receptors through a ‘tip-to-tip’ geometry that is the key receptor–receptor interaction required for initiation of signal transduction. IL-25 interacts solely with IL-17RB to allosterically promote the formation of the IL-17RB–IL-17RA tip-to-tip interface. The resulting large separation between the receptors at the membrane-proximal level may reflect proximity constraints imposed by the intracellular domains for signalling. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of IL-17A–IL-17RA and IL-17A–IL-17RA–IL-17RC complexes reveal that this tip-to-tip architecture is a key organizing principle of the IL-17 receptor family. Furthermore, these studies reveal dual actions for IL-17RA sharing among IL-17 cytokine complexes, by either directly engaging IL-17 cytokines or alternatively functioning as a co-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W4286492064,"We experimentally discovered and theoretically analyzed a photochemical mechanism, which we term proton-coupled energy transfer (PCEnT). A series of anthracene-phenol-pyridine triads formed a local excited anthracene state after light excitation at a wavelength of ~400 nanometers (nm), which led to ﬂuorescence around 550 nm from the phenol-pyridine unit. Direct excitation of phenol-pyridine would have required ~330-nm light, but the coupled proton transfer within the phenol-pyridine unit lowered its excited-state energy so that it could accept excitation energy from anthracene. Singlet-singlet energy transfer thus occurred despite the lack of spectral overlap between the anthracene ﬂuorescence and the phenol-pyridine absorption. Moreover, theoretical calculations indicated negligible charge transfer between the anthracene and phenol-pyridine units. We construe PCEnT as an elementary reaction of possible relevance to biological systems and future photonic devices."
https://openalex.org/W4286495730,"The HER2 receptor modulates downstream signaling by forming homodimers and heterodimers with other members of the HER family. For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, Trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody as first-line therapy has shown significant survival benefits. However, the development of acquired resistance to Trastuzumab continues to be a significant obstacle. TNF receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) upregulation was discovered to be associated with a worse clinical outcome. Here we identified TRAF4 overexpression as one of the putative mechanisms for HER2-positive breast cancer cells to maintain HER2 signaling during Trastuzumab treatment, while TRAF4 knockdown reduced HER2 stability and improved Trastuzumab sensitivity. Mechanistically, TRAF4 regulates HER2 level through its impact on SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase protein 2 (SMURF2). The development of a membrane-associated protein complex containing HER2, TRAF4, and SMURF2 has been observed. SMURF2 bound to the HER2 cytoplasmic domain, and directly ubiquitinated it leading to HER2 degradation, whereas TRAF4 stabilized HER2 by degrading SMURF2 and inhibiting the binding of SMURF2 to HER2. Moreover, downregulation of TRAF4 has decreased the AKT/mTOR signaling. In conclusion, we discovered a new HER2 signaling regulation that involves the TRAF4-SMURF2 complex, a possible mechanism that might contribute to anti-HER2 resistance, making TRAF4 a viable target for treating HER2 + breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W4286495492,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and SET domain bifurcated 1 (SETDB1, also known as ESET) are oncogenic methyltransferases implicated in a number of human cancers. These enzymes typically function as epigenetic repressors of target genes by methylating histone H3 K27 and H3-K9 residues, respectively. Here, we show that EZH2 and SETDB1 are essential to proliferation in 3 SCC cell lines, HSC-5, FaDu, and Cal33. Additionally, we find both of these proteins highly expressed in an aggressive stem-like SCC sub-population. Depletion of either EZH2 or SETDB1 disrupts these stem-like cells and their associated phenotypes of spheroid formation, invasion, and tumor growth. We show that SETDB1 regulates this SCC stem cell phenotype through cooperation with ΔNp63α, an oncogenic isoform of the p53-related transcription factor p63. Furthermore, EZH2 is upstream of both SETDB1 and ΔNp63α, activating these targets via repression of the tumor suppressor RUNX3. We show that targeting this pathway with inhibitors of EZH2 results in activation of RUNX3 and repression of both SETDB1 and ΔNp63α, antagonizing the SCC cancer stem cell phenotype. This work highlights a novel pathway that drives an aggressive cancer stem cell phenotype and demonstrates a means of pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4286500590,"Disaggregated population counts are needed to calculate health, economic, and development indicators in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), especially in settings of rapid urbanisation. Censuses are often outdated and inaccurate in LMIC settings, and rarely disaggregated at fine geographic scale. Modelled gridded population datasets derived from census data have become widely used by development researchers and practitioners; however, accuracy in these datasets are evaluated at the spatial scale of model input data which is generally courser than the neighbourhood or cell-level scale of many applications. We simulate a realistic synthetic 2016 population in Khomas, Namibia, a majority urban region, and introduce several realistic levels of outdatedness (over 15 years) and inaccuracy in slum, non-slum, and rural areas. We aggregate the synthetic populations by census and administrative boundaries (to mimic census data), resulting in 32 gridded population datasets that are typical of LMIC settings using the WorldPop-Global-Unconstrained gridded population approach. We evaluate the cell-level accuracy of these gridded population datasets using the original synthetic population as a reference. In our simulation, we found large cell-level errors, particularly in slum cells. These were driven by the averaging of population densities in large areal units before model training. Age, accuracy, and aggregation of the input data also played a role in these errors. We suggest incorporating finer-scale training data into gridded population models generally, and WorldPop-Global-Unconstrained in particular (e.g., from routine household surveys or slum community population counts), and use of new building footprint datasets as a covariate to improve cell-level accuracy (as done in some new WorldPop-Global-Constrained datasets). It is important to measure accuracy of gridded population datasets at spatial scales more consistent with how the data are being applied, especially if they are to be used for monitoring key development indicators at neighbourhood scales within cities."
https://openalex.org/W4286489707,"Although insecticide formulations and spray rates are optimized to achieve lethal exposure, there are many factors in agricultural settings that can reduce the effective exposure of insect pests. These include weather patterns, timing of application, chemical degradation/volatilization, plant structural complexity, and resistant populations. While sub-lethal exposure to insecticides can still have negative impacts on pest populations, they can also lead to stimulatory, or hormetic, responses that can increase the fitness of surviving insects. Sub-lethal concentrations may also produce increased tolerance in the offspring of surviving adults through transgenerational effects. Sub-lethal effects are pertinent for the invasive fruit pest, spotted-wing Drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), because its small size, diurnal movement patterns, and utilization of hosts with complex plant structures, such as caneberries and blueberries, make effective insecticide applications tenuous. In this study, we measured spotted-wing Drosophila survivorship, reproductive performance, and offspring tolerance in flies exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of three commonly-used insecticides (zeta-cypermethrin, spinetoram, and pyrethrin). We found some evidence for hormesis, with survival effects being sex- and concentration-dependent for all insecticides. Males were far more susceptible to insecticides than females, which in some cases exhibited higher eclosion success and reproductive rates when exposed to sub-lethal doses. We did not observe significant transgenerational effects at sub-lethal concentrations, despite trends of increased offspring viability for zeta-cypermethrin and spinetoram. More research, however, is needed to fully understand the role that sub-lethal effects may play in pest population dynamics, insecticide efficacy, and the development of genetic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4285807453,"Immediate early genes (IEGs) are transcribed in response to neuronal activity from sensory stimulation during multiple adaptive processes in the brain. The transcriptional profile of IEGs is indicative of the duration of neuronal activity, but its sensitivity to the strength of depolarization remains unknown. Also unknown is whether activity history of graded potential changes influence future neuronal activity. In this work with dissociated rat cortical neurons, we found that mild depolarization-mediated by elevated extracellular potassium (K+)-induces a wide array of rapid IEGs and transiently depresses transcriptional and signaling responses to a successive stimulus. This latter effect was independent of de novo transcription, translation, and signaling via calcineurin or mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, as measured by multiple electrode arrays and calcium imaging, mild depolarization acutely subdues subsequent spontaneous and bicuculline-evoked activity via calcium- and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent mechanisms. Collectively, this work suggests that a recent history of graded potential changes acutely depress neuronal intrinsic properties and subsequent responses. Such effects may have several potential downstream implications, including reducing signal-to-noise ratio during synaptic plasticity processes."
https://openalex.org/W4285806646,"Knockout of the transcription factor X-box binding protein (XBP1) is known to decrease liver glucose production and lipogenesis. However, whether insulin can regulate gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis through XBP1 and how insulin activates the inositol-requiring enzyme-XBP1 ER stress pathway remains unexplored. Here, we report that in the fed state, insulin-activated kinase AKT directly phosphorylates inositol-requiring enzyme 1 at S724, which in turn mediates the splicing of XBP1u mRNA, thus favoring the generation of the spliced form, XBP1s, in the liver of mice. Subsequently, XBP1s stimulate the expression of lipogenic genes and upregulates liver lipogenesis as previously reported. Intriguingly, we find that fasting leads to an increase in XBP1u along with a drastic decrease in XBP1s in the liver of mice, and XBP1u, not XBP1s, significantly increases PKA-stimulated CRE reporter activity in cultured hepatocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of XBP1u significantly increases cAMP-stimulated expression of rate-limiting gluconeogenic genes, G6pc and Pck1, and glucose production in primary hepatocytes. Reexpression of XBP1u in the liver of mice with XBP1 depletion significantly increases fasting blood glucose levels and gluconeogenic gene expression. These data support an important role of XBP1u in upregulating gluconeogenesis in the fasted state. Taken together, we reveal that insulin signaling via AKT controls the expression of XBP1 isoforms and that XBP1u and XBP1s function in different nutritional states to regulate liver gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, respectively."

Missense mutations in OGT segregate with a novel X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, the OGT congenital disorder of glycosylation (OGT-CDG). One hypothesis for the etiology of OGT-CDG is that loss of OGT activity leads to hypo-O-GlcNAcylation of as yet unidentified, specific neuronal proteins, affecting essential embryonic, and postnatal neurodevelopmental processes; however, the identity of these O-GlcNAcylated proteins is not known. Here, we used bioinformatic techniques to integrate sequence conservation, structural data, clinical data, and the available literature to identify 22 candidate proteins that convey OGT-CDG. We found using gene ontology and PANTHER database data that these candidate proteins are involved in diverse processes including Ras/MAPK signaling, translational repression, cytoskeletal dynamics, and chromatin remodeling. We also identify pathogenic missense variants at O-GlcNAcylation sites that segregate with intellectual disability. This work establishes a preliminary platform for the mechanistic dissection of the links between protein O-GlcNAcylation and neurodevelopment in OGT-CDG."
https://openalex.org/W4285807805,"The chloride intracellular channel-4 (CLIC4) is one of the six highly conserved proteins in the CLIC family that share high structural homology with GST-omega in the GST superfamily. While CLIC4 is a multifunctional protein that resides in multiple cellular compartments, the discovery of its enzymatic glutaredoxin-like activity in vitro suggested that it could function as an antioxidant. Here, we found that deleting CLIC4 from murine 6DT1 breast tumor cells using CRISPR enhanced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and sensitized cells to apoptosis in response to H2O2 as a ROS-inducing agent. In intact cells, H2O2 increased the expression of both CLIC4 mRNA and protein. In addition, increased superoxide production in 6DT1 cells lacking CLIC4 was associated with mitochondrial hyperactivity including increased mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial organelle enlargement. In the absence of CLIC4, however, H2O2-induced apoptosis was associated with low expression and degradation of the antiapoptotic mitochondrial protein Bcl2 and the negative regulator of mitochondrial ROS, UCP2. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling of H2O2-treated control and CLIC4-null cells revealed upregulation of genes associated with ROS-induced apoptosis and downregulation of genes that sustain mitochondrial functions. Accordingly, tumors that formed from transplantation of CLIC4-deficient 6DT1 cells were highly necrotic. These results highlight a critical role for CLIC4 in maintaining redox-homeostasis and mitochondrial functions in 6DT1 cells. Our findings also raise the possibility of targeting CLIC4 to increase cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs that are based on elevating ROS in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W4285808590,"La-related protein 1 (LARP1) has been identified as a key translational inhibitor of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs downstream of the nutrient sensing protein kinase complex, mTORC1. LARP1 exerts this inhibitory effect on TOP mRNA translation by binding to the mRNA cap and the adjacent 5'TOP motif, resulting in the displacement of the cap-binding protein eIF4E from TOP mRNAs. However, the involvement of additional signaling pathway in regulating LARP1-mediated inhibition of TOP mRNA translation is largely unexplored. In the present study, we identify a second nutrient sensing kinase GCN2 that converges on LARP1 to control TOP mRNA translation. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), an effector of GCN2 in nutrient stress conditions, in WT and GCN2 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we determined that LARP1 is a GCN2-dependent transcriptional target of ATF4. Moreover, we identified GCN1, a GCN2 activator, participates in a complex with LARP1 on stalled ribosomes, suggesting a role for GCN1 in LARP1-mediated translation inhibition in response to ribosome stalling. Therefore, our data suggest that the GCN2 pathway controls LARP1 activity via two mechanisms: ATF4-dependent transcriptional induction of LARP1 mRNA and GCN1-mediated recruitment of LARP1 to stalled ribosomes."

From year 2014 to 2019, 167 eyes of 167 patients of treatment naïve m-CNV were enrolled. 59 and 108 eyes were treated with intra-vitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab mono-therapy, respectively. Recurrence was defined as re-appearance of CNV activity, confirmed on optical coherence tomography (OCT) after at least 3 months of cessation of anti-VEGF therapy. Incidence of recurrence, predictors and re-treatment outcomes were studied.Overall, mean age and spherical equivalence (SE) was 47.95 ± 14.72 years and -12.19 ± 4.93 D respectively. Males constituted 50.9%. 44 eyes (26.4%) had a recurrence during a mean follow up of 16.5 ± 12.86 months. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the risk of recurrence was 8, 26 and, 33.6% at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. Age (p = 0.511), gender (p = 0.218), SE (p = 0.092), anti-VEGF (p = 0.629) and baseline BCVA (p = 0.519) did not influence recurrence. Number of injections administered to control the disease in the first episode was the only significant predictor of recurrence (Cox Proportional Hazard Ratio 2.89-3.07, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.28-7.45; p = 0.005). At 12 months, eyes requiring one injection in first episode had a recurrence rate of 12% versus 45% in eyes requiring 3 or more injections in the first episode. A mean number of 1.9 additional injections per eye was needed during re-treatment. Final BCVA in the recurrence group was similar to that of non-recurrence group (0.53 ± 0.40 versus 0.55 ± 0.36 LogMAR; p = 0.755). Baseline BCVA (p = 0.0001) was the only predictor of final visual outcome irrespective of anti-VEGF drug (p = 0.38).Eyes requiring greater number of injections for disease control in first episode are ""at risk"" of early m-CNV recurrence. However, recurrence does not adversely affect visual outcome, if treated adequately."
https://openalex.org/W4285806021,"Rab22 and Rab31 belong to the Rab5 subfamily of GTPases that regulates endocytic traffic and endosomal sorting. Rab22 and Rab31 (a.k.a. Rab22b) are closely related and share 87% amino acid sequence similarity, but they show distinct intracellular localization and function in the cell. Rab22 is localized to early endosomes and regulates early endosomal recycling, while Rab31 is mostly localized to the Golgi complex with only a small fraction in the endosomes at steady state. The specific determinants that affect this differential localization, however, are unclear. In this study, we identify a novel membrane targeting domain (MTD) consisting of the C-terminal hypervariable domain (HVD), interswitch loop (ISL), and N-terminal domain as a major determinant of endosomal localization for Rab22 and Rab31, as well as Rab5. Rab22 and Rab31 share the same N-terminal domain, but we find Rab22 chimeras with Rab31 HVD exhibit phenotypic Rab31 localization to the Golgi complex, while Rab31 chimeras with the Rab22 HVD localize to early endosomes, similar to wildtype Rab22. We also find that the Rab22 HVD favors interaction with the early endosomal effector protein Rabenosyn-5, which may stabilize the Rab localization to the endosomes. The importance of effector interaction in endosomal localization is further demonstrated by the disruption of Rab22 endosomal localization in Rabenosyn-5 knockout cells and by the shift of Rab31 to the endosomes in Rabenosyn-5-overexpressing cells. Taken together, we have identified a novel MTD that mediates localization of Rab5 subfamily members to early endosomes via interaction with an effector such as Rabenosyn-5."
https://openalex.org/W4285808270,"The synthesis of proinflammatory leukotrienes implicated in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atherosclerosis is initiated by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). The crystal structure of human Stable-5-LOX revealed a conformation where the catalytic iron was inaccessible to bulk solvent as two aromatic residues on a conserved helix-α2 (Hα2) plugged the substrate access portal. Whether 5-LOX can also adopt a more open conformation has not been resolved. Here, we present a new conformation of 5-LOX where Hα2 adopts an elongated conformation equivalent to that described in other animal lipoxygenase structures. Our observation of the sigmoidal kinetic behavior of 5-LOX, which is indicative of positive cooperativity, is consistent with a substrate-induced conformational change that shifts the ensemble of enzyme populations to favor the catalytically competent state. Strategic point mutations along Hα2 designed to unlock the closed conformation and elongate Hα2 resulted in improved kinetic parameters, altered limited proteolysis data, and a drastic reduction in the length of the lag phase yielding the most active Stable-5-LOX to date. Structural predictions by AlphaFold2 of these variants statistically favor an elongated Hα2 and reinforce a model in which improved kinetic parameters correlate with a more readily adopted open conformation. Taken together, these data provide valuable insights into the synthesis of leukotrienes."

The objective of this study was to examine the association of statins with renal disease progression, ophthalmic manifestations, and neurological manifestations in diabetes.This is a retrospective cohort study, new-user active comparator design, that included a national Veterans Health Administration (VA) patients with diabetes from 2003 to 2015. Patients were age 30 years or older and were regular users of the VA with data encompassing clinical encounters, demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, and medications. Patients were divided into statin users or nonusers (active comparators). Statin users initiated statins and nonusers initiated H2-blockers or proton pump-inhibitors (H2-PPI) as an active comparator. Study outcomes were: 1) Composite renal disease progression outcome; 2) Incident diabetes with ophthalmic manifestations; and 3) Incident diabetes with neurological manifestations.Out of 705,774 eligible patients, we propensity score matched 81,146 pairs of statin users and active comparators. Over a mean (standard deviation) of follow up duration of 4.8 (3) years, renal disease progression occurred in 9.5% of statin users vs 8.3% of nonusers (odds ratio [OR]: 1.16; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.12-1.20), incident ophthalmic manifestations in 2.7% of statin users vs 2.0% of nonusers (OR: 1.35, 95%CI:1.27-1.44), and incident neurological manifestations in 6.7% of statin users vs 5.7% of nonusers (OR: 1.19, 95%CI:1.15-1.25). Secondary, sensitivity, and post-hoc analyses were consistent and demonstrated highest risks among the healthier subgroup and those with intensive lowering of LDL-cholesterol.Statin use in patients with diabetes was associated with modestly higher risk of renal disease progression, incident ophthalmic, and neurological manifestations. More research is needed to assess the overall harm/benefit balance for statins in the lower risk populations with diabetes and those who receive intensive statin therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4286208108,"The systematic monitoring of private communications through the use of information technology pervades the digital age. One result of this is the potential availability of vast amount of data tracking the characteristics of mobile network users. Such data is becoming increasingly accessible for commercial use, while the accessibility of such data raises questions about the degree to which personal information can be protected. Existing regulations may require the removal of personally-identifiable information (PII) from datasets before they can be processed, but research now suggests that powerful machine learning classification methods are capable of targeting individuals for personalized marketing purposes, even in the absence of PII. This study aims to demonstrate how machine learning methods can be deployed to extract demographic characteristics. Specifically, we investigate whether key demographics-gender and age-of mobile users can be accurately identified by third parties using deep learning techniques based solely on observations of the user's interactions within the network. Using an anonymized dataset from a Latin American country, we show the relative ease by which PII in terms of the age and gender demographics can be inferred; specifically, our neural networks model generates an estimate for gender with an accuracy rate of 67%, outperforming decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting models by a significant margin. Neural networks achieve an even higher accuracy rate of 78% in predicting the subscriber age. These results suggest the need for a more robust regulatory framework governing the collection of personal data to safeguard users from predatory practices motivated by fraudulent intentions, prejudices, or consumer manipulation. We discuss in particular how advances in machine learning have chiseled away a number of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) articles designed to protect consumers from the imminent threat of privacy violations."
https://openalex.org/W4286490949,"The relationship between fish eating habits and menstrual pain is unknown. Elucidating this relationship can inform dietary guidance for reproductive age women with menstrual pain. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between fish intake frequency/preference and menstrual pain. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Miyagi Regional Center as an adjunct study of the Japan Environment and Children’s Study, and 2060 eligible women (mean age, 31.9 years) participated. Fish intake frequency (“&lt; 1 time/week,” “1 time/week,” “2–3 times/week,” or “≥ 4 times/week”), preference (“like,” “neutral,” or “dislike”), and menstrual pain (no/mild or moderate-to-severe) were assessed at 1.5 years after the last delivery through self-administered questionnaires. The association between fish intake frequency/preference and prevalence of moderate-to-severe menstrual pain was evaluated through logistic regression analyses. Our results show that, compared with the “&lt; 1 time/week” (38.0%) group, the “1 time/week” (26.9%), “2–3 times/week” (27.8%), and “≥ 4 times/week” (23.9%) groups showed a lower prevalence of moderate-to-severe menstrual pain ( p &lt; 0.01). The prevalence of moderate-to-severe menstrual pain was 27.7%, 27.6%, and 34.4% in the “like,” “neutral,” and “dislike” groups, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that frequent fish intake was associated with a lower prevalence of moderate-to-severe menstrual pain (“1 time/week”: odds ratio [OR] = 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41–0.86, “2–3 times/week”: OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45–0.90 and “≥ 4 times/week”: OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34–0.80; trend p = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression showed no association between fish preference and moderate-to-severe menstrual pain (“dislike” vs “like”: OR = 1.16; 95% CI, 0.78–1.73). There was a significant negative association between fish intake frequency and menstrual pain. It is suggested that fish intake can reduce or prevent menstrual pain."

According to the classification criteria of each index, a single-index unascertained measure function is constructed, and the unascertained measure of each index is calculated. The index weight is determined by the entropy weight method, the bid evaluation grade is determined by credible degree recognition criteria, superiority ranking is carried out, and the optimal result is obtained. Finally, an actual case study is used to verify the validity and practicability of the model. This case study shows that the model is an organic combination of the entropy weight method and unascertained measure theory and can provide a new idea for bid evaluation of renovation projects."
https://openalex.org/W4286497654,"To investigate the: (1) role of basic muscle pain sensitivity and psychological factors in the prediction of movement-evoked pain (MEP) following delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and (2) association of MEP with changes in systemic muscle pain sensitivity following DOMS induction.Fifty-one participants were assigned to either eccentric resistance exercise or control groups. They completed questionnaires evaluating psychological distress and underwent muscle pain sensitivity evaluation by the pressure pain threshold (PPT) test at the exercised and remote muscles, before and 24 hours following the intervention. MEP intensity was determined in response to lifting a 3kg canister using a visual analogue scale (VAS).The exercise group demonstrated MEP intensity of 5/10 on VAS and reduced PPTs at the main exercised muscle (p<0.001). A regression tree analyses revealed that the level of anxiety trait predicted a higher MEP intensity. A secondary analysis showed that 53% participants who were DOMS responders (MEP > mild intensity; ≥ 3/10 VAS) exhibited decreased PPTs in the exercised (p<0.001) and remote (p = 0.027) muscles following eccentric exercise. Characterization of DOMS responders revealed that, at baseline, they had lower PPTs in the exercised (p = 0.004) and remote (p = 0.001) muscles and reported higher psychological distress i.e., anxiety trait and depression symptoms (p<0.05), compared to non-responders. A regression analysis revealed that lower PPT or high levels of anxiety trait increased the probability to become a responder (p = 0.001).Susceptibility to MEP following DOMS is determined by muscle pain hypersensitivity and high levels of anxiety trait. MEP at the early stage of DOMS is linked with an increase in systemic muscle pain sensitivity suggestive of central mechanisms. This knowledge is valuable in translating science into clinical musculoskeletal pain management."
https://openalex.org/W4286498374,"The ecological model has been widely used to help researchers understand the multiple influences in the physical activity (PA) and in the sedentary behaviors in isolated forms. To date, few correlates concerning the behavioral groupings of PA and sedentary behaviors have been studied. In this context, this study aimed to identify movement behaviors’ latent classes related to the different adolescents’ PA and sedentary time expressions, as well as their associations with individual, sociodemographic, family, and environmental correlates. This is a cross-sectional study with 309 students aged between 14 and 16. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify movement behavior classes based on light PA, moderate to vigorous PA, number of steps, sedentary time, and screen time (ST). An accelerometer was used to evaluate movement behaviors. The individual, sociodemographic, family, and environmental correlates were assessed by questionnaires. Three classes were identified: Class 1, ""Active and Non-Sedentary"" (8.10% of the sample), Class 2, ""Active and Sedentary"" (28.5%), and Class 3, ""Inactive and Sedentary"" (63.4%). Those with low fruit intake, low aerobic fitness, stressed and whose head of the family obtained an ‘elementary school’ level education were, respectively, 7.17, 3.59, 3.56, and 4.40 times more likely to belong to class 3 than class 1. Those with medium and high socioeconomic status were 82% and 83% less likely to belong to class 1 than classes 2 and 3, respectively. Adolescents who perceived the neighborhoods with the best access to diversified land use, street connectivity, walking/pedaling ease, and traffic safety attributes, were 84%, 85%, 82%, and 82%, respectively less likely to belong to class 1 than class 2. It is concluded that distinct correlates can be associated with the movement behaviors classes."
https://openalex.org/W4285809448,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of the coronavirus family, is the pathogen responsible for transmissible gastroenteritis, which results in mitochondrial dysfunction in host cells. Previously, we identified 123 differentially expressed circular RNAs (cRNA)from the TGEV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cell line jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2). Previous bioinformatics analysis suggested that, of these, circBIRC6 had the potential to regulate mitochondrial function. Furthermore, mitochondrial permeability transition, a key step in the process of mitochondrial dysfunction, is known to be caused by abnormal opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs) regulated by the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC)-Cyclophilin D (CypD) complex. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of circBIRC6-2 on mitochondrial dysfunction and opening of mPTPs. We found that TGEV infection reduced circBIRC6-2 levels, which in turn reduced mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) levels, the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, and opening of mPTPs. In addition, we also identified ORFs and internal ribosomal entrance sites within the circBIRC6-2 RNA. We demonstrate circBIRC6-2 encodes a novel protein, BIRC6-236aa, which we show inhibits TGEV-induced opening of mPTPs during TGEV infection. Mechanistically, we identified an interaction between BIRC6-236aa and VDAC1, suggesting that BIRC6-236aa destabilizes the VDAC1-CypD complex. Taken together, the results suggest that the novel protein BIRC6-236aa encoded by cRNA circBIRC6-2 inhibits mPTP opening and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction by interacting with VDAC1."

https://openalex.org/W4286489039,"The objective was to determine differences in microRNAs (miRNAs) counts in several tissues of calves challenged with Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) or with M. bovis and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Eight calves approximately 2 months of age were randomly assigned to three groups: Control (CT; n = 2), M. bovis (MB; n = 3), and Coinfection (CO; n = 3). On day 0, calves in CO were intranasally challenged with BVDV and calves in MB with M. bovis. On day 6, CO calves were challenged with M. bovis. Calves were euthanized 17 days post-challenge and serum (SER), white blood cells (WBC), liver (LIV), mesenteric (MLN) and tracheal-bronchial (TBLN) lymph nodes, spleen (SPL), and thymus (THY), were collected at necropsy. MiRNAs were extracted from each tissue from each calf. Significant (P< 0.01) differences in miRNAs expression were observed in SER, LIV, MLN, TBLN, SPL, and THY. There were no significant (P> 0.05) miRNAs in WBC. In SER, the CO group had levels of miR-1343-3p significantly higher than the CT and MB groups (P = 0.0071). In LIV and SPL, the CO group had the lowest counts for all significant miRNAs compared to CT and MB. In TBLN, the CT group had the highest counts of miRNAs, compared to MB and CO, in 14 of the 21 significant miRNAs. In THY, the CO group had the highest counts, in 4 of the 6 significant miRNAs compared to CT and MB. BVDV was associated with reduction of miRNAs in LIV, SPL, MLN, and TBLN, and M. bovis reduced counts of miRNAs in only TBLN. Measuring circulating miRNAs to assess disease condition or to develop intervention strategies to minimize respiratory diseases in cattle caused by BVDV or M. bovis will be of limited use unless an alternative approach is developed to use them as indicators of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4286490112,"The one-sample log-rank test is the method of choice for single-arm Phase II trials with time-to-event endpoint. It allows to compare the survival of the patients to a reference survival curve that typically represents the expected survival under standard of care. The classical one-sample log-rank test, however, assumes that the reference survival curve is deterministic. This ignores that the reference curve is commonly estimated from historic data and thus prone to statistical error. Ignoring sampling variability of the reference curve results in type I error rate inflation. For that reason, a new one-sample log-rank test is proposed that explicitly accounts for the statistical error made in the process of estimating the reference survival curve. The test statistic and its distributional properties are derived using martingale techniques in the large sample limit. In particular, a sample size formula is provided. Small sample properties regarding type I and type II error rate control are studied by simulation. A case study is conducted to study the influence of several design parameters of a single-armed trial on the inflation of the type I error rate when reference curve sampling variability is ignored."
https://openalex.org/W4286494052,"Central retinal arteriolar (CRAE) and venular (CRVE) diameter equivalents are predictive for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the inter- and intraobserver variability for the assessment of CRAE and CRVE in mice using fluorescein contrast enhancement as compared to crude analysis.Three high quality images with (F) and without fluorescein (NF) of eight mice (type C57BL) were recorded and analysed by two independent experienced investigators to investigate interobserver variability. In addition, one investigator analysed 20 F and 20 NF images twice to investigate intraobserver variability. The time course of CRAE and CRVE vessel responses after fluorescein injection were recorded in one mouse every 30 seconds for 15 minutes.The interobserver variability was lower in F images compared to NF images for CRAE (r = 0.99, p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.65, p = 0.083) and CRVE (r = 0.99, p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.79, p = 0.019). Intraobserver variability for CRAE (r = 0.99, p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.48, p = 0.032) and CRVE (r = 0.98, p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.86, p < 0.001) were lower in F compared to NF images. Fluorescein injection induced vascular staining mimicking vessel dilation (+14%) followed by a long-lasting stable staining phase well suited for precise measurements.Measurement variability can be optimized by use of fluorescein as contrast enhancement in mice. Standardization for time of image acquisition after fluorescein injection is advisable. Translation of static retinal vessel analysis into a rodent model has the potential to bridge the research gap between proof of concept studies in animals and clinical studies in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4286494270,"Many countries including Ghana and Australia have adopted physical activity (PA) counselling in healthcare as a public health improvement strategy. Even so, more evidence is needed to improve clinical PA counselling among clinicians, including nurses. This study examined the association between nurses' physical activity counselling (NPAC) and patients' perceptions of care quality. The study adopted a cross-sectional design with a sensitivity analysis against potential confounding. The setting of the study was a public primary care facility in Darkuman, Accra. Participants were 605 patients in wards and the Outpatient Department of the facility. Data were collected using a self-reported questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to select potential confounding variables for the study. The study found that higher care quality was associated with larger scores of NPAC (β = 0.34; CR = 8.65; p = 0.000). NPAC has no significant direct association with patient satisfaction (β = 0.01; CR = 0.22; p > 0.05) and loyalty (β = 0.05; CR = 1.21; p > 0.05), but care quality and patient satisfaction fully mediate the association between NPAC and patient loyalty. It is concluded that NPAC in healthcare can improve care quality and indirectly increase patient satisfaction and loyalty through care quality. The incorporation of PA counselling into clinical nursing may, therefore, be consistent with the core mission of hospitals."

This study aimed to investigate the disaster law in the process of mining slope excavation, and further explore the optimal selection of excavation angle. Based on the systematic analysis of the residual sliding force and deformation response characteristics during slope excavation, the increment of the residual sliding force increases and the stability coefficient decreases with the increase in excavation depth. Additionally, a numerical model of the Jinchuan mining area in Jinchuan City, Gansu Province, China was created using the Midas-GTS finite element software. The influence of different excavation slope angles on slope stability was analyzed via numerical simulation under certain step slope height and width. The results show that the force and deformation of the slope were unfavorable to slope stability, and the slope stability coefficient would decrease gradually with the increase in slope angle. In addition, the optimal excavation angle combination ranges were determined as 62°~ 65°, 64°~ 67°, 67°~ 69°, 70°~ 71°, 73°, 75°~ 76°, 77°~ 80°considering the stability and maximum recovery. Therefore, the above research results verify the loading effect of mine slope excavation, and can serve as a reference for studies on the optimal range of excavation angles for the mine slope."

This study aimed to identify ultrasonographic (US) and cytopathologic features that are characteristic of follicular adenoma and carcinoma to aid in their differential diagnosis.A total of 98 surgically resected nodules diagnosed as follicular neoplasms between 2011 and 2012 were analyzed. US findings were reviewed according to the Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (K-TIRADS). Six cytologic features (high cellularity, abundant microfollicles, cell crowding/nuclear overlapping, isolated cells, homogeneous nuclei, abundant colloid) were reviewed quantitatively. The radiologic findings and quantification of cytologic features were correlated with final diagnoses.In total, 70 (71.4%) and 28 (28.6%) of the nodules were follicular adenomas and follicular carcinomas, respectively. US findings of a heterogeneous echogenicity, speculated/ill-defined margin, and presence of calcifications were significantly associated with follicular carcinoma (p<0.05). Calcifications had a predilection for pericapsular areas than for stromal areas in follicular carcinomas, whereas their location was more varied in follicular adenomas. No cytologic feature was significantly different between follicular adenomas and carcinomas.Distinct from follicular adenomas, follicular carcinomas are characterized by heterogeneous echogenicity, speculated/ill-defined margin, and presence of calcifications on US. Thus, US findings can be helpful to differentiate between these two follicular neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W4286500627,"To gain understanding into the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of muscle genes, we sought to determine if genes targeted by the myogenic transcription factor Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) were enriched for specific core promoter elements. We identified 330 known MEF2 target promoters in Drosophila , and analyzed them for for the presence and location of 17 known consensus promoter sequences. As a control, we also searched all Drosophila RNA polymerase II-dependent promoters for the same sequences. We found that promoter motifs were readily detected in the MEF2 target dataset, and that many of them were slightly enriched in frequency compared to the control dataset. A prominent sequence over-represented in the MEF2 target genes was NDM2, that appeared in over 50% of MEF2 target genes and was 2.5-fold over-represented in MEF2 targets compared to background. To test the functional significance of NDM2, we identified two promoters containing a single copy of NDM2 plus an upstream MEF2 site, and tested the activity of these promoters in vivo. Both the sticks and stones and Kahuli fragments showed strong skeletal myoblast-specific expression of a lacZ reporter in embryos. However, the timing and level of reporter expression was unaffected when the NDM2 site in either element was mutated. These studies identify variations in promoter architecture for a set of regulated genes compared to all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes, and underline the potential redundancy in the activities of some core promoter elements."
