https://openalex.org/W1976692354,"To characterize cell surface molecules involved in control of growth of malignant lymphocytes, monoclonal antibodies were raised against the human B lymphoblast cell line SKW6.4. One monoclonal antibody, anti-APO-1, reacted with a 52-kilodalton antigen (APO-1) on a set of activated human lymphocytes, on malignant human lymphocyte lines, and on some patient-derived leukemic cells. Nanogram quantities of anti-APO-1 completely blocked proliferation of cells bearing APO-1 in vitro in a manner characteristic of a process called programmed cell death or apoptosis. Cell death was preceded by changes in cell morphology and fragmentation of DNA. This process was distinct from antibody- and complement-dependent cell lysis and was mediated by the antibody alone. A single intravenous injection of anti-APO-1 into nu/nu mice carrying a xenotransplant of a human B cell tumor induced regression of this tumor within a few days. Histological thin sections of the regressing tumor showed that anti-APO-1 was able to induce apoptosis in vivo. Thus, induction of apoptosis as a consequence of a signal mediated through cell surface molecules like APO-1 may be a useful therapeutic approach in treatment of malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1996548067,"Interleukin-6 mediates pleiotropic functions in various types of cells through its specific receptor (IL-6-R), the cDNA of which has already been cloned. We report here that an 80 kd single polypeptide chain (IL-6-R) is involved in IL-6 binding and that IL-6 triggers the association of this receptor with a non-ligand-binding membrane glycoprotein, gp130. The association takes place at 37 degrees C within 5 min and is stable for at least 40 min in the presence of IL-6, but does not occur at 0 degree C. Human IL-6-R can associate with a murine gp130 homolog and is functional in murine cells. Mutant IL-6-R lacking the intracytoplasmic portion is functional, suggesting that the two polypeptide chains interact to involve their extracellular portion. In fact, a soluble IL-6-R lacking the transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains can associate with gp130 in the presence of IL-6 and mediate its function. These findings indicate that the complex of IL-6 and IL-6-R can interact with a non-ligand-binding membrane glycoprotein, gp130, extracellularly and can provide the IL-6 signal."
https://openalex.org/W2072490043,"When rodents are infected with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, large numbers of eosinophils appear in their blood and lungs and their serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) is increased. Injection of a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5 completely suppressed the blood eosinophilia and the infiltration of eosinophils in the lungs of parasitized mice but had no effect on serum IgE. In contrast, an antibody to interleukin-4 inhibited parasite-induced IgE but not the eosinophilia. These results show that interleukin-5 is important in eosinophil production in vivo and that IgE and eosinophil production are regulated by different cytokines produced by the TH2 subset of CD4-expressing T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2022721580,Heat shock proteins are evolutionarily highly conserved polypeptides that are produced under a variety of stress conditions to preserve cellular functions. A major antigen of tubercle bacilli of 65 kilodaltons is a heat shock protein that has significant sequence similarity and cross-reactivity with antigens of various other microbes. Monoclonal antibodies against this common bacterial heat shock protein were used to identify a molecule of similar size in murine macrophages. Macrophages subjected to various stress stimuli including interferon-γ activation and viral infection were recognized by class I-restricted CD8 T cells raised against the bacterial heat shock protein. These data suggest that heat shock proteins are processed in stressed host cells and that epitopes shared by heat shock proteins of bacterial and host origin are presented in the context of class I molecules.
https://openalex.org/W2026668740,"Blue cone monochromacy is a rare X-linked disorder of color vision characterized by the absence of both red and green cone sensitivities. In 12 of 12 families carrying this trait, alterations are observed in the red and green visual pigment gene cluster. The alterations fall into two classes. One class arose from the wild type by a two-step pathway consisting of unequal homologous recombination and point mutation. The second class arose by nonhomologous deletion of genomic DNA adjacent to the red and green pigment gene cluster. These deletions define a 579-base pair region that is located 4 kilobases upstream of the red pigment gene and 43 kilobases upstream of the nearest green pigment gene; this 579-base pair region is essential for the activity of both pigment genes."
https://openalex.org/W1573118011,"C1q, a subunit of the first component (C1) of the classical complement pathway, and the pulmonary surfactant protein SP-A are structurally homologous molecules, each having an extended collagen-like domain contiguous with a non-collagenous domain. It is the collagen-like region of C1q that binds to mononuclear phagocytes and mediates the enhancement of phagocytosis of opsonized particles by these cells. Because SP-A enhances the endocytosis of phospholipids by alveolar type II cells and alveolar macrophages, we examined whether these two molecules were functionally interchangeable. The phagocytosis of sheep erythrocytes opsonized with IgG or with IgM and complement was enhanced by the adherence of monocytes or macrophages, respectively, to SP-A. The enhanced response was dependent on the concentration of SP-A used for coating the surfaces, similar to that seen when monocytes were adhered to C1q-coated surfaces. Both the percentage of cells ingesting the opsonized targets and the number of targets ingested per cell increased with increasing concentrations of SP-A. No such enhancement was seen with cells adhered to albumin, iron-saturated transferrin, or uncoated surfaces. However, SP-A did not substitute for C1q in the formation of hemolytically active C1. C1q did not stimulate lipid uptake by alveolar type II cells or alveolar macrophages and had only a slight inhibitory effect on the binding of SP-A to alveolar type II cells. Thus, these results suggested that a function which requires interactions of both the collagenous and the non-collagenous regions (i.e. initiation of the classic complement cascade) could not be mimicked by a protein sharing structural macromolecular similarity but lacking sequence homology in the non-collagen-like region. However, SP-A could substitute for C1q in stimulating a function previously shown to be mediated by the collagen-like domains of the C1q molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1483755415,"Synthetic compounds called tyrphostins were examined for their effects on cells which are mitogenically responsive to epidermal growth factor (EGF). We studied in detail the effects of two tyrphostins on EGF binding, tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells, EGF-receptor internalization, and mitogenesis. These compounds inhibited EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in a specific manner and the degree of selectivity varied. Both compounds inhibited EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous substrates in intact cells at doses that correlated with the IC50 for [3H] thymidine incorporation. These results are consistent with the notion that tyrosine phosphorylation is a crucial signal in transduction of the mitogenic message delivered by EGF. The compound RG50864 demonstrated specificity at inhibiting EGF-stimulated cell growth compared with stimulation with either platelet-derived growth factor or serum. For both compounds RG50864 and RG50810, long term exposure (16 h) of cells to tyrphostins was required for optimal inhibition because of the instability and slow action of these compounds. Tyrphostins did not alter cell surface display of EGF-receptor, EGF binding or EGF-induced internalization, degradation, and down-regulation of EGF receptors. These novel synthetic inhibitors, specific for EGF-receptor kinase, offer a new method to inhibit EGF-stimulated cell proliferation which may be useful in treating specific pathological conditions involving cellular proliferation, including different types of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2039243922,"The pathogenesis of Heymann nephritis, a rat model of human membranous glomerulonephritis, depends on the interaction of autoantibodies with a renal glycoprotein (GP330) on glomerular podocytes. Partial complementary DNAs coding for GP330 were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence from 4.3 kilobases of complementary DNA contains the sequences identical to two peptides derived from the isolated glycoprotein. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein contains regions with homology to the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, an indication that GP330 and the LDL receptor may be members of the same gene family. Autoantibodies from the kidneys of rats with Heymann nephritis reacted with a nonglycosylated segment of GP330 that contains cysteine-rich 40-amino acid repeats, which are also features of the LDL receptor. GP330 is also similar in some regions to the mouse epidermal growth factor precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1561731791,"Abstract Activation of murine T cells by antigen, antibodies binding the T cell antigen receptor, or stimulatory anti-Thy-1 antibodies results in rapid phosphorylation of the T cell receptor zeta chain on tyrosine residues. The T cell receptor is itself unlikely to be a tyrosine kinase; rather, it is probable that this receptor is coupled to a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. To understand further this protein kinase pathway, additional targets of the tyrosine kinase have been sought by comparing anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoblots of cellular proteins from unactivated and activated T cell hybridomas. In addition to the T cell receptor zeta chain, two proteins of 53 and 62 kDa are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after T cell activation. These phosphorylations require stimulatory anti-Thy-1 antibodies, antigen, or antireceptor antibody stimulation. The 53-kDa protein is preferentially phosphorylated by antigen or antireceptor antibody. Of interest is that variants of the murine T cell hybridoma lacking the T cell receptor zeta chain or lacking surface antigen receptor can nonetheless be stimulated by anti-Thy-1 antibodies to phosphorylate the 62-kDa substrate. In contrast to the tyrosine kinases of oncogenic viruses, the kinase coupled to the T cell antigen receptor appears to have a limited number of targets. These proteins are candidates for critical substrates in this protein tyrosine kinase pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1600993549,"2,5-Di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (tBuBHQ), a potent inhibitor of liver microsomal ATP-dependent Ca2+ sequestration (Moore, G. A., McConkey, D. J., Kass, G. E. N., O'Brien, P. J., and Orrenius, S. (1987) FEBS Lett. 224, 331-336), produced a concentration-dependent, rapid increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in isolated rat hepatocytes (EC50 = 1-2 microM). The amplitude of the [Ca2+]i increase was essentially identical with that produced by vasopressin, but the tBuBHQ-stimulated [Ca2+]i increase remained sustained for 15-20 min. Vasopressin added 2-3 min after tBuBHQ caused [Ca2+]i to rapidly return to basal levels; however, tBuBHQ added after vasopressin resulted in a Ca2+ transient rather than a sustained [Ca2+]i elevation. Ca2+ influx was not stimulated in tBuBHQ-treated hepatocytes, but was markedly enhanced upon addition of vasopressin. Depletion of the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ pool by the addition of vasopressin to hepatocytes incubated in low Ca2+ medium virtually abolished the tBuBHQ-mediated [Ca2+]i rise and vice versa. In saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes, tBuBHQ released Ca2+ from the same nonmitochondrial, ATP-dependent Ca2+ pool which was released by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Furthermore, tBuBHQ-induced Ca2+ release in saponin-permeabilized cells was not inhibited by neomycin, and tBuBHQ did not produce any apparent accumulation of inositol phosphates in intact hepatocytes. The rate of passive efflux of Ca2+ from Ca2+-loaded hepatic microsomes was unaltered by tBuBHQ. Thus, tBuBHQ inhibits ATP-dependent Ca2+ sequestration via a direct effect on the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, resulting in net Ca2+ release and elevation of [Ca2+]i. Taken together, our results show that in the absence of hormonal stimuli, excess Ca2+ is only slowly cleared from the hepatocyte cytosol, indicating that the basal rate of Ca2+ removal by the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump and mitochondria is slow. Furthermore, Ca2+-mobilizing hormones appear to stimulate an active process of Ca2+ removal from hepatocyte cytosol which does not depend on re-uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1884801295,"Recent in vivo studies have shown that treatments that decrease circulating prolactin (PRL) in rodents result in significant immunosuppression. Our attempts to demonstrate corresponding direct stimulatory effects of PRL on cultured lymphocytes were unsuccessful. However, antibodies against pituitary PRL potently inhibited both murine and human lymphocyte proliferation in response to both T and B cell mitogens. Further studies using IL 2 and IL 4 responsive cell lines (CTLL-2 and HT-2) demonstrated that the same anti-PRL antibodies inhibited the proliferative response to these cytokine growth factors. Thus, antibodies to PRL appear to block an event occurring in the G1 to GS phase transition of these cell lines, which constitutively express growth factor receptors. The inhibitory activity of anti-PRL antibodies could be adsorbed by addition of purified human PRL or by immobilized PRL on an affinity column. Antibodies to other pituitary hormones were without inhibitory effect on CTLL-2 cell proliferation. Proliferation of lymphocytes in serum-free medium was also potently inhibited by anti-PRL antibodies, suggesting that antibody effects were not due to neutralization of PRL or other factors contained in culture serum supplements. We suggest from these data that a protein with homology to PRL and recognized by these anti-PRL antibodies is produced by lymphocytes and plays a critical role in their progression through the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1488573278,"Rat peritoneal exudate cells produce two interleukin 6 (IL6) messenger RNA species, a major 1200 nucleotide and a 5-fold less abundant, 2400-nucleotide species. A cDNA clone representing the major species was isolated, and sequenced. The 1055-base pair insert covered the 3'-nontranslated region, the 211 triplet coding region and most of the 5'-nontranslated region. The derived rat IL6 amino acid sequence was 93 and 58% identical, respectively, with mature murine and human IL6. Rat IL6 lacks N-glycosylation sites but contains a fifth cysteinyl residue in addition to the 4 residues shared in conserved positions with murine and human IL6. Stable murine L cell and human HeLa-derived cell lines were established by cotransfection with rat IL6 cDNA and a selectable neomycin resistance marker. These lines secrete 9-fold increased amounts of functional IL6 over their respective parental cells. A stable rat macrophage-derived cell line, RM-SV1, was established by transformation with simian virus 40. IL6 and Il1 mRNA levels are inducible 20- and 3.5-fold, respectively, in this line by treatment with lipopolysaccharide with kinetics characteristic of macrophages. A set of three overlapping genomic DNA clones was isolated and a 10-kilobase DNA segment was sequenced containing the rat IL6 gene plus 2.9 kilobases of 5'-flanking and 1.3 kilobases of 3'-flanking sequences. The two transcription start sites used in RM-SV1 cells were mapped within 5 base pairs of each other. The exon/intron boundaries are conserved with the murine and human IL6 genes. The two IL6 mRNA species are generated by alternative polyadenylation at sites separated by a distance of 1.2 kilobases. The intervening region contains a repetitive element 72-80% identical with the rat and murine consensus L1 family sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2081670113,"Protein interiors contain many tightly packed apolar atoms in a nearly crystalline state. Both shielding of apolar atoms from solvent and efficient interior packing arrangements affect protein stability, but their relative importance is unclear. To separate these effects, the stabilities of wild-type and mutant gene V proteins from bacteriophage fl were studied by measuring resistance to denaturation. The effects of subtle interior packing changes, both separate from and combined with changes in buried side chain hydrophobicity, were measured. For the interior apolar-to-apolar substitutions studied, the two effects were of the same magnitude and alteration of packing without accompanying hydrophobicity changes substantially destabilized the protein."

https://openalex.org/W2082624955,"In B6AF1 mice, T lymphocytes that use the V beta 11-positive (and not V beta 6-positive or V beta 8-positive) segment in their receptor for antigen are greatly reduced in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues, most likely as a result of clonal deletion. The relative number of V beta 11-positive cells in adult lymph nodes was ten times as high in B6AF1 mice thymectomized 1 to 4 days after birth as in normal mice. Moreover, for the first 10 days of life of B6AF1 mice, mature V beta 11-positive T cells were readily detected in the thymus and spleen. Thus neonatal thymectomy results in the maintenance of the receptor repertoire of early postnatal life, and this correlates with the subsequent development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1518250988,"Human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMC) rendered quiescent by maintenance under serum-free culture conditions for 48 h exhibited several metabolic responses, normally associated with proliferation, following exposure to low density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL induced a time- and dose- (half-maximally effective concentration, ED50 25.0 +/- 8 nM) dependent activation of S6 kinase which could be negated following pretreatment of hVSMC with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 48 h. In myo-[3H]inositol-prelabeled hVSMC, LDL caused a rapid (maximum within 1 min) decrease in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (35% p less than 0.001) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (20%, p less than 0.01) with a return to prestimulated levels within 5-10 min. LDL induced a concomitant increase in [3H]inositol phosphates for which the order of generation was inositol-tris greater than -bis greater than -mono phosphate and which reached threshold levels of significance (p less than 0.05) above control values within 1, 2, and 10 min, respectively. The effect of LDL on hVSMC phosphoinositide metabolism was dose-dependent (half-maximally effective concentration, ED50 32.1 +/- 5.0 nM). This concentration, like that for S6 kinase, approximates with the KD (5-21 nM) for high affinity binding of 125I-LDL to specific receptors (1.5 x 10(4) sites/cell) on hVSMC. LDL induced a rapid but transient translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to membranes as assessed using both immunoblotting and [3H] 4-beta-phorbol-12-13-dibutyrate-binding procedures. Exposure of quiescent hVSMC to LDL elevated intracellular pH (delta pH 0.30 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.001). Such alkalinization was prevented in the presence of Na+/K+ exchange inhibitors such as amiloride, dimethylamiloride, and ethylisopropylamiloride. In an investigation of the nuclear action of LDL, a time-dependent induction of both c-myc and c-fos was observed. Such LDL-induced expression of these nuclear proto-onco-genes was not detectable in protein kinase C down-regulated hVSMC. Nevertheless, in spite of the cascade of growth-promotional responses elicited by LDL in quiescent hVSMC, this lipoprotein alone (under serum-free conditions) was neither mitogenic in nuclear labeling experiments, nor could it support growth of hVSMC in culture. We demonstrate that LDL might function in a complementary/synergistic fashion with other weakly mitogenic (to VSMC) growth factors and suggest that activation of protein kinase C (vis a vis intrinsic tyrosine kinase characteristic of other growth factor receptors) may be crucial to the signal transduction pathway for LDL."

https://openalex.org/W1580544733,"In this study, we examined whether and how the cellular activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2) is affected by glutathione (GSH), an important tripeptide existing in most cells. Cell culture and thymidine incorporation assay showed that addition of GSH enhanced the effect of IL-2 on the proliferation and thymidine incorporation of IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cells such as CTLL-2 and CT-4R. Treatment of the cells with GSH resulted in a 2-fold increase in the amount of IL-2 bound to the cells and a rapid internalization of the bound IL-2. In addition, the degradation of IL-2 in the cells was enhanced by GSH treatment. These effects of GSH were accompanied by an increase in the intracellular GSH level. L-Buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of de novo GSH synthesis, blunted the increase of intracellular GSH level and modulated the effect of GSH on IL-2 activity. These results suggest that GSH regulates the binding, internalization, degradation, and T-cell proliferative activity of IL-2; alterations of cellular GSH concentration may thus affect the growth and replication of IL-2-sensitive cytotoxic T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1540988218,"Abstract Large von Willebrand factor (vWf) multimers are assembled by the formation of disulfide bonds between dimers in trans Golgi and post-Golgi compartments. We were able to reproduce this process in a cell-free system using purified vWf dimers. The multimers formed in vitro extended to 5 x 10(6) Da and were similar in size distribution to those secreted constitutively by endothelial cells in culture. Multimerization occurred only at acidic pH with an optimum at pH 5.8 and needed the continued presence of an acidic pH for it to proceed. Pro-vWf dimers multimerized, whereas mature dimers failed to assemble into large multimers. Multimerization required the propolypeptide to be a contiguous part of pro-vWf subunits since free propolypeptide did not promote multimerization of mature dimers. In addition, multimers formed in the presence of both pro-vWf and mature vWf dimers incorporated only pro-vWf dimers. Two out of six available monoclonal antibodies to the prosequence inhibited multimerization. Multimerization was also inhibited by chemical blocking of free sulfhydryl(s). The free sulfhydryl(s) were localized to the mature region of the pro-vWf by examination of the mature subunit and the propolypeptide derived by proteolytic cleavage of pro-vWf subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1580635581,"The effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on membrane potential were investigated in suspensions of the following three cell types endowed with a large complement of specific receptors: EGFR-T17 (a clone of mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing EGF receptors); A431 and KB (two human carcinoma lines). In all these lines EGF induced a rapid and marked hyperpolarization constituted by an initial peak (in all three cell lines) and a subsequent sustained plateau phase, concomitant with the well-known increase of [Ca2+]i. The time course and phorbol ester inhibitability of the membrane potential effects were the same as for the [Ca2+]i response. Experiments with Na+-free and chloride-free media excluded a major role of the latter ions in the EGF-induced hyperpolarization. In contrast, experiments with high K+ media, with the monovalent cation ionophore gramicidin and with Ca2+-free media together with either a Ca2+ ionophore (ionomycin, in A431 and EGFR-T17), or an agonist (bradykinin, in A431) addressed to a receptor coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, were consistent with the involvement of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. The EGF-induced hyperpolarization was completely blocked by the K+ channel blocker, quinidine, and unaffected by a variety of other drugs. Patch clamping of individual EGFR-T17 cells confirmed the initial hyperpolarization (from approximately -30 mV, the resting potential, to -60, -80 mV) was due to activation of an outward current. This initial hyperpolarization was followed by fluctuations (period approximately 1 min) persisting as long as the cells could be analyzed. Thus, the changes of membrane potential appear to be not only novel members of the group of early events triggered by EGF in target cells but also long-lasting effects of the growth factor, which continue for unexpectedly long periods of time after EGF application."

https://openalex.org/W1513013277,"Abstract The proliferation of activated T lymphocytes is dependent on the interaction of the polypeptide growth factor interleukin 2 (IL 2) with its heterodimeric receptor, which consists of a p55 alpha subunit and a p70-75 beta subunit. Previously, it was shown that IL 2 stimulates rapid serine phosphorylation of several membrane and cytysolic proteins. Here, using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to purify phosphotyrosyl proteins and two-dimensional gel analysis, we show that IL 2 stimulates rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of cellular proteins, including pp180, pp92, and pp42 in activated human T lymphocytes. In addition, we have examined IL 2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in the human cell line YT2C2 which expresses mostly the beta subunit of the IL 2 receptor and the gibbon cell line MLA-144 which expresses only the beta subunit. In both of these cell lines, IL 2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the same proteins phosphorylated in normal human T lymphocytes in response to IL 2. We conclude that the beta subunit is sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the normal cellular target substrates involved in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1515780008,"Abstract The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit complex which has a dual function of antigen recognition and signal transduction. One of its invariant subunits, the zeta chain, has been shown to have a significant role in the expression and function of the TCR on the cell surface. The mouse and human zeta cDNAs share significant homologies to each other but are distinct from all of the previously characterized TCR components. We now report the isolation and structural analysis of the complete murine zeta gene. This gene spans at least 31 kilobases and divides into eight exons. The first exon, which is located at least 20 kilobases upstream from the second exon, codes for the 5'-untranslated region and most of the signal peptide. The second exon codes for the remainder of the signal peptide, the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and the first three amino acids of the intracytoplasmic domain. Exons 3-7 encode the majority of the intracytoplasmic domain. The eight exon encodes the carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acids and the 3'-untranslated region. Four groups of mRNA initiation sites have been identified at approximately 140 base pairs upstream to the AUG codon. No TATA-like box has been detected. The gene is localized to the distal part of chromosome 1 in a linkage group highly conserved between man and mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1568689237,"Abstract The genes encoding all three T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins have been cloned into overexpression plasmids. Induction of cells harboring these plasmids results in the synthesis of each accessory protein at levels that approach 10% of the total cellular protein. The solubility of the accessory proteins after induction at 42 degrees C ranges from about 60% to greater than 95%. A plasmid that allows overexpression of the 44P/62P complex has been manipulated further to overexpress selectively the 44P subunit without 62P, permitting us to assess how each subunit contributes to the properties of the 44P/62P complex. A comparison of 44P and 44P/62P by conventional hydrodynamic techniques shows that 44P forms a subcomplex nearly as large as the 44P/62P complex. In addition, 44P catalyzes DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis with a specific activity similar to that of the 44P/62P ATPase. However, unlike the 44P/62P complex, the ATPase activity of 44P alone is only slightly stimulated by 45P. This suggests that one role of the 62P subunit is to facilitate a productive interaction of 44P and 45P."
https://openalex.org/W1562089313,"Abstract Brains of adult male rats were dissected into five distinct regions: brainstem, cerebellum, hippocampus, diencephalon, and telencephalon. Epidermal growth factor-like immunoreactivity was isolated and characterized by radioimmunoassay and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radioimmunoassay indicated levels of standard rat epidermal growth factor equivalents ranging from 0.99 to 0.33 ng/g wet weight of brain tissue. Competition curves were not parallel to those generated with standard rat epidermal growth factor, indicating a lack of structural identity between the immunoreactive material in the brain and standard rat epidermal growth factor. Extracts of submandibular gland and blood did, however, produce parallel competition curves. Electrophoresis indicated the presence of multiple bands of immunoreactive material in each of the regions of the brain. The major bands of activity migrated to positions distinct from that of standard rat epidermal growth factor. This is the first demonstration of multiple forms of epidermal growth factor-like immunoreactive material in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1504944877,"T3M4 human pancreatic carcinoma cells avidly bound and internalized 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) but did not readily degrade the ligand. Pulse-chase experiments in which the cell-bound radioactivity was allowed to dissociate into the incubation medium in the presence of unlabeled EGF indicated that the majority of the released 125I-EGF consisted of intact EGF and a slightly processed species that readily bound to the cell. Omission of unlabeled EGF during the chase period markedly decreased the amount of radioactivity in the incubation medium, mainly as a result of the rebinding of EGF to the cells. In contrast, T3M4 cells readily degraded 125I-labeled transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and the released radiolabeled products did not rebind to the cells. Both ligands were released from T3M4 cells under acidic conditions, complete dissociation occurring at a pH of 4.5 for EGF, and a pH of 6.5 for TGF-alpha. A 431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells and ASPC-1 human pancreatic carcinoma cells also failed to extensively degrade 125I-EGF, whereas Rat-1 fibroblasts markedly degraded the growth factor. As in the case of T3M4 cells, ASPC-1 cells extensively degraded 125I-TGF-alpha. Degradation of either ligand was blocked by the lysosomotropic compound methylamine in all the tested cell lines. Immunoprecipitation of the EGF receptor with specific polyclonal antibodies and Western blot analysis revealed the anticipated 170-kDa protein in T3M4 cells. Both EGF and TGF-alpha enhanced EGF receptor degradation, but TGF-alpha was less effective than EGF. These findings indicate that in certain cell types EGF and TGF-alpha may be differentially processed."
https://openalex.org/W1633360739,"Abstract The interaction between type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor, and the three serine proteases generated during contact activation of plasma was studied using functional and immunologic approaches. Incubation of Factor XIIa, Factor XIa, and plasma kallikrein with either purified PAI-1 or platelet-derived PAI-1 resulted in the formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes as revealed by immunoblotting techniques. Functional assays indicated that Factor XIa and, to a lesser extent, Factor XIIa and plasma kallikrein neutralized the ability of purified PAI-1 to bind to immobilized tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Immunoblotting demonstrated that these enzymes also neutralized the ability of PAI-1 to form complexes with fluid-phase t-PA. Clot lysis assays employing purified proteins and 125I-fibrinogen were used to investigate the profibrinolytic effect of these contact activation enzymes. At enzyme concentrations that did not result in direct activation of plasminogen, only Factor XIa was capable of stimulating the lysis of clots supplemented with both t-PA and PAI-1. As a consequence of their interactions with PAI-1, the amidolytic activity of Factor XIIa, Factor XIa, and plasma kallikrein was neutralized by this inhibitor in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. Minimum values estimated for the apparent second-order rate constant of inhibition were 1.6 x 10(4), 2.1 x 10(5), and 6.0 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for Factor XIIa, Factor XIa, and plasma kallikrein, respectively. These data define new reactions between coagulation and fibrinolysis proteins and suggest that a major mechanism for stimulation of the intrinsic fibrinolytic pathway may involve neutralization of PAI-1 by Factor XIa."
https://openalex.org/W1520615415,"Monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-L25 identifies an antigen on the surface of human lymphocytes. This mAb immunoprecipitated three distinct polypeptides of Mr 150,000, 85,000, and 75,000 from Nonidet P-40 lysates of surface radioiodinated lymphocytes. The three polypeptides were found under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. An additional polypeptide of Mr 130,000 was detected in mAb anti-L25 immuno-precipitates when cells were lysed with CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate). Epitope localization experiments indicated that both the Mr 150,000 and 85,000 polypeptides contained antibody reactive sites. Peptide mapping studies demonstrated structural similarities in the Mr 150,000 and 85,000 components. The analysis of L25 subunits from lysates of antigen-stimulated T lymphocytes revealed a loss of the Mr 150,000 polypeptides in mAb anti-L25 immunoprecipitates. Solid phase double determinant binding assays demonstrated that L25 is similar and probably identical to lymphocyte surface antigen very late activation-4. This relationship placed L25 as a member of the integrin receptor superfamily."

https://openalex.org/W1600858914,"Kinetic deuterium isotope effects for the noncompetitive, intermolecular monoamine oxidase B-catalyzed oxidation of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to the corresponding 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium species MPDP+ were found to be 3.55 on Vmax and 8.01 on Vmax/Km with MPTP-6,6-d2 as the deuterated substrate. Similar values were obtained with MPTP-2,2,6-d4 and MPTP-CD3-2,2,6,6-d4. The deuterium isotope effect for the electrochemical oxidation of 1 mM MPTP-2,2,6,6-d4 was only 1.35. These results indicate that the monoamine oxidase B-catalyzed oxidation of this substrate may not proceed via a reaction pathway involving alpha-carbon deprotonation of an aminium radical intermediate. Isotope effect measurements also established that the rate of inactivation of monoamine oxidase B by MPTP is unaffected by replacement of the C-6 methylene protons with deuterons, but is retarded by replacement of the C-2 methylene protons (DKi = 1.9). The mechanism-based inactivation of monoamine oxidase B by MPTP, therefore, is likely to mediated by a species derived from the enzyme-generated 2,3-dihydropyridinium oxidation product."
https://openalex.org/W1668831292,"Abstract Human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) and a soluble recombinant form of the human p55 (Tac antigen) component of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) have been cocrystallized in 1.7-1.8 M ammonium sulfate, in the pH range 7.0-8.2. Variously glycosylated forms of both receptor and ligand can be cocrystallized under those conditions. The best crystals of the putative receptor-ligand complex involve the enzymatically desialylated receptor and unglycosylated IL-2. These crystals belong to the trigonal space group P3(1)2(1) or its enantiomorph, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 91 A and c = 119 A, and diffract to 3.5 A resolution. There is one receptor-ligand complex asymmetric unit, with a Matthews coefficient of 2.7, assuming the presence of one IL-2 molecule-receptor molecule. Interestingly, in addition to IL-2 (Mr = 14,000), the p55 IL-2 receptor (Mr = 44,000) and two fragments of the receptor, of apparent Mr = 35,000 and 25,000, respectively, in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the crystals are enriched in a reducible dimeric form of the desialylated receptor (apparent Mr = 90,000), as compared with protein solution from which the crystals grow. The overall amino acid content in the crystals is consistent with a 1:1 ratio of receptor to ligand. A native data set has been collected on a multiwire area detector and the search for suitable heavy atom derivatives is in progress."

https://openalex.org/W1494450441,"The strip-of-helix hydrophobicity algorithm was devised to identify protein sequences which, when coiled as alpha or 3(10) helices, had one axial, hydrophobic strip and otherwise variably hydrophilic residues. The strip-of-helix hydrophobicity algorithm also ranked such sequences according to an index, the mean hydrophobicity of amino acids in the axial strip. This algorithm well predicted T cell-presented fragments of antigenic proteins. A derivative of this algorithm (the structural helices algorithm (SHA] was tested for the prediction of helices in crystallographically defined proteins. For the SHA, eight amino acid sequences, 2 cycles plus one amino acid in an alpha helix, with strip-of-helix hydrophobicity indices greater than 2.5, were selected with overlapping segments joined. These selections were terminated according to simple capping rules, which took into account the roles of N-terminal Asn or Pro and C-terminal Gly in the stability of helices. In analyses of 35 crystallographically defined proteins with known alpha and 3(10) helices, the predictions with the SHA overlapped (had overlap indices x greater than or equal to 0.5) with 34% of known helices, touched (had overlap indices 0.5 greater than x greater than 0) or overlapped with 66% of known helices, or were neighboring (came within 6 residues) or touched or overlapped with 82% of known helices. At each level of judging the quality of prediction, the SHA was usually less sensitive (correct predictions/total number of known helices) and more efficient (correct predictions/total number of predictions) than the Chou-Fasman and Garnier-Robson methods. It was simpler in design and calculation. The chemical mechanisms underlying these algorithms appear to apply both to protein folding and to selection of T cell-presented antigenic sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1583012584,"α1-Antitrypsin (AAT) is a major hepatic secretory protein. The elevated synthesis of human AAT within hepatocytes of transgenic mice results in its accumulation within a subset of distended cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The protein does not accumulate in large insoluble aggregates as is the case for the human PiZ AAT variant. Furthermore, the accumulated protein is not associated with immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein. Transgenic animals exhibiting an elevated synthesis and subsequent intrahepatic accumulation of human AAT exhibit reduced serum levels of murine AAT as a result of its hindered secretion and accumulation within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, the secretion of murine transferrin and albumin which represent glycosylated and non-glycosylated hepatic secretory proteins, respectively, is unaffected. Overall, these results demonstrate that the elevated synthesis of human AAT can hinder the export of murine AAT from the hepatic rough endoplasmic reticulum in an apparently specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1555293036,"Neutral amino acid uptake into mammalian cells occurs predominantly through the L, A, and ASC carrier-mediated transport systems. The proteins responsible for transport by these systems have not been isolated, and the three pathways presently are defined by their amino acid specificity and physiologic parameters. We have found that the amino acid derivative, O-diazoacetyl-L-serine (azaserine), is a potentially useful probe for identification of the L-(leucine-favoring) system transporter in human T-lymphocytes. Uptake of azaserine competitively inhibits the uptake of the prototype L-system amino acid, 2-amino-2-carboxybicycloheptane (BCH). Azaserine undergoes photolytic cleavage with 365 nm incident light to yield a highly reactive carbene intermediate and free N2. Following photolysis of [14C]azaserine in a suspension of lymphocytes, the 14C label is detectable within a crude cytoplasmic membrane preparation, and this process is inhibited by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled azaserine or 2-amino-2-carboxybicycloheptane, suggesting that the 14C-product is associated with the membranes at or near the L-system transport site. Furthermore, photolysis of azaserine in the presence of lymphocytes results in specific irreversible inhibition of L-system transport. Thus, photolysis of azaserine provides an initial step toward the identification of the L-system transporter."

https://openalex.org/W1513357943,"Abstract RNA polymerase was purified from Rhodobacter sphaeroides cells grown both chemoheterotrophically and photoheterotrophically. Both preparations of polymerase were comprised of five major subunits designated: beta' (160,000 Da), beta (150,000 Da), sigma (93,000 Da), alpha (41,000 Da), and a 35,000-Da protein, designated epsilon. All five subunits of the polymerase isolated from photoheterotrophically grown cells were found to be serologically related to the major subunits (beta', beta, sigma, and alpha) of the RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli; however, only four of the subunits of the RNA polymerase isolated from chemoheterotrophically grown cells were serologically related to the four major E. coli RNA polymerase subunits. The enzyme isolated from photoheterotrophically grown cells had a lower specific activity and was considerably less stable than the enzyme isolated from chemoheterotrophically grown cells. However, RNA synthesis by both enzyme preparations was dependent upon the presence of DNA template and MgCl2, and the RNA synthetic activity was inhibited by rifampicin. The transcriptional activities of both samples of polymerase were studied using different DNA templates, and the sizes of the run-off products compared to expected values obtained from analysis of mRNA's produced in vivo. These results are discussed in light of DNA sequences expected to contain promoter-like regions as determined from in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W1677079760,"Abstract A genetically engineered lac repressor/T7 endonuclease hybrid protein shows repressor-like binding toward restriction fragments carrying the lac operator. In addition, fragments carrying the operator near a particular pBR322 sequence are cleaved into specific products. Cleavage occurs at precise positions within that sequence, is independent of the orientation of the operator, is inhibited by isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, and is observed when the target is separated from the operator by at least as few as 150 and as many as 240 base pairs. This evidence indicates that the hybrid protein is a site-directed nuclease that requires the following two structural elements for activity: the lac operator and a target. Repressor-like binding directs the enzyme to the operator and nearby single-stranded DNA targets. The discovery of an unusual target in a well-studied DNA sequence is evidence of the power of this approach for probing unusual structures in non-supercoiled duplex DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1500178035,"Abstract Upon exposure to holoricin-antibody conjugates, target cells display a period of no measurable intoxication followed by a concentration-dependent exponential decline in protein synthesis. The rate of this decline is increased by conjugate structural variables such as addition of a second ricin to the antibody or introduction of a peptide spacer between the toxin and antibody. Additionally, the rate is enhanced by the addition of ammonia or monensin. The relationship between immunotoxin concentration and the rate of protein synthesis inhibition is shown to obey typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. By displacing bound immunotoxin with native antibody, it was demonstrated that the rate-limiting saturable process is not due to antibody-surface antigen interaction. Although addition of a second ricin as well as addition of ammonia elevated the measured rate of protein synthesis inhibition, curve-fitting techniques indicated that they did not elevate the maximal rate; however, introduction of a peptide spacer into the conjugate or addition of monensin increased the maximal rate of this saturable process. Additionally, the kinetic examination of the potentiation effects of ammonia and monensin indicates that they operate on different cellular processes involved with the intracellular routing toward intoxication. An equational model is developed which helps interpret the known features of the conjugate intoxication process."
https://openalex.org/W1573217821,Human subjects and mice have been found to have a milder progression of muscular dystrophy when the disease is associated with genotypically determined dwarfism. In this paper we describe an experimental test for reducing growth hormone in dystrophic chickens that uses rabbit anti-chicken growth hormone anti-serum (anti-cGH). Antiserum was injected daily into dystrophic (line 413) male chickens from day 1 to day 8 after hatching. Dystrophic chickens injected with anti-cGH maintained a significantly higher score in the standardized test for righting ability (P less than 0.001-0.051) from 3 to 9 1/2 wk after hatching when compared with dystrophic controls. The observed prolongation of the functional ability of injected dystrophic animals suggests that growth hormone plays a role in potentiating the symptoms of dystrophy in chickens.
