https://openalex.org/W2035309519,"Two-thirds of 258 fruit species from Peruvian tropical forest belong to one of two classes: large orange, yellow, brown, or green fruits with a husk; or small red, black, white, blue, purple, or mixed-color fruits without a husk. The characteristics of the two fruit classes match the size, visual ability, and jaw morphology of mammals and birds, respectively, and the animals also prefer to eat one class of fruits. Thus, most plants in this forest seem to be adapted to seed dispersal by either of two distinct broad arrays of animal taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2089510977,"Modern pollen surface samples from six lake and marsh sites in the northern California Coast Ranges establish a linear relation between elevation and the oakl(oak + pine) pollen ratio. Modern temperature and precipitation lapse rates were used to convert variations in the pollen ratio into temperature and precipitation changes. Pollen data from two cores from Clear Lake, Lake County, California, spanning the past 40,000 and 130,000 years were used to estimate temperature and precipitation changes through the last full glacial cycle. The maximum glacial cooling is estimated to be 7 degrees to 8 degrees C; the last full interglacial period was about 1.5 degrees C warmer than the Holocene, and a mid-Holocene interval was warmer than the present. The estimated precipitation changes are probably less reliable than the estimated temperature changes."
https://openalex.org/W2082189637,"The conspicuous white silken adornments known as stabilimenta, which are commonly found in the orb webs of some spiders, appear to be protective devices that warn birds of the presence of webs in their flight path. Webs endowed with artificial equivalents of stabilimenta tended to survive intact the early morning period when birds are on the wing; unmarked webs showed a high incidence of destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2004002941,"The energetic nuclei in cosmic rays interact with meteoroids, the moon, planets, and other solar system matter. The nuclides and heavy nuclei tracks produced by the cosmic-ray particles in these targets contain a wealth of information about the history of the objects and temporal and spatial variations in the particle fluxes. Most lunar samples and many meteorites have complex histories of cosmic-ray exposure from erosion, gardening, fragmentation, orbital changes, and other processes. There appear to be variations in the past fluxes of solar particles, and possibly also galactic cosmic rays, on time scales of 104 to 107 years."
https://openalex.org/W2087576441,Group-living Collembola of the genus Hypogastrura coordinate their moulting by communication. Animals of different ages and moulting rhythms synchronized the moulting rhythms when combined in a single culture. This synchronization is apparently not dependent on external stimuli but is coordinated by chemical communication among these insects.
https://openalex.org/W2047824336,"Platy intergrowths of crystalline todorokite are associated with biogenic debris in the cores of manganese nodules from a site in the Pacific Ocean. Analyses by electron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that this material is composed of tunnels of chains of linked MnO(6) octahedra. The chemical composition, morphology, and stability of the todorokite differ from those of nickel-and copper-rich manganese oxides in nodules that have been identified as todorokite or buserite in earlier investigations."

https://openalex.org/W2002599967,"Volcanic glasses collected on the rim of Shorty Crater in the Apollo 17 area were formed 3.63 x 10(9) years ago. The amounts of xenon-136 produced by neutron-induced fission of uranium-235 indicate that the glasses resided on the lunar surface for about 38 million years before they were deeply buried. The glass spherules were reexcavated by the impact that formed Shorty Crater 17 million years ago, and remained undisturbed until they were collected."
