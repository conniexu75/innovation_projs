https://openalex.org/W2070793750,"Stem cell fate is influenced by specialized microenvironments that remain poorly defined in mammals. To explore the possibility that haematopoietic stem cells derive regulatory information from bone, accounting for the localization of haematopoiesis in bone marrow, we assessed mice that were genetically altered to produce osteoblast-specific, activated PTH/PTHrP receptors (PPRs). Here we show that PPR-stimulated osteoblastic cells that are increased in number produce high levels of the Notch ligand jagged 1 and support an increase in the number of haematopoietic stem cells with evidence of Notch1 activation in vivo. Furthermore, ligand-dependent activation of PPR with parathyroid hormone (PTH) increased the number of osteoblasts in stromal cultures, and augmented ex vivo primitive haematopoietic cell growth that was abrogated by gamma-secretase inhibition of Notch activation. An increase in the number of stem cells was observed in wild-type animals after PTH injection, and survival after bone marrow transplantation was markedly improved. Therefore, osteoblastic cells are a regulatory component of the haematopoietic stem cell niche in vivo that influences stem cell function through Notch activation. Niche constituent cells or signalling pathways provide pharmacological targets with therapeutic potential for stem-cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1975025595,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a subset of bone marrow cells that are capable of self-renewal and of forming all types of blood cells (multi-potential). However, the HSC 'niche'--the in vivo regulatory microenvironment where HSCs reside--and the mechanisms involved in controlling the number of adult HSCs remain largely unknown. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal has an essential role in inducing haematopoietic tissue during embryogenesis. We investigated the roles of the BMP signalling pathway in regulating adult HSC development in vivo by analysing mutant mice with conditional inactivation of BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA). Here we show that an increase in the number of spindle-shaped N-cadherin+CD45- osteoblastic (SNO) cells correlates with an increase in the number of HSCs. The long-term HSCs are found attached to SNO cells. Two adherens junction molecules, N-cadherin and beta-catenin, are asymmetrically localized between the SNO cells and the long-term HSCs. We conclude that SNO cells lining the bone surface function as a key component of the niche to support HSCs, and that BMP signalling through BMPRIA controls the number of HSCs by regulating niche size."

https://openalex.org/W2029073164,"Stem cells persist throughout life by self-renewing in numerous tissues including the central and peripheral nervous systems. This raises the issue of whether there is a conserved mechanism to effect self-renewing divisions. Deficiency in the polycomb family transcriptional repressor Bmi-1 leads to progressive postnatal growth retardation and neurological defects. Here we show that Bmi-1 is required for the self-renewal of stem cells in the peripheral and central nervous systems but not for their survival or differentiation. The reduced self-renewal of Bmi-1-deficient neural stem cells leads to their postnatal depletion. In the absence of Bmi-1, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene p16Ink4a is upregulated in neural stem cells, reducing the rate of proliferation. p16Ink4a deficiency partially reverses the self-renewal defect in Bmi-1-/- neural stem cells. This conserved requirement for Bmi-1 to promote self-renewal and to repress p16Ink4a expression suggests that a common mechanism regulates the self-renewal and postnatal persistence of diverse types of stem cell. Restricted neural progenitors from the gut and forebrain proliferate normally in the absence of Bmi-1. Thus, Bmi-1 dependence distinguishes stem cell self-renewal from restricted progenitor proliferation in these tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2011414076,"Mg2+ is an essential ion involved in a multitude of physiological and biochemical processes and a major constituent of bone tissue. Mg2+ homeostasis in mammals depends on the equilibrium between intestinal Mg2+ absorption and renal Mg2+ excretion, but little is known about the molecular nature of the proteins involved in the transepithelial transport of Mg2+ in these organs. Recently, it was shown that patients with mutations in TRPM6, a member of the transient receptor potential family of cation channels, suffer from hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH) as a result of impaired renal and/or intestinal Mg2+ handling. Here, we show that TRPM6 is specifically localized along the apical membrane of the renal distal convoluted tubule and the brush-border membrane of the small intestine, epithelia particularly associated with active Mg2+ (re)absorption. In kidney, parvalbumin and calbindin-D28K, two divalent-binding proteins, are co-expressed with TRPM6 and might function as intracellular Mg2+ buffers in the distal convoluted tubule. Heterologous expression of wild-type TRPM6 but not TRPM6 mutants identified in HSH patients induces a Mg2+- and Ca2+-permeable cation channel tightly regulated by intracellular Mg2+ levels. The TRPM6-induced channel displays strong outward rectification, has a 5-fold higher affinity for Mg2+ than for Ca2+, and is blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by ruthenium red. Our data indicate that TRPM6 comprises all or part of the apical Mg2+ channel of Mg2+-absorbing epithelia.

Our data indicate that TRPM6 comprises all or part of the apical Mg2+ channel of Mg2+-absorbing epithelia. Mg2+ is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and the second most common cation in the intracellular fluid. Homeostasis of Mg2+ levels is tightly regulated and depends on the balance between intestinal absorption and renal excretion. The kidney provides the most sensitive control for the Mg2+ balance. About 80% of the total serum Mg2+ is ultrafiltered through the glomerular membrane and subsequently reabsorbed in consecutive segments of the nephron (1.Dai L.J. Ritchie G. Kerstan D. Kang H.S. Cole D.E. Quamme G.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 51-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The final urinary excretion of Mg2+ is mainly determined by the active reabsorption of Mg2+ in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), 1The abbreviations used are: DCT, distal convoluted tubule; DM-nitrophen, dimethoxynitrophenamine tetrasodium salt; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HSH, hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia; MagNuM, Mg2+-nucleotide-inhibited; MIC, Mg2+-inhibited cation; NCC, NaCl co-transporter; NMDG+, N-methyl-d-glucosamine; RR, ruthenium red; TRP, transient receptor potential. because virtually no reabsorption takes places beyond this segment (1.Dai L.J. Ritchie G. Kerstan D. Kang H.S. Cole D.E. Quamme G.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 51-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Recently, a positional candidate screening approach in consanguineous families with hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH) revealed a critical region identified on chromosome 9q21.13 (2.Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M. Niemann Nejsum L. Vitzthum H. Klingel K. Kratz M. Haddad E. Ristoff E. Dinour D. Syrrou M. Nielsen S. Sassen M. Waldegger S. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Nat.

Sheffield V.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Individuals suffering from HSH display neurologic symptoms including seizures and tetany during infancy. These symptoms can be suppressed by life-long dietary magnesium supplementation, but, untreated, the disease may be fatal or result in neurological damage. The patho-physiology of HSH is largely unknown, but physiological studies have shown that there are defects in both intestinal Mg2+ absorption and renal Mg2+ reabsorption. Subsequent analysis of the critical region pointed to a gene, TRPM6, which was mutated in patients with HSH (2.Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M. Niemann Nejsum L. Vitzthum H. Klingel K. Kratz M. Haddad E. Ristoff E. Dinour D. Syrrou M. Nielsen S. Sassen M. Waldegger S. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 3.Walder R.Y. Landau D. Meyer P. Shalev H. Tsolia M. Borochowitz Z. Boettger M.B. Beck G.E. Englehardt R.K. Carmi R. Sheffield V.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The TRPM6 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential channel (TRP) family (4.Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Based on the structural and sequence similarities between individual TRP proteins, three subgroups are distinguished, namely the canonical TRPC-, the vanilloid-like TRPV-, and the melastatin-like TRPM subfamilies. Most members of the TRPC- and TRPV-subfamilies have been characterized as Ca2+-permeable cation channels playing a role in Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling (4.Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). However, the functional characterization of TRPM proteins is much more incomplete. TRPM6 shows 50% sequence homology with TRPM7 (also known as TRP-PLIK), which forms a Ca2+ and Mg2+-permeable cation channel. Unlike other members of the TRP family, TRPM6 and TRPM7 contain long carboxyl-terminal domains with similarity to the α-kinases (5.Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The identification of TRPM6 as the gene mutated in HSH represents the first case in which a human disorder has been attributed to a channel kinase. The aim of the present study was to functionally characterize TRPM6 as the first molecularly identified protein involved in active Mg2+ (re)absorption. To this end, the (sub)localization of TRPM6 was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis of kidney and duodenum sections. Subsequently, human TRPM6 cDNA was cloned, transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells and characterized using patch-clamp analysis in combination with Magfura-2-based intracellular Mg2+ measurements. Taken together, this study indicates that TRPM6 is a Mg2+-permeable channel localized to the apical domain of the distal convoluted tubule and the brush-border membrane of the absorptive cells in duodenum, the main sites of transepithelial Mg2+ transport. The absence of the TRPM6-dependent Mg2+ influx pathway in patients with HSH provides a straightforward explanation for the severe hypomagnesemia. Immunohistochemistry—Antiserum against TRPM6 was obtained by immunization of guinea pigs with a peptide encoding the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of mouse TRPM6 (NH2-ERDKNRSSLEDHTRL-COOH) coupled to key hole limpet hemocyanin. Kidneys from C57Bl/6 mice were cut into pieces, placed in 1% (w/v) periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde fixative for 2 h, incubated overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 15% (w/v) sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Duodenum samples from C57Bl/6 mice were cut into pieces, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, kidney and duodenum samples were cut into 5–7-μm sections and used for different staining procedures as described previously (6.Hoenderop J.G. Hartog A. Stuiver M. Doucet A. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody against parvalbumin was purchased from Swant (Bellinzona, Switzerland), whereas the NaCl co-transporter (NCC) antibody was kindly donated by Dr. J. Loffing (Zurich, Switzerland) (7.Nijenhuis T. Hoenderop J.G. Loffing J. van der Kemp A.W. Van Os C. Bindels R.J. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All negative controls, including sections incubated with pre-immune serum and undergoing pre-absorption for 1 h with 10 μg/ml TRPM6-peptide or solely with conjugated secondary antibodies, were devoid of any staining. Photographs were taken with a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Electrophysiology, Intracellular Mg2+Measurements, and Mg2+Uncaging—HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% CO2. They were transiently transfected with human TRPM6 in the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector using previously described methods (8.Trouet D. Nilius B. Voets T. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and electrophysiological recordings were made between 16 and 36 h after transfection. Successfully transfected cells were identified by their green fluorescence when illuminated at 480 nm. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in the tight seal whole-cell configuration at room temperature (20–25 °C) using an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Electronics). Currents were digitized at 10 kHz and digitally filtered at 2.9 kHz. Unless noted otherwise, cells were held at 0 mV, and voltage ramps of 200 ms duration ranging from –150 to 100 mV were applied every 2 s. Current densities were obtained by normalizing the current amplitude to the cell membrane capacitance. The time course of current development was determined by measuring the current in at 80 and –80 mV. The standard pipette solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 HEPES mm, pH 7.2. Where indicated, NaCl was equimolarly substituted by NMDG-Cl. In some experiments, the EDTA was omitted, and 0.1 mm EGTA was added. The extracellular solutions contained 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with either 10 mm EDTA (divalent-free solutions) or the indicated concentrations of divalent cations. To measure the relative permeability of divalent cations, we used solutions containing 120 mm NMDG-Cl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 20 mm of the chloride salt of the respective divalent cations. The pipette solution used for the intracellular Mg2+ measurements (e.g. Fig. 3a) contained 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm Magfura-2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. To measure the intracellular Mg2+ concentration, the dye was excited with light alternated between 350 and 380 nm using a monochromator-based system (TILL Photonics, Planegg, Germany), and the fluorescence signal was measured using a photo-diode. The ratio R of the fluorescent signal at both wavelengths was converted into intracellular Mg2+ concentration using the Grynkiewicz equation (9.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In vivo calibration constants were obtained by measuring R in cells dialyzed with pipette solutions containing 0, 2, and 100 mm free Mg2+. The pipette solution used in the Mg2+ uncaging experiments contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DM-nitrophen, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Magfura-2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The estimated free Mg2+ concentration of this solution is 0.05 mm. Stepwise increases in intracellular Mg2+ were obtained by applying short flashes of UV light from a xenon arc flash lamp (Rapp OptoElectronics, Hamburg, Germany). We also performed experiments using a similar DM-nitrophen-containing pipette solution devoid of Mg2+. Under these conditions, UV flashes had no significant effect on the whole-cell currents in TRPM6-expressing cells, thereby excluding direct effects of UV light or photolysis products of DM-nitrophen. Data Analysis—Data analysis and display was done using Microcal Origin software, version 7.0 (OriginLab Corporation). Group data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical comparisons between means. The recent finding that the TRPM6 messenger is found in the kidney and small intestine (3.Walder R.Y. Landau D. Meyer P. Shalev H. Tsolia M. Borochowitz Z. Boettger M.B. Beck G.E. Englehardt R.K. Carmi R. Sheffield V.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 2.Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M. Niemann Nejsum L. Vitzthum H. Klingel K. Kratz M. Haddad E. Ristoff E. Dinour D. Syrrou M. Nielsen S. Sassen M. Waldegger S. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), prompted us to determine the (sub)cellular localization of the TRPM6 protein in these organs. Using antiserum raised against the last 15 amino acids of the mouse TRPM6 carboxyl-terminus (NH2-ERDKNRSSLEDHTRL-COOH), immunopositive staining was observed in the superficial cortex of the mouse kidney, whereas the outer and inner medulla were negative. Importantly, TRPM6 was predominantly localized to the apical membrane of the immunopositive tubules (Fig. 1a). Next, co-stainings were performed combining the antisera against TRPM6 and the thiazide-sensitive NCC, which is a specific marker for DCT, the main site of active transcellular Mg2+ reabsorption along the nephron (10.Obermuller N. Bernstein P. Velazquez H. Reilly R. Moser D. Ellison D.H. Bachmann S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F900-F910PubMed Google Scholar). A complete co-localization of TRPM6 and NCC was observed in mouse kidney, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The segmental distribution of TRPM6 was compared with that of parvalbumin and calbindin-D28K, two cytosolic proteins that can act as endogenous Ca2+ and Mg2+ buffers (11.Yang W. Lee H.W. Hellinga H. Yang J.J. Proteins. 2002; 47: 344-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TRPM6 co-localized with parvalbumin in the proximal part of DCT (DCT1; Fig. 1b) and with calbindin-D28K in the distal part of DCT (DCT2; Fig. 1c). Expression of calbindin-D28K extended to TRPM6-negative cells in the connecting tubule and the cortical collecting duct (Fig. 1c). These results demonstrate that TRPM6 expression is restricted to DCT, where it is localized along the apical membrane (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, Schlingmann et al. reported the presence of TRPM6 mRNA in the proximal tubule (2.Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M. Niemann Nejsum L. Vitzthum H. Klingel K. Kratz M. Haddad E. Ristoff E. Dinour D. Syrrou M. Nielsen S. Sassen M. Waldegger S. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In the present study we did not, however, detect TRPM6 protein expression in this segment. Because TRPM6 mRNA was detected in the previous study by PCR using microdissected tubules, it is possible that small impurities of the dissected segments have been sufficient to yield a weak PCR band. In small intestine, TRPM6 was abundantly present in brush-border membranes of duodenum (Fig. 1e). Absorptive epithelial cells in the villi stained intensively for TRPM6. No staining was observed when duodenum sections were incubated with pre-immune anti-serum (Fig. 1e, right). For electrophysiological analysis of TRPM6, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with a vector containing the coding sequence for human TRPM6 (GenBank™ accession number NM_017662). Transfected cells perfused with a NaCl-based extracellular solution containing 1 mm CaCl2 exhibited characteristic outwardly rectifying currents immediately upon establishment of the whole-cell configuration (Fig. 2, a and c). When dialyzed with a divalent-free internal solution containing 10 mm EDTA, the amplitude of these outwardly rectifying currents rapidly increased to reach a plateau level within 100–200 s (Fig. 2a). These outwardly rectifying currents showed little or no time dependence during voltage steps to different potentials (Fig. 2d). In agreement with previous reports (12.Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 13.Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), we also observed outwardly rectifying currents in non-transfected HEK-293 cells dialyzed with a Mg2+-free internal solution. However, when compared with TRPM6-expressing cells, these currents were undetectable immediately upon establishment of the whole-cell configuration, developed over a longer time period, and reached maximal amplitudes that were ∼10 times smaller (Fig. 2b). HEK-293 cells transfected with two of the TRPM6 mutants identified in HSH patients (TRPM6S590X and TRPM6Arg-736 fs X-737, in which fs stands for frameshift and X is a stopcodon) displayed currents with similar amplitude and activation kinetics as non-transfected cells (Fig. 2, a and b), indicating that these mutant proteins are non-functional. Note that all mutations found in HSH patients code for truncated proteins that lack all six transmembrane domains as well as the carboxyl-terminal α-kinase domain (2.Schlingmann K.P. Weber S. Peters M. Niemann Nejsum L. Vitzthum H. Klingel K. Kratz M. Haddad E. Ristoff E. Dinour D. Syrrou M. Nielsen S. Sassen M. Waldegger S. Seyberth H.W. Konrad M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 3.Walder R.Y. Landau D. Meyer P. Shalev H. Tsolia M. Borochowitz Z. Boettger M.B. Beck G.E. Englehardt R.K. Carmi R. Sheffield V.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We next investigated the ionic nature of the TRPM6-induced currents. Using NaCl-based extracellular solutions containing low millimolar concentrations of CaCl2 and/or MgCl2, the outwardly rectifying TRPM6-induced currents reversed close to 0 mV (e.g. Fig. 2, c and e). Substitution of extracellular Cl– by aspartate did not alter the reversal potential or amplitude of the outward currents (data not shown), excluding a significant contribution of Cl– fluxes to the observed currents. Likewise, substitution of extracellular Na+ by the large cation N-methyl-d-glucosamine (NMDG+) did not change the shape of the current-voltage relation or the inward current amplitude; with both Mg2+ and Ca2+ at 2 mm in the extracellular solution, the inward current density at –80 mV was –13.6 ± 2.2 pA/pF and –13.7 ± 2.3 pA/pF (n = 4) in the presence of 150 mm Na+ and NMDG+, respectively. These results indicate that the inward current is almost exclusively carried by Mg2+ and/or Ca2+. However, large inward currents were observed upon removal of all extracellular divalent cations, yielding slightly inwardly rectifying currents that reversed close to 0 mV with identical NaCl-based solutions on either side of the membrane (Fig. 2e). Subsequent substitution of extracellular Na+ by NMDG+ virtually abolished inward currents, shifting the reversal potential to voltages more negative than –50 mV (Fig. 2e). Thus, in the absence of divalent cations, the TRPM6-induced channel becomes highly permeable to Na+. Outward currents were strongly reduced when NMDG+ was the sole cation in the intracellular solution, indicating that the large outward currents observed with the NaCl-based intracellular solutions are mainly carried by Na+ (Fig. 2f). Thus, the outwardly rectifying current-voltage profile of the TRPM6-induced current measured with physiological concentrations of extracellular divalent cations reflects the small inward flux of divalent cations and the large outward flux of monovalent cations. Given that TRPM6 is expressed in Mg2+-absorbing epithelia and that mutations in the TRPM6 gene cause HSH, we further tested the permeability of the TRPM6-induced channel to Mg2+ and other divalent cations. Significant inward currents were measured with all tested divalent cations, each acting as the sole charge carrier in the extracellular solution (Fig. 3a). At a concentration of 20 mm, the permeation rank order determined from the inward current amplitude at –80 mV was Ba2+ ≥ Ni2+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ (Fig. 3a, inset). When normalized to the inward current amplitude in 20 mm Ca2+, we obtained relative values of 2.02 ± 0.18, 1.81 ± 0.22, and 1.33 ± 0.09 for Ba2+, Ni2+, and Mg2+, respectively (n = 4–7). The divalent cations had a differential blocking effect on the outward currents, and the rank order of blocking efficiency was Ni2+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Ba2+ (Fig. 3a). We also estimated permeability ratios (PX/PNa) based on the reversal potentials (Erev) measured with the respective divalent cations (each 20 mm) in the extracellular solution and 150 mm intracellular Na+. This procedure yielded a different permeation sequence (respective PX/PNa values in parentheses), namely Ni2+ (9.2 ± 0.3) > Mg2+ (9.0 ± 0.4) > Ca2+ (6.9 ± 0.3) > Ba2+ (6.2 ± 0.2). It is, for two reasons, questionable whether these PX/PNa values adequately describe the permeability properties of TRPM6. First, the slope of the current-voltage relation is very shallow around Erev in the presence of extracellular divalent cations. Exact measurements of Erev are therefore difficult and error prone, because small changes in background current can have significant effects on Erev. Second, the calculation of PX/PNa from Erev is based on the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equations, which assume that ions permeate independently and that the electric field in the membrane is constant (14.Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar, 12.Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). However, the outward rectification of the TRPM6-induced current is much stronger than predicted by these equations, which makes the validity of these assumptions highly questionable. To further substantiate the Mg2+ permeability of the TRPM6-induced channel, we measured changes in the intracellular Mg2+ concentration directly using the Mg2+-sensitive ratiometric dye Magfura-2. In these experiments, cells were dialyzed with a Magfura-2-containing pipette solution devoid of Mg2+ and EDTA (see “Experimental Procedures”), which resulted in basal intracellular Mg2+ concentrations between 0.05 and 0.1 mm (Fig. 3b). The addition of 5 mm Mg2+ to the extracellular solution, which contained 2 mm Ca2+ during the entire course of the experiment, resulted in a significant increase of the intracellular Mg2+ concentration in TRPM6-expressing cells (Fig. 3b). Intracellular Mg2+ was increased further with higher extracellular Mg2+ concentrations or when the plasma membrane was hyperpolarized to –80 mV (Fig. 3b), consistent with Mg2+ influx through the TRPM6-induced channel. It is generally assumed that the luminal concentration of free Mg2+ in the Mg2+-absorbing part of the nephron is in the range of 0.2– 0.7 mm (1.Dai L.J. Ritchie G. Kerstan D. Kang H.S. Cole D.E. Quamme G.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 51-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To preferentially conduct Mg2+ in the presence of Ca2+, which is present at a concentration of ∼1mm, the apical Mg2+ influx pathway should exhibit a higher affinity for Mg2+ than for Ca2+. As a first approach to investigating whether the TRPM6-induced current satisfies this requirement, we compared the sensitivity of monovalent TRPM6-induced currents to Mg2+ and Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 3c, inward Na+ currents were blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by low micromolar concentrations of both Mg2+ and Ca2+. However, Mg2+ blocked the inward currents at lower concentrations than Ca2+ (Fig. 3, c and d). The dose-response curves for block of Na+ current at –80 mV yielded KD values of 1.1 and 4.8 μm and Hill coefficients of 0.85 and 0.83 for Mg2+ and Ca2+, respectively. The most straightforward explanation of the difference in KD values between Mg2+ and Ca2+ is that Mg2+ binds with a higher affinity to a binding site in the channel pore. Alternatively, the inhibitory effect of divalent cations on the permeation of monovalent cations might be due to a regulatory divalent cation binding site outside the pore, but this is highly unlikely given the strong voltage dependence of the block by Mg2+ and Ca2+. Thus, although the relative contribution of Mg2+ and Ca2+ to the inward current under physiological conditions is hard to estimate and expected to vary with changes in their respective extracellular concentrations, these data indicate that the pore of the TRPM6-induced channel has a higher affinity for Mg2+ than for Ca2+. This contrasts with all known Ca2+-selective channels (15.Hess P. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 14.Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar), including members of the TRP superfamily (16.Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which generally display a 10–1000 times lower affinity for Mg2+ than for Ca2+. Monovalent currents were highly sensitive to ruthenium red (RR), a potent blocker of several members of the TRPV family (17.Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7090) Google Scholar, 18.Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3e, 10 μm RR caused a strong inhibition of inward monovalent currents while leaving outward currents unaltered. Fig. 3f summarizes the voltage and concentration dependence of the block of monovalent currents by RR. The RR concentration for half-maximal current inhibition increased from ∼100 nm at –120 mV to >10 μm at potentials more positive than –20 mV. Such voltage dependence is generally interpreted as a direct block of the channel pore within the transmembrane electrical field. Interestingly, we found that inward currents carried by 10 mm Mg2+ were significantly less sensitive to inhibition by RR (40 ± 7% block at –80 mV with 10 μm RR; n = 4), suggesting that Mg2+ and RR compete with each other for one or more binding sites within the channel pore. Alternatively, Mg2+ might have an allosteric effect on the RR binding site. TRPM6-induced currents increased significantly upon dialysis with Mg2+-free intracellular solutions (e.g. Fig. 2a), indicating that intracellular Mg2+ has an inhibitory effect on TRPM6 activity. To test the effect of intracellular Mg2+ in a more direct manner, we performed experiments in which the intracellular Mg2+ concentration was directly altered in a spatially uniform manner using flash photolysis of the photolabile Mg2+chelator DM-nitrophen (19.Kaplan J.H. Ellis-Davies G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6571-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Fig. 4a shows an experiment in which a TRPM6-expressing cell was intracellularly dialyzed with a pipette solution containing 5 mm DM-nitrophen 90% saturated with Mg2+ as well as the Mg2+-sensitive dye Magfura-2. After maximal activation of the current, a brief flash (∼1 ms) of UV light was applied to the cell and the tip of the patch pipette, which resulted in a stepwise increase of the intracellular Mg2+ concentration from < 0.1 mm to ∼0.5 mm (Fig. 4a, top). As a result of the increased intracellular Mg2+, the TRPM6-induced current was significantly reduced, both at positive and negative potentials (Fig. 4a, bottom). We observed two temporal phases in the Mg2+-induced current reduction. As shown in Fig. 4b, the outward current at +100 mV rapidly decreased after the flash-induced increase in intracellular Mg2+ with an initial time constant of 24 ± 5 ms at 0.51 ± 0.07 mm Mg2+ (n = 5). Thereafter, a second, slower phase of inhibition was observed, which was complete in ∼ 30–40 s (time constant 21 ± 3 s; n = 5). Fig. 4c compares current-voltage relations obtained just before and, respectively, 5 and 45 s after the flash, illustrating that the inhibitory effect of intracellular Mg2+ displays little or no voltage dependence. Fig. 4d displays the relative current 45 s after the flash in the function of the post-flash Mg2+ concentration. The solid line (Fig. 4d) represents a dose-response curve fitted to the data, which yielded an apparent KD of 0.51 mm and a Hill coefficient of 2.1. Most of our experiments were performed with a pipette solution containing 10 mm EDTA, which causes slow passive depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Given that several members of the TRP family have been shown to be store-dependent (4.Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), we reasoned that part of the current activation after establishment of the whole-cell configuration might reflect store dependence of TRPM6. To test this possibility, we measured whole-cell currents using a Mg2+-free pipette solution containing 0.1 mm EGTA as the sole Ca2+ buffer, which is not sufficient to cause significant store depletion within the time course of our experiments. Under this condition, TRPM6-expressing cells still developed robust outwardly rectifying currents, and the average current density (319 ± 58 pA/pF; n = 8) was not different from that of cells dialyzed with the standard solution containing 10 mm EDTA (341 ± 24 pA/pF; n = 42; see Fig. 1b). Moreover, depletion of the intracellular stores by extracellular application of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor 2,5-di-t-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (20 μm) or the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (2 μm) did not alter the amplitude of the TRPM6-induced currents measured with 0.1 mm EGTA in the pipette solution (n = 3 for each drug; data not shown). From this we conclude that the activity of TRPM6 does not critically depend on the filling state of the intracellular Ca2+ stores. The TRPM6-induced currents are highly reminiscent of the currents induced by overexpression of TRPM7 in HEK-293 or Chinese hamster ovary cells (5.Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 13.Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) as well as to the outwardly rectifying currents regulated by intracellular Mg2+ and/or Mg2+-nucleotides that are present in cell types (including HEK-293 cells) that endogenously express TRPM7 and have been termed MagNuM (for Mg2+-nucleotide-inhibited) or MIC (Mg2+-inhibited cation) currents (13.Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A.

Physiol. 2002; 120: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The list of similarities between the TRPM6-induced currents and the TRPM7, MagNuM, or MIC currents includes the outwardly rectifying current-voltage relation, the lack of voltage dependence, and the sensitivity to intracellular Mg2+. This raises the important question of whether the currents described in this study are mediated by TRPM6 itself or rather represent the activity of the endogenously expressed TRPM7. However, this possibility is rather unlikely for the following reasons. First, current amplitudes in TRPM6-expressing cells were ∼10 times larger than in non-transfected cells, and developed much faster when intracellular Mg2+ was buffered. Second, no significant increase in outwardly rectifying currents was observed upon overexpression of two HSH-causing TRPM6 mutants. Finally, the average current density in TRPM6-expressing HEK-293 cells measured in this study was of the same order of magnitude and even larger than those reported for HEK-293 or CHO cells overexpressing TRPM7 under comparable experimental conditions (5.Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 13.Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R.

Thus, the most straightforward explanation of our findings is that TRPM6 forms all or a major part of a Mg2+-permeable cation channel regulated by intracellular Mg2+. TRPM6 and TRPM7 have an overall amino acid sequence identity of 52%, which increases to >80% in the region between the fifth and sixth transmembrane region where the pore-forming loop is presumably located. Moreover, both TRPM6 and TRPM7 have a carboxyl-terminal region with sequence similarities to the atypical α-kinase family. Given this high degree of homology, it cannot be excluded that TRPM6 and TRPM7 are able to form heterotetrameric channels, similar to what has been described for TRPV5/TRPV6 (24.Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema A.F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and TRPC1/TRPC5 (25.Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). However, the 10-fold larger current amplitude in the TRPM6-expressing cells compared with non-transfected HEK-293 cells indicates that the majority of the channels are actually TRPM6 homotetramers. As a consequence of our findings, some caution is warranted when equating endogenous MagNuM (MIC) currents to TRPM7, as TRPM6 or putative TRPM6-TRPM7 heteromultimers might underlie these currents in some cell types. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that TRPM6 confines a Mg2+-permeable channel that is specifically localized to the apical membrane of Mg2+-reabsorbing tubules in the kidney and the brush-border membrane of the Mg2+ absorptive cells in the duodenum. The tight regulation of the TRPM6-induced current by intracellular Mg2+ provides a feedback mechanism on Mg2+ influx and implies that intracellular Mg2+ buffering and Mg2+ extrusion mechanisms strongly impact on channel functioning. Parvalbumin and calbindin-D28K, which, as shown in this work, are co-expressed with TRPM6, might function as intracellular Mg2+ chelators in the DCT, although further studies are needed to substantiate this. To our knowledge, TRPM6 represents the first molecularly identified and functionally characterized component of active Mg2+ (re)absorption. The absence of the TRPM6-dependent Mg2+ influx pathway in kidney and the small intestine provides a straightforward explanation for the severe hypomagnesemia observed in HSH patients. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2088382964,"In the brain, hippocampal pyramidal cells use temporal as well as rate coding to signal spatial aspects of the animal's environment or behaviour. The temporal code takes the form of a phase relationship to the concurrent cycle of the hippocampal electroencephalogram theta rhythm. These two codes could each represent a different variable. However, this requires the rate and phase to vary independently, in contrast to recent suggestions that they are tightly coupled, both reflecting the amplitude of the cell's input. Here we show that the time of firing and firing rate are dissociable, and can represent two independent variables: respectively the animal's location within the place field, and its speed of movement through the field. Independent encoding of location together with actions and stimuli occurring there may help to explain the dual roles of the hippocampus in spatial and episodic memory, or may indicate a more general role of the hippocampus in relational/declarative memory."

Incubated soleus and EDL muscle from whole-body α2- or α1-AMPK knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice were incubated with 2.0 mm AICAR or electrically stimulated to contraction. Both AICAR and contraction increased 2DG uptake in WT muscles. KO of α2, but not α1, abolished AICAR-induced glucose uptake, whereas neither KO affected contraction-induced glucose uptake. AICAR and contraction increased α2- and α1-AMPK activity in wild type (WT) muscles. During AICAR stimulation, the remaining AMPK activity in KO muscles increased to the same level as in WT. During contraction, the remaining AMPK activity in α2-KO muscles was elevated by 100% probably explained by a 2–3-fold increase in α1-protein. In α1-KO muscles, α2-AMPK activity increased to similar levels as in WT. Both interventions increased total AMPK activity, as expressed by AMPK-P and ACCβ-P, in WT muscles. During AICAR stimulation, this was dramatically reduced in α2-KO but not in α1-KO, whereas during contraction, both measurements were essentially similar to WT in both KO-muscles. The results show that α2-AMPK is the main donor of basal and AICAR-stimulated AMPK activity and is responsible for AICAR-induced glucose uptake. In contrast, during contraction, the two α-isoforms seem to substitute for each other in terms of activity, which may explain the normal glucose uptake despite the lack of either α2- or α1-AMPK.

Therefore, it is tempting to ascribe a role for AMPK in muscle metabolism in response to exercise, and in particular investigators have hypothesized a role for AMPK in contraction-stimulated glucose uptake (11.Hayashi T.

Activation of AMPK by exercise or drugs seems to have important therapeutic possibilities in the fight against conditions characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity such as type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. This view is supported by findings showing that short term activation of AMPK by AICAR increases insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle (29.Fisher J.S. Gao J. Han D.H. Holloszy J.O. Nolte L.A. Am. J.

Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and diabetic ob/ob and db/db mice (31.Halseth A.E. Ensor N.J. White T.A. Ross S.A. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Lund S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), possibly by increasing the level of GLUT4 protein and various oxidative enzymes in skeletal muscle (34.Winder W.W.

Physiol. 1999; 87: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of isolated mouse skeletal muscles overexpressing a kinase dead AMPK construct showed that AICAR- and hypoxia-stimulated glucose uptake was totally abolished, whereas contraction-stimulated glucose uptake was lowered by 30–40% (36.Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). This clearly indicates dissimilarities between AICAR/hypoxia- and contraction-stimulated glucose transport in that AMPK is only partially responsible for contraction to stimulate muscle glucose transport. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex consisting of a catalytic α-subunit and regulatory β- and γ-subunits. Two isoforms have been identified of the α-subunit (α1 and α2) and β-subunit (β1 and β2) and three isoforms of the γ-subunit (γ1, γ2, and γ3) (37.Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. Gao G. Widmer J.

J. 2000; 346: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). To date, it is not known which of the two catalytic α-isoforms convey the effects on glucose transport in skeletal muscle. It is also not known which of the two isoforms constitute the dominant isoform in skeletal muscle. These questions are important from a physiological point of view but also because design of drugs targeting AMPK may be facilitated if the precise α-AMPK isoform responsible for the desired metabolic effects is known. To investigate this further, AMPK was activated by AICAR or contraction in muscles consisting of predominantly slow or fast twitch fiber types from mice that do not express either the α2- or α1-AMPK isoform. Here we show that AICAR stimulation of muscle glucose uptake requires the presence of the α2-isoform, whereas, in this respect, the α1-isoform is of no relevance. In contrast, neither of the two knockouts markedly decreases contraction-stimulated glucose uptake. A mouse 129-strain genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with a specific mouse AMPK catalytic α1-subunit 500-bp fragment made by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on liver messenger RNA using the forward 5′-AGGGCCCGACACACCCTAGA-3′ and the reverse 5′-TGTGACTTCCTGGTCTTGGA-3′ primers. One genomic clone encompassing a 14.5-kb genomic fragment was used to generate the targeting construct. This fragment contains the exons encoding the N terminus catalytic domain of the α1-AMPK subunit corresponding to amino acids 31–239. A 4-kb HincII-BpmI 5′ homologous genomic fragment was blunted, modified by the addition of NotI linkers, and subcloned into the 5′ NotI site of the previously reported IRES-βgeo (40.Vallet V.S. Casado M. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20175-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This plasmid was SalI-digested, and the 3′ α1 homologous fragment, consisting of a 3-kb SacI-SacI fragment, was inserted. The resulting targeting construct was linearized at the unique XhoI site and 40 μg was used to electroporate 1 × 107 embryonic stem cells (ES cells; a kind gift from Anne K. Voss, Gottingen, Germany), which were cultured on mitomycin-treated embryonic fibroblast feeder layers. DNA from clones surviving G418 selection (200 μg/ml) was individually analyzed on Southern blot. DNA was EcoRI-digested and hybridized either with a 5′ external probe consisting of a genomic SalI-HincII fragment or with a 3′ external probe consisting of a SacI-SacI genomic fragment (Fig. 1A). Positive ES cells were injected into blastocysts derived from C57BL/6J mice, and chimeric males were mated to wild type C57BL/6J females for the germ line transmission as previously described (41.Vallet V.S.

Mice heterozygous for the gene targeting event were then used to generate the homozygous α1-AMPK mutant mice. α2-AMPK genomic clones were isolated after screening a mouse 129 strain genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The targeting construct was generated by flanking exon C, which encodes the α2-AMPK catalytic domain with loxP sites for the Cre recombinase and inserting a phosphoglycerol kinase promoter-driven neomycin selection cassette flanked by an additional loxP site. The generation of the α2-AMPK knockout mouse and its phenotype has recently been described elsewhere; for details, see Viollet et al. (42.Viollet B. Andreelli F. Jorgensen S.B. Perrin C. Geloen A. Flamez D. Mu J. Lenzner C. Baud O. Bennoun M. Gomas E. Nicolas G. Wojtaszewski J.F. Kahn A. Carling D. Schuit F.C. Birnbaum M.J. Richter E.A. Burcelin R. Vaulont S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). All experiments were approved by the Danish Animal Experimental Inspectorate and complied with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experiments and Other Scientific Purposes (Council of Europe 123, Strasbourg, France, 1985). Four-month-old male and female α1-AMPK knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice as well as male α2-AMPK KO and WT mice were studied. Within each strain, KO and WT mice used for experiments were littermates produced by intercross-breeding using heterozygote parent animals. The genotype of the offspring was first determined by PCR on DNA extracted from a tail biopsy tested against positive control samples. The lack of α-AMPK protein was later verified by immunoblotting on samples from muscle tissue. The mice were maintained on a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle and received standard rodent chow (Altromin 1324, Chr. Pedersen A/S, Ringsted, Denmark) and water ad libitum. Tolerance tests were performed on both α2- and α1-AMPK KO and corresponding WT mice. Glucose (2 g/kg), insulin (0.5 units/kg; Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark), or AICAR (250 mg/kg; Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto, CA) was given intraperitoneally at time 0 (isotonic solutions). Tail blood was collected at –20, 20, 40, 60, 105, and 150 min, and blood glucose concentration was determined using a glucometer (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Mice were semifasted before the glucose and AICAR tolerance test (received 40% of daily food intake 18 h prior to test) but were fed before the insulin tolerance tests. Area under the curve (AUC; mm·min) is calculated from the changes in blood glucose concentration at time point 20–150 min compared with basal value at time –20 min. Soleus (mainly slow twitch fibers) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL; mainly fast twitch fibers) were obtained from anesthetized mice (6 mg of pentobarbital 100 g–1 body weight) and suspended by ligatures at resting tension (4–5 millinewtons) in incubation chambers (Multi Myograph system; Danish Myo-Technology, Aarhus, DK) in a Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 30 °C (42.Viollet B. Andreelli F. Jorgensen S.B. Perrin C. Geloen A. Flamez D. Mu J. Lenzner C. Baud O. Bennoun M. Gomas E. Nicolas G. Wojtaszewski J.F. Kahn A. Carling D. Schuit F.C. Birnbaum M.J. Richter E.A. Burcelin R. Vaulont S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). AICAR Stimulation—AICAR (2 mm, 40 min, Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto, Canada) was added after 10 min of basal incubation. Contraction—After 40 min of basal incubation, contraction was induced by electrical stimulation with a 10-s train (100-Hz, 0.2-ms impulse, ∼30 V) per min for 10 min. After incubation, muscles were harvested, washed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer, blotted on filter paper, and quickly frozen with aluminum tongs precooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. In some experiments, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) uptake was measured by adding 2-[2,6-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (1 mm) and [1-14C]mannitol (8 mm) (Amersham Biosciences) to the medium (specific activities of the two tracers in the medium were 0.128 and 0.083 μCi ml–1, respectively). During AICAR incubation, 2DG uptake was measured during the last 10 min of incubation. During muscle contraction, 2DG uptake was measured during the last 5 min of muscle contraction and the first 5 min into recovery (42.Viollet B. Andreelli F. Jorgensen S.B. Perrin C. Geloen A. Flamez D. Mu J. Lenzner C. Baud O. Bennoun M. Gomas E. Nicolas G. Wojtaszewski J.F. Kahn A. Carling D. Schuit F.C. Birnbaum M.J. Richter E.A. Burcelin R. Vaulont S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the supernatant was measured using liquid scintillation counting (Tri-Carb 2000; Packard Instrument Co.). Muscles were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris base, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 mm benzamidine, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.4) for 20 s using a homogenizer (PT 3100; Brinkmann Instruments). Homogenates were rotated end over end for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were generated by centrifugation (17,500 × g) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Protein content in lysates was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Protein levels of the α1- and α2-AMPK subunits were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies generated in sheep as described by Woods et al. (43.Woods A. Salt I. Scott J. Hardie D.G. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (antibodies were kindly donated by D. G. Hardie, University of Dundee, UK). ACCβ protein was accessed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (DakoCytomatione, Glostrup, Denmark) as described by Wojtaszewski et al. (44.Wojtaszewski J.F. Mourtzakis M. Hillig T. Saltin B. Pilegaard H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). GLUT4 protein was assessed in total crude membrane using polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the mouse GLUT4 C terminus sequence (Chemicon International Inc.) as described by Ploug et al. (45.Ploug T. Wojtaszewski J. Kristiansen S. Hespel P. Galbo H. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E270-E278PubMed Google Scholar). α-AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation was measured by immunoblotting using a phosphospecific antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). ACCβ Ser227 phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting using a phosphospecific antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). This antibody is raised against a peptide corresponding to the sequence in rat liver ACCα around the Ser79 phosphorylation site, but the antibody also recognizes the mouse ACCβ when phosphorylated most likely on the corresponding Ser227. Muscle lysate protein was loaded on 7.5% Tris-HCl Criterion gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon Transfer Membrane, Millipore A/S, Glostrup, DK) by semi-wet blotting. Membranes were blocked in TBST containing 1 or 2% low fat milk protein for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature (rabbit anti-sheep immunoglobulins, horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Bands were visualized using an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 440CF and enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL+). Bands were quantified using Kodak 1D 3.5 software, and protein content was expressed in relative units in comparison with control samples loaded on each gel. α-Isoform-specific AMPK activity was measured in vitro in immunoprecipitates from 100 μg of muscle lysate protein using anti-α1 and anti-α2 antibodies. The protocol was identical to the one previously described (7.Wojtaszewski J.F. Nielsen P. Hansen B.F. Richter E.A. Kiens B. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) except for the kinase reaction time (45 min). Muscle glycogen content was determined as glycosyl units after acid hydrolysis (46.Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, London1972: 1-291Google Scholar). Mice were starved for 5 h (from 5:00 to 10:00 p.m.), samples were obtained from tail blood, and serum insulin was assessed using a rat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit with a mouse insulin standard (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago, IL). Contraction force was measured by a force transducer connected to one end of the muscle by the ligature. Force generated was registered on a computer and was expressed as the average force generated (above resting tension) during the 10 stimulation periods. The degree of “fatigue” was obtained by comparing the mean contraction force during stimulation trains 8–10 with the first stimulation train and is expressed as the percentage decrease in mean contraction force. Control samples were added to both kinase activity assays and immunoblots, and assay-to-assay variation was accounted for by expressing the data relative to these samples. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was performed by two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements or Student's two-tailed t test. When analysis of variance revealed significant differences, the Student-Newman-Keuls method was used as a post hoc test to correct for multiple comparisons. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant if p was <0.05. Generation of α-AMPK Knockout Mice—The description of the α2-AMPK KO mice is published elsewhere; for details, see Viollet et al. (42.Viollet B. Andreelli F. Jorgensen S.B. Perrin C. Geloen A.

Invest. 2003; 111: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In order to inactivate the AMPK catalytic α1-subunit gene, a replacement vector was constructed with 7 kb of ES-129-derived genomic fragment and a selection cassette deleting part of the catalytic domain of α1-AMPK from amino acids 97–157 (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, hybridization of EcoRI-digested genomic DNAs with the indicated 5′ external probe led to WT alleles of 5.5 kb and mutated alleles of 5.0 kb. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C) of protein extracts prepared from α1-AMPK knockout liver and skeletal muscle showed undetectable α1-protein and a level of α2-protein comparable with that observed in extracts from WT mice. α1-, α2-, ACCβ-, and GLUT4-protein Levels—Gene targeting for either the α2- or α1-subunit resulted in complete lack of expression of these subunits at the protein level (Table I and Fig. 2). In the α2 knockout muscles, a compensatory 200–300% increase in the protein level of the remaining α1-isoform was observed in EDL and soleus. In the α1-KO soleus muscles, a ∼60% increase in the remaining α2-isoform was observed, whereas no change was seen in EDL. The protein level of ACCβ was also measured in the two muscles and was expressed to the same level in both of the two knockout strains (Table I and Fig. 2). The GLUT4 protein content was measured in the gastrocnemius muscle and was expressed to the same level in both of the two knockout strains (Table II and Fig. 2).Table Iα1-, α2- and ACCβ-protein levels in EDL and soleus muscles from α1- or α2-AMPK knockout miceMuscleGenotypeProtein contentα2α1ACCβEDLα2-WT1.4 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.1α2-KOND1.9 ± 0.3*0.6 ± 0.1Soleusα2-WT0.7 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.2α2-KOND3.3 ± 0.5*1.2 ± 0.2EDLα1-WT2.3 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.1α1-KO2.3 ± 0.3ND1.0 ± 0.1Soleusα1-WT0.7 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1α1-KO1.1 ± 0.1*ND1.5 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Table IIGLUT4 protein level in gastrocnemius muscle from α1- or α2-AMPK knockout miceMuscleProtein contentGenotypeGLUT4Gast.α2-WT1.8 ± 0.2α2-KO2.1 ± 0.3Gast.α1-WT1.8 ± 0.4α1-KO1.9 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Phenotype of Knockout Mice—A detailed description of the α2-AMPK KO mouse phenotype has been published recently (42.Viollet B.

https://openalex.org/W2060471386,"The first stars in the Universe are predicted to have been much more massive than the Sun. Gravitational condensation, accompanied by cooling of the primordial gas via molecular hydrogen, yields a minimum fragmentation scale of a few hundred solar masses. Numerical simulations indicate that once a gas clump acquires this mass it undergoes a slow, quasi-hydrostatic contraction without further fragmentation; lower-mass stars cannot form. Here we show that as soon as the primordial gas--left over from the Big Bang--is enriched by elements ejected from supernovae to a carbon or oxygen abundance as small as approximately 0.01-0.1 per cent of that found in the Sun, cooling by singly ionized carbon or neutral oxygen can lead to the formation of low-mass stars by allowing cloud fragmentation to smaller clumps. This mechanism naturally accommodates the recent discovery of solar-mass stars with unusually low iron abundances (10(-5.3) solar) but with relatively high (10(-1.3) solar) carbon abundance. The critical abundances that we derive can be used to identify those metal-poor stars in our Galaxy with elemental patterns imprinted by the first supernovae. We also find that the minimum stellar mass at early epochs is partially regulated by the temperature of the cosmic microwave background."
https://openalex.org/W2050630298,"The relationship between dNTP levels and DNA synthesis was investigated using α factor-synchronized yeast treated with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). Although HU blocked DNA synthesis and prevented the dNTP pool expansion that normally occurs at G1/S, it did not exhaust the levels of any of the four dNTPs, which dropped to about 80% of G1 levels. When dbf4 yeast that are ts for replication initiation were allowed to preaccumulate dNTPs at 37 °C before being released to 25 °C in the presence of HU, they synthesized 0.3 genome equivalents of DNA and then arrested as dNTPs approached sub-G1 levels. Accumulation of dNTPs at G1/S was not a prerequisite for replication initiation, since dbf4 cells incubated in HU at 25 °C were able to replicate when subsequently switched to 37 °C in the absence of HU. The replication arrest mechanism was not dependent on the Mec1/Rad53 pathway, since checkpoint-deficient rad53 cells also failed to exhaust basal dNTPs when incubated in HU. The persistence of basal dNTP levels in HU-arrested cells and partial bypass of the arrest in cells that had preaccumulated dNTPs suggest that cells have a mechanism for arresting DNA chain elongation when dNTP levels are not maintained above a critical threshold.

Hydroxyurea (HU) 1The abbreviations used are: HU, hydroxyurea; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase. is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and inhibits DNA replication in a wide variety of cells, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1.Slater M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 263-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for HU inhibition of DNA synthesis is that it starves the DNA polymerase at the replication forks for dNTPs. HU treatment has been shown to reduce the purine dNTP pools in a variety of mammalian cells (2.Skoog L. Nordenskjold B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3.Skoog L. Bjursell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6434-6438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Adams R.L. Berryman S.

Furthermore, even for purine dNTPs, HU has only rarely been shown to cause a complete depletion of the dGTP or dATP pools (2.Skoog L. Nordenskjold B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3.Skoog L. Bjursell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6434-6438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Adams R.L. Berryman S.

The complicated, often reciprocal, changes in individual dNTP pools that occur in HU-treated mammalian cells may be due to the compensatory activities of deoxyribonucleotide salvage pathways in higher eukaryotes. Budding yeast offers a simpler system in which to study the mechanism by which HU affects replication. Yeast possess no deoxyribonucleoside kinase activities, and thus deoxyribonucleotide synthesis is entirely dependent on ribonucleotide reductase. Also, yeast can easily be synchronized in G1 using mating pheromone, and the availability of several temperature-sensitive cdc mutations allows cell cycle progression to be reversibly halted at specific points throughout the cell cycle (8.Hereford L.M. Hartwell L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 84: 445-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Reciprocal switch experiments in yeast have ordered the execution point of several cdc genes with respect to the HU-sensitive step during the cell cycle (9.Hartwell L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutational screens in yeast have identified regulatory proteins, such as Mec1 and Rad53, that are necessary for proper execution of the HU-induced replication arrest checkpoint (10.Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Despite the genetic advantages of S. cerevisiae, the relative simplicity of its dNTP synthesis pathway, and the well studied transcriptional control of its dNTP-synthesizing genes (11.McIntosh E.M.

Zhao et al. (16.Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) showed that deletion of Sml1, a Mec1/Rad53-regulated protein that binds and inhibits RNR, results in dNTP pool expansion.

Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) showed that RNR1 gene mutations that free RNR enzyme from allosteric feedback inhibition result in elevated dNTP levels and increased resistance to DNA-damaging agents. There is no published information on the effects of HU on dNTP levels in yeast. In mammalian cells, the mechanism by which HU inhibits replication has been investigated by attempting to reverse HU inhibition by administration of exogenous deoxyribonucleosides (20.Lagergren J. Reichard P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2985-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21.Adams R.L. Lindsay J.G. J. Biol.

In yeast, the absence of deoxyribonucleotide salvage enzymes makes it difficult to assay the ability of exogenous deoxyribonucleosides to reverse the effects of HU. However, the availability of cdc mutants that cannot initiate S phase at the nonpermissive temperature represents a potential means of genetically elevating dNTP levels prior to application of HU. The Dbf4 polypeptide, together with Cdc7, forms a heterodimeric protein kinase that is essential for replication initiation (23.Sclafani R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Dbf4/Cdc7-requiring process is the last genetically identified step in the pathway linking START to replication origin firing (23.Sclafani R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used a mutant dbf4 strain to investigate whether preaccumulation of dNTPs bypasses the inhibitory effect of HU on replication. The dbf4 strain was used to test another aspect of the relationship between dNTP accumulation and replication initiation. In yeast (18.Koc A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Merrill G.F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), experiments have shown that dNTPs accumulate as synchronized cells enter S phase. The concomitant accumulation of dNTPs and synthesis of DNA suggests that there might be a link between the initiation of these two events. In the current study, we tested whether a threshold level of dNTPs was needed for replication initiation by releasing α factor-arrested dbf4 yeast into HU medium at the permissive temperature and then monitoring their ability to replicate when switched to the nonpermissive temperature in the absence of HU. A similar reciprocal switch experiment in which DNA synthesis and cell division were monitored has already established that Cdc7, the protein with which Dbf4 interacts, acts prior to the HU-sensitive step during the cell cycle (9.Hartwell L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This suggests that dNTP accumulation is not required for replication initiation. However, in this and all other previous reciprocal switch experiments involving HU and cdc mutations, dNTP levels were never measured. Furthermore, although Cdc7 has been analyzed, that Dbf4 acts prior to HU in preventing replication has not formally been shown. The checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53 act sequentially in a pathway that, among other things, appears to boost or preserve dNTP levels in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents or HU. In response to DNA damage, the Mec1/Rad53 pathway positively regulates RNR activity in at least three ways. It stimulates transcription of the large and small subunit RNR genes (27.Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It is needed for the redistribution of the RNR small subunit (Rnr2) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it can join with the large subunit (Rnr1) to form the holoenzyme (28.Yao R. Zhang Z. An X. Bucci B. Perlstein D.L. Stubbe J. Huang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It inactivates the RNR inhibitor Sml1 (16.Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 29.Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R.

The Mec1/Rad53 pathway also negatively regulates replication origin activity in HU-treated cells. In wild-type yeast, HU blocks DNA chain initiation at late replication origins (27.Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 31.Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In rad53 mutants, HU does not block the firing of late origins (31.Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 32.Lengronne A. Pasero P. Bensimon A. Schwob E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The occurrence of DNA synthesis at late origins in rad53 cells suggested that HU-treated cells must have a residual pool of dNTPs. To determine the extent to which dNTP pools fall in HU-treated cells, the levels of all four dNTPs were determined in synchronized wild-type and rad53 cells incubated in the absence and presence of HU. Our analyses showed that, although HU prevented dNTP accumulation at G1/S and blocked DNA synthesis, it did not exhaust the basal dNTP pools. HU inhibition of replication was bypassed if dbf4 cells were allowed to preaccumulate dNTPs at the nonpermissive temperature prior to exposure to the drug at the permissive temperature. Accumulation of dNTPs was not a prerequisite for replication initiation, since dbf4 cells released from α factor into HU at the permissive temperature were able to replicate when switched to the nonpermissive temperature in the absence of HU. Finally, the arrest mechanism was not dependent on the Mec1/Rad53 pathway, since HU treatment did not exhaust the dNTP pools in checkpoint-deficient rad53 mutants. Our results suggest that cells have evolved a mechanism for arresting DNA chain elongation when dNTP falls below a minimum threshold. Elongation arrest may represent a means of conserving basal dNTPs for processes such as DNA repair. Media, Strains, and General Methods—Cells were grown in YEPD medium. Yeast strains used are listed in Table I. MY273 and SY2626 are derivatives of W303-1 that carry a bar1 mutation to facilitate α factor synchronization. To derive MY273, W303-1α was mated to SY2626 (G. Sprague, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR), and a MATα segregant carrying the bar1 allele was isolated by tetrad dissection. To derive the dbf4-1 bar1 strain MY317, MY273 was mated to L128-20 (L. Johnston, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, UK), and random spores from the resulting diploid were screened for α factor and temperature sensitivity. To derive the rad53-11 bar1 strain MY376, MY273 was mated to BS883 (R. Sclafani, University of Colorado Medical Center, Denver, CO), and tetrads from the resulting diploid were dissected and tested for α factor sensitivity and uracil prototrophy. (The rad53-11 mutation was linked to pep4:URA3.) The wild-type RAD53 strain (MY377) was derived from the same tetrad used to derive MY376.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeSourceW303-1aMATa ade2 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 can1Ref. 42.Wallis J.W.

To achieve synchrony, arrested cells were collected on Whatman #1 filters, washed once with fresh YEPD and once with 100% conditioned medium, resuspended in 25% conditioned medium, and incubated at either 25 or 37 °C. Conditioned medium was prepared by growing W303-1a cells to saturation in YEPD and removing the cells by filtration. Flow Cytometry—About 5 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. After microcentrifugation (10,000 rpm, 5 s), the cell pellet was washed with 100 μlof50mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 7), resuspended in 100 μl of sodium citrate buffer, and sonicated for 6 s. After a 1-h incubation at 55 °C with RNase A (0.25 mg/ml) and a 1-h incubation with proteinase K (1 mg/ml), 100 μl of sodium citrate buffer containing 16 μg/ml propidium iodide was added, and samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight in the dark. A Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer was used to analyze the samples. For each histogram, 25,000 cells were assayed. dNTP Pool Measurements—Approximately 3 × 108 cells were harvested and extracted as described by Muller (15.Muller E.G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each precipitated sample was resuspended in 200 μl of cold H2O and assayed for each of the four dNTPs by the DNA polymerase-based enzymatic assay (33.North T.W. Bestwick R.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6640-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is based on the incorporation of a limiting dNTP into an alternating co-polymer template poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC) by Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of an excess of 3H-labeled complementary dNTP. HU Prevents dNTP Accumulation at G1/S in α Factor-synchronized Yeast—Wild-type cells (MY377) were synchronized by α factor arrest and release. As shown by the flow cytometry data in Fig. 1A, asynchronously growing cells arrested with a G1 DNA content when incubated with α factor, and arrested cells entered S phase about 40 min after α factor was removed. Parallel dNTP pool measurements (Fig. 1B) showed that the levels of all four dNTPs were lower in G1-arrested cells than in asynchronous cells and that the levels of all four dNTPs increased 2.5–4-fold as cells entered S phase. The relative size of each dNTP pool differed reproducibly, with dTTP always being the largest and dGTP always being the smallest. For example, 108 asynchronous cells contained 293 pmol of dTTP, 183 pmol of dATP, 74 pmol of dCTP, and 65 pmol of dGTP. Assuming a cell volume of 42 fl (34.Jorgensen P. Nishikawa J.L. Breitkreutz B.J. Tyers M. Science. 2002; 297: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), the concentrations of dTTP, dATP, dCTP, and dGTP were 70, 44, 18, and 15 μm, respectively. HU has been shown to alter the dNTP pools of mammalian cells through its interaction with ribonucleotide reductase (2.Skoog L. Nordenskjold B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3.Skoog L. Bjursell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6434-6438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Adams R.L. Berryman S. Thomson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 240: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5.Tyrsted G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 3107-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In general, the purine dNTP pools are the most strongly affected by HU; however, in experiments using different mammalian cells, the effects of HU on individual dNTP pools varied quantitatively and qualitatively. Yeast represented a system where cell synchrony could be easily achieved and where the effects of HU on individual dNTP pools as cells entered S phase could be determined. In particular, we were interested in determining whether any dNTP pool was exhausted as cells began replicating. As shown by the flow cytometry data in Fig. 1C, when α factor-arrested MY377 cells were released to fresh medium containing HU, DNA content did not increase, confirming that HU blocked replication. As shown in Fig. 1D, HU prevented the accumulation of dNTPs that normally began about 40 min after α factor release in the absence of HU (see Fig. 1B). The result suggested that HU blocked the synthesis of all four dNTPs in yeast. HU affected the dNTP pools evenly and did not significantly change the ratios of the pools relative to each other. For example, the dTTP/dATP/dCTP/dGTP ratio was 39:19:11:10 before release into HU medium and was 45:20:13:10 after 1 h in HU. After 80 min in HU, the pools had decreased 21% for dTTP, 18% for dATP, 29% for dCTP, and 15% for dGTP. On average, dNTP pools contracted to about 79% of G1-arrested levels. Thus, although HU completely blocked DNA replication, it had only a modest effect on dNTP levels. Preaccumulation of dNTPs Permits Replication in the Presence of HU—The persistence of significant dNTP pools in HU-treated yeast belied the simple idea that replication arrest in HU was due to exhaustion of the substrates needed for chain elongation by DNA polymerase. Careful examination of the results of earlier studies in mammalian cells showed similar persistence of dNTPs and suggested that HU can inhibit replication without exhausting a bulk dNTP pool. Several alternative explanations for HU-induced replication arrest are conceivable. First, cells may have a mechanism for sensing the size of the dNTP pools and halting replication fork progression when a dNTP pool falls to a low, but non-zero, level. Second, inhibition of RNR may completely exhaust a privileged dNTP pool at replication forks and yet only mildly affect the bulk dNTP pools measured in whole cells. Third, inhibition of flux through RNR may inhibit replication by a dNTP-independent mechanism. For example, inhibition of RNR activity may affect the redox state of the co-substrate thioredoxin, and thereby affect the activity of regulatory proteins that are sensitive to the redox state of thioredoxin. Fourth, although RNR is the only characterized target of HU, the drug may affect the activity of an as yet uncharacterized target that is required for replication fork progression. The latter three of these explanations predict that HU should continue to block replication if a means of artificially raising the bulk dNTP pools were achieved. The first of these explanations predicts that cells should be able to bypass the HU-induced replication block if a means of raising the bulk dNTP pools were achieved. As a means of raising the bulk dNTP pools in yeast, we investigated the use of a temperature-sensitive dbf4 mutation. Dbf4, together with Cdc7, forms a holoenzyme with protein kinase activity. The Dbf4/Cdc7 protein kinase is located at replication origins and catalyzes the last known step in the cascade of events linking START to replication origin firing (23.Sclafani R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C), dbf4 mutants arrest at G1/S with unfired origins of replication. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained when α factor-arrested dbf4 mutants were released from pheromone at the nonpermissive temperature in the absence of HU and were subsequently switched to the permissive temperature in the presence of HU. Previous continuous labeling studies, in which [14C]uracil incorporation into DNA was monitored, indicated that HU inhibits DNA synthesis in yeast within 10 min of its administration (9.Hartwell L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To ensure that HU had adequate time to enter the cell and inactivate RNR, the drug was added 20 min before the temperature shift down. Fig. 2B shows that all four dNTP pools decreased when asynchronous dbf4 cells (black bars) were arrested in G1 with α factor and that all four dNTP pools increased 2.4–4.4-fold when α factor was removed and cells were incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) for 80 min (shaded bars, labeled 20, 40, 60, and 60 + 20). Expansion of the dNTP pools at the nonpermissive temperature implied that the mechanism responsible for increased dNTP synthesis in late G1 was not dependent on Dbf4. Having preaccumulated dNTPs at 37 °C, would dbf4 cells switched to the permissive temperature be able to synthesize DNA in the presence of HU? The decrease in dNTP levels that was observed when cells were given HU at 60 min and switched to 25 °C at 80 min (Fig. 2B, open bars labeled 60 + 20, 60 + 40, 60 + 60, 60 + 80, and 60 + 100) was consistent with the idea that DNA synthesis was occurring and that dNTPs were being consumed through their incorporation into DNA. Flow cytometry was used to directly monitor DNA synthesis in cells released from a dbf4 block in the presence of HU. As shown in Fig. 2A, dbf4 cells arrested with a G1 DNA content when incubated in α factor, and they did not enter S phase for at least 60 min when α factor was removed and cells were incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C). However, when cells were given HU at 60 min and switched to the permissive temperature (25 °C) at 80 min (60 + 20), they began to synthesize DNA. By 20 min after the temperature shift-down (60 + 40), DNA content had increased 27% above G1 levels. By this time, dNTP pools had fallen to nearly G1 levels (see Fig. 2B). By 40 min after the temperature shift down (60 + 60), DNA content had increased by 30%, and dNTP pools had fallen to G1 levels. With longer incubations, out to 80 min after the temperature shift down (60 + 100), DNA content had not increased further, and dNTP pools in general had fallen to a constant, non-zero level. The data in Fig. 2, A and B, indicate that when cells were allowed to preaccumulate dNTPs before HU was added, they were able to replicate about 30% of their genome in the presence of the drug. Then, once dNTPs had dropped to about G1 levels, DNA synthesis once again became arrested. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, it was important that HU be added several minutes prior to the temperature shift-down. If HU was added simultaneously with the temperature shift-down, many cells seemed to replicate almost their entire genome. We speculate that when HU is added at the same time as the temperature shift-down, significant amounts of DNA were synthesized before HU had entered the cell and inhibited RNR activity. From the results in Fig. 2, we concluded that preaccumulation of dNTPs allowed cells to replicate 30% of their genome in the presence of HU. The result was inconsistent with models in which the HU-induced replication arrest was due to an effect of HU on a privileged dNTP pool, on the redox state of RNR co-substrates such as thioredoxin, or on an as yet uncharacterized target of the drug. The results support a model in which DNA replication in yeast requires a critical dNTP threshold, below which replication forks are arrested. According to this model, HU blocks replication because, in the absence of RNR activity, cells cannot maintain their dNTP pools above the threshold required to prevent replication arrest. Deoxyribonucleotide Accumulation Is Not Required for Dbf4 Activity—Although the data in Fig. 2 showed that Dbf4 activity was not required for dNTP accumulation at G1/S, the reciprocal question of whether dNTP accumulation was required for Dbf4 activity at G1/S has not formally been addressed. To investigate this question, dNTP levels and DNA content were measured in α factor-synchronized dbf4 cells released from pheromone at the permissive temperature in the presence of HU and subsequently switched to the nonpermissive temperature in the absence of HU. To ensure that Dbf4 protein was inactivated prior to restoration of RNR activity, cells were switched to the nonpermissive temperature 10 min before HU was removed. As shown in Fig. 3B, dbf4 cells released from pheromone at the permissive temperature in the presence of HU did not accumulate dNTPs (open bars, labeled 20, 40, and 60). When subsequently switched to the nonpermissive temperature in the absence of HU, the cells gradually accumulated dNTPs over the next 60 min (shaded bars, labeled 60 + 20, 60 + 40, and 60 + 60). Parallel flow cytometric determination of DNA content (Fig. 3A) showed that cells remained with a G1 DNA content during the initial 60-min incubation at the permissive temperature in the presence of HU and that most cells acquired a G2 DNA content during a subsequent 60-min incubation at the nonpermissive temperature in the absence of HU. The increase in DNA content at the nonpermissive temperature shows that the majority of cells were able to traverse the Dbf4 execution point during the initial incubation at the permissive temperature, although HU was present and prevented dNTP accumulation. Since the execution point for the Dbf4/Cdc7 kinase lies very close to t"

This argues for a common ancestral apoptotic system in eukaryotes.

A very important goal is to determine which molecular components may be used in the execution of PCD in plants, which have been conserved during evolution, and which are plant-specific. Using Arabidopsis thaliana, we have shown that UV radiation can induce apoptosis-like changes at the cellular level and that a UV experimental system is relevant to the study of PCD in plants. We report here that UV induction of PCD required light and that a protease cleaving the caspase substrate Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVDase activity) was induced within 30 min and peaked at 1 h. This DEVDase appears to be related to animal caspases at the biochemical level, being insensitive to broad-range cysteine protease inhibitors. In addition, caspase-1 and caspase-3 inhibitors and the pan-caspase inhibitor p35 were able to suppress DNA fragmentation and cell death. These results suggest that a YVADase activity and an inducible DEVDase activity possibly mediate DNA fragmentation during plant PCD induced by UV overexposure.

Whether and how light is required for activating cell death or for its execution are not yet clear. Despite these specificities, some cellular aspects appear to be conserved in animals and plants, including DNA fragmentation (laddering), protoplast shrinkage, and chromatin condensation (8.Danon A. Delorme V. Mailhac N. Gallois P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38: 1-9Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, caspase-like activities have been detected in plants (9.Woltering E.J. Van Der Bent A. Hoeberichts F.A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1764-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In animals, caspases are specifically activated during PCD. In particular, caspases initiate cell death by degrading several proteins essential for cell integrity (e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase), lamins, and gelsolin). Caspase activities can be measured using fluorogenic peptide substrates and can be blocked by the same peptide substrates coupled to an aldehyde. Caspase-like activities have been detected and measured in plant PCD induced during hypersensitive response (HR) (10.del Pozo O. Lam E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) or after a heat shock of suspension cells (11.Tian R. Zhang G. Yan C. Dai Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In support of a role for these caspase-like activities in plant PCD, experiments in tobacco showed that, during PCD induced by menadione in protoplasts, caspase inhibitors can block the induction of DNA fragmentation and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (12.Sun Y. Zhao Y. Hong X. Zhai Z.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Caspase inhibitors (Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO) have also been shown to block PCD after pathogen induction (10.del Pozo O. Lam E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Expression of p35, a caspase inhibitor, has been reported to reduce the onset of apoptosis in embryonic callus in maize (13.Hansen G. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This protein specifically inhibits caspases in insects, nematodes, and humans by blocking their active sites (14.Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 15.Bertin J. Mendrysa S. Lacount D. Gaur S. Krebs J. Amstrong R. Tomaselli A. Friesen P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Key amino acid residues essential for inhibitor function have been identified using point mutations (15.Bertin J. Mendrysa S. Lacount D. Gaur S. Krebs J. Amstrong R. Tomaselli A. Friesen P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that transgenic tomato plants bearing the p35 gene are protected against Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici (Aal)-toxin-induced death and pathogen infection, confirming that p35 can suppress PCD in plants (16.Lincoln J.E. Richael C. Overduin B. Smith K. Bostock R. Gilchrist D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15217-15221Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The possible common origin of PCD in multicellular organisms and the conservation of some features of apoptosis might be expected to be partially reflected at a molecular level. However, despite the completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence, only a few plant genes have been identified as orthologs of mammalian genes involved in apoptosis, e.g. At-BI1 (Arabidopsis thaliana BAX Inhibitor-1) (17.Kawai M. Pan L. Reed J.C. Uchimiya H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18.Sanchez P. de Torres Zabala M. Grant M. Plant J. 2000; 21: 393-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); At-DAD1 (A. thaliana Defender against Apoptotic Death-1) (19.Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima K. Shibata Y. Komiyama S.

The plant Bax inhibitor is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and overexpression of the Bax inhibitor has recently been shown to suppress pathogen-induced plant PCD (22.Matsumura H. Nirasawa S. Kiba A. Urasaki N. Saitoh H. Ito M. Kawai-Yamada M. Uchimiya H. Terauchi R. Plant J. 2003; 33: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23.Bolduc N. Ouellet M. Pitre F. Brisson L.F. Planta. 2003; 216: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Finally, although there are no caspase orthologs, it has been proposed that plant metacaspases are homologous and functionally equivalent to animal caspases (24.Uren A. O'Rourke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.D. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967EAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have show in a previous report that UVC stress induces apoptosis-like changes in Arabidopsis (25.Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These include detection of a DNA ladder, changes in nucleus morphology (crescent shape), and nucleus fragmentation. In protoplasts, DNA fragmentation was detected using the TUNEL reaction and correlated with the onset of cell death measured using a vital dye (25.Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). UVC radiation has often been used to study various physiologically relevant responses to DNA damage; and in particular, it has been shown to induce apoptosis in animal cells (26.Kulms D. Schwarz T. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 2000; 16: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). UV radiation can damage many aspects of plant processes at the physiological and DNA levels (27.Jansen M. Gaba V. Greenberg B. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (813) Google Scholar), and our study showed that this cellular damage can trigger PCD in response (25.Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that cell death induced by UVC can be inhibited specifically by caspase inhibitors and is possibly mediated by caspase-like activities that cleave Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVDase) or Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp (YVADase). The DEVDase activity was induced prior to DNA fragmentation detected by the TUNEL reaction, and caspase inhibitors blocked the onset of DNA fragmentation. Using protoplast transfection, we show here that the DNA fragmentation induced by UVC can be suppressed by transient overexpression of p35 or At-DAD genes. These findings confirm that UV-induced cell death is a form of PCD and suggest a role for At-DAD or for ER stress in the PCD of plants. Plant Material—Seeds from A. thaliana (Columbia 0) were sterilized, sown under aseptic conditions on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog salts and vitamins (Duchefa Ltd.) supplemented with 20 g/liter glucose, and grown at 21 °C with a 14-h photoperiod. Protoplast Preparation—A. thaliana leaf protoplasts were isolated from 3-4-week-old seedlings essentially as described (25.Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28.Gallois P. Lindsey K. Malone R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 89-108PubMed Google Scholar). After isolation, protoplasts were resuspended in culture medium (Murashige and Skoog salts and vitamins supplemented with 0.4 m sucrose, 0.4 m mannitol, and 100 mg/liter cefotaxime) at a density of 106 protoplasts/ml. For each treatment, 106 protoplasts were used and then incubated in one 15-ml tube (Sarstedt, Inc.). Sequence Determination and Analysis—Sequences of the At-DAD2 gene were obtained by PCR walking on plant genomic DNA using four different primer sequences (5′-CTTTGTTCACTTGAATCCGGAGGCAG-3′, 5′-GTAAACTAACCAGCAAGAACCGCTGTCCCG-3′, 5′-GGTAACGAACTCCTACAGTTTCTTCAACTCC-3′, and 5′-GCAGGATTTAGCACCTGAGAGAGCTTTTGC-3′) following the method of Devic et al. (29.Devic M. Albert S. Delseny M. Plant J. 1996; 9: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At-DAD2 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using primers 5′-CAGCGAGAGCACCAGACTCG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTCTTCACATAAGGGC-3′. DNA was sequenced using an ABI 373 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems Ltd.) and analyzed using DNA Sequencer (Gene Codes Corp.). Plasmid Constructions—At-DAD1 cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number X95585) was excised from a library prepared in the λ-ZAP vector (Stratagene). At-DAD2 cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF030172) was cloned in the pMOSBlue vector (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids p35S::At-DAD1 and p35S::At-DAD2 were constructed by inserting a BamHI/SphI fragment from the cDNA construction into the BamHI/SphI sites of the pDH51 plasmid (a gift of Dr. Paszkowski, Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland). p35S::p35 was constructed by inserting an XbaI/SacI fragment from the pPRM-35K-ORF mammalian expression vector containing p35 cDNA (a gift of Professor P. Friesen, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) into the XbaI/SacI sites of the pBI221 plasmid. p35S::p35-D87A was generated using p35S::p35 and primers according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The pRTL2-GUS plasmid (a gift of Professor James Carrington, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX) was used as a transfection control. To obtain an At-DAD1-GFP fusion, At-DAD1 cDNA was amplified using PCR primers 3′-GFP:F (CAGTCCATGGTGAAATCGACGAGTAA) and 3′-GFP:R (CAGTCCATGGCTCCGAGGAAGTTGATGATCA), which add a new NcoI site to either end of At-DAD1 cDNA. The At-DAD1 PCR product was digested using NcoI (Roche Applied Science) and cloned into the NcoI site immediately 5′ to the EGFP coding sequence in the pK100 construct. The resulting p35S::DAD1-EGFP cassette was then excised using HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site of the plant binary vector pPZP111b (a gift of Dr. S. Michaels, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and used in onion bombardment experiments. pK100 was created by excising the EGFP-1 gene (Clontech) with NcoI/NotI and cloning into the multiple cloning site of the pDH51 vector. pEGFPer was created by adding a basic chitinase secretion peptide and the ER retention signal KDEL to EGFP. 2R. Blanvillain, unpublished data. Protoplast Transfection—For transfection, protoplasts were resuspended at 106 protoplasts/ml in 0.4 m mannitol, 15 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% MES (pH 5.6) and kept for 30 min on ice. Protoplasts were then mixed with 50 μg of plasmid DNA in a 6-well Petri dish (Corning), and 1 ml of 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG) was carefully added. Protoplasts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and washed sequentially three times for 5 min with 2, 4, and 8 ml of W5A (25.Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) solution. Protoplasts were then pelleted at low speed centrifugation (60 × g, 5 min), resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium, and cultured for 24 h at room temperature. Transfection efficiency was between 40 and 60%. A transfection control using β-glucuronidase assays was routinely carried out. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Transgene Expression—Total RNA was extracted from aliquots of protoplasts transfected with various plasmids using the Invitek kit (Invisorb). 5 μg of total RNA was treated with 5 units of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) in a 40-μl total volume. cDNAs were obtained using the PRO STAR™ first-strand RT-PCR kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction with the following modifications. 1.2 μl of oligo(dT) primer was added to 2 μg of total RNA in a final volume of 15.2 μl in Milli-Q water. In the fourth step of the protocol, the reagent volumes were reduced by 2.5-fold. Absence of transfected plasmid or genomic DNA in the cDNA samples was verified by PCR amplification without a reverse transcription step. Semiquantification of target transcripts was carried out using PCR and gene-specific primers, selecting a number of cycles in the linear range of amplification. Actin-2 (GenBank™/EBI accession number U41998) was used as a reference gene to compare expression levels in different batches. UVC Irradiation of Plants and Protoplasts—Seedlings were irradiated in open Petri dishes (9-cm diameter; Corning) using a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) fitted with 254-nm UVC light bulbs. Protoplasts were irradiated in an open 6-well Petri dish at 106 protoplasts/ml of culture medium. For caspase inhibition experiments, 105 protoplasts in 100 μl of culture medium were irradiated in an open 6-well Petri dish. Seedling and protoplasts were kept in white light: 400-700 nm, 100 μmol m-2 s-1 (OSRAM L 36W/21-840 Hellweiss Lumilux Cool White) after UV treatment unless stated otherwise. A UVC sensor fitted inside the Stratalinker irradiation chamber measured the UVC energy delivered in each experiment. The UVC doses used varied between 10 and 50 kJ/m2. The UVC bulbs used emit a sharp wavelength band centered at 253.7 nm. In Situ Detection of Cell Death Using Evans Blue—Protoplast samples to be analyzed were incubated with 0.04% Evans blue for 5 min. Blue cells were scored as dead cells using a light microscope. In Situ Detection of Nuclear DNA Fragmentation—The TUNEL reaction was carried out on fixed protoplasts according to Danon and Gallois (25.Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The protoplasts on slides were viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan) using an FITC Blue 450-490 filter (Zeiss). For each sample, photographs of multiple microscopic fields were taken, and TUNEL-positive nuclei were scored on prints. Effect of Caspase Inhibitors in Vivo—Protoplasts were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a caspase inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO or Ac-YVAD-CHO (100 μm); Bachem Ltd.) and irradiated with 10 or 15 kJ/m2 UVC. After various incubation times, protoplasts were harvested and incubated in the presence of Evans blue or fixed for the TUNEL reaction. Protein Extraction and Caspase-like Activities—A. thaliana seedlings were grown for 3 weeks in Petri dishes (9-cm diameter) and then irradiated with 50 kJ/m2 UVC and incubated under our standard culture conditions. At different time points, the plants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder with a mortar and pestle. The powder was collected in 1.5-ml tubes and kept at -80 °C until processing. The samples were then resuspended in assay buffer (20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton, 10 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 50 mm sodium acetate) and incubated with 200 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC or Ac-YVAD-AMC (Bachem Ltd.). AMC fluorescence was detected using a Labsystems Fluoroskan II every 5 min during a 1-h reaction. The enzymatic activity was calculated as the slope of the product concentration as a function of time. This activity was then standardized to the quantity of total proteins present in the sample (Bradford assay, Bio-Rad). For inhibitor assays, samples were resuspended in assay buffer and incubated for 1 h with a caspase inhibitor (DEVD-CHO or YVAD-CHO (200 μm); Bachem Ltd.) or with a protease inhibitor (pepstatin A (3 mm), leupeptin (4 mm), or E-64 (10 μm); all from Sigma). Extracts were then incubated with the substrate DEVD-AMC (200 μm). Transfection of Onion Cells—Microprojectiles and DNA were prepared according to Hull et al. (30.Hull G.A. Garcia Garrido J.M. Parcy F. Menossi M. Martinez Izquierdo J.A. Gallois P. Plant Sci. 1996; 120: 153-160Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Pieces of onion epidermis still attached to the ground tissue were placed on Petri dishes containing MS30 medium solidified with 10 g/liter Bacto-agar. Bombardments were carried out according to Hull et al. (30.Hull G.A. Garcia Garrido J.M. Parcy F. Menossi M. Martinez Izquierdo J.A. Gallois P. Plant Sci. 1996; 120: 153-160Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and onion cells were incubated in the dark for 24 h at 22 °C. The epidermis was peeled off, and GFP-positive cells were observed with a Leica fluorescence microscope under blue wavelength excitation light using an FITC Blue 450-490 filter. UV-induced PCD Is Light-dependent—To examine the effect of light on PCD induced by UVC, 5-day-old seedlings were subjected to increasing amounts of UVC and kept in the dark or in the light for 72 h. In the light, seedlings developed an obvious bleaching of their leaves with doses of 10 kJ/m2 and above. In contrast, seedlings kept in the dark showed no bleaching (Fig. 1A). There was still no bleaching of seedlings kept in the dark for up to 7 days (data not shown). To confirm that bleaching was a measure of cell death, the same treatment was applied to protoplasts prepared from seedlings, and cell death was measured by Evans blue, a marker of plasma membrane integrity. Dead protoplasts accumulated the dye, whereas live protoplasts excluded the dye (Fig. 1B). When treated with UV and kept in the light, up to nearly 100% of the protoplast population was scored dead. The death rate in the dark was as little as 10% and comparable with untreated samples, although treated protoplasts appeared shrunken compared with untreated protoplasts (Fig. 1C). DEVDase and YVADase Activities in UV-irradiated Seedlings—To assess whether cell death in UV-irradiated plants is partially homologous to animal PCD at the molecular level, we assayed for caspase-1-like activity, a protease that cleaves the substrate Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp (YVADase), and caspase-3-like activity, a protease that cleaves the substrate Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVDase). Caspase-like activities were tested in extracts from irradiated and untreated seedlings using two caspase substrates: Ac-DEVD-AMC and Ac-YVAD-AMC (200 μm). YVADase activity was present in untreated plant extracts, and no induction of YVADase activity was detected after UVC irradiation (data not shown). In contrast, induction of DEVDase activity was detected 30 min after irradiation and reached a peak at 1 h (Fig. 2A). Various protease inhibitors were tested to assign this DEVDase activity to a specific class of proteases. The protein extract was preincubated for 1 h with caspase inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO (200 μm) before adding the substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (200 μm). This final concentration is in the range used in animal studies. Inhibition with broad-spectrum cysteine and serine protease inhibitors that do not inhibit animal caspases was also tested: pepstatin A (3 mm), leupeptin (4 mm), or E-64 (10 μm). Inhibitor analysis (Fig. 2B) showed that the DEVDase activity was totally inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO and only partially by Ac-YVAD-CHO or by pepstatin A and leupeptin. E-64 had little effect on DEVDase activity, in agreement with inhibition data for animal caspases (31.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.U. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that cysteine proteases of non-caspase families (papain and legumain) are involved in PCD in plants (reviewed in Ref. 32.Lam E. del Pozo O. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that legumain can cleave Ac-YVAD-AMC, a substrate specific for caspase-1 (33.Rotari V.I. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). But in contrast to DEVDase activity, the activity of these two families of cysteine proteases were suppressed after UVC radiation (data not shown). In the experiments presented here, the assay buffer used contained PMSF (serine protease inhibitor) and EDTA (metalloprotease inhibitor), two class-specific inhibitors that do not inhibit animal caspases. The inhibitors are used to distinguish possible plant caspase-like activities from other protease activities. In the absence of inhibitors in the assay buffer, there was a background activity in the non-induced samples that masked the activation of the DEVDase activity (data not shown). In the presence of the chosen inhibitors, the background activity was reduced, and activation results were clearer. The use of class-specific inhibitors to assay caspase-like activity in crude extract is consistent with protocols used in studies of animal caspases. (i) Stennicke and Salvesen (34.Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that caspase substrates can be cleaved in crude extract by proteases other than caspases. (ii) PMSF (serine proteases) and EDTA (metalloproteases) do not inhibit animal caspases (31.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.U. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar, 35.Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). (iii) These inhibitors have been used in buffers to purify animal caspase-1 (35.Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Further experiments showed that, in contrast to animal caspases, which are active at pH 7, DEVDase was active at pH 5 (data not shown). The activity was also relatively insensitive to a salt concentration of up to 200 mm (Fig. 2B), which has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the detection of some caspase-like activity in plants (36.Korthout H. Berecki G. Bruin W. van Duijn B. Wang M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In conclusion, UVC radiation induced DEVDase activity, which was specifically inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO and which was not significantly affected by other protease inhibitors. YVADase activity was detected in both induced and non-induced tissues. DEVDase and YVADase Are Required for Induction of DNA Fragmentation and Cell Death—We have shown previously that, in plants, UVC radiation indirectly induces fragmentation of the genomic DNA, resulting in the formation of a DNA ladder (25.Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As in animal apoptosis, the rungs are multiples of 180 bp. This DNA fragmentation can also be detected in situ using the TUNEL reaction, which labels the free 3′-OH DNA extremities (25.Danon A. Gallois P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and constitutes a marker of plant PCD. In animal cells, caspase-3 activates the DNase responsible for the appearance of the DNA ladder. Having detected DEVDase and YVADase activities in Arabidopsis extracts, we therefore investigated a possible link between these activities, cell death, and DNA fragmentation. Caspase inhibitors were analyzed for their potential ability to block DNA fragmentation and to rescue UV-irradiated protoplasts. Protoplasts were prepared using 3-week-old seedlings grown in vitro, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a caspase inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO or Ac-YVAD-CHO (100 μm)), and subsequently irradiated with UVC. After 4 h of culture in the light, protoplasts were harvested, fixed, and analyzed for DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL reaction. Non-irradiated protoplasts showed a background of 10% TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 3A). This DNA fragmentation could be suppressed by YVAD-CHO and, to a lesser extent, by DEVD-CHO. Under the experimental conditions used, UV irradiation clearly induced DNA fragmentation, pushing it up to 35%. This induction could be totally prevented when protoplasts were preincubated with either of the two caspase inhibitors used. The same experiment was repeated, and cell death was measured using Evans blue. 4 h after UV treatment, cell death reached 60% in the control sample without inhibitors. Preincubation"
https://openalex.org/W1972345745,"Helicobacter pylori has been reported to induce interleukin-6 (IL-6) production in monocytes/macrophages and in chronically inflamed gastric tissues. The mechanism by which H. pylori induces IL-6 production in macrophages, however, has not been investigated. To identify the H. pylori factor responsible for this activity, we fractionated soluble proteins from H. pylori strain 26695 by ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography and screened the fractions for IL-6-inducing activity on RAW 264.7 macrophages. A single protein was purified and identified by mass spectrometry as H. pylori heat shock protein 60 (HSP60). Consistent with the observed IL-6-inducing activity of H. pylori HSP60, soluble protein extracts of H. pylori 26695 and SS1 strains that were depleted of this protein by affinity chromatography had dramatically reduced IL-6-inducing activities. The immunopurified HSP60 stimulated IL-6 production in macrophages. When stimulated with H. pylori HSP60 or intact bacteria, peritoneal macrophages from mice deficient in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, TLR-2/TLR-4, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 produced the same amount of IL-6 than macrophages from wild-type mice, demonstrating the independence of H. pylori HSP60 responses from these signaling molecules. H. pylori HSP60-induced IL-6 mRNA expression, and NF-κB activation in RAW 264.7 cells was abrogated in the presence of MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor. In contrast, inhibitors of protein kinase A or C, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase had no effect on IL-6 mRNA levels. This study demonstrates the induction of innate immune responses by H. pylori HSP60, thereby implicating this highly conserved protein in the pathophysiology of chronic gastritis.

When stimulated with H. pylori HSP60 or intact bacteria, peritoneal macrophages from mice deficient in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, TLR-2/TLR-4, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 produced the same amount of IL-6 than macrophages from wild-type mice, demonstrating the independence of H. pylori HSP60 responses from these signaling molecules. H. pylori HSP60-induced IL-6 mRNA expression, and NF-κB activation in RAW 264.7 cells was abrogated in the presence of MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor. In contrast, inhibitors of protein kinase A or C, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase had no effect on IL-6 mRNA levels. This study demonstrates the induction of innate immune responses by H. pylori HSP60, thereby implicating this highly conserved protein in the pathophysiology of chronic gastritis. The Gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium Helicobacter pylori colonizes mammalian stomachs, and its persistence in human tissues is linked to the development of chronic inflammation. Chronic gastritis is such a common feature of H. pylori infection that histopathologists commonly use this as a criterion for diagnosing the presence of H. pylori bacteria in gastric biopsies. In contrast, the development of peptic ulceration and gastric cancer in response to H. pylori infection is much less frequent, occurring in ∼10 and 1% of infections, respectively (1.Ley C. Parsonnet J. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 324-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Although there has been a concerted effort in the last decade to identify the bacterial factors that are associated with these severe forms of H. pylori related disease, little is currently known regarding those factors that induce chronic gastritis. One of the major H. pylori virulence factors is the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI), 1The abbreviations used are: cagPAI, cag pathogenicity island; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; PKA and PKC, protein kinases A and C, respectively; HSP, heat shock protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TLR, toll-like receptor; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; MG-132, Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO; H89, N-[2-((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide; Gö 6983, 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)5-methoxyindol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl) maleimide; MAPK kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; WT, wild-type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pam3Cys, S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2-RS)-propyl]-N-palmitoyl-(R)-Cys-(S)-Ser-Lys4-OH, trihydrochloride. which has been correlated with the more severe H. pylori associated pathologies and mediates its effects through gastric epithelial cells (2.Segal E.D. Lange C. Covacci A. Tompkins L.S. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although only a proportion of H. pylori strains harbor a cagPAI, all of the cases of H. pylori infection are associated with the development of chronic gastritis. Therefore, it is likely that non-cagPAI factors promote chronic inflammation (3.Hansen P.S. Go M.F. Varming K. Andersen L.P. Graham D.Y. Nielsen H. Apmis. 1999; 107: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which inflammatory processes might occur is via the activation of antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, within the gastric mucosa. Indeed, professional phagocytes appear to play a role in the chronic inflammatory lesions associated with H. pylori infection (4.Sartor R.B. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 533-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Fu S. Ramanujam K.S. Wong A. Fantry G.T. Drachenberg C.B. James S.P. Meltzer S.J. Wilson K.T. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 1319-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as H. pylori LPS has a 100-fold lower biological activity to that of other Gram-negative bacteria (6.Moran A.P. Helander I.M. Kosunen T.U. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Birkholz S. Knipp U. Nietzki C. Adamek R.J. Opferkuch W. FEMS Immunol. Med.

Conversely, certain soluble proteins in H. pylori extracts have been reported to activate mononuclear cells in vitro (9.Mai U.E. Perez-Perez G.I. Wahl L.M. Wahl S.M. Blaser M.J. Smith P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 10.Gobert A.P. Mersey B.D. Cheng Y. Blumberg D.R. Newton J.C. Wilson K.T. J.

Dis. 2000; 181: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but the identities of these proteins and of their receptors, for the most part, remain unknown. Macrophage-derived cytokine production is strongly up-regulated during H. pylori infection (11.Harris P.R. Smythies L.E. Smith P.D. Dubois A. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These innate responses are principally characterized by increases in the expression levels of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6 in infected gastric tissues (11.Harris P.R. Smythies L.E. Smith P.D. Dubois A. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12.Crabtree J.E. Shallcross T.M. Heatley R.V. Wyatt J.I.

Strikingly, a relationship exists between H. pylori and IL-6 since IL-6 mRNA levels in the gastric mucosa have been correlated with the level of inflammation (11.Harris P.R. Smythies L.E. Smith P.D. Dubois A. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15.Yamaoka Y. Kita M. Kodama T. Imamura S. Ohno T. Sawai N. Ishimaru A. Imanishi J. Graham D.Y.

Wang S.R. Chao M.F. Wu T.C. Lui W.Y. K. P'Eng F. Chi C.W. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 91: 1417-1422PubMed Google Scholar). Normally, IL-6 plays an important role in host defense mechanisms as a messenger between innate and adaptive systems by stimulating interferon-γ production in T-cells, by promoting immunoglobulin secretion in activated B-cells, and via polymorphoneutrophil activation (17.Curfs J.H. Meis J.F. Hoogkamp-Korstanje J.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 742-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, IL-6 has been implicated in the control of virus or bacteria in vivo (18.Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). The findings above suggest that IL-6 could have critical functions for the pathophysiology of H. pylori infection. Thus, the aim of the current study was to identify novel H. pylori proteins capable of inducing IL-6 in macrophages. To this end, we fractionated a soluble cell extract of the genome-sequenced H. pylori 26695 strain by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography and tested the fractions for IL-6-inducing activity on RAW 264.7 cells. We have identified HSP60 as the main H. pylori factor inducing IL-6 release from murine macrophages through a signaling pathway involving NF-κB activation, but that is independent of TLR-2, TLR-4, or MyD88 signaling pathways. Materials—Pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB (MG-132), PKA (H89), PKC (Gö 6983), MAPK kinase (PD98 059), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (wortmannin) were purchased from Calbiochem. Materials for chromatography were from Amersham Biosciences. Highly purified H. pylori LPS was extracted by the phenol-water procedure after pretreatment of bacteria with Pronase E and subsequent purification by enzymatic treatments with RNase A, DNase II, and proteinase K and ultracentrifugation as described elsewhere (6.Moran A.P. Helander I.M. Kosunen T.U. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli LPS (19.Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jehanno M. Viala J. Tedin K.

Bacteria were maintained on blood agar base number 2 (Oxoid) plates containing 10% horse blood, 10 μg/ml vancomycin, 2.5 IU/liter polymyxin B, 5 μg/ml trimethoprim, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone under microaerobic conditions at 37 °C. Prior to each experiment, H. pylori was grown overnight in the same conditions by shaking at 140 rpm in Brain-Heart Infusion (Oxoid) liquid medium containing 0.2% β-cyclodextrin. The bacteria were washed twice and suspended in PBS. Bacterial density was estimated by spectrophotometry (A600) and by microscopic observation. H. pylori soluble proteins were obtained by vortexing 109 bacteria in 1 ml of water followed by three freeze-thaw cycles and by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford Assay. H. pylori urease activity was determined at A540 using urea-indole reagent (22.Labigne A. Cussac V. Courcoux P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1920-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Mice, Macrophages, and Culture Conditions—The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River. TLR-2, TLR-4, and MyD88 knock-out C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Professor S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and bred in the animal facilities of the Institut Pasteur. Double TLR-2/TLR-4 knock-out mice were generated by V. Balloy Resident peritoneal macrophages from these animals were purified as described previously (23.Gobert A.P. Semballa S. Daulouede S. Lesthelle S. Taxile M. Veyret B. Vincendeau P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4068-4072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments, RAW 264.7 cells or peritoneal macrophages were plated in 24-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) or in 6-well plates (2 × 106 cells/well) in the same medium for 2 h, washed, and stimulated with H. pylori with a multiplicity of infection of 10, with purified HSP60, with H. pylori or E. coli LPS, or with Pam3Cys. Cells were stimulated for the appropriate times (24 h for IL-6 assays, 6 h for mRNA analysis, and 5 h for NF-κB analysis). Column Chromatography of H. pylori Soluble Extracts—Soluble proteins of H. pylori 26695 (6.7 mg) were separated by ion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose High Performance column (80-ml bed volume) at pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl from 25 to 500 mm at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (4 ml) were collected from the column. Aliquots (20 μl) from fractions were then added to RAW 264.7 cells for 24 h, and IL-6 concentrations were determined in each cell-free supernatant. The fractions that induced IL-6 production were pooled, desalted, and concentrated with Centriprep YM-50 and Centricon YM-50 columns (Millipore). The resulting concentrate was subjected to further purification by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-100 column (2000-ml bed volume). Fractions (4 ml) were collected after elution with 400 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, and assayed on macrophages for IL-6-inducing activity. The corresponding fractions were pooled and concentrated. An aliquot was separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue or with silver nitrate. A protein band was extracted from the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry at the Plate-Form Technique 3 (Proteomic Genopole, Institut Pasteur). Immunopurification of H. pylori HSP60 —An AminoLink Plus immobilization kit (Pierce) was used to purify HSP60. 600 μg of H. pylori total soluble protein extracts were applied to an agarose column that had been coupled with 6 mg of a polyclonal antibody to H. pylori HSP60 (24.Ferrero R.L. Thiberge J.M. Kansau I. Wuscher N. Huerre M. Labigne A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed with PBS, and the flow-through was collected. HSP60 was eluted from the column using 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. The protein concentrations of the fractions were determined prior to concentration using Centricon YM-10 ultrafiltration units (Millipore). Determination of IL-6 Concentration—IL-6 levels were determined in macrophage supernatants using the Duo Set enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay development kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Measure of Endotoxin Contamination—LPS concentration was determined using the Limulus amebocyte lysate colorimetric assay QCL-1000 from BioWhittaker. Western Blotting—H. pylori proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by electro-blotting. Membranes were blocked for 2 h at 4 °C using PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Polyclonal antibody to HSP60 (1:50000) (24.Ferrero R.L. Thiberge J.M. Kansau I. Wuscher N. Huerre M.

Immun. 1994; 62: 4981-4989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:20000, Bio-Rad) were used each for 2 h at room temperature, respectively. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using Western blotting detection reagents ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Macrophage total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Subsequently, RNA (1 μg) from each sample was reverse-transcribed using 25 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and PCR was conducted using 2 μl of cDNA and 0.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). For IL-6, 15 pmol each of 5′ and 3′ primers were used with 3 pmol each of β-actin primers in a multiplex reaction. One PCR cycle consisted of the following: 94 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The total cycle numbers were 30. A final elongation step of 7 min at 72 °C was then used. Primer sequences were designed with Primer3 software (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) and were as follows: murine IL-6, 5′-AACGATGATGCACTTGCAGA-3′ and 5′-GAGCATTGGAAATTGGGGTA-3′; and murine β-actin, 5′-CCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCC-3′ and 5′-CTGTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAG-3′. PCR products (283 bp for IL-6 and 436 bp for β-actin) were run on 1.5% agarose gels with 0.4 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Stained bands were visualized under UV light and photographed with Image Master VDS (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensity was evaluated using NIH Image 1.63 program. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Macrophages were lysed with a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Suspensions were centrifuged at 1200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% w/v glycerol and were rapidly frozen and thawed three times. After centrifugation at 4000 × g at 4 °C for 12 min, supernatants containing nuclear proteins were removed and aliquot were used for protein determination. Nuclear extracts (1 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min with a DNA probe corresponding to the κB site of the H-2KB promoter (31.Innocenti M. Thoreson A.C. Ferrero R.L. Stromberg E. Bolin I. Eriksson L. Svennerholm A.M. Quiding-Jarbrink M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4581-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which had previously been biotin-labeled (Pierce). NF-κB activation was determined using a chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay technique (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analyses—The Student Newman-Keul's test was used for comparisons between multiple groups. The Student's t test was used for single comparisons between two groups. H. pylori HSP60 Is the Activator of IL-6 Production by Macrophages—To purify the H. pylori factor responsible for IL-6 synthesis by macrophages, soluble bacterial proteins were subjected to anion exchange chromatography. Fractions with IL-6-inducing activity on RAW 264.7 macrophages were identified (Fig. 1A), corresponding to fractions 88–124. Because urease is another major protein of H. pylori known to induce cytokine production by macrophages (26.Harris P.R. Ernst P.B. Kawabata S. Kiyono H. Graham M.F. Smith P.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 1516-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we determined the urease activity of the eluted fractions. Urease activity was detected in fractions 60–96 (Fig. 1A). To exclude the possible involvement of urease on IL-6 activation, only fractions (numbers 96–120) eluted after the urease peak were concentrated. The pooled fractions were subjected to size exclusion chromatography. The fractions tested for IL-6-inducing activity (Fig. 1B) (22.Labigne A. Cussac V. Courcoux P. J.

A single 55–60-kDa protein band was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1C). This protein was identified by mass spectrometry as being a homolog of E. coli GroEL, designated here as H. pylori HSP60 (also referred to as HspB) (24.Ferrero R.L. Thiberge J.M. Kansau I. Wuscher N. Huerre M. Labigne A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Urease activity was not detected in this purified extract, and no other bands were observed on the polyacrylamide gel after silver staining (data not shown). Immunopurification of H. pylori HSP60 —Because chaperone proteins of the HSP60 family have an essential function in bacteria, we did not attempt to inactivate the hsp60 gene. Instead, the involvement of H. pylori HSP60 on IL-6 stimulation was confirmed by an immunopurification approach. H. pylori HSP60 protein was detected in soluble protein extracts of H. pylori strains 26695 and SS1 (Fig. 2A). The concentration of HSP60, however, was dramatically decreased after immunopurification on a column coated with an anti-H. pylori HSP60 antibody (Fig. 2A). In addition, the HSP60 protein was detected in the concentrated eluates by Western blotting (data not shown). Conversely, the concentration of UreB in immunopurified extracts was not affected by chromatography (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the column specifically retained HSP60. IL-6 synthesis by RAW 264.7 macrophages was significantly increased following stimulation with soluble protein extracts of the two H. pylori strains when compared with unstimulated cells (data not shown). Nonetheless, IL-6 production was decreased by 88.8 ± 3.1 and 94.5 ± 1.9% when macrophages were activated with 2.5 μg/ml of the concentrated flow-through when compared with the stimulation with the same concentration of total H. pylori soluble proteins for 26695 and SS1 strains, respectively (Fig. 2B). A concentration-dependent increase in macrophage IL-6 production was observed in RAW 264.7 cells that had been stimulated with the immunopurified HSP60 (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Immunopurified HSP60 induces IL-6 production by RAW 264.7 cells. Macrophages were stimulated for 24 h with various concentrations of H. pylori HSP60. IL-6 concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the supernatants. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of one experiment performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We determined that immunopurified H. pylori HSP60 contained 15 enzyme units/ml, equivalent to 75 enzyme units of contaminating LPS for 400 ng of HSP60. When H. pylori and E. coli LPS, corresponding to the amounts detected in 400 ng of HSP60 preparation, were added to RAW 264.7 cells for 24 h, IL-6 concentrations were 0 and ∼200 pg/ml, respectively. IL-6 production by HSP60-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages was not altered by the use of 10 μg/ml polymyxin B, whereas IL-6 synthesis by macrophages activated with 1 μg/ml H. pylori LPS or with 10 ng/ml E. coli LPS was inhibited by ∼93 and ∼95% when polymyxin B was added to the cultures, respectively (data not shown). In addition, IL-6 production was inhibited by 93 ± 2,5% when RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with 400 ng/ml boiled HSP60 for 24 h compared with the stimulation with the same concentration of native H. pylori HSP60 (data not shown; p < 0.05, n = 2). Together, these results suggest that contaminating LPS is not responsible for IL-6 induction observed with the H. pylori HSP60. H. pylori and HSP60-induced Macrophage IL-6 Production Does Not Require TLR-2, TLR-4, or MyD88 —Previous reports have demonstrated that TLRs-MyD88 complexes may mediate the signaling of HSPs (27.Vabulas R.M.

To determine whether whole H. pylori and purified H. pylori HSP60 induce IL-6 production in macrophages through these signaling pathways, we stimulated peritoneal macrophages from WT, TLR-2–/–, TLR-4–/–, TLR-2–/–/TLR-4–/–, or MyD88–/– mice. As shown in Fig. 4A, IL-6 synthesis was induced by purified H. pylori HSP60 or by intact bacteria in primary cultures of WT mouse macrophages, demonstrating that IL-6 synthesis is not a property restricted to cell lines. In addition, IL-6 production in WT peritoneal macrophages was not significantly different from that observed in macrophages recovered from TLR-2–/–, TLR-4–/–, or MyD88–/– mice following stimulation with any of these factors (Fig. 4A). Conversely, a significant increase of IL-6 production was observed when macrophages from WT mice were stimulated with the TLR-2 ligand Pam3Cys (30.Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Suggett S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), whereas IL-6 was not synthesized by macrophages from TLR-2–/– mice activated with this compound (Fig. 4B). Additionally, macrophages from TLR-4–/– mice, which had been stimulated with E. coli LPS or H. pylori LPS, produced 93.3 ± 1.5 and 69.4 ± 18.5% lower amounts of IL-6 when compared with macrophages from WT animals, respectively (Fig. 4C). H. pylori- and HSP60-induced Macrophage IL-6 Expression Is NF-κB-dependent—The signaling mechanism responsible for IL-6 expression in macrophages was investigated. IL-6 mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells were up-regulated in response to purified HSP60 or to intact 26695 H. pylori (Fig. 5A) when compared with control macrophages. This increase was inhibited by 100 and ∼ 85% when the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was used on macrophages activated by HSP60 or by H. pylori, respectively. In contrast, H. pylori or HSP60-induced IL-6 mRNA expression was not affected by the use of H89, Gö 6983, PD98 059, and wortmannin, the specific inhibitors of PKA, PKC, MAPK kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, respectively. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, MG-132 treatment was also shown to abrogate the induction of NF-κB activation in HSP60-stimulated macrophages, thus confirming the role of"

We demonstrated previously that a plasma membrane NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity becomes up-regulated upon mitochondrial perturbation, and therefore suggested that it functions as a cellular redox sensor. VDAC1 is known to be expressed in the plasma membrane; however, its function there remained a mystery. Here we show that VDAC1, when expressed in the plasma membrane, functions as a NADH-ferricyanide reductase. VDAC1 preparations purified from both plasma membrane and mitochondria fractions exhibit NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity, which can be immunoprecipitated with poly- and monoclonal antibodies directed against VDAC(1). Transfecting cells with pl-VDAC1-GFP, which carries an N-terminal signal peptide, directs VDAC1 to the plasma membrane, as shown by confocal microscopy and FACS analysis, and significantly increases the plasma membrane NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity of the transfected cells. This novel enzymatic activity of the well known VDAC1 molecule may provide an explanation for its role in the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that a major function of VDAC1 in the plasma membrane is that of a NADH(-ferricyanide) reductase that may be involved in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis.

A number of electron transport systems have been shown to exist within cell membranes. The mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum electron transport chains are perhaps two of the best characterized systems in mammalian cells. However, little interest has been shown for the characterization of the members of the plasma membrane redox system (1Ly J.D. Lawen A. Redox. Rep. 2003; 8: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Evidence to support the existence of a plasma membrane NADH-oxidoreductase (PMOR) 1The abbreviations used are: PMORplasma membrane NADH-oxidoreductaseVDACvoltage-dependent anion-selective channelGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineHTPhydroxylapatiteFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingTBSTris-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.1The abbreviations used are: PMORplasma membrane NADH-oxidoreductaseVDACvoltage-dependent anion-selective channelGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineHTPhydroxylapatiteFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingTBSTris-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. or redox system arises from reduction of two artificial impermeable electron acceptors (potassium ferricyanide and dichlorophenolindophenol) by whole cells (2Larm J.A. Vaillant F. Linnane A.W. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30097-30100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of ferricyanide causes concomitant oxidation of cytosolic NADH (3Navas P. Sun I.L. Morré D.J. Crane F.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of an NADH-ferricyanide reductase in the plasma membrane. The importance of this plasma membrane redox system is exemplified by the fact that, during generation of human Namalwa ρ0 cells (which lack a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain), the rate of whole cell ferricyanide reduction increases ∼4-fold (2Larm J.A. Vaillant F. Linnane A.W. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30097-30100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these cells remain viable when ferricyanide is added to the media (4Martinus R.D. Linnane A.W. Nagley P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 997-1005PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a major role for the plasma membrane NADH-ferricyanide reductase in cell signaling and survival (5Baker M.A. Lawen A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2000; 2: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, little headway has been made in the identification and characterization of the proteins involved in plasma membrane redox function. Two redox enzymes have been suggested to be involved in plasma membrane electron transport from NADH to ferricyanide; however, both NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase flavoprotein (6Enoch H.G. Catala A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5095-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isozyme (7Bulliard C. Zurbriggen R. Tornare J. Faty M. Dastoor Z. Dreyer J.L. Biochem.

VDAC1 is a small, 30-35-kDa protein, predominantly found in the outer membrane of mitochondria (9Sorgato M.C. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 127-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), where it constitutes the major protein (10Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Predicted structural studies of human VDAC1 suggest the protein is a β-barrel, consisting of either 13 (11Song J. Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or 16 (12Casadio R. Jacoboni I. Messina A. De Pinto V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) membrane-spanning strands. VDAC1 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and has been suggested to be involved in forming the pore that releases cytochrome c during apoptosis (13Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). However, a recent report showed Bax-induced pore formation in yeast lacking VDAC (14Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H.-Y. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although VDAC1 is predominantly expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane, recently, it has been demonstrated by several groups that VDAC1 can also be expressed in the plasma membrane (15Thinnes F.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Dermietzel R. Hwang T.K. Buettner R. Hofer A. Dotzler E. Kremer M. Deutzmann R. Thinnes F.P. Fishman G.I.

Consistent with these observations, several patch clamp techniques have documented the presence of plasma membrane channels with physiological properties similar to VDAC1 (22Blatz A.L. Magleby K.L. Biophys. J. 1983; 43: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Jalonen T. Johansson S. Holopainen I. Oja S.S. Arhem P. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1989; 136: 611-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunocytochemical studies using antibodies raised against the N terminus of VDAC1 block a high conductance anion channel found in the plasma membrane of bovine astrocytes (16Dermietzel R. Hwang T.K. Buettner R. Hofer A. Dotzler E. Kremer M. Deutzmann R. Thinnes F.P. Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Siemen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These antibodies also appear to specifically label the plasma membrane in human B-lymphocytes. In vivo, VDAC1 harbors two alternative first exons, which leads to the expression of VDAC1 isoforms with different N-terminal sequences. One of these isoforms carries a leader sequence that directs the protein via the Golgi apparatus into the secretory pathway (19Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The other VDAC1 isoform, devoid of any cleavable pre-sequence, is targeted to the mitochondria, where it is efficiently inserted into the outer membrane (19Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The presence of VDAC1 in the plasma membrane leads to the question of its role there. In this report we establish that VDAC1 at the level of the plasma membrane can function as a redox enzyme, capable of reducing extracellular ferricyanide in the presence of intracellular NADH. Cell Culture—Namalwa cells were cultured as previously described (2Larm J.A. Vaillant F. Linnane A.W. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30097-30100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS7 cells were detached by pretreating with cell dissociation solution (Sigma, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia) and incubated for 5 min prior to gentle agitation of the flasks. Cell concentrations were determined as previously described (2Larm J.A. Vaillant F. Linnane A.W. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30097-30100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Plasma Membrane-enriched Fractions from Namalwa Cells—Unless indicated otherwise, all steps were performed at 4 °C. Approximately 6-8 × 108 cells were pelleted and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Following the second wash, the supernatant was removed and the cells were adjusted to 2 × 108 cells/ml using ice cold lysis buffer consisting of 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EGTA. Digitonin (1.4 mg/109 cells) was added, and the cells were lysed on ice using 72 strokes in a glass homogenizer (Sigma). After lysis, the homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and kept at -20 °C for later analysis. The pellet was washed twice with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then resuspended in buffer A adjusted to 4 × 108 cells/ml. The resuspended pellet was then loaded onto a two-phase system. The two-phase system contained 6.4% (w/w) dextran T-500, 6.4% (w/w) poly(ethylene glycol) 3350, and 0.1 m sucrose. The homogenate (2 g) was added to the two-phase system, and the weight of the system was brought to 16 g with distilled water. The tubes were inverted vigorously 40 times in the cold (4 °C). The phases were separated by centrifugation at 150 × g in an IEC Centra-7R refrigerated centrifuge. The upper phase was carefully withdrawn, together with the interface, and transferred into 10-ml centrifuge tubes. The sample was then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min. The fluffy pellet resulting from the spin constituted the plasma membrane-enriched fraction. Purity of plasma membrane preparations was determined by subcellular marker enzyme assays (Refs. 2Larm J.A. Vaillant F. Linnane A.W. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30097-30100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 24Vaillant F. Larm J.A. McMullen G.L. Wolvetang E.J. Lawen A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; see following section). Alternatively, after the second wash the cells were resuspended in ice-cold 1 mm NaHCO3, 0.2 mm EDTA (dipotassium salt) at an approximate ratio of 1 ml/108 cells to osmotically swell the cells (25Morré D.M. Morré D.J. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2000; 743: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The resulting cell suspension was then incubated at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 40 min in a 10-ml disposable centrifuge tube. Following incubation, cells were mechanically disrupted using 110 strokes in a 7-ml all-glass Kontes Dounce homogenizer (Sigma). The extent of cell rupture was monitored by light microscopy and trypan blue exclusion, and was found to be consistently ≥85%. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min in Sorvall Evolution centrifuge (SS34 rotor) for 10 min, 4 °C, to remove nuclei and unruptured cells. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min as above at 4 °C. The supernatant was extracted with a plastic transfer pipette and stored at 4 °C for later analysis, whereas the pellet was thoroughly resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A), to a net mass of 8 g. This concentrated suspension was divided into four 2-g aliquots, each of which was then individually loaded onto one of four 16-g aqueous two-phase systems constructed on a weight basis. Each system had a final composition of 6.6% poly(ethylene glycol) 3350 (Sigma) + 6.6% Dextran-500 (Sigma) + 1.9 g of 1 m sucrose solution + 0.4 g of 200 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.4) + 2 g of resuspended membranes in buffer A. In each case the total mass of the system was brought to 16 g with distilled Milli-Q H2O. Each two-phase system was constructed in 15-ml glass Corex centrifuge tubes, sealed with Parafilm, and mixed vigorously with at least 70 inversions at 4 °C. Following the separation of the phases by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min as above at 4 °C, the upper phase of each system was extracted (taking care not to disturb the material collected at the interface) and repartitioned against a fresh lower phase of a second set of two-phase systems constructed in parallel, except containing 2 g of buffer A in place of the crude membrane suspension. The material from the second set of upper phases was collected, diluted 1:5 in buffer A, pelleted at 25,000 × g for 30 min (as above) at 4 °C, and then resuspended in fresh buffer A. All preparations used were highly enriched in plasma membranes and showed minimal mitochondrial contaminations (Table I).Table IEnrichment of plasma membranes by two-phase separationEnzyme (organelle)Crude extractSpecific activityAfter two-phase separationSpecific activityEnrichment factorμkatnkat/mgμkatnkat/mgSuccinate dehydrogenase (mitochondria)44.61557.6 ± 46.11.21121.2 ± 18.20.22Alkaline phosphatase (plasma membrane)11.64145.5 ± 26.54.16415.8 ± 36.42.86Succinate dehydrogenase: alkaline phosphatase ratio1.000.08 Open table in a new tab Enzyme Assays—All enzyme assays and subcellular enzyme markers have been used as described elsewhere (24Vaillant F. Larm J.A. McMullen G.L. Wolvetang E.J. Lawen A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Alkaline phosphatase was assayed for as the plasma membrane marker, using an adaptation of a previously described method (26Pekarthy J.M. Short J. Lansing A.I. Lieberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of protein were added to 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 10.5, 2 mm MgCl2. The reaction was started with the addition of 4 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate. The increase in absorbance at 420 nm was measured at 37 °C for 1 h. Rates of activity are expressed in nanokatals/mg of protein using the extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenol in alkaline solution of 9620 m-1 cm-1. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was determined via the spectrophotometric measurement of the initial linear rates of the reduction of the artificial electron acceptor, dichlorophenolindophenol, at 600 nm (decrease in absorbance) in the presence of succinate. Each 1 ml of reaction medium contained 50 mm dipotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 40 μm dichlorophenolindophenol, and with the reaction being started by the addition of 20 mm sodium succinate. Rates of activity are expressed in nanokatals/mg of protein using the extinction coefficient of dichlorophenolindophenol at physiological pH of 5500 m-1 cm-1. NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity was measured in a Beckman DU 7500 spectrophotometer. Reduction of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide was ascertained in 1-ml reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 750 μl of fraction, 250 μm β-NADH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 250 μm potassium ferricyanide, following a 5-min pre-incubation period at 37 °C. Rates were measured at either 420 or 340 nm at 37 °C for 500 s, with the linear rate of decrease in absorbance being determined from the second 250-s duration. Actual rates of enzymic activity were determined using an extinction coefficient for ferricyanide (420 nm) of 1000 m-1 cm-1 or 6220 m-1 cm-1 for NADH (340 nm). Determination of Protein Concentrations—Protein concentrations were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid assay (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18501) Google Scholar). Purification of the NADH-Ferricyanide Reductase—The chromatographic steps of DEAE-Sephacel and Blue Sepharose affinity column were carried out using stepwise gradient elution, respectively. Solubilized proteins from the enriched plasma membrane pellet were applied to the DEAE-Sephacel column (5-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A + 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100). The column was washed three times with 20 ml of buffer B. The material bound onto the column was eluted by 10 ml of buffer B containing 50 mm NaCl. Active fractions eluting from the column were pooled and applied to the Blue Sepharose affinity column (5-ml bed volume), which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed twice with 10 ml of buffer B, then eluted with a linear 10-ml gradient (0-10 μm) of NADH in buffer B. One-ml fractions were collected and assayed for NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity. Solubilization of Plasma Membrane Proteins—The plasma membrane-enriched fraction was centrifuged at 25,000 × g as above for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting creamy white pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3% (v/v) Triton-X-100 to an approximate concentration of 5 mg/ml and stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. The solubilized fraction was obtained by pelleting the insoluble material at 100,000 × g for 40 min in a Beckman TLX optima ultracentrifuge (TLA-100.3 rotor) at 4 °C. Purification of VDAC1—VDAC1 was purified according to Ref. 28De Pinto V. Prezioso G. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar with a slight modification from either Namalwa cell plasma membrane or rat liver mitochondria preparations. For the preparation of mitochondria, Wistar rats were decapitated, and their livers excised and immediately washed twice in lysis buffer. Following the second wash, the livers were diced into 2-mm3 pieces and diluted 1:3 (w/w) with ice-cold lysis buffer (as outlined for Namalwa cells). The diced livers were then homogenized in a 50-ml glass Teflon homogenizer (Sigma) at 1500 rpm, for five strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was decanted, and a second centrifugation was performed at 600 × g for 5 min to remove any contaminating nuclei. Following the second spin, the supernatant was carefully aspirated so as not to disturb the pellet. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the mitochondria. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer 2 (225 mm mannitol, 25 mm sucrose, 2 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA). A second centrifugation was performed at 30,000 × g for 30 min to wash the mitochondria. Following the second spin, the mitochondrial pellet was taken and diluted to 5 mg/ml in buffer A. After incubating in buffer A for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min and the pellet, consisting mainly of mitochondrial membranes, was used further. The membranes were then solubilized in buffer A + 5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Following constant stirring for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was taken. The supernatant was then applied onto a DEAE column, which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The flow through was taken and applied to a dry 2:1 (w/w) hydroxylapatite:celite (HTP:celite) column. The flow through from the HTP:celite column was collected, which consisted of purified VDAC1. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)—SDS-PAGE and silver staining were performed as described elsewhere (29Nesterenko M.V. Tilley M. Upton S.J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1994; 28: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 30Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Following transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, the membrane was blocked in 5% (w/v) skim milk powder (Bio-Rad, Regents Park, New South Wales, Australia) in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following three washes with washing buffer (0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in TBS) for 20 min, the membrane was hybridized overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody at 1/1000 dilution. The membrane was then washed three times with TBS and incubated with a dilution of 1/1250 horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia), for 1 h at 37 °C. Following three washes, ECL was used as previously described (31Grubb D.R. Ly J.D. Vaillant F. Johnson K.L. Lawen A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4085-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Approximately 1-2 μg of rabbit anti-porin IgG antibody was added to the 10-ml purified fraction and allowed to agitate at 4 °C overnight. Following this, 50 μl of a 50% protein G bead slurry was added and the mixture was agitated for another 2 h. The sample was spun at 10,000 × g for 15 s, and the supernatant containing the unbound material was removed and kept for later analyses. The protein G-antibody-antigen complex was further washed three times with buffer A + 0.5 m NaCl and once with buffer B. The immunopellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B. Precipitation of Protein from Detergents—Proteins were precipitated according to the method of Wessel and Flügge (32Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar). FACS Analysis—Approximately 1 × 107 cells were harvested, pelleted (800 × g, 5 min) and washed twice in 1% fetal calf serum in PBS. The cells were suspended in 4 ml of PBS and incubated for 40 min with goat anti-mouse IgG Fc fragment (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). The cells were then washed and divided equally into four tubes. Tubes 2 and 4 were incubated for 40 min at 4 °C with anti-VDAC1 antibody at 1/1000 dilution. The cells were pelleted (800 × g, 5 min) and the supernatant aspirated. The pellet was then washed twice with 1% fetal calf serum in PBS. Following the second wash, tubes 3 and 4 were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 40 min. FITC histograms were obtained by analyzing 15,000 cells with the MODfit program (Becton-Dickinson, Wheelers Hill, Victoria, Australia). The amount of viable cells was simultaneously obtained by staining intracellular DNA with propidium iodide, and the fluorescence was measured using the same program. Growth and Maintenance of Escherichia coli—Transformed E. coli bearing the recombinant plasmids were grown in liquid Luria Broth supplemented with kanamycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight for growth. DNA Plasmid Amplification—pl-VDAC1-GFP was a kind gift from Prof. Dermietzel (19Buettner R. Papoutsoglou G. Scemes E. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3201-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 μg of DNA was taken and used to inoculate 107 viable E. coli cells. The cells were grown on solid Luria Broth medium with kanamycin to select for transformed cells. Plasmid DNA was purified according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Clontech, East Meadow Circle, PA). As a control, the commercially available pEGFP vector was used (Clontech). Electroporation of COS7 Cells—Cells to be electroporated were grown logarithmically (70% confluent). Each transfection required 2 × 106 cells to yield a reasonable number of transfectants. One ml of trypsin was added for 5 min per 10-cm culture dish, and the cells were collected and harvested by centrifuging for 5 min at 1200 rpm and then resuspending in 400 ml of ice-cold medium and placed in a 0.8-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad). The cells were then electroporated at 200 V in a Gene-Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad) with the capacitor set at 960 microfarads. The time constants obtained ranged from 15 to 45 ms. The cells were then transferred to growth medium and allowed to grow for 48 h. Purification of a Plasma Membrane NADH-Ferricyanide Reductase—Human Namalwa cells were harvested and washed, and the plasma membrane extracted to a purity of >90% as described under “Materials and Methods.” Triton X-100 (3% (v/v)) was the best detergent for solubilizing maximal enzyme activity (data not shown). To further purify the enzyme, the solubilized membrane proteins were applied onto a DEAE-Sephacel column. Active enzyme was eluted with 50-100 mm NaCl (data not shown). Those fractions with NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity eluting from the DEAE-Sephacel column were pooled and applied to a Blue Sepharose, a 2′,5′-ADP affinity, or an HTP:celite (1:2) column. Following washing with 5 column volumes, elution of the enzyme from the former two columns was achieved with a 10-ml gradient of 0-50 μm NADH. One-ml fractions were collected and assayed for enzyme activity. Those fractions with NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity were then precipitated and run in an SDS-PAGE. A 35-kDa band correlated with enzyme activity, suggesting it might be the NADH-ferricyanide reductase (data not shown). Both purification protocols yielded more than 200-fold enrichment from the plasma membrane enriched fractions of the enzyme activity (Table II) and the purification of a major protein band of ∼35 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B).Table IIPurification of a plasma membrane NADH-ferricyanide reductaseStepProteinVolumeEnzyme activitySpecific activityPurification factormgmlfkatfkat/mgPlasma membrane252527751111Solubilization10252775277.52.5DEAE0.163364.52278.120.6a.

Four resulting peptides with their predicted amino acid sequences were used to search the BLAST and TREMBL data bases for sequence homology to known proteins. This search revealed the 35-kDa band to be identical to human VDAC1 (Fig. 1C). VDAC1 Is an NADH-Ferricyanide Reductase—Co-elution of VDAC1 with enzyme activity from various columns suggested that VDAC1 is an NADH-ferricyanide reductase. However, because the eluants were not homogeneous, further evidence was sought to confirm the function of VDAC1 as a re"
https://openalex.org/W2042298557,"An important role for JNK* and p38 has recently been discovered in the differentiating effect of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) on osteoblastic cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which BMP-2 activates JNK and p38 in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Activation of JNK and p38 induced by BMP-2 was blocked by the protein kinase C/protein kinase D (PKC/PKD) inhibitor Go6976 but not by the related compound, Go6983, a selective inhibitor of conventional PKCs. Associated with this inhibitory effect of Go6976, BMP-2 induced a selective and a dose-dependent Ser916 phosphorylation/activation of PKD, which was also blocked by Go6976. In contrast to the recently described PKC-dependent molecular mechanism involved in activation of PKD by G protein-coupled receptor agonists, BMP-2 did not induce a phosphorylation of PKD on Ser744/748. To further document an implication of PKD in activation of JNK and p38 induced by BMP-2, we constructed MC3T3-E1 cells stably expressing PKD antisense oligonucleotide (AS-PKD). In AS-PKD clones having low PKD levels, activation of JNK and p38 by BMP-2, but not of Smad1/5, was markedly impaired compared with empty vector transfected (V-PKD) cells. Analysis of osteoblastic cell differentiation in AS-PKD compared with V-PKD cells showed that mRNA and protein expressions of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin induced by BMP-2 were markedly reduced in AS-PKD. In conclusion, results presented in this study indicate that BMP-2 can induce activation of PKD in osteoblastic cells by a PKC-independent mechanism and that this kinase is involved in activation of JNK and p38 induced by BMP-2. Thus, this pathway, in addition to Smads, appears to be essential for the effect of BMP-2 on osteoblastic cell differentiation.

In particular, they contribute to the formation of bone and connective tissues (1.Schmitt J.M. Hwang K. Winn S.R. Hollinger J.O. J. Orthopaed. Res. 1999; 17: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) by inducing the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into bone-forming cells (2.Yamaguchi A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). BMP-2 expression has been observed in a large variety of cells including osteoblasts (3.Iwasaki S. Tsuruoka N. Hattori A. Sato M. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5476-5482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This factor is one of the most potent stimulators of osteoblastic cell differentiation, which is mainly characterized by expression of ALP, type I collagen, and Oc (4.Hughes F.J. Collyer J. Stanfield M. Goodman S.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2671-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 5.Gazzerro E. Gangji V. Canalis E. J. Clin.

Biochem. 1999; 72: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Members of the TGF-β superfamily exert their biological activities by binding to cell surface type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors. The type II receptor phosphorylates type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates and activates intracellular substrates such as proteins of the Smad family. Smad 1 (7.Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and the closely related Smads 5 and 8, specifically mediate BMP-2 responses, such as for example, the osteoblastic differentiation of precursor cell lines (8.Yamamoto N. Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Namiki M. Kurokawa T. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 9.Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, Smad 1/5/8 proteins interact with a common partner, Smad 4, and the complex Smad 1/5/8-Smad 4 translocates to the nucleus where it exerts transcriptional activity either through direct binding to DNA or via association with other DNA-binding proteins (10.Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). Among signal transducers recently reported to participate in TGF-β signaling, the MAPKs probably play a significant role in cooperating with Smads. MAPKs are a group of well described serine/threonine kinases implicated in the transmission of extracellular signals to intracellular targets (11.Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Cooperative interaction between Smads and transcription factors activated by MAPKs has been recently described for TGF-β signaling. Several TGF-β-responsive elements containing AP1 binding sites are activated by c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers (12.Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that TGFβ and Smad 3 only weakly induce AP1-containing promoters in absence of c-Jun or c-Fos binding suggesting that Smads require active c-Jun/c-Fos dimers as DNA binding partners (13.Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Smads were found to preferentially interact with the phosphorylated form of c-Jun (13.Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), which is generated by the activity of JNK. As for c-Jun/c-Fos, Smads can also cooperate with activated ATF2, which is generated upon phosphorylation by p38 MAPK (14.Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In relation with these recent observations, we recently found that JNK and p38 are activated by BMP-2 and documented their implication in the differentiating effect of this bone morphogenetic protein in MC3T3-E1 and primary calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells (15.Guicheux J. Lemonnier J. Suzuki A. Palmer G. Caverzasio J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 2060-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which BMP-2 induces activation of JNK and p38 remains completely unknown. Recent studies indicated that BMP-2 can either activate the PI3 kinase Akt pathway in 2T3 cells (16.Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud S.L. Nishimura R. Celeste A. Mahimainathan L. Choudhury G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) or PKC pathways in human neonatal calvaria cells (17.Hay E. Lemonnier J. Fromigue O. Marie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29028-29036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The protein kinases C (PKCs) comprise a family of intracellular serine/threonine specific kinases, that are implicated in signal transduction of a wide range of biological responses, including changes in cell morphology, proliferation and differentiation (18.Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 19.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 20.Toker A. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 13 members of the family can be grouped into three major classes of Ca2+-dependent classical PKCs (cPKCs), Ca2+-independent, novel PKCs (nPKCs), and Ca2+- and lipid-independent atypical PKCs (aPKC). The fourth PKC subgroup, which consists of PKCμ (21.Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its mouse homologue protein kinase D1 (PKD) (22.Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), PKCν (23.Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and PKD2 (24.Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), share common structures such as N-terminal cysteine fingers defining the structural basis for lipid-mediated activation. They differ from the three major groups of PKC isozymes by the presence of an acidic domain (25.Gschwendt M. Johannes F.J. Kittstein W. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20742-20746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a PH domain and the lack of a typical pseudosubstrate site. PKD is ubiquitously expressed and involved in diverse cellular functions (26.Lint J.V. Rykx A. Vantus T. Vandenheede J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27.Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), such as constitutive transport processes in epithelial cells (29.Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), G protein-mediated regulation of Golgi organization (30.Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and protection from apoptosis (31.Johannes F.J. Horn J. Link G. Haas E. Siemienski K. Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Given the important role of the stress kinases JNK and p38 in BMP-2-induced osteoblastic cell differentiation (15.Guicheux J. Lemonnier J. Suzuki A. Palmer G. Caverzasio J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 2060-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism involved in the activation of these MAP kinases and studied the role of PKCs in mediating this signaling process. We found that activation of PKD by a PKC-independent mechanism is involved in activation of these stress MAP kinases by BMP-2 in MC3T3-E1 cells. Using antisense oligonucleotide technique, we also provide compelling evidences that this signaling pathway is required for osteoblastic cell differentiation. Reagents, Antibodies, and Plasmids—FCS, glutamine, antibiotics, and trypsin/EDTA were obtained from Invitrogen. α-MEM was purchased from Amimed (Bioconcept, Allschwill, Switzerland) and PMA from Sigma (Sigma Chemical Co.). GST-c-Jun and GST-c-ATF2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Go6976 and Go6983 were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Polyclonal anti-JNK, anti-p38, anti-PKCμ/PKD (C terminus of mouse origin), and anti-p-c-Jun were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-Smad 1/5 and anti-pPKCϵ were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal anti-pp38, anti-pPKD/PKCμ(Ser916), anti-pPKD/PKCμ(Ser744/748), pSmad 1/5, anti-pMEK4, anti-pMEK3,6, anti-pPan-PKC, anti-pPKCξ/λ, anti-PKCδ, and the monoclonal anti-pJNK were obtained from New England BioLabs (Cell Signaling Technology, MA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse calvaria-derived MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), 0.5% nonessential amino acids (v/v), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In experiments aimed at testing the effect of BMP-2, cells were switched to 2% fetal calf serum 24 h before and during the study. When the influence of PKC inhibitors was investigated, agents were added 1 h prior to and during the experiments. For the construction of PKD antisense (AS-PKD) plasmid, an oligonucleotide of 70 bases, targeted against sequences adjacent to the ATG initiation codon of PKD (PKCμ) mRNA, was synthesized with BamHI and EcoRI sites in 5′ and 3′, respectively (MWG Biotech, Germany). The oligonucleotide sequence was 5′-GGGCT AGGCGGTCGCAGCAGCGGAGGGACGCTCATCCCGCCAGTGAGCCCCAAAGTTTGGCGGACGTGGG-3′. This oligonucleotide and its complementary strand were annealed and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing cytomegalovirus promoter and neomycin resistance gene. MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with either the AS-PKD or empty vector using Superfect. Transfected cells were selected with G418 sulfate (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA) at 0.8, 0.4, 0.2 mg/ml during the first, second, and third week, respectively, following plasmids transfection. Selected cell lines were then cultured in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml G418 sulfate. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—MC3T3-E1 cells treated with different agents were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until used for analysis. Cells were lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.01 μm calyculin A, 0.1 μm mycrocystin LR, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS for 10 min. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 30 min. and subsequently immunoprecipitated with 2–3 μg/ml antibodies for 18 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads 20–30 μl were then added in each tube during the last hour of incubation. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, suspended in SDS sample buffer and heated at 70 °C for 30 min and subjected to gel electrophoresis on 6–15% gels. Following SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes and immunoblotted as previously described (32.Caverzasio J. Palmer G. Suzuki A. Bonjour J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Detection was performed using peroxidase-coupled secondary, enhanced chemiluminescence reaction and visualization by autoradiography (Amersham Biosciences). Filters that were reprobed with different antibodies were stripped according to the manufacturer's protocol. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with a kinase reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol and incubated with 10 μm32P-ATP (50 μCi/ml) either alone for 30 min at 30 °C for PKD autophosphorylation or with appropriate GST-MAPK substrate during 60 min for MAPK assays. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2× reducing buffer, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of [32P]phosphate was visualized by autoradiography. Biochemical Analysis of Markers of Bone Cell Differentiation—Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates for 7 days before BMP-2 exposure. ALP activity was assessed as previously reported (33.Suzuki A. Palmer G. Bonjour J.P. Caverzasio J. Bone. 1998; 23: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a chromogenic substrate. The release of Oc in the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay using a goat anti-mouse osteocalcin antibody and a donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA). Protein contents were determined using the Pierce Coomassie Plus assay reagent (Pierce). RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting Analysis—Total cellular RNA was extracted using the Tripure reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Equal amounts (10 μg) of RNA were electrophoretically resolved on an 1.5% agarose gel in phosphate buffer and transferred onto GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane (DuPont de Nemours, Brussels, Belgium) by overnight capillary transfer. Membranes were prehybridized at 68 °C for 2 h in Quickhyb (Stratagene) complemented with 5 μg/ml ssDNA before hybridization at 68 °C for 3 h with the desired cDNA probe labeled with 50 μCi of deoxy-[α-32P]CTP by random priming (Megaprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Biosciences). The filters were finally exposed for autoradiography at –80 °C. A 2.5-kb EcoRI restriction fragment corresponding to the rat ALP cDNA (34.Thiede M.A. Yoon K. Golub E.E. Noda M. Rodan G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was providing by Dr. Rodan (Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories, Westpoint). The mouse osteocalcin cDNA probe was obtained by RT-PCR using specific primers as previously described (35.Ikegame M. Ishibashi O. Yoshizawa T. Shimomura J. Komori T. Ozawa H. Kawashima H. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR product was then purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen II, Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). The amount of cyclophilin transcript detected in the same conditions was assessed using a cDNA probe for human cyclophilin (36.Haendler B. Hofer-Warbinek R. Hofer E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All experiments were carried out independently at least three times. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Comparative studies of means were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc test (projected least significant difference Fisher) with a significance value of p < 0.05. We recently found that BMP-2 can induce a stimulation of JNK and p38 in MC3T3-E1 and primary calvaria-derived osteoblastic cells (15.Guicheux J. Lemonnier J. Suzuki A. Palmer G. Caverzasio J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 2060-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Expression of this newly described BMP-2-induced signaling pathway was found to be delayed compared with activation of Smads and the underlying molecular mechanism of activation remained to be investigated. Among functional signaling pathways recently described to mediate BMP-2 effects in osteoblastic cells, PKCs have been reported to be involved in BMP-2-induced apoptosis in human neonatal calvaria cells (17.Hay E.

To study the possible implication of a PKC in BMP-2-induced activation of stress MAP kinases JNK and p38, we used two staurosporine-derived selective PKC inhibitors, Go6983 and Go6976, that have different PKC inhibitory specificities. The former inhibits the activity of PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCδ, and pKCγ whereas the latter blunts PKCα and PKCβI as well as PKCμ/PKD activities (37.Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.J. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, Go6983 had no effect on stress MAP kinases activation induced by BMP-2 whereas Go6976 completely blunted this response. Since the main difference between the two compounds for inhibiting PKCs is PKCμ/PKD, this observation suggested that this kinase might be involved in BMP-2-induced activation of JNK and p38. To investigate whether PKD is involved in this signaling response, we first analyzed whether BMP-2 can activate PKD in MC3T3-E1 cells. Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing a C-terminal epitope, PKD appeared as a doubled protein band (∼110 and 115 kDa) on Western blots (Fig. 2). Whether these two bands correspond to different members of the PKD family or of two different sizes of one member is not clear at the moment. Of interest and as further discussed below, we found that BMP-2 mainly induced an increase in Ser916 phosphorylation of the higher molecular size of this doubled protein band and this effect was blunted by Go6976 but not by Go6983 and was still detectable in cells preincubated for 18 h with 1 μm PMA to down regulate DAG-sensitive PKCs (Fig. 2). Associated with this effect of BMP-2 on Ser916 PKD phosphorylation, which was previously reported to modify the conformation of the kinase and to influence the duration of its kinase activity (38.Vertommen D.R.M. Ni Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19567-19576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we did not find any change in activation of either conventional PKCs or of PKCϵ and PKCλ (Fig. 2), two novel PKCs recently shown to preferentially activate PKD (39.Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, this series of observations indicate that BMP-2 can activate PKD in osteoblast-like cells but the implication of a PKC in this activation remains unclear. To further document that BMP-2 can activate PKD and that this kinase is involved in activation of JNK and p38, we analyzed the relationship between changes in PKD activity (in vitro kinase assay) and of JNK and p38 in cells treated with various doses of BMP-2 (Fig. 3A). We also studied the dose inhibitory effects of Go6976 on changes in PKD Ser916 phosphorylation and of JNK activity induced by BMP-2 (Fig. 3B). Both analysis revealed a close relationship between activation of PKD induced by BMP-2 and the stimulation of stress MAP kinases JNK and p38, further suggesting an implication of PKD in this signaling response. A time course analysis of PKD and JNK activation induced by BMP-2 was also performed and data are shown in Fig. 4. Clearly, changes in Ser916 phosphorylation of PKD induced by BMP-2 preceded by about 1 h the stimulation of c-Jun phosphorylation that correlates with activation of JNK in MC3T3-E1 cells (15.Guicheux J. Lemonnier J. Suzuki A. Palmer G. Caverzasio J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 2060-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In this series of experiments, we also analyzed whether BMP-2 induces a change in PKC-mediated PKD Ser744/748 phosphorylation as recently reported in response to GPCR agonists in fibroblasts and epithelial cells (39.Waldron R.T.

Confluent MC3T3-E1 cells were preincubated with 10 μm of either Go6976 or Go6983 or their vehicle for 1 h or with 1 μm PMA for 18 h and then exposed to BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) for 3 h before lysis at 4 °C.

The sequence of this oligonucleotide is described under “Experimental Procedures” and was targeted against the first ATG start codon of mouse PKD1 mRNA transcript. Expression of PKD was monitored in several clones and two of them (AS1-PKD and AS2-PKD) having selectively lost expression of the upper PKD protein band (Fig. 5A) were selected for further analysis. Clearly, the absence of this PKD protein band, which corresponds to the band in which we detected a change in the phosphorylation of PKD on Ser916 in response to BMP-2, was associated with a nearly complete loss of JNK and p38 activation induced by BMP-2 compared with a normal response in empty vector stably transfected cells (Fig. 5B). As expected, associated with the absence of this PKD molecule, basal and stimulated PKD activity as well as increase in Ser916 PKD induced by BMP-2 were markedly decreased (Fig. 6A). Of interest, activation of Smad1/5 by BMP-2 was practically normal in these AS-PKD clones (Fig. 6A and similar results for AS2 not shown) indicating that this effect is not related to impairment in BMP-2 receptor expression and/or activity.Fig. 6Selective inhibition of PKD and of J"

They localize to junctional complexes between endothelial and epithelial cells and seem to participate in cell-cell adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes. Here, we report the identification of a new member of the CTX family. This protein, which was designated CLMP (coxsackie- and adenovirus receptor-like membrane protein), is composed of 373 amino acids including an extracellular part containing a V- and a C2-type domain, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail. CLMP mRNA was detected in a variety of both human and mouse tissues and cell lines. The protein migrated with an Mr of around 48 on SDS-PAGE and was predominantly expressed in epithelial cells within different tissues. In cultured epithelial cells, CLMP was detected in areas of cell-cell contacts. When exogenously expressed in polarized MDCK cells, CLMP was restricted to the subapical area of the lateral cell surface, where it co-localized with the tight junction markers ZO-1 and occludin. Also endogenous CLMP showed association with tight junctions, as analyzed in polarized human CACO-2 cells. This suggested a role for CLMP in cell-cell adhesion and indeed, overexpressed CLMP induced aggregation of non-polarized CHO cells. Furthermore, CLMP-expressing MDCK cells showed significantly increased transepithelial resistance, indicating a role for CLMP in junctional barrier function. Thus, we conclude that CLMP is a novel cell-cell adhesion molecule and a new component of epithelial tight junctions. We also suggest, based on phylogenetic studies, that CLMP, CAR, ESAM, and BT-IgSF form a new group of proteins within the CTX family.

(cortical thymocyte marker in Xenopus) was originally discovered as a developmentally regulated type-I transmembrane protein specifically expressed by a large fraction of cortical thymocytes in Xenopuslaevis (1.Chretien I.

It is structurally organized in an extracellular part containing one variable (V-type) and one constant (C2-type) immunoglobulin domain (separated from each other by a J segment), a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail. Being the first identified member, CTX has been regarded as the prototype of a new subclass of proteins belonging to the large immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) of transmembrane proteins (1.Chretien I.

Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 327-334PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), in which JAM-1-3 have been replaced by JAM-A-C, respectively. Other recently identified members are the endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) (16.Hirata K. Ishida T. Penta K. Rezaee M. Yang E. Wohlgemuth J. Quertermous T. J. Biol.

These genes/proteins share characteristics with CTX such as a specific exon/intron organization, in which both the V and the C2 domains are encoded by splicing of two half-domain exons, and an extra pair of cysteine residues flanking the C2 domain. These characteristics have therefore been regarded as hallmarks of the CTX family (2.Chretien I. Marcuz A. Courtet M. Katevuo K. Vainio O. Heath J.K. White S.J. Du Pasquier L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4094-4104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only exception to this basic structure is JAM-A, which lacks the extra pair of cysteine residues. The CTX-like proteins are localized to cell-cell contacts between epithelial and endothelial cells within various tissues of the body. Among the specific members, A33 is exclusively expressed in epithelial cells within the gastrointestinal tract (6.Heath J.K. White S.J. Johnstone C.N. Catimel B. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Tu G.F.

The JAMs, having attracted much attention because of their possible role in transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelial barrier to sites of inflammation, are localized to the cell surface of endothelial and epithelial cells, but have also been detected on circulating blood cells (14.Aurrand-Lions M. Johnson-Leger C. Wong C. Du Pasquier L. Imhof B.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The extracellular part of JAM-A interacts with other JAM-A molecules in a homophilic manner (25.Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Mueller F. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Bartfai T. Dejana E. Brockhaus M. J.

Recently, JAM-C was also found to be a counterreceptor for the leukocyte β2-integrin Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18) (15.Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), an interaction that has been suggested to play a critical role for platelet-leukocyte interactions. TJs are the most apical junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells, appearing on electron micrographs as a series of electron dense, tight contact points between the plasma membranes of adjacent cells (28.Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). They function as barriers that prevent solutes, ions and water from passing freely through the paracellular pathway, and represent an anatomical fence at which polarized cells show a characteristic separation of their plasma membranes into apical and basolateral regions (29.Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 30.Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). TJs consist of transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins. The major transmembrane protein is claudin, which spans the membrane four times and is essential for the formation of the TJ. More than 20 claudin isoforms have been identified, each one generally expressed in only a restricted number of cell types (30.Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). Occludin, the second type of tetraspanning membrane protein of the TJ (31.Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar), does not seem to be an essential component of these complexes because the TJs in occludin -/- mice are not affected morphologically, and the barrier function of intestinal epithelium is normal (32.Saitou M. Furuse M. Sasaki H. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4131-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The CTX-like proteins, CAR and JAM, represent a newly discovered family of type I transmembrane proteins that also sublocalize to endothelial and epithelial TJs. These proteins are single spanning membrane Ig-like adhesion molecules, which mediate homophilic adhesion (25.Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Mueller F. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Bartfai T. Dejana E.

In this study, we present the identification and characterization of CLMP (CAR-like membrane protein), an additional member of the CTX family. We show that CLMP, is expressed in epithelial cells within different tissues, co-localizes with the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin in polarized MDCK cells, can mediate cell aggregation, and can regulate transepithelial resistance across polarized epithelial cells, supporting the notion that CLMP is involved in epithelial cell-cell adhesion. Bioinformatics—Multiple sequence alignments of the CTX-like proteins were performed using the ClustalW algorithm and the Blossum 62 substitution matrix (BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor). The most conserved regions within the J segment and the C2 domain were used as search strings to identify novel related genes in the nonredundant and EST databases in the NCBI and the Celera human and mouse databases using the TBLASTN program. This resulted in the identification of a human “full insert sequence” (fis) clone termed HRC08561. This clone was originally isolated from primary human renal epithelial cells as part of the NEDO human cDNA sequencing project and filed in Genbank (NCBI) as a full-length cDNA sequence with the accession number AK026068, potentially encoding an unnamed protein product of 373 amino acids (accession number BAB15347). By searching the fully assembled mouse genomic Celera data base with the TBLASTX program with the BAB15347 amino acid sequence as a query, a genomic sequence potentially encoding a mouse orthologue to human BAB15347 was identified. Phylogenetic relationships were examined by distance matrix analysis and a tree was constructed in the TreeView program. cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—The human fis HRC08561 clone was kindly provided by Dr. Hiroko Hata at the Department of Virology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo. Standard PCR technique using primers: 5′-CACCATGTCCCTCCTCCTTCTC-3′, 5′-TCAGACCGTTTGGAAGGC-3′ (the translation initiation and termination signals are underlined) and a DNA polymerase with 5′ → 3′ proofreading activity (PFU DNA Polymerase, Promega, Madison, WI) was used to amplify the coding region of the cDNA. The amplified sequence was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen AB, Stockholm, Sweden) by standard TOPO-cloning procedures. The coding part of the mouse cDNA sequence was isolated from a mouse 17-day embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by standard PCR technique, using the two primers: 5′-CACCATGTCCCTCTTCTTCCTC-3′ and 5′-TCAGACAGTTTGGAAGGC-3′. The amplified region was, similarly to the coding part of the human cDNA, cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO. DNA sequencing was performed using the Thermo Sequenase dye terminator cycle sequencing pre-mix kit (Amersham Biosciences) and an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer, PerkinElmer, Stockholm, Sweden) as described by the manufacturer. Cell Lines and Transfection—HEK293 (293), CACO-2, BEAS-2B, MDCK, and CHO cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The human glioma cell line T98G was originally established from a patient tumor classified as glioblastoma multiforme, malignancy grade IV (34.Collins V.P. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1983; 24: 135-202PubMed Google Scholar). All cells except CHO and MDCK cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). CHO and MDCK cells were cultured in EMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed with the LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) according to conditions that were recommended by the manufacturer. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot hybridization was performed on human or mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (MTN, Clontech) with probes corresponding to a 446-nucleotide PCR fragment of the human CLMP cDNA or to a 487-nucleotide PCR fragment of the mouse CLMP cDNA, respectively. The cDNA probes were generated and labeled by PCR-amplification (human primers: 5′-ACAGGCATAGTGGCTGGA-3′, 5′-GACTCCTAGGAAAGCGTG-3′; mouse primers: 5′-GACAGGCATAGTGGCAGGA-3′, 5′-GCAAGCACAAGTCAAGTC-3′) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization and washing steps were performed under conditions that were recommended by the manufacturer and blots were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, which was developed using a Fujifilm Bio-Image Analyzer BAS1500 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). A human β-actin probe was obtained from the manufacturer and was used under standard conditions. Antibodies—Two peptides, corresponding to 18 amino acids (N-GTHTEIKRVAEEKVTLPC-C) in the N-terminal part (NP1) or to 18 amino acids (N-CAETTPSMIPSQSRAFQTV-C) of the very C-terminal part (CP1) of human CLMP were synthesized (an extra cysteine residue that was added to the N-terminal part of the CP1 peptide is underlined). The peptides were coupled to Imject Maleimide-activated mcKLH carrier (Pierce) via the cysteine residues. Rabbits were immunized with 500 μg of peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant (Invitrogen) and boosted with 500 μg of peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Invitrogen) every 4 weeks. The antiserum was affinity-purified against the peptide used for immunization using the SulfoLink Kit (Pierce) and quantified by a spectrophotometer at 280 nm. The mouse monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin (clone 36) and occludin (clone 19) were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Stockholm, Sweden). The mouse monoclonal antibody against ZO-1 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories. The polyclonal rabbit antibody against calnexin was produced in the laboratory. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared by solubilization in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 KIE/ml Trasylol (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany), and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and equal amounts of protein were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Germany). Membranes were incubated with the rabbit NP1 or CP1 antibodies, washed, and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Amersham Biosciences). HRP activity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells to be analyzed by regular immunofluorescence microscopy were seeded on coverslips, grown until confluence and at the time for staining, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, quenched with 10 mm glycin in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature, washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The cells were incubated with the CP1 or the mouse monoclonal anti-ZO-1 antibodies, washed, and incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit or Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For blocking, the CP1 (10 μg/ml) antibody was incubated with an excess of CP1 peptide (60 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C before staining. For visualization, cells were washed and mounted on glass slides, examined and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. MDCK and CACO-2 cells to be analyzed by confocal microscopy were seeded on polycarbonate filters (Cell Culture Insert, 0.4-μm pore size, BD Biosciences). Transepithelial resistence (TER) was measured over time using a Millicell-ERS Voltohmmeter (see below) until TER values between 500-700 Ω·cm2 were obtained. Cells were then fixed in ethanol at -20 °C for 20 min, washed, blocked in 5% normal goat serum, and co-incubated with the CP1 and ZO-1, occludin or E-cadherin antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. After washing and incubating with secondary Alexa Fluor antibodies (see above), filters were mounted and examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 scanning module fitted to an Axiovert 100 m microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective. Routinely, 0.15-0.20-μm thick focal planes were scanned. Immunohistochemistry—Mouse tissues to be analyzed by immunohistochemistry were paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and cut into 6-μm sections. Sections were pretreated in 0.01 m citric acid monohydrate (pH 6.0) at 95 °C for 20 min and blocked in TNB blocking buffer (TSA Biotin System, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) supplemented with 4% bovine serum albumin, and 10% normal horse serum at room temperature for 25 min. They were then incubated with the NP1 (10 μg/ml) or CP1 (10 μg/ml) antibodies with, or without an excess of NP1 or CP1 peptide (60 μg/ml), respectively, overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TNT wash buffer, sections were incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at room temperature for 1 h. After additional washing steps, sections were incubated with Vectastain Elite ABC Reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed in 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.05 m Tris-HCl at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin using standard procedures. Cell Aggregation Assay—CHO cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3.1-hCLMP or -hCAR vectors, an empty vector, or with medium only, at two time points with a 48 h interval. After a total period of 4 days, cells were detached from the plastic surface by incubation with 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min, washed twice with Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and resuspended in Ca2+-free HBSS supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (pre-dialyzed against Ca2+-free HBSS) to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Single-cell suspensions were incubated in bovine serum albumin-coated Eppendorf tubes on a platform rotator at 80 rpm for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were then gently spread out on culture plates and analyzed for aggregates in an inverted Nikon microscope. Five optic fields were examined for each sample and aggregates of more than three cells were counted as positives. Reproducibility was evaluated and found to be consistent in at least three separate experiments. TER Measurement—A number of 1 × 106 non-transfected or hCLMP-expressing MDCK cells were seeded on polycarbonate filters and grown at confluency for 3 days. TER was measured using a Millicell-ERS Voltohmmeter (Millipore, Life Science Division, Sundbyberg, Sweden). Accession Numbers—hCLMP, BK001245; mCLMP, AY259213; hCAR, AAC51234; mCAR, CAA71368; hBT-IgSF, BAC07546; mBT-IgSF, BAC07547; hESAM, AAK51065; mESAM, AAK51504; hA33, AAC50957; mA33, AAF65818; CTH, AAD17522; CTM, AAD17524; CTX, AAC59899; ChT1, AAD17523; hJAM-A, AAD42050; mJAM-A, AAC32982; hJAM-B, CAC69845; mJAM-B, CAC20704; hJAM-C, AAF81223; mJAM-C, AAF81224; hCD2, AAA51738; mCD2, AAD25889. Identification of a New Member of the CTX Family—To search for additional members of the CTX family we screened public EST and genomic databases with search strings corresponding to the most conserved regions within the J segment and the C2 domain of the previously existing members. By this approach, we identified both the human and mouse orthologues of a new homologue to CTX. Blast searches identified the CAR as the closest homologue to this protein (31% identity), which we named CAR-like membrane protein (CLMP). The amino acid (aa) sequences of human and mouse CLMP (h/mCLMP) were composed of 373 aa and showed 93% identity and 96% similarity to each other. Sequence alignments of both human and mouse CLMP, and other human CTX-like proteins, revealed that several characteristics of the family were conserved in CLMP. First, CLMP was found to share the same overall structure as the other family members with an extracellular part of 233 aa, containing a signal sequence and two Ig loops (the V and C2 domains), a transmembrane region (22 aa) and a cytoplasmic tail (118 aa) (Fig. 1A). Second, the most conserved amino acids, which were found in the second half of the V domain, in the J segment and in the C2 domain, were present in CLMP as well. Third, the four cysteine residues in the ectodomain, contributing to the intrachain disulfide bonds forming the V (Fig. 1A, C-1 and C-2) and the C2 (C-4 and C-5) domains, respectively, were conserved. Four, an extra pair of cysteine residues flanking the C2 domain (C-3 and C-6), forming an additional intra-chain disulfide-linked loop, and also considered as one of the hallmarks of the CTX family, was also found in the CLMP sequence.

Available data indicate that bacterial pathogens activate ectodomain shedding of host cell surface molecules to enhance their virulence. We reported previously that several major bacterial pathogens activate ectodomain shedding of syndecan-1, the major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of epithelial cells. Here we define the molecular basis of how Staphylococcus aureus activates syndecan-1 shedding. We screened mutant S. aureus strains devoid of various toxin and protease genes and found that only strains lacking both α-toxin and β-toxin genes do not stimulate shedding. Mutations in the agr global regulatory locus, which positively regulates expression of α- and β-toxins and other exoproteins, also abrogated the capacity to stimulate syndecan-1 shedding. Furthermore, purified S. aureus α- and β-toxins, but not enterotoxin A and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, rapidly potentiated shedding in a concentration-dependent manner. These results establish that S. aureus activates syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding via its two virulence factors, α- and β-toxins. Toxin-activated shedding was also selectively inhibited by antagonists of the host cell shedding mechanism, indicating that α- and β-toxins shed syndecan-1 ectodomains through stimulation of the host cell's shedding machinery. Interestingly, β-toxin, but not α-toxin, also enhanced ectodomain shedding of syndecan-4 and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor. Because shedding of these ectodomains has been implicated in promoting bacterial pathogenesis, activation of ectodomain shedding by α-toxin and β-toxin may be a previously unknown virulence mechanism of S. aureus.

Ectodomain shedding is a proteolytic mechanism of releasing the extracellular domains of cell surface proteins as soluble ectodomains (1.Arribas J. Borroto A. Chem.

Approximately 2% of cell surface proteins are thought to be secreted into the extracellular environment by this mechanism. The diverse list of shed proteins includes cytokines, growth factors, and cell adhesion molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), transforming growth factor α (TGFα), epidermal growth factors (EGFs), 1The abbreviations used are: EGFs, epidermal growth factors; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; HA, hemagglutinin; HB-EGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NMuMG, normal murine mammary gland; PKC, protein kinase C; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; SEA, staphylococcal enterotoxin A; TACE, TNFα-converting enzyme; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TSB, tryptic soy broth; TSST-1, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFs, epidermal growth factors; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; HA, hemagglutinin; HB-EGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NMuMG, normal murine mammary gland; PKC, protein kinase C; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; SEA, staphylococcal enterotoxin A; TACE, TNFα-converting enzyme; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; TSB, tryptic soy broth; TSST-1, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.l-selectin, CD44, and syndecans, to name a few. Ectodomain shedding is an important regulatory mechanism since it rapidly changes the surface phenotype of affected cells and generates soluble, biologically active ectodomains that can function as paracrine or autocrine effectors. A growing body of evidence indicates that these molecular and cellular features enable ectodomain shedding to regulate many pathophysiological processes, such as microbial pathogenesis, inflammation, and tissue repair.Ectodomain shedding is mediated by peptide hydroxamate-sensitive metalloproteinases, which are collectively called sheddases or secretases (1.Arribas J.

At present, it is not clear if these signaling pathways are linked and a common signaling pathway exists to regulate ectodomain shedding. Nevertheless, available data clearly show that several signaling pathways can markedly affect the rate of ectodomain shedding at the cell surface, indicating that various pathways converge to modulate the cleavage event at the cell surface. The involvement of many signaling pathways in regulating ectodomain shedding may be one of the biological mechanisms that defines which cell surface protein gets shed in response to specific extracellular cues.Recent studies have shown that microbial pathogens can stimulate ectodomain shedding by host cells. IL-6R shedding is activated by secreted products of S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, and Serratia marcescens (29.Vollmer P. Walev I. Rose-John S. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3646-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, TNFα shedding is provoked by culture supernatants of S. epidermidis (30.Mattson E. Van Dijk H. Verhoef J. Norrby R. Rollof J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4351-4355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the physiological significance of pathogen-activated ectodomain shedding has yet to be clearly defined, several studies have shown that virulence factors enhance ectodomain shedding, suggesting that this is a pathogenic activity. For example, streptolysin O, a pore-forming toxin expressed by the majority of Group A Streptococcus clinical isolates, stimulates ectodomain shedding of l-selectin, IL-6R, and CD14 (31.Walev I. Tappe D. Glubins E. Bhakdi S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 68: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Walev I. Vollmer P. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Rose-John S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 7882-7887Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Another study recently demonstrated that lipoteichoic acid released from the staphylococcal cell wall activates ADAM10-mediated shedding of HB-EGF ectodomains in epithelial cells via stimulation of the G protein-coupled platelet-activating factor receptor (18.Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Shed HB-EGF then activates the EGF receptor to induce mucin expression. This mechanism potentially increases the viscosity of mucus fluids, deters mucociliary clearance of pathogens, and promotes microbial pathogenesis.We have shown that shedding of syndecan-1 ectodomains is triggered by culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (25.Park P.W. Pier G.B. Preston M.J. Goldberger O. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3057-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 is the major heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) of epithelial cells and it binds and regulates a wide variety of biological molecules through its heparan sulfate (HS) chains (33.Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar, 34.Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Because syndecan-1 ectodomains are replete with all of their HS chains, they can function as soluble regulators of various molecular interactions (33.Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar, 34.Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We have identified the P. aeruginosa shedding enhancer as LasA, a known virulence factor for P. aeruginosa lung infection (25.Park P.W. Pier G.B. Preston M.J. Goldberger O. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3057-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and results from our in vivo studies indicate that P. aeruginosa activates syndecan-1 shedding to enhance its virulence in a murine model of lung infection (35.Park P.W. Pier G.B. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether the pathogenic mechanism of P. aeruginosa that exploits syndecan-1 shedding to enhance its virulence is utilized by other pathogens.Here we report the characterization of S. aureus enhancers of syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding. S. aureus is a common and clinically important Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that is responsible for causing a wide variety of life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, toxic shock syndrome, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and sepsis (36.Sheagren J.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1437-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37.Sheagren J.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The impressive pathogenic capabilities of S. aureus are mediated by the large number of virulence factors that the bacterium elaborates, including many enzymes, adhesins, and toxins. S. aureus is also one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections and the current emergence of multidrug resistant strains adds to the threat of staphylococcal infections. It is therefore imperative to define the molecular mechanisms involved in S. aureus virulence. We initially screened the effects of specific mutations of S. aureus virulence genes on syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding, and determined that mutant strains deficient in both α- and β-toxin genes do not stimulate shedding. Consistent with these results, we also found that purified α- and β-toxins augment syndecan-1 shedding. Surprisingly, the stimulatory effects of the S. aureus toxins on syndecan-1 shedding were sensitive to antagonists of the host cell shedding mechanism. Furthermore, β-toxin, but not α-toxin, stimulated ectodomain shedding of syndecan-4 and HB-EGF in a host sheddase-dependent manner. These results indicate that α- and β-toxins stimulate syndecan-1 shedding via activation of the host cell shedding machinery and that β-toxin also enhances shedding of other cell surface proteins. Because ectodomain shedding of syndecan-1 and HB-EGF has been implicated in bacterial pathogenesis, these results suggest that activation of ectodomain shedding may be one of the mechanisms by which S. aureus α- and β-toxins function as virulence factors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Bisindolylmaleimide I, PD98059, SB203580, tyrphostin A25, herbimycin A, PP2, AG490, piceatannol, GM6001, TAPI-1, and PMA were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Tryptic soy broth (TSB) and tryptic soy agar were purchased from Remel (Lenexa, KS). Purified S. aureus α-toxin, β-toxin, enterotoxin A (SEA), and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) were from Toxin Technology (Sarasota, FL) or α-toxin was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, size exclusion chromatography, and immunoaffinity chromatography from culture supernatants of S. aureus 8325-4.

Briefly, confluent or 1 day post-confluent cultures of normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) epithelial cells in 96-well plates were incubated with various test samples and inhibitors diluted in culture media (DMEM with 7.5% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml insulin) for the indicated times at 37 °C. NMuMG cells passaged between 16–20 times were used for all assays. To quantify shedding, the culture supernatants were collected, spun down to remove cells, and acidified by addition of NaOAc (pH 4.5), NaCl, and Tween 20 to a final concentration of 50 mm, 150 mm and 0.1% (v/v), respectively. Various volumes of the acidified samples were dot blotted onto Immobilon Ny+ and developed with specific antibodies and the ECL development reagent. Blots were scanned and quantified using the NIH Image software (V. 1.62) as described previously. Cell viability after incubation with the test samples was measured by the tetrazolium salt MTT conversion assay (25.Park P.W. Pier G.B. Preston M.J. Goldberger O. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J.

The concentration of partially purified syndecan-1 ectodomains was estimated by dot immunoblotting, and samples containing ∼100 ng of intact syndecan-1 ectodomains were fractionated by 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon Ny+ membranes, and developed with the 281–2 anti-syndecan-1 ectodomain antibody. To determine the size of the shed syndecan-1 core protein, ∼50 ng of partially purified ectodomains were digested with 10 mU/ml heparinase II and 20 mU/ml chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase for 5 h at 37 °C with fresh enzymes added after 2 h. The digested samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and developed with the 281-2 antibody as described above.HB-EGF Shedding Assay—Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells stably expressing the transmembrane construct of HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) tagged with HA at the N terminus were generated previously (27.Gechtman Z.

These cells were pretreated with or without KB-R8301, a hydroxamate-based HB-EGF shedding inhibitor, for 15 min and then incubated with PMA (1 μm), α-toxin (10 μg/ml), or β-toxin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Conditioned media were collected, and cells were lysed after extensive washes. The cleaved HB-EGF ectodomain in the conditioned medium was precipitated with heparin-Sepharose beads. HB-EGF ectodomains and transmembrane proHB-EGF in total cell lysates were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western immunoblotting with the 9E10 anti-HA monoclonal antibody.RESULTSS. aureus Mutant Strains Lacking α-Toxin and β-Toxin Do Not Shed Syndecan-1 Ectodomains—We reported previously that the majority of S. aureus strains secrete factors that stimulate syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding by cultured epithelial cells (25.Park P.W.

This binding results in the formation of sHSP-substrate complexes from which substrate can later be refolded. Interactions between sHSP and substrate in sHSP-substrate complexes and the mechanism by which substrate is transferred to ATP-dependent chaperones for refolding are poorly defined. We have established C-terminal affinity-tagged sHSPs from a eukaryote (pea HSP18.1) and a prokaryote (Synechocystis HSP16.6) as tools to investigate these issues. We demonstrate that sHSP subunit exchange for HSP18.1 and HSP16.6 is temperature-dependent and rapid at the optimal growth temperature for the organism of origin. Increasing the ratio of sHSP to substrate during substrate denaturation decreased sHSP-substrate complex size, and accordingly, addition of substrate to pre-formed sHSP-substrate complexes increased complex size. However, the size of pre-formed sHSP-substrate complexes could not be reduced by addition of more sHSP, and substrate could not be observed to transfer to added sHSP, although added sHSP subunits continued to exchange with subunits in sHSP-substrate complexes. Thus, although some number of sHSP subunits within complexes remain dynamic and may be important for complex structure/solubility, association of substrate with the sHSP does not appear to be similarly dynamic. These observations are consistent with a model in which ATP-dependent chaperones associate directly with sHSP-bound substrate to initiate refolding.

Fluorescence energy transfer experiments conducted with the polydisperse mammalian αA- and αB-crystallin and HSP27 revealed fully exchanged oligomers within a few hours at 37 °C (19.Bova M.P.

Even the well ordered wheat and Methanococcus sHSP oligomers exhibit rapid subunit dissociation and reassociation (11.Bova M.P. Huang Q. Ding L. Horwitz J. J. Biol.

The dynamic nature of sHSP subunit interactions is further seen in the reversible dissociation of the wheat HSP16.9, yeast HSP26, Synechocystis HSP16.6, and M. tuberculosis HSP16.3 oligomers into a smaller subassembly upon heating (8.Haslbeck M.

Increased rates of subunit exchange and/or oligomer dissociation upon heating have also been proposed to expose hydrophobic substrate-interacting sites, suggesting that the suboligomeric species, most likely the dimer, binds substrate (8.Haslbeck M.

These complexes have only been observed to dissociate with the addition of denaturant or ATP-dependent chaperones. The mechanism by which sHSP-bound substrate is transferred to the ATP-dependent chaperones is not understood in detail. Several experiments have provided evidence that substrate is spontaneously released from complexes (6.Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 29.Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 280: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, we and our colleagues failed to observe spontaneous release of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) bound to HSP16.6 (from Synechocystis sp. 6803) in large complexes (>3000 kDa), as measured by substrate transfer to a GroEL trap mutant or to added Synechocystis HSP16.6 or pea HSP18.1 (27.Mogk A.

A second model is that a direct interaction between complexes and the refolding machinery is necessary. Consistent with this idea, complexes of sHSPs with HSP70 and HSP100 proteins have been observed, although their functional relevance has not been demonstrated (16.Wang K. Spector A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4705-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31.Plesofsky-Vig N. Brambl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5032-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Depending on the specific sHSP and substrate, as well as complex organization, both mechanisms of substrate transfer could operate. However, the fact that substrate refolding can be accomplished by HSP70 family members not related to the sHSP used (9.Lee G.J. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) suggests that HSP70 chaperones do not specifically interact with sHSPs in complexes but rather with the bound substrate. We have produced C-terminally, affinity-tagged sHSPs from both an eukaryote (pea HSP18.1) and a prokaryote (Synechocystis HSP16.6) as tools to address questions regarding sHSP function and the interactions between the sHSP and substrate in complexes. We first show that the C-terminal tag does not interfere with sHSP oligomerization or chaperone activity in vitro or with sHSP function in vivo. Both wild-type and tagged sHSPs were then used to examine the dynamic organization of sHSP oligomers in the presence and absence of substrate, the consequent effects on substrate refolding, and the transfer of sHSP-bound substrate to added sHSP. We show that subunit exchange in solution is rapid and temperature-dependent. Bound substrate had no observed effect on the time course of HSP18.1 subunit exchange nor did subunit exchange reduce substrate folding competence. Despite the dynamic behavior of sHSP subunits, even in complexes, we find that association of sHSP with substrate is not similarly dynamic. These results are consistent with the model that ATP-dependent chaperones interact directly with sHSP-bound substrate to effect substrate refolding. Construction of Strep-tagged HSP18.1 and Strep-tagged HSP16.6 — Addition of the 8-amino acid strep-tag II affinity tag (WSHPQFEK) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to the C terminus of Pisum sativum (pea) HSP18.1 was achieved by PCR using primers including the codons for these amino acids (5′-GAAAAATAAACTTAGAATGAGCTATGTTAC-3′ and 5′-GAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAACCAGAAATCTCAATAGACTTAA-3′) to amplify the entire pJC20 hsp18.1 plasmid (AZ316) (32.Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) followed by blunt end ligation. Plasmids with the correct sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Strep-tagged HSP16.6, from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, was constructed in a similar manner, using the pJC20 hsp16.6 plasmid (AZ535) and appropriate primers (5′-GAAAAATAAGGGCCCTAGCTAACTGA-3′ and 5′-GAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAGGAAAGCTGAACTTTCACCAC-3′). Protein Purification—sHSPs were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells and purified to >95% homogeneity by conventional methods as described previously involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and DEAE chromatography (15.Lee G.J. Vierling E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 350-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A NaCl gradient of 0–350 mm was needed to elute the HSP16.6 proteins from the DEAE resin. An additional step was added to purification of the HSP18.1 proteins. The protein-containing fractions from the DEAE column were loaded on a hydroxyapatite column, which was developed with a gradient of 10–400 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5. HSP18.1 and strep-tagged HSP18.1 eluted at ∼380 mm NaPO4. Proteins were stored in 25 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated molar extinction coefficients according to Pace et al. (33.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar): HSP18.1, 16,500 M–1 cm–1; strep-tagged HSP18.1, 22,000 M–1 cm–1; HSP16.6, 5960 M–1 cm–1; and strep-tagged HSP16.6, 11,460 M–1 cm–1. Concentrations are expressed as moles of monomer. Formation of sHSP-Substrate Complexes—sHSP·Luc complexes were formed by mixing the indicated sHSPs with firefly luciferase (Luc) (Fisher) at the concentrations specified in each experiment and heating for 8.5 min at 42 °C. sHSP·MDH complexes were formed by mixing the indicated sHSPs with porcine mitochondrial MDH (Roche Applied Science), at the concentrations specified in each experiment, and heating for 1.5 h at 45 °C. These experiments were performed in 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. 100-μl samples were made for refolding experiments and 125-μl samples for size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and affinity chromatography experiments. After heating, the samples were cooled in an ice slurry for 30 s and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. For experiments involving the addition of substrate to pre-formed complexes, complexes were first formed as detailed above and then Luc was added to bring the final concentration to the indicated amount (no more than 1 μl of Luc was added). Samples were then heated under the same conditions as for initial complex formation. For experiments involving the addition of sHSP to pre-formed complexes, 100 μl of complex was diluted with the appropriate amount of sHSP, in the same buffer, to bring the final concentrations to 12 μm sHSP and 1 μm Luc. Samples were then heated as for initial complex formation. All the above experiments were performed in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. Size Exclusion Chromatography—SEC of samples was performed on a Bio-Rad 400-5 column using a mobile phase of 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl, 25 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min–1. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g prior to injection. Elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 220 nm. 20-s fractions, starting 5 min after sample injection, were collected for Western analysis. 100-μl samples were injected regardless of the volume of the original sample. For experiments examining changes in complex size, column fractions were collected starting immediately after an elution time of 5 min as follows: fraction 1, 112 s; fraction 2, the next 56 s; fraction 3, the next 77 s. For experiments where column fractions were mixed, fractions were collected starting immediately after an elution time of 6.3 min as follows: fraction 1, 60 s; fraction 2, the next 40 s; fraction 3, the next 70 s. Four sets of identically fractionated complexes, created as described above, using 36 μm sHSP to 9 μm Luc, were concentrated to 500 μl by centrifugation at 5000 × g in Centricon YM-10 concentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA). 100-μl samples of individual fractions were analyzed either immediately after concentration or after 24 h at 4 °C. For fraction mixtures, 100 μl of each fraction was combined immediately after concentration, and 200 μl were analyzed immediately after mixing or after 40 h at 22 °C. The “expected” peak in Fig. 7B was created by adding the chromatograms of the individual fractions in the plotting program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Standards used for chromatography are as follows: thyroglobulin 670 kDa, β-amylase 200 kDa, γ-globulin 158 kDa, BSA 66 kDa, ovalbumin 44 kDa, carbonic anhydrase 29 kDa, myoglobin 17 kDa, and vitamin B12 1.35 kDa (Bio-Rad). The column has a void volume of 5 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1, and does not resolve molecules larger than 1000 kDa. Luciferase Reactivation Measurements—sHSP·Luc complexes were created as described above. Luciferase reactivation experiments were performed as in Lee and Vierling (9.Lee G.J. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). After centrifugation samples were diluted to 480 nm sHSP in 10% (v/v) rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares, Oregon, WI), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.5, in siliconized tubes. Refolding was initiated by diluting the samples to 11.5 nm, in the same buffer conditions, in a mixture which was 50% (v/v) rabbit reticulocyte lysate and 2 mm ATP (40 μl total volume). Refolding was carried out at 31 °C. Luc activity was determined by adding 2.5 μl of the refolding reaction to 50 μl of luciferase assay mix (Promega, Madison, WI) and monitoring light emission in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner, Sunnyvale, CA). Luc activities are expressed as percentages relative to that of an equivalent amount of native Luc measured prior to the heating step in the formation of complexes. Synechocystis Strains, Growth Conditions, Heat Shock Assays, and Protein Accumulation—HSP16.6, strep-tagged HSP16.6, or ΔHSP16.6 strains were created by transforming a ΔClpB1/HK-1, ΔHSP16.6 strain with pNaive (23.Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) vectors carrying the appropriate hsp16.6 alleles, as described by Giese and Vierling (23.Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were grown and stressed as described previously (23.Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on Bg-11/glucose plates with 140 mm MgSO4 at 30 °C. Cells were stressed by incubating at 44 °C for up to 8 h. Determination of HSP16.6 protein levels in Synechocystis cells was performed as described (23.Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Non-denaturing, pore-exclusion PAGE was performed using 4–22% gradient acrylamide gels, using the buffer system described previously (32.Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Standards for non-denaturing PAGE were thyroglobulin 669 kDa, ferritin 440 kDa, catalase 232 kDa, lactate dehydrogenase 140 kDa, and BSA 67 kDa (streptactin). SDS-PAGE utilized 15 or 10–15% gradient acrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Western analysis of proteins blotted to nitrocellulose was performed by standard methods using polyclonal HSP18.1 rabbit antiserum at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Streptactin Column Chromatography—Protein samples analyzed by streptactin affinity chromatography were prepared as described above and in the text. Samples containing a maximum of 44.0 μg of strep-tagged sHSPs were mixed with 20 μl of streptactin resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for 15 min at 4 °C. The resin mixture was then centrifuged at 9,800 × g in 0.45-μm filter spin columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the flow-through fraction was collected. The resin was washed twice with 500 μl of 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 buffer, and the wash fractions were pooled. No significant amount of material was ever observed in the wash fractions (data not shown). Bound material was eluted with 2× 50-μl aliquots of SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 65 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 438 mm sucrose, 4.5 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 0.115 mm benzamidine, 0.144 mm bromphenol blue) by heating the resin at 100 °C for 5 min (Figs. S1B, 3, and 4A) or by incubating with 25 mm d-desthiobiotin for 10 min (Fig. 9 and S3). When examining subunit exchange, HSP18.1 and strep-tagged HSP18.1 or HSP16.6 and strep-tagged HSP16.6 were mixed at a total protein concentration of 12 or 24 μm, respectively, and incubated at 0 °C, room temperature (22 °C), or 30 °C for 0–6 h prior to processing with the resin as described above. For experiments examining subunit exchange in the presence of bound substrate, Luc was complexed to HSP18.1 as described above. 50 μl of 24 μm HSP18.1 or strep-tagged HSP1"

Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6940) Google Scholar) there was an attenuated inflammatory wound-healing response to vascular stimulus (cuff-injury). PDGF, a homo- or hetero-dimer of A and B chains, is a well known mediator of cardiovascular remodeling and wound healing processes as an inducible factor controlling cell proliferation and migration (4.Forsberg K.

PDGF-A chain is a target gene of KLF5 based on the biochemical analysis of the knockout mouse and on the partial resemblance of the phenotypes (e.g. intestine) of the PDGF-A chain and KLF5 knockout mice (8.Karlsson L. Lindahl P. Heath J.K. Betsholtz C. Development. 2000; 127: 3457-3466PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these observations, we know little about how the PDGF-A chain is regulated by KLF5, which is important to understand a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms. We undertook the present study to dissect the mechanisms whereby KLF5 acts on PDGF-A chain, and particularly to understand their regulation in response to pathophysiological stimulus. Plasmid Construct Preparation—Luciferase reporter deletion constructs were made by cleaving the PDGF-A chain luciferase promoter construct (PDGF-900) (3.Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K.

The resultant plasmids were named PDGF-630, PDGF-260, PDGF-71, and PDGF-55, respectively. The KLF5 expression vector pCAG-KLF5 has been described (3.Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K.

Cell Culture and Transfection Assays—HeLa cells (1 × 105 cells) were transfected with 100 ng reporter and 1 μg expression plasmids by Tfx-20 reagent (Promega). Cells were incubated for 48 h and then subjected to luciferase assay (Promega) by luminometry (Lumat LB9507, Berthold). Luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration of cell lysates.

A DNA oligomer containing the –71 bp to –55 bp sequence (5′-GGGGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTCCCCCGCCCCCGCCCCCGCCCCCCCC-3′) was used for analysis of KLF5 DNA binding. For mutant analysis, the underlined nucleotides GG were substituted by TT. The NF-κB probe was purchased from Promega. Super-shift experiments were done using anti-His probe (Santa Cruz) and anti-p50 (Santa Cruz) antibodies.

Construction of Recombinant Adenovirus KLF5 Expression Vector— Full-length KLF5 cDNA was inserted into the cosmid vector pAxCAwt (Takara) at the SwaI site. 293 cells were co-transfected with the cosmid vector and restriction enzyme-treated DNA-terminal protein complex by the calcium phosphate method. Homologous recombination resulted in recombinant adenovirus (pAxCA-KLF5). Viral titer was determined using the plaque method. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Full-length KLF5 was PCR-mutagenized and subcloned into p3xFLAG-myc-CMV (Sigma). Transfected HeLa cells were incubated for 48 h then lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). One μg of anti p50 (Santa Cruz) or control rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz) was bound to 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) by rotating for 6 h in lysis buffer at 4 °C then washed. Immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-KLF5 (KM1785) or anti-Egr-1 antibody (Santa Cruz). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA were constructed according to the manufacturer's protocol for the Silencer™ siRNA Construction kit (Ambion). 1.5 μg of double-stranded 21-mer siRNA was transfected into 2 × 105 10T1/2 cells using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 72 h of incubation, cells were harvested and RNA was extracted using RNeasy (Qiagen) and then subjected to RT-PCR analysis as described (KLF2, KLF4, KLF6, and Egr-1) (3.Shindo T. Manabe I.

Transcriptional Activation of the PDGF-A Chain Promoter by KLF5—We first investigated whether KLF5 transcriptionally regulates PDGF-A chain. Using reporter constructs harboring the PDGF-A chain promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter, cell co-transfection studies showed that KLF5 activates the PDGF-A chain promoter (containing 900 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site) (Fig. 1, A and B). To next determine the cis-element responsible for mediating the KLF5 response, serial deletion PDGF-A chain promoter-reporter constructs were made and subjected to co-transfection analysis. Results showed that a region between –71 bp and –55 bp of the transcription initiation site mediated the KLF5 response as shown by a dramatic decrease in promoter activation for constructs not containing this region. This region between –71 bp and –55 bp is well characterized as an element that mediates various stimuli including phorbol ester on to the PDGF-A chain promoter and is known to bind the Egr-1 and Sp1 transcription factors (Fig. 1C) (12.Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13.Khachigian L.M. Collins T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As KLF5 belongs to the Sp/KLF-family of zinc finger transcription factors that have a common property to bind similar GC-rich binding sites (14.Shi H. Zhang Z. Wang X. Liu S. Teng C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Conkright M.D. Wani M.A. Anderson K.P. Lingrel J.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), we thought that KLF5 would also bind the Sp1-binding sites as well as the similar Egr-1-binding sites. Using gel-shift analysis, we show that KLF5 binds this region between –71 bp and –55 bp of the PDGF-A chain promoter in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 1D) thus showing that KLF5 has the ability to directly bind this cis-element and mediate promoter activation. KLF5 Mediates Activation of PDGF-A Chain by Phorbol Ester—Phorbol ester, a model agonist to investigate inducible pathophysiological stimulation, is known to stimulate PDGF-A chain promoter activation by the Egr-1 transcription factor, which is transiently and rapidly expressed at one hour after stimulation through this cis-element (12.Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13.Khachigian L.M. Collins T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). KLF5 is also transcriptionally activated by phorbol ester stimulation. We therefore investigated if KLF5 may mediate phorbol ester stimulation on to the PDGF-A chain promoter (18.Kawai-Kowase K. Kurabayashi M. Hoshino Y. Ohyama Y. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19.Sun R. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6897-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which the region between –71 bp and –55 bp of the transcription initiation site mediated phorbol ester activation of PDGF-A chain consistent with previous studies (Fig. 2A), co-transfection analysis showed that KLF5 strongly activates PDGF-A chain promoter in cooperation with phorbol ester (Fig. 2A). Expression analysis of KLF5 after phorbol ester stimulation showed that KLF5 expression showed a gradual increase that was still increasing at six hours after stimulation, in contrast to Egr-1 that was transiently increased only in the first hour after stimulation (Fig. 2B). Importantly, PDGF-A chain expression paralleled the expression of KLF5. To test the direct causal relationship between KLF5 and PDGF-A chain expression, we tested whether forced expression of KLF5 would induce endogenous PDGF-A gene expression. By use of adenoviral-mediated transfer of KLF5, although forced expression of KLF5 alone was insufficient, co-treatment by phorbol ester with forced expression of KLF5 induced PDGF-A chain gene expression as shown by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2C). Collectively, KLF5 mediates phorbol ester stimulation of PDGF-A chain in a manner that is delayed, yet persistent, as compared with the acute transient induction mediated by Egr-1. This finding implicates a new pathway for the regulation of PDGF-A chain by KLF5 in response to a pathophysiological stimulus. Cooperative Activation of PDGF-A Chain by KLF5 and NF-κB—KLF5 mediates a persistent induction of PDGF-A chain in response to phorbol ester stimulation suggesting an important role in mediating pathologic stress. Among the other signaling pathways that are activated by phorbol ester, the NF-κB pathway is well known for mediating external stimuli, particularly in inflammatory responses (20.Collins T. Cybulsky M.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). However, a pathway linking NF-κB and PDGF-A chain has not been described. As the KLF5 knockout mice showed a defect in inflammatory vascular response, we envisioned that there may be cooperative interaction between these downstream factors to regulate transcription in the nucleus. We first examined whether NF-κB cooperates with KLF5 in regulating PDGF-A chain expression. Using co-transfection reporter analysis, we show that although NF-κB p50 and p65 either alone or together do not activate the PDGF-A chain promoter-reporter construct, cooperative activation of the PDGF-A chain promoter is seen specifically when the p50 subunit, but not the p65/c-rel subunit of NF-κB, is co-expressed with KLF5 (Fig. 3A). This is not due to the effects of p50 on KLF5 expression levels as shown by absence of effects on immunoblot analysis. Administration of an NF-κB inhibitor, parthenolide (21.Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5617-5623PubMed Google Scholar), blocked this cooperative activation with p50 (Fig. 3B). To determine the cis-element which mediates this response, PDGF-A chain promoter deletion constructs were tested, which showed that the cooperative activation was mediated by the –71 bp to –55 bp region (Fig. 3C). This region mediates KLF5 activation through direct DNA binding, but as inspection did not reveal a consensus NF-κB-binding site, we reasoned that p50 may act through protein-protein interactions to cooperatively activate the PDGF-A chain promoter. Using gel-shift analysis, under conditions in which recombinant KLF5 but not p50 binds this region of the PDGF-A chain promoter, interestingly, a DNA-protein complex of slower mobility (larger mass) was seen when both KLF5 and p50 were reacted suggesting that p50 and KLF5 form a complex on DNA. Super-shift experiments using antibody against p50 confirmed that it was contained within this complex (Fig. 3D). A recombinant form of the DNA-binding domain of KLF5 was sufficient for this reaction. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis further showed that KLF5 bound p50 (Fig. 3E). Importantly, Egr-1 did not bind to p50 under similar conditions attesting to the specificity of the reaction (Fig. 3E). To further confirm the specificity of this functional interaction, reporter assays using various promoters and factors were tested. Under conditions in which KLF5 and p50 cooperatively activated the PDGF-A chain promoter, neither Sp1 nor Egr-1 showed cooperative action with p50. Other KLF5-responsive promoters such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and non-muscle myosin heavy chain-B did not show cooperative activation, but tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 also showed this phenomenon which may be suggestive of the generality of this mechanism (Fig. 3F and supplemental figure). Collectively, we show that KLF5 and the p50 subunit of NF-κB show cooperative activation of PDGF-A chain by forming a complex on the KLF5-binding element of the PDGF-A chain promoter. To our knowledge, this is the first report of NF-κB-mediated regulation of PDGF-A chain. Multiple pathways, one involving direct stimulation of KLF5 activation by phorbol ester and another mediated by the p50 subunit of NF-κB on KLF5, therefore converge on KLF5 to activate the PDGF-A chain promoter. Requirement of KLF5 and p50 for PDGF-A Chain Expression in Vivo—To confirm that KLF5 and p50 mediate PDGF-A chain expression in vivo, we used an RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown approach to examine the requirement of these two factors in mediating this response. We first established conditions in which KLF5 could be specifically knocked down by siRNA transfer (Fig. 4A). Specific effects of the constructs were established by absence of effect on 18 S RNA and the negative control, SEAP. The specificity of the siRNA constructs against KLF5 were confirmed by lack of effect on related factors KLF2, KLF4, KLF6, and Egr-1 (Fig. 4B). We next established conditions in which p50 could be specifically knocked down by siRNA transfer (Fig. 4C) and then examined whether KLF5 and p50 siRNA constructs could inhibit PDGF-A chain expression by RT-PCR analysis. Both KLF5 and p50 siRNA constructs could inhibit PDGF-A chain expression (Figs. 4, D and E). Effective constructs were selected and further used to show that they could inhibit PDGF-A promoter activation by reporter assay, supporting and confirming that these factors act at the level of transcription (Fig. 4F). These findings confirm that KLF5 and p50 siRNA constructs inhibit PDGF-A chain expression and establish the importance of these two factors in regulating expression of PDGF-A chain. It is tempting to envision further animal experiments using RNAi approaches, but at present, technical limitations hamper use of this technology in animals with limitation to cellular experiments. New Pathway of Regulation of PDGF-A Chain Induction by KLF5—The present study shows that KLF5 transcriptionally regulates the PDGF-A chain with cooperative activation by phorbol ester. Interestingly, phorbol ester induces expression of KLF5 in a delayed yet persistent manner that follows a rapid yet transient response as mediated by Egr-1 (Fig. 4G). In fact, forced expression of KLF5 in combination with phorbol ester administration was sufficient to induce PDGF-A chain expression in the cell, which strongly suggests that this combination of factors is relevant in the pathophysiological situation. We envision that this two-stage regulation of PDGF-A chain expression as manifested by initial stimulation by Egr-1 followed by that of KLF5 allows for assemblage and convergence of multiple levels of cascading regulation on PDGF-A chain. A 16 bp short region between –71 bp and –55 bp of the PDGF-A chain promoter integrates these signals. Importantly, this region contains only GC-rich binding sites that have been shown to bind Egr-1 and Sp1. Like KLF5, both of these zinc finger transcription factors bind GC-rich binding sites. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that both Egr-1 and KLF5 may act in concert on the PDGF-A chain promoter simultaneously (e.g. hetero-dimerization), their distinct non-overlapping expression patterns in response to phorbol ester stimulation suggests that they act independently. We therefore envision that although Egr-1 acts as the DNA-transcription factor to mediate signals during the early acute phase, KLF5 mediates signals at later stages for sustained activation of the PDGF-A chain promoter. What signals are distinctly mediated by Egr-1 and KLF5? Indeed, it is important to understand the different regulation and pathways that converge on Egr-1 and KLF5 to understand their different functions. Our novel finding in the present study that the NF-κB p50 subunit mediates cooperative activation on PDGF-A chain by KLF5 but not by Egr-1 may be one of the answers to this important question. Given the well known role of NF-κB to mediate inflammatory responses secondary to pathological stimuli, it is an ideal nuclear factor to regulate the pathologically inducible PDGF-A chain. Our finding that p50 cooperatively activates the PDGF-A chain promoter through protein-protein interaction with KLF5 was therefore a welcome surprise. This implicates not only a direct pathway involving activation of PDGF-A chain through a delayed increase in expression amounts of KLF5, but also a cooperative effect as manifested by convergence of the NF-κB signal on to KLF5 to further provide regulation. Again, this cooperative response is not seen with Egr-1, which strongly suggests that this is a specific response that is finely tuned for robust activation of PDGF-A chain in response to pathological stimuli in a complex pathophysiological situation. In closing, we have identified a novel pathway regulating transcriptional regulation of PDGF-A chain by KLF5 (Fig. 4G). Convergence of multiple signaling pathways on to KLF5 (e.g. phorbol ester and NF-κB) amplifies the qualitative as well as quantitative nature of the temporospatial regulation of PDGF-A chain. This new pathway through KLF5 is a tempting target for therapeutic intervention aimed at modulating PDGF-A chain and its associated pathologies in the cardiovascular system. Further, cooperative activation between NF-κB and KLF5 may also be a promising target for modulation of inducible pathophysiological responses. Download .pdf (.01 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2043223273,"PAK6 was first identified as an androgen receptor (AR)-interacting protein able to inhibit AR-mediated transcriptional responses. PAK6 is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family implicated in actin reorganization and cell motility, gene transcription, apoptosis, and cell transformation. We investigated the biochemical basis for inhibition of AR signaling by PAK6. We compared the kinase activity of PAK6 with two other well characterized members of the PAK family, PAK1 and PAK4. Like PAK4, PAK6 possesses a constitutive basal kinase activity that, unlike PAK1, is not modulated by the binding of active Rac or Cdc42 GTPases. In order to test the involvement of PAK6 kinase activity in suppression of AR-mediated transcription, we generated kinase-dead (K436A) and kinase-active (S531N) mutants of PAK6. We show that PAK6 kinase activity is required for effective PAK6-induced repression of AR signaling. Suppression does not depend upon GTPase binding to PAK6 and is not mimicked by the closely related PAK1 and PAK4 isoforms. Kinase-dependent inhibition by PAK6 extended to the enhanced AR-mediated transcription seen in the presence of coactivating molecules and to the action of AR coinhibitors. Active PAK6 inhibited nuclear translocation of the stimulated AR, suggesting a possible mechanism for inhibition of AR responsiveness. Finally, we observe that autophosphorylated, active PAK6 protein is differently expressed among prostate cancer cell lines.

Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 2.Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). PAKs are serine/threonine kinases that contain a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB) domain and a Ste20-related kinase domain. The PAK family members have been implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular functions, including actin reorganization, cell motility, gene transcription, cell transformation, apoptotic signaling, and more recently, steroid hormone receptor signaling (see below).The binding of activated GTP-bound Cdc42 or Rac to group I PAKs dramatically stimulates their ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrates. In contrast, the group II PAKs, PAK4 and PAK5, possess a substantial”basal“kinase activity that is not further stimulated by binding of activated GTPase (4.Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C.

Blagoev B. Mann M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3939-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). GTPase binding does mediate kinase relocalization: after binding Cdc42, PAK4 is relocalized to the Golgi (4.Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and PAK5 shuttles from the microtubule network to actin-rich structures (6.Cau J. Faure S. Comps M. Delsert C. Morin N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which PAK6 activity is regulated and the role of PAK6 kinase activity in its biological functions have not yet been studied.PAK6 was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening as an androgen receptor-interacting protein (7.Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After androgen stimulation, PAK6 was reported to interact with the ligand binding domain of the androgen receptor (AR) and to translocate to the nucleus along with the AR, where PAK6 inhibits AR-mediated transcription. Northern blot analysis shows that PAK6 is mainly expressed in brain, testis, prostate, and breast tissues (7.Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8.Lee S.R. Ramos S.M. Ko A. Masiello D. Swanson K.D. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PAK6 has also been shown to bind the estrogen receptor (ER) and to inhibit ER-mediated gene transcription (8.Lee S.R. Ramos S.M. Ko A. Masiello D. Swanson K.D. Lu M.L. Balk S.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of PAK6 on AR- and ER-mediated gene transcription is opposite to the transactivation of the ER induced by PAK1-mediated receptor phosphorylation (9.Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5437-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).The AR and ER are hormone-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily (10.Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 11.Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The AR has a fundamental role in the development and differentiation of androgen-sensitive tissues and also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (12.Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, the AR is composed of three important functional domains, an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD), a DNA binding domain (DBD), and a ligand binding domain (LBD). In the absence of androgen, the AR is localized in the cytoplasm in association with heat shock proteins (13.Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22067-22070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Ohara-Nemoto Y. Nemoto T. Sato N. Ota M. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or DHT analogues, including R1881, heat shock proteins are released, and homodimerization and translocation of the AR to the nucleus occur (15.Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 16.Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand-bound nuclear AR is capable of mediating transactivation and/or transcriptional repression of target genes. The transcriptional activity of AR is modulated by interaction with cofactors, including coactivators that enhance AR activity and corepressors that inhibit AR activity (17.Dotzlaw H. Moehren U. Mink S. Cato A.C. Iniguez Lluhi J.A. Baniahmad A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SRC1, p300, Tip60α, β-catenin, and ARA55 are among these coactivating molecules that have been shown to increase AR-mediated transcription (18.Hanstein B. Eckner R. DiRenzo J. Halachmi S. Liu H.

The transcriptional activity of the AR can also be regulated either by direct phosphorylation of the receptor and/or by phosphorylation of cofactors (24.de Ruiter P.E. Teuwen R. Trapman J. Dijkema R.

By using both kinase-inactive and constitutively kinase-active mutants of PAK6, we showed that inhibition of AR transcriptional activity by PAK6 is dependent on its kinase activity. The binding of Cdc42 GTPase to PAK6 was not required for transcriptional inhibition. The inhibitory effect of PAK6 on AR-mediated transcription was dominant to AR coactivator functions and synergized with corepressors. PAK6 phosphorylated the DNA binding domain of the AR in in vitro kinase assays. Finally, we observed that phosphorylated, activated PAK6 protein is expressed differently among the different prostate cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that modulation of PAK6 expression and/or kinase activity may be an important component in the regulation of AR signaling in various forms of prostate cancer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, and supplements were from Invitrogen.

PC3zj is a subclone of the human prostate carcinoma cell line PC3.Plasmid Construction—PAK1, PAK4, and PAK6 were subcloned into pcDNA3-EGFP. PAK6 was inserted into the Myc tag vector pCMV6M. To produce K436A, S531N, and S560E single mutations in PAK6, overlapping PCR was performed using outer boundary primers (PAK6-EcoRI-5′ and PAK6-XhoI-3′) and overlapping primer pairs to introduce the desired mutations (for K436A, forward primer 5′-CGC CAG GTG GCC GTC gca ATG ATG GAC CTC AGG-3′; reverse primer 5′-CCT GAG GTC CAT CAT tgc GAC GGC CAC CTG GCG-3′; for S531E, forward primer 5′-GAC ATC AAG AGT GAC aac ATC CTG CTG ACC3′; reverse primer 5′-GGT CAG CAG GAT gtt GTC ACT CTT GAT GTC-3′; for S560N, forward primer 5′-GTC CCT AAG AGG AAG gag CTG GTG GGA ACC CCC-3′; reverse primer 5′-GGG GGT TCC CAC CAG ctc CTT CCT CTT AGG GAC-3′; and wt PAK6 as a template (lowercase letters indicate the introduced base mutation)).

The reporter plasmid MMTVpA3-Luc, containing the luciferase gene under the control of the steroid hormone-response elements in the MMTV-LTR, was provided by Dr. Richard Pestell (Albert Einstein Medical College, New York). The human AR cDNA, cloned into SV40 promoter-driven expression vector, pSV-hAR, was provided by Dr. Albert Brinkmann (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). An SV40-driven β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pSV-β-GAL) (Promega, Madison, WI) was used in this study as an internal control. The mouse SMRTa cDNA, cloned into pCMX, was provided by Dr. Ronald M. Evans (The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA).Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST-AR (TAD, DBD, and LBD) and Cdc42 proteins in vector pGEX-2TK were expressed in BL21 cells and purified according to the protocol of Amersham Biosciences. Buffers for the GST-Cdc42 purification contained 1 μm GDP starting from the lysis step, excluding the dialysis buffer. The GST moiety was cleaved off Cdc42 with thrombin at a final concentration of 10 units/ml glutathione beads. Thrombin was removed by incubation with p-aminobenzamidine beads (Sigma), and the protein was dialyzed four times against 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After dialysis, 1 μm GDP was added again, and the purified protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration.Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were seeded on 10-cm cell culture dishes at 50–70% confluency and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE were used per dish, and the transfection protocol was essentially followed according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Invitrogen). After 30 h the cells were washed with PBS, lysed in 0.5 ml of Lysis Buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. Protein expression in the lysates was determined by immunoblotting. For precipitations of EGFP, Myc, or FLAG-tagged PAK6 proteins, lysate containing equal amounts of the proteins was incubated with equilibrated protein G beads and anti-EGFP (3E6; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-FLAG (M2; Molecular Probes) antibodies for at least 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. The bead fraction was washed four times with lysis buffer, twice in kinase buffer, and used for kinase assays.Loading of Cdc42—Cdc42 was loaded with GTPγS or GDP under the following conditions. 5–20 μg of Cdc42 was incubated in 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm EDTA and 1 mm GTPγS or GDP for 10 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 25–100 μl. The reaction was stopped by addition of MgCl2 at 100 mm final concentration. GTPγS or GDP-loaded Cdc42 was directly used in kinase or pull-down assay.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Kinase reactions with immunoprecipitated PAK were performed in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm DTT) in a volume of 60 μl with 250 μm ATP. Radiolabeled ATP was used at 10 μCi/reaction. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by addition of sample buffer. Histones H3/H4 or AR proteins were used as a substrate at 1 μg/reaction.Western Blot—Cells were lysed and supernatants collected as described above. β-Mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue were added, and cell lysate proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and filters were blocked by incubation for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-EGFP antibody (rabbit antibody, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or anti-PAK6 phospho-antibody (anti-PAK4(Ser-474) anti-PAK5(Ser-602), and anti-PAK6(Ser-560) phospho-antibody 3241; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Beverly, MA). Blots were washed three times for 10 min in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulins. Blots were developed with the use of the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce).Pull-down Assay—Cells were transfected and lysed, and supernatants were collected as described above. Clarified lysate was incubated with either 1 μg of GTPγS or GDP-loaded Cdc42 for 2 h at 4 °C. Anti-EGFP antibody and protein G beads were then added and incubated at 4 °C for another hour. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to a Western blotting with either an EGFP antibody (rabbit antibody, Molecular Probes) or a Cdc42 antibody (SC-87, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).AR Transcriptional Activity—The monkey kidney cell line CV-1 containing no detectable levels of endogenous steroid hormone receptor activity was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Denver, CO). Transient transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Cells were plated on 12-well plates at 50–70% confluency 16 h before transfection, and 400 ng of total plasmid DNA per well was used in the transfection. Approximately 16 h after transfection, the cells were washed and fed with medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped (steroid hormone-free) fetal calf serum (Hyclone) in the presence or absence of R1881. Cells were incubated for another 24 h, lysates prepared, and luciferase and galactosidase activities measured with the Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) and Galactolight kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA), respectively.Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were plated onto 2-well chamber slides. After 24 h, cells were transiently transfected with wt or mutated EGFP-tagged pcDNA3-PAK6 and pSV-hAR with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with 10 nm R1881 for another 24 h. Cells were fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and placed in methanol for 1 min, followed by sequential washes with PBS and 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Cells were incubated with polyclonal anti-AR antibody (Santa Cruz N20816) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells were dried and mounted with fluor mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Pictures were taken using confocal microscopy.RESULTSAnalysis of PAK6 Kinase Activity—In order to evaluate the kinase activity of PAK6 and compare it to different members of the PAK family, HeLa cells were transfected with vectors containing wild type (wt) PAK6, PAK1, or PAK4. Equal amounts of EGFP-PAK1wt, EGFP-PAK6wt, and EGFP-PAK4wt were immunoprecipitated with an anti-EGFP antibody, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed using histone H3/H4 as an exogenous substrate, in the presence of either GDP-loaded (inactive) or GTPγS-loaded (active) Cdc42. As expected, significant phosphorylation of H3/H4 by PAK1wt was stimulated only in the presence of Cdc42-GTPγS. In contrast, substantial phosphorylation of H3/H4 by PAK6wt and PAK4wt was observed in the presence of both Cdc42-GDP and Cdc42-GTPγS, and the activity was not enhanced by the presence of the active GTPase (Fig. 1A). The relative kinase activity of Cdc42-activated PAK1wt was stronger than with PAK6wt or PAK4wt at comparable protein expression levels. An additional slower migrating band was observed with PAK6wt, suggesting that, as with PAK1 and PAK4wt, PAK6wt became autophosphorylated. However, unlike the autophosphorylation of PAK1wt, which is activation (Cdc42-GTPγS)-dependent, autophosphorylation of PAK6wt and PAK4wt was Cdc42-independent.In order to verify that the presence of the relatively large EGFP tag did not alter the ability of Cdc42 to activate PAK6, HeLa cells were transfected with vectors containing Myc-, FLAG-, or EGFP-tagged versions of PAK6wt, and then protein was immunoprecipitated with the relevant epitope tag antibody. An in vitro kinase assay was performed in the presence of Cdc42 loaded with either GDP or GTPγS using histone H3/H4 as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig. 1B, phosphorylation of H3/H4 mediated by each FLAG-, Myc-, and EGFP-tagged PAK6wt was not modulated by the presence of Cdc42 loaded with either GDP or GTPγS. These results show that PAK6 possesses a substantial basal kinase activity that is not further stimulated by Cdc42 (or Rac; data not shown).Characterization of PAK6 Mutants—Several PAK6 mutants were generated in an attempt to obtain kinase-inactive and highly kinase-active forms of PAK6. PAK6 (K436A) introduced a lysine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 436 in the activation loop within the kinase domain (Fig. 2A). Mutation of this residue is predicted to inhibit the binding of ATP and abolish kinase activity. PAK6(S560E) converted serine in a predicted autophosphorylation site (based on homology to PAK1) to glutamic acid. PAK6(S531N) introduced a serine-to-asparagine mutation at amino acid 531 in the catalytic loop. Mutation of this residue is predicted to stabilize the catalytic loop, as is the double mutant PAK6(S531N,S560E) (Fig. 2A). The EGFP-tagged version of each construct was transiently transfected into HeLa cells; equal amounts of PAK6 protein were immunopurified from cell lysates using EGFP antibody, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed using histone H3/H4 as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig. 2B, PAK6(K436A) exhibited no autophosphorylation nor exogenous kinase activity. Mutation S560E alone did not change the exogenous kinase or autophosphorylation activity of PAK6 from that of PAK6wt. In contrast, the mutation S531N strongly enhanced both exogenous kinase and autophosphorylation activity of PAK6. A similarly enhanced PAK6 activity was observed with the PAK6(S531N,S560E) double mutant. These results suggest that the S531N mutation stabilized the catalytic loop within the kinase domain of PAK6 to increase the kinase activity. The kinase activity of these mutants was not modulated by the presence of Cdc42 loaded with either GDP or GTPγS (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Kinase activity of PAK6 mutants. A, schematic representation of PAK6 showing functional domains and point mutations used in this study. An alignment of the kinase domain and the CRIB domain of PAK1, PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6 shows the position of conserved amino acids. Mutation PAK6(K436A) corresponds to the kinase-inactivating mutation of the ATP-binding site K299A in PAK1. Mutation PAK6(S531N) corresponds to the activating mutation in the catalytic loop S445N in PAK4. The mutation S560E in PAK6 corresponds to the activating mutation of the autophosphorylation site T423E in PAK1. The mutations H20L,H23L in PAK6 correspond to mutations H83L,H86L in the CRIB domain of PAK1, which has been shown to abolish the binding of Rac or Cdc42 to PAK1 (3.Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J.

B, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3-EGFP expression vector containing PAK6wt or PAK6 mutants K436A, S531N, S560E, and S531N,S560E. An in vitro kinase assay using histone H3/H4 as substrate was performed on the immunoprecipitated PAK6 proteins and then analyzed by autoradiography. C, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3-EGFP expression vector containing PAK6wt or PAK6 mutants as indicated. PAK6 proteins were immunoprecipitated and incubated with Cdc42 loaded with GDP or GTPγS, and a kinase assay was performed. Phosphorylations were detected by autoradiography. D, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3-EGFP expression vector containing PAK6wt or PAK6 mutants K436A and S531N,S560E. An aliquot of each lysate was analyzed by Western blot using an anti-EGFP antibody (top panel) or an antibody recognizing PAK6 protein phosphorylated on serine 560 (bottom panel). Results shown in B–D are representative of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of an anti-phospho-PAK6 antibody directed against the Ser-560 predicted autophosphorylation site to detect active PAK6 was evaluated. Phosphorylation of the corresponding serine 423 residue in PAK1 was observed after activation by Rac/Cdc42 and reflected PAK1 kinase activity (29.Yu J.S. Chen W.J. Ni M.H. Chan W.H. Yang S.D.

HeLa cells were transfected with PAK6wt, K436A, S531N, and S560E, and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot using anti-phospho-PAK6 antibody (Fig. 2D, upper panel). An anti-EGFP antibody was used to confirm similar protein expression levels (Fig. 2D, lower panel). As expected, PAK6(K436A) kinase-inactive and PAK6(S560E)-modified serine were not detected by the anti-phospho-PAK6 antibody. In contrast, this antibody was able to detect PAK6wt and PAK6(S531N) mutants. These results are consistent with phosphorylation at serine 560 as an indicator reflecting PAK6 kinase activity.Repression of AR-mediated Transcription by PAK6 Is Dependent on PAK6 Kinase Activity—It has been shown previously (7.Yang F.

https://openalex.org/W2067587577,"The expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in melanoma tumor cells was recently shown to correlate strongly with poor patient survival after combination biochemotherapy (p < 0.001). Furthermore, evidence suggests that nitric oxide, a reaction product of nitricoxide synthase, exhibits antiapoptotic activity in melanoma cells. We therefore hypothesized that nitric oxide antagonizes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Whether nitric oxide is capable of regulating cell growth and apoptotic responses to cisplatin treatment in melanoma cell lines was evaluated. We demonstrate herein that depletion of endogenously produced nitric oxide can inhibit melanoma proliferation and promote apoptosis. Moreover, our data indicate that the depletion of nitric oxide leads to changes in cell cycle regulation and enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Strikingly, we observed that the depletion of nitric oxide inhibits cisplatin-induced wild type p53 accumulation and p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 expression in melanoma cells. When cisplatin-induced p53 binding to the p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 promoter was examined, it was found that nitric oxide depletion significantly reduced the presence of p53-DNA complexes after cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, dominant negative inhibition of p53 activity enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Together, these data strongly suggest that endogenously produced nitric oxide is required for cisplatin-induced p53 activation and p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 expression, which can regulate melanoma sensitivity to cisplatin.

Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and exhibits extremely aggressive growth characteristics. The prognosis for patients with disseminated disease is invariably very poor. Melanoma is highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and therapies for melanoma have generally been ineffective at best and rarely result in sustained responses. Resistance of cancer to therapy is attributable in part to mechanisms such as altered drug uptake or transport, intracellular detoxification, altered DNA repair, and the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway (1.Satyamoorthy K. Bogenrieder T. Herlyn M. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 191-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor p53 is a sensor of diverse cellular stresses including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and hypoxia, and helps to direct cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at least in part through transcriptional activation of target genes like p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 (p21), 1The abbreviations used are: p21, p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; eNOS, endothelial NOS; iNOS, inducible NOS; nNOS, neuronal NOS; c-PTIO, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; DETA, (Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate; ODQ, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one; TUNEL,terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein isothiocyanate nick end labeling; PI, propidium iodide; PBS-T, phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20; l-NMMA, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine; AMG, aminoguanidine; 1400W, N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine dihydrochloride; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA. GADD45α, 14-3-3, and bax (2.Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2002; 14: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in a broad spectrum of cancers, and its inactivation is frequently associated with tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and poor prognosis. However, the p53 gene is rarely mutated in melanoma (3.Chin L. Merlino G. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3467-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and increased expression is associated with tumor progression (4.Basset-Seguin N. Moles J.P. Mils V. Dereure O. Guilhou J.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1994; 103: S102-S106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Results from several studies suggest that the p53 pathway is dysregulated in melanoma cells, which in turn may lead to inactivation or alteration of p53 function (5.Satyamoorthy K. Chehab N.H. Waterman M.J. Lien M.C. El Deiry W.S. Herlyn M. Halazonetis T.D. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, many human melanoma cell lines containing wild type p53 showed abnormalities in the p53 pathway in response to γ-irradiation (6.Bae I. Smith M.L. Sheikh M.S. Zhan Q.M. Scudiero D.A. Friend S.H. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr, A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 840-847PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, studies have suggested that the retention of wild type p53 may actually confer resistance to therapy in a number of tumor systems (7.McGill G. Fisher D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the role of p53 function in melanoma remains unclear. Activated p53 can bind to p53-responsive elements in the promoter of the potent cell-cycle regulator p21 and induce its expression (8.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7933) Google Scholar). When sufficiently expressed, p21 induces G1 arrest by direct binding of cyclin-dependent kinases (9.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5235) Google Scholar). Expression of p21 has been implicated as a survival mechanism against therapy (10.Roninson I.B. Cancer Lett. 2002; 179: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For instance, inhibition of p21 by antisense technology sensitized glioblastoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents (11.Ruan S.B. Okcu M.F. Pong R.C. Andreeff M. Levin V. Hsieh J.T. Zhang W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 197-202PubMed Google Scholar) and to radiation therapy (12.Kokunai T. Urui S. Tomita H. Tamaki N. J. Neurooncol. 2001; 51: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). p21 also appears to protect human colon carcinoma cells and prostate cancer cells against apoptosis (13.Mahyar-Roemer M. Roemer K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3387-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14.Martinez L.A. Yang J. Vazquez E.S. del Carmen Rodriguez-Vargas M. Olive M. Hsieh J.-T. Logothetis C.J. Navone N.M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, there is evidence that p21 may protect against p53-mediated apoptosis in human melanoma cells (15.Gorospe M. Cirielli C. Wang X.T. Seth P. Capogrossi M.C. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The precise involvement of p21 in the resistance of melanoma to therapy remains largely undefined. Nitric oxide (NO) has recently been implicated in the regulation of p53. Specifically, treating cells with NO donors resulted in conformational and functional changes and possible tyrosine nitration of p53 protein (16.Calmels S. Hainaut P. Ohshima H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3365-3369PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Chazotte-Aubert L. Hainaut P. Ohshima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that NO can regulate the ability of p53 to stimulate radiation-induced cell cycle arrest in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (18.Chazotte-Aubert L. Pluquet O. Hainaut P. Ohshima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). NO is generated as a reaction product of the enzymatic conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline by three isotypes of NO synthase (NOS): endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS). NOSs are expressed in various tissue types. eNOS and nNOS are typically considered to be constitutively expressed, whereas iNOS, as its name implies, is inducible (19.Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar). NO is involved in neurotransmission, vasodilation, inflammation, and immunity (20.Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar) and is also believed to play roles in multiple stages of various cancers (21.Wink D.A. Vodovotz Y. Laval J. Laval F. Dewhirst M.W. Mitchell J.B. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). It exhibits both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic characteristics, depending on concentration and cell type (22.Brune B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23.Liu L.M. Stamler J.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, NO has been shown to covalently modify proteins that can lead to regulation of activity, including caspases (24.Rossig L. Fichtlscherer B. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Mulsch A.

Commun. 2000; 267: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our laboratory observed that the expression of iNOS and the presence of nitrotyrosine in tumor cells of melanoma patients correlated strongly with poor patient outcome (p < 0.001 and = 0.02, respectively) (28.Ekmekcioglu S. Ellerhorst J. Smid C.M. Prieto V.G. Munsell M. Buzaid A.C. Grimm E.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4768-4775PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for NO in melanoma resistance to therapy. Presently, samples from ∼103 patients with stage III and 36 patients with stage IV melanoma have been analyzed, and similar results have been obtained. 2S. Ekmekcioglu, personal communication. Others have correlated NOS activity and iNOS expression with melanoma progression (29.Joshi M. Strandhoy J. White W.L. Melanoma Res. 1996; 6: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, Salvucci et al. (30.Salvucci O. Carsana M. Bersani I. Tragni G. Anichini A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 318-326PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence that endogenous NO may serve as a survival factor in human melanoma cells. Using human melanoma cell lines and cisplatin as a model system, we tested the hypothesis that NO regulates p53 signaling and is required in melanoma resistance to chemotherapy. We present evidence that the depletion of endogenous NO in melanoma cell lines leads to increased sensitivity to cisplatin as a consequence of the inhibition of cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation and p21 expression. Our findings support the hypothesis that NO is required for DNA damage-induced p53 activation, which acts as a protective factor against apoptosis in melanoma cells. Reagents—2-(4-Carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO) (31.Maeda H. Akaike T. Yoshida M. Suga M. J.

(San Diego, CA). N-(3-(Aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine dihydrochloride (1400W) was purchased from A. G. Scientific (San Diego, CA). Cisplatin was purchased from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. [3H]Thymidine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Antibodies for p53 and actin were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). The antibody for p21 was obtained from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen. The antibody for cleaved caspase 3 was acquired from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). p53 V143A dominant negative and pMEV empty vectors were obtained from Biomyx Technology (San Diego, CA). LipofectAMINE 2000 (Lipo2K) was from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 8-bromoguanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-bromo-cGMP), 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), myoglobin, and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—A375, A375.S2, and SK-MEL-1 melanoma cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. A375.SM and MeWo melanoma cell lines were generous gifts from I. J. Fidler and D. G. Menter, respectively. Cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with HEPES, glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 7% CO2. Cells are generally seeded in 6-well culture plates at 20–30% confluence a day before the start of experimentation. Cell viability was routinely checked by the trypan blue exclusion method. Cell Cycle Synchronization—Where indicated, cells are synchronized by serum starvation for 24 h, followed by the addition of serum (10% final concentration) and appropriate treatments at T = 0 h. Serum starvation for 24 h resulted in 80–90% accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. Oxymyoglobin Preparation—Oxymyoglobin was prepared from equine heart myoglobin as previously described (32.Espey M.G. Thomas D.D. Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11127-11132Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lyophilized myoglobin was resuspended in water, reduced with a molar excess of sodium dithionite (sodium hydrosulfite, Sigma), and passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences). Oxymyoglobin is recovered as a single bright red band from the column flow through. [3H]Thymidine Uptake Assay—The [3H]thymidine uptake assay was performed essentially as previously described (33.Robinson E.K. Grau A.M. Evans D.B. Smid C.M. Chiao P.J. Abbruzzese J.L. Grimm E.A. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 1998; 5: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated as indicated in triplicate in a 96-well flat-bottom culture plate. [3H]Thymidine was added to cell cultures 16 h prior to harvesting with a PHD cell harvester (Cambridge Technology, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Glass filters containing the harvested DNA were dried, after which scintillation fluid was added. Radioactive counts were measured with a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation counter. Terminal Deoxynucleotide Transferase-mediated dUTP-FITC Nickend Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—The TUNEL assay (FragEL DNA Fragmentation Detection Assay, Oncogene Research Products) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once in PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, PBS for 10 min at ambient temperature, pelleted, and resuspended in 80% ethanol for storage at 4 °C. On the day of staining, cells were rehydrated in Tris-buffered saline for 10 min at ambient temperature and permeabilized by proteinase K treatment for 5 min. Cells were then incubated for 15 min in the manufacturer-supplied equilibration buffer, after which the buffer was removed and the cells were incubated in TdT labeling reaction mixture in the dark for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After the mixture was removed, cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline and incubated in propidium iodide (PI)/RNase I buffer (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) for an additional 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). A sample population of 10,000 cells was used for analysis with CellQuest software. Immunoassay for p21, p53, Cleaved Caspase 3, PARP, and Actin— Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and washed once with icecold PBS before lysis. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the resulting supernatants was measured by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Twenty-five to 50 μg of total protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE with a 12% gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride-cellulose with a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with PBS + 5% milk for 1.5 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) with primary antibody. The monoclonal antibodies for p21, p53, PARP, and actin were used at 1:2,000, 1:2,000, 1:500, and 1:5,000 dilutions, respectively. The rabbit polyclonal cleaved caspase 3 antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution. After three 5-min washes in PBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 1.5 h at ambient temperature in PBS-T with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000 for p21 and p53, 1:1000 for PARP, 1:2000 for cleaved caspase 3, and 1:10,000 for actin), washed three times for a total of 15 to 20 min, visualized with ECL reagent, and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of Nuclear Extracts for Electrophoretic Mobility Shift— Nuclear extracts from cell lines were obtained essentially as previously described (34.Caruccio L. Banerjee R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 230: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed once with PBS. The plasma membrane was lysed, without lysing the nuclear membrane, in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mm EDTA supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (BD Biosciences), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma) for 15 min on ice with occasional tapping. Total lysis was checked by trypan blue exclusion. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,300 × g at 4 °C for 5 min and washed once with a wash buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol with the aforementioned supplements to remove the detergent. Nuclear proteins were extracted using a high-salt buffer (wash buffer with 400 mm NaCl) for 45 min on ice with occasional tapping. DNA and debris were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the p53-binding site of the p21 promoter was synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) with the sequence 5′-GAACATGTCCCAACATGTTG-3′ (8.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7933) Google Scholar). The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to form the probe, which was then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and resolved on a NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the unincorporated label. The DNA binding reaction was performed with 6 μg of nuclear extracts in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 ng of poly(dI·dC), and 1 ng of labeled probe in 40 μl of total volume for 30 min at ambient temperature, after which 0.5 μg of monoclonal anti-p53 antibody pAb421 was added and incubation was continued for another 30 min at ambient temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography using Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Inhibition of p53 Activity by Transfection of a Dominant Negative Expression Vector—Transfection of A375 melanoma cells was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were plated one day prior to transfection in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, HEPES, and glutamine, without antibiotics to give an approximate cell density of 95% confluence at the time of transfection. LipofectAMINE 2000 (1.0 μl/cm2) and plasmids (0.4 μg/cm2) were added individually to Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) for 5 min, combined, and again incubated for 20 min. Prior to the addition of the liposome-DNA complexes, wells are rinsed with Opti-MEM I and refilled with fresh supplemented DMEM without antibiotics. The transfection was carried out for 24 h, after which the cells are treated with appropriate reagents for another 24 h before harvesting. Transfection was confirmed by Western blotting against hemagglutinin. The Effect of NO on Melanoma Cell Proliferation—Because NO has been implicated in increased melanoma progression and metastatic potential, we evaluated whether endogenously produced NO enhanced the proliferation of iNOS-expressing A375 melanoma cells. The NO-specific scavenger c-PTIO and the NO donor DETA were used to modulate NO levels in the cells overnight, after which [3H]thymidine uptake was measured. NO depletion resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation (Fig. 1A). The addition of 50 μm DETA lead to an increase in [3H]thymidine uptake (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cells with more than 150 μm DETA caused a dose-dependent decrease in [3H]thymidine uptake, suggesting that low levels of NO enhances cell growth, whereas higher NO concentrations lead to inhibition of growth. Similar results were observed in A375.S2 melanoma cells (data not shown). In addition to iNOS, the presence of nitrotyrosine also correlated with poor outcome in melanoma patients (28.Ekmekcioglu S. Ellerhorst J. Smid C.M. Prieto V.G. Munsell M. Buzaid A.C. Grimm E.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4768-4775PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether increased protein tyrosine nitration enhances melanoma proliferation, cells were treated with SIN-1, which donates NO and superoxide at a 1:1 ratio, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured (Fig. 1C). NO and superoxide form peroxynitrite, which is responsible for protein tyrosine nitration, at a near diffusion controlled rate. SIN-1 treatment of up to 300 μm had little affect on cell growth. SIN-1 was also able to reverse the inhibition of proliferation by NO depletion. To assess whether NO depletion regulates growth inhibition after cisplatin treatment, we incubated cells with c-PTIO prior to the addition of cisplatin (Fig. 1D). [3H]Thymidine uptake decreased in a dose-dependent manner after cisplatin treatment. When cells were preincubated with both cisplatin and c-PTIO, proliferation decreased 2-fold over that which was induced by cisplatin alone, suggesting an additive or synergistic effect between cisplatin treatment and NO depletion. The concomitant addition of a NO donor with c-PTIO restored cell growth to baseline levels, which indicates that the antiproliferative effect was specific to the NO-scavenging properties of c-PTIO. Depletion of Endogenous NO Enhances Apoptosis in Cisplatin-treated Melanoma Cells—To confirm that the antiproliferative effect of NO depletion was not because of cell death, the TUNEL assay and PI staining were performed. NO depletion alone did not result in a substantial increase in the percentage of TUNEL positive cells or number of hypodiploid cells, indicating that the observed decrease in [3H]thymidine uptake was not a result of cell death (Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment of A375 cells with cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in TUNEL positivity, indicating a rise in apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, preincubation of cells with c-PTIO followed by cisplatin treatment led to a significant increase in apoptosis, which would not be expected if NO depletion was independent of cisplatin-induced DNA damage. A quenched c-PTIO control had no effect on apoptosis, indicating that the observed effects are NO specific. A similar rise in apoptosis was also seen in A375.S2 and A375.SM melanoma cells, although these cell lines showed increased apoptosis after NO depletion alone (data not shown). Caspase activation and subsequent PARP cleavage are additional markers of apoptosis (35.Patel T. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 cleavage, which leads to its activation, and PARP cleavage were determined by Western blot (Fig. 2C). The data indicate that cisplatin treatment alone does not trigger significant caspase 3 activation or PARP cleavage, whereas NO depletion with cisplatin treatment resulted in strong caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage. Cleavage of PARP was closely correlated with caspase 3 activation. To further confirm that NO depletion enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells, oxymyoglobin, a known scavenger of NO (36.Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), was added to cells prior to cisplatin treatment for 24 h (Fig. 2D). NO depletion with oxymyoglobin at concentrations similar to those used with c-PTIO was also found to enhance cisplatin-induced cell death. Furthermore, the addition of doxycycline, which has been shown to destabilize iNOS mRNA in J774 mouse macrophage cells (37.Cillari E. Milano S. D'Agostino P. Di Bella G. La Rosa M. Barbera C. Ferlazzo V. Cammarata G. Grimaudo S. Tolomeo M. Feo S. Adv. Dent. Res. 1998; 12: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), prior to cisplatin treatment also enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis (data not shown). The addition of moderate levels of NO donor prior to cisplatin treatment did not alter the level of apoptosis. NO Depletion Causes Alterations in Cell Cycle Distribution and Cell Cycle Response to Cisplatin—Cell cycle analysis by PI staining showed that treatment with cisplatin alone led to some G1 arrest in A375 melanoma cells, possibly through the up-regulation of p21. NO depletion alone led to an accumulation of cells in the G2 phase, which is consistent with the observed decrease in proliferation. Cisplatin treatment of NO-depleted cells led to a loss of G1 arrest and an accumulation of cells in S and G2 phases. Interestingly, when the results of TUNEL and PI staining were analyzed simultaneously, TUNEL-positive cisplatin-treated cells were mostly found near the G1/S boundary, whereas TUNEL positivity in NO-depleted cells exposed to cisplatin was found in all cell cycle phases (Fig. 3A). Similar findings were observed in A375.S2 and A375.SM cells. To further dissect the effects of NO depletion and cisplatin treatment on the cell cycle in melanoma cells, cell cycle distribution of synchronized A375 cells treated with c-PTIO and cisplatin was measured over a course of 48 h (Fig. 3B). At T = 0 h, 80–90% of cells are in the G0/G1 phase, which is generally consistent with other synchronized cell systems. NO depletion led to increased accumulation of cells in the G2 phase over 24 h, after which cell cycle distribution was stabilized in a sustained G2 arrest. A time dependent increase in apoptosis starting after 24 h NO depletion was seen. Treatment with cisplatin alone caused accumulation of melanoma cells at the G1/S boundary for 36 h, at which point cell cycle distribution begins to return to normal. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis can be observed after 16 h. Cisplatin treatment of NO-depleted cells led to a slow decline of cells in G1 phase and a concomitant increase of cells in S and G2 phases over 48 h. Apoptosis in these cells was seen after 8 h and increased substantially over 48 h. Quenched c-PTIO did not alter cell cycle distribution. Depletion of NO Inhibits Cisplatin-induced p53 Accumulation and p21 Expression—The p53 signaling pathway can be activated by DNA-damaging agents and is involved in the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair (38.Lakin N.D.

Sex change occurs in a variety of animals, including fish, echinoderms, crustaceans, molluscs and polychaete worms1. Here we show that the relative timing of sex change is surprisingly invariant across all animals: 91–97% of the variation in size at sex change across species can be explained by the simple rule that individuals change sex when they reach 72% of their maximum size. This suggests that there is a fundamental similarity across all animals, from a 2-mm-long crustacean to a 1.5-m-long fish (Fig. 1), in the underlying forces that select for sex change."

This suggested that post-translational modification of heparanase might be occurring in human tumor cells. Based on the predicted amino acid sequence, the human heparanase contains six putative N-glycosylation sites. Analysis of purified heparanase from human platelet suggested that all six sites would be N-glycosylated; however, the biochemical roles of glycosylation for heparanase functions have not been investigated (13.Fairbanks M.B.

In the case of N-linked glycans, more than 30 enzymes, located in the cytosol, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the Golgi apparatus, are required to generate, attach, and process the oligosaccharides (20.Drickamer K.

As the nascent glycoprotein enters the ER, a preformed oligosaccharide known as the dolicol-phosphate precursor is attached co-translationally to certain asparagine residues that are part of the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr (where Xaa represents any amino acid except Pro). Many functions have been described for protein glycosylation, including promoting protein folding in the ER, stabilizing cell surface glycoproteins, and providing recognition epitopes that activate the innate immune system (19.Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. Platt F.M. Zitzmann N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In contrast to the N-glycosylation system, several nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are O-glycosylated at specific serine or threonine hydroxyl groups. Moreover, O-glycosylation and phosphorylation are reciprocal, occurring at the same or adjacent hydroxyl moieties in some cases (24.Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 25.Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Our data suggest that glycosylated heparanase may be responsible for heparanase-mediated tumor cell invasion and that inhibitors of glycosylation may provide effective therapeutic drugs for those human cancers that are expressing heparanase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEstablishment of Heparanase-overexpressing Stable Cell Lines—The human heparanase gene was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). An EcoRI fragment of pGEM-T Easy vector-inserted human wild-type heparanase was subcloned into pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+) vector (Invitrogen). The permanent cell lines expressing heparanase-Myc-His were established by transfecting pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+)-heparanase into HepG2 cells followed by G418 selection. The cells transfected with pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+) vector were designated HepG2-Neo, and the clone expressing a high level of heparanase protein was designated HepG2-HP. To detect heparanase protein in the cell lines, we carried out Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibody.Construction of Heparanase Mutants—We substituted some asparagine residues that include six putative N-glycosylation sites in heparanase protein with glutamine residues by PCR site-directed mutagenesis using the technique of overlap extension (26.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Cells were untreated or treated with various concentrations of tunicamycin A (Calbiochem) and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2) at 4 °C with sonication. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and the amount of protein in each lysate was measured by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad). Loading buffer (42 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2.3% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) was then added to each lysate, which was subsequently boiled for 3 min and electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with anti-heparanase (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-Myc (Babco, Richmond, CA) and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) antibodies. Detection was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce).In Vitro Glycosidase Treatment—The cells were lysed in TENSV buffer (27.Hutchison K.A. Stancato L.F. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13952-13957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Simizu S. Osada H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 852-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One-ml aliquots of cell lysates were incubated with anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes in the cell lysate were precipitated by centrifugation, and the pellets were boiled for 3 min to inactivate endogenous enzymes and subsequently incubated with either 50 millliunits of endoglycosidase H (Endo-H; Roche Applied Science) or 5 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase-F; Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 18 h. The samples were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan).Measurement of Heparanase Activity—The cells were washed, suspended in PBS (pH 6.0), and disrupted by four cycles of freezing at –70 °C and thawing at 37 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the amount of protein in cell lysates was measured with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad). A mixture of 90 μl of cell lysate (2.0 mg/ml) and 10 μl of HS solution (10 mg/ml in PBS, pH 6.0) was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Following the addition of 20 μl of sampling solution (36% glycerol, 1% bromphenol blue), 10 μl of each reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE (20%). The electrophoresed gel was soaked in water for 2 h to remove SDS, stained with 0.1% methylene blue in 50% ethanol for 1 h, and then destained with water for 3 h (29.Nakajima M. Irimura T.

After 24 h, transfected cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing with PBS, they were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, washed once with PBS, and incubated with an anti-Myc antibody for 30 min. Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used as secondary antibody. After washing three times, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 5 min in the dark to stain nuclei (31.Simizu S. Imoto M. Masuda N. Takada M. Umezawa K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4978-4982PubMed Google Scholar). Then the cells were washed three times with PBS and were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Intracellular organelles were labeled with anti-Lamp-1 (lysosomes; BD Transduction, Lexington, KY), anti-GM130 (Golgi apparatus; BD Transduction), anti-BiP/GRP78 (ER; BD Transduction), or anti-EEA1 (endosomes; BD Transduction) antibodies.Assessment of Secreted Protein—Exponentially growing cells, seeded at the same cell density, were washed and cultured with serum-free medium for 24 h. The conditioned media were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and loading buffer was added to the supernatant, which was subsequently boiled for 3 min and electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The cell lysates were prepared as described before. The amounts of heparanase proteins in both cell lysates and culture media were measured by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody. Band intensities were quantified using an MD Scanning Imager equipped with MD ImageQuant Software Version 3.22 (Amersham Biosciences). Apolipoprotein E (apoE), α1-antitrypsin (AT), and albumin were monitored as the controls of the secreted proteins in HepG2 cells (32.Ye S.Q. Olson L.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21961-21966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Fujiwara T. Takami N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3068-3075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), measured by Western blotting using anti-apoE antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-AT antibody (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC), and anti-albumin antibody (Organon Teknika Corp.), respectively. The indexes of secretions are expressed by the band intensity of conditioned medium divided by that of cell lysate.RESULTSGlycosylation of Heparanase—The primary amino acid sequence of heparanase contains six predicted N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences (Fig. 1A). To clarify the role of glycosylation of heparanase for its functions, initially we established a C-terminal Myc-His-tagged heparanase-overexpressing cell line, HepG2-HP, and examined whether heparanase is glycosylated in these cells. Treatment of the HepG2-HP cells with tunicamycin A (TM), an inhibitor of glycosylation, resulted in a size reduction of heparanase as detected by electrophoresis and Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1B). One μg/ml of TM resulted in a partial inhibition of N-glycosylation, whereas 10 μg/ml of TM inhibited N-glycosylation completely (Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed in Myc-His-tagged heparanase-overexpressing HT1080 cells (data not shown). To further examine whether heparanase was indeed glycosylated in the HepG2-HP cells, anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were incubated with Endo-H or PNGase-F in vitro (Fig. 1C). Endo-H selectively removes high mannose-type oligosaccharides from glycoproteins, but it does not cleave complex glycans. Because the conversion of high mannose oligosaccharides into complex glycans occurs in the medial-Golgi compartment, resistance to Endo-H is an indication that a glycoprotein has reached this compartment. The sensitivity to PNGase-F, an enzyme that removes all types of N-linked oligosaccharides from glycoprotein, is an indication of N-linked protein glycosylation. Endo-H treatment resulted in a smear of bands suggesting that heparanase contained a mixture of both ER-derived high mannose residues and also Golgi-derived complex oligosaccharides (Fig. 1C). Complex glycosylation of heparanase was confirmed by PNGase-F treatment. PNGase-F treatment generated a major ∼50-kDa band, which is consistent with the molecular weight deduced from the amino acid sequence of heparanase (unglycosylated form). Endogenous heparanase of HeLa cells was also reduced in molecular size by the treatment with TM (Fig. 1D). Thus, these data suggest that heparanase is glycosylated in human tumor cell lines.Glycosylation of Heparanase at Six Putative Glycosylation Sites—To identify the glycosylation site(s) within the heparanase, we constructed several mutant forms of the protein in which asparagines were substituted by glutamines. The electrophoretic migration of heparanase prepared from HepG2-HP/N162Q, HepG2-HP/N178Q, HepG2-HP/N200Q, HepG2-HP/N217Q, HepG2-HP/N238Q, and HepG2-HP/N459Q cells was slightly faster than that from HepG2-HP cells, suggesting a size reduction of mutant heparanase proteins (Fig. 2). Heparanase from HepG2-HP/6NQ cells, in which all six putative N-glycosylation Asn residues were replaced by Gln residues, showed a large size reduction by electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The molecular size between HP/6NQ and TM-treated wild-type heparanase was the same, and moreover the molecular size of HP/6NQ protein was not changed by treatment with TM (Fig. 2). These data indicate that N-glycosylation does occur at the six predicted sites within the heparanase protein. Asn-203 is not located within a glycosylation consensus sequence and was mutated as a control. We did not observe any size reduction of heparanase in HepG2-HP/N203Q cells (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Glycosylation of heparanase at six putative glycosylation sites. Exponentially growing HepG2-Neo, HepG2-HP, HepG2-HP/N162Q, HepG2-HP/N178Q, HepG2-HP/N200Q, HepG2-HP/N217Q, HepG2-HP/N238Q, HepG2-HP/N459Q, HepG2-HP/6NQ, and HepG2-HP/N203Q cells were untreated or treated with 10 μg/ml TM for 24 h, and lysed. Aliquots of cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-Myc or anti-α-tubulin antibodies (Ab).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Glycosylation on Heparanase Activity—We next examined the effect of glycosylation on heparanase activity based on the digestion of HS and assessment of activity by fragment separation in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. HepG2-Neo and HepG2-HP cells were treated or untreated with TM, and cell extracts were prepared and incubated with HS from bovine kidney. As shown in Fig. 3, the sample incubated with extract from HepG2-HP cells showed broader smears and higher levels of partially digested HS migrating toward the bottom of the gel compared with the samples from HepG2-Neo cells. The extracts from the TM-treated and -untreated HepG2-HP cells possessed similar heparanase activities, suggesting that glycosylation of heparanase is not involved in activation and activity (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effect of glycosylation on heparanase activity. Exponentially growing HepG2-Neo and HepG2-HP cells were treated with 0 or 10 μg/ml TM for 24 h. The cells were lysed, and heparanase activity was assessed by the degrees of HS degradation as described under “Experimental Procedures” (upper panel), or cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody (Ab) (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Glycosylation on Intracellular Trafficking of Heparanase—In order to characterize the intracellular trafficking of heparanase, we carried out double staining analysis in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Endosome-specific (anti-EEA1), lysosome-specific (anti-Lamp-1), Golgi apparatus-specific (anti-GM130), and ER-specific (anti-BiP/GRP78) antibodies were used to label organelles. Heparanase protein stained with anti-Myc antibody was detected in perinuclear organelle and diffused within the cells (Fig. 4E). Co-staining with anti-Myc antibody and organelle-specific antibodies demonstrated that heparanase inside HeLa cells resided within the ER and the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4, R and V), suggesting that intracellular trafficking of heparanase protein might be ER-to-Golgi apparatus in human tumor cell lines. It is possible that transient expression is accompanied by an extreme overexpression of the molecule, which potentially changes its intracellular trafficking; however, treatment with 0.1 μg/ml brefeldin A, an inhibitor of intracellular transport of secretory proteins (34.Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in HepG2-HP and HT1080-HP cells, which are stably transformants, inhibited secretion of heparanase protein into the culture media (data not shown). Thus, these data revealed that intracellular trafficking of heparanase is ER-to-Golgi apparatus in these cell lines.Fig. 4Intracellular trafficking of heparanase in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+) (Mock) (A–C) or pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+)-heparanase (Heparanase) (D–V) for 24 h.

Wild-type HP, HP/N162Q, HP/N178Q, HP/N200Q, HP/N217Q, and HP/N238Q were localized within the ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20). In contrast, the amounts of HP/N459Q and HP/6NQ proteins in the Golgi apparatus were reduced compared with that of wild-type heparanase (Fig. 5, 23 and 26).Fig. 5Effect of glycosylation on intracellular trafficking of heparanase. Intracellular trafficking of glycosylation-deficient forms of heparanase. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+) (Mock, 1–3), pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+)-heparanase (HP, 4–6), or the vectors encoding glycosylation-deficient forms of heparanase (7–27). After 24 h, the cells were fixed, stained with anti-Myc (green) (1–27) and anti-GM130 (red) (2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, and 26) or anti-BiP/GRP78 (red) (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27) antibodies and Hoechst 33258 (blue) (1–27), and observed under fluorescence microscopy.

As shown in Fig. 6A, in HP/N162Q-, HP/N178Q-, HP/N238Q-, HP/N459Q-, and HP/6NQ-expressing cells, trace amounts of heparanase proteins in culture medium were observed, and the indexes of secretion were less than 0.1; however, the secretion of HP/N200Q and HP/N217Q was partially suppressed (0.24 and 0.35 for HP/N200Q and HP/N217Q, respectively) (Fig. 6B). AT, apoE, and albumin are known to be secreted in culture medium in HepG2 cells (32.Ye S.Q. Olson L.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21961-21966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Fujiwara T. Takami N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3068-3075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The secretion levels of AT, apoE, and albumin were not affected by expression of wild-type and mutant heparanase proteins (Fig. 6A and data not shown), suggesting that expression of mutant heparanase did not affect the kinetics of the general trafficking system in the cells. Moreover, the stabilities of wild-type and deglycosylated form heparanase in the culture medium were almost the same (data not shown). Since expression of mutant heparanase did not affect the general trafficking system and the stability of mutant heparanase in the culture media was similar compared with wild-type, it is revealed that deglycosylation at Asn-200 and Asn-217 is partially affected, but deglycosylation at Asn-162, Asn-178, Asn-238, and Asn-459 is dramatically affected for the kinetics of the secretion of heparanase.Fig. 6Effect of glycosylation on secretion of heparanase. A, inhibition of secretion of glycosylation-deficient forms of heparanase. HepG2-Neo, HepG2-HP, HepG2-HP/N162Q, HepG2-HP/N178Q, HepG2-HP/N200Q, HepG2-HP/N217Q, HepG2-HP/N238Q, HepG2-HP/N459Q, and HepG2-HP/6NQ cells were cultured in fetal bovine serum-free medium for 24 h. Samples from conditioned media (upper) and aliquots of cell lysates (lower) were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (Ab). B, densitometric quantitation expressed as a percentage of the amount of heparanase protein in conditioned medium (a) or in cell lysate (b). The indexes of secretion (a/b) were calculated from the amount of heparanase protein in conditioned medium (a) divided by that of cell lysate (b). If the index of secretion was less than 1.00, the level of secretion was low compared with that of wild-type heparanase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONInvasion and secondary spread through the blood and lymphatic system are characteristic features of malignant tumors. Invasion represents one of the greatest impediments to curing cancer. Many mechanisms are involved in this complex process, and it is thought that cell adhesion molecules and cell surface HSPGs are important factors in the regulation of cell differentiation, morphology, and migration (1.Hileman R.E.

https://openalex.org/W2025068714,"The human Src homology and collagen (Shc) gene encodes three protein isoforms of 46, 52, and 66 kDa that belong to a family of molecular adapters involved in several signal transduction pathways. Recently, the 66-kDa isoform has been shown to play a central role in controlling reactive oxygen species metabolism and life span in mammals. Despite the large amount of information available on the biology and biochemistry of Shc proteins, very little is known regarding the regulation of their subcellular localization. Here we demonstrate the specific and selective localization of p46Shc to the mitochondrial matrix. Through deletion mapping experiments, we show that targeting of p46Shc to mitochondria is mediated by its first 32 amino acids, which behave as a bona fide mitochondrial targeting sequence. We further demonstrate that the N-terminal location of the signal peptide is critical for its function. This accounts for the observation that p52Shc and p66Shc, containing the same sequence but more internally located, display a remarkably different subcellular localization. These findings indicate that p46Shc may exert a nonredundant biological function in signal transduction pathways involving mitochondria.

Shc proteins share a common modular organization (an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, a central collagen homology region (CH1), rich in proline and glycine, and a carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain) and differ solely at their N termini. Despite this structural similarity, there is emerging evidence that the three isoforms are not functionally redundant and that p52Shc and p66Shc are implicated in distinct signal transduction pathways. Based on the finding that, following growth factor stimulation, p52Shc is recruited to the activated receptor, phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and associates with the Grb2-SOS complex, a model has been proposed wherein this Shc isoform participates in receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent Ras activation. Consistently, overexpression of p52Shc results in (i) transformation of immortalized mouse fibroblasts (3.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T.

On the contrary, p66Shc, which is also phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and binds Grb2 upon growth factor stimulation, is not able to activate Ras, does not induce mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and does not transform immortalized fibroblasts (2.Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 7.Okada S. Kao A.W.

Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated that p66Shc regulates intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species, reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis, and life span in mammals (8.Migliaccio E.

Subcellular compartmentalization is an essential aspect of signal transduction, and, although Shc proteins have been reported to reside in the cytoplasm and to redistribute to the plasma membrane after growth factor stimulation (10.Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio E. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), nothing is known regarding the specific subcellular localization of the three Shc isoforms. Here we report that p46Shc localizes to the mitochondrial matrix via a mitochondrial targeting signal that is inactive in p52 and p66Shc. These findings demonstrate a further degree of complexity in the regulation of Shc isoforms and suggest a nonredundant function for p46Shc in signal transduction pathways involving the mitochondria. Cell Culture—CV1, NIH3T3, and MEFs (wild type and Shc-/-) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml penicillin. Wild type MEFs were prepared according to standard procedures. Shc-/- MEFs were a kind gift from Tony Pawson. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Antibodies—Shc antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (anti-Shc SH2 monoclonal). Anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma (anti-FLAG-M2 monoclonal antibody), anti-mt-HSP70 was from Affinity Bioreagents, and anti-calnexin and anti-cytochrome c antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Retroviral Infections—Retroviruses were produced by transfecting the Phoenix helper cell line with 5-10 μg of pBABE-based constructs. 48 h after transfection, supernatants were collected and passed through a 0.2-μm filter. After the addition of 10 μl of a 10 mg/ml stock solution of polybrene, the supernatants were added to MEFs plated on 10-cm dishes. Supernatants were removed approximately 3 h after infection, and a second cycle of infection was repeated. 48 h after infections, selection was performed by adding puromycin to a concentration of 2 μg/ml. Selection was maintained for 4 days, and surviving cells were used for further experiments. Plasmids and Transfections—Mito-GFP was a gift from Dr. Rizzuto (University of Padova). The plasmid encoding matrix protein peptidase α was a gift from Dr. Rapaport (University of Munich). The coding sequences for p46, p52, and p66Shc had been previously isolated in our laboratory. All experiments described in this paper were performed using Shc constructs of human origin unless otherwise stated. Shc cDNAs were subcloned in pBABE vectors to obtain the retroviral constructs and subcloned in pCDNA3.1 for transient transfection experiments. Since p52 and p46Shc are translated from the same mRNA, via alternative ATG usage, the p46 ATG was mutated to TTG in the p52Shc-expressing constructs (3.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). To generate the C-terminal FLAG-tagged constructs, the coding sequence of p46Shc, p52Shc, and p66Shc as well as the regions corresponding to the PTB of p46Shc and of p52Shc and the CH1-SH2 region were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides designed to generate an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′- and 3′-end (excluding the STOP codon) and cloned in frame with the FLAG sequence in the pCMV-Tag4 vector. The N-terminally tagged p46Shc was generated by cloning the p46Shc coding sequence into the EcoRI site of pCDNA3.1 FLAG A, immediately downstream of the FLAG sequence. p46RFP was generated by cloning the p46 EcoRI inserts from pCMV-TAG4 constructs into EcoRI-digested pDSRed-N1 vector (Clontech), in frame with the coding sequence of the red fluorescent protein. To generate the (1-32)p46RFP construct, the sequence coding for the first 32 amino acids of p46Shc was amplified by PCR and cloned in pDSRed-N1. To generate deletion constructs, 5′-oligonucleotides with a HindIII site were used together with a common 3′-oligonucleotide to amplify the full-length cDNAs. To reduce the risk of introducing unwanted mutations, PCR products were digested with HindIII and BamHI (which cuts in the region coding for the PTB), and the resulting fragments were cassetted into pCDNA3.1-p52Shc-digested HindIII-BamHI. One exception is the p46ShcΔ11 construct, which we had previously isolated as a naturally occurring splice variant originating from the splicing of exon 1 directly to exon 3. 2A. Ventura and P. G.

For transfection using the calcium phosphate procedure, DNA was diluted in 439 μl of double-distilled H2O, 61 μl of 2 m CaCl2 were added, and the solution was added, dropwise, to 500 μl of 2× Hepes-buffered saline. After a 15-min incubation, the precipitate was added to cells plated on 10-cm dishes and removed after 12-16 h. Transfection using the LipofectAMINE method was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a sense and an antisense oligonucleotide of about 30 nucleotides each, carrying the desired mutation, were generated and used in a PCR using the wild type construct (20 ng). PCR was performed using the Turbo Pfu polymerase for 14 cycles, to reduce the chance of introducing unwanted mutations. After amplification, 1 μl of DpnI restriction enzyme, which selectively cuts methylated DNA at the GATC sequence, was added to digest the wild type construct. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the PCR product was used to transform competent Escherichia coli cells, and single colonies were sequenced for the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of other, unwanted, base changes.

To prevent nonspecific binding of the antibodies, cells were then incubated with PBS in the presence of 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The coverslips were then gently deposited, face down, on 100 μl of primary antibody diluted in PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin. After 1 h, coverslips were washed three times with PBS (5 min per wash). Cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences), Alexa 488- or Alexa 350-conjugated (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Coverslips were mounted in a 90% glycerol solution containing diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane antifade (Sigma) and examined under an AX-70 Provis (Olympus) fluorescence microscope equipped with a black and white cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu c5985) and with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope equipped with a 20-milliwatt krypton-argon laser for colocalization analysis. Confocal image acquisition was performed in sequential mode to limit channel cross-talk and corrected for residual fluorescence breakthrough. Green fluorescence was collected through a 520 ± 35-nm band pass filter, whereas the red channel filter was a 605 ± 20-nm band pass. Images were further processed with the Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe). Mitochondrial Staining with Mitotracker Red—Cells growing on coverslips were incubated for 15 min with Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:2000 in complete cell culture medium, washed with PBS, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Isolation and Subfractionation of Mitochondria—Cells were washed with PBS and collected by scraping in the same buffer. Cellular pellet was resuspended, adding 5 volumes of MT buffer (Tris/MOPS (10 mm), pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose), and subjected to 20 hand strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (at visual inspection, at least 90% of the cells were broken). Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted twice for 5 min at 800 × g. Mitochondria were finally isolated at 8000 × g and washed once in MT buffer. To identify the submitochondrial localization of the proteins of interest, equal aliquots of organelles (50-100 μg in 100 μl) were left untreated or subjected to proteinase K treatment (50 μg/ml for 20 min on ice). The protease digestion was conducted either in MT buffer, digesting proteins resident at the external surface of the outer membrane, or in hypotonic buffer (MT without sucrose), leading to outer membrane rupture and digestion of intermembrane space proteins, leaving intact the mitoplasts. The protease was stopped, adding the inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a 2 mm concentration, followed by a 5-min incubation on ice. Organelles were reisolated at 15,000 × g for 10 min and washed twice in MT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitoplast preparations were analyzed as such or further subfractionated, treating them with 50 μl of 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and left for 30 min on ice. Unbroken material was pelleted for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Proteins present in the pellet (membrane fraction containing integral inner membrane proteins) and supernatant (matrix and extractable membrane proteins) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Mitochondrial Import Assay—Proteins were expressed as [35S]methionine-labeled translates, using a commercially available transcription/translation reticulocyte system (Promega). 50 μg of mitochondria, prepared from CV-1 cell as described, were incubated in a final volume of 200 μl of import buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm succinate, 5 mm methionine). After transcription/translation, the reticulocyte mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and 10 μl of supernatant was added to the mitochondria. The import incubation was 20 min at 30 °C under mild agitation. The incubated mixture was divided into two halves. One half was mock-treated, and the other was proteinase K-treated (conditions of treatment, stopping, and washing as described above for the mitochondria preparation). In a separate tube, the import was conducted in the presence of 1 μm valinomycin, followed by protease treatment. The washed, reisolated mitochondria were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained by Coomassie, destained, dried, and exposed to autoradiographic film. P46Shc Is a Mitochondrial Protein—p46Shc is entirely contained within the p66Shc and p52Shc sequence, thereby precluding the generation of p46Shc-specific antibodies. To overcome this limitation and to avoid potential artifacts connected with the utilization of epitope-tagged cDNAs, we used recombinant retroviruses encoding for single Shc isoforms to reconstitute p46, p52, and p66Shc expression into mouse embryo fibroblasts from Shc null embryos (Shc-/- MEFs) (11.Lai K.M. Pawson T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1132-1145PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). After selection with puromycin, the infected Shc-/- MEFs were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence, using an anti-pan-Shc antibody (anti-Shc-SH2). p52 and p66Shc staining was mainly cytoplasmic diffuse, whereas p46Shc localized almost exclusively to discrete cytosolic structures whose shape and distribution was reminiscent of mitochondria (Fig. 1C). We next performed co-localization experiments using the mitochondria-specific dye Mitotracker Red. p46Shc co-localized with mitochondria, whereas the staining patterns of p52 and p66Shc only partially overlapped with that of these organelles (Fig. 1D). Identical results were obtained when the mitochondria were visualized by expressing a green fluorescent protein targeted to mitochondria (MitoGFP) or with an anti-cytochrome c antibody (not shown). To investigate whether a fraction of endogenously expressed Shc proteins localizes to mitochondria, we co-stained NIH3T3 cells, which express p46Shc together with p52Shc and p66Shc, with Mitotracker and the anti-pan-Shc antibody. A partial, yet unambiguous, overlap was evident (Fig. 2A). Four distinct compartments can be distinguished within mitochondria: the outer membrane, the inter membrane space, the inner membrane, and the matrix. In order to investigate the subcellular compartmentalization of Shc proteins, we carried out subcellular and submitochondrial fractionation experiments. Purified mitochondria were treated with proteinase K (PK) to remove all nonmitochondrial proteins and proteins associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2B). Similarly to cytochrome c (an intermembrane space protein) and to mtHsp70 (a matrix protein), p46Shc was almost completely resistant to PK treatment, thus indicating that either it is an integral inner membrane protein or it resides in the intermembrane space or in the mitochondrial matrix. To discriminate between these possibilities, purified mitochondria were resuspended in a hypotonic buffer, which induces breakage of the outer membrane, and then treated with PK (Fig. 2B; mitoplasts). Significant PK digestion of cytochrome c, but not of mtHsp70, was observed, as expected. Again, the majority of p46Shc was resistant to PK digestion (Fig. 2B). A smaller fraction of p52 and p66Shc also co-fractionated with mitochondria, whose specificity and significance is currently under investigation. To further discriminate whether p46Shc resides within the inner membrane or the matrix, mitoplasts were incubated with 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11.5), which induces the release of soluble and peripheral membrane proteins (12.Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). As expected, the majority of the matrix protein mtHsp70 was found in the supernatant, whereas the integral inner membrane protein cytochrome oxidase IV (COXIV) remained associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 2C). Notably, p46Shc was found in the supernatant, indicating that this Shc isoform resides in the mitochondrial matrix either as a soluble protein or peripherally associated with the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2C). The PTB of p46Shc Is Necessary and Sufficient for Mitochondrial Targeting—The unexpected subcellular localization of p46Shc raises a number of questions regarding the molecular nature of the targeting mechanism at work. As shown in Fig. 1A, the only difference between p46Shc and p52Shc resides in a 45-amino acid amino-terminal extension present in p52Shc. The reported three-dimensional structure of the p52Shc PTB, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (13.Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), indicates that its first 40 amino acids assume a disordered configuration and do not take part directly to the folding of the domain. This region could affect the mitochondrial targeting of p52Shc in at least two ways. First, an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence on p46Shc could be “masked” in p52Shc. Second, if the mitochondrial localization of p46Shc is mediated by the binding of the PTB to some mitochondrial phosphoproteins or phospholipids, the presence of the N-terminal extension in p52Shc could affect specificity and/or affinity of this interaction. In order to discriminate between these two possibilities, we examined whether the PTB region of p46Shc is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting and, if so, whether binding to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins or phospholipids is required. To evaluate the role of the PTB in mitochondrial targeting of p46Shc, we prepared constructs expressing the PTB of p46Shc, the PTB of p52Shc, or the CH1-SH2 portion common to both isoforms (ΔPTB-Shc). To allow easy tracking of their subcellular localization, a C-terminal FLAG epitope was appended to each construct. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with these plasmids, stained with Mitotracker Red, and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The PTB of p46Shc, but not that of p52Shc or the CH1-SH2 portion, was efficiently targeted to mitochondria (Fig. 3A). The partial nuclear localization observed with the p52PTB is probably due to free diffusion of this small molecule (about 20 kDa). These results demonstrated that the PTB domain of p46Shc is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. The PTB domain of Shc has been reported to bind phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and a subset of phospholipids (13.Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.F. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), the latter being a property that stems from the close similarity between the structure of PTB and pleckstrin homology domains. The mitochondrial targeting of the p46Shc PTB could thus be due to the binding property of the PTB or, alternatively, to a specific sequence within the Shc PTB. Point mutations that abolish either phosphotyrosine or phospholipid binding have been described (14.Ravichandran K.S. Zhou M.M. Pratt J.C. Harlan J.E. Walk S.F. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5540-5549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, a single mutation in the PTB (R175Q; the numbering refers to p52Shc) abolishes binding to phosphotyrosines, whereas a triple mutation (R112Q/K116A/K139A) interferes with the binding to phospholipids. We introduced these mutations into the p46Shc cDNA and tested whether they affected the subcellular localization of the protein. As shown in Fig. 3B, both p46ShcR175Q and p46ShcR112Q/K116A/K139A were efficiently targeted to mitochondria. Thus, although the PTB region is required for mitochondrial targeting of p46Shc, it does not mediate this targeting through its ability to bind phosphorylated proteins or phospholipids. The p46Shc N Terminus Is a Bona Fide Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence—Our results indicate that the PTB domain of p46Shc contains a signal that is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. To map its location, we generated a series of amino-terminal deletion mutants of p46Shc (Fig. 4A) and examined their subcellular localization (Fig. 4B). Deletion of the first 11 amino acids of p46 (as in the p46Δ11 mutant) did not affect p46Shc mitochondrial targeting, whereas a larger deletion, encompassing amino acids 1-22 or 1-32, completely disrupted targeting to this organelle (Fig. 4B; p46Δ22 and p46Δ32 mutants). Together, these results indicate that an important determinant for mitochondrial targeting resides between amino acids 12 and 22 of p46Shc. Most nucleus-encoded mitochondrial proteins are directed to mitochondria via an amino-terminal targeting sequence (15.Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 400Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One important feature of these signals is that they act independently of the nature of the remaining of the protein. To assess whether the p46Shc mitochondrial targeting sequence shares this characteristic, we prepared constructs in which the entire p46Shc coding sequence or only its first 32 amino acids were fused, in frame, to the cDNA of the red fluorescent protein (RFP), a protein unrelated to p46Shc that emits a bright red fluorescence (16.Fradkov A.F. Chen Y. Ding L. Barsova E.V. Matz M.V. Lukyanov S.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The resulting constructs, named RFP, p46RFP, and (1-32)p46RFP, were transfected, together with MitoGFP, in NIH3T3 cells, and the localization of the respective protein products was assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). As previously reported (16.Fradkov A.F. Chen Y. Ding L. Barsova E.V. Matz M.V. Lukyanov S.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the RFP alone displayed a nuclear and cytoplasmic diffuse staining, whereas the p46RFP fusion protein mirrored the behavior of p46Shc, strongly co-localizing with the MitoGFP (Fig. 5, RFP and p46RFP). More importantly, the presence of the first 32 amino acids of p46Shc at the amino terminus of the RFP was sufficient to induce mitochondrial localization of the corresponding chimeric protein (Fig. 5, (1-32)p46RFP). The p46Shc N terminus is not recognized as a potential mitochondrial targeting signal by currently available software (MitoProt II, TargetP; available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/ and (Pre"
https://openalex.org/W1996477095,"Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is a key enzyme in fatty acid mobilization in many cell types. Two isoforms of HSL are known to date, namely HSLadi (84 kDa in rat) and HSLtes (130 kDa in rat). These are encoded by the same gene, with exons 1-9 encoding the parts that are common to both and an additional 5′-exon encoding the additional amino acids in HSLtes. HSL of various tissues, among these the islet of Langerhans, is larger than HSLadi, but not as large as HSLtes, indicating that there may be other 5′-coding exons. Here we describe the molecular basis for a novel 89-kDa HSL isoform that is expressed in β-cells, adipocytes, adrenal glands, and ovaries in the rat and that is encoded by exons 1-9 and exon A, which is spliced to exon 1 and thereby introducing an upstream start codon. The additional 5′-base pairs encode a 43-amino acid peptide, which is highly positively charged. Conglomerates of HSL molecules are in close association with the secretory granules of the β-cell, as determined by immunoelectron microscopy with antibodies targeting two separate regions of HSL. We have also determined that the human genomic sequence upstream of exon A has promoter activity in INS-1 cells as well as glucose sensing capability, mediating an increase in expression at high glucose concentration. The minimal promoter is present within 170 bp from the transcriptional start site and maximal glucose responsiveness is conferred by sequence within 850 bp from the transcriptional start site.

Because of the established association between type 2 diabetes and obesity, lipids have received much attention in research on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Lipids are believed to cause insulin resistance in tissues and to alter β-cell function. The effect of lipids on β-cells has been studied extensively, but the picture that emerges is complex. Different effects are seen depending on parameters such as duration of exposure, concentration, and fatty acid chain length and saturation. Briefly, the presence of free fatty acids is essential for normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (1Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.-Y. Lee Y. Shimabukuro M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 48: 1276-1280Google Scholar, 2Dobbins R.L. Chester M.W. Stevenson B.E. Daniels M.B. Stein D.T. McGarry J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2370-2376Google Scholar) and also has an amplifying action on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. On the other hand, a prolonged exposure (24-48 h) to high concentrations (∼1 mm) of free fatty acids is detrimental to β-cell function and survival (3Elks M.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 208-214Google Scholar, 4Sako Y. Grill V.E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1580-1589Google Scholar).In view of this, knowledge of lipid mobilization, lipid storage, and the regulation of these in the β-cell are of great interest. Recently, we showed that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSLhormone-sensitive lipaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseHSL-A-GSTfusion protein of GST and the peptide encoded by exon A of the HSL geneInrinitiatorNF-Ynuclear factor YSp1stimulating protein 1TSStranscriptional start siteRTreverse transcriptaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends.1The abbreviations used are: HSLhormone-sensitive lipaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseHSL-A-GSTfusion protein of GST and the peptide encoded by exon A of the HSL geneInrinitiatorNF-Ynuclear factor YSp1stimulating protein 1TSStranscriptional start siteRTreverse transcriptaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends. is expressed and active in islets of Langerhans and clonal β-cells (5Mulder H. Holst L.S. Svensson H. Degerman E. Sundler F. Ahren B. Rorsman P. Holm C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 228-232Google Scholar). HSL is a key enzyme in fatty acid mobilization in the adipocytes and presumably also in several non-adipocyte cell types (see Ref. 6Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Google Scholar for review). It is unique among known lipases in that its activity is acutely controlled by hormones. Catabolic hormones, such as glucagon and catecholamines, activate the enzyme and anabolic hormones (e.g. insulin) decrease its activity. The activity of HSL is principally determined by the intracellular level of cAMP, which controls the activity of protein kinase A that phosphorylates HSL on critical serine residues (7Anthonsen M.W. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Google Scholar). In the adipocyte, this triggers translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplet (8Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 251-262Google Scholar) and, possibly, also a change in specific activity. HSL has a broad substrate specificity, being able to hydrolyze, among others, mono-, di-, and triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Besides β-cells and adipocytes, HSL is also present in testis, ovary, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle (9Holm C. Belfrage P. Fredrikson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 99-105Google Scholar), macrophages (10Khoo J.C. Reue K. Steinberg D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1969-1974Google Scholar), and gastrointestinal tract mucosa (11Grober J.

The HSL gene is located on chromosome 19 (human) (12Holm C. Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Fredrikson G. Nilsson S. Miller C.G. Shively J.E. Heinzmann C. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J.

Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 286-290Google Scholar). All functional HSL proteins are encoded by, at least, exons 1-9. Upstream of exon 1 there are several exons that are spliced to exon 1 in a mutually exclusive manner. The 5′ exons can be coding or non-coding.The present investigation of HSL in the β-cell concerns structure, subcellular localization, and regulation of gene expression. HSL in the β-cell is larger than the predominant HSL isoform found in the adipocyte (89 versus 84 kDa) (5Mulder H. Holst L.S. Svensson H. Degerman E. Sundler F. Ahren B. Rorsman P. Holm C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 228-232Google Scholar). Here we show that the difference in size between the two isoforms is explained by the addition of a 5′-exon to the HSL transcript, namely exon A, which contains coding sequence. We also present evidence that the larger HSL isoform is present in other cell types besides the β-cell. Using electron microscopy, we show the subcellular localization of HSL in rat islet β-cells. Formerly, we have shown that HSL expression is up-regulated in rat islets of Langerhans and clonal β-cells after long-term exposure to high concentrations of glucose (16Winzell M.S. Svensson H. Arner P. Ahren B. Holm C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2225-2230Google Scholar). Here we describe the genomic region responsible for this effect.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted from tissues or cells according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA with the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions.cDNA Cloning—The Marathon cDNA kit (Clontech) was used to create an adapter ligated cDNA library from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from INS-1, passage 90. 5′-RACE was performed on a 1:50 dilution of the cDNA library. Adapter primer 1 of the Marathon kit was used in conjunction with a primer of the following sequence: 5′-TGAGGGCAGCCAGGTAGGCCTC-3′. A nested PCR was performed using the adapter primer 2 of the Marathon kit and a primer of the following sequence: 5′-AGGAATTCGCCCTGGCTTGAGAAGAAGGCCAT-3′ (EcoRI site underlined). The resulting product was cleaved with NotI and EcoRI and subcloned in pBluescript II SK (Stratagene). Plasmids were sequenced using BigDye reagents (Applied Biosystems) and comparative sequence analysis was performed using the MacVector software (Accelrys).Animals—Rats were obtained from B&K Universal, Sweden. Studies were approved by the local ethical committee.Northern Blotting—Tissues were dissected from a female rat weighing 300 g and frozen in liquid nitrogen until processing. Male genital organs were taken from a male rat of the same weight and luteal ovaries were taken from a 10-day pregnant female rat. Any adipose tissue was carefully removed from all tissues. Fifty μg of total RNA from the various tissues was electrophoresed in 0.9% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels. Nucleic acids were passively transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences) and UV cross-linked.NotI and BsmI (cutting 5 bp downstream of the 5′-splice site of exon 1) were used to excise exon A sequence from the plasmid described under cDNA cloning. The resulting molecule was 32P-labeled using an Oligolabeling kit (discontinued; Amersham Biosciences). A 32P-end labeled 18 S probe (5′-TCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAACCATCCA-3′) was used for normalization between lanes. Hybridization was performed sequentially using ExpressHyb (Clontech). Hybridization, washing, and stripping of membranes were made according to the instructions of the manufacturer.Islet Isolation—Ten ml of cold Hanks' balanced salt solution with collagenase P (Roche Diagnostics), 1.35 units/ml, were injected into the bile duct, filling the pancreas retrogradely. The pancreas was removed and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. After washing four times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, islets were manually separated from exocrine cells under a microscope.RT-PCR—The RT step was performed with 1.5 μg of islet total RNA, Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (New England Biolabs), random hexamers, as well as a rat HSL-specific reverse primer from exon 8, at 37 °C for 60 min. A no RT reaction was run in parallel. The PCR was performed using a sense primer with the first 24 bp of exon A coding sequence and a reverse primer from exon 1 (5′-GGCGTAGTAGGCTAGAGCAC-3′), 1 μl of RT or no RT reaction, and AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Product size was determined on a 1% agarose gel. The expected size of the amplified HSL cDNA was 513 bp.Creation of Antibodies—Using pBluescript containing HSL-exon A cDNA as template, a PCR fragment containing the coding sequence of exon A was created. Primers used were 5′-GTGGATCCATGGAGCCGGCCGTGGAATC-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-TGAATTCTTTGACCTTGCCTTTTCGCCACC-3′ (EcoRI site underlined). The PCR fragment was gel purified (Qiaex II, Qiagen) and restriction cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting molecule was ligated into the same sites of pGex-2T (Amersham Biosciences) containing the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST) cDNA. The resulting plasmid was sequenced across the insert and was found to be correct. The GST-HSL-A fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.The GST-HSL-A fusion protein was used for immunization of rabbits. Antiserum from immunized rabbits was subjected to affinity purification on a CH-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) with GST-HSL-A fusion protein, immobilized according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blotting—Tissues were dissected from Sprague-Dawley rats. Tissues and INS-1 cells were homogenized with a glass Teflon homogenizer in homogenization buffer (0.25 mol/liter sucrose, 1 mmol/liter dithioerythritol, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 liter μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). A fat-depleted infranatant of adipose tissue was obtained after centrifugation at 50,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C. Islets were isolated as described above and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Determination of protein concentration was performed using a BCA protein kit (Pierce). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide gels and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (HyBond-C extra, Amersham Biosciences).Primary antibodies used were affinity purified anti-rat HSL antibodies, 1:5000 (raised against sequence emanating from exons 1 through 9 of the HSL gene, i.e. recombinant HSLadi (18Osterlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Google Scholar)) and the affinity purified rabbit antibody directed toward the GST-HSL-A fusion protein (1:100), described above. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibody (1:2000) and the blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Detection was performed using a CCD camera (LAS1000, Fuji).Tissue Processing and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Isolated islets were incubated in HEPES-balanced salt solution (114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25.5 mm NaHCO3, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) supplemented with 3 mm glucose during 1.5 h and then stimulated during 30 min at RT in HEPES-balanced salt solution containing 3 mm glucose, 15 mm glucose or 15 mm glucose with 5 μm forskolin. After washing with Sörensen buffer, the islets were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in Sörensen buffer during 1 h. The islets were again washed in pure Sörensen buffer and pre-embedded in 2% agar in distilled water. The pre-embedding was followed by dehydration in an ethanol series with increasing concentration of alcohol. The final embedding was performed in Lowicryl HM20 at -50 °C, which was UV-polymerized at -45 °C during 48 h followed by 32 h at RT. Ultrathin sections were cut with an ultramicrotome (Leica UCT) and deposited on Formvar-coated nickel grids.All washing steps were performed in a 400-ml vessel and the reactions were carried out in 100 μl-drop on Parafilm. Between all steps excess liquid was blotted off by touching the edge of the grids with a filter paper. The grids were first incubated, during 30 min at RT, in a blocking buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% acetylated bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin-c, Aurion) and 0.1% fish gelatin (Amersham Biosciences). All the grids, except the controls, were then incubated overnight at room temperature with the primary antibody rabbit anti-HSLadi or rabbit anti-GST-HSL-A diluted 1:25 in the blocking buffer. The controls were incubated in the blocking buffer overnight.After washing in a buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20) for 15 min the grids were incubated during 2 h at room temperature with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 6-nm gold particles (Aurion), diluted 1:10 in the blocking buffer). Finally the grids were washed during 15 min in washing buffer followed by washing in Milli-Q water for 6 min. After drying, counterstaining was performed with 3% uranyl acetate at 40 °C for 20 min followed by lead citrate (Reynolds' recipe) at room temperature for 4 min. The sections were then observed in a Philips CM 120 Biotwin instrument at 120 kV.Screening of Human Genomic Sequence—A cosmid containing human genomic sequence was cleaved with BamHI and BspEI. An exon A-containing fragment was identified using the exon A probe described above in Southern blotting. Southern blotting was performed using a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences) and ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions.The identified fragment of 2.5 kb was gel purified (Qiaex II, Qiagen) and subcloned into the BamHI and BspEI sites of the pTriAmp vector. The subcloned fragment was sequenced in both directions using the BigDye reagent (Applied Biosystems). The sequence was found to be essentially identical to a sequence with GenBank™ accession number AC011497 (human chromosome 19).Determination of Transcriptional Start Site (TSS)—Poly(A)+ RNA (250 ng) from INS-1 cells and rat tissues (adipose tissue or ovary), respectively, were treated with the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion). 5′-RACE was performed according to instructions of the manufacturer, using a gene-specific primer of the following sequence: 5′-GGCGTAGTAGGCTAGAGCAC-3′. Two μl of this PCR was used for nested PCR using a gene-specific primer of the following sequence: 5′-GATGAATTCACAGGTAGGCCTCCAGTTC-3′ (EcoRI site underlined). Both primers contain antisense sequence from exon 1 of the rat HSL gene. The resulting products were subcloned in pBluescript II SK and sequenced. Alternatively, the nested PCR was performed using an exon A-specific reverse primer (5′-TGAATTCTTTGACCTTGCCTTTTCGCCACC-3′; EcoRI site underlined). The size of the resulting products was determined on a 3% MetaPhor-agarose gel (FMC BioProducts).Creation of Luciferase Expressing Vectors—Sense and antisense primers that were complementary to sequence at the stated distances from the exon A TSS were created (DNA Technology, Aarhus, Denmark). Primers contained NheI or HindIII restriction sites in the 5′-end for cloning of PCR products into these sites of the pGL3basic vector (Promega). PCR was performed using proofreading DNA polymerase (Vent, New England Biolabs; or Platinum Pfx, Invitrogen).Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay—INS-1 cells (p85-98) were grown in 24-well plates and transfected at ∼80% confluence with empty pGL3basic vector (which contains a Firefly luciferase gene) or pGL3basic containing sequence upstream of exon A (1 μg/well) and pRL-CMV (which contains a Renilla luciferase gene) (10 ng/well). Transfection was performed using 2 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche). Each pGL-construct was added to three wells for each experimental condition in each experiment. The cells were incubated for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed. Twenty μl of cell lysate was used in the subsequent assay performed in a Wallac 1420 luminometer with dual luciferase reporter assay reagents (Promega). Lysate of uninfected cells was used as blank. The capacity of each DNA insert to yield firefly luciferase activity is expressed relative to that of empty pGL3basic at each experimental condition. Variation in transfection efficiency between wells was normalized for using Renilla luciferase activity.Statistical Analysis—Means and S.E. ± mean were calculated. Student's t test for unpaired data was used and differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSHSL of the pancreatic β-cell is slightly larger (89 versus 84 kDa) than the predominant isoform found in adipocytes, referred to as HSLadi, as evident when lysates of clonal β-cell or islets from mouse and rat are subjected to immunoblot analysis (5Mulder H. Holst L.S. Svensson H. Degerman E. Sundler F. Ahren B. Rorsman P. Holm C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 228-232Google Scholar). To resolve the sequence of the HSL transcript of the β-cell responsible for the difference in protein chain length, INS-1 cell mRNA was subjected to 5′-RACE using a gene-specific antisense primer with HSL exon 1 sequence. The RACE product obtained contained, in addition to the expected sequence from exon 1, sequence from exon A. Exon A has formerly been subcloned by use of the same technique from adipocytes of mouse (19Laurin N.N. Wang S.P. Mitchell G.A. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 972-978Google Scholar) and human (20Grober J.

The sequences were found to be similar (95% identity between rat and mouse and ∼70% identity between all three species). Mouse and human sequences both exhibit translation start codons in-frame with the exon 1 ATG. Fig. 1C depicts the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by exon A in rat, mouse, and human. The peptides display strong positive charge and have a molecular mass of ∼5 kDa, which well explains the observed difference in mobility between the two isoforms upon SDS-PAGE. Rat and mouse HSLadi share 94% identity at the protein level, whereas rat and human share 83% (12Holm C. Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Fredrikson G. Nilsson S. Miller C.G. Shively J.E. Heinzmann C.

The novel HSL region described here consists of 43 amino acids and the level of homology between rat and mouse is similar to that of the rest of the protein. The homology, however, between rat and human is considerably lower (∼50%). A lower degree of sequence identity (∼30%) between rat and human has previously been described also for the testis-specific domain of HSL (14Holst L.S. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 441-447Google Scholar).To determine whether exon A-containing transcripts were present in cell types other than the β-cell, Northern blot analyses were performed using a radiolabeled exon A probe. Exon A sequences were detected in adipose tissue, adrenal glands, ovaries with and without corpora lutea, and INS-1 cells (Fig. 2A). Because of the difficulties to obtain large quantities of pure rat islets of Langerhans, a lesser amount of RNA from rat islets was used to perform RT-PCR. When using an exon A forward primer and an exon 1 reverse primer, an amplicon of the expected size was retrieved, whereas the negative control (no RT) was devoid of product (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Detection of HSL exon A in transcripts from rat tissues.A, Northern blot analyses were performed using 50 μg of total RNA from each stated tissue and INS-1 cells and radiolabeled probes containing exon A sequence and 18 S sequence, respectively. Exon A-containing transcripts were found in RNA from adipose tissue, adrenal glands, ovaries, and INS-1 cells. B, RT-PCR analysis of islets of Langerhans using 1.5 μg of total RNA from rat islets and primers from exon A (sense) and exon 1 (antisense). The figure shows a band of the expected size (513 bp), resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and no product in the no RT control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Splicing of exon A to exons 1-9 yields a transcript that contains a translation start codon 129 bases upstream from the ATG in exon 1. Twenty of these nucleotides are derived from exon 1. It is not known whether the start codon in exon A is used in tissues. To find out whether the discovered transcript is translated into protein, affinity purified antibodies from a rabbit immunized with a fusion protein consisting of GST and a peptide encoded by rat exon A (GST-HSL-A) were used. Homogenates of adrenal glands, ovaries, islets, liver, and adipose tissue infranatant were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against HSLadi (derived from exons 1-9) and anti-GST-HSL-A, respectively. Anti-HSLadi detected bands of 84 and 89 kDa in adipose tissue, adrenal glands, and ovaries (Fig. 3A). No HSL protein was detected in liver. In islets of Langerhans, a 89-kDa band was detected by anti-HSLadi (Fig. 3B). Anti-GST-HSL-A detected bands of 89 kDa in all tissues examined, except in liver (Fig. 3, A and B). These results demonstrate that exon A is, in fact, translated into protein sequence and that the exon A-containing transcript encodes a larger isoform than the predominant HSL isoform in adipocytes.Fig. 3Western blots with rat protein analyzed with HSL antibodies.A, a Western blot with two identical halves, each containing 20 μg of protein/lane from stated tissues, was cut down the middle and analyzed using one antibody for each half. Anti-HSLadi detects an 84-kDa band and an 89-kDa band in adipose tissue, ovaries, and adrenal glands. Recombinant rat-HSLadi was added as a positive control. Anti-HSL-A-GST, yields an 89-kDa band in all tissues except liver. Recombinant HSLadi is not recognized by this antibody. B, using the same strategy as above, a Western blot analysis with lysate of 200 rat islets, ∼100 μg of INS-1 protein, and recombinant HSLadi was performed. Both antibodies detect only the 89-kDa band in islets and INS-1 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Subcellular Localization of HSL in the β-Cell—Rat islets for immunoelectron microscopy were incubated in 3, 15, or 15 mm glucose with 5 μm forskolin, before fixation, to examine whether the subcellular localization of HSL varied under these conditions. We found no differences in localization between these experimental groups and therefore only results from one are shown (high glucose + forskolin). The two HSL antibodies, used for Western blot analysis, and gold-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect HSL in adjacent islet sections (Figs. 4 and 5). Immunolabeling was detected as conglomerates of gold particles in association with insulin granules in β-cells. The appearance of the HSL immunolabeling was virtually identical with the two antibodies.Fig. 4TEM micrographs of a section of β-cells from islets of Langerhans (adult rat), stained using anti-HSLadi. Labeling of HSL was performed with anti-rat HSLadi, as a primary antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated with a gold particle (6 nm).

Using HSL-derived reverse primers and the RACE kit adapter primers, a single amplicon was obtained from each tissue at each experimental condition and these corresponded to 5′-untranslated regions between 41 and 47 bp, as detected either by subcloning with subsequent sequencing or size determination on MetaPhor-agarose gels (results not shown). This result was extrapolated to the human genomic sequence, when making constructs for the promoter studies described below.Promoter Activity of the Genomic Region Upstream of Exon A—A fragment of human genomic DNA containing exon A was identified using subcloned rat exon A as a probe in Southern blotting.

https://openalex.org/W2010957354,"The majority of bacterial membrane-bound NiFe-hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases have homologous membrane-integral cytochrome b subunits. The prototypic NiFe-hydrogenase of Wolinella succinogenes (HydABC complex) catalyzes H2 oxidation by menaquinone during anaerobic respiration and contains a membrane-integral cytochrome b subunit (HydC) that carries the menaquinone reduction site. Using the crystal structure of the homologous FdnI subunit of Escherichia coli formate dehydrogenase-N as a model, the HydC protein was modified to examine residues thought to be involved in menaquinone binding. Variant HydABC complexes were produced in W. succinogenes, and several conserved HydC residues were identified that are essential for growth with H2 as electron donor and for quinone reduction by H2. Modification of HydC with a C-terminal Strep-tag II enabled one-step purification of the HydABC complex by Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography. The tagged HydC, separated from HydAB by isoelectric focusing, was shown to contain 1.9 mol of heme b/mol of HydC demonstrating that HydC ligates both heme b groups. The four histidine residues predicted as axial heme b ligands were individually replaced by alanine in Strep-tagged HydC. Replacement of either histidine ligand of the heme b group proximal to HydAB led to HydABC preparations that contained only one heme b group. This remaining heme b could be completely reduced by quinone supporting the view that the menaquinone reduction site is located near the distal heme b group. The results indicate that both heme b groups are involved in electron transport and that the architecture of the menaquinone reduction site near the cytoplasmic side of the membrane is similar to that proposed for E. coli FdnI.

The results indicate that both heme b groups are involved in electron transport and that the architecture of the menaquinone reduction site near the cytoplasmic side of the membrane is similar to that proposed for E. coli FdnI. Hydrogen gas (H2) and formate are commonly used as low potential electron donors in microbial metabolism, for example in anaerobic respiration. H2 is converted by hydrogenases into protons and electrons, while formate dehydrogenase catalyzes formate oxidation to yield CO2, a proton, and two electrons. NiFe-hydrogenases are a widespread class of hydrogenases that contain nickel and iron at the active site of H2 oxidation (1.Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Meyer J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 455-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Minimally, NiFe-hydrogenases consist of a large subunit harboring the NiFe site and a small subunit with three iron-sulfur clusters that form an electron-transferring conduit to the NiFe center. High resolution structures of several heterodimeric NiFe-hydrogenases are available (1.Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Meyer J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 455-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In many microorganisms, heterodimeric NiFe-hydrogenases are bound to the membrane via a cytochrome b subunit. Formate dehydrogenases are molybdoenzymes that consist of a formate-oxidizing subunit containing bismolybdopterin guanine dinucleotide and an iron-sulfur subunit with four [4Fe-4S] centers. The heterodimer is bound to the membrane by a cytochrome b that is similar to those anchoring NiFe-hydrogenases (3.Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These hydrophobic subunits are here collectively referred to as the HydC/FdnI family (see below for nomenclature). The primary structures of the family members contain four conserved histidine residues that are thought to axially ligate two heme b groups (3.Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A.

An alignment of the primary structures of the HydC/FdnI family is presented by Berks et al. (3.Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of Escherichia coli formate dehydrogenase-N was determined recently (6.Jormakka M. Törnroth S. Byrne B. Iwata S. Science. 2002; 295: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This heterotrimeric complex catalyzes formate oxidation by menaquinone and comprises the molybdoprotein FdnG, the iron-sulfur protein FdnH, and the membrane-bound FdnI. The latter subunit is a diheme cytochrome b typical of the HydC/FdnI family and contains four transmembrane helices. Another transmembrane helix is formed by a hydrophobic segment near the C terminus of FdnH. The crystal structure proved that the four conserved histidines of FdnI serve as axial ligands to the heme b iron atoms. The quinone reduction inhibitor HQNO 1The abbreviations used are: HQNO, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide; Δp, electrochemical proton potential; DMN, 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone; DMNH2, 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinol. 1The abbreviations used are: HQNO, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide; Δp, electrochemical proton potential; DMN, 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone; DMNH2, 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinol. is bound to FdnI in the crystal structure of the E. coli FdnGHI complex. The HQNO binding site, which is likely to be identical with the menaquinone reduction site, is situated near the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, whereas the FdnG and FdnH subunits were shown to be oriented to the periplasmic side (7.Stanley N.R. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Shi J. Stewart V. Palmer T. Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1005-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that protons required for menaquinone reduction are taken up from the cytoplasm, whereas protons generated upon formate oxidation are released into the periplasm. This would make formate oxidation by menaquinone an electrogenic process generating a Δp across the membrane by a so-called redox loop mechanism (3.Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A.

The NiFe-hydrogenase of W. succinogenes is a membrane-bound heterotrimeric complex oriented to the periplasmic space that consists of two hydrophilic (HydA and HydB) and one hydrophobic subunit (HydC). HydB is the large subunit containing the NiFe site, HydA is the iron-sulfur subunit, and HydC is the membrane-bound cytochrome b (11.Kröger A. Biel S. Simon J. Gross R. Unden G. Lancaster C.R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 23-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12.Simon J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 285-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HydABC complex is anchored to the membrane by both HydC and the hydrophobic C terminus of HydA, which is predicted to traverse the membrane once, similar to the C-terminal helix of E. coli FdnH. Mutants of W. succinogenes forming only one of these anchors still contained HydB bound to the membrane and catalyzed H2 oxidation by benzyl viologen (16.Gross R. Simon J. Theis F. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the absence of both anchors, hydrogenase was found to be present exclusively in the periplasm. A W. succinogenes mutant that lacks the consecutive hydABC genes did not grow by anaerobic respiration with H2 as electron donor and did not contain hydrogenase activity demonstrating that the HydABC complex is the only hydrogenase in W. succinogenes (16.Gross R. Simon J. Theis F. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A genetic system allowing expression of mutated hydABC genes in W. succinogenes has been established (16.Gross R. Simon J. Theis F. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Isolated hydrogenase from W. succinogenes obtained by chromatofocusing of the membrane extract as described by Dross et al. (17.Dross F. Geisler V. Lenger R. Theis F. Krafft T. Fahrenholz F. Kojro E. Duchêne A. Tripier D. Juvenal K. Kröger A. Eur. J.

Lancaster C.R.D. Kröger A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The HydABC form contained 1.6 mol of heme b/mol of nickel and catalyzed DMN reduction by H2 in contrast to the HydAB form, which lacked heme b and DMN reduction activity. These results indicated that HydC is essential for quinone reactivity and that the HydABC complex carries two heme b groups. The midpoint potentials of the two heme b groups were determined as –240 and –100 mV relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (4.Gross R. Simon J. Lancaster C.R.D. Kröger A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The heterotrimeric formate dehydrogenase complex (FdhABC) of W. succinogenes is homologous to the E. coli FdnGHI complex (11.Kröger A.

Rev. 2002; 26: 285-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in NiFe-hydrogenase, the hydrophilic part of W. succinogenes formate dehydrogenase has been shown to be oriented toward the periplasmic side of the membrane (18.Kröger A. Dorrer E. Winkler E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 589: 118-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The generation of Δp by either H2 or formate oxidation with DMN as electron acceptor has been demonstrated experimentally using intact cells of W. succinogenes, inverted membrane vesicles, or proteoliposomes (11.Kröger A.

The H+/e ratio for both reactions was determined to be close to 1.0 thus strongly supporting the redox loop mechanism of Δp generation (20.Biel S. Simon J. Gross R. Ruiz T. Ruitenberg M. Kröger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Based on the HQNO-occupied site in E. coli FdnI, site-directed modification of W. succinogenes HydC was performed to investigate its menaquinone binding site. Furthermore the predicted heme b-ligating histidine residues were replaced in HydC carrying a Strep-tag II. This allowed one-step purification of wild-type and variant HydC proteins and the determination of their heme b content. A sophisticated model of the membrane-bound part of W. succinogenes NiFe-hydrogenase is presented and compared with other membrane-bound diheme cytochromes b that are part of respiratory electron transport chains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacteria and Growth Conditions—W. succinogenes was grown with H2 or formate as electron donor and with fumarate or nitrate as electron acceptor as described previously (21.Bronder M. Mell M. Stupperich E. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 131: 213-223Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22.Lorenzen J.P. Kröger A. Unden G. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 477-483Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For growth with H2, the cultures were stirred under an atmosphere of H2 (150 kilopascals). Kanamycin (25 mg/liter) and chloramphenicol (12.5 mg/liter) were added when indicated. E. coli XL-1 Blue cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in NZYM medium (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ampicillin (100 mg/liter), kanamycin (50 mg/liter), and chloramphenicol (25 mg/liter) were added to the medium as appropriate.Cell Fractionation and Enzyme Activities—W. succinogenes cells harvested in the exponential growth phase were suspended (10 g of cell protein/liter) in an anoxic buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The suspension was passed through a French press at 130 megapascals and at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The resulting cell homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to yield the membrane fraction (sediment) and the soluble fraction. The reduction of benzyl viologen or DMN by H2 was recorded photometrically as described previously (17.Dross F. Geisler V. Lenger R. Theis F. Krafft T. Fahrenholz F. Kojro E. Duchêne A. Tripier D.

Electron transport with H2 as electron donor and fumarate as electron acceptor was recorded photometrically using intact bacteria as described previously (24.Unden G. Kröger A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity was equivalent to the consumption of 1 μmol of H2/min at 37 °C. Protein was measured using the Biuret method with KCN (25.Bode C. Goebell H. Stähler E. Z. Klin. Chem. Klin. Biochem. 1968; 6: 418-422PubMed Google Scholar).Purification of W. succinogenes NiFe-hydrogenase by Strep-Tactin Affinity Chromatography—The membrane fraction (20 g of protein/liter) of cells grown with formate and fumarate was suspended in a buffer (pH 7.3) containing 50 mm Tris acetate and Triton X-100 (1 g/g of protein). The suspension was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g) the membrane extract (supernatant) was applied to a Strep-Tactin Sepharose column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) that was equilibrated with the same buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. After washing the column with equilibration buffer, Strep-tagged proteins were eluted with a buffer (pH 7.3) containing 50 mm Tris acetate, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 5 mm desthiobiotin.Separation of Strep-tagged HydC and HydAB—The HydABC complex from W. succinogenes HydC-Strep was subjected to isoelectric focusing as described previously (4.Gross R. Simon J. Lancaster C.R.D. Kröger A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The pH range of the ampholytes was 6–9 (Servalyt 6–9), and dodecyl maltoside (0.01%) and decyl maltoside (0.1%) were added to the Ampholine solution. The gel bands containing HydAB (at pH ∼7.5) and Strep-tagged HydC (at pH ∼8.5) were cut out. The gel material and the Ampholine were removed from the samples as described previously (4.Gross R. Simon J. Lancaster C.R.D. Kröger A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Construction of W. succinogenes hyd Mutant Strains—The hydC mutant strains were generated by transforming W. succinogenes ΔhydABC with derivatives of pHydcat (16.Gross R. Simon J. Theis F. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the entire hydABC operon and integrates into the genome of W. succinogenes ΔhydABC by homologous recombination (16.Gross R. Simon J. Theis F. Kröger A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Derivatives of pHydcat were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and specifically synthesized oligonucleotides (Table I). Modified pHydcat plasmids were sequenced to confirm the mutations. Nitrate-grown cells of W. succinogenes ΔhydABC were used for transformation as described previously (13.Simon J. Gross R. Einsle O. Kroneck P.M.H. Kröger A. Klimmek O. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 686-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26.Simon J. Gross R. Ringel M. Schmidt E. Kröger A. Eur. J.

Törnroth S. Byrne B. Iwata S. Science. 2002; 295: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). HQNO is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane accepting a hydrogen bond from His-169, which axially ligates the iron atom of the distal heme b group. Further residues of FdnI (Asn-110, Gly-112, Gln-113, Met-172, and Ala-173) situated on transmembrane helices III and IV are in van der Waals contact with the hydroxyquinoline ring of HQNO. Except Gly-112, these residues are conserved in HydC of W. succinogenes NiFe-hydrogenase and other members of the HydC/FdnI family (Table II, see also the model of HydC in Fig. 1). The corresponding residues of HydC were replaced by site-directed modification to determine whether the site of menaquinone reduction on HydC is similar to that proposed for E. coli FdnI. Table III summarizes the properties of the resulting mutants. Mutants N128D, Q131H, and Q131L did not grow by fumarate respiration with H2 as electron donor. The membrane fraction of these mutants grown with formate and fumarate catalyzed benzyl viologen reduction by H2 with wild-type specific activities, whereas the specific activities of reduction of either fumarate or DMN by H2 were drastically inhibited. The heme b groups were present in these variant HydC proteins, and their reduction by H2 was not impaired by the mutations as seen from the wild-type amount of heme b reduced by H2 after the addition of Triton X-100 and fumarate to the membrane fraction of the mutants (Table III). For all three mutants the apparent Km value for DMN was found to be similar to that of the wild type (13 μm). The cell homogenate of the mutants was applied in the H2 → DMN assay for the measurements. Replacement of Met-203 and Ala-204 in W. succinogenes HydC led to mutants that had essentially wild-type properties (Table III).Table IIResidues replaced in W. succinogenes HydCHydC residue (for location see Fig. 1)Corresponding residue in E. coli FdnIaSee Ref. 3 for an alignment of E. coli formate dehydrogenase-N FdnI, W. succinogenes HydC, and similar sequences.Property as derived from the E. coli FdnI crystal structure (6.Jormakka M.

Open table in a new tab Further conserved residues of HydC located near Asn-128 and Gln-131 were replaced, and the resulting mutants were characterized (Tables II and III). Strains G125L, Y127H, Y127F, and P129A grew with H2 and fumarate as energy substrates and showed nearly wild-type specific activities of fumarate or DMN reduction by H2. In contrast, substitution of Tyr-127 by alanine abolished growth with H2 as electron donor, and the specific activity of H2-dependent DMN reduction was inhibited by more than 90% as compared with the wild type. All mutants resembled wild type in heme b reduction by H2 indicating the presence of an intact HydABC complex.The crystal structure of E. coli FdnI suggests the presence of a proton pathway leading from the cytoplasmic membrane surface to the HQNO site. This contains several water molecules maintained by hydrogen bonds to the polar residue Glu-100, located in the loop between helices II and III, and to His-197 near the C terminus (6.Jormakka M. Törnroth S. Byrne B. Iwata S. Science. 2002; 295: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10.Jormakka M. Byrne B. Iwata S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As both residues are not conserved in HydC homologs, variants of W. succinogenes HydC were produced containing modified residues that might be involved in a corresponding proton transfer pathway, namely Asp-88, Glu-94, Asp-100, and the conserved Tyr-114 (Table II). The mutants D88N, E94Q, D100N, and Y114F were, however, not affected in growth by fumarate respiration with H2 as electron donor or in specific electron transport or hydrogenase activity indicating that neither hydroxyl group of the four residues is essential for proton transfer (Table III).The contact of E. coli FdnI and the iron-sulfur subunit FdnH is mediated by a hydrogen bond between the side chains of Tyr-171 in helix IV of FdnI and His-275 of FdnH. The latter residue is situated near the cytoplasmic end of the C-terminal membrane-spanning helix of FdnH. Both residues are strictly conserved within the HydC/FdnI family (Table II). The W. succinogenes mutant having the equivalent Tyr-202 of HydC replaced by phenylalanine showed negligible specific activities of fumarate or DMN reduction but wild-type activity of benzyl viologen reduction by H2 (Table III). Heme b was not reduced by H2 in this mutant, although a wild-type amount of HydC was detected in the membrane fraction by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis (not shown). This suggests that electron transfer from the iron-sulfur subunit HydA to HydC was interrupted in mutant Y202F. Mutant W. succinogenes H305M producing HydA with His-305 (corresponding to His-275 of FdnH) replaced by methionine was found previously to have properties similar to those of mutant Y202F (4.Gross R. Simon J. Lancaster C.R.D. Kröger A. Mol.

The corresponding mutant, W. succinogenes HydC-Strep, showed wild-type properties with respect to growth with H2 and specific hydrogenase activity indicating that the tag affects neither the total amount nor the assembly of the HydABC complex (Table IV).

https://openalex.org/W2076203828,"The initiation of programmed cell death at CD95 (Fas, Apo-1) is achieved by forming a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) at the cytoplasmic membrane surface. Assembly of the DISC has been proposed to occur via homotypic interactions between the death domain (DD) of FADD and the cytoplasmic domain of CD95. Previous analysis of the FADD/CD95 interaction led to the identification of a putative CD95 binding surface within FADD DD formed by alpha helices 2 and 3. More detailed analysis of the CD95/FADD DD interaction now demonstrates that a bimodal surface exists in the FADD DD for interaction with CD95. An expansive surface on one side of the domain is composed of elements in alpha helices 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. This major surface is common to many proteins harboring this motif, whether or not they are associated with programmed cell death. A secondary surface resides on the opposite face of the domain and involves residues in helices 3 and 4. The major surface is topologically similar to the protein interaction surface identified in Drosophila Tube DD and the death effector domain of hamster PEA-15, two physiologically unrelated proteins which interact with structurally unrelated binding partners. These results demonstrate the presence of a structurally conserved surface within the DD which can mediate protein recognition with homo- and heterotypic binding partners, whereas a second surface may be responsible for stabilizing the higher order complex in the DISC."
https://openalex.org/W2020207222,"The sterile α motif (SAM) is a 65-70-amino acid domain found in over 300 proteins that are involved in either signal transduction or transcriptional activation and repression.

Here, we present the solution structure of the SAM domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, Ste50p. Ste50p functions as a modulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades in S. cerevisiae, which control mating, pseudohyphal growth, and osmo-tolerance.

A typical MAPK module consists of three levels of protein kinases, a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) that transduce signals via sequential activation of these kinases by phosphorylation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has five discrete MAPK modules that transduce extracellular stimuli, e.g. mating pheromone, nitrogen starvation, hyperosmolarity, perturbations in cell wall integrity, and signals that control the synthesis of spore walls (1.Banuett F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 249-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mating pheromone response controls conjugation and mating. The pheromone binds to a receptor (Ste2p or Ste3p) and activates a heterotrimeric G protein (Gα, Gpa1p, Gβ, Ste4p, and Gγ, Ste18p). The Gβγ dimer is responsible for transducing the signal to the MAPKKK Ste11p via a path that involves Ste50p, Ste20p (a PKA-related kinase), and Ste5p (a scaffold protein). The MAPKKK Ste11p then phosphorylates the MAPKK Ste7p, which goes on to activate the MAPK, Fus3p (2.Marsh L. Neiman A.M. Herskowitz I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 699-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Activation of the transcription factor Ste12p then leads to the transcription of pheromone inducible genes, e.g. FUS1. Ste50p is thought to be a modulating protein that is found constitutively bound to Ste11p and that functions to sustain and prolong the pheromone-induced signaling response (3.Xu G. Jansen G. Thomas D.Y. Hollenberg C.P. Rad M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The formation of pseudohyphae and invasive growth in response to nitrogen starvation also involves a MAPK cascade involving Ste11p and Ste50p (4.Rad M.R. Jansen G. Buhring F. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Starvation signals are routed through Ras2p, which, acting via Cdc42p (a Rho family small G protein), Ste20p and Ste50p, activates Ste11p. In this cascade the MAPKK is Ste7p, and the MAPK is Kss1p. Kss1p then goes on to activate the Tec1p-Ste12p transcription complex, which in conjunction with Flo8p co-transactivates genes, e.g. FLO11, that are essential for pseudohypha formation. The response to osmotic stress involves two MAPK cascades. The osmosensor Sln1p/Ypdp/Ssk1p activates the MAPKKKs Ssk2p and Ssk22p that activate the MAPKK Pbs2p and finally the MAPK Hog1p. The Sho1p osmosensor on the other hand activates Ste11p with the cooperation of Ste50p, which then activates Pbs2p and Hog1p. Thus, Pbs2p/Hog1p can be activated independently by two separate osmotic sensors. Although Ste50p was originally identified as a modulator of the pheromone response pathway in S. cerevisiae (5.Rad M.R. Xu G. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 236: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it has since been shown to have only a moderate effect on mating. It has, however, been demonstrated that Ste50p is absolutely required for the Sho1p/Ste11p control of the HOG (high osmolarity glycerol) pathway and that Ste50p may be an integral part of the Ste11p MAPKKK (6.Posas F. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5788-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The interaction between Ste50p and Ste11p is mediated by the N-terminal regions of these proteins (6.Posas F. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5788-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), each of which includes a sterile α motif (SAM) domain. The SAM domain was first identified as a 65-70-residue domain found in 14 proteins including Ste50p, Ste11p, and their Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologues, Ste4 and Byr2 (7.Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Refined searches identified 60 further SAM domain-containing proteins (8.Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) including the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases. SAM domains are now known to exist in over 300 proteins. The protein set that contains SAM domains suggested that the SAM domain is a conserved protein-protein interaction domain found in proteins involved in development and signal transduction. Extensive work on many SAM-containing proteins has shown that the SAM domains do indeed mediate homodimerization and heterodimerization. Proteins known to dimerize through SAM domain interactions now include not only receptors such as the Eph family but also many transcription factors, e.g. the Ets family (9.Slupsky C.M. Gentile L.N. Donaldson L.W. Mackereth C.D. Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12129-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), where the domain is known as the pointed (Pnt) domain, the polyhomeotic proteins, and the p63/p73 members of the p53 family of tumor suppressor proteins (10.Thanos C.D. Bowie J.U. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1708-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SAM domains have also been shown to bind other non-SAM proteins and protein motifs, e.g. protein-tyrosine phosphatases (11.Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23588-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ste11p appears to be under complex regulatory control. The protein has an N-terminal SAM domain (residues 14-86) that binds to the Ste50p SAM domain (residues 27-109). Residues 133-335 of Ste11p have two different functions: to negatively regulate the C-terminal kinase domain and to mediate the interaction between Ste11p and Ste5p (15.Wu C.L. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Binding of Ste50p SAM to the Ste11p SAM appears to alleviate the negative intramolecular regulation of residues 133-335 on the Ste11p kinase domain. It is tempting to speculate that binding of the SAM domain induces structural changes in the regulatory domain of Ste11p allowing activation of the kinase domain. However, it appears that Ste11p and Ste50p are constitutively bound in vivo, so binding per se, although necessary for activation of Ste11p, is not sufficient (15.Wu C.L. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In fact, it seems that a C-terminal region of Ste50p is also required for a productive interaction with Ste11p. Although this C-terminal region has no identifiable domains, it is notable that it has a high degree of homology to the C-terminal region of its homologue in S. pombe Ste4. This region in Ste4 is also required for correct function (16.Tu H. Barr M. Dong D.L. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5876-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It seems that Ste11p undergoes different levels of regulation in the distinct pathways in which it is involved. In the HOG pathway Ste50p is absolutely required and is sufficient to activate Ste11p. However, in the mating response where Ste50p is important but not essential, activation of Ste11p requires interactions with both Ste50p and Ste5p (15.Wu C.L. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2425-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

The self-association of the Ste50p SAM domain has been investigated using analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration, which show that the domain from Ste50p is monomeric; this is supported by the NMR data. The SAM domain from the S. cerevisiae MAPKKK Ste11p by contrast is shown to be dimeric. The Ste50p SAM domain is shown to bind to the Ste11p SAM domain in an in vitro assay, and two separate mutations in the Ste50p SAM domain were found that inhibit this interaction. We examine these results in light of the proposed function of the Ste50p SAM domain as a hetero-oligomerization motif. Protein Expression and Purification—The SAM domains from Ste50p (residues 27-108) and Ste11p (residues 14-86) were amplified by PCR from a preparation of genomic yeast DNA. Restriction enzyme sites were added into the PCR primers used to facilitate cloning into expression vectors. Primer sequences used were: Ste11p SAM, 5′-CCGGGATCCCATATGGGTGACGAAAAGACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTCACCGTTTATCTCTCTG-3′ (reverse); and Ste50p SAM, 5′-CCGGGATCCCATATGAATAATGAAGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCGGATCCTCAGTCCTTCCACTCCAA-3′ (reverse). Bold type indicates restriction endonuclease sites. Ste50p SAM and STE11p SAM were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) as GST fusion proteins using the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) and purified using glutathione agarose (Sigma) by standard protocols (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were either used directly for pull-down assays or cleaved with thrombin restriction protease (Merck). Unlabeled and labeled SAM domain samples were prepared by growing the E. coli cells in 2TY or MOPS medium supplemented with 5% Celtone (Spectra Stable Isotopes), respectively. The SAM domains were then purified by size exclusion chromatography (16/60 S75; Amersham Biosciences). The protein samples for NMR spectroscopy consisted of ∼1.0 mm protein in 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% D2O, 0.05% NaN3, pH 6.0. A mixed labeled sample of Ste50p SAM was generated by mixing a 1:1 ratio of unlabeled: 13C,15N-labeled protein and adding 8 m guanidine hydrochloride to a final concentration of 6 m. The protein was then refolded by rapid dilution (50-fold) into NMR buffer and subjected to size exclusion chromatography to remove the residual guanidine hydrochloride. The sample was then concentrated to 500 μl (∼1 mm protein) for NMR. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were recorded at 35 °C on Bruker DRX spectrometers operating at 500 and 800 MHz, equipped with H/C/N triple resonance probes with actively shielded z-gradients. 15N HSQC along with three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, H(CC)(CO)NH, (H)CC(CO)NH, and HCCH total correlation spectroscopy were recorded at 500 MHz; a 13C-separated NOESY was recorded at 800 MHz. The data were processed and analyzed using the programs AZARA (v2.7, Wayne Boucher and Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge) and ANSIG (24.Kraulis P.J. Domaille P.J. Campbellburk S.L. Vanaken T. Laue E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3515-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional HNHA experiment was recorded to measure 3JHN-Hα coupling constants. Structure Calculation—The Ste50p SAM domain structures were calculated iteratively using the programs ARIA 1.2 (25.Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and CNS 1.0 (26.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Eight iterations were calculated, with 20 structures/iteration, of which seven were used for analysis of the ambiguous restraints. Finally, 100 structures were calculated, and the 25 with the lowest energy were selected for further analysis. Backbone ϕ angle restraints were obtained from an HNHA experiment. Backbone torsion angles were calculated from the backbone chemical shifts using the program TALOS (27.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and included as loose restraints with errors of ±30° or twice the standard deviation, whichever was greater. Ste11p SAM-Ste50p SAM Titration—A titration was performed by adding aliquots of unlabeled Ste50p SAM domain to 500 μl of 0.65 mm15N-labeled Ste11p SAM and then concentrating the sample back to 500 μl. Ste50p SAM was added in 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 molar equivalents. An 15N HSQC and size exclusion chromatography were run at each titration point. Analytical gel filtration was performed on a SMART system using a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). A similar titration was performed by adding aliquots of unlabeled Ste11p SAM to 550 μl of 0.3 mm15N-labeled Ste50p SAM and then concentrating the sample back to 550 μl. Unlabeled Ste11p SAM was added in 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and ≈11 molar equivalents. 15N HSQC and TROSY (28.Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar) experiments were run at each titration point. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. For both Ste11p SAM and Ste50p SAM, three samples were run simultaneously, with protein concentrations of 1, 2, and 3 mg/ml, respectively. The protein samples were 90 μl with 100 μl of reference buffer in the second sector of the two sector cells. The buffer used was identical to that used for the NMR experiments. All of the experiments were run at 4 °C. The data were collected at equilibrium for three different angular velocities: 25,000, 30,000, and 35,000 rpm. Detection was performed both by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and by using the Rayleigh interference optics. Because of problems arising from the differential oxidation of dithiothreitol in the sample and reference cells, all of the data analysis reported uses interference data. Data analysis was performed using WinNonlin (29.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the pGEX-2T Ste50p SAM expression construct encoding residues 27-108 was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the Ste50p SAM coding region of all mutants was verified using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). GST Pull-down Assays—To ensure that the concentration of the GST-SAM fusion was sufficiently high on the beads, 3 ml of 50% glutathione agarose bead slurry was used to clear the fusion protein from 1 liter of culture cell extract. The fusion proteins were not digested with thrombin; instead the beads were washed a further three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton. The concentration of the free STE11 and STE50 SAM domains was adjusted to 0.4 mm. The concentration of the immobilized GST-SAM domains was estimated visually from the strength of the bands on the SDS-PAGE gels to be at least equal to that of protein free in solution. 100 μl of 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads with a GST-SAM fusion protein bound was added to a microcentrifuge tube. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. 50 μl of free SAM domain solution was added to the bead pellet, and the bead slurry was then incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation as above. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The samples of the beads, and the supernatant were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). Structure Determination—Backbone resonances were assigned using standard three-dimensional HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments. The spectra recorded were of sufficient quality to achieve a complete backbone assignment for all residues (27-108), with the exception of Val-66 and Leu-75, whose backbone amide resonances were missing. Side chain assignments were made using three-dimensional H(CC)(CO)NNH and (H)CC(CO)NNH experiments, along with a three-dimensional HCCH total correlation spectroscopy. The side chain assignment was completed for the same range of residues. Analysis of the 15N- and 13C-separated NOESY spectra generated a total of 1,498 unambiguous and 791 ambiguous distance restraints. These were translated by ARIA into 1,013 unambiguous and 566 ambiguous, nondegenerate restraints. The final number of restraints, after eight ARIA iterations, was 1,354 unambiguous and 304 ambiguous (Table I). Assignment of the HNHA spectrum provided 35 torsion angle restraints, whereas analysis of the chemical shifts using the TALOS program gave a further 108 torsion angle restraints. The latter restraints were used loosely and discarded if in conflict with restraints provided by the HNHA. In the case of the HNHA, the torsion angles were set to ϕ = -120 ± 20° for 3JNH-Hα > 8.0 Hz and ϕ = -57 ± 20° for 3JNH-Hα < 6.0 Hz.Table IExperimental restraints and structural statisticsNumber of experimental restraintsUnambiguous1354Ambiguous304Dihedral restraints137〈SA〉a〈SA〉cbCoordinate precisionRMS deviations of backbone atoms (31-100) (Å)0.53 ± 0.110.36RMS deviations of all heavy atoms (31-100) (Å)0.98 ± 0.080.83RMS deviationsFrom the experimental restraintsNuclear Overhauser effect distances (Å)0.009 ± 0.0020.007Talos dihedral angles (°)0.572 ± 0.1110.585From idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.0013 ± 0.000070.0016Angles (°)0.312 ± 0.0080.306Impropers (°)0.180 ± 0.0130.176Final energyElj (kJ/mol)aThe Lennard-Jones potential was not used at any stage in the refinement.−734.321 ± 9.39−722.799Ramachandran analysis (%)Residues in most favored regions74.377.2Residues in additionally allowed regions23.822.8Residues in generously allowed regions1.40.0Residues in disallowed regions0.50.0a The Lennard-Jones potential was not used at any stage in the refinement. Open table in a new tab No long range nuclear Overhauser effects were observed for residues 27-31 and 100-108, and the line widths for these resonances were considerably narrower than those in the remainder of the domain. These residues are therefore not structured and have been omitted from all figures and the structural statistics. The structure of residues 31-100 is well ordered and has good covalent geometry (Fig. 1 and Table I). There were no distance restraints violated by more than 0.1 Å and no dihedral restraints violated by greater than 5°. Ste50p SAM Domain Structure—The Ste50p SAM consists of six helices, which form a compact, globular fold (Figs. 1 and 2). The N terminus forms a single turn of 310 helix from residues 32-34 (helix A′). This leads into two short α-helices, residues 37-46 (helix A) and 55-62 (helix B), followed by another 310 helix between residues 67 and 72 (helix C). Helix C is followed by another short α-helix at residues 75-81 (helix D), and the domain ends with a long C-terminal α-helix comprising residues 86-101 (helix E). Helices A and B form an anti-parallel helical hairpin on one side of a helical bundle. The other side of the bundle is made up of helix E, which packs against helices C and D in an anti-parallel manner, with one half of the coil being made up of helices C and D, interrupted by the loop. The two sides of the bundle are approximately orthogonal. The first helix, helix A′, is at the bottom of the bundle and packs in an anti-parallel fashion against the N-terminal half of helix C. The Ste50p SAM Domain Is a Monomer in Solution—Because other SAM domains are known to form homodimers or higher order oligomers, we examined the Ste50p SAM domain for any evidence of homotypic interaction. NMR can be used to solve the structures of homodimers if a sample can be produced that contains a 1:1 mixture of monomer with different labeling patterns. We produced such a sample of Ste50p SAM, in which 6 m guanidine hydrochloride was used as a denaturant prior to mixing unlabeled and 13C,15N-labeled proteins. The mixture was refolded by rapid dilution, and two NMR experiments were recorded to look for intermolecular interactions: a 13C-separated, 13C-rejected NOESY experiment and a 13C-separated NOESY recorded without carbon decoupling in the indirect proton dimension. In neither experiment was there any evidence for intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects, suggesting that the Ste50p SAM domain is monomeric. To exclude the possibility that the absence of intermolecular contacts was due to low sensitivity in the NMR experiments, we then sought to confirm this result by other means. Given that the Kd values published for other SAM domain homo-oligomers were relatively high (in the region of 0.5-5 mm), we performed analytical ultracentrifugation using samples of the Ste50p SAM domain at concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg/ml (∼0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mm, respectively). The sedimentation equilibrium data for the Ste50p SAM domain are shown in Fig. 3b, and the goodness of fit to a monomeric model for the data sets is shown in Fig. 3a. As can be seen the majority of the residuals are randomly distributed at approximately 0, but there is a slight upward trend at higher values of the radius, r. This is diagnostic of an aggregating protein, although given that this upward trend is restricted to the faster rotor speeds with the highest protein concentrations, it is likely to be a very small effect. The data are consistent with a molecular mass of 11.0 kDa for the Ste50p SAM domain. The Ste50p SAM domain is calculated to have a mass of 10.0 kDa. The highest concentration of the Ste50p SAM used was 0.3 mm; thus the dissociation constant for dimer formation would be above 4.9 mm. These data substantiate the monomer structure solved by NMR. The SAM Domain of Ste11p Self-associates in Solution—Because Ste50p and Ste11p interact via their SAM domains in vivo, we investigated whether the Ste11p SAM domain could self-associate. Three samples of the protein were prepared at concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg/ml (∼0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mm, respectively) for analytical ultracentrifugation. The data obtained (Fig. 4b) were fitted to an equation describing the behavior of a single ideal species. The calculated molecular mass of the domain is 8687 Da. The molecular mass obtained from the calculation was 12.75 kDa, which exceeds the actual mass by more than 40%. In addition, the model only described the data poorly as judged by the pattern of the residuals. Fitting to a monomer to dimer equilibrium still produced a poor fit. However, simultaneous fitting of the Ka and the second virial co-efficient gave residuals that distribute well at approximately 0 (Fig. 4a). The values obtained in fringe units were lnKa = -2.00 and B = -6.4 × 10-3. Using an approximate conversion factor of 3.3 fringes (g/l) this gives an estimated Kd of 0.5 mm. The Ste50p SAM Domain Interacts with the Ste11p SAM Domain in Vitro—GST pull-down experiments were used to test the ability of Ste11p and Ste50p SAM domains to interact homotypically and heterotypically in vitro (Fig. 5). Ste50p SAM domain does not self-associate, in agreement with all the previous data (lanes 11 and 12). Addition of free Ste11p SAM to immobilized Ste50p SAM (lanes 9 and 10) shows that these two SAM domains can interact with each other. The reciprocal experiment, where Ste11p is immobilized on beads, was also performed. When free Ste50p SAM was added, an interaction between the two SAM domains was again visible (lanes 5 and 6). In addition, free Ste11p SAM was added to immobilized Ste11p SAM (lanes 7 and 8). Despite the apparent decrease in the amount of input Ste11p, it can still be seen that free Ste11p SAM can self-associate with the immobilized Ste11p, thus confirming the dimerization of Ste11p observed by analytical ultracentrifugation. It should be noted that although GST fusion proteins are known to be dimers, using the SAM domains as GST fusion proteins in these assays does not appear to hamper their abilities to homo- or heterodimerize. Analysis of the Oligomerization State of the Ste50p SAM-Ste11p SAM Complex—In an attempt to analyze the Ste11p SAM-Ste50p SAM interaction by NMR, unlabeled Ste11p SAM was titrated into 15N-labeled Ste50p SAM, and the changes in the 15N HSQC and 15N TROSY spectra were monitored (data not shown). The peaks became very broad during the titration in the HSQC spectra, with most disappearing completely during the course of the titration. A few new peaks appeared that were also very broad and weak. Interestingly, the broadening was mirrored in the TROSY spectra, indicating that it was not due to an in"

Rapamycin has also been a useful tool for studying signaling mechanisms regulating cellular proliferation. However, the effects of rapamycin remain poorly understood, and the precise mechanisms of clinical action remain elusive. Previously, we found that, depending on the strength of the signal delivered to the T cell via both the T cell receptor and the costimulatory molecule CD28, CD8+ T cells are capable of rapamycin-resistant proliferation. Here, we have further elucidated the mechanism of rapamycin-resistant proliferation of human CD8+ T cells. Under conditions where rapamycin inhibited proliferation, p27kip1 down-regulation was prevented, whereas under conditions resulting in rapamycin-resistant proliferation, p27kip1 was down-regulated. Further, T cell receptor/CD28-dependent induction of bcl-xL expression was not inhibited by rapamycin, which correlated with both rapamycin-resistant proliferation and increased cell survival. Moreover, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity was able to eliminate rapamycin-resistant proliferation of freshly isolated CD8+ human cells, strongly suggesting that phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity was required for the rapamycin-resistant proliferation of CD8+ T cells. The selective immunosuppressive effect of rapamycin in human CD8+ T cell populations could be predictive of a selective effect allowing cytotoxic responses during microbial infections where there are strong strengths of signals associated with high affinity T cell receptors and strong costimulatory second signals. In contrast, the weaker autoimmune and perhaps allogeneic responses can be selectively inhibited by the actions of rapamycin. Rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of many mammalian cell types, including lymphocytes, making the compound useful as an immunosuppressant. Rapamycin has also been a useful tool for studying signaling mechanisms regulating cellular proliferation.

In contrast, the weaker autoimmune and perhaps allogeneic responses can be selectively inhibited by the actions of rapamycin. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant that functions by inhibiting entry into the cell cycle. This inhibition of proliferation by rapamycin occurs at a later stage of cellular activation than the inhibition by cyclosporin A and FK506, which inhibit calcineurin or calcineurin-dependent transcriptional activation of lymphokine genes (Ref. 1.Fruman D.A.

Su Q. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The potent immunosuppressive activity of rapamycin has led to its wide clinical use in solid organ transplantation (reviewed in Ref. 4.Saunders R.N. Metcalfe M.S. Nicholson M.L. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).

However, the clinical mechanism of action of rapamycin in suppressing immune responses is not well defined. Although it is clear that entry into the cell cycle is generally inhibited by rapamycin, we recently made the surprising observation that increasing the strength of signal delivered to the T cell via both the T cell receptor (TcR) and the costimulatory molecule CD28 allowed subpopulations of CD8+ T cells to proliferate in the presence of rapamycin (6.Slavik J.M. Lim D.G. Burakoff S.J. Hafler D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3201-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In fact, CD8+ T cells isolated and stimulated ex vivo often exhibited increases in [3H]thymidine uptake following exposure to rapamycin in vitro. The rapamycin-resistant proliferation was not dependent on p70s6k activation, and the mobility shift that corresponds to phosphorylation of p70s6k was inhibited even under conditions resulting in rapamycin-resistant proliferation. However, the antigen-driven, rapamycin-resistant proliferation of a T cell clone could be converted to rapamycin-sensitive in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies. These observations in both antigen-reactive CD8+ T cell clones and CD8+ T cells isolated ex vivo provide a novel model for studying the intracellular mechanism of action of rapamycin, about which a great deal is known. The inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by the FKBP12/rapamycin complex halts cell cycle progression at the G1-S transition. mTOR activity appears to be upstream of several pathways involved in regulating progression through the cell cycle, including p70s6k (7.Calvo V.

Both p70s6k and 4EBP are involved in regulating translation via different mechanisms. p70s6k phosphorylates the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and thereby controls synthesis of a subset of proteins, whereas 4EBP is the suppressor of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and thereby regulates many proteins involved in the cell cycle. Phosphorylation of p70s6k by mTOR is thought to promote its activity, and phosphorylation of 4EBP reduces its affinity for 4E, releasing its blockade of translation. mTOR has been shown to phosphorylate specific residues on both 4EBP and p70s6k (12.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). An emerging concept in the regulation of immune responses relates to the strength of signal delivered to the T cell. This occurs with formation of an immune synapse between the antigen-presenting cell and the T cell and depends on both the antigen-specific interaction and critical contributions of co-receptors (14.Monks C.R.F. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar, 15.Gakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential effects of rapamycin on CD8+ T cell entry into the cell cycle, as related to the integrated strength of signal delivered through the immune synapse, are likely to have an important influence on the cellular mechanism of action of the drug. Here, we examined the biochemical relationship between the strength of signal delivered through the immune synapse and the proliferation of CD8+ T cells in the presence of rapamycin. We found that p27kip1 down-regulation, unlike p70s6k phosphorylation, correlated with rapamycin-resistant proliferation of both a human CD8+ T cell clone and freshly isolated human CD8+ T cells. Further, CD3/CD28-dependent induction of bcl-xL expression was not inhibited by rapamycin treatment, and this correlated with [3H]thymidine incorporation. Finally, using a panel of inhibitors of specific signaling pathways, we discovered that a PI3K inhibitor was able to eliminate rapamycin-resistant proliferation. Under these conditions, p27kip down-regulation was blocked and bcl-xL expression was not induced. Therefore, rapamycin-resistant proliferation of CD8+ human peripheral blood T cells requires PI3K activity and is accompanied by both p27kip1 down-regulation and bcl-xL induction. Thus, the down-regulation of p27kip1 in association with bcl-xL induction correlates with the escape of human CD8+ T cells from rapamycin inhibition, and suggests novel methods of immune monitoring in patients undergoing rapamycin therapy. Cells and Cell Culture—Lymphocytes were isolated from the whole blood of normal donors after platelet phoresis by centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and plastic adherence. CD8+ T cells were positively selected following incubation with anti-human CD8 microbeads using the Dynabead magnetic cell separation system (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY). Purified CD8+ T cells were rested overnight at 37 °C before use. CD8+ T cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Biowhittaker) (termed complete RPMI). CD8+ human T cell clones reactive to human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I peptide Tax11–19 were generated as described; they have been extensively characterized functionally elsewhere (6.Slavik J.M.

For use in experiments, T cell clones were thawed, restimulated with phytohemagglutinin plus irradiated mononuclear cells, and expanded in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated pooled human serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA), 10% T-stim (Collaborative Biomedicine Products, Bedford, MA), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Biowhittaker). Proliferation Assay—Cells were pretreated with rapamycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA) or ethanol (vehicle control) for 30 min to 2 h before they were used in proliferation assays. Plates were coated with anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml, murine anti-human CD3 mAb OKT3 (ATCC)), or with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml, murine anti-human CD28 mAb 3D10), as indicated, at 37 °C for at least 2 h and then washed five times with two volumes of PBS to remove free antibody prior to use. T cells were plated in 96-well round-bottom plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 105/well (in triplicate) in a final volume of 200 μl and cultured for 3–5 days as indicated. Where indicated, LY294002 (5–10 μm) was included in cultures (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). Proliferation was assessed by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), after harvest (Tomtec, Orange, CT) following an 18-h pulse. Incorporation was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallace, Gaithersburg, MD). Western Blots—Human purified CD8+ T cells or CD8+ T cell clones were cultured in the presence or absence of rapamycin for the time period indicated, in 24-well plates coated with either anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with cold RPMI containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and either frozen in liquid nitrogen or processed immediately. Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Detergent extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were harvested and separated by electrophoresis through SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) (Protogel, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc, anti-p27kip1, anti-BclxL/s, anti-p70s6k (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cyclin D2 or anti-cyclin D3 (Neomarkers, Freemont, CA), as indicated, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Where indicated, blots were stripped (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), reblocked, and reprobed with antibody. Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate, Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) Labeling— Cells were labeled with CFSE following the protocol of Lyons (17.Lyons A.B. Parish C.R. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 171: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 2 × 107/ml. An equal volume of 0.25 μm CFSE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added, and cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with intermittent mixing. After 5 min, an equal volume of heat-inactivated FCS was added and cells were incubated an additional 1 min at room temperature, spun down, and washed three times with complete RPMI. Cells were plated at a concentration of no more than 1 × 106/ml and stimulated as indicated. After stimulation, cells were harvested, spun down, and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting medium (PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated FCS). Samples were run on a Becton Dickinson FACScan, and data were analyzed using Cellquest. Annexin V Staining—Human purified CD8+ T cells were cultured in the presence or absence of rapamycin in 48-well plates coated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and labeled with annexin V-FITC, propidium iodide, or both using an Apoptosis Detection Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature in 100 μl of binding buffer containing the appropriate labeling reagent, followed by the addition of 400 μl of binding buffer. Samples were run on a FACScan, and data were analyzed using Cellquest. CD8+ T Lymphocytes Undergo Cell Division despite the Presence of Rapamycin—Proliferation of CD8+ T cells and a subset of CD8+ T cell clones induced by higher concentrations of plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb plus anti-CD28 mAb (or a high concentration of anti-CD3 alone for clones) was resistant to inhibition by rapamycin (6.Slavik J.M. Lim D.G. Burakoff S.J. Hafler D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3201-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Given that CD8+ T cell clonal expansion ex vivo as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation after co-cross-linked anti-CD3 (10 or 50 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) was partially blocked by rapamycin, and that only a subset of the clones tested exhibited rapamycin-resistant proliferation, it was possible that only a subset of circulating T cells were resistant to the effects of rapamycin. To validate the results of the thymidine incorporation assay, we used a second method to confirm rapamycin-resistant proliferation of the CD8+ T cells. T cells were labeled with CFSE. CFSE is incorporated into the cell, where it irreversibly couples to both intracellular and cell surface proteins. As the labeled cell divides, the CFSE is evenly divided among the daughter cells such that each generation has half the fluorescent intensity of the parent; this can be readily assessed using flow cytometry (17.Lyons A.B. Parish C.R. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 171: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Using this technique, we compared the proliferating population of CD8+ T cells in the presence and absence of rapamycin. CD8+ T cells were labeled with CFSE and cultured for 5 days in uncoated or anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated plates in the presence or absence of 1 μm rapamycin (Fig. 1A). On day 5, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. Unlabeled cells (Fig. 1A, dashed line) appear as the histogram closest to the origin. Labeled but unstimulated cells (Fig. 1A, dotted line) are represented as a single, prominent peak farthest from the origin. Cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Fig. 1A, solid thin line) have undergone cell division, and now appear as two distinct populations, one with half the mean fluorescence intensity of the original. Treatment with rapamycin did not prevent this cell division, as stimulated cells underwent at least as many divisions in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 1A, heavy solid line). Cells were assigned to one of three categories on the basis of the number of cell divisions they had undergone (0, 1, or at least 2). Fig. 1B shows the results from five experiments, where the percentage of total live cells that fall into each of three categories is shown. There is no statistically significant difference between control and rapamycin-treated stimulated cells with respect to the number of cells in each category. These results confirm that the [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence of rapamycin represents cell division and proliferation and is not cased by an artifact inherent to the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Rapamycin-resistant Proliferation Correlates with p27kip1 Down-regulation in Response to Stimulation—Several pathways, and specific proteins in these pathways, involved in progression through the cell cycle that are induced in response to stimulation are affected by rapamycin. By example, rapamycin has been shown to inhibit the induction of c-Myc expression in response to stimulation in cells that are sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin (18.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence John C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Conversely, rapamycin resistance in tumor cell lines has been shown to correlate with the inability of the drug to inhibit the induction of c-Myc (18.Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence John C. Houghton P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Given this, we examined the induction of c-Myc expression in freshly isolated CD8+ human T cells after stimulation under rapamycin-resistant conditions. Freshly isolated human CD8+ T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence or absence of rapamycin (Fig. 2A). Although c-Myc was absent in unstimulated cells, it was induced upon stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, and this expression was not prevented by treatment with rapamycin (Fig. 2A). Thus, in freshly isolated human CD8+ T cells, rapamycin did not inhibit c-Myc induction under conditions leading to rapamycin-resistant proliferation. p27kip1 is a negative regulator of the cell cycle, which is normally down-regulated in response to cytokines or growth factors, permitting cell cycle progression (19.Pavletich N.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Thus, a diminution of p27kip1 levels is seen following proliferative stimulation; conversely, non-proliferating cells have high basal levels of p27kip1. IL-2 is capable of providing such a signal, and exposure to IL-2 can promote the down-regulation of p27kip1, thereby enabling cell division (9.Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Rapamycin has been shown to prevent the down-regulation of p27kip1 (9.Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 20.Kawamata S. Sakaida H. Hori T. Uchiyama T. Blood. 1998; 91: 561-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and rapamycin resistance in murine cells was associated with the loss of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 (21.Luo Y. Marx S.O. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Massague J. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Given these results, we examined the expression of p27kip1 in human CD8+ T cell clones in response to stimulation in the presence or absence of rapamycin. The human CD8+ T cell clone TP7 was pretreated with either vehicle control or 1 μm rapamycin and then exposed to plate-bound anti-CD3. Base-line expression of p27kip1 is evident in the unstimulated samples at both the 15- and 24-h time points (Fig. 2B). However, after these cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 for either 15 or 24 h, p27kip1 levels diminished (Fig. 2B). Notably, treatment with rapamycin did not change the level of down-regulation relative to untreated, stimulated T cells. Correlation of the entry into the cell cycle with p27kip1 expression was verified by the results of a thymidine incorporation assay set up simultaneously (Fig. 2C). Proliferation induced by 1 or 5 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb was not inhibited by the presence of rapamycin at concentrations as high as 500 nm (Fig. 2C). It was important to confirm these results in freshly isolated human CD8+ peripheral blood T cells. As with the T cell clone, robust base-line expression of p27kip1 was evident at both 24- and 48-h time points (Fig. 2D). Stimulation with anti-CD3 alone for 24 h resulted in a slight diminution of p27kip1 expression; this diminution was more obvious when cells were stimulated with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. At both time points, the expression of p27kip1 was dramatically decreased after CD3/CD28 stimulation as compared with expression in unstimulated cells. In both instances, this down-regulation was not affected by the addition of 1 μm rapamycin. However, the difference in the levels of p27kip1 in the unstimulated versus the stimulated cells was maximal at 48 h (Fig. 2D); therefore, further experiments examining p27kip1 expression were carried out at 48-h time points. The down-regulation of p27kip1 correlated well with the proliferation results from the same experiment (Fig. 2E). Consistent with our previous results (6.Slavik J.M. Lim D.G. Burakoff S.J. Hafler D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3201-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), [3H]thymidine incorporation was induced by stimulation with anti-CD3 alone (Fig. 2E and inset); this proliferation was readily inhibited by either a minimal dose of 1 nm or a maximal dose of 1 μm rapamycin (Fig. 2E, inset). However, the proliferation induced by the combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 was resistant to both 1 nm and 1 μm rapamycin. Therefore, because the effects were the same, we used 100 nm, 0.5 μm, or 1 μm rapamycin throughout this report. Thus, we found that, in contrast to p70s6k activation, levels of p27kip1 correlated with the functional proliferative phenotype. Expression of Cyclin D Can Be Induced in CD8+ T Cells in the Presence of Rapamycin—Another level at which progression through cell cycle is regulated is the timing of expression of the cyclins, the regulatory component of the cyclin-dependent kinases (reviewed in Refs. 22.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar and 23.Olashaw, N., and Pledger, W. J. (2002) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2002/134/re7Google Scholar). The D-type cyclins appear to be involved early on in the response to incoming mitogenic signals. There are three cyclin D family proteins, cyclins D1, D2, and D3. The effect of rapamycin on cyclin D1 is somewhat controversial; some have shown expression of cyclin D1 to be affected by rapamycin in fibroblasts and hepatocytes (24.Nelsen C.J. Rickheim D.G.

Fukui Y. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1346-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Regardless, because T cells do not express cyclin D1 (27.Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the induction of the cyclins D2 and D3 is a possible target of the anti-proliferative effects of rapamycin (3.Dumont F.J. Su Q. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28.Turner J.M. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Given these previous data and our p27kip1 data described herein, we undertook a kinetic study of the effects of rapamycin on specific proteins involved in the progression through cell cycle in CD8+ T cells. CD8+ human peripheral blood T cells were left unstimulated, or were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28, in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm rapamycin for the time periods indicated. Following stimulation, cells were collected and lysed and proteins separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to PVDF, which was separated into two halves; the top and bottom halves were immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc and anti-cyclin D2, respectively (Fig. 3A, top and middle panels). Stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 resulted in the detection of cyclin D2 protein, which peaked between 7 and 16 h (data not shown and Fig. 3A). D2 protein expression was still evident at 24 h but was often undetectable by 48 h. c-Myc expression followed a similar time course, with expression evident by 7.5 h (data not shown and Fig. 2A), continued expression at 16 and 24 h and no expression by 48 h (Fig. 3A). The expression of these proteins was unaffected by the presence of rapamycin. In contrast, when the bottom half of the membrane was reprobed with anti-cyclin D3, there was a dramatic shift in the time course of expression upon exposure to rapamycin (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). In stimulated T cells, cyclin D3 expression was evident at 16 h, maximal at 24 h, and undetectable by 48 h. When the cells were treated with rapamycin, the kinetics of expression appeared to be shifted, with expression first detectable at 24 h that was maximal by 48 h and gone by 72 h. There was variability in these experiments with respect to cyclin D2 expression at early time points; a graphic summary of these results is shown in Fig. 3B. That is, at earlier time points (8 h or less), cyclin D2 expression was variably inhibited by rapamycin; at 24 h, rapamycin failed to inhibit cyclin D2 expression in most experiments, whereas by 48 h or later, rapamycin did not inhibit the expression of cyclin D2 when it was still evident. Cyclin D3 expression was consistently inhibited (though not abrogated) by rapamycin at the early time points examined. Thus, although rapamycin may delay the expression of cyclin D2 and D3 in human CD8+ T cells, it does not block the induction of cyclin D expression, a finding consistent with our proliferation results. Rapamycin Exposure Increases the Number of Live CD8+ T Cells upon Stimulation with Anti-CD3 and Anti-CD28 —We observed that the proliferation of rapamycin-treated CD8+ T cells (as measured by either thymidine incorporat"

As shown recently, Archaea of the genus Methanosarcina contain both group I (GroEL/GroES) and group II (thermosome) chaperonins in the cytosol. Here we report on a detailed functional analysis of the archaeal GroEL/GroES system of Methanosarcina mazei (Mm) in comparison to its bacterial counterpart from Escherichia coli (Ec). We find that the groESgroEL operon of M. mazei is unable to functionally replace groESgroEL in E. coli. However, the MmGroES protein can largely complement a mutant EcGroES protein in vivo. The ATPase rate of MmGroEL is very low and the dissociation of MmGroES from MmGroEL is 15 times slower than for the EcGroEL/GroES system. This slow ATPase cycle results in a prolonged enclosure time for model substrate proteins, such as rhodanese, in the MmGroEL:GroES folding cage before their release into the medium. Interestingly, optimal functionality of MmGroEL/GroES and its ability to encapsulate larger proteins, such as malate dehydrogenase, requires the presence of ammonium sulfate in vitro. In the absence of ammonium sulfate, malate dehydrogenase fails to be encapsulated by GroES and rather cycles on and off the GroEL trans ring in a non-productive reaction. These results indicate that the archaeal GroEL/GroES system has preserved the basic encapsulation mechanism of bacterial GroEL and suggest that it has adjusted the length of its reaction cycle to the slower growth rates of Archaea. Additionally, the release of only the folded protein from the GroEL/GroES cage may prevent adverse interactions of the GroEL substrates with the thermosome, which is not normally located within the same compartment.

In contrast to other types of molecular chaperones that act more generally in de novo folding, such as the Hsp70s, the chaperonins form large cylindrical double-ring structures in which a single molecule of unfolded protein is transiently enclosed and allowed to fold unimpaired by aggregation. The chaperonins have been divided into two distinct classes, group I and group II, with members of both groups exhibiting only limited sequence homology but an overall similar architecture of the oligomeric ring complexes (8.Frydman J.

Group I chaperonins, also known as Hsp60s or Cpn60s, are generally found in the bacterial cytosol (e.g. GroEL in Escherichia coli) as well as in mitochondria (mtHsp60) and chloroplasts (Rubisco 1The abbreviations used are: Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; AS, ammonium sulfate; CDTA, trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; Ec, Escherichia coli; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; Mm, Methanosarcina mazei; NTA, nitrilotriacetate; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane-sulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. subunit binding protein), and typically form homo-oligomeric complexes of two stacked heptameric rings. They cooperate functionally with cofactors of the Hsp10 (GroES) family, single heptameric rings of ∼10-kDa subunits that bind to the ends of the Hsp60 cylinder. GroEL of E. coli and its cofactor GroES have been extensively analyzed in terms of their structure and function. GroEL is composed of 14 identical 57-kDa subunits. Each subunit consists of three domains: the equatorial domain contains the ATP binding site and mediates most intersubunit contacts within and between rings. It is connected via an intermediate hinge-like domain to the apical domain. The apical domains expose a number of hydrophobic residues toward the ring cavity for the binding of unfolded protein substrate and provide binding regions for flexible sequence loops on the subunits of GroES. The ATP-dependent interactions of GroEL with protein substrate and GroES have been studied extensively (reviewed in Refs. 2.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 3.Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding of 7 ATP and GroES to GroEL results in the displacement of GroEL-bound substrate protein into an enclosed folding cage, the so-called cis complex. Proteins up to ∼60 kDa can become enclosed and fold in the confined environment of the cage in the time it takes the 7 ATP to be hydrolyzed to ADP (∼10–15 s at 25 °C). Upon completion of this first round of ATP hydrolysis, binding of 7 ATP to the opposite ring of GroEL (the trans ring) transmits an allosteric signal to the cis ring, causing the dissociation of the 7 ADP and GroES. At this point, folded protein leaves the cage, whereas incompletely folded intermediates are rapidly recaptured by the same or another GroEL complex for a subsequent folding cycle. Recently, it has been shown that GroEL can assist in the folding of certain proteins too large to be enclosed by GroES using a mechanism that involves cycling on and off the trans ring (14.Chaudhuri T.K.

In contrast to the group I chaperonins, the group II chaperonins of the archaeal cytosol (known as thermosome) are composed of 1 to 3 types of different subunits and form double-ring structures with 8- or 9-fold symmetry (16.Archibald J.M. Logsdon J.M. Doolittle W.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1053-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Significantly greater structural complexity is exhibited by the group II chaperonin of the eukaryotic cytosol (known as CCT for chaperonin containing TCP-1 or as TRiC for TCP-1 ring complex), which consists of eight orthologous subunits per ring. The group II chaperonins are generally independent of a Hsp10 (GroES)-like cofactor but cooperate with the molecular chaperone prefoldin (also called GimC) in Archaea and eukaryotes (17.Leroux M.R. Fandrich M. Klunker D. Siegers K. Lupas A.N. Brown J.R. Schiebel E. Dobson C.M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6730-6743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C.

Their mechanism of action involves protein encapsulation by helical extensions of the apical chaperonin domains that provide a “built in” GroES function (22.Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D.

It has generally been assumed that groups I and II chaperonins do not co-exist in the same cellular compartment. However, the recent genome sequencing of three mesophilic archaea, Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri; ∼2.8 Mbp, US DOE Joint Genome Institute), Methanosarcina acetivorans (M. acetivorans, ∼5.8 Mbp) (23.Galagan J.E.

Haas B. Hirtreiter A. Figueiredo L. Naylor D.J. Pfeifer G. Müller V. Deppenmeier U. Gottschalk G. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. J. Biol.

The M. mazei (Mm) and E. coli (Ec) GroEL/GroES systems exhibit 54% sequence identity and 72% similarity. So far, almost all our knowledge of the group I chaperonin mechanism has come from studies of the bacterial EcGroEL/GroES system. A functional analysis of the archaeal MmGroEL/GroES system in comparison to its bacterial counterpart now offers the opportunity to define general features of group I chaperonin function that have been conserved in evolution. Moreover, it may provide insight into how the archaeal MmGroEL/GroES system functionally adapted because of co-evolution with the group II chaperonin. Here we show that MmGroEL/GroES is unable to functionally replace EcGroEL/GroES in E. coli. However, the MmGroES protein can largely complement a mutant EcGroES protein in vivo. The ATPase rate of MmGroEL is very low and the dissociation of MmGroES from MmGroEL is 15 times slower than for the EcGroEL/GroES system. Indeed, model substrates such as rhodanese accumulate in a folded state inside the MmGroEL/GroES folding cage before they are released into the medium. Optimal functionality of MmGroEL/GroES and substrate encapsulation requires the presence of ammonium sulfate. Interestingly, in the absence of ammonium sulfate, stringently GroEL-dependent proteins such as malate dehydrogenase fail to be encapsulated by GroES and rather cycle on and off the GroEL trans ring in a non-productive reaction. These results indicate that the archaeal GroEL/GroES system has preserved the basic encapsulation mechanism of bacterial GroEL and suggest that it has adjusted the length of its reaction cycle to the slower growth rates of Archaea. Additionally, the release of only folded protein from the GroEL/GroES cage would avoid non-productive interactions of the GroEL substrates with the thermosome, which is not normally located within the same compartment. E. coli GroEL and GroES and M. mazei GroEL and GroES were purified as described (25.Klunker D. Haas B. Hirtreiter A. Figueiredo L. Naylor D.J. Pfeifer G. Müller V. Deppenmeier U. Gottschalk G.

EcGroES and MmGroES were cloned into pET-22b (Novagen) resulting in C-terminal His-tagged constructs, allowing immobilization on the NTA (nitrilotriacetate) biosensor chip. The His-tagged GroES proteins were overexpressed by induction in BL21(DE3) with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Supernatants were applied on Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) and the GroES fractions were further purified by chromatography on Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer composed of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Bovine mitochondrial rhodanese and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) from porcine heart were purchased from Sigma. Protein concentrations were determined using calculated molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 9080 m-1 cm-1 for EcGroEL; 1,280 m-1 cm-1 for EcGroES; 10,360 m-1 cm-1 for MmGroEL; 5120 m-1 cm-1 for MmGroES; 59,840 m-1 cm-1 for rhodanese; 7,680 m-1 cm-1 for MDH. The antibodies against rhodanese and MDH were prepared by immunizing rabbits with a 1:1 emulsion of the purchased proteins with Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). The parental E. coli strain used in this study is B178, a W3110 galE sup+ derivative. B178 and MC4100Δara714 have been previously described (26.Zeilstra R.J. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J.

This CamR-encoding cassette is ∼50–60% linked to a nearby Tn10 transposon, encoding resistance to tetracycline (TetR), i.e. when one selects first for the TetR marker in the recipient strain, then ∼50% of such transductants should simultaneously become CamR, provided the essential EcgroESgroEL operon (32.Fayet O. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) is carried on a plasmid. Accordingly, the bacteriophage P1 lysate grown on strain AR189 was used to infect wild-type E. coli B178 strains carrying various plasmid constructs (Tables I and II). TetR transductants were selected on LB-agar plates supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline and 5 mm sodium citrate (to prevent re-infection and killing by the P1 bacteriophage). Following incubation for 2 days at 30 °C, TetR colonies were tested for inheritance of the CamR marker by cross-streaking the TetR transductants on LB-agar plates supplemented with 5 mm sodium citrate and either 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline or 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, followed by incubation overnight at 30 °C.Table IThe MmgroESgroEL operon cannot replace EcgroESgroEL in vivo The ability to cotransduce the chromosomally encoded TetR and CamR alleles indicates that the plasmid-encoded genes can replace the groESgroEL operon of E. coli.

Bacterial transformants were grown at 30 °C overnight in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin without arabinose. For complementation of the bacterial temperature-sensitive phenotype at 43 °C, bacterial cultures were serially diluted 10-fold and 3-μl aliquots spot-tested on LB-agar plates supplemented with 0.1% arabinose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight at 30 and 43 °C for 16 h. For complementation of bacteriophage λ, T4 or T5 growth, 0.3-ml aliquots of overnight cultures in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin were added to 3 ml of LB soft agar (0.66% agar) and evenly distributed over LB-agar plates containing 0.1% arabinose. When the soft agar solidified, 3-μl aliquots of 10-fold dilutions of various bacteriophage lysates were spotted on the bacterial lawn and, following drying of the plates, incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. GroEL (1 μm oligomer) was added to Buffer A (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) or Buffer A, 0.5 m ammonium sulfate (AS) and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, GroES was present at a 2-fold molar excess over GroEL. The reaction was initiated at 37 °C by the addition of 2 mm ATP. The kinetics of the ATPase activities of EcGroEL and MmGroEL were followed for 0-5 and 0–25 min, taking time points every 1 and 5 min, respectively. ATPase activity at the various time points was stopped by the addition of ∼15 mm CDTA. Quantification of liberated inorganic phosphate was performed by the malachite green assay (33.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar) after incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, and absorption was measured at 640 nm. A calibration curve of inorganic phosphate (0–20 nmol) was measured in parallel. No spontaneous ATP hydrolysis was observed under the conditions used. Rhodanese Refolding—Rhodanese was denatured by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in denaturing buffer (6 m guanidinium HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and diluted 100-fold into Buffer A or Buffer A, 0.5 m AS at 37 °C in the absence or presence of various concentrations of the chaperonins (as specified in the figure legends). At the times indicated, chaperonin action was stopped with CDTA (50 mm) and rhodanese activity measured at 460 nm at 25 °C, as previously described (34.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A.

The time dependent oxidation of β-NADH was monitored for ∼1 min at 340 nm. At 5 and 45 min into the chaperonin-assisted refolding assays of rhodanese or MDH, an aliquot of 50 μl was withdrawn from the reaction and further ATP hydrolysis was inhibited by the addition of 25 mm glucose and 0.3 units/μl hexokinase (Roche Diagnostics). The sample was then applied onto a Superose 6 3.2/30 (Amersham Biosciences) size exclusion column equilibrated in Buffer A. Fractions were analyzed for enzyme activity and/or resolved by 16% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting with anti-rhodanese or anti-MDH antibodies. MDH was denatured as described above and diluted 100-fold into Buffer A or Buffer A, 0.5 m AS in the presence of an equimolar concentration of GroEL chaperonin at 37 °C. Protein aggregates were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was divided into two equal portions, one portion receiving 4 mm AMP-PNP (or 2 mm ADP) and the other 4 mm AMP-PNP (or 2 mm ADP), 1 μm GroES, followed by incubation for 5 min. Treatment with 1.5 μg/ml proteinase K (from Tritirachium album, Roche) was followed for 0–15 min at 25 °C and the proteinase K action stopped with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Half of each reaction was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining for GroEL, whereas the other half was resolved by 16% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with MDH antibodies. EcGroES and MmGroES, modified with a C-terminal His6 tag, were immobilized (∼30 response units) on a chelating NTA biosensor chip (BIAcore Inc. (38.Nieba L. Niebaaxmann S.E. Persson A. Hamalainen M.

In this report, we show that DHT induces a dose-dependent increase in G0/G1 growth-arrested cells using physiological levels of hormone. The arrested cells increase in cell size and contain a dramatic redistribution of desmoplakin, keratin 5, and chromogranin A proteins. DHT-induced cytoskeletal changes were also apparent from time lapse video microscopy that showed that androgen treatment resulted in the rapid appearance of neuronal-like membrane extensions. Expression profiling analysis using RNA isolated from DHT-treated HT-AR1 cells revealed that androgen receptor activation leads to the coordinate expression of numerous cell signaling genes including RhoB, PTGF-β, caveolin-2, Egr-1, myosin 1B, and EHM2. Because RhoB has been shown to have a role in tumor suppression and neuronal differentiation in other cell types, we investigated RhoB signaling functions in the HT-AR1 steroid response. We found that steroid induction of RhoB was DHT-specific and that newly synthesized RhoB protein was post-translationally modified and localized to endocytic vesicles. Moreover, treatment with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor reduced DHT-dependent growth arrest, suggesting that prenylated RhoB might function to inhibit HT-AR1 cell proliferation.

Therefore, we recently developed an alternative cell model to study androgen control of cytoskeletal organization by taking advantage of the well characterized human cell line HT-1080 (12.Rasheed S.

Because androgen and glucocorticoid responses are partially overlapping in a variety of cell types (18.Rundlett S.E. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Cell.

(21.Chauhan S. Pandey R. Way J. Sroka T.C. Demetriou M.C. Kunz S. Cress A.E. Mount D.W. Miesfeld R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Similarly we found that DHT treatment induced fibronectin protein expression, however, unlike Dex, DHT treatment also led to pronounced HT-AR1 cell growth arrest and increased expression of chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and the recently discovered FERM domain encoding gene EHM2 (21.Chauhan S. Pandey R. Way J. Sroka T.C. Demetriou M.C. Kunz S. Cress A.E. Mount D.W. Miesfeld R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The androgen response of HT-AR1 cells was shown to be AR-dependent because a puromycin-resistant HT-1080 subclone containing only the expression vector (HT-VC1) was insensitive to DHT treatment.In this report, we describe results of experiments aimed at identifying key downstream signaling events that are required for the AR-dependent response of HT-AR1 cells. Cell biological studies and expression profiling demonstrated that androgen signaling induces transcriptional reprogramming of HT-AR1 cells resulting in cell cycle arrest, cytoskeletal reorganization, and coordinate expression of numerous cell signaling genes. One of these differentially expressed genes was RhoB, a small GTPase that is post-translationally modified by prenylation and functions to regulate cell growth (22.Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G.

Although much is known about the upstream and downstream effectors of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, the best characterized members of this family of small GTPases, regulation of RhoB activity, and identification of RhoB targets are not well understood (30.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). To investigate RhoB signaling in fibrosarcoma cells, we use a combination of experimental approaches to demonstrate that DHT-induced expression of RhoB in HT-AR1 cells contributes to the androgen response phenotype by mediating growth arrest, a result that is consistent with the proposed tumor suppressing activities of RhoB (22.Chen Z.

Pandey R. Way J. Sroka T.C. Demetriou M.C. Kunz S. Cress A.E. Mount D.W. Miesfeld R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Selection media was made by combining Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media with defined calf bovine serum (CBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT) to 10% (v/v), streptomycin (Sigma) to 0.1 mg/ml, penicillin G (Sigma) to 100 units/ml, 0.3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and filter sterilized in the final step with a 0.22 μm filter membrane. Five days prior to an experiment, HT-AR1 cells were grown in selection media to reselect cells containing the AR expression vector (pDC-hAR-PAC (21.Chauhan S. Pandey R. Way J. Sroka T.C. Demetriou M.C. Kunz S. Cress A.E. Mount D.W. Miesfeld R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). All experiments were performed in culture media (selection media without puromycin) containing 10% CBS or 5% heat-inactivated charcoal-stripped (C/S) serum as described in the text. Cell cycle analysis of HT-AR1 cells was performed after growth for 3 days in culture media with or without 10 nm DHT. The cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in methanol at 4 °C for 15 min. The cells were then incubated in modified Kirshan buffer (20 μg/ml RNase A, 3.4 mm sodium citrate, 0.3% Nonidet P-40) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Propidium iodide fluorescence of nuclei was determined using FACScan (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with CELLQuest ModFit LT 2.0.Immunostaining—Detection of protein expression in HT-AR1 cells by immunostaining was performed using antibodies specific for the androgen receptor (Santa Cruz SC-815, 1:10 dilution), desmoplakin (Progen antibodies 2.15, 2.17, 2.20, undiluted mixture), cytokeratin 5 (BD Pharmingen RCK 103, 1:10 dilution), chromogranin A (Zymed Laboratories Inc. 18-0094, 1:60 dilution), RhoB (Santa Cruz SC-180, 1:10 dilution), and hemagglutinin (Roche 3F10, 1:10 dilution). Cells were grown in culture media containing 5% C/S CBS on 12-mm coverslips coated with human fibronectin, allowed to adhere overnight, and then supplemented with fresh media ± DHT (10 nm). After 4 days, the coverslips were harvested, dipped sequentially in phosphate-buffered saline, chilled in 100% methanol (10 min) and cold acetone (dipped six times), and then air dried. Diluted primary antibodies were applied to cells for 30 min at room temperature and then the coverslips were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min each. Primary antibodies were detected with either anti-rabbit Alexa 568 or anti-mouse Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes) using 1:400 dilution. For some experiments, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) using a stock of 2 mg/ml diluted to 1:100 for use, rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline for 2–3 min each, and post-fixed in 100% ethanol and mounted using Mowial (Sigma). Stained cells were visualized using appropriate filters on a Zeiss Axiophot 200 microscope and imaged using Axiovision software.Time Lapse Video Microscopy—Cells were seeded on a glass Delta T dish (0.15 mm; Bioptechs, Inc. Butler, PA) at 40,000/dish and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media selection containing 10% CBS at 37 °C. The following morning, fresh culture media with 10% CBS was added with or without DHT and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before beginning the time lapse video. Images were captured using a grayscale CCD camera (ORCA-100, Hamamatsu, Japan) mounted on an inverted Olympus IMT2 microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY) equipped with a BiopTechs Delta T live cell system (Bioptechs, Inc. Butler, PA) under a humidified (5% CO2 balanced with ultrazero air) atmosphere. Data analysis was performed using SimplePCI 4.0 software (Compix Imaging Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Representative video images obtained from HT-AR1 cells grown in ±DHT media during the first 15 min are presented in Fig. 3 and 5 h of the 16-h time lapse video are contained in the Supplemental Materials (available at http://www.jbc.org).Expression Profiling—Total RNA was isolated from untreated and DHT-treated HT-AR1 cells using the RNA-Bee™ RNA isolation reagent (Tel-test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Fluorescently labeled cDNA was prepared from 30 μg of total RNA using Micromax direct cDNA microarray system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Cy3 (control) or Cy5 (experimental) fluorescent dyes. Labeled cDNA was purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), combined into one tube, and precipitated at –20 °C overnight using 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and isopropyl alcohol. The human cDNA microarray slides containing 5,300 human gene sequences were obtained from the Microarray Core Service of the Arizona Cancer Center. 2azcc-microarray.arl.arizona.edu. Slide hybridization, washing, and processing were performed as previously described (21.Chauhan S. Pandey R. Way J. Sroka T.C. Demetriou M.C. Kunz S. Cress A.E. Mount D.W. Miesfeld R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Slides were scanned for fluorescent emission using Gene Pix 4000A microarray Scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.) was used to analyze the fluorescence intensities and to format the intensity data as logtransformed ratio values. The data were filtered by eliminating genes in which no hybridization signal was detected at two or more time points. All genes used for expression profiling analysis were validated by replica hybridizations and by visual inspection of the primary data using GenePix 4.0 analysis software. The Arizona Cancer Center BioResource for Gene Array analysis (BioRag) was used for initial screening of differentially expressed genes to identify candidates most likely involved in cell signaling. This resource can be accessed online. 3www.biorag.org. A complete list of DHT-regulated genes in HT-AR1 cells can be obtained on request.Northern Blots—Total RNA was isolated from untreated and DHT-treated HT-AR1 cells as described above and equal amounts of RNA (20 μg) were run on a denaturing formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Duralon-UV™ membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by standard capillary methods using 10× SSC. Subsequently, RNA was UV crosslinked to the nylon membrane using UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) and Northern blotting was performed using radioactively labeled cDNA probes as described (21.Chauhan S. Pandey R. Way J. Sroka T.C. Demetriou M.C. Kunz S. Cress A.E. Mount D.W. Miesfeld R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The GenBank™ sequences used to generate cDNA probes from ATCC clones were RhoB (X06820), PTGF-β (AA450062), CAV2 (T89391), Egr-1 (AA486628), Myo1B (N95358), EHM2 (AA948217), FKBP51 (W86653), and urokinase plasminogen activator (AA284668). Sequential hybridization and rehybridization was performed with each of the eight cDNA probes using the same Duralon-UV membrane after stripping the blot twice with hot (92 °C) 0.02% SDS in double distilled H2O after each hybridization round.Western Blots—For most blots, cells were lysed on the tissue culture dish with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.5) plus protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm; leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 μg/ml). The lysate was briefly sonicated on ice and protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Protein samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared by adding 20 μg of protein with equal volumes of 2× reducing sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and after a quick chill on ice they were loaded onto 7.5, 12.5, or 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred to Millipore Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and incubated with antibodies specific for α-tubulin (Sigma B512), RhoB (Santa Cruz SC-180), PTGFβ (Santa Cruz SC-10603), caveolin-2 (BD Bioscience 610684), EGR-1 (Santa Cruz SC-110), integrin α6 (AA6A previously described (31.Davis T.

Secondary antibodies used in Western blotting were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting Detection System, Amersham Biosciences).DNA Transfections—Transient transfections were performed in 6- or 12-well plates using 1 μg of plasmid DNA and Polyfect transfection reagent according the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DHT was added after 4 h of Polyfect treatment and cells were harvested 16–24 h later for cell counting and immunostaining with anti-HA antibody. The human RhoB pCDNA3.1 plasmids were obtained from the Guthrie Institute (Sayer, PA) and contained a 3× hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the N terminus of either an activating RhoB mutation (G14V) called HA-RhoBact, or a dominant negative RhoB mutation (T19N) called HA-RhoBdn. The HT-AR1 stable cell lines were generated by recloning the HA-RhoBact and HA-RhoBdn constructs into the tetracycline-regulated expression vector (pCDNA4/TO) (T-Rex expression system, Invitrogen, Inc.). The pCDNA4/TO RhoB plasmids were stably co-transfected into HT-AR1 cells with the tetracycline repressor expressing plasmid pCDNA6/TR at a molar ratio of 1:6 using Avanti DOTAP:DOPE lipofection reagent (Alabaster, AL). Both the TO and TR vectors were linearized before transfection with the enzyme Bst1107, which cleaves once in the vector backbone. Colonies were isolated and expanded in selection media containing 10% tetracyclinefree serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1.0 μg/ml zeocin, and 0.6 μg/ml blasticidin according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen Inc.). Candidate HT-AR1 T-Rex subclones were screened for tetracycline-regulated expression by treating cells with 1.0 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 16 h and preparing protein extracts for analysis by anti-HA Western blots. The efficiency of obtaining HT-AR1 subclones that exhibited low basal level expression of HA-RhoB protein with a 10–50-fold Dox induction was >70%. 4K. Davis and R. L. Miesfeld, unpublished data. RESULTSPhysiological Levels of DHT Induce G0/G1 Growth Arrest— Treatment of HT-AR1 cells with 100 nm DHT was shown by Chauhan et al. (21.Chauhan S. Pandey R. Way J. Sroka T.C. Demetriou M.C. Kunz S. Cress A.E. Mount D.W. Miesfeld R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to induce growth arrest over a 3–7-day period with no evidence of apoptosis. To determine whether the observed DHT-dependent growth inhibition was because of super physiological levels of steroid, we cultured HT-AR1 cells for 4 days with or without the addition of 10 pm to 1 μm DHT. As shown in Fig. 1A, HT-AR1 cell growth was found to be inhibited up to 90% by DHT concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 1 μm, with a small but reproducible growth stimulatory effect at 100 pm DHT.Fig. 1Growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest in DHT-treated HT-AR1 cells.

The inset shows a plot of FACS forward and side scatter data as an indication of cell size under each culture condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To better understand the nature of this growth arrest phenotype, we performed cell cycle analysis using fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to determine whether growth inhibition was because of cell cycle arrest. The data shown in Fig. 1B revealed that following 3 days of culture in DHT, there was a 28% increase in the number of HT-AR1 cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle relative to untreated cells. Moreover, we observed a concomitant decrease in the number of HT-AR1 cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, showing only 62 (S) and 83% (G2/M) of the cells in DHT-treated cultures as compared with untreated controls. In addition, cell size determinations based on forward and side scatter measurements showed that DHT-treated HT-AR1 cells were consistently larger than untreated cells (Fig. 1B, inset).Cytoskeletal Reorganization in DHT-treated HT-AR1 Cells— Based on the finding that DHT treatment of HT-AR1 cells induced a growth arrest phenotype that was accompanied by an increase in cell size (Fig. 1B), we used immunostaining to determine whether the expression level and cellular distribution of desmoplakin, keratin 5, and chromogranin A proteins was altered by DHT treatment as might be expected for differentiating cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, HT-AR1 cells displayed a spindle cell shape and grew to high cell densities when cultured in C/S CBS media on fibronectin-coated coverslips for 4 days. However, when DHT was added to the media for the same time period, the cells flattened out and cell boundaries were greatly extended. Immunostaining of these cells with AR antibody revealed that DHT treatment resulted in predominant nuclear localization of AR that would be consistent with the induction of a AR-mediated genomic response in HT-AR1 cells (33.Losel R.M.

A, cell morphology and AR protein expression in HT-AR1 cells cultured for 3 days on fibronectin-coated coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 5% C/S CBS serum with or without 10 nm DHT. AR protein was detected by immunostaining using an anti-AR antibody. The same field of cells is shown by phase-contrast or fluorescence microscopy. B, HT-AR1 cells cultured the same as in A and stained with antibodies that specifically recognize desmoplakin, keratin 5, or chromogranin A. The cells in the keratin 5 immunostaining were counterstained with Hoechst dye to visualize the nuclei.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the same growth conditions, the data in Fig. 2B show that untreated HT-AR1 cells contained diffuse desmoplakin staining, whereas DHT-treated HT-AR1 cells displayed a clear condensation of desmoplakin along cell boundaries (see arrowheads). Desmoplakin polarization at cell boundaries is characteristic of differentiated cells undergoing desmosome production (34.Jones J.C. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with our earlier results (21.Chauhan S. Pandey R. Way J. Sroka T.C. Demetriou M.C. Kunz S. Cress A.E. Mount D.W. Miesfeld R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), immunostaining of DHT-treated HT-AR1 cells using an antikeratin 5 antibody (RCK103), revealed increased levels of highly organized keratin 5 protein that extended into intracellular networks. The expression of cytokeratin 5 in DHT-treated HT-AR1 cells suggests that HT-1080 cells can acquire epithelial cell-like qualities upon activation of androgen signaling. We have previously confirmed that the HT-AR1 subclone and HT-1080 cell line are isogenic by comparing the HT-AR1 and HT-1080 genotypes at 11 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (21.Chauhan S.

https://openalex.org/W1995456587,"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2/FLK-1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activation stimulates angiogenesis. We recently generated a chimeric VEGFR-2 in which the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 was replaced with the extracellular domain of human colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and expressed in endothelial cells. To study the contribution of the carboxyl terminus to activation of VEGFR-2, we created a panel of truncated receptors in which the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 was progressively deleted. Removal of the entire carboxyl terminus eliminated activation of VEGFR-2, its ability to activate signaling proteins, and its ability to stimulate cell proliferation. The carboxyl terminus-deleted VEGFR-2 exhibited impaired ligand-dependent down-regulation and inhibited the activation of wild-type receptor in a dominant-negative fashion. Furthermore, introducing the carboxyl terminus of another receptor, i.e., VEGFR-1, restored the ligand-dependent activation of the carboxyl terminus-deleted VEGFR-2 and its ability to stimulate cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 plays a critical role in VEGFR-2 activation, its ability to activate signaling proteins, and its ability to induce biological responses. The presence of at least 57 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 are required for VEGFR-2 activation. Thus, we propose that the carboxyl terminus is required for activation of VEGFR-2, and absence of the carboxyl terminus renders VEGFR-2 inactive.

Activation of VEGFR-2 is required for normal embryonic vascular development and pathological angiogenesis (1.Shalaby F. Ho J. Stanford W.L. Fischer K.D. Schuh A.C. Schwartz L. Bernstein A. Rossant J.

The engagement of VEGFR-2 catalytic activity by ligand stimulation initiates the intracellular signal relay of VEGFR-2 and angiogenesis (4.Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1615-1620PubMed Google Scholar). However, fundamental issues regarding this key event have not been adequately addressed. Recent structure resolution of RTKs, including the insulin receptor (6.Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (7.Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), demonstrate that these receptors bind ATP-Mg2+ and phosphorylate at least one of three tyrosine sites in the activation loop. These crystal structures reveal that in the unstimulated state, the activation loop orients these tyrosine sites toward the activation sites of the enzyme and thereby sterically prevents them from binding to ATP-Mg2+. It is suggested that phosphorylation of these tyrosines in the catalytic loop orients the inhibitory loop away from the active site, enabling the RTK to bind ATP-Mg2+and efficiently phosphorylate substrates. As a result of ligand binding, the receptor reorients such that it is now able to transphosphorylate and thereby activates each other's kinase activity (8.Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3527) Google Scholar, 9.Hubbard S.R. Front.Biosci. 2002; 7: 330-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, structural data combined with many elegant biochemical studies of RTKs provide direct evidence for the regulation of kinase activation by the activation loop. To date, the contribution of carboxyl and juxtamembrane (JM) domains to RTK activation is less understood. The recent resolution of the crystal structure of Tie-2 reveals that the activation loop, unlike other RTKs, is in an inhibitory conformation, and its carboxyl terminus may block access to the substrate binding site (10.Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that other domains of RTKs, such as JM and carboxyl domains, may regulate the catalytic activation of RTKs. Of the published crystal structure of RTKs resolved to date, the JM and carboxyl domains are not included (6.Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 7.Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10049-10055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of these domains to activation of RTKs remains unknown. The recent resolution of the crystal structure of VEGFR-2 revealed that the activation loop of VEGFR-2 is highly disordered and resides in an inhibitory conformation (12.McTigue M.A. Wickersham J.A. Pinko C. Showalter R.E. Parast C.V. Tempczyk-Russell A. Gehring M.R. Mroczkowski B. Kan C.C. Villafranca J.E. Appelt K. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This crystal structure, however, was resolved without its carboxyl terminus. We postulated that the presence of the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 is required for its activation, and the absence of it prevents VEGFR-2 from changing its conformation from an inhibitory to an active conformation. In the present study, we have tested the involvement of the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 in its ligand-dependent activation. Our results demonstrate that partial deletion of the carboxyl domain of VEGFR-2 preserves its ligand-dependent activation. However, deletion of the entire carboxyl terminus abolished its ligand-dependent autophosphorylation, its ability to activate signaling proteins, and its ability to stimulate biological responses. Introducing the carboxyl domain of VEGFR-1/FLT-1 restored the ligand-dependent activation of the carboxyl terminus-deleted receptor and its ability to stimulate cell proliferation. Collectively, these results suggest that the presence of carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 is necessary for maximal autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and its ability to induce biological responses. Reagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant colony stimulating factor (CSF)-1 was purchased from R&D. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20), anti-phospholipase C (PLC)-γ, and anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit anti-MAPK and anti-phospho-MAPK were purchased from New England BioLabs (Boston, MA). Rabbit anti-phospho-PLC-γ and phosphotyrosine-1173 VEGFR-2, phosphotyrosine 1052 and 1057 antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Rabbit anti-VEGFR-2 antibody was made to amino acids corresponding to the kinase insert or carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 (4.Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and rabbit phospho-tyrosine-1212 VEGFR-2 antibodies were purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Lines—Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells expressing CSF-1R-FLK-1 Receptor (CKR) and truncated receptors were established by a retroviral system as described previously (13.Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding for CKR and mutant receptors were cloned into the retroviral vector, pLNCX2, and transfected into 293-GPG cells. Viral supernatants were collected for 7 days, concentrated by centrifugation, and used as described previously (14.Meyer R.D. Dayanir V. Majnoun F. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27081-27087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The VEGFR-2 chimera (CKR) was used as a template to construct the carboxyl terminus truncated CKR. The truncations were made using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (14.Meyer R.D. Dayanir V. Majnoun F. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27081-27087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15.Meyer R.D. Latz C. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16347-16355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The antisense PCR primer for ΔCKR/152 was GTCGACTATGTGTTGTCATAATGGAATTT. The antisense PCR primer for ΔCKR/157 was GTCGACTAGAATTTGGGGTCGCACACTTCCTCTT. The antisense PCR primer for ΔCKR/212 was GTCGACTATGTGTTGTCAAAATGGAATTT. ΔCKR/212 lacks the entire carboxyl terminus; 630 bp were deleted (3470-4100 bp). Its carboxyl terminus contains only two amino acids (Glu-1156 and His-1157) following its kinase domain. ΔCKR/152 was generated by deleting 460 bp of carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 corresponding to 3640-4100 bp. The carboxyl terminus of ΔCKR/152 contains 60 amino acids including tyrosines 1173 and 1212. ΔCKR/157 was made by deleting 473 bp (3627-4100). The carboxyl terminus of ΔCKR/157 contains 55 amino acids including tyrosine 1173. The resultant truncated receptors were verified by sequencing and were subsequently cloned into pLNCX2 or pLXSN2 vector by NotI and SalI sites. To generate the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 (C-tail) the entire carboxyl terminus (630 bp from 3470 to 4100) of VEGFR-2 was PCR amplified. The sense primer was also designed to contain a Kozak and a start codon. To create CKR/cFLT-1 (C-tail swapped CKR), we PCR amplified the entire carboxyl tail of human FLT-1/VEGFR-1 (558 nucleotides, 3957-3399) and the entire CKR but without its carboxyl tail. The two PCR products were ligated in frame using a BclI site and subsequently cloned into the pLNCX2 vector. The sequences of all the constructs were verified by sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—PAE cells expressing CKR and tyrosine mutant CKRs were grown in a semiconfluent culture condition in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with glutamate, penicillin, and streptomycin and serum starved overnight in DMEM. Cells were left either resting or stimulated with 40 ng/ml CSF-1 for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with H/S buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm Na3VO4) and lysed in lysis (EB) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Proteins were immunoprecipitated by using appropriate antibodies. Immunocomplexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with 1.0 ml of EB. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane. For Western blot analysis, the membranes were incubated for 60 min in Block solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes then were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in Block for another 60 min. Membrane was washed three times in Western rinse, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-secondary antibody, washed, and developed with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, membranes were stripped by incubating them in a stripping buffer containing 6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min, washed in Western rinse, and reprobed with antibody of interest. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Equal numbers of PAE cells individually expressing CKR, ΔCKR/152, ΔCKR/157, and ΔCKR/212 were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating cells with 0.5 mg/ml of the membrane-impermeable biotin analog EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) Hexanoate) (Pierce) in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed by three washes with ice-cold H/S buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm Na3VO4) at 4 °C. Biotinylated cells were then harvested on ice with 0.3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of protein from each lysate were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (1410). Antigen-antibody complexes were allowed to bind protein A-Sepharose conjugated beads for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes with 1.0 ml of EB buffer. Immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blot analysis using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and were detected by ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Labeling—The ligand-dependent down-regulation of CKR and ΔCKR/152, 157, and 212 were evaluated by pulse-chase analysis using a mixture of 35S-labeled l-methionine/l-cysteine. In brief, equal numbers of PAE cells were plated in tissue culture dishes containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then starved for ∼16 h in serum-free medium. The medium was removed, and cells were rinsed two times with PBS before an additional 2 h of starvation at 37 °C in l-methionine/l-cystine free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were pulse-labeled by adding 75 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cystine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h at 37 °C and then chased with DMEM supplemented with 100-fold excess l-methionine and l-cysteine. Cells were stimulated with CSF-1 (20 ng/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated times. Finally, cells were washed with ice-cold H/S buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm Na3VO4) and lysed with cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of protein from each cell lysate were immunoprecipitated using anti-VEGFR-2 antibody (1410), which recognizes the kinase insert of VEGFR-2. Immunocomplexed proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and gels were prepared for autoradiography by soaking in a fixing solution followed by incubation in an enhancing solution. Gels were then rinsed with water, dried, and exposed to film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 h at -70 °C. Autoradiographs were quantified using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cell Proliferation—The proliferation assay was performed as described before (4.Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/ml in 24-well plates containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and serum starved with DMEM overnight. Cells were then given various concentrations of CSF-1. At the last 4 h of incubation, cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (0.2 μCi/ml) and harvested. Results for each group were collected from four samples. Each experiment was repeated three times, and essentially the same results were obtained. The data are presented as fold increase over control. Carboxyl Terminus of VEGFR-2 Is Important for Its Ligand-dependent Activation—To study the selective ligand-dependent biological and biochemical functions of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells, we recently generated a chimeric VEGFR-2 (herein called CKR) in which the extracellular domain of human CSF-1R was fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse VEGFR-2 and was stably expressed in PAE cells (4.Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The carboxyl tail of VEGFR-2 contains 214 amino acids with six potential tyrosine phosphorylation residues (Fig. 1A). In this study, we have used CKR to generate a panel of truncated receptors in which the carboxyl terminus of CKR was progressively deleted by 152, 157, and 212 amino acids. As presented in Fig. 1A, deletion of 152 amino acids generates a receptor with two tyrosine sites at the carboxyl terminus, namely tyrosines 1173 and 1212, but it eliminates tyrosines 1221,1303, 1307, and 1317. Deletion of 157 amino acids generates a truncated receptor with only one tyrosine site, namely 1173 at its carboxyl terminus. Finally, deletion of 212 amino acids removes the entire carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2, including tyrosines 1173 and 1212. The truncated receptors are herein called ΔCKR/152, ΔCKR/157, and ΔCKR/212. The truncated receptors were expressed in PAE cells using a retroviral system. PAE cells individually expressing wild-type receptor and truncated receptors were lysed and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-VEGFR-2 antibody, which specifically recognizes the kinase insert domain of VEGFR-2. Fig. 1B shows that the wild-type receptor and the truncated receptors are expressed at relatively similar levels in PAE cells. In addition, the expression of these truncated receptors at the surface of PAE cells was also analyzed by labeling cells with biotin. As presented in Fig. 1C, all the truncated receptors were expressed at the surface of PAE cells. To test the relative significance of carboxyl terminus to ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of CKR, we first analyzed the ability of truncated CKRs to undergo ligand-dependent autophosphorylation in vivo. Fig. 2A shows that the deletion of 152 and 157 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of CKR had no significant effect on the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. However, deletion of 212 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor, which entirely removes its carboxyl tail, abolished its ligand-dependent autophosphorylation (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation of at least two highly conserved and specific tyrosine residues at the activation loop of RTKs is suggested to control ligand-dependent activation of RTKs (16.Cunningham M.E. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10957-10967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.Cunningham M.E. Greene L.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7282-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosines 1052 and 1057, located in the activation loop of VEGFR-2, is required for its activation and signaling (18.Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To directly test the contribution of carboxyl tail toward ligand-dependent activation of CKR, we have used a recently developed anti-phospho-specific antibody directed against phospho-tyrosines 1052 and 1057 residues of VEGFR-2. The initial analysis and characterization of this antibody showed that this antibody selectively recognizes phospho-tyrosines 1052 and 1057, because the mutation of these tyrosine sites abolished the ability of this antibody to detect tyrosine phosphorylated CKR (data not shown). To test whether tyrosines 1052 and 1057 of CKR are phosphorylated in CKR and ΔCKRs, we analyzed the ligand-dependent activation of CKR. The data as presented in Fig. 2C shows that tyrosines 1052 and 1057 are highly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation in wild-type CKR, ΔCKR/152, and ΔCKR/157. In contrast, these tyrosines are not phosphorylated in ΔCKR/212, suggesting that this receptor does not undergo ligand-dependent activation. Altogether, these data suggest that 157 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus are dispensable for full activation of VEGFR-2. However, at least 57 amino acids of the carboxyl tail are required for ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2. Interestingly, among the 57 amino acids in this region, there are two tyrosine sites, namely tyrosines 1173 and 1212. The ligand-dependent phosphorylation of these sites may in part directly or indirectly contribute to the activation of VEGFR-2. Tyrosines 1173 and 1212 of VEGFR-2 Are Phosphorylated in a Ligand-dependent Manner in Vivo—To further examine the possibility that tyrosines 1173 and 1212 are phosphorylated in vivo, we used recently developed anti-phospho-specific tyrosine 1173 and phospho-specific tyrosine 1212 antibodies. To this end, cells expressing wild-type CKR, F1212/CKR, and E1212/CKR were stimulated with CSF-1 for 10 min, and total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using phospho-specific tyrosine 1212 antibody. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, the anti-phospho-specific tyrosine 1212 antibody recognizes only wild-type CKR stimulated with CSF-1 but not the F1212/CKR and E1212/CKR. This suggests that tyrosine 1212 of murine VEGFR-2 is phosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation in endothelial cells. To test phosphorylation of tyrosine 1173, we used cells expressing wild-type CKR, F1173/CKR, ΔCKR/152, and ΔCKR/157. As shown in Fig. 3C, a phospho-specific tyrosine-1173 antibody selectively detected the ligand-stimulated CKR, ΔCKR/152, and ΔCKR/157 but not F1173/CKR. Thus, both tyrosines 1212 and 1173 of VEGFR-2 are phosphorylated in endothelial cells and may participate in ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 and/or in its downstream signaling. We have recently shown that the presence of tyrosine 1212 in the context of full-length chimeric VEGFR-2 is required for maximal ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 (14.Meyer R.D. Dayanir V. Majnoun F. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27081-27087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 1173 on mouse VEGFR-2 along with tyrosine 799 is involved in the recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (19.Dayanir V. Meyer R.D. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17686-17692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To test the potential involvement of tyrosines 1173 and 1212 to the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in the context of ΔCKR/152, which contains only two tyrosine phosphorylation sites, namely tyrosine 1173 and 1212, we mutated these tyrosines to phenylalanine (Fig. 3E). The tyrosine mutant ΔCKR/152 is herein called ΔCKR/152/F2. Analysis of the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of ΔCKR/152/F2 revealed that this receptor was unexpectedly able to undergo ligand-dependent autophosphorylation with no apparent decrease in its autophosphorylation (Fig. 3F). Altogether, these data suggest that although phosphorylation of tyrosine 1212 in the context of full-length VEGFR-2 directly or indirectly participates in the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, phosphorylation of tyrosine 1212 in the context of carboxyl terminus-deleted VEGFR-2 appears to play a compensatory role in its ligand-dependent autophosphorylation. These data suggest that 157 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus are dispensable for full activation of VEGFR-2. At least 57 amino acids at carboxyl tail are required for ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Carboxyl Tail Is Required for Efficient Ligand-dependent Down-Regulation of VEGFR-2—Ligand binding to RTKs is associated with their activation, leading to subsequent down-regulation and removal from the cell surface (20.Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 21.Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). To test the putative role of the carboxyl tail of VEGFR-2 to its ligand-dependent down-regulation, we have analyzed the ability of wild-type and truncated chimeric receptors to undergo ligand-dependent down-regulation by pulse-chase analysis. As presented in Fig. 4A, stimulation of cells expressing CKR with CSF-1 promoted significant receptor degradation and down-regulation. Significant down-regulation of CKR was observed between 30 and 60 min of ligand stimulation, and no CKR protein could be detected after 120 min of ligand stimulation. Ligand-dependent down-regulation of ΔCKR/152 and ΔCKR 157 was partially reduced compared with that of wild-type CKR. The most noticeable differences in their ability to undergo ligand-dependent down-regulation were at 60 min (Fig. 4, B, C, and E). However, the ligand-dependent down-regulation of ΔCKR/212 was significantly impaired. Unlike-wild type CKR, the presence of ΔCKR/212 protein could be detected after 2 h of ligand stimulation (Fig. 4, D and E). Collectively, these results suggest that the carboxyl tail of VEGFR-2 is required for full ligand-dependent down-regulation of VEGFR-2. Because removal of tyrosines 1212 and 1173 greatly impairs the down-regulation of VEGFR-2, it is highly possible that phosphorylation of one or both of these tyrosines may recruit signaling proteins that might contribute to down-regulation of VEGFR-2. Requirement of Carboxyl Terminus for VEGFR-2-mediated Activation of Signaling Proteins—To test the ability of the carboxyl terminus truncated receptors to activate signaling proteins, we have analyzed the activation of PLCγ1, Akt, and MAPK. As presented in Fig. 5A, stimulation of ΔCKR/152 and ΔCKR/157 resulted in the activation of PLCγ1 comparable with that of wild-type receptor. This suggests that tyrosine residues located within this region, including 1221, 1303, and 1308, are not required for VEGFR-2-mediated PLCγ1 activation. Unlike ΔCKR/152 and ΔCKR/157, the ability of ΔCKR/212 to stimulate PLCγ1 significantly was compromised, and phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by this receptor was not observed (Fig. 5A). Similarly, both ΔCKR/152 and ΔCKR/157 but not ΔCKR/212 were able to stimulate AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). Although ΔCKR/212 failed to undergo to ligand-dependent autophosphorylation or to stimulate PLCγ1 and AKT, it was still able to stimulate MAPK phosphorylation. It should be noted that the ability of ΔCKR/212 to stimulate MAPK phosphorylation was slightly reduced compared with that of wild-type CKR, ΔCKR/152, and ΔCKR/157 (Fig. 5E). To further analyze the ability of carboxyl tail-truncated CKRs to activate signaling proteins, we measured their ability to associate with PLC-γ1 and p85 of PI3K. To this end we subjected stimulated cells to either GST pull-down (for PLC-γ1) or co-precipitation (for p85/PI3K) assays. Our results showed that wild-type CKR, ΔCKR/152, and ΔCKR/157, but not ΔCKR/212, are efficiently associate with the GST-N+C-PLC-γ1 (Fig. 5G). We finally assessed the ability of wild-type CKR and the carboxyl terminus-deleted CKRs to bind with p85/PI3K. The result showed that ΔCKR/152 and ΔCKR/157, but not ΔCKR212, are able to associate with the p85 of PI3K (Fig. 5H). In summary, our results show that the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 influences both its ligand-dependent activation and its ability to associate with signaling proteins. Role of Carboxyl Terminus in VEGFR-2-mediated Endothelial Cell Proliferation—To determine the ability of ΔCKR/152, ΔCKR/157, and ΔCKR/212 to stimulate biological responses in endothelial cells, we subjected PAE cells expressing the truncated receptors to proliferation and differentiation assays. As presented in Fig. 6, stimulation of ΔCKR/152 and ΔCKR/157 induced cell proliferation in a CSF-1-dependent manner. However, the ability of ΔCKR/157 to stimulate cell proliferation was partially reduced. In contrast, stimulation of ΔCKR/212 resulted in no significant cell proliferation. Similarly, ΔCKR/152 and ΔCKR/157 but not ΔCKR/212 were able to induce morphological changes in PAE cells (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggest that the 57 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 are critical for its ability to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that MAPK activation is not essential for VEGFR-2-induced cell proliferation or differentiation, because ΔCKR/212 is able to stimulate MAPK activation but fails to stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation. ΔCKR/212 Acts as a Dominant-Negative Receptor—Because ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of ΔCKR/212 is severely impaired, it is highly suggestive that this receptor may act in a dominant-negative fashion when co-expressed with wild-type CKR. To this end, we tested the ability of ΔCKR/212 to attenuate the ligand-dependent phosphorylation of CKR by co-expressing ΔCKR/212 with CKR. As presented in Fig. 7A, co-expression of ΔCKR/212 with CKR significantly decreased the ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CKR. This suggests that deletion of the carboxyl tail of VEGFR-2 may serve as a means to attenuate VEGFR-2 function in pathological conditions where VEGFR-2 activity is elevated. To further understand the molecular mechanism by which carboxyl tail contributes to VEGFR-2 activation, we have co-expressed the carboxyl tail of VEGFR-2 with CKR in PAE cells (Fig. 7C). Our data show that co-expression of the carboxyl tail of VEGFR-2 with the wild-type receptor does not impair the ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CKR (Fig. 7D). This suggests that the potential interaction between the carboxyl terminus and other domains of VEGFR-2 requires the intact carboxyl terminus. The Carboxyl Tail of VEGFR-1 Rescues the Lack of Ligand-dependent Autophosphorylation of ΔCKR/212 and Its Ability to Stimulate Proliferation of Endothelial Cells—Our results demonstrate that complete deletion of the carboxyl tail abolishes the autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and its ability to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins and induce cell proliferation. To determine whether the carboxyl terminus of another VEGFR-2 family members such as VEGFR-1 (FLT-1) could be substituted for sequence in the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2, we constructed a CKR-VEGFR-1 chimera in which the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 was replaced with that of VEGFR-1 (Fig. 8A). The chimeric receptor is called CKR/cFLT-1 and was expressed in PAE cells (Fig. 8B). We used this carboxyl tail-swapped receptor and asked whether the carboxyl tail replacement could confer CKR with the ability to undergo ligand-dependent autophosphorylation and stimulate cell proliferation. As demonstrated in Fig. 8C, introducing the carboxyl tail of VEGFR-1 to ΔCKR/212 rescued the lack of ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of ΔCKR/212. The carboxyl tail-swapped receptor also was able to activate MAPK but not PLCγ1 (Fig. 8, E and G). Thus, the carboxyl tail of VEGFR-1, although able to rescue the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of ΔCKR/212, failed to stimulate activation of PLCγ1. Deletion of the entire carboxyl tail of CKR abrogated its ability to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation (Fig. 6). Thus, we addressed whether the carboxyl tail-swapped receptor (CKR-c-FLT-1) could rescue the inability of ΔCKR/212 to stimulate cell proliferation. To this end, we subjected PAE cells expressing either ΔCKR/212 or CKR-c-FLT-1 to a proliferation assay. The result demonstrates that the carboxyl tail-swapped receptor is able to stimulate proliferation of PAE cells (Fig. 9). This is consistent with the idea that the presence of carboxyl tail of VEGFR-2 is required for its full activation and its ability to stimulate biological functions. The engagement of VEGFR-2 catalytic activity by ligand stimulation initiates the intracellular signal relay and subsequent cellular responses (4.Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol.

Data presented from this report demonstrate that deletion of 212 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 severely impairs the ability of VEGFR-2 to undergo ligand-dependent autophosphorylation and to stimulate signaling proteins. Our study provides the most compelling data indicating a critical role for the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 in its ligand-dependent activation. Only 57 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 are sufficient to preserve the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 and its ability to stimulate biological responses. The recent crystal structure of VEGFR-2, although resolved without its carboxyl tail, revealed that the activation loop of VEGFR-2 is highly disordered and it is in an inhibitory “gate-close” conformation (12.McTigue M.A. Wickersham J.A. Pinko C. Showalter R.E. Parast C.V. Tempczyk-Russell A. Gehring M.R. Mroczkowski B. Kan C.C. Villafranca J.E. Appelt K. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The conformation of the activation loop of RTKs is suggested to regulate the kinase activation of RTKs by adapting either a “gate-open” or “gate-close” conformation, allowing ATP and peptide substrates to bind or not bind to it, respectively (22.Hubbard S.R.

Smith D.P. Eng C. et al.Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). This observation was rather surprising because the inhibitory conformation was only observed for RTKs in the unphosphorylated and inactive state. Interestingly, the deletion of kinase insert domain of VEGFR-2 did not change its inhibitory conformation (12.McTigue M.A. Wickersham J.A. Pinko C. Showalter R.E. Parast C.V. Tempczyk-Russell A. Gehring M.R. Mroczkowski B. Kan C.C. Villafranca J.E. Appelt K. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the unexpected conformation of the activation loop of VEGFR-2 is that other domains of VEGFR-2, such as carboxyl terminus, may regulate its conformation. Our observations demonstrate that the presence of at least 57 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 is required for full activation of VEGFR-2. However, the deletion of these 57 amino acids abolished the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2. Introducing the carboxyl terminus of another RTK, namely FLT-1/VEGFR-1, rescued the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and cell proliferation. Altogether, these observations strongly implicate the carboxyl terminus in VEGFR-2 activation. The idea that conformational changes of the activation loop of RTKs from a “gate-close” to “gate-open” state determines the autophosphorylation, and activation of RTKs is strongly supported by information obtained from the crystal structures of several RTKs including the fibroblast growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, and Src family kinases (6.Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 7.Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R.

However, new reports suggest that an increasingly intricate and complex mode of regulation may govern the kinase activation of RTKs. For instance, the recent resolution of the crystal structure of Tie-2 revealed that the activation loop is in an inhibitory conformation, and its carboxyl terminus blocks the activation loop by blocking ATP and substrate binding (10.Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar).

Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12424-12431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to affect their ligand-dependent activation. In some other cases, deletion of the carboxyl terminus of RTKs has been reported to enhance the autophosphorylation and biological responses (31.Woolford J. McAuliffe A. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 965-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32.Akiyama T. Matsuda S. Namba Y. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Mol. Cell.Biol. 1991; 11: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations strongly argue that carboxyl tails of RTKs are involved in regulation of kinase activation of RTKs. In addition to carboxyl terminus, the JM domains of RTKs have also been linked to kinase activation of RTKs. For instance, the presence JM domains of EphB2, c-kit, and Musk are required for their catalytic activation (33.Binns K.L. Taylor P.P. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Holland S.J. Mol. Cell.Biol. 2000; 20: 4791-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34.Herbst R. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35.Chan P.M. Ilangumaran S.

One possibility is that the carboxyl terminus in the unstimulated state directly interacts with the activation loop. This interaction prevents substrate binding to the activation loop and phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine sites located in the activation loop. The contribution of the carboxyl tail to kinase activation of RTKs by this mechanism has been suggested recently for Tie-2 (10.Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 36.Niu X.L. Peters K.G. Kontos C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31768-31773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (29.Bardelli A. Longati P. Williams T.A. Benvenuti S. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29274-29281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2, in particular tyrosine phosphorylation sites within this domain, may directly or indirectly modulate VEGFR-2 activation by recruiting proteins such as tyrosine phosphatases that may promote dephosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Thus, it is possible that the carboxyl terminus influences the overall tertiary structure of VEGFR-2, and lack of carboxyl terminus may interfere with adaptation of VEGFR-2 from an inhibitory “gate-close” conformation to an active “gate-open” conformation. The data presented in this study support this possibility. First, deletion of the entire carboxyl tail abolishes autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Second, introducing the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-1 with the carboxyl tail-deleted CKR (ΔCKR/212) rescued the autophosphorylation of the receptor. Thus, we propose that in the absence of ligand, VEGFR-2 monomers are inhibited by steric or intramolecular interactions between its activation loop and carboxyl terminus, shown in Fig. 10. In the presence of ligand, VEGFR-2 undergoes dimerization, resulting in conformational changes that may promote release of the carboxyl terminus from the activation loop. This follows the rearrangement of activation loop and autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2. When the carboxyl terminus is not present, the ligand-induced conformational change on the activation loop of VEGFR-2 is not sufficiently accommodated, and thus VEGFR-2 is not autophosphorylated. In summary, the data presented here demonstrate a critical role for carboxyl terminus in kinase activation and biological functions of VEGFR-2. The carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 appears to play two distinct roles: to provide binding sites for signaling proteins, and to contribute to kinase activation of VEGFR-2. Further studies, in particular resolving the crystal structure of VEGFR-2 with presence of its carboxyl terminus, will determine the mechanisms of involvement of the carboxyl terminus in kinase activation of VEGFR-2."
https://openalex.org/W2017510572,"The molecular basis of prion strain diversity is proposed to be encoded by distinct conformations of the abnormal scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc). PrPSc formation for the hyper (HY) and drowsy (DY) strains of the transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) agent was investigated using the cell-free PrP conversion reaction to determine the role of distinct PrPSc conformations in the rate of in vitro conversion of cellular PrP into protease-resistant PrP. PrP conversion increased at an exponential rate for both TME strains until peak levels were reached at 72–96 h of reaction time. The amount and rate of PrP conversion for HY TME was greater than those for DY TME between 48 h and the peak level of PrP conversion. Between 96 and 120 h, there was a negative rate of PrP conversion; and between 120 and 168 h, the net rate of HY and DY PrP conversion approached zero. These findings suggest that PrP conversion can occur in three distinct stages: an elongation phase, a depolymerization phase, and a steady-state phase. Strain-specific properties between the TME strains were identified only during the elongation phase. The steady-state phase could be disrupted by the addition of PrPSc to, or by sonication of, the cell-free PrP conversion reaction. These treatments resulted in an increase in the amount of PrP conversion that was equal to or greater than that found during the peak level of PrP conversion for both TME strains, indicating that the steady-state phase was in dynamic equilibrium. In a related study, the rate of accumulation of HY and DY PrPSc in hamster brain exhibited a strain-specific pattern that had similarities to the strain-specific PrP conversion reaction during the elongation phase. These results suggest that strain-specific conformations of PrPSc have the ability to influence the rate of additional PrPSc formation from cellular PrP both in vitro and in vivo."

Cap binding is a simple one-step mechanism with very fast association rate constant (∼10<sup>7</sup>m<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). Moreover, the pH dependence on the association rate constant of m<sup>7</sup>G binding indicates that only the positively charged keto tautomer of the cap is recognized and bound.

S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is one of a small group of decarboxylases that use a covalently attached pyruvoyl group rather than pyridoxal phosphate to form a Schiff base with the substrate during catalysis (4.van Poelje P.D.

The pyruvoyl-containing enzymes are initially synthesized as proenzymes that self-cleave at an internal serine residue to yield two polypeptides, one of which (designated the α subunit) has the serine transmogrified into a pyruvoyl group at the new N terminus, a reaction in which the formation of an ester intermediate is analogous to intein processing (6.Noren C.J.

A remarkable feature of AdoMetDC is that the enzyme from all studied eucarya, bacteria, and Archaea contains the pyruvoyl cofactor, whereas for other decarboxylases for which pyruvoyl-containing enzymes are known there are often pyridoxal-dependent enzymes with the same function (4.van Poelje P.D.

Three distinct classes of AdoMetDC have been described, with little sequence similarity among them. The enzymes from eucarya are well conserved within this kingdom and are typically composed of ∼8-kDa (β) and 32-kDa (α) polypeptides; in some organisms these associate to an (αβ)2 heterotetramer, whereas in others the functional form is the αβ heterodimer. Many eucaryotic AdoMet decarboxylases are activated by the polyamine putrescine, which is a substrate for the next metabolic reaction that uses decarboxylated AdoMet (dcAdoMet) as an alkyl group donor to synthesize spermidine (12.Tabor C.W.

Less is known about the structure or mechanism of this protein; in particular, the role of the Mg2+ has not been elucidated. The third class is a metal-free, activator-independent enzyme recently described in the Archaea Methanococcus jannaschii and the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis (24.Kim A.D. Graham D.E. Seeholzer S.H. Markham G.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25.Sekowska A. Coppee J.Y. Le Caer J.P. Martin-Verstraete I. Danchin A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This protein has an (αβ)2 composition with subunit sizes of 61 and 63 residues (6.9 and 7.0 kDa, respectively) in M. jannaschii and subunits of comparable size in its homologs. A phylogenetic analysis showed that although this third class is the only type present in archaeal genomes, representatives are also found in many bacteria including the human pathogens Bacillus anthracis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.Kim A.D. Graham D.E. Seeholzer S.H. Markham G.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In light of the established importance of polyamines in cell growth, this class may represent a newly identified target for the design of anti-bacterial agents. In the present study, we have undertaken an investigation of the functional properties of the M. jannaschii enzyme with the goals of understanding the catalytic process of this small enzyme and of identifying additional distinguishing properties for use in the design of selective inhibitors. Reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Purified decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine was a gift from Dr. David Anton, DuPont. Improving the Expression of M. jannaschii AdoMetDC in E. coli— E. coli strain AMJAZ62, which contains the M. jannaschii AdoMetDC gene (MJ0315) cloned into pUC18, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection as part of the collection from The Institute for Genome Research. The M. jannaschii DNA fragment cloned in this plasmid encodes the complete MJ0315 gene flanked by parts of the coding regions of the adjacent MJ0314 and MJ0316 genes (24.Kim A.D. Graham D.E. Seeholzer S.H. Markham G.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The MJ0315 gene was subcloned into pET3a using NdeI and BamHI sites that were created by PCR at the start and end of the coding region, respectively. The DNA sequence confirmed that the desired coding region was obtained, and the mass spectrum of the purified protein showed the same ions reported previously (24.Kim A.D. Graham D.E. Seeholzer S.H. Markham G.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This plasmid, denoted pMJDCase-1, was transformed into strain BL21(DE3)-(codon-plus-RIL) (Stratagene) for protein purification. The MJ0315 gene has numerous codons for arginine and isoleucine that are rare in E. coli, and the additional tRNAs, provided by the Codon Plus system, were found to substantially increase the protein yield. AdoMetDC Purification—A small culture of BL21(DE3)-(codon-plus-RIL)pMJDCase-1 was grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Larger cultures of LB media were then inoculated with 1:20 dilution (v/v) of the overnight culture and grown at 37 °C for 4 h. Induction of AdoMetDC expression was obtained by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-(β-d-galactopyranoside) followed by growth for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until use. The steps below reflect a preparation from 30 g (wet weight) of cells. The cell pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 30 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8, using 10 ml of buffer/g (wet weight) of cells. The cells were lysed by one pass through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 20% saturation, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was then added to the supernatant to 80% saturation, and the pellet was collected by centrifugation. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in ∼50 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 8, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the same buffer. The protein was divided into ∼5-ml portions and heated in a 70 °C water bath for 30 min. Precipitated materials were removed by centrifugation. Chromatographic steps were performed at room temperature. The sample was loaded onto a 2.5 × 25-cm column of DEAE-52 anion exchange resin (Whatman) that was equilibrated with buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 8. The column was washed with 200 ml of starting buffer (at a flow rate of 4 ml/min) and eluted with a 1-liter gradient from the same buffer to a final buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 m KCl, pH 8. The fractions containing activity were collected and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7. The protein was then loaded onto a ceramic hydroxylapatite (Type I, 200 μm, Bio-Rad) column (2.5 × 15 cm) and washed with 200 ml of 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The protein was eluted with a 500-ml gradient from the wash buffer to the same buffer containing 0.5 m phosphate. Final purification was obtained by gel filtration chromatography on a 2.6 × 100-cm Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated and eluted at 0.75 ml/min with 50 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5. The final protein displayed a single band after native electrophoresis on a 8–25% gradient polyacrylamide Phast gel that was stained with Coomassie Blue (Amersham Biosciences). The very small size of the two subunits results in protein bands that run near the front even on high density SDS gels (Amersham Biosciences), and the proteins stain poorly, rendering this an insensitive method. The overall protein yield was 8 mg of protein/g of cells. Protein concentrations were calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 12330 m–1 cm–1 as calculated by the program PeptideSort (26.Genetics Computer GroupPeptideSort. Version, 10.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison WI1999Google Scholar). Kinetic Analyses of AdoMetDC Activity—AdoMetDC activity was assayed either by measuring the production of 14CO2 from [carboxy-14C]AdoMet (Moravek Biochemicals) (24.Kim A.D. Graham D.E. Seeholzer S.H. Markham G.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or by HPLC analysis. Routine reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Hepes-KOH, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, in a volume of 100 μl. Reactions using [carboxy-14C]AdoMet were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 4N HCl to sealed reaction vials containing Ba(OH)2-soaked filters in the caps; after the samples were shaken for 30 min the 14CO2 was determined by scintillation counting of the filters. For HPLC analysis the reactions were terminated by the addition of 25 μl 1.6 n of HClO4. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min. Substrate and product were quantified by cation exchange HPLC on a VYDAC 400VHP575P column (0.75 × 5 cm) eluted with an ammonium formate buffer containing NH4OH (33.5 ml of NH4OH in 1 liter of H2O, pH 4.2 adjusted with HCOOH). AdoMet was eluted by washing for 2 min at 1.75 ml/min with 5% buffer, 95% H2O (v/v), and then the eluant was changed to 70% buffer, 30% H2O; decarboxylated-AdoMet eluted after 10 min. The HPLC system consisted of a Waters 600E equipped with Waters 994 programmable photodiode array detector. The integrated peak areas for AdoMet and dcAdoMet were determined at 260 nm, and the data were analyzed to obtain the relative amounts of the remaining substrate and the product. To determine the kinetic parameters, kcat and Km initial velocities were measured for at least five AdoMet concentrations. Product formation was linear with time under the conditions used. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and kinetic parameters were calculated using the Levenberg-Marquardt method of nonlinear least squares regression using equal weighting in the kinetics module of SigmaPlot (SigmaPlot 2000, SPSS Science). The pH dependencies of the reaction rates were analyzed using the equation, υobserved=υmaximal/(1+10(pKa-pH))+10(pH-pKb))+υpH-independent because the observed rates approach a non-zero limiting value at the limiting pH values compatible with protein and substrate stability. Kinetic studies in D2O were performed at room temperature as described above except that the reaction solutions contained 90% D2O. Solutions for solvent deuterium isotope effect measurements were prepared from a stock solution of buffer that was dried and redissolved in D2O; this method maintains a constant ratio of acidic and basic buffer components and, thus, an equivalent pL (L = H or D) (27.Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Rates were measured at pL of 7.5 and 8.0, and no differences in kinetic isotope effects were found. The kinetic isotope effects were determined by fitting data in H2O and D2O using the VVKISOT program (28.Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1967; 29: 1-32PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature and pH Effects on AdoMetDC Activity—AdoMetDC activity of the purified enzyme was studied by varying reaction conditions including temperature and pH. Effects of temperature on AdoMetDC activity were analyzed by HPLC analyses. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to reaction mixtures that were preequilibrated at various temperatures from 15 to 90 °C; solutions contained 50 mm Hepes-KOH, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Care was taken to ensure substrate saturation at each temperature. The pH of the reaction solutions did not vary significantly over the range studied. The influence of pH on AdoMetDC activity was carried out in 50 mm buffer (Mes, pH 4.4–6.8; Hepes, pH 7.0–9.0; Ches and Hepes, pH 9.5–10.0) and 5 mm EDTA; the pH was adjusted by the addition of KOH as required. The 14CO2 production assay was used. Inhibitors of AdoMetDC Activity—Compounds tested as inhibitors included the product decarboxylated-AdoMet, the classic AdoMet decarboxylase inhibitor methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) (29.Williams-Ashman H.G. Schenone A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), l-methionine, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, S-methyl-l-methionine, and sinefungin, a natural product AdoMet analog in which the S+-CH3 is replaced by a CH-NH3+ group. Survey inhibition studies were conducted with an AdoMet concentration near the Km value of 95 μm. The effect of pH on inhibition by MGBG and decarboxylated-AdoMet was studied by variation of both AdoMet and inhibitor concentrations at each pH value. Data were evaluated using the kinetics module of Sigmaplot 2000 (SPSS Science). Substrate-mediated Inactivation—The possibility of substrate-mediated inactivation was measured by incubating AdoMetDC with or without 0.5 mm AdoMet at room temperature for various time periods (15–60 min) in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, 5 mm EDTA, at either pH 7.5 or 9. After preincubation, [carboxy-14C]AdoMet was added to the mixtures, and the enzyme activity was measured in the standard CO2 formation assay. The same conditions with the addition of 0.1 m NaCNBH3 were used for Schiff base trapping experiments. After incubation the samples were mixed with an equal volume of 20 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry on a Bruker instrument. NMR Studies—1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DRX-300 spectrometer operating at 300 MHz. Data were collected at 25 °C using a standard one-pulse sequence. UV Spectroscopic Studies—UV spectra were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 instrument with a resolution of 1 nm. Spectra were obtained with a 30-s integration time to reduce noise. Spectra of the free enzyme and free MGBG were subtracted from the spectrum of the E plus MGBG mixture to reveal the spectral perturbations on complex formation. Solutions contained 100 μm (αβ) protein and various concentrations of MGBG between 25 and 600 μm in 25 mm Tris-Cl, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.5. The decrease in absorbance at 325 nm between the protein plus MGBG sample and a control of MGBG in buffer reflected the amount of bound MGBG. The binding stoichiometry was calculated assuming the same change in extinction coefficient upon deprotonation in solution and in the protein complex (Δϵ = 33.5 mm–1 cm–1 at 325 nm) (30.Baiocchi F. Cheng C.C. Haggerty W.J. Lewis L.R. Liao T.K. Nyberg W.H. O'Brien D.E. Podrebarac E.G. J. Med. Chem. 1963; 6: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The data were fit to a single binding site model using the program Enzfitter (Elsevier-Biosoft). Steady State Kinetic Studies of AdoMetDC—Initial reaction rates for AdoMet decarboxylation were determined either from measurements of 14CO2 released at various [carboxy-14C]AdoMet concentrations or from integrated areas of HPLC chromatograms that separated AdoMet and dcAdoMet; the methods gave the same results. At pH 7.5 and 22 °C, kinetic parameters were Km = 95 μm and Vmax = 37 nmol/mg-min, corresponding to a turnover number (kcat) of 0.0075 s–1 and a kcat/Km of 78 m–1 s–1. Fig. 1 illustrates an Arrhenius plot of the temperature dependence of kcat for AdoMetDC. The turnover number increased ∼30-fold when temperature was increased from 22 to 70 °C, whereas the Km increased 3-fold. An Arrhenius plot of kcat at pH 7.5 was linear from 15 to 90 °C and showed an activation energy of 13.0 kcal/mol, corresponding to ΔG† = 17.3 kcal/mol, ΔH† = 12.3 kcal/mol, and ΔS† = –16.2 entropy units. The lack of curvature of the Arrhenius plot suggests a common rate-limiting step over this temperature range and the absence of a significant heat capacity of activation, implying that a large protein conformational change does not accompany the reaction (31.Somero G.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 43-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Several compounds were tested as potential inhibitors of AdoMetDC in the presence of AdoMet at a concentration corresponding to its Km value. No inhibition was observed with 4 mm S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, 10 mm l-methionine, 25 mm S-methyl-l-methionine, or 20 mm sinefungin. Inhibition by the product dcAdoMet and by methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) is described below. pH Dependence—The pH dependence of the reaction rate was characterized at 22 °C. The pH-rate profiles shown in Fig. 2 are bell-shaped for both kcat and kcat/Km, but the rates approached non-zero limiting values, as is particularly apparent for kcat/Km. The kcat profile showed pK values for a group that must be deprotonated, with a pKa of 5.3 ± 0.1, and a group that must be protonated, with a pKb of 8.2 ± 0.1; a limiting pH-independent rate was ∼2% of the maximal rate (Fig. 2A). The kcat profile reflects the ionization states of acidic and basic groups that are required for the enzyme-AdoMet complex to form products with maximal efficiency. The pH dependence of kcat/Km slopes in the pH 5.5–9 region revealed a pKa value of 6.5 ± 0.3 and a pKb value of 8.3 ± 0.3 (Fig. 2B); this pH profile reflects the ionization of the free enzyme and free AdoMet as well as the enzyme-AdoMet complex. These pK values are not closely related to that of the substrate (the only AdoMet ionization in this range is that of the amino group, which is 7.8 (32.Mudd S.H. Klee W.A. Ross P.D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)), and thus, these ionizations reflect groups on the protein. The unit slopes in the pH 5.5–9 region of both the kcat and kcat/Km profiles reflect the involvement of single acidic and basic groups. The pK near 8.2 is in the normal range of a cysteine sulfhydryl in peptides (33.Bulaj G. Kortemme T. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8965-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). By analogy to previous studies of eucaryotic AdoMetDC, this pK likely reflects the ionization of cysteine in the conserved Thr-Cys-Gly sequence located 19 residues C-terminal to the pyruvoyl group in the M. jannaschii protein and in similar locations in all other characterized AdoMet decarboxylases (17.Xiong H. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34.Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The tendency of kcat/Km to approach limiting values at the pH extremes emphasizes decreases in the Km value; because the Km is a complex kinetic constant, the molecular origin of this decrease is unclear at present. The kcat/Km value approaches a limiting value of ∼7% of the maximal rate at high pH and tends toward value near 2% of the maximal rate at the low pH extreme. It is noteworthy that site-directed mutagenesis studies of the eucaryotic AdoMetDC have found residual activity after the removal of candidate acid/base catalytic groups, suggesting that the groups required for maximal activity are not absolutely essential for catalysis (17.Xiong H. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34.Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). The product dcAdoMet was a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet; thus, product release is either random or CO2 is released first (Fig. 3A). The pH dependence of inhibition by dcAdoMet was determined in the range of 6.0–10.0 (Fig. 3B); the Ki increased substantially below pH 6.8 but did not significantly vary between pH 8 and 10. The Ki increase at low pH may reflect the same enzyme group that has a pK of 6.5 in the kcat/Km profile. The pH dependence does not reflect the ionization of the amino group of dcAdoMet, which was determined to have a pK of 9.2 from the pH dependence of the 1H NMR resonances of the α protons. Inhibition by MGBG—MGBG (the structure is illustrated in Fig. 4A) is a well characterized inhibitor of AdoMet decarboxylases (35.Janne J. Alhonen-Hongisto L. Nikula P. Elo H. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1985; 24: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). MGBG has been the parent of a multitude of analogs that have been prepared in searches for compounds of increased efficacy as cancer chemotherapeutic agents (36.Regenass U. Mett H. Stanek J. Mueller M. Kramer D. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3210-3217PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Stanek J. Caravatti G. Frei J. Furet P. Mett H. Schneider P. Regenass U. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 2168-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immobilized MGBG has been commonly used for affinity chromatographic purification of the enzymes (38.Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 581-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and was used for the initial purification of the M. jannaschii enzyme (24.Kim A.D. Graham D.E. Seeholzer S.H. Markham G.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MGBG has a pK of 7.9, above which the compound displays a bright yellow color with an absorption maximum at 325 nm. A neutron diffraction study of the colorless MGBG·2HCl crystals showed that the dication is protonated on all four of the terminal nitrogens (39.Hamilton W.C. La Placa S.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1968; 24: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Presumably, one of these terminal NH2+ groups loses a proton with a pK of 7.9, creating an extended conjugated structure that absorbs at 325 nm. MGBG is a competitive inhibitor of M. jannaschii AdoMetDC with a Ki of 25 μm. The Ki did not vary in the pH range from 6.5 to 9.0 but decreased ∼2-fold at pH 6.0. To probe the ionization state of MGBG bound to AdoMetDC, the perturbation of the UV spectrum upon formation of the enzyme-MGBG complex was determined by difference spectroscopy (Fig. 3B). Upon complex formation at pH 7.5 the 325 nm absorption of the +1 ionization state disappears, indicating that MGBG is bound as the dication. The difference in 325 nm absor"
