https://openalex.org/W2096452841,"The psychological principles that govern the perception of decision problems and the evaluation of probabilities and outcomes produce predictable shifts of preference when the same problem is framed in different ways. Reversals of preference are demonstrated in choices regarding monetary outcomes, both hypothetical and real, and in questions pertaining to the loss of human lives. The effects of frames on preferences are compared to the effects of perspectives on perceptual appearance. The dependence of preferences on the formulation of decision problems is a significant concern for the theory of rational choice."

Predictions of sex ratio alteration as a function of environmental change are tested in laboratory experiments with two parasitic wasps. Field data from a variety of other organisms also support the model. Finally, we discuss possibilities and difficulties for testing this type of evolutionary model."

In contrast to saline-treated controls, naloxone treatment significantly improved the hypotension observed after cervical spinal injury. More critically, naloxone therapy significantly improved neurologic recovery. These findings implicate endorphins in the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury and indicate that narcotic antagonists may have a therapeutic role in this condition."

https://openalex.org/W1484819445,"A 43-residue peptide analog of tropomyosin Ac-AB4C-OH (A = Lys-Cys-Ala-Glu-Leu-Glu-Gly, B = Lys-Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly, C = Lys-Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly-Lys) was synthesized. The 86-residue disulfide-linked dimer was prepared by air oxidation of the single cysteine residue in the NH2-terminal Fragment A of the 43-residue peptide to provide a two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil of defined molecular weight with the chains in-register and parallel. The physical properties of the 86-residue dimer were determined and compared to CM-tropomyosin and sequential polyheptapeptides. The stabilizing effect of the disulfide bridge in the synthetic dimer was indicated by the shift in the transition of the thermal unfolding profile (t 1/2) of +6.5 degrees C from 72.5 degrees C for the reduced sample to 79 degrees C for the oxidized sample. The 86-residue disulfide-linked dimer maintains 65% of the original helicity at 65 degrees C, and the polyheptapeptide [Leu-Glu-Serr-Leu-Glu-Ser-Lys]n of 9,500 daltons in denaturant maintains 75% helicity at 65 degrees C, whereas CM-tropomyosin is completely denatured at this temperature. These results show a shift in the transition of the thermal unfolding profile (t 1/2) of greater than 39 degrees C for the above two synthetic peptides relative to CM-tropomyosin. The polyheptapeptide [Leu-Glu-Ser-Leu-Glu-Ser-Lys]n maintains 95% of the original helicity in 3 M urea, whereas 50% remains in CM-tropomyosin. Comparison of the CD spectra of three polyheptapeptides, [Leu-Glu-Ser-Leu-Glu-Ser-Lys]n, [Ala-Glu-Ser-Leu-Glu-Ser-Lys]n, and [Ala-Glu-Ser-Ala-Glu-Ser-Lys]n showed that the ellipticities increased as the size of the hydrophobic side chains increased in the positions responsible for the formation and stabilization of the coiled-coil. That substituting residues in the outer positions of the coiled-coil can affect alpha-helix stabilization is shown by comparing the CD spectra of three polymers [Leu-Glu-Ser-Leu-Glu-Ser-Lys]n, [Leu-Glu-Ser(Ac)-Leu-Glu-Ser(Ac)-Lys]n, and [Leu-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Ala-Lys]n."

https://openalex.org/W2010175053,"Seventy-three percent of all exposed common coral reef invertebrates, from four phyla (42 species) tested, are toxic to fish. This represents the first evidence of the high incidence to toxicity in the marine tropics among several phyletic groups comprising dominant species. Most of the remaining exposed species have structural defense mechanisms against predation by fish. Of cryptic invertebrates, 25 percent are toxic to fish. The relation between toxicity, fish feeding behavior, community structure, and evolutionary theory is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2005951576,"Aversive associative learning in Aplysia california survives restraint of the animal and surgical exposure of the central nervous system. The learning is expressed in the intracellularly recorded activity of identified motor neurons mediating three different defensive behaviors: escape locomotion, inking, and siphon withdrawal. In each case, animals that had previously received paired training showed significant facilitation of synaptic input to motor neurons during test stimulation in the presence of the conditioned stimulus. Animals without such training showed no facilitation of input to the motor neurons. Resting potential and input resistance appeared unaffected by conditioning and were not altered by application of the conditioned stimulus. These results show that the conditioned facilitation of defensive responses cannot be explained by subthreshold actions of the conditioned stimulus on the motor neurons and support the hypothesis that Aplysia learn to associate the conditioned stimulus with a fearlike central state."

https://openalex.org/W1987227850,"Growth of mouse lymphoma L5178Y, which contains large quantitites of the gangliotriosylceramide (GgOs3Cer), in DBA/2 mice was suppressed by passive immunization with monoclonal immunoglobulin G3 antibodies to GgOS3Cer, but not by immunoglobulin M antibodies with or without added complement. Most groups of mice treated with monoclonal immunoglobulin G3 antibodies did not develop tumors, but the tumor that appeared in a treated animal had a much lower amount of the GgOS3Cer than the cells used for inoculation. Thus, passive immunization either prevented growth of the lymphoma or caused selection of a variant with a lower quantity of the antigen GgOS3Cer."
https://openalex.org/W1512778456,"The dimer-tetramer equilibrium constants of human oxyhemoglobin (4K2) and deoxyhemoglobin (0K2) have been determined at 21.5 degrees C as a function of pH and chloride concentration. In buffers containing 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, the apparent numbers of protons released upon assembly of dimers into tetramers were determined from the pH dependencies of 4K2 and 0K2. At pH 7.4, the assembly of unliganded tetramers is accompanied by the absorption of 0.9 +/- 0.1 mol of H+. For assenbly of oxyhemoglobin, there are 0.8 +/- 0.1 mol of H+ released per mol of tetramer formed. From these results and the value of 2.1 mol of H+/402 for the tetramer Bohr effect, a Bohr effect for dimers is determined as 0.2 +/- .08 mol of H+ released upon binding 2 mol of 02. Thus, the dimer Bohr effect is approximately 20% as large as the tetramer Bohr effect. At pH 7.4, the value of 0K2 is insensitive to [Cl-], whereas 4K2 varies inversely with [Cl-]. At pH 8.95, both 4K2 and 0K2 decrease with increasing [Cl-]. These and previous results indicate that salt bridges are not the dominant energetic factor in stabilizing the deoxy quaternary structure of hemoglobin. In buffer conditions of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, we estimate 1.8 mol of Cl- bound upon dissociation of 1 mol of oxy tetramers into oxy dimers, whereas the deoxy molecules dissociate without any change in bound chloride. From the [Cl-] dependence of oxygenation curves, we estimate 1.8 mol of [Cl-] released upon binding 4 mol of O2 to tetramers. Thus, oxygenation of dimers at pH 7.4 apparently involves no change in bound chloride."

https://openalex.org/W2052693038,"Arsenic concentrates in the kidneys of the giant clams of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The highest concentrations measured were 1004 parts per million, of which most, 2066 parts per million, were in the water-soluble fraction containing trimethylarsoniumlactate and its derivatives. This accumulation is ascribed to a mechanism in which oceanic arsenate is assimilated by symbiotic zooxanthellae and subsequently deposited in host tissues. The gills are the major site of arsenic excretion by these animals. Gill membrane arsenolipids mediate exposure of their trimethylarsonium groups to the sea and its biological oxidative activities."

https://openalex.org/W2006937791,"Sheep increased their water intake in proportion to the amount of protein-free, isosmotic fluid that was removed from their blood by ultrafiltration. This behavioral response to hypovolemia was eliminated by crushing the left atrial appendage of the heart. The surgical maneuver had no effect on basal water intake or on the drinking response to a salt load. These findings suggest that left atrial stretch receptors, which influence secretion of antidiuretic hormone when stimulated, may also play an important role in mediating thirst during hypovolemia."

https://openalex.org/W1497254776,"Quantitative determination of tissue levels of metallothionein was performed using differential pulse polarographic analysis. Cadmium induction of mouse hepatic metallothionein was observed to be linear with respect to dose until a sharp saturation maximum was reached. This metal-stimulated synthesis was completely inhibited by actinomycin D. It was found that a 2- and 7-fold molar excess of copper and zinc, respectively, was necessary to induce hepatic metallothionein synthesis equivalent to a single dose of cadmium. Although liver was the most dynamic tissue in terms of synthetic production, the intestine had the highest basal level. However, induction in the latter tissue was greatly decreased relative to liver or kidney, with no measurable synthesis after a single metal dose. Induction kinetics was similar for all inducing metals with the exception of cadmium-induced hepatic protein, which remained unchanged for 2 weeks and decayed with an apparent t 1/2 of 32 days. Furthermore, with the exception of intravenous zinc dosing, which elicited no hepatic biosynthesis, initial induction kinetics was invariant with administration route. It was observed that chronic subcutaneous administration of sufficient cadmium to saturate hepatic metallothionein synthesis resulted in a coincident onset of toxic symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W1598729839,"The action of ricin toxin was stimulated by addition of methylamine or some other amines, as shown by measuring the inhibition of protein synthesis of cultured cells by the toxin. Under the same conditions, however, the action of diphtheria toxin was completely inhibited by the amines. In a cell-free protein-synthesizing system, methylamine had no effect on the action of the A chain of ricin toxin and fragment A of diphtheria toxin. Studies on the interactions of 125I-labeled toxins with cells revealed that methylamine did not alter toxin-receptor bindings, but affected the entry of the toxins into the cells. Studies were also made on the effects of methylamine on the actions of two hybrid toxins, formed from a subunit of Wistaria floribunda lectin and fragment A of diphtheria toxin and the A chain of ricin toxin, respectively. Results suggested that the processes of entry of ricin toxin and diphtheria toxin, or at least parts of these processes, are different."
https://openalex.org/W1591723582,"Cytochalasin B inhibits phytomitogen-induced human lymphocyte proliferation with a Ki of approximately 6 X 10(-6) M. Cytochalasins A, C, D, E, and H are also inhibitory with varying degrees of potency, whereas cytochalasin G and chaetoglobosins A, B, C, E, F, and J are not at concentrations as high as 15 microM. Cytochalasin B also competitively inhibits carrier-mediated equilibrium exchange of hexose (Ki of approximately 7 X 10(-7) M), but cytochalasin E is ineffective. Cytochalasin B binds reversibly to the lymphocyte at three distinct sites: L, M, and H. The ligand binding at L site shows the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 1 to 3 X 10(-6) M and total binding sites (Bt) of 6 to 8 X 10(7)/cell, represents approximately 85% of the total saturable binding, displays a broad specificity interacting with cytochalasins C, D, and E, is not displaceable by D-glucose, is located mostly in a cytosol fraction, and exists in intimate relation to cytoskeletal actin. M site shows a Kd of 2 to 4 X 10(-7) M and Bt of 5 to 8 X 10(6)/cell, represents about 8% of the total saturable binding, shows stringent specificity not being displaced by cytochalasins C, D, and E, is competitively displaced by D-glucose and phloretin, and is quantitatively recoverable in the plasma membrane fraction. The binding to H site shows a Kd of 0.5 to 1.0 X 10(-7) M and Bt of 4 to 5 X 10(6)/cell, representing approximately 7% of the total saturable binding, shows a broad specificity, is insensitive to D-glucose, and is membrane bound. It is proposed that L site is actin and is involved in the inhibition of lymphocyte mitogenesis, whereas M site is associated with the hexose transport carrier. Structure-activity relationships of cytochalasin effects are also discussed."

Densities were determined from the density numbers generated by computerized tomography at three levels of the brain-the highest level of the lateral ventricles and the next two higher levels-with adjustments made to control for possible artifacts in the data. The advantage of the dominant hemisphere over the nondominant hemisphere was lessened in alcoholics.

https://openalex.org/W1504754828,"Intermediate filaments (IF) were prepared under identical conditions from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), baby hamster kidney (BHK), and primary mouse epidermal cells. CHO and BHK cells each have a major IF protein (Mr = 55,000); these proteins comigrate on two-dimensional gels. BHK cells have an additional protein constituent (Mr = 54,000) which is absent from CHO. The IF preparation from the epidermal cells was considerably more complex, containing at least five proteins with molecular weights between 50,000 and 70,000, none of which has a mobility similar to the CHO protein. If assembled in vitro from crude CHO IF preparations were morphologically indistinguishable from filaments assembled from other cell types. Analysis of these in vitro polymerized filaments from CHO cells using circular dichroism and wide angle x-ray diffraction revealed that the CHO filaments were structurally similar to filaments prepared from BHK or epidermal cells. The Mr = 55,000 proteins from CHO and BHK cells were found to have identical one- and two-dimensional peptide maps, demonstrating that their amino acid sequences must be very similar. These studies indicate that CHO cells possess the simplest system thus far described for studying the assembly of intermediate filaments."

https://openalex.org/W1525539543,"In the course of a study in protease-controlled peptide synthesis, several promising pathways to synthetic enkephalins had to be discarded or modified because they failed to give the required products. Partial deprotection of peptide fragments prior to chain elongation resulted in an enhanced susceptibility of scissile bonds to proteolysis. The use of proteases, the specificity of which was not confined solely to the bond to be synthesized, thus led to a priori cleavage of pre-existing peptide bonds. Subsequently, enzyme-mediated synthesis of new peptide bonds between initial reactants and nascent degradation products furnished undesired, often truncated peptides. A detailed characterization of the undesired products gave information as to whether or not the peptide bonds were susceptible to proteolytic cleavage or accessible via enzymatic synthesis. In this way, the unexpected outcome of protease catalysis led to working predictions regarding enzyme-mediated peptide bond formation, and thus, finally contributed to the successful synthesis of the target peptides."

https://openalex.org/W2053682086,"In frog ventricle, developed tension was markedly larger in response to depolarization caused by a voltage clamp step than to depolarization induced by high concentrations of potassium chloride. Measurement of extracellular potassium activity at the surface and at the depth of muscle during the development of contractures showed that the diffusion of potassium is much slower than the spread of depolarization through the cross section of muscle. These two observations suggest that competition between the depolarizing and the negative inotropic effects of an increase in the extracellular potassium ion concentration may determine the time course and magnitude of contractile tension in heart muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1568884371,"Mouse brain glutamate decarboxylase(s) was specifically titrated in vivo and in crude brain homogenates by a combination of gabaculine and [alpha-3H]acetylenic gamma-aminobutyric acid. This specific titration is based on the differential spectra of action of these two mechanism-based enzyme inactivators. The specificity of the titration in vitro was demonstrated by showing that the time course of radioactivity incorporation exactly paralleled the time course for glutamate of decarboxylase inactivation. Furthermore, pretreatment of the crude homogenate with aminooxyacetic acid and alpha-methyl-trans-3-dehydroglutamate, two inactivators of glutamate decarboxylase which function by entirely different mechanisms, decreased count incorporation ([alpha-3H]acetylenic gamma-aminobutyric acid) to the same extent as the activity was decreased. Injection of [alpha-3H]acetylenic gamma-aminobutyric acid intraperitoneally after gabaculine injection led to incorporation of 0.46 nmol of inactivator/mouse brain, when approximatley 70% of the enzyme was inactivated. This means that there is approximately 0.66 nmol of glutamate decarboxylase/0.5 g of mouse brain, assuming the stoichiometry of inactivator bound to enzyme is one. This value is similar to the one (0.646 nmol) obtained from a calculation based on the enzyme purification data (Wu, J.-Y. (1974) in gamma-Aminobutyric Acid in Nervous System Function (Roberts, E., Chase, E. N., and Tower, D. B., eds) pp. 7-55, Raven Press, New York)."
