https://openalex.org/W2804257223,"Autophagy increases the lifespan of model organisms; however, its role in promoting mammalian longevity is less well-established1,2. Here we report lifespan and healthspan extension in a mouse model with increased basal autophagy. To determine the effects of constitutively increased autophagy on mammalian health, we generated targeted mutant mice with a Phe121Ala mutation in beclin 1 (Becn1F121A/F121A) that decreases its interaction with the negative regulator BCL2. We demonstrate that the interaction between beclin 1 and BCL2 is disrupted in several tissues in Becn1 F121A/F121A knock-in mice in association with higher levels of basal autophagic flux. Compared to wild-type littermates, the lifespan of both male and female knock-in mice is significantly increased. The healthspan of the knock-in mice also improves, as phenotypes such as age-related renal and cardiac pathological changes and spontaneous tumorigenesis are diminished. Moreover, mice deficient in the anti-ageing protein klotho 3 have increased beclin 1 and BCL2 interaction and decreased autophagy. These phenotypes, along with premature lethality and infertility, are rescued by the beclin 1(F121A) mutation. Together, our data demonstrate that disruption of the beclin 1–BCL2 complex is an effective mechanism to increase autophagy, prevent premature ageing, improve healthspan and promote longevity in mammals. A knock-in mutation in beclin 1 that increases autophagy in mice extends animal lifespan, improves healthspan, and also rescues early lethality in mice deficient in the anti-ageing protein klotho."
https://openalex.org/W2804270751,"Hyperphosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1 subunit of human RNA polymerase (Pol) II is essential for transcriptional elongation and mRNA processing1-3. The CTD contains 52 heptapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. The highly repetitive nature and abundant possible phosphorylation sites of the CTD exert special constraints on the kinases that catalyse its hyperphosphorylation. Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)-which consists of CDK9 and cyclin T1-is known to hyperphosphorylate the CTD and negative elongation factors to stimulate Pol II elongation1,4,5. The sequence determinant on P-TEFb that facilitates this action is currently unknown. Here we identify a histidine-rich domain in cyclin T1 that promotes the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD and stimulation of transcription by CDK9. The histidine-rich domain markedly enhances the binding of P-TEFb to the CTD and functional engagement with target genes in cells. In addition to cyclin T1, at least one other kinase-DYRK1A 6 -also uses a histidine-rich domain to target and hyperphosphorylate the CTD. As a low-complexity domain, the histidine-rich domain also promotes the formation of phase-separated liquid droplets in vitro, and the localization of P-TEFb to nuclear speckles that display dynamic liquid properties and are sensitive to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions. The CTD-which in isolation does not phase separate, despite being a low-complexity domain-is trapped within the cyclin T1 droplets, and this process is enhanced upon pre-phosphorylation by CDK7 of transcription initiation factor TFIIH1-3. By using multivalent interactions to create a phase-separated functional compartment, the histidine-rich domain in kinases targets the CTD into this environment to ensure hyperphosphorylation and efficient elongation of Pol II."

https://openalex.org/W2804178337,"Graphene, a single-layer network of carbon atoms, has outstanding electrical and mechanical properties 1 . Graphene ribbons with nanometre-scale widths2,3 (nanoribbons) should exhibit half-metallicity 4 and quantum confinement. Magnetic edges in graphene nanoribbons5,6 have been studied extensively from a theoretical standpoint because their coherent manipulation would be a milestone for spintronic 7 and quantum computing devices 8 . However, experimental investigations have been hampered because nanoribbon edges cannot be produced with atomic precision and the graphene terminations that have been proposed are chemically unstable 9 . Here we address both of these problems, by using molecular graphene nanoribbons functionalized with stable spin-bearing radical groups. We observe the predicted delocalized magnetic edge states and test theoretical models of the spin dynamics and spin-environment interactions. Comparison with a non-graphitized reference material enables us to clearly identify the characteristic behaviour of the radical-functionalized graphene nanoribbons. We quantify the parameters of spin-orbit coupling, define the interaction patterns and determine the spin decoherence channels. Even without any optimization, the spin coherence time is in the range of microseconds at room temperature, and we perform quantum inversion operations between edge and radical spins. Our approach provides a way of testing the theory of magnetism in graphene nanoribbons experimentally. The coherence times that we observe open up encouraging prospects for the use of magnetic nanoribbons in quantum spintronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W3106442982,"The dynamics of our Universe is strongly influenced by pervasive-albeit elusive-dark matter, with a total mass about five times the mass of all the baryons1,2. Despite this, its origin and composition remain a mystery. All evidence for dark matter relies on its gravitational pull on baryons, and thus such evidence does not require any non-gravitational coupling between baryons and dark matter. Nonetheless, some small coupling would explain the comparable cosmic abundances of dark matter and baryons 3 , as well as solving structure-formation puzzles in the pure cold-dark-matter models 4 . A vast array of observations has been unable to find conclusive evidence for any non-gravitational interactions of baryons with dark matter5-9. Recent observations by the EDGES collaboration, however, suggest that during the cosmic dawn, roughly 200 million years after the Big Bang, the baryonic temperature was half of its expected value 10 . This observation is difficult to reconcile with the standard cosmological model but could be explained if baryons are cooled down by interactions with dark matter, as expected if their interaction rate grows steeply at low velocities 11 . Here we report that if a small fraction-less than one per cent-of the dark matter has a mini-charge, a million times smaller than the charge on the electron, and a mass in the range of 1-100 times the electron mass, then the data 10 from the EDGES experiment can be explained while remaining consistent with all other observations. We also show that the entirety of the dark matter cannot have a mini-charge."
https://openalex.org/W2803681151,"Complex neuronal circuitries such as those found in the mammalian cerebral cortex have evolved as balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Although the establishment of appropriate numbers of these cells is essential for brain function and behaviour, our understanding of this fundamental process is limited. Here we show that the survival of interneurons in mice depends on the activity of pyramidal cells in a critical window of postnatal development, during which excitatory synaptic input to individual interneurons predicts their survival or death. Pyramidal cells regulate interneuron survival through the negative modulation of PTEN signalling, which effectively drives interneuron cell death during this period. Our findings indicate that activity-dependent mechanisms dynamically adjust the number of inhibitory cells in nascent local cortical circuits, ultimately establishing the appropriate proportions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2804779112,"Advances in control techniques for vibrational quantum states in molecules present new challenges for modelling such systems, which could be amenable to quantum simulation methods. Here, by exploiting a natural mapping between vibrations in molecules and photons in waveguides, we demonstrate a reprogrammable photonic chip as a versatile simulation platform for a range of quantum dynamic behaviour in different molecules. We begin by simulating the time evolution of vibrational excitations in the harmonic approximation for several four-atom molecules, including H2CS, SO3, HNCO, HFHF, N4 and P4. We then simulate coherent and dephased energy transport in the simplest model of the peptide bond in proteins—N-methylacetamide—and simulate thermal relaxation and the effect of anharmonicities in H2O. Finally, we use multi-photon statistics with a feedback control algorithm to iteratively identify quantum states that increase a particular dissociation pathway of NH3. These methods point to powerful new simulation tools for molecular quantum dynamics and the field of femtochemistry. By mapping vibrations in molecules to photons in waveguides, the vibrational quantum dynamics of various molecules are simulated using a photonic chip."
https://openalex.org/W2803922306,"The ability of the taste system to identify a tastant (what it tastes like) enables animals to recognize and discriminate between the different basic taste qualities1,2. The valence of a tastant (whether it is appetitive or aversive) specifies its hedonic value and elicits the execution of selective behaviours. Here we examine how sweet and bitter are afforded valence versus identity in mice. We show that neurons in the sweet-responsive and bitter-responsive cortex project to topographically distinct areas of the amygdala, with strong segregation of neural projections conveying appetitive versus aversive taste signals. By manipulating selective taste inputs to the amygdala, we show that it is possible to impose positive or negative valence on a neutral water stimulus, and even to reverse the hedonic value of a sweet or bitter tastant. Remarkably, mice with silenced neurons in the amygdala no longer exhibit behaviour that reflects the valence associated with direct stimulation of the taste cortex, or with delivery of sweet and bitter chemicals. Nonetheless, these mice can still identify and discriminate between tastants, just as wild-type controls do. These results help to explain how the taste system generates stereotypic and predetermined attractive and aversive taste behaviours, and support the existence of distinct neural substrates for the discrimination of taste identity and the assignment of valence. The identity and hedonic value of tastes are encoded in distinct neural substrates; in mice, the amygdala is necessary and sufficient to drive valence-specific behaviours in response to bitter or sweet taste stimuli, and the cortex can independently represent taste identity."
https://openalex.org/W2805432278,"The $\textit{axial coupling of the nucleon}$, $g_A$, is the strength of its coupling to the $\textit{weak}$ axial current of the Standard Model of particle physics, in much the same way as the electric charge is the strength of the coupling to the electromagnetic current. This axial coupling dictates the rate at which neutrons decay to protons, the strength of the attractive long-range force between nucleons and other features of nuclear physics. Precision tests of the Standard Model in nuclear environments require a quantitative understanding of nuclear physics rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics, a pillar of the Standard Model. The prominence of $g_A$ makes it a benchmark quantity to determine theoretically - a difficult task because quantum chromodynamics is non-perturbative, precluding known analytical methods. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics provides a rigorous, non-perturbative definition of quantum chromodynamics that can be implemented numerically. It has been estimated that a precision of two percent would be possible by 2020 if two challenges are overcome: contamination of $g_A$ from excited states must be controlled in the calculations and statistical precision must be improved markedly. Here we report a calculation of $g_A^{QCD} = 1.271\pm0.013$, using an unconventional method inspired by the Feynman-Hellmann theorem that overcomes these challenges."

https://openalex.org/W2806469347,"Dendritic cells orchestrate the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity. CD8α+ dendritic cells present antigens to CD8+ T cells and elicit cytotoxic T cell responses to viruses, bacteria and tumours 1 . Although lineage-specific transcriptional regulators of CD8α+ dendritic cell development have been identified 2 , the molecular pathways that selectively orchestrate CD8α+ dendritic cell function remain elusive. Moreover, metabolic reprogramming is important for dendritic cell development and activation3,4, but metabolic dependence and regulation of dendritic cell subsets are largely uncharacterized. Here we use a data-driven systems biology algorithm (NetBID) to identify a role of the Hippo pathway kinases Mst1 and Mst2 (Mst1/2) in selectively programming CD8α+ dendritic cell function and metabolism. Our NetBID analysis reveals a marked enrichment of the activities of Hippo pathway kinases in CD8α+ dendritic cells relative to CD8α- dendritic cells. Dendritic cell-specific deletion of Mst1/2-but not Lats1 and Lats2 (Lats1/2) or Yap and Taz (Yap/Taz), which mediate canonical Hippo signalling-disrupts homeostasis and function of CD8+ T cells and anti-tumour immunity. Mst1/2-deficient CD8α+ dendritic cells are impaired in presentation of extracellular proteins and cognate peptides to prime CD8+ T cells, while CD8α- dendritic cells that lack Mst1/2 have largely normal function. Mechanistically, compared to CD8α- dendritic cells, CD8α+ dendritic cells exhibit much stronger oxidative metabolism and critically depend on Mst1/2 signalling to maintain bioenergetic activities and mitochondrial dynamics for their functional capacities. Further, selective expression of IL-12 by CD8α+ dendritic cells depends on Mst1/2 and the crosstalk with non-canonical NF-κB signalling. Our findings identify Mst1/2 as selective drivers of CD8α+ dendritic cell function by integrating metabolic activity and cytokine signalling, and highlight that the interplay between immune signalling and metabolic reprogramming underlies the unique functions of dendritic cell subsets."

https://openalex.org/W2804099821,"A central question in genetics and evolution is the extent to which the outcomes of mutations change depending on the genetic context in which they occur1–3. Pairwise interactions between mutations have been systematically mapped within4–18 and between 19 genes, and have been shown to contribute substantially to phenotypic variation among individuals 20 . However, the extent to which genetic interactions themselves are stable or dynamic across genotypes is unclear21, 22. Here we quantify more than 45,000 genetic interactions between the same 87 pairs of mutations across more than 500 closely related genotypes of a yeast tRNA. Notably, all pairs of mutations interacted in at least 9% of genetic backgrounds and all pairs switched from interacting positively to interacting negatively in different genotypes (false discovery rate < 0.1). Higher-order interactions are also abundant and dynamic across genotypes. The epistasis in this tRNA means that all individual mutations switch from detrimental to beneficial, even in closely related genotypes. As a consequence, accurate genetic prediction requires mutation effects to be measured across different genetic backgrounds and the use of higher-order epistatic terms. Mutagenesis of a yeast tRNA shows that the effects of mutations and how they interact varies both in magnitude and sign between genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2807455978,"Group VII e thylene r esponse f actors (ERF-VIIs) regulate transcriptional adaptation to flooding-induced hypoxia in plants. ERF-VII stability is controlled in an O2-dependent manner by the Cys/Arg branch of the N-end rule pathway whereby oxidation of a conserved N-terminal cysteine residue initiates target degradation. This oxidation is catalyzed by p lant c ysteine o xidases (PCOs), which use O2 as cosubstrate to generate Cys-sulfinic acid. The PCOs directly link O2 availability to ERF-VII stability and anaerobic adaptation, leading to the suggestion that they act as plant O2 sensors. However, their ability to respond to fluctuations in O2 concentration has not been established. Here, we investigated the steady-state kinetics of Arabidopsis thaliana PCOs 1-5 to ascertain whether their activities are sensitive to O2 levels. We found that the most catalytically competent isoform is AtPCO4, both in terms of responding to O2 and oxidizing AtRAP2.2/2,12 (two of the most prominent ERF-VIIs responsible for promoting the hypoxic response), which suggests that AtPCO4 plays a central role in ERF-VII regulation. Furthermore, we found that AtPCO activity is susceptible to decreases in pH and that the hypoxia-inducible AtPCOs 1/2 and the noninducible AtPCOs 4/5 have discrete AtERF-VII substrate preferences. Pertinently, the AtPCOs had Km(O2)app values in a physiologically relevant range, which should enable them to sensitively react to changes in O2 availability. This work validates an O2-sensing role for the PCOs and suggests that differences in expression pattern, ERF-VII selectivity, and catalytic capability may enable the different isoforms to have distinct biological functions. Individual PCOs could therefore be targeted to manipulate ERF-VII levels and improve stress tolerance in plants."

This unique lipid asymmetry renders the OM impermeable to external insults, including antibiotics and bile salts. In Escherichia coli, the complex comprising osmoporin OmpC and the OM lipoprotein MlaA is believed to maintain lipid asymmetry by removing mislocalized PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM. How this complex performs this function is unknown. Here, we defined the molecular architecture of the OmpC–MlaA complex to gain insights into its role in PL transport. Using in vivo photo-cross-linking and molecular dynamics simulations, we established that MlaA interacts extensively with OmpC and is located entirely within the lipid bilayer. In addition, MlaA forms a hydrophilic channel, likely enabling PL translocation across the OM. We further showed that flexibility in a hairpin loop adjacent to the channel is critical in modulating MlaA activity. Finally, we demonstrated that OmpC plays a functional role in maintaining OM lipid asymmetry together with MlaA.

Thus, the OM serves as an effective barrier against toxic compounds including detergents and antibiotics. This function is fully dependent on the establishment and maintenance of lipid asymmetry; cells generally become more sensitive to external insults when OM lipid asymmetry is disrupted, which is typically characterized by the accumulation of PLs in the outer leaflet (4.Jia W.

The requisite lipid asymmetry of the OM is likely initially established by direct placement of LPS and PLs into the outer and inner leaflets, respectively. LPS assembly into the outer leaflet of the OM is mediated by the well-established Lpt (lipopolysaccharide transport) machinery (6.Okuda S. Sherman D.J. Silhavy T.J. Ruiz N. Kahne D.

OmpC is a classical trimeric porin that typically only allows passage of hydrophilic solutes across the OM (3.Nikaido H. Molecular basis of bacterial outer membrane permeability revisited.Microbiol.

In this paper, we establish that MlaA is in fact an integral membrane protein that forms a channel adjacent to OmpC trimers in the OM, likely allowing the passage of PLs. We first demonstrated that MlaA binds the OmpC trimer within the OM bilayer by mapping the interaction surfaces using in vivo cross-linking. Using a recently predicted structural model of MlaA (17.Ovchinnikov S. Park H. Varghese N. Huang P.S. Pavlopoulos G.A. Kim D.E. Kamisetty H. Kyrpides N.C. Baker D. Protein structure determination using metagenome sequence data.Science. 2017; 355 (28104891): 294-29810.1126/science.aah4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we obtained molecular views of the OmpC–MlaA complex by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and experimentally established the existence of a hydrophilic channel within OM-embedded MlaA. Combining charge mutations in this channel modulated MlaA activity, suggesting functional importance. Furthermore, mutations altering the flexibility of a hairpin loop that could interact with the hydrophilic channel led to predictable in vivo effects on MlaA function. Finally, we identified a key residue on OmpC found at the OmpC–MlaA interacting surface that is important for proper function of the complex. Our findings provide important mechanistic insights into how PLs may be translocated across the OM to ensure proper lipid asymmetry. To develop a detailed architectural understanding of the OmpC–MlaA complex, we carried out in vivo photo-cross-linking to map intermolecular interactions within the complex. Guided by the crystal structure of the OmpC trimer (18.Baslé A. Rummel G. Storici P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. Crystal structure of osmoporin OmpC from E. coli at 2.0 A.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362 (16949612): 933-94210.1016/j.jmb.2006.08.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we introduced the UV-cross-linking amino acid, para-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa), at 49 positions in OmpC via amber suppression (19.Chin J.W. Martin A.B. King D.S. Wang L. Schultz P.G. Addition of a photocrosslinking amino acid to the genetic code of Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99 (12154230): 11020-1102410.1073/pnas.172226299Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Initial selection focused on residues that are either solvent-accessible (i.e. loop and lumen) or located near the membrane–water boundaries (i.e. aromatic girdle). Upon UV irradiation, a ∼65-kDa cross-linked band that contains both OmpC (∼37 kDa) and MlaA (∼28 kDa) could be detected in cells expressing OmpC variants substituted with pBpa at three positions (Leu50, Gln83, or Phe267) (Fig. 1A). These residues are found on the periplasmic turns at the dimeric interfaces of the OmpC trimer (Fig. 1C), thus localizing possible binding sites for MlaA. We have previously proposed that OmpC may allow MlaA to traverse the bilayer and gain access to PLs that have accumulated in the outer leaflet of the OM (12.Chong Z.S. Woo W.F. Chng S.S. Osmoporin OmpC forms a complex with MlaA to maintain outer membrane lipid asymmetry in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 98 (26314242): 1133-114610.1111/mmi.13202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because none of the six selected residues in the OmpC lumen cross-linked to MlaA, we decided to probe for interactions between MlaA and the membrane-facing side walls of OmpC, specifically around the dimeric interfaces of the OmpC trimer. Remarkably, of the additional 49 positions tested in this region, 10 residues allowed photoactivated cross-links between OmpC and MlaA when replaced with pBpa (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1). In total, these 13 cross-linking residues clearly demarcate an extensive MlaA-interacting surface on OmpC (Fig. 1C). This explains why OmpC exhibits strong interactions and can be co-purified with MlaA on an affinity column, as we have previously reported (12.Chong Z.S. Woo W.F. Chng S.S. Osmoporin OmpC forms a complex with MlaA to maintain outer membrane lipid asymmetry in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 98 (26314242): 1133-114610.1111/mmi.13202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two positions, Tyr149 and Leu340, are located right at or near the membrane–water boundary exposed to the extracellular environment, suggesting that MlaA traverses the entire width of the OM. We conclude that MlaA binds along the dimeric interfaces of the OmpC trimer in the membrane. We sought to map in greater detail the OmpC–MlaA interacting surface in vitro. To do that, we first overexpressed and purified the OmpC–MlaA complex to homogeneity. We showed that this complex forms a single peak on size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 2A). OmpC within this complex exhibits the characteristic heat-modifiable gel shift commonly observed for OM β-barrel proteins (20.Nakamura K. Mizushima S. Effects of heating in dodecyl sulfate solution on the conformation and electrophoretic mobility of isolated major outer membrane proteins from Escherichia coli K-12.J. Biochem. 1976; 80 (828162): 1411-142210.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a131414Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), consistent with the presence of the folded trimer. Multiangle light scattering (MALS) analysis revealed that one copy of MlaA interacts with the OmpC trimer (Fig. S2), suggesting that only one of the three dimeric interfaces within the trimer is available for binding (Fig. 1C). We next performed protease digestion experiments to identify specific region(s) on MlaA that may interact stably with OmpC. OM β-barrel proteins such as OmpC are known to be protease-resistant (21.Tamm L.K. Hong H. Liang B. Folding and assembly of β-barrel membrane proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666 (15519319): 250-26310.1016/j.bbamem.2004.06.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Given that some parts of MlaA contact OmpC within the membrane, we expect these bound regions to also be protected from proteolytic degradation. Treatment of the purified OmpC–MlaA complex with trypsin results in almost complete degradation of MlaA, with the OmpC trimer remaining intact (Fig. 2A). Following SEC, however, we found that an ∼8-kDa peptide (presumably from MlaA) remains stably bound to the trimer. N-terminal sequencing and tandem MS analyses revealed that this peptide corresponds to MlaAD61–K124 (Fig. 2, A and C, and Fig. S3). These results suggest that MlaA interacts strongly with OmpC in the membrane in part via this specific region. To define how OmpC contacts the MlaAD61–K124 peptide, we next attempted to overexpress and purify pBpa-containing OmpC variants in complex with MlaA and determine which of the previously identified 13 OmpC residues interacts with MlaAD61–K124 in vitro. We sequentially performed UV cross-linking and trypsin digestion to potentially link MlaAD61–K124 to specific residues on OmpC. This approach may also allow trapping of other potential interacting regions of MlaA, which might not have been stably retained on the WT complex after trypsin digestion. We successfully detected trypsin-resistant cross-linked products for seven OmpCpBpa–MlaA complexes (Fig. 2B); they appeared slightly above OmpC between 37 and 50 kDa, indicating that peptides in the range of ∼6–10 kDa are cross-linked to OmpC. N-terminal sequencing of six of the seven adducts showed the presence of OmpC and an MlaA peptide beginning at residue Asp61 (Fig. 2, C and D, and Fig. S3C). Given the approximate sizes of the cross-linked adducts, we concluded that all these residues interact with MlaAD61–K124. Interestingly, an additional peptide on MlaA starting at residue Phe133 was also found to cross-link at two (Tyr149 and Leu340) of these six positions on OmpC (Fig. 2, B–D, and Fig. S3C). These adducts can be detected by an α-MlaA antibody that recognizes an epitope within Val182–Gln195 on MlaA (Fig. 2B), suggesting that a peptide from Phe133 to at least Arg205 (next trypsin cleavage site) may be cross-linked (Fig. 2C). Thus, in addition to MlaAD61–K124, our cross-linking strategy revealed a second point of contact (MlaAF133–R205) between OmpC and MlaA. At the point of these findings, there was no available molecular structure for MlaA; however, a structural model has been predicted based on residue–residue contacts inferred from co-evolution analysis of metagenomic sequence data (17.Ovchinnikov S. Park H. Varghese N. Huang P.S. Pavlopoulos G.A. Kim D.E. Kamisetty H. Kyrpides N.C. Baker D. Protein structure determination using metagenome sequence data.Science. 2017; 355 (28104891): 294-29810.1126/science.aah4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Using a rigorously validated quality score, this method of structure determination has generated reliable models for 614 protein families with currently unknown structures. We experimentally validated the model for MlaA by replacing residue pairs far apart on the primary sequence with cysteines and showed that only those that are highly co-evolved (and predicted to be residue–residue contacts) allow disulfide-bond formation in cells (Fig. S4). We therefore proceeded to use this MlaA model to understand the organization of the OmpC–MlaA complex. Interestingly, the positions of the two OmpC-contacting peptides on the MlaA model are spatially separated in a way consistent with the arrangement of the residues on OmpC that cross-link to each peptide (Fig. 2D). This not only reveals how MlaA may potentially be oriented and organized around the dimeric interface of the OmpC trimer but also suggests that the entire MlaA molecule may reside in the membrane. In fact, the overall surface of MlaA, other than the putative periplasmic-facing region, is largely hydrophobic (Fig. S5). Furthermore, using all-atomistic MD simulations, we found that the structural fold of MlaA appears to be more stable in a lipid bilayer than in an aqueous environment (Fig. S6). Consistent with this, we noted that even without its N-terminal lipid anchor, MlaA is largely not extracted from total membranes by short washes of high pH, chaotropic, or mild detergent solutions (Fig. S7); its membrane extraction profile is similar to β-barrel proteins but different from known peripheral membrane proteins, indicating that MlaA is stably inserted in the OM as an integral membrane protein. Collectively, these observations lend strong support to the validity of the predicted MlaA structure. To obtain a physical picture of how OmpC interacts with MlaA within the complex, we used MD simulations to dock MlaA onto the OmpC trimer within a PL bilayer. Using a previously reported protocol (22.Kozakov D. Hall D.R. Xia B. Porter K.A. Padhorny D. Yueh C. Beglov D. Vajda S. The ClusPro web server for protein-protein docking.Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 (28079879): 255-27810.1038/nprot.2016.16910.1038/nprot.2016.156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), we first docked the MlaA model onto the OmpC trimer structure, both as rigid bodies. Interestingly, all initial docked structures contained MlaA binding at one dimeric interface of OmpC. Based on information derived from cross-linking, we selected two most consistent models differing slightly in how MlaA is oriented with respect to OmpC for unrestrained refinements using all-atomistic simulations. Multiple simulations were run for each MlaA orientation in a PL bilayer until overall root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) stabilized; remarkably, the resulting equilibrium models fulfilled all observed experimental cross-linking data. We performed clustering on all available trajectories and identified the most populated conformations of the OmpC–MlaA complex in our simulations (Fig. 3A and Fig. S8A for one MlaA orientation and Fig. 3B and Fig. S8B for the other). These conformational models all show MlaA sitting in the bilayer, tucked nicely into the dimeric interface of the OmpC trimer. Evidently, the MlaAD61–K124 peptide interacts extensively with OmpC in these models, consistent with why this peptide remains stably bound to OmpC after protease digestion (Fig. 2A). We also mutated several MlaA residues found at the OmpC–MlaA interfaces to pBpa and performed in vivo cross-linking experiments. We identified one position, Leu109, that allowed strong photoactivatable cross-linking to OmpC when replaced with pBpa (Fig. 3C). This residue lies within the MlaAD61–K124 peptide (Fig. 3, A and B), confirming that this region does in fact contact OmpC in cells. One striking feature present in all the simulated OmpC–MlaA models is a negatively charged hydrophilic channel within MlaA that spans the lipid bilayer (Fig. 4A and Fig. S9). To test the existence of this hydrophilic channel in MlaA, especially in the context of the native OM, we selected 27 residues in and around the putative channel in a representative model (Fig. 4 and Fig. S10) and determined their solvent accessibility in cells using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM). We first showed that these cysteine mutants are functional (Fig. S10C). Solvent-exposed residues are expected to be reactive with the charged membrane-impermeable thiol-labeling reagent sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSES). Remarkably, we found that residues predicted to be within the putative channel (Fig. 4, A and B) or at the membrane–water boundaries (Fig. S10, A and B) are indeed accessible to MTSES. We therefore conclude that MlaA forms a hydrophilic channel in the OM in cells. Very recently, crystal structures of MlaA in complex with trimeric porins have in fact been solved (23.Abellón-Ruiz J. Kaptan S.S. Baslé A. Claudi B. Bumann D. Kleinekathöfer U. van den Berg B. Structural basis for maintenance of bacterial outer membrane lipid asymmetry.Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 (29038444): 1616-162310.1038/s41564-017-0046-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the experimentally determined structures of MlaA closely resembled the initial MlaA model predicted from co-evolution analysis (Fig. S11A). These structures revealed that MlaA interacts with trimeric porins in the membrane at one or more of their dimeric interfaces (Fig. S11B), in an orientation similar to one of our simulated OmpC–MlaA models (Fig. 3B). They also showed that MlaA contains a hydrophilic channel. Although these structural and our biochemical/modeling studies are in good agreement, there are some discrepancies between the solved structures and our biochemical data. Specifically, the distances separating porin residues equivalent to Tyr149/Leu340 in OmpC and the MlaAF133–R205 peptide in the solved structures (Fig. S11B) are not consistent with the detection of strong in vivo photoactivatable cross-links between these regions in the complex (Fig. 2B). In addition, the proposed locations of some MlaA residues, specifically Met39, Phe42, and Asn43, at the interior of the lipid bilayer (Fig. S11B) are not in agreement with high or partial solvent accessibility of these sites in cells, as highlighted in the SCAM data (Fig. S10B). These observations suggest that MlaA might adopt a different conformation in its native environment in the OM than that in a crystal lattice. Based on its function in removing PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM, we hypothesize that this channel may allow passage of charged head groups as PLs translocate across the membrane. To ascertain whether this channel is functionally important, we separately mutated 19 polar and (negatively) charged residues near or within the channel to alanine or arginine an"

In cancer, mTOR signaling is highly activated, and the regulation of this signaling, as an anti-cancer strategy, has been emphasized. However, PP242 (inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2) alone did not induce human renal carcinoma cell death. In this study, we found that PP242 alone did not alter cell viability, but combined curcumin and PP242 treatment induced cell death. Combined PP242 and curcumin treatment induced Bax activation and decreased expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2. Furthermore, co-treatment with PP242 and curcumin-induced the downregulation of the Rictor (an mTORC2 complex protein) and Akt protein levels, and ectopic overexpression of Rictor or Akt inhibited PP242 plus curcumin induced cell death. Downregulation of Rictor increased cytosolic Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum, which led to lysosomal damage in PP242 plus curcumin-treated cells. Furthermore, damaged lysosomes induced autophagy. Autophagy inhibitors markedly inhibited cell death. Finally, combined curcumin and PP242 treatment reduced tumor growth and induced cell death in xenograft models. Altogether, our results reveal that combined PP242 and curcumin treatment could induce autophagy-mediated cell death by reducing the expression of Rictor and Akt in renal carcinoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2804982001,"Ancient cartilaginous vertebrates, such as sharks, skates and rays, possess specialized electrosensory organs that detect weak electric fields and relay this information to the central nervous system1–4. Sharks exploit this sensory modality for predation, whereas skates may also use it to detect signals from conspecifics 5 . Here we analyse shark and skate electrosensory cells to determine whether discrete physiological properties could contribute to behaviourally relevant sensory tuning. We show that sharks and skates use a similar low threshold voltage-gated calcium channel to initiate cellular activity but use distinct potassium channels to modulate this activity. Electrosensory cells from sharks express specially adapted voltage-gated potassium channels that support large, repetitive membrane voltage spikes capable of driving near-maximal vesicular release from elaborate ribbon synapses. By contrast, skates use a calcium-activated potassium channel to produce small, tunable membrane voltage oscillations that elicit stimulus-dependent vesicular release. We propose that these sensory adaptations support amplified indiscriminate signal detection in sharks compared with selective frequency detection in skates, potentially reflecting the electroreceptive requirements of these elasmobranch species. Our findings demonstrate how sensory systems adapt to suit the lifestyle or environmental niche of an animal through discrete molecular and biophysical modifications. Shark and skate electrosensory cells use specific potassium channels to support either indiscriminate detection of electrical stimuli or selective frequency tuning, respectively, demonstrating adaptation of sensory systems through discrete molecular modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2807073094,"Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene have been identified in a number of cancer types, including brain cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas project has revealed that IDH1 mutations occur in 70–80% of grade II and grade III gliomas. Until recently, most of the functional studies of IDH1 mutations in cellular models have been conducted in overexpression systems with the IDH1 wild type background. In this study, we employed a modified CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technique called “single base editing”, and efficiently introduced heterozygous IDH1 R132H mutation (IDH1R132H/WT) in human astroglial cells. Global DNA methylation profiling revealed hypermethylation as well as hypomethylation induced by IDH1R132H/WT. Global gene expression analysis identified molecular targets and pathways altered by IDH1R132H/WT, including cell proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM), and cell migration. Our phenotype analysis indicated that compared with IDH1 wild type cells, IDH1R132H/WT promoted cell migration by upregulating integrin β4 (ITGB4); and significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Using our mutated IDH1 models generated by “single base editing”, we identified novel molecular targets of IDH1R132H/WT, namely Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its downstream signaling pathway Notch, to mediate the cell growth-inhibiting effect of IDH1R132H/WT. In summary, the “single base editing” strategy has successfully created heterozygous IDH1 R132H mutation that recapitulates the naturally occurring IDH1 mutation. Our isogenic cellular systems that differ in a single nucleotide in one allele of the IDH1 gene provide a valuable model for novel discoveries of IDH1R132H/WT-driven biological events."
https://openalex.org/W2805732661,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori is one of the strongest risk factors for development of gastric cancer. Although these bacteria infect approximately half of the world’s population, only a small fraction of infected individuals develops gastric malignancies. Interactions between host and bacterial virulence factors are complex and interrelated, making it difficult to elucidate specific processes associated with H. pylori-induced tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that H. pylori inhibits p14ARF tumor suppressor by inducing its degradation. This effect was found to be strain-specific. Downregulation of p14ARF induced by H. pylori leads to inhibition of autophagy in a p53-independent manner in infected cells. We identified TRIP12 protein as E3 ubiquitin ligase that is upregulated by H. pylori, inducing ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p14ARF protein. Using isogenic H. pylori mutants, we found that induction of TRIP12 is mediated by bacterial virulence factor CagA. Increased expression of TRIP12 protein was found in infected gastric epithelial cells in vitro and human gastric mucosa of H. pylori-infected individuals. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a new mechanism of ARF inhibition that may affect host–bacteria interactions and facilitate tumorigenic transformation in the stomach."

Epigenetic changes are frequently tissue-specific events in carcinogenesis and hence may serve as diagnostic biomarkers.138 representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues (116 lung cancer cases and 22 benign controls) were used for targeted DNA methylation analysis via pyrosequencing of ten literature-derived methylation markers (APC, CDH1, CDKN2A, EFEMP1, FHIT, L1RE1, MGMT, PTEN, RARB, and RASSF1). Methylation levels were analyzed with the Classification and Regression Tree Algorithm (CART), Conditional Interference Trees (ctree) and ROC. Validation was performed with additional 27 lung cancer cases and 38 benign controls. TCGA data for 282 lung cancer cases was included in the analysis.CART and ctree analysis identified the combination of L1RE1 and RARB as well as L1RE1 and RASSF1 as independent methylation markers with high discriminative power between tumor and benign tissue (for each combination, 91% specificity and 100% sensitivity). L1RE1 methylation associated significantly with tumor type and grade (p<0.001) with highest methylation in the control group. The opposite was found for RARB (p<0.001). RASSF1 methylation increased with tumor type and grade (p<0.001) with strongest methylation in neuroendocrine tumors (NET).Hypomethylation of L1RE1 is frequent in tumors compared to benign controls and associates with higher grade, whereas increasing methylation of RARB is an independent marker for tumors and higher grade. RASSF1 hypermethylation was frequent in tumors and most prominent in NET making it an auxiliary marker for separation of NSCLC and NET. L1RE1 in combination with either RARB or RASSF1 could function as biomarkers for separating lung cancer and non-cancerous tissue and could be useful for samples of limited size such as biopsies."

https://openalex.org/W2806925743,"Sphingolipids such as ceramide are important constituents of cell membranes. The ceramide transfer protein (CERT) moves ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus in a nonvesicular manner. Hyperphosphorylation of the serine-repeat motif (SRM) adjacent to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of CERT down-regulates the inter-organelle ceramide transport function of CERT. However, the mechanistic details of this down-regulation remain elusive. Using solution NMR and binding assays, we herein show that a hyperphosphorylation-mimetic CERT variant in which 10 serine/threonine residues of SRM had been replaced with glutamate residues (the 10E variant) displays an intramolecular interaction between SRM and positively charged regions of the PH domain, which are involved in the binding of this domain to phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI4P). Of note, the binding of the PH domain to PI4P-embedded membranes was attenuated by the SRM 10E substitutions in cell-free assays. Moreover, the 10E substitutions reduced the Golgi-targeting activity of the PH-SRM construct in living cells. These results indicate that hyperphosphorylated SRM directly interacts with the surface of the PH domain in an intramolecular manner, thereby decreasing the PI4P-binding activity of the PH domain. In light of these findings, we propose that the hyperphosphorylation of SRM may trigger the dissociation of CERT from the Golgi apparatus, resulting in a functionally less active conformation of CERT."
https://openalex.org/W2807100879,"Purkinje neuron dendritic degeneration precedes cell loss in cerebellar ataxia, but the basis for dendritic vulnerability in ataxia remains poorly understood. Recent work has suggested that potassium (K+) channel dysfunction and consequent spiking abnormalities contribute to Purkinje neuron degeneration, but little attention has been paid to how K+ channel dysfunction impacts dendritic excitability and the role this may play in the degenerative process. We examined the relationship between K+ channel dysfunction, dendritic excitability and dendritic degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Examination of published RNA sequencing data from SCA1 mice revealed reduced expression of several K+ channels that are important regulators of excitability in Purkinje neuron dendrites. Patch clamp recordings in Purkinje neurons from SCA1 mice identified increased dendritic excitability in the form of enhanced back-propagation of action potentials and an increased propensity to produce dendritic calcium spikes. Dendritic excitability could be rescued by restoring expression of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and activating other K+ channels with baclofen. Importantly, this treatment combination improves motor performance and mitigates dendritic degeneration in SCA1 mice. These results suggest that reduced expression of K+ channels results in persistently increased dendritic excitability at all stages of disease in SCA1, which in turn may contribute to the dendritic degeneration that precedes cell loss."
https://openalex.org/W2806061720,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) adopts several unique metabolic strategies to support primary tumor growth. Whether additional metabolic strategies are adopted to support metastatic tumorigenesis is less clear. This could be particularly relevant for distant metastasis, which often follows a rapidly progressive clinical course. Here we report that PDAC distant metastases evolve a unique series of metabolic reactions to maintain activation of the anabolic glucose enzyme phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD). PGD catalytic activity was recurrently elevated across distant metastases, and modulating PGD activity levels dictated tumorigenic capacity. Metabolomics data raised the possibility that distant metastases evolved a core pentose conversion pathway (PCP) that converted glucose-derived metabolites into PGD substrate, thereby hyperactivating the enzyme. Consistent with this, each individual metabolite in the PCP stimulated PGD catalysis in distant metastases, and knockdown of each individual PCP enzyme selectively impaired tumorigenesis. We propose that the PCP manufactures PGD substrate outside of the rate-limiting oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP). This enables PGD-dependent tumorigenesis by providing adequate substrate to fuel high catalytic activity, and raises the possibility that PDAC distant metastases adopt their own unique metabolic strategies to support tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2807300617,"Background The relative influence of prematurity vs. maternal social factors (socioeconomic status and education level) on academic performance has rarely been examined. Objective To examine the impact of prematurity and maternal social factors on academic performance from 3rd through 8th grade. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants born in 1998 at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The study sample included 58 extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, 23‒<28 weeks), 171 preterm (≥28‒<34 weeks), 228 late preterm (≥34‒<37 weeks), and 967 term ((≥37‒<42 weeks) infants. Neonatal and maternal variables were collected including maternal insurance status (proxy measure for socioeconomic status) and education level. The primary outcomes were literacy and mathematics achievement-test scores from 3rd through 8th grade. Linear mixed models were used to identify significant predictors of academic performance. All two-way interactions between grade level, gestational-age (GA) groups, and social factors were tested for statistical significance. Results Prematurity, social factors, gender, race, gravidity, and Apgar score at one minute were critical determinants of academic performance. Favorable social factors were associated with a significant increase in both literacy and mathematic scores, while prematurity was associated with a significant decrease in mathematic scores. Examination of GA categories and social factors interaction suggested that the impact of social factors on test scores was similar for all GA groups. Furthermore, the impact of social factors varied from grade to grade for literacy, while the influence of either GA groups or social factors was constant across grades for mathematics. For example, an ELGAN with favorable social factors had a predicted literacy score 104.1 (P <.001), 98.2 (P <.001), and 76.4 (P <.01) points higher than an otherwise similar disadvantaged term infant at grades 3, 5, and 8, respectively. The difference in their predicted mathematic scores was 33.4 points for all grades (P <.05). Conclusion While there were significant deficits in academic performance for ELGANs compared to PT, LPT, and term infants, the deficit could be offset by higher SES and better-educated mothers. These favorable social factors were critical to a child’s academic achievement. The role of socioeconomic factors should be incorporated in discussions on outcome with families of preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W2805469686,"The effects of two different slipping methods on the survival, physical and physiological response of sardines, Sardina pilchardus, captured in a purse-seine fishery were investigated in southern Portugal. Sardines were collected and transferred into holding tanks onboard a commercial fishing vessel after being captured, crowded and deliberately released using two slipping procedures: standard and modified. The standard slipping procedure aggregated fish at high densities and made them “roll over” the floatline, while the modified procedure aggregated the fish at moderate densities and enabled them to escape through an opening created by adding weights to the floatline. Both slipping methods were compared with minimally harmed non-slipped sardines (sardines collected from the loose pocket of the purse seine). Survival rates were monitored in captivity over 28 days using three replicates for each treatment. The estimated survival of sardines was 43.6% for the non-slipped fish, 44.7% for the modified slipping and 11.7% for the standard slipping treatments. Scale loss indicated the level of physical impact experienced, with dead fish from the non-slipped and modified slipping technique showing significantly lower scale loss than those fish from the standard slipping treatment within the same period. Of the physiological indicators of stress measured, cortisol, glucose, lactate and osmolality attained peak values during slipping and up to the first hours after introduction to captivity. This work indicates that although delayed mortality after release may be substantial, appropriately modified slipping techniques significantly enhance survival of slipped sardines."

Circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels are closely associated with atherosclerosis. The flavin mono-oxygenase family (Fmo) members oxidize trimethylamine (TMA) to TMAO. The effect and the regulatory mechanism of intestinal microflora on diabetes-induced Fmo3 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) expression were examined in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (STZDM) and Akita mice (C57BL/6J-Ins2Akita). STZDM-JNK1-/- and Ins2Akita-JNK1-/- mice were produced and used to study the role of pJNK in the regulatory mechanisms. Diabetic mice exhibited decreased Lactobacilli growth and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the intestinal mucosa; increased levels of pJNK and iNOS proteins in the intestinal mucosa; increased levels of serum nitrate, IL-1β, and TNF-α expression in Kupffer cells; increased Fmo3 expression in the liver; and increased ICAM expression in the aorta. Reversal of diabetes-induced enteric dysbiosis by prebiotic (FOS) or probiotic (dead L. plantarum) treatment decreased diabetes-induced pJNK and iNOS expression in the intestine, Fmo3 expression in the liver, IL-1β expression in Kupffer cells, and ICAM expression in the aorta and liver. Ins2Akita-JNK1-/- and STZDM-JNK1-/- mice demonstrated decreased levels of serum NO, IL-1β expression in Kupffer cells, Fmo3 expression in the liver, and ICAM expression in the aorta. GF mice cohoused with DM mice demonstrated an increase in ICAM expression in the liver. In conclusion, diabetes induced the expression of both Fmo3 and ICAM expression and possible vascular impairment through enteric dysbiosis. Diabetes-induced Fmo3 and ICAM expression could be reversed by pJNK inhibition or by correcting enteric dysbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2806195158,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective way to lose weight and reverse type 2 diabetes. We profiled the metabolome of 18 obese patients (nine euglycemic and nine diabetics) that underwent RYGB surgery and seven lean subjects. Plasma samples from the obese patients were collected before the surgery and one week and three months after the surgery. We analyzed the metabolome in association to five hormones (Adiponectin, Insulin, Ghrelin, Leptin, and Resistin), four peptide hormones (GIP, Glucagon, GLP1, and PYY), and two cytokines (IL-6 and TNF). PCA showed samples cluster by surgery time and many microbially driven metabolites (indoles in particular) correlated with the three months after the surgery. Network analysis of metabolites revealed a connection between carbohydrate (mannosamine and glucosamine) and glyoxylate and confirms glyoxylate association to diabetes. Only leptin and IL-6 had a significant association with the measured metabolites. Leptin decreased immediately after RYGB (before significant weight loss), whereas IL-6 showed no consistent response to RYGB. Moreover, leptin associated with tryptophan in support of the possible role of leptin in the regulation of serotonin synthesis pathways in the gut. These results suggest a potential link between gastric leptin and microbial-derived metabolites in the context of obesity and diabetes."

In RARβ2−/− F9 cells Hoxa1, Hoxb5, RARα, and Sfrp2 are induced, albeit to a lesser extent, whereas Cdx1 and Aurkc are fully induced (23Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J.

Overall, induction of specific RA-responsive target genes is affected by genetic abrogation of individual RARs, whereas other aspects of RA signaling persist.

In addition, primary targets of RA may induce transcription of secondary targets, e.g. RA-induced genes that lack RAREs. We have identified a group of genes (including CoupTF1 and CoupTF2) that exhibits delayed RA-responsiveness. Characteristic of these genes, the RA-induced dissociation of polycomb-group proteins (PcG) from DNA was significantly delayed relative to that of direct genomic targets of RA, such as Hoxa1 and Hoxa5 (17Laursen K.B.

We found that RA disrupts the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) signaling, altering cellular phosphorylation (8Tighe A.P. Gudas L.J. Retinoic acid inhibits leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathways in mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198 (14603524): 223-22910.1002/jcp.10424Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but the exact mechanisms of RA-dependent transcriptional gene repression have yet to be determined. RA also induces protein phosphorylation through the activation of cellular kinases (37Bastien J. Plassat J.L. Payrastre B. Rochette-Egly C. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway is essential for the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 cells.Oncogene. 2006; 25 (16288212): 2040-204710.1038/sj.onc.1209241Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Possibly functioning through cytoplasmic RARs (38Han Y.H. Zhou H. Kim J.H. Yan T.D. Lee K.H. Wu H. Lin F. Lu N. Liu J. Zeng J.Z. Zhang X.K. A unique cytoplasmic localization of retinoic acid receptor-γ and its regulations.J. Biol.

Germain P. Dynamic and combinatorial control of gene expression by nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs).Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2009; 7 (19471584): e00510.1621/nrs.07005Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, the translocation of Rbp4 (Srbp) bound retinol to Rbp1 (Crbp1) was demonstrated to activate the Jak/Stat phosphorylation cascade through the Stra6 membrane receptor (40Berry D.C. O'Byrne S.M. Vreeland A.C. Blaner W.S. Noy N. Cross-talk between signalling and vitamin A transport by the retinol-binding protein receptor STRA6.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32 (22665496): 3164-317510.1128/MCB.00505-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether this intersects with the LIFR pathway, but if so, this pathway could potentially account for the altered cellular phosphorylation in response to vitamin A. Finally, RA can regulate transcription through the orphan receptors CoupTF2, PPARβ/δ, and RORβ (41Kruse S.W. Suino-Powell K. Zhou X.E. Kretschman J.E. Reynolds R. Vonrhein C. Xu Y. Wang L. Tsai S.Y.

In summary, RA may elicit transcriptional responses 1) through RARs α, β, and γ; 2) through nuclear receptors other than the RARs; and 3) through a nongenomic phosphorylation cascade, possibly involving RARs located in the cytoplasm (38Han Y.H. Zhou H. Kim J.H. Yan T.D. Lee K.H. Wu H. Lin F. Lu N. Liu J. Zeng J.Z. Zhang X.K. A unique cytoplasmic localization of retinoic acid receptor-γ and its regulations.J. Biol.

These three routes of RA signaling were identified in various biochemical assays and cell types, yet it remains to be determined how many of these routes are functional in ES cells. We wanted to determine the potential of embryonic stem cells to respond to RA through routes not involving RARs. We therefore generated an RAR triple knockout (TKO) ES cell line that lacks RARs α, β, and γ. We then mapped RA-induced changes in the transcriptomes of WT and RAR TKO ES cells and found that upon biallelic abrogation of all three RAR genes, the ES cells fail to respond transcriptionally to RA, i.e. the transcriptome profile does not change in response to RA. We conclude that embryonic stem cells that lack functional RARs α, β, and γ fail to initiate the transcriptional changes commonly associated with RA-responsiveness in stem cells. Consequently, in murine ES cells the RARs provide the only route for RA to regulate transcript levels. As outlined above, RA may elicit transcriptional responses through one or several mechanisms. We wanted to determine the roles of RARα, β, and γ in cellular RA-responsiveness, and thus evaluate potential non–RAR-mediated signaling routes of RA. We therefore sequentially abrogated RARγ, RARβ, and RARα using CRISPR technology (Fig. 1A). Following each step of genome edits, single cells were expanded and genotyped by PCR, and allelic modifications were mapped to ascertain biallelic introduction of frameshift mutations (Fig. 1B). The six resulting alleles in the established RARγ−/−, RARβ−/−, RARα−/− TKO ES cell line are depicted (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the genome edits impact all known isoforms of each of the three receptors, and the resulting cell line is thus null for all RAR isoforms and isotypes. We wanted to evaluate the induction of direct targets of RA. We therefore determined the transcript levels of Cdx1, Cyp26a1, RARβ2, and Hoxa1 in RARγ−/− (KO; 33643); RARβ−/−;RARγ−/− (double knockout (DKO); 34523); and RARα−/−;RARβ−/−;RARγ−/− (triple knockout (TKO); 40479) cell lines following 24 and 48 h of RA treatment (Fig. 1D). We found that Cyp26a1 and Hoxa1, both RARγ targets (19Kashyap V. Laursen K.B. Brenet F. Viale A.J. Scandura J.M. Gudas L.J. RARγ is essential for retinoic acid induced chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation in embryonic stem cells.J.

The ability to induce cellular growth arrest is one of the hallmark features of RA (44Wightman J. Roberson M.S. Lamkin T.J. Varvayanis S. Yen A. Retinoic acid-induced growth arrest and differentiation: Retinoic acid up-regulates CD32 (FcγRII) expression, the ectopic expression of which retards the cell cycle.Mol.

Retinoic acid promotes density-dependent growth arrest in human retinal pigment epithelial cells.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32 (1846132): 65-72PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated the ability of the RAR TKO cell line for growth arrest, and found that whereas the WT cells (and RARγ KO cells, data not shown) growth arrested, the RAR TKO cells showed unimpaired proliferation in the presence of RA (Fig. 2A). We next wanted to identify any transcriptional changes elicited by RA treatment of the TKO cells (i.e. RAR-independent signaling of RA). We therefore performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of untreated and RA-treated TKO cells (in triplicate independent experimental setups). For reference, untreated and RA-treated WT ES cells were analyzed in parallel. We used unsupervised clustering analysis to evaluate the relatedness of the samples (Fig. 2B). The WT groups clustered together in a manner corresponding to the treatment. In contrast, the TKO groups clustered together pair-wise according to the biological replicates, indicating that the RA-treated TKO cells did not constitute a group different from the untreated TKO cells. Inspection of the read-abundance at the CRISPR-targeted sites of RARα and RARγ confirmed the presence of frameshift mutations in RARα and RARγ (Fig. S2) corresponding to the deletions identified on a genomic template. The read-abundance also demonstrates biallelic expression of both RARα and RARγ in the ES cell line. We next evaluated individual transcripts for differential expression between untreated and RA-treated cells. When plotting the -fold change (RA-responsiveness) against mean expression level it is evident that numerous genes in the WT cells are differentially expressed in response to RA (statistically significant changes are marked in red in Fig. 2C). In contrast, RA treatment of TKO cells induced no statistically significant changes in any of the gene transcripts (Fig. 2C). For further visualization we plotted the 20 most up- or down-regulated transcripts in RA-treated WT cells relative to these transcript levels in TKO cells. We note that the levels of these 40 transcripts change in response to RA only in the WT and not in the TKO cells (Fig. 2D). RA induces expression of several differentiation markers. Specifically, RARγ is required for the induction of Cyp26a1 and Hoxa1, but not for the induction of Cdx1 and Stra8 transcripts (19Kashyap V. Laursen K.B. Brenet F. Viale A.J. Scandura J.M. Gudas L.J. RARγ is essential for retinoic acid induced chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation in embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 (23264745): 999-100810.1242/jcs.119701Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Induction of CoupTF1 and Meis1 by RA is enhanced by polycomb depletion, which in contrast does not affect Cyp26a1 and Hoxa1 transcript levels (17Laursen K.B. Mongan N.P. Zhuang Y. Ng M.M. Benoit Y.D. Gudas L.J. Polycomb recruitment attenuates retinoic acid–induced transcription of the bivalent NR2F1 gene.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23666625): 6430-644310.1093/nar/gkt367Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consequently, Cyp26a1/Hoxa1, Cdx1/Stra8, and CoupTF1/Meis1 represent three mechanistically different types of RA induction. We determined the levels of these transcripts in WT and TKO cells in response to RA. All six transcripts were increased in WT cells (6-fold or more) but exhibited no increase by RA in the TKO cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, these six transcript levels in TKO cells were comparable to those of untreated WT cells. In addition to inducing differentiation, RA decreases stem cell marker transcript levels. We therefore determined the transcript levels of key stem cell markers Nanog, Oct4, Zfp42, Sox2, Klf4, and Sall4 (35Mendoza-Parra M.A. Walia M. Sankar M. Gronemeyer H.

https://openalex.org/W2805126403,"For nearly a century, conventional microbiological methods have been standard practice for detecting and identifying pathogens in food. Nevertheless, the microbiological safety of food has improved and various rapid methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional methods. Alternative methods are expected to detect low cell numbers, since the presence in food of even a single cell of a pathogenic organism may be infectious. With respect to low population levels, the performance of a detection method is assessed by producing serial dilutions of a pure bacterial suspension to inoculate representative food matrices with highly diluted bacterial cells (fewer than 10 CFU/ml). The accuracy of data obtained by multiple dilution techniques is not certain and does not exclude some colonies arising from clumps of cells. Micromanipulation techniques to capture and isolate single cells from environmental samples were introduced more than 40 years ago. The main limitation of the current micromanipulation technique is still the low recovery rate for the growth of a single cell in culture medium. In this study, we describe a new single cell isolation method and demonstrate that it can be used successfully to grow various types of microorganism from picked individual cells. Tests with Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including cocci, rods, aerobes, anaerobes, yeasts and molds showed growth recovery rates from 60% to 100% after micromanipulation. We also highlight the use of our method to evaluate and challenge the detection limits of standard detection methods in food samples contaminated by a single cell of Salmonella enterica."

https://openalex.org/W2807390155,"Previous studies from South Ethiopia have shown that interventions that focus on intrapartum care substantially reduce maternal mortality and there is a need to operationalize health packages that could reduce stillbirths. The aim of this paper is to evaluate if a programme that aimed to improve maternal health, and mainly focusing on strengthening intrapartum care, also would reduce the number of stillbirths, and to estimate if there are other indicators that explains high stillbirth rates. Our study used a ""continuum of care"" approach and focussed on providing essential antenatal and obstetric services in communities through health extension workers, at antenatal and health facility services. In this follow up study, which includes the same 38.312 births registered by community health workers, shows that interventions focusing on improved intrapartum care can also reduce stillbirths (by 46%; from 14.5 to 7.8 per 1000 births). Other risk factors for stillbirths are mainly related to complications during delivery and illnesses during pregnancy. We show that focusing on Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care and antenatal services reduces stillbirths. However, the study also underlines that illnesses during pregnancy and complications during delivery still represent the main risk factors for stillbirths. This indicates that obstetric care need still to be strengthened, should include the continuum of care from home to the health facility, make care accessible to all, and reduce delays."

In our study, we identified 383 refugee-inpatients admitted to the University Hospital Münster, Germany between September 2015 and September 2016. For this patient cohort screening for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was recommended in our institution. Until May 2016 pre-emptive isolation was applied to all refugee-inpatients until the exclusion of these multidrug-resistant organisms. MRSA were found in 34 refugee-patients (9.8%), MDR-GNB in 25 refugee-patients (12.9%) and VRE in none of the refugee patients. We did not find any strains carrying carbapenemases. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data demonstrated that the respective isolates were genetically heterogeneous and revealed no transmission of refugee-patient isolates to other patients. We therefore omitted pre-emptive isolation as an infection control measure for this group of patients. Furthermore, molecular typing did not show evidence for nosocomial transmission from refugee-patients to other patients. Standard hygiene measures successfully prevented the transmission of refugee-patient isolates to other patients and as a result introduction into the healthcare system. This underlines that any multidrug-resistant organisms present within this cohort are not of any extraordinary concern for health systems."
https://openalex.org/W2807031443,"Background To investigate the treatment outcomes and predictors of response to photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients with symptomatic circumscribed hemangioma (CCH). Methods This retrospective case series examined 20 patients with symptomatic CCH (10 submacular CCHs and10 juxtapapillary CCHs) who underwent standard PDT (wavelength: 662 nm; light dose: 50J/cm2; exposure time: 83 sec) with verteporfin (6mg/m2), either as monotherapy (n = 9) or in association with other treatments (n = 11), of which 7 received intravitreal injections (IVI) of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). A post-PDT improvement of at least two lines in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was the primary outcome measure. Predictors of response were investigated with binary logistic regression analysis. Results Seventeen (85%) patients received one PDT session, and three patients (15%) underwent PDT at least twice. Ten patients (50%) achieved the primary outcome of a post-PDT BCVA improvement of at least two lines. Macular atrophy and recalcitrant cystoid macular edema in 2 patients. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age (< 50 years) (P = 0.033), pre-PDT BCVA of ≧20/200 (P = 0.013), exudative retinal detachment resolved within one month after PDT (P = 0.007), and a thinner post-PDT tumor thickness (P = 0.015) were associated with the achievement of a post-PDT BCVA improvement. Additional treatments to PDT including IVI anti-VEGF did not appear to improve visual and anatomical outcomes. Conclusions Symptomatic CCHs respond generally well to PDT. Patients with younger age (< 50 years), pretreatment BCVA≥ 20/200, and thinner foveal edema are most likely to benefit from this approach."

In the first, a ""veggie-heavy"" entrée was added at the beginning of the entrée line, so that students would substitute an entrée containing vegetables for the alternatives. In the second, a snack-food bar was set up to cater to students who didn't want to stand in the long entrée line, and preferred a snack. Data on food choice was collected during the interventions. Survey responses showed significant differences in the reasons females and males utilized late-night dining (p<0.001). We also found that students at late-night dining had a lower emphasis on health than the general student population. Even students at late-night who reported being health-conscious showed no difference in food selections from students who said health was not important (p = 0.883). Veggie-heavy entrées had mild success in increasing vegetable selection. However, veggie-heavy entrées were largely ignored when the other option was chicken nuggets. The snack bar was very popular.

However, targeting ROR1 with small-molecules has been challenging due to the absence of ROR1 kinase activity. To identify genes that regulate ROR1 expression and may, therefore, serve as surrogate drug targets, we employed an siRNA screening approach and determined that the epigenetic regulator and E3 ubiquitin ligase, UHRF1, is required for t(1;19) pre-B-ALL cell viability in a ROR1-dependent manner. Upon UHRF1 silencing, ROR1 protein is reduced without altering ROR1 mRNA, and ectopically expressed UHRF1 is sufficient to increase ROR1 levels. Additionally, proteasome inhibition rescues loss of ROR1 protein after UHRF1 silencing, suggesting a role for the proteasome in the UHRF1-ROR1 axis. Finally, we show that ROR1-positive cells are twice as sensitive to the UHRF1-targeting drug, naphthazarin, and undergo increased apoptosis compared to ROR1-negative cells. Naphthazarin elicits reduced expression of UHRF1 and ROR1, and combination of naphthazarin with inhibitors of pre-B cell receptor signaling results in further reduction of cell survival compared with either inhibitor alone. Therefore, our work reveals a mechanism by which UHRF1 stabilizes ROR1, suggesting a potential targeting strategy to inhibit ROR1 in t(1;19) pre-B-ALL and other malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2806866794,"X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a retinal degenerative disorder caused by mutations in RS1 gene leading to splitting of retinal layers (schisis) which impairs visual signal processing. Retinoschisin (RS1) is an adhesive protein which is secreted predominantly by the photoreceptors and bipolar cells as a double-octameric complex. In general, XLRS patients show wide clinical heterogeneity, presenting practical challenges in disease management. Though researchers have attempted various approaches to offer an explanation for clinical heterogeneity, the molecular basis has not been understood yet. Therefore, this study aims at establishing a link between the phenotype and genotype based on the molecular mechanism exerted by the mutations. Twenty seven XLRS patients were enrolled, of which seven harboured novel mutations. The mutant constructs were genetically engineered and their secretion profiles were studied by in vitro cell culture experiments. Based on the secretory profile, the patients were categorized as either secreted or non-secreted group. Various clinical parameters such as visual acuity, location of schisis, foveal thickness and ERG parameters were compared between the two groups and control. Although the two groups showed severe disease phenotype in comparison with control, there was no significant difference between the two XLRS groups. However, the secreted group exhibited relatively severe disease indications. On the other hand molecular analysis suggests that most of the RS1 mutations result in intracellular retention of retinoschisin. Hence, clinical parameters of patients with non-secreted profile were analyzed which in turn revealed wide variability even within the group. Altogether, our results indicate that disease severity is not merely dependent on secretory profile of the mutations. Thus, we hypothesize that intricate molecular detail such as the precise localization of mutant protein in the cell as well as its ability to assemble into a functionally active oligomer might largely influence disease severity among XLRS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2807282620,"Background Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)—such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF)—are typically diseases of the elderly caused by acquired somatic mutations. However, it is largely unknown how the malignant clone interferes with normal hematopoiesis. In this study, we analyzed if serum of MPN patients comprises soluble factors that impact on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPCs). Methods CD34+ HPCs were cultured in medium supplemented with serum samples of PV, ET, or MF patients, or healthy controls. The impact on proliferation, maintenance of immature hematopoietic surface markers, and colony forming unit (CFU) potential was systematically analyzed. In addition, we compared serum of healthy young (<25 years) and elderly donors (>50 years) to determine how normal aging impacts on the hematopoiesis-supportive function of serum. Results Serum from MF, PV and ET patients significantly increased proliferation as compared to controls. In addition, serum from MF and ET patients attenuated the loss of a primitive immunophenotype during in vitro culture. The CFU counts were significantly higher if HPCs were cultured with serum of MPN patients as compared to controls. Furthermore, serum of healthy young versus old donors did not evoke significant differences in proliferation or immunophenotype of HPCs, whereas the CFU frequency was significantly increased by serum from elderly patients. Conclusion Our results indicate that serum derived from patients with MPN comprises activating feedback signals that stimulate the HPCs–and this stimulatory signal may result in a viscous circle that further accelerates development of the disease."

The special impact on the reaction mechanism and kinetics, e.g. on the formation of mono-, di- and trihydroxymethyl derivatives of phenol (PhOH) is a consequence of the type and amount of the catalyst. This paper presents the results of optimisation research of resol resin synthesis catalysed by trimethylamine (TEA) carried out according to 32 experimental design. The aim of the research was to determine the synthesis conditions under which it is possible to achieve products with reduced content of unconverted formaldehyde (CH2O), phenol and its hydroxymetyl derivatives, while maintaining the required physico-chemical properties. The process employing selected polyamines as well as TEA together with polyamine co-catalysts i.e. diethylenetriamine (DETA) and triethylenetetraamine (TETA) was also studied. The results were compared with those of the resins which were synthesised with the use of classic catalysts-ammonia (NH3) and triethylamine for which the content of CH2O, PhOH and its hydroxymethyl derivatives was respectively: NH3-5.13% and 46.27%, TEA-0.33% and 52.41%. In the case DETA was added, the content of phenol and its hydroxymethyl derivatives could be reduced by 52.49% in relation to the resin obtained with the use of TEA and by 46.19% in relation to the resin obtained with the use of ammonia. The formaldehyde content was reduced by 78.79% and 98.64%, respectively. When TETA was added as a co-catalyst, the content of phenol and its derivatives was reduced by 48.04% versus triethylamine-catalysed resin and by 41.15% versus ammonia-catalysed material. The reduction in formaldehyde content reached 84.85% and 99.03%, respectively. The results of kinetic study were also presented, the prediction accuracy of the proposed kinetic model is more than 98% for all the catalysts in the state variable space. Polyamine co-catalysts gave much higher rate constants (0.50 and 0.45 for TETA and DETA, respectively)."

Methods The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database was used to identify 833 glaucoma patients based on ophthalmologic examinations. The adjusted mean utility values, calculated by EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L), of glaucoma patients according to patient demographics and measures of glaucoma severity were determined using multivariate linear regression analysis. Results The mean utility value of glaucoma patients was 0.8968. Patients aged 70 years or more had significantly lower utility value (0.86, p value 0.005) compared to those aged less than 50 years (0.96). Patients within the lowest quartile of income had a utility value of 0.87, compared to a utility value of 0.96 for those within the highest quartile (p value 0.001). Patients who were not married had lower utility value (0.87) compared to married patients (0.93). Patients within the lowest quartile of worse eye frequency doubling technology (FDT) score had lower utility value (0.88) compared to those within the highest quartile (0.94). Finally, bilateral vision loss patients had significantly lower utility value (0.83, p value 0.013) compared to patients without vision loss (0.92). Conclusion The present study assessed utility values of Korean glaucoma patients. The quality of life determined by EQ-5D-3L in Korean glaucoma patients was higher compared to those in other countries. Patient demographics as well as measures of disease severity were important factors in determining the quality of life within glaucoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2806412879,"Arbuscular Mycorrhiza and Root Nodule Symbiosis are symbiotic interactions with a high benefit for plant growth and crop production. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the developmental process of these symbioses in detail. We analysed very early symbiotic responses of Medicago truncatula root hair cells, by stimulation with lipochitinoligosaccharides specific for the induction of nodules (Nod-LCOs), or the interaction with mycorrhiza (Myc-LCOs). Intracellular micro electrodes were used, in combination with Ca2+ sensitive reporter dyes, to study the relations between cytosolic Ca2+ signals and membrane potential changes. We found that sulfated Myc- as well as Nod-LCOs initiate a membrane depolarization, which depends on the chemical composition of these signaling molecules, as well as the genotype of the plants that were studied. A successive application of sulfated Myc-LCOs and Nod-LCOs resulted only in a single transient depolarization, indicating that Myc-LCOs can repress plasma membrane responses to Nod-LCOs. In contrast to current models, the Nod-LCO-induced depolarization precedes changes in the cytosolic Ca2+ level of root hair cells. The Nod-LCO induced membrane depolarization thus is most likely independent of cytosolic Ca2+ signals and nuclear Ca2+ spiking."
https://openalex.org/W2806767015,"Purpose 
To distinguish clinical factors that have time-varying (as opposed to constant) impact upon patient and graft survival among pediatric liver transplant recipients.


Methods 
Using national data from 2002 through 2013, we examined potential clinical and demographic covariates using Gray’s piecewise constant time-varying coefficients (TVC) models. For both patient and graft survival, we estimated univariable and multivariable Gray’s TVC, retaining significant covariates based on backward selection. We then estimated the same specification using traditional Cox proportional hazards (PH) models and compared our findings.


Results 
For patient survival, covariates included recipient diagnosis, age, race/ethnicity, ventilator support, encephalopathy, creatinine levels, use of living donor, and donor age. Only the effects of recipient diagnosis and donor age were constant; effects of other covariates varied over time. We retained identical covariates in the graft survival model but found several differences in their impact.


Conclusion 
The flexibility afforded by Gray’s TVC estimation methods identify several covariates that do not satisfy constant proportionality assumptions of the Cox PH model. Incorporating better survival estimates is critical for improving risk prediction tools used by the transplant community to inform organ allocation decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2806969764,"Human central nervous system (CNS) undergoes neurological changes during the aging process, leading to declines in hand and finger functions. Previous studies have shown that the CNS can independently process multi-finger force control and moment of force control. However, if both force and moment control are simultaneously imposed by motor task constraints, the CNS needs to resolve competing interests of generating negative and positive covariances between fingers, respectively, which causes “conflict of interest or COI”. Here, we investigated how aging affects the CNS’s abilities to solve COI through a new experimental paradigm. Both elderly and young subjects performed a constant force production task using index and middle fingers under two conditions, multi-finger pressing with no COI and with COI. We found that the elderly increased variance of a virtual finger (VF: an imagined finger producing the same mechanical effect as both fingers together) in time-to-time basis (i.e. online control), while increasing covariance between individual fingers (IF) forces in trial-to-trial basis (i.e. offline control) with COI than no COI. Aging affects the CNS’s abilities to solve COI by deteriorating VF actions in online control and IF actions in offline control."
https://openalex.org/W2952280810,"It is difficult to target and kill cancer cells. One possible approach is to mutate bacteria to enhance their binding to cancer cells. In the present study, Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis were randomly mutated, and then were positively and negatively selected for binding cancer vs normal cells. With repetitive mutation and selection both bacteria successfully evolved to increase affinity to the pancreatic cancer cell line (Mia PaCa-2) but not normal cells (HPDE: immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells). The mutant E. coli and B. subtilis strains bound to Mia PaCa-2 cells about 10 and 25 times more than to HPDE cells. The selected E. coli strain had mutations in biofilm-related genes and the regulatory region for a type I pilus gene. Consistent with type I pili involvement, mannose could inhibit the binding to cells. The results suggest that weak but specific binding is involved in the initial step of adhesion. To test their ability to kill Mia PaCa-2 cells, hemolysin was expressed in the mutant strain. The hemolysin released from the mutant strain was active and could kill Mia PaCa-2 cells. In the case of B. subtilis, the initial binding to the cells was a weak interaction of the leading pole of the motile bacteria. The frequency of this interaction to Mia PaCa-2 cells dramatically increased in the evolved mutant strain. This mutant strain could also specifically invade beneath Mia PaCa-2 cells and settle there. This type of mutation/selection strategy may be applicable to other combinations of cancer cells and bacterial species."
