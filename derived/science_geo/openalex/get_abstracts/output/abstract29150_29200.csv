https://openalex.org/W1508641020,"The differentiation of mammalian urothelium culminates in the formation of asymmetrical unit membrane (AUM). Using gradient centrifugation and detergent wash, we purified milligram quantities of AUMs which, interestingly, contained three major proteins (15, 27, and 47 kDa) that appeared to be identical to the three immunoaffinity purified, putatively AUM-associated proteins that we described earlier (Yu, J., Manabe, M., Wu, X.-R., Xu, C., Surya, B., and Sun, T.-T. (1990) J. Cell Biol., 111, 1207-1216). Peptide mapping and immunoblotting established that these three proteins were distinct molecules. Using monospecific antibodies to these three proteins, we showed that they were all restricted to the superficial urothelial cells and were AUM-associated. The 27- and 15-kDa proteins were detected exclusively on the luminal side of mature, apical AUMs. In contrast, epitopes of the 47-kDa protein were detected on both sides of apical AUMs suggesting a transmembranous configuration. These results (i) provide the strongest evidence thus far that AUM contains three major proteins (the 27-kDa uroplakin I, 15-kDa uroplakin II, and 47-kDa uroplakin III) which form an extremely insoluble complex, (ii) suggest that uroplakin II, like uroplakin I (Yu, J., Manabe, M., Wu, X.-R., Xu, C., Surya, B., and Sun, T.-T. (1990) J. Cell. Biol. 111, 1207-1216), translocates from one side of the membrane to another during AUM maturation, (iii) indicate that uroplakin III may play a different structural role than uroplakins I and II in AUM formation, and (iv) establish the three uroplakins as markers for an advanced stage of urothelial differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1522262409,"Bactenecins are highly cationic polypeptides of the large granules of bovine neutrophils, exerting in vitro a potent antimicrobial activity. Two bactenecins, with an approximate molecular weight of 7000 and 5000, called Bac7 and Bac5, are characterized by a high content of proline (greater than 45%) and arginine (greater than 23%) residues. Their complete amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation combined, in the case of Bac5, with plasma desorption mass spectrometry. Bac7 comprises 59 residues and includes three tandem repeats of a tetradecamer characterized by several Pro-Arg-Pro triplets spaced by single hydrophobic amino acids. Resolution of the primary structure of Bac5 required fragmentation with N-bromosuccinimide as well as digestion of the obtained C-terminal fragment with carboxypeptidases P and Y directly in the mass spectrometer. Bac5 comprises 42 amino acid residues with a repeated motif of Arg-Pro-Pro triplets also alternating with single apolar residues."
https://openalex.org/W1524172089,"The mitochondrial DNA of Trypanosoma brucei is organized as a catenated network of maxicircles and minicircles. The maxicircles are equivalent to the typical mitochondrial genome except that the genes for the mitochondrial tRNAs have not been identified by sequence analysis of the maxicircle DNA. The apparent absence of tRNA genes in the maxicircle DNA suggests that the mitochondrial tRNAs are encoded by either the minicircle or the nuclear DNA. In order to determine their genomic origin, we isolated and identified the mitochondrial tRNAs of T. brucei. We show that these mitochondrial tRNAs are truly mitochondrially located in vivo and that they are free from detectable contamination by cytosolic RNAs. By hybridization analysis, using mitochondrial tRNAs as the probe, we determined that the mitochondrial tRNAs are encoded by nuclear DNA. This implies that RNAs, like proteins, are imported into the mitochondria. We investigated the relationship between the cytosolic and the mitochondrial tRNA genes and show that there are unique cytosolic tRNA genes, unique mitochondrial tRNA genes, and tRNA genes which appear to be shared and whose products are therefore targeted to both the cytosol and the mitochondrion."

https://openalex.org/W1541161575,"OmpA is an integral membrane protein from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Purified, lipopolysaccharide-free OmpA was denatured by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Refolding was then induced by replacement of SDS with the nonionic detergent octylglucoside. The structure of both the denatured and refolded protein were investigated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, protease digestion, Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Refolded OmpA could be reconstituted into membranes of the synthetic lipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. Thus, lipopolysaccharide is neither necessary for proper folding of OmpA nor for its insertion into lipid membranes. Based on this result, models for sorting of OmpA into the outer membrane of E. coli are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1504520038,"dnaA protein isolated from Escherichia coli is equally distributed between a monomeric form, which is active for initiation of DNA replication, and an inactive, aggregated form which contains phospholipids. Replication activity of the aggregated form can be restored by treatments with either dnaK protein or phospholipase A2. Dissociation of the aggregate by dnaK protein is driven by ATP hydrolysis; action by phospholipase A2 requires a minute concentration of ATP only to stabilize the dissociated protein. Conversion of inactive dnaA-phospholipid complexes to the active form may contribute to the regulation of the initiation of chromosomal replication in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1556603878,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA is modified by a posttranscriptional editing reaction in which a single base (C to U) change in apoB100 mRNA modifies a glutamine (CAA) to a translational stop codon (UAA), producing apoB48 mRNA in mammalian intestine. Rat liver normally contains both edited and unedited apoB mRNAs and previous work (Davidson, N. O., Powell, L. M., Wallis, S. C., and Scott, J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13482-13485) has demonstrated that the introduction of a translational stop codon can be modulated by thyroid hormone. In the current study, hepatic lipogenesis was modulated in vivo by fasting and refeeding a high carbohydrate diet, a maneuver which produced a 30-fold increase in hepatic triglyceride content. In this setting, hepatic apoB100 synthesis became undetectable in animals subjected to 48 h fasting and subsequently refed a high carbohydrate diet for either 24 or 48 h. This change was accountable for by an increase in the proportion of edited apoB mRNA, as determined by primer extension analysis, from 37% UAA in fasted animals to 79 and 91% UAA at 24 and 48 h of refeeding, respectively. The effect of this regimen on the expression of other hepatic apolipoprotein genes was less dramatic. ApoA-I and apoA-IV gene expression was modulated over a 2-fold range, in contrast to the (6-14-fold) pretranslational changes induced by thyroid hormone administration. ApoCIII mRNA abundance was unaltered in the setting of either fasting and refeeding or thyroid hormone administration, while apoE gene expression demonstrated a pretranslational increase following prolonged fasting. Taken together the data provide evidence that apoB mRNA editing is modulated by alterations in hepatic lipogenesis which additionally produce effects on the expression of other hepatic apolipoprotein genes suggesting that they are not coordinately regulated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1523078511,"A large number of new substrates for anion uniport by the uncoupling protein of brown adipose tissue mitochondria have been found. These include alkylsulfonates, alkylsulfates and their derivatives, benzenesulfonate, oxohalogenides, hypophosphate, hexafluorophosphate, and pyruvate. Although the spectrum of anion selectivity is far wider than had previously been suspected, there are strong structural requirements for transport. The anion must be monovalent, and polar groups must not be attached to alkyl or aryl chains. The most striking finding is that transport increases dramatically with anion hydrophobicity. Anions that are transported are shown to compete with Cl- for transport by the reconstituted uncoupling protein. For each anion, the Ki for GDP inhibition of transport increases with its rate of transport and correlates inversely with its Ki for competitive inhibition of Cl- transport. For alkylsulfonates, transport rate, Ki for GDP inhibition, and Ki for inhibition of Cl- transport each depend monotonically on alkyl chain length. These findings suggest several new hypotheses relating to the molecular mechanism of transport through uncoupling protein and suggest explanations for observed functional differences among porters belonging to the same gene family."

https://openalex.org/W1600693330,"The mechanism by which the murein sacculus of Escherichia coli is being enlarged during growth was investigated by pulse and pulse-chase labeling with [3H]diaminopimelic acid. Changes in the composition of the sacculus during aging were analyzed in detail by high performance liquid chromatography separation of the muropeptide subunits released after complete muramidase digestion. After pulses as short as 10 s, a group of novel phosphorylated muropeptides was detected. The kinetics of their appearance is consistent with these structures being derived from the undecaprenylphosphate-linked growing points of murein. A complex maturation process of murein took place including a rapid decay of pentapeptide side chains and a 10-fold increase in tripeptidyl moieties. In addition, the total degree of cross-linkage increased from 16 to 25%, partly due to a 3-fold increase in the formation of LD-A2pm-A2pm cross-links. In pulse-chase experiments the cross-linkage started to decrease after a maximum at about 35 min of chase. The kinetics in the distribution of the radioactivity among acceptor and donor part in the major cross-bridges Tetra-Tetra and Tetra-Tri differed from each other substantially, indicating that the latter structure is completely cleaved within three generations, whereas only 40% of Tetra-Tetra is cleaved during the same time. Furthermore, the attachment of the lipoprotein to murein was delayed by about one generation. It is proposed that these findings reflect an inside-to-outside growth mechanism of the murein sacculus of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1575449179,"The reaction of cyanide metmyoglobin with dithionite conforms to a two-step sequential mechanism with formation of an unstable intermediate, identified as cyanide bound ferrous myoglobin. This reaction was investigated by stopped-flow time resolved spectroscopy using different myoglobins, i.e. those from horse heart, Aplysia limacina buccal muscle, and three recombinant derivatives of sperm whale skeletal muscle myoglobin (Mb) (the wild type and two mutants). The myoglobins from horse and sperm whale (wild type) have in the distal position (E7) a histidyl residue, which is missing in A. limacina Mb as well as the two sperm whale mutants (E7 His----Gly and E7 His----Val). All these proteins in the reduced form display an extremely low affinity for cyanide at pH less than 10. The differences in spectroscopy and kinetics of the ferrous cyanide complex of these myoglobins indicate a role of the distal pocket on the properties of the complex. The two mutants of sperm whale Mb are characterized by a rate constant for the decay of the unstable intermediate much faster than that of the wild type, at all pH values explored. Therefore, we envisage a specific role of the distal His (E7) in controlling the rate of cyanide dissociation and also find that this effect depends on the protonation of a single ionizable group, with pK = 7.2, attributed to the E7 imidazole ring. The results on A. limacina Mb, which displays the slowest rate of cyanide dissociation, suggests that a considerable stabilizing effect can be exerted by Arg E10 which, according to Bolognesi et al. (Bolognesi, M., Coda, A., Frigerio, F., Gatti, C., Ascenzi, P., and Brunori, M. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 213, 621-625), interacts inside the pocket with fluoride bound to the ferric heme iron. A mechanism of control for the rate of dissociation of cyanide from ferrous myoglobin, involving protonation of the bound anion, is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1520247815,"The role of the electrochemical potential difference of proton (delta mu H+) in protein translocation across the membrane of Escherichia coli was examined in detail using an efficient in vitro assay system (Yamada, H., Tokuda, H., and Mizushima, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1723-1728). Delta mu H+ reduced the level of ATP necessary for the efficient translocation of OmpF-Lpp, a chimeric model secretory protein. The apparent Km value of the translocation reaction for ATP was lower by 2 orders of magnitude in the presence of delta mu H+ than in its absence. The membrane potential and delta pH, both of which are components of delta mu H+, independently lowered the apparent Km value of the translocation reaction for ATP. An ATP-generating system also lowered the level of ATP required for translocation in the absence of delta mu H+ but not in its presence. It is proposed that ADP formed during protein translocation lowers the affinity of the putative translocation machinery for ATP and that the removal of ADP from the secretory machinery, a possible critical step in the translocation reaction, is stimulated in the presence of either delta mu H+, an ATP-generating system, or a higher concentration of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1568101544,"The initial events of visual transduction occur on disc membranes which are sequestered within the photoreceptor outer segment. In rod cells, the discs are stacked in the outer segment. Discs are formed at the base of the rod outer segment (ROS) from evaginations of the plasma membrane. As new discs form, older discs move toward the apical tip of the rod, from which they are eventually shed and subsequently phagocytosed by the adjacent pigment epithelium. Thus, disc membranes within a given rod cell are not of uniform age. We have recently shown that disc membranes are not homogeneous with respect to cholesterol content (Boesze-Battaglia, K., Hennessey, T., and Albert, A. D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8151-8155). In the present study, freshly isolated bovine retinas were incubated with [3H]leucine for 4 h in order to allow sufficient time for the radiolabeled proteins to become incorporated into the basal-most (newest) discs. Osmotically intact discs were then isolated. After the addition of digitonin, the discs were fractionated based on cholesterol content, and radioactivity (indicative of newly synthesized protein) was measured. Discs which exhibited high cholesterol content also exhibited high radio-activity. These results demonstrate that the cholesterol heterogeneity of ROS disc membranes is related to the age, and thus the position, of the discs in the ROS."
https://openalex.org/W1560402341,"The fluorescent anion indicator 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium was trapped in proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified 32-kDa uncoupling protein and used to detect GDP-sensitive uniports of Cl-, Br-, and I-. Transport of these halide anions was rapid and potential-dependent. F- and nitrate were found to inhibit Cl- uptake competitively, suggesting that these anions are also substrates for transport. This preparation also exhibited H+(OH-) transport, showing that the reconstituted uncoupling protein possesses both halide and H+ transport functions, as is observed in intact brown adipose tissue mitochondria. Cl- transport was inhibited to the residual level observed in liposomes without protein when GDP was present on both sides of the membrane. Cl- transport was inhibited by about 50% when GDP was present only on one side of the membrane. We infer that uncoupling protein reconstitutes into proteoliposomes with a 1:1 ratio of sidedness orientation. The Km values for Cl- uniport were 100 and 65 mM, respectively, in GDP-loaded and non-GDP-loaded vesicles. Participation of the inner membrane anion channel in the observed transport is rendered unlikely by the fact that this carrier is insensitive to GDP. A variety of additional experiments probing for inner membrane anion channel yielded uniformly negative results, confirming the absence of contamination by this protein. Our results therefore demonstrate that the uncoupling protein mediates anion translocation, a function previously reported as lacking in the reconstituted system."
https://openalex.org/W1603633452,"The amino-terminal presequences of proteins imported from the cytoplasm across the mitochondrial inner membrane are cleaved off by a soluble matrix-localized protease composed of two nonidentical homologous subunits. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these are encoded by the nuclear MAS1 and MAS2 genes. We have now constructed yeast strains in which either one or both of the genomic MAS genes are controlled by a galactose-inducible strong promoter. In these strains, the intramitochondrial concentration of each MAS-encoded subunit as well as of the holo-protease can be varied over a wide range. When overproduced, the MAS1 protein precipitates in the matrix whereas the MAS2 protein remains soluble. The MAS2 protein was obtained at a purity of 98% in milligram amounts. The purified MAS2 subunit exists largely as a soluble 52-kDa monomer. Its cleavage activity is very low and might well reflect the 2% contamination by holoprotease. Activity is restored by adding the solubilized purified MAS1 subunit. Yeast cells depleted of one or both MAS subunits continue to import precursor proteins into mitochondria, but fail to cleave them; eventually the deficient cells stop growing. This growth arrest is partly suppressed on minimal medium or under conditions in which the cells are less dependent on mitochondrial metabolism. Depletion of the MAS1 subunit causes overproduction of the MAS2 subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1586439170,"The cap structure in human U6 small nuclear (sn)RNA, gamma-monomethylguanosine triphosphate (meGTP), was conjugated to human serum albumin and used as antigen to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. The resulting antibodies reacted specifically with meGTP but not with GTP, GDP, GMP, meGMP, meATP, meCTP, meUTP, or with methyl phosphate in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or in radioimmunoassays. Although less efficiently, meGDP was also recognized by these antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence studies with anti-meGTP antibodies showed predominantly nuclear immunofluorescence. Anti-meGTP antibodies immunoprecipitated intact U6 snRNA from a mixture of HeLa cell RNAs. In addition to the U6 snRNA, anti-meGTP antibodies immunoprecipitated several additional small RNAs that varied in length from approximately 50 to 330 nucleotides. These RNAs contained the meGTP cap structure and are structurally distinct from U6 snRNA. One of these meGTP-containing RNAs was found to be previously characterized 7SK RNA; human 7SK RNA synthesized in vitro also contained the same cap structure. Results obtained in this study provide evidence for the presence of gamma-monomethyl-GTP cap structure in a wide spectrum of human cellular RNAs. These antibodies will be useful in studying the structure and function of this new family of small RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1849682393,"An hereditary abnormal antithrombin III (ATIII Geneva) with defective heparin cofactor activity was characterized by DNA single strand amplification and subsequent direct sequencing. ATIII Geneva was found to have a G to A transition in Exon IIIa leading to an Arg-129 to Gln mutation. This amino acid is part of the ATIII region comprising residues 114-154, which contains the highest proportion of basic residues (Arg or Lys), and is known from chemical modification studies to be involved in heparin binding. The variant protein did not bind heparin-Sepharose and was isolated from the propositus plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography. High affinity (for ATIII) heparin had only a minimal effect on thrombin and activated factor X inhibition by the purified abnormal ATIII. Taken together, these results demonstrate an important role for Arg-129 in the binding and interaction of ATIII with heparin of high affinity. We propose that a cooperation between Lys-125, Arg-129, Lys-136, and Arg-47 exposed at the surface of the inhibitor allows the binding of the essential pentasaccharide domain of heparin which is specific for the ATIII interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1533764651,"During the differentiation of C2 myoblasts into differentiated myotubes, there is a marked decrease in the abundance of c-myc mRNA. c-myc transcription initiation and elongation do not change significantly, but the turnover of c-myc transcripts appears to be accelerated during differentiation. We examined the expression of several recombinant c-myc genes introduced into C2 cells by stable transfection and found that mRNAs containing the c-myc protein-coding region of exons 2 and 3 are appropriately regulated; the upstream c-myc sequences, the long leader sequence encoded by c-myc exon 1, and the 3' untranslated region are dispensible for proper regulation. Regulation appears to affect c-myc transcripts that are bound to polyribosomes, and the mRNA from a gene with a point mutation in the translation initiation codon is no longer properly regulated. We conclude that down-regulation of c-myc expression during myogenesis is post-transcriptional and requires the presence of sequences encoding the c-myc protein in a form that can be translated."

Based on these results, we discuss important steps of the mechanism of general genetic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1573824667,"The interaction of chicken gizzard caldesmon with fragments of tropomyosin, generated by chemical, enzymatic, and mutational means, was studied to determine the caldesmon-binding site(s) on tropomyosin. Binding was examined by fluorescence spectroscopy and affinity chromatography. Removal of residues 1-141 and 228-284, respectively, from the NH2 and COOH ends of tropomyosin did not affect its binding to caldesmon significantly, indicating that the major, caldesmon-binding region lies between residues 142-227. The Escherichia coli produced chicken gizzard beta-tropomyosin mutant, CSM-beta (1/8/12-227), bound caldesmon about 2-fold stronger than a similar mutant of residues 8-200. This further focused the primary caldesmon-binding site to residues 201-227. Cleavage of tropomyosin at CYS-190 weakened markedly the binding of the two resulting fragments, residues 1-189 and 190-284, to caldesmon suggesting the requirement for the integrity of the caldesmon-binding region between residues 142227 of tropomyosin for strong interaction with caldesmon. Based on data from this study and others, we have proposed models for the interaction of tropomyosin with caldesmon in vitro, as well as the possible arrangement of the smooth muscle thin filament proteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1656852118,"Plasma membranes of ovarian luteal and adrenal cortical cells from channels, a unique extracellular compartment formed by the close apposition of flattened microvillar surfaces. Microvillar channels have unusual affinity for cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, and, in vivo, may provide an increased surface area for these particles. In this research, we have isolated a plasma membrane-enriched fraction from rat luteinized ovaries, in which closely apposed membrane (i.e. microvillar channels) comprise about 30% of the preparation. Following in vitro incubations (approximately 1 h) of this plasma membrane fraction with different plasma lipoproteins, the closely apposed plasma membrane surfaces widen and become filled with lipoprotein particles (up to about 30 nm), whereas other membranes of the fraction show little binding. Competition experiments show that rat high density lipoproteins have the highest affinity for binding to the plasma membrane fraction. Radiolabeled plasma lipoprotein and the tissue-specific hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, showed specific and saturable binding to the plasma membrane fraction, whereas other macromolecules used as controls did not. Radioautographic analyses of 125I-labeled lipoproteins and human chorionic gonadotropin indicate that binding occurs predominantly to the closely apposed plasma membranes (i.e. microvillar channels of the fraction). These studies show that microvillar channels of steroid-secreting cells entrap large numbers of plasma lipoproteins, particularly high density lipoproteins particles, presumably functioning in the delivery of cholesterol to these cells."

https://openalex.org/W1573530429,"We have studied the effect of GDP and its analog guanyl-5'-yl thiophosphate (GDP beta S) on the interaction between rhodopsin and transducin (Gt). Stabilization of the light-induced active intermediate, metarhodopsin II (MII), by bound Gt (extra-MII effect) monitored the catalytic interaction between the proteins. Extra-MII can be completely abolished by GDP, with a half-suppression at 10 microM under the conditions (4 degrees C, pH 8, 7.5 nM photoactivated rhodopsin). The effect of GDP did not depend on divalent cations, in contrast to GTP-induced dissociation of the complex. The GDP analog GDP beta S did not affect extra-MII although it binds to the MII-Gt complex with only three times lower affinity (reversal of the GDP effect by GDP beta S). However, GDP beta S enhanced considerably the efficiency of synthetic rhodopsin peptide competition against the formation of extra-MII. GDP and GDP beta S slow the Gt activation rate (monitored by kinetic light scattering), with the same relative efficiencies. We therefore assume that GDP, GDP beta S, and GTP bind at the same site. We discuss a generalized induced fit mechanism, where MII induces opening of the Gt nucleotide site and release of GDP which in turn is obligatory to establish the MII-stabilizing rhodopsin-Gt three-loop interaction (Konig, B., Arendt, A., McDowell, J.H., Kahlert, M., Hargrave, P.A., and Hofmann, K.P. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 6878-6882). The GDP beta S/GDP difference is discussed in terms of bound GDP disturbing the interaction with two and GDP beta S with only one of the rhodopsin binding sites. Mechanistically, our results indicate a critical role of the beta-phosphate interaction with the nucleotide binding site in the GDP-induced transformation of Gt."
https://openalex.org/W1541004586,"The incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol shows that FRTL-5 cells possess an active cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. When these cells were made quiescent, and synchronized by thyrotropin (TSH) starvation, in the presence of low serum (0.2%), addition of this hormone increased acetate conversion into cholesterol up to a maximum of 8-fold. Feedback inhibition of sterol synthesis by exogenous cholesterol occurs in FRTL-5 cells since, in the presence of higher serum concentration (5%), acetate conversion into cholesterol was significantly depressed. Even in high serum TSH increased sterol synthesis, albeit to a lesser extent. The time course of the TSH effect cholesterol synthesis, strongly suggests that this process is necessary for quiescent FRTL-5 cells to enter the cell cycle. Thus, the rate of cholesterol synthesis was maximal 12-16 h after TSH challenge and declined thereafter, returning to levels slightly above the basal at 48 h. Thymidine incorporation into DNA, measured under identical conditions of TSH starvation/challenge, increased after 20 h, was maximal at 36 h, and returned to pre-TSH level at 70 h. The effect of TSH cholesterol synthesis is not a general feature of lipid synthesis in FRTL-5 since [14C]acetate incorporation into triglycerides after TSH treatment has a different magnitude and time course. TSH increases cholesterol synthesis through the induction of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. This is due to an increase in the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase messenger RNA up to 8-fold caused by a proportional increase in the rate of gene transcription, as assessed by nuclear run on experiments. The effect of TSH cholesterol synthesis and reductase gene expression is likely to be mediated by cAMP since 8-bromo-cAMP mimicked the effect of the hormone. The data presented suggest that an active cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is required for DNA synthesis to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1506613684,"Recent studies suggest that a retinoic acid (RA) nuclear receptor or a retinoylated nuclear protein may be involved in the action of RA. We showed previously (Takahashi, N., and Breitman, T. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5159-5163) that retinoylation involves the formation of a thioester bond and occurs on protein in newly formed cells and in pre-existing cells. In this study, we saw at least 14 retinoylated proteins in HL-60 cells. Greater than 90% of the retinoylation was associated with the nuclear protein described previously. This protein, partially purified from isolated nuclei, bound to DNA-cellulose and was eluted with NaCl. Retinoylation occurred in HL-60 cells exposed to cycloheximide. Thus, retinoylation resembled palmitoylation, both in the covalent bond and the exchangeable reaction involving preformed protein. These similarities prompted us to compare retinoylation with two other fatty acylations in growing HL-60 cells. We found that the major retinoylated protein was labeled by either radioactive palmitic acid or myristic acid. The extent of [3H]palmitic acid labeling of this protein was not reduced by growth in the presence of RA. The extent of retinoylation of this protein was not reduced by growth in the presence of increasing concentrations of palmitic acid. These results raise the possibility that the same protein is a substrate for retinoylation, palmitoylation, and myristoylation."
https://openalex.org/W1588464625,"Stimulation of cultured bovine chromaffin cells with histamine (10(-5) M), nicotine (10(-6) M), and veratridine (2 x 10(-6) M) results in a time-dependent up to 5-fold increase in proenkephalin (Penk) mRNA levels. After an initial lag phase (with no major alterations) Penk mRNA increased markedly between 6 and 12 h followed by a slower, steady increase up to 48 h. The nicotinic receptor antagonist tubocurarine (4 x 10(-7) M) and the Ca2+ channel blocker D600 (10(-5) M) prevent the subsequent rise of Penk mRNA levels after challenge with nicotine, when given within the lag phase (0-6 h), suggesting the need of continuous receptor occupation and Ca2+ entry for induction of gene expression. Similarly, incubation of chromaffin cells with cycloheximide (10(-6) M), given at 0-6 h, blocks the increase in Penk mRNA after stimulation with histamine and nicotine indicating that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary for the delayed rise of Penk mRNA. Nuclear run-off experiments revealed high transcription levels of the Penk gene (3-fold at 2 h) and the tyrosine hydroxylase gene (7-fold at 20 min) following stimulation with histamine, which was not observed in the presence of cycloheximide (10(-5) M). A more rapid induction of transcription was measured for the c-fos gene after histamine stimulation (high levels after 12 min) followed by c-fos mRNA accumulation (about 20-fold after a 1-h stimulation), which was superinduced when cells were pretreated with cycloheximide. The half-life of Penk mRNA levels (about 12 h), however, seems not to be affected by histamine as suggested by measurement of the subsequent decay of Penk mRNA levels after addition of alpha-amanitin or alpha-amanitin and cycloheximide. Thus, activation of Penk gene expression upon neurotransmitter challenge is suggested to be due to an enhanced transcriptional activity of the gene mediated by de novo synthesized protein (-like) factors."

Affinity chromatography of cyanogen bromide-cleaved type II collagen on immobilized fibronectin revealed the binding of cyanogen bromide fragment CB12 in addition to the previously characterized CB10. Using fluorescence polarization, we analyzed the interaction between the collagen peptides and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled 42-kDa gelatin-binding fragment of fibronectin in solution. Dissociation constants for the binding of CB10 and CB12 to the fibronectin fragment were calculated as 0.38 and 0.94 microM, respectively, indicating a lower affinity for the uncharacterized site. However, as with CB10, CB12 was able to compete effectively with the intact alpha chain for bindinng to fibronectin. Additionally, both CB10 and CB12 absorbed to tissue culture surfaces were each able to support fibronectin-dependent cell adhesion. Finally, the regions of alpha 2(I) homologous to CB12 and CB10 were found to be active in fibronectin binding, demonstrating the presence of two fibronectin-binding regions in this collagen chain."
https://openalex.org/W1601354203,"The bacteriophage T4 regA protein is a translational repressor of a group of T4 early mRNAs. We have characterized the binding of regA protein to polynucleotides and to specific RNAs. Binding to nucleic acids was monitored by the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of regA protein. regA protein exhibited differential affinities for the polynucleotides examined, with the order of affinity being poly(rU) greater than poly(dT) greater than poly(dU) = poly(rG) greater than poly(rC) = poly(rA). The binding site size calculated for regA protein binding to poly(rU) was n = 9 +/- 1 nucleotides. Cooperativity was observed in binding to multiple-site oligonucleotides, with a cooperativity parameter (omega) value of 10-22. To study the specific interaction between regA protein and T4 gene 44 mRNA, the affinity of regA protein for synthetic gene 44 RNA fragments was measured. The association constant (Ka) for regA protein binding to gene 44 RNA fragments was 100-fold higher than for binding to nontarget RNA. Study of variant gene 44 RNA fragments indicated that the nucleotides required for specific binding are contained within a 12-nucleotide sequence spanning -12 to -1, relative to the AUG codon. The bases of five nucleotides (indicated in upper case type) are critical for specific regA protein interaction with the gene 44 recognition element, 5'-aaUGAGgAaauu-3'. These studies further showed that formation of a regA protein-RNA complex involves a maximum of 2-3 ionic interactions and is primarily an enthalpy-driven process."
https://openalex.org/W2113959082,"Abstract Vaccinia virus growth factor (VGF), a highly glycosylated 77-residue epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like polypeptide encoded in vaccinia poxvirus, is reported to play an important role in stimulating growth of uninfected cells to facilitate virus infection. We have chemically synthesized the unglycosylated forms of VGF and VGF19-69, a shortened VGF analog consisting of 51 residues and comprising the EGF-homologous region (position 19-69) of VGF. Both synthetic forms of VGFs were purified to homogeneity and vigorously characterized by various criteria, including the Cf-252 ion fission fragment mass spectrometry, amino acid sequencing, and enzymatic digestion to confirm the disulfide linkages. Synthetic VGFs exhibited high affinity binding to the EGF receptors in A431, NRK 49F, NRK clone 3, and NIH 3T3 cells, but, unlike the glycosylated form, showed contrasting mitogenic activities in various cells in vitro. Synthetic VGFs showed low levels of mitogenic and colonogenic activities in NRK clone 49F cells and NIH 3T3 cells, full agonist activities in human keratinocytes and Swiss 3T3 cells, and partial agonist activities in NRK clone 3 cells. Our results suggest that the unglycosylated form of VGF is an EGF antagonist to selected cells and that the production of unglycosylated form of VGF by the cytolytic vaccinia virus may serve as a mechanism whereby inhibition of growth and metabolism of selected host cells may be used to facilitate the propagation of the virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W1594962018,"We have investigated in vitro transcriptional initiation by purified yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase using a variety of previously described promoter variants and dinucleotides corresponding to the first two transcript nucleotides. Regardless of the actual nucleotides that occupy the first two transcript positions, the rate of initiation increases with increasing concentrations of the first two ribonucleoside triphosphates up to 125 microM whereas elongation is carried out optimally with less than 10 microM. Under normal in vitro transcription conditions, mitochondrial RNA polymerase only employs the in vitro start site (+1 position), again without regard to the nucleotide at the position. Even with initiator dinucleotide monophosphates as primers, the polymerase is only capable of initiating transcription at this position and one other, i.e. 1 base upstream (-1). Dinucleotides enhance transcription from partially active variant promoters (mutations around the initiation sites -3, -1, +1, +2), suggesting that these mutations reduce transcription by their effects on initiation. In contrast, inactive promoters (-7C, -6G, -4A, and -2A) are not active in the presence of initiating dinucleotide. We suggest that dinucleotides may function in one of three ways: (i) bypassing the energy barrier in forming the first internucleotide bond; (ii) stabilizing the initiation complex; or (iii) accelerating promoter clearance."
https://openalex.org/W1518531684,"The expression of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein products was studied in cells transfected with env gene constructs transcribed from an SV40 promoter. Gene constructs possessing the complete tat, rev (tat+ rev+) and env genes were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells as precursor SU-TM (gp160), SU.TM (gp120 x 41), and nucleolar rev protein. In addition, envelope glycoprotein was detected on the surface of those transfected COS-1 cells expressing abundant levels of env protein. Transfected constructs possessing a mutated tat translational initiation codon (tat-rev+) were expressed in COS-1 cells with at least a 10-fold increase in the level of envelope glycoprotein expression compared to the analogous constructs with an intact tat AUG codon (tat+ rev+). Mutation of the rev initiation codon (tat+ rev-) and (tat-rev-) resulted in no detectable expression of env products but expression of these proteins could be rescued by co-transfection of a cDNA encoding the rev gene. Subgenomic tat/rev transcripts were detected following transfection of all of the gene constructs indicating splicing of the env mRNAs transcribed from a heterologous promoter. Unspliced env transcripts were only detected in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with (rev+) constructs or with the (tat- rev-) construct in the presence of the rev cDNA supplied in trans. In contrast, unspliced transcripts were detected in the nuclear and total cellular RNA of all transfected cells. Expression of rev protein was localized to the nucleolus of transfected COS-1 cells. These results indicate that the export of unspliced env mRNA to the cytoplasm is facilitated by the expression of rev. Following env synthesis, the conversion of SU-TM (gp160) to SU.TM (gp120 x 41) was not quantitative. After a 20-h pulse-chase, only 40% of the SU-TM (gp160) present at the start of the chase period was subsequently accountable as mature SU (gp120), and approximately 30% of the detectable SU (gp120) was found in the culture medium of transfected COS-1 cells. The findings indicate that the surface expression of SU.TM (gp120 x 41) derived from heterologous gene transcripts is modulated (i) the co-expression of rev, (ii) the efficiency of proteolytic processing of SU-TM (gp160), and (iii) the degree of SU (gp120) shedding and/or secretion from the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1657441673,"The flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase from Escherichia coli contains an oxidation-reduction active disulfide made up of Cys135 and Cys138. Mutations changing each Cys residue to a Ser residue have been effected (Prongay, A. J., engelke, D. R., and Williams, C. H., Jr. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2656-2664). The FAD prosthetic group of each altered thioredoxin reductase has been replaced with 1-deaza-FAD (a flavin analog with carbon substituted for nitrogen at position 1), 4-thio-FAD (a flavin analog with sulfur substituted for oxygen at position 4), and 6-thiocyanato-FAD. 1-Deaza-FAD-TRR(Cys135,Ser138) has absorbance and fluorescence spectral properties similar to the oxidized form of wild type apothioredoxin reductase reconstituted with 1-deaza-FAD. The absorbance spectrum of 1-deaza-FAD-TRR(Ser135,Cys138) is similar to the spectrum of the two-electron reduced form of wild type apothioredoxin reductase reconstituted with 1-deaza-FAD, indicating that it is a mixture of two species (O'Donnell, M. E., and Williams, C. H., Jr. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2243-2251). The spectrum of one of these species of 1-deaza-FAD-TRR(Ser135,Cys138) resembles the spectrum of oxidized 1-deaza-FAD bound to wild type apothioredoxin reductase. The other species has an absorbance spectrum with a single peak at 400 nm (epsilon 400 = 11,100 M-1 cm-1) and resembles the spectrum of a thiolate adduct at the C4a position of the 1-deaza-FAD. The equilibrium between these species is pH-dependent, with a maximum of 50% C4a-adduct formation at low pH, and is linked to pK alpha values at 8.2 and 9.3. The absorbance spectrum of 4-thio-FAD-TRR(Cys135,Ser138) resembles the spectrum of the unbound 4-thio-FAD, whereas 4-thio-FAD-TRR(Ser135,Cys138) has a spectrum indicative of a mixture of 4-thio-FAD and FAD, suggesting a reaction between the 4-position of the flavin and Cys138. The binding of 6-thiocyanato-FAD to the apoprotein of the mutated enzymes showed no evidence for a reaction between the thiols and the group at the 6-position of the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1505920845,"The ability of the human ubiquitin carboxyl extension protein (HUBCEP80) to functionally replace its yeast homolog was determined in a ubi3 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of HUBCEP80 in ubi3 mutants resulted in processing of the fusion protein to produce free ubiquitin and extension protein, the latter of which localized specifically with the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Furthermore, expression of the human fusion protein completely alleviated the phenotypic deficiencies found in ubi3 mutants, including slow growth, abnormal ribosomal RNA processing, and correspondingly low levels of 40 S ribosomal subunits. Finally, expression of the extension protein alone was much less efficient in complementing the ubi3 mutant phenotype as compared with expression of the normal ubiquitin-fused extension protein. In the latter case, cells were found to contain at least 5-fold more extension protein, suggesting that ubiquitin either increased translational efficiency of the HUBCEP80 transcript or increased the stability of the processed extension protein."
https://openalex.org/W1564989579,"Abstract FRTL-5 cells possess high affinity low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which bind, internalize, and degrade LDL. When FRTL-5 cells are deprived of thyrotropin (TSH) the binding of LDL increases more than 2-fold. Upon addition of TSH, at a concentration of 1 x 10(-10) M or greater, LDL binding decreases rapidly and within 24 h reaches the level which is typical of FRTL-5 cells chronically stimulated by TSH. The data available suggest that TSH-dependent down-regulation of LDL receptor activity is exerted through a reduction of the number of active LDL receptors, with no change in affinity. It is unlikely that the synthesis of LDL receptors is impaired, since LDL receptor messenger RNA is not decreased by TSH. The effect of the hormone on LDL receptor activity can be mimicked by 8-Br-cAMP and is completely abolished by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide but not by actinomycin D. TSH regulation of LDL receptor activity is lost in v-ras Ki-transformed FRTL-5 cells (Ki Mol) which also have lost TSH dependence for adenylate cyclase activation and growth. However, 8-Br-cAMP decreases LDL binding in Ki Mol FRTL-5 cells. The reduced availability of LDL receptor in TSH-stimulated FRTL-5 cells may be related to the increased membrane fluidity (Beguinot, F., Beguinot, L., Tramontano, D., Duilio, C., Formisano, S., Bifulco, M., Ambesi-Impiombato, F. S., and Aloj, S. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1575-1582) or may reflect increased degradation of LDL receptors. We propose that a lower cholesterol uptake is needed in an actively proliferating cell population, to increase the production of isoprenoids whether it be for cholesterol biosynthesis or for the synthesis of other compounds requiring isoprenoid precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1603388614,"Treatment of primary cultured adipocytes with 20 mM glucose resulted in a progressive increase in specific 125I-insulin binding that began almost immediately (no lag period) and culminated in a 60% increase by 24 h. This effect was dose-dependent (glucose ED50 of 4.6 mM) and mediated by an increase in insulin receptor affinity. Moreover, it appears that glucose modulates insulin receptor affinity through de novo protein synthesis rather than through covalent modification of receptors, since cycloheximide selectively inhibited the glucose-induced increase in insulin binding capacity (ED50 of 360 ng/ml) and restored receptor affinity to control values. Importantly, insulin sensitivity of the glucose transport system was increased by glucose treatment (63%) to an extent comparable with the enhancement in receptor affinity, thus indicating a functional coupling between insulin binding and insulin action. When the long term effects of insulin were assessed (24 h), we found that insulin treatment reduced 125I-insulin binding by greater than 60% by down-regulating the number of cell surface receptors in a dose-dependent manner (insulin ED50 of 7.4 ng/ml). On the basis of these studies, we conclude that 1) insulin binding is subject to dual regulation (glucose controls insulin action by enhancing receptor affinity, whereas insulin controls the number of cell surface receptors); and 2) glucose appears to modulate insulin receptor affinity through the rapid biosynthesis of an affinity regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1596453910,"We examined the flash photolysis of oxy complexes of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) on the nanosecond time scale at ambient temperatures. In this time range, we can observe the geminate reaction of Mb with the O2 ligand existing in the protein matrix after the photodissociation from the heme iron. We found that the fraction of the geminate component to the total O2 photodissociation exhibited temperature dependences. The geminate fraction decreased with rising temperature, indicating that the protein fluctuation is enhanced at high temperature because of thermal agitation. However, the temperature-dependent behavior showed a break at 20 degrees C. Concerning the geminate O2 escaping reaction from the protein matrix to the solvent region, the activation energy above 20 degrees C (0.4 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol) is significantly lower than that below 20 degrees C (5.1 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol). Thermodynamic analysis on the basis of the transition state theory indicated that the O2 escaping reaction above 20 degrees C is entropy dominated whereas that below 20 degrees C is enthalpy dominated. The results were qualitatively compatible with the theoretical prediction by J. Kottalam and D. A. Case [1988) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 7690-7697). Comparing the kinetic and thermodynamic process of the O2 geminate reaction among several Mbs, we concluded that the geminate O2 reaction with Mb is governed by the dynamic motion of the protein which is sensitively controlled by the static interaction of the heme moiety with the surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W76520175,"Protein synthesis in sea urchin eggs is stimulated dramatically upon fertilization. We previously demonstrated that this stimulation is primarily due to an increase in the rate of polypeptide chain initiation which in turn may be regulated at the level of recycling of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) (Colin, A. M., Brown, B. D., Dholakia, J. N., Woodley, C. L., Wahba, A. J., and Hille, M. B. (1987) Dev. Biol. 123, 354-363). We have now purified eIF-2 from sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus blastulae to apparent homogeneity by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, Mono Q, Mono P, and Mono S columns. The factor, which differs from mammalian eIF-2, is composed of three non-identical subunits with apparent molecular weights of 40,000-alpha; 47,000-beta, and 58,000-gamma as estimated by sodium dodecyl-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antibodies raised against rabbit reticulocyte eIF-2 do not cross-react with sea urchin eIF-2. The binding of Met-tRNA(f) to sea urchin eIF-2 is totally dependent on GTP. A 4-fold stimulation in the rate of protein synthesis in unfertilized sea urchin egg extracts is observed by the addition of 1 micrograms of purified eIF-2. The factor also binds GDP to form a binary (eIF-2.GDP) complex which is stable in the presence of Mg2+. GDP binding to sea urchin eIF-2 inhibits ternary (eIF-2-GTP.[35S]Met-tRNA(f) complex formation. The rabbit reticulocyte guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalyzes the exchange of GDP bound to sea urchin eIF-2 for GTP and stimulates ternary complex formation. The requirement of GEF for the recycling of eIF-2 suggests that protein synthesis in sea urchins is similar to that in mammalian systems and may also be regulated at the level of GEF activity. The reticulocyte heme-controlled repressor phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of eIF-2 from both sea urchins and rabbit reticulocytes. However, casein kinase II which phosphorylates the beta-subunit of the reticulocyte factor specifically phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of sea urchin eIF-2. In this respect, the sea urchin factor is similar to eIF-2 isolated from other nonmammalian sources. Since both heme controlled repressor and casein kinase II phosphorylate the alpha-subunit of sea urchin eIF-2 caution should be exercised when interpreting the significance of eIF-2(alpha) phosphorylation in sea urchins."
