https://openalex.org/W2051962533,Selective growth of T lymphocytes occurred when unfractionated normal human bone marrow cells were cultured with conditioned medium obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes (Ly-CM). Cultures of up to 90 percent T cells have been maintained for more than 9 months. The T cells exhibited a strict growth dependence upon Ly-CM and were consistently negative for Epstein-Barr viral information.
https://openalex.org/W1599390139,"Results of studies of the Ca2+-dependent protein modulator of 3':5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase isolated from bovine brain are presented which show its structural similarity to the Ca2+-binding subunit of muscle troponin. Both proteins have blocked NH2 termini, similar and characteristic ultraviolet absorption spectra, similar Ca2+-binding properties, very similar amino acid compositions, and co-migrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The primary structures of selected tryptic peptides isolated from bovine brain modulator protein are similar or identical with regions of the primary sequences of rabbit skeletal muscle and bovine cardiac muscle troponin C. Bovine brain modulator protein contains and unidentified ninhydrin-positive basic compound not found in muscle troponin C. An improved procedure is presented which yields 40 to 70 mg of modulator protein per kg of bovine brain."
https://openalex.org/W2165232178,"When passaged at high multiplicity, four strains of Sendai virus all showed evidence that they contained defective interfering (DI) particles. RNA isolated from nucleocapsids of cells infected with the high multiplicity passage stocks was found to consist of only minor amounts of nondefective genome length RNA and major amounts of smaller RNAs, the DI-RNAs. These DI-RNAs were found to have unusual and variable sedimentation properties in sucrose gradients, but were found to represent unique segments of the viral genome by length measurements in the electron microscope and by hybridization. A striking feature of the DI-RNAs is their ability to form circular structures, indicating that the ends of the DI-RNA are complementary. The implications of this finding in terms of the mechanism of genome replication is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1984724155,"We have synthesized a convenient electron microscope label for mapping poly(A) sequences. Short lengths of poly(dT) are polymerized onto nicked circular SV40 DNA with the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. An RNA or DNA molecule of interest is treated with glyoxal, hybridized briefly with the poly(dT) circles, and spread for microscopy; poly(A) stretches are clearly marked because they are attached to the poly(dT) on the easily recognized SV40 duplex circles. The RNAs of several type C oncornaviruses were examined by this method. The endogenous feline virus (RD-114), the endogenous baboon virus (BKD), and the woolly monkey sarcoma virus (WoMV) all contain a dimer of RNA subunits held together in a central secondary structure feature we call the dimer linkage structure. Both ends distal to the dimer linkage structure hybridize to the SV40-poly(dT). Assuming both poly(A)s are on the 3′ ends of the subunits and that both subunits are identical, the two identical subunits are held together by interactions between sequences close to the 5′ ends."
https://openalex.org/W2082422179,"Although ovalbumin and conalbumin mRNA accumulate in the same tubular gland cells of the chick oviduct in response to estrogen or progesterone treatment, the kinetics of induction are markedly different. Conalbumin mRNA begins to accumulate within 30 min after estrogen administration, whereas there is a lag of approximately 3 hr before ovalbumin mRNA begins to accumulate, as measured by three independent assays. The kinetics of estrogen-receptor binding to chromatin indicate that these sites are saturated within 15 min of estrogen administration to the chicks, demonstrating that the lag is not due to slow uptake of the steroid. Suboptimal doses of estrogen produce the same lag, but the resultant rate of ovalbumin mRNA accumulation is lower than with an optimal dose. Partial induction of ovalbumin mRNA by a low dose of estrogen does not shorten the lag with an optimal dose. With progesteone, there is a lag of about 2 hr before either ovalbumin or conalbumin mRNA begins to accumulate. Treatment of chicks with hydroxyurea shortens the lag for ovalbumin induction with either hormone. Inhibition of protein synthesis with emetine does not prevent the accumulation of either ovalbumin or conalbumin mRNA. With cycloheximide, however, ovalbumin mRNA accumulation can be prevented. The existence of a lag suggests that there are intermediate steps between the binding of steroid receptors to chromatin and the induction of ovalbumin mRNA. There are basically two models to explain these delays in response: one involving the accumulation of an essential intermediate, and the other involving a rate-limiting translocation of steroid receptors from initial nonproductive chromatin-binding sites to productive sites. Several aspects of the kinetics of ovalbumin mRNA induction are more consistent with the latter model."
https://openalex.org/W1909104035,"We have proposed that glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) is a two-component system consisting of (a) a glucose-6-P-specific transporter which mediates the movement of the hexose phosphate from the cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (or cisternae of the isolated microsomal vesicle), and (b) a nonspecific phosphohydrolase-phosphotransferase localized on the luminal surface of the membrane (Arion, W.J., Wallin, B.K., Lange, A.J., and Ballas, L.M. (1975) Mol. Cell. Biochem. 6, 75-83). Additional support for this model has been obtained by studying the interactions of D-mannose-6-P and D-mannose with the enzyme of untreated (i.e. intact) and taurocholate-disrupted microsomes. An exact correspondence was shown between the mannose-6-P phosphohydrolase activity at low substrate concentrations and the permeability of the microsomal membrane to EDTA. The state of intactness of the membrane influenced the kinetics of mannose inhibition of glucose-6-P hydrolysis; uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibitions were observed for intact and disrupted microsomes, respectively. The apparent Km for glucose-6-P was smaller with intact preparations at mannose concentrations above 0.3 M. Mannose significantly inhibited total glucose-6-P utilization by intact microsomes, whereas D-glucose had a stimulatory effect. Both hexoses markedly enhanced the rate of glucose-6-P utilization by disrupted microsomes. The actions of mannose on the glucose-6-phosphatase of intact microsomes fully support the postulated transport model. They are predictable consequences of the synthesis and accumulation of mannose-6-P in the cisternae of microsomal vesicles which possess a nonspecific, multifunctional enzyme on the inner surface and a limiting membrane permeable to D-glucose, D-mannose, glucose-6-P, but impermeable to mannose-6-P. The latency of the mannose-6-P phosphohydrolase activity is proposed as a reliable, quantitative index of microsomal membrane integrity. The inherent limitations of the use of EDTA permeability for this purpose are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1500966449,"Secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), but not glucagon, stimulate accumulation of cyclic AMP in dispersed guinea pig pancreatic acinar cells. Secretin stimulated cellular accumulation of cyclic AMP by interacting with a single class of high affinity receptors. On the other hand, the dose-response curve for VIP-stimulated cellular cyclic AMP was biphasic and reflected interaction of this peptide with two classes of receptors. Results obtained with synthetic fragments of VIP and secretin indicate that the receptor having a high affinity for VIP has a low affinity for secretin, interacts with, but does not distinguish among, secretin, secretin 5-27 and [6-tyrosine] secretin or among secretin 14-27, VIP 14-28, VIP 15-28, and increases cellular cyclic AMP when occupied by VIP, but not when occupied by secretin, [6-tyrosine] secretin, or secretin 1-14. The receptor having a low affinity for VIP has a high affinity for secretin, interacts with and distinguishes among secretin, secretin 5-27, and [6-tyrosine] secretin, interacts with secretin 14-27 but not with VIP 14-28 or VIP 15-28, and increases cellular cyclic AMP when occupied by VIP, secretin, [6-tyrosine] secretin, or secretin 1-14."
https://openalex.org/W2024081722,"Fluorescence emission of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from the surface of perfused rat hearts was photographed to provide a two-dimensional recording of NADH levels. Sodium Amytal inhibition of NADH oxidation resulted in a homogeneous increase in NADH fluorescence, while lowering perfusion pressure from 55 to 10 torr caused a heterogeneous increase in NADH fluorescence, reflecting the heterogeneous oxygen delivery at this low pressure. Local ischemia resulted in a well-defined region of high NADH fluorescence that corresponded to the region of ischemic inslut. The sharp transition between the ischemic and normoxic areas demonstrated that the hypoxic interface separating the two areas must be quite small."
https://openalex.org/W1591100910,"Essentially pure phenylalanine hydroxylase from rat liver can be activated between 2.5- and 3.0-fold by treatment with Mg2+, ATP, protein kinase, and cyclic AMP. The activation is seen when the hydroxylase is assayed in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin, but not in the presence of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine. In the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, activation is accompanied by incorporation of 32P into the protein to the extent of 0.7 mol/mol of hydroxylase subunit (Mr = 50,000). Cehmical analysis of the untreated enzyme shows that it already contains about 0.3 mol of Pi/mol of hydroxylase. These results suggest that the activity of the hydroxylase may be regulated by phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1965084792,"The number of elongating form A and B RNA polymerases in chick oviduct nuclei was estimated by measuring incorporation of 3H-UTP into 3′ termini of nascent RNA chains in the presence of heparin to inhibit initiation, and quantitating labeled uridine released from these termini after alkaline hydrolysis. The method corrects for conversion of UMP to uridine (U) during manipulations and for production of 3′ termini by ribonucleases and phosphatases. The results indicate that a large fraction of RNA polymerases elongating in vivo is retained in isolated nuclei: per diploid genome, approximately 1 × 104 form B and 2 × 103 form A enzymes are present. These levels are sufficient to maintain normal in vivo rates of mRNA and rRNA synthesis, but the average density of packing of polymerases on DNA is considerably less than the maximum density predicted by Miller and Bakken, 1972 Miller O.L. Bakken A.H. Dicsfalusy E. Gene Transcription in Reproductive Tissue. Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm1972: 155-177 Google Scholar , suggesting that initiation of polymerases on DNA is a limiting factor in the control of transcription. Rates of elongation of polymerases in vitro are severely impaired, indicative of a loss of elongation factors during nuclear isolation. After 6 hr of estradiol treatment in vivo, the level of form A enzymes in oviduct nuclei increases to 5 × 103; little change in the number of form B enzymes is seen."
https://openalex.org/W1622653499,"The COOH-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-OP) and carbamylcholine each increased calcium outflux, cellular cyclic GMP and amylase secretion in dispersed guinea pig pancreatic acinar cells. Following addition of CCK-OP or carbamylcholine, cellular cyclic GMP increased as early as 15 s, became maximal after 1 to 2 min, and then decreased steadily during the subsequent incubation. For both CCK-OP and carbamylcholine there was close agreement between the dose-response curve for stimulation of calcium outflux and that for increase of cellular cyclic GMP. With CCK-OP an effect on both functions could be detected at 10(-10) M and maximal stimulation occurred at 3 X 10(-8) M. With carbamylcholine an effect on both functions could be detected at 10(-5) M and maximal stimulation occurred at 3 X 10(-3) M. Atropine inhibited stimulation of both cyclic GMP and calcium outflux by carbamylcholine but not by CCK-OP. Stimulation of calcium outflux or cellular cyclic GMP by CCK-OP or carbamylcholine did not require extracellular calcium since stimulation occurred in a calcium-free, ethylene glycol bis(beta, beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)-containing solution. The divalent cation ionophore A-23187 increased bidirectional fluxes of calcium, cellular cyclic GMP and secretion of amylase from dispersed pancreatic acinar cells. Like CCK-OP and carbamylcholine, the ionophore stimulated calcium outflux and cellular cyclic GMP in a calcium-free, EGTA-containing solution. These results suggest that in pancreatic acinar cells the initial step in the sequence of events mediating the action of ionophore as well as that of CCK-OP and carbamylcholine is stimulation of calcium outflux, and that this stimulation then increases cellular cyclic GMP."
https://openalex.org/W1555801234,"In previous studies we have shown that the activation of bovine heart cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase by purified protein activator is completely dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and that the protein activator Ca2+ complex is probably the true activator for the enzyme (Teo, T.S. and Wang, J.H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5930-5955). More recent studies have led us to believe that the mechanism of the Ca2+ activation of phosphodiesterase resembles that of the Ca2+ activation of muscle contraction and that the protein activator may play a role similar to troponin. In the present study we show that the protein activator resembles rabbit muscle troponin C in amino acid composition, molecular weight, isoelectric point, and ultraviolet absorption spectrum. Preliminary structural studies also indicate that these two proteins may have evolved from a common ancestral protein through gene duplication. This argument is strengthened by the finding that the tryptic peptide map of the bovine heart protein activator is indistinguishable from that of the bovine brain phosphodiesterase activator protein for which preliminary sequence information also suggests homology to troponin C (Watterson, D.M., Harrelson, W.G., Jr., Keller, P.M., Sharief, F., and Vanaman, T.C.

https://openalex.org/W114064430,"Rat liver parenchymal cell binding, uptake, and proteolytic degradation of rat 125I-labeled high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfraction, HDL3 (1.10 less than d less than 1.210 g/ml), in which apo-A-I is the major polypeptide, were investigated. Structural and metabolic integrity of the isolated cells was verified by trypan blue exclusion, low lactic dehydrogenase leakage, expected morphology, and gluconeogenesis from lactate and pyruvate. 125I-labeled HDL3 was incubated with 10 X 10(6) cells at 37 degrees and 4 degrees in albumin and Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4. Binding and uptake were determined by radioactivity in washed cells. Proteolytic degradation was determined by trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the incubation medium. At 37 degrees, maximum HDL3 binding (Bmax) and uptake occurred at 30 min with a Bmax of 31 ng/mg dry weight of cells. The apparent dissociation constant of the HDL3 receptor system (Kd) was 60 X 10(-8) M, based on Mr = 28,000 of apo-A-I, the predominant rat HDL3 protein. Proteolytic degradation showed a 15-min lag and then constant proteolysis. After 2 hours 5.8% of incubated 125I-labeled HDL3 was degraded. Sixty per cent of cell radioactivity at 37 degrees was trypsin-releasable. At 37 degrees, 125I-labeled HDL3 was incubated with cells in the presence of varying concentrations of native (cold) HDL3, very low density lipoproteins, and low density lipoproteins. Incubation with native HDL3 resulted in greatest inhibition of 125I-labeled HDL3 binding, uptake, and proteolytic degradation. When 125I-labeled HDL3 was preincubated with increasing amounts of HDL3 antiserum, binding and uptake by cells were decreased to complete inhibition. Cell binding, uptake, and proteolytic degradation of 125I-labeled HDL3 were markedly diminished at 4 degrees. Less than 1 mM chloroquine enhanced 125I-labeled HDL3 proteolysis but at 5 mM or greater, chloroquine inhibited proteolysis with 125I-labeled HDL3 accumulation in cells. L-[U-14C]Lysine-labeled HDL3 was bound, taken up, and degraded by cells as effectively as 125I-labeled HDL3. These data suggest that liver cell binding, uptake, and proteolytic degradation of rat HDL3 are actively performed and linked in the sequence:binding, then uptake, and finally proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, there may be a specific HDL3 (lipoprotein A) receptor of recognition site(s) on the plasma membrane. Finally, our data further support our previous reports of the important role of liver lysosomes in proteolytic degradation of HDL3."

https://openalex.org/W1594388332,"The larval hemolymph of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, contains a carrier protein that binds specifically and with high affinity the juvenile hormone, an important regulator of insect development. This protein serves to transport the hormone and to protect it from the action of degradative enzymes during early larval stages. Using hemolymph from the last larval stage, we have isolated a pure carrier protein using acetone precipitation, gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and preparative isoelectric focusing. Gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, and equilibrium ultracentrifugation established that the carrier protein is a single chain polypeptide of approximately 28,000 daltons. The amino acid composition is unexceptional, and no evidence for hexosamine has been obtained. An ion exchange filter disc assay method was used to determine the formation of the complex between the carrier protein and isotopically labeled juvenile hormone. With this technique it was shown that each carrier protein binds one hormone molecule with a dissociation constant of 4.4 +/- 0.2 X 10(-7) M at 0 degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1491812285,"Adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) phosphodiesterase activity of normal human peripheral blood leukocyte suspensions containing 90% lymphocytes and 10% monocytes showed anomalous kinetic behavior indicative of multiple enzyme forms. Kinetic analyses of purified lymphocyte (99%) or monocyte preparations (95%) indicated that only one type of phosphodiesterase was present in each cell type. None of the preparations contained any detectable guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) hydrolytic activity. The lymphocyte enzyme had an apparent Km congruent to 0.4 muM for cyclic AMP and Vmax congruent to 0.5 picomoles/min/10(6) cells. These kinetic parameters were confirmed by several cell purification techniques used alone and sequentially. Sedimentation velocity analyses indicated that the higher Km monocyte enzyme had a molecular weight near 45,000 and that the lower Km lymphocyte enzyme most likely had a molecular weight near 98,000. A variety of procedures led to a loss of the higher molecular weight, high affinity enzyme leaving only the enzyme of 45,000 daltons with a much lower substrate affinity. A long term, stable human lymphoblastoid cell line had cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity that was similar to the lymphocyte enzyme by both physical and kinetic criteria. Lymphocyte cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase appears to be a soluble enzyme whose pH and temperature optima and cationic requirements are similar to those of other mammalian phosphodiesterases. The distinct cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase forms of these cells may possibly represent the basic, active subunit of mammalian cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. We hypothesize that the extremely high affinity cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase of normal lymphocytes plays an important role in the regulation of normal function in these cells, and also in the rapid proliferative responses characteristic of the stimulated lymphocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2018348630,"The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) was used as an assay system to investigate the the invasive properties of viral transformed NIH/3Y3 cells. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that single Kirsten sarcoma virus (KiSV)-transformed cells passed between the epithelial cells of the CAM ectoderm within 6 hr of application, while viable NIH/3T3 cells did not penetrate the ectoderm within 24 hr. The transformed cells entered the mesoderm of the CAM and formed tumors of proliferating cells. The application of 5 X 10(5) KiSV-transformed cells resulted in the formation of donor cells resulted in the formation of the donor cell tumors within 5 days in 43% of the membranes. No tumors were formed when as many as 5 X 10(6) NIH/3T3 cells were applied to the membrane. NIH/3T3 cells transformed by the Abelson leukemia virus or the Moloney sarcoma virus also ivaded the CAM and formed tumors of proliferating cells within the mesoderm, while cells infected with the Moloney leukemia virus did not.

https://openalex.org/W1533986732,"Steroid-receptor complexes formed at low temperature and ionic strength do not bind to nuclei or chromatin. After a temporary exposure to high temperature, or ionic strength, or both, a fraction of them becomes activated (able to bind to nuclei). An assay of the activated form of the complex based upon titration with nuclei in excess was established. This assay was used to perform kinetic and equilibrium studies of the thermal activation of glucocorticoid-receptor complex in order to elucidate its mechanism. It was found that the reaction is of apparent first order and yields a monomolecular product. It thus probably consists of a conformational change in the steroid-receptor complex. The rate of activation is 1.37 +/- 0.06 X 10(-3) S-1 at 25 degrees. The free energy of thermodynamic activation (The word activation is used here in its usual thermodynamic meaning and not in the sense of receptor modification) of this reaction is greater than G = 21.3 Kcal. The corresponding enthalpy and entropy are respectively greater than H = 31.4 kcal and greater than S = 4 cal/degree. These positive and high values of greater than H and greater than S are very similar to those described for denaturation reactions of proteins suggesting that breakage of some noncovalent bonds could take place during activation. The reaction proceeds until approximately 60% of the complexes are activated. It was shown that this corresponds to an equilibrium between activated and nonactivated forms and not to the presence of a population of complexes unable to undergo activation. This equilibrium is not modified by temperature variations between 10 degrees and 30 degrees. It is possible to activate over 80% of the complexes when the activation is performed in the presence of excess acceptor, thus shifting the equilibrium. A similar situation is probably observed in situ in cells since 90% of the complexes are found in the nuclei when liver slices are incubated with hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1578967012,"5-Iodo-5'-amino-2',5'-dideoxyuridine (AIdUrd) is a novel thymidine analog which inhibits herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HS-1 virus) replication in the absence of detectable host toxicity. When murine, simian, or human cells in culture are treated with [125I]AIdUrd for up to 24 hours essentially none of the nucleoside becomes cell-associated. In contrast, upon HS-1 virus infection significant radiolabel is detected in both nucleotide pools and in DNA. The major acid-soluble metabolite has been shown by enzymic and chromatographic analysis to be the 5'-triphosphate of AIdUrd. DNA from HS-1 virus-infected Vero cells labeled with [14C]thymidine, 5-[125I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdUrd), or [125I]AIdUrd was isolated by buoyant density centrifugation and subjected to digestion by pancreatic DNase I, spleen DNase II, micrococcal nuclease, spleen, and venom phosphodiesterases. Analysis of the digestion products clearly indicate that AIdUrd is incorporated internally into the DNA structure. DNA containing AIdUrd therefore contains phosphoramidate (P-N) bonds, known to be extremely acid-labile. The selective HS-1 virus-induced phosphorylation of AIdUrd and its subsequent incorporation into DNA may account for the unique biological activity of the AIdUrd nucleoside."

Among type C viral structural polypeptides, p10 has been least well characterized immunologically. The results of the present study indicate that p10 is virus-coded and possesses strong group-specific antigenic determinants. By use of appropriate immunoassays, broadly reactive interspecies determinants shared by mammalian type C virus isolates of murine, feline, and primate origin, were also demonstrated.

In addition, partially purified RNA polymerase I could be phosphorylated in vitro by an endogenous protein kinase. Phosphorylation by either method was followed by extensive purification of the enzyme. This revealed that 32P remained bound to the enzyme throughout purification. Analysis of the homogeneous labeled protein by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions followed by autoradiography revealed that only one of the two forms of RNA polymerase I in rat liver nuclei was phosphorylated. RNA polymerase II was not phosphorylated in intact nuclei. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the phosphorylated RNA polymerase I in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate followed by autoradiography demonstrated that the 32P was located primarily on enzyme subunits SA1, SA3, and SA5-SA6. High voltage paper electrophoresis of a partial acid hydrolysate of phosphorylated RNA polymerase I revealed that both serine and threonine residues were phosphroylated. N6,O2'-Dibutyryl cyclic 3':5'-AMP stimulated endogenous RNA polymerase I activity and endogenous nuclear protein phosphorylation in intact nuclei. These results suggest that phosphorylation of RNA polymerase I by nuclear protein kinases may play a role in the control of transcription in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1606571684,"Studies have been conducted to characterize further the interaction between 125I-labeled bovine thyrotropin (TSH) and bovine thyroid plasma membranes. Sequential subcellular fractionation of thyroid homogenates yielded preparations of progressively greater specific binding activity, highest activity being found in fractions previously shown to contain predominately plasma membranes (Amir, S. M., Carraway, T.F., Kohn, L.D., and Winand, R.J. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4092-4100). Although binding of 125I-TSH by plasma membranes was greatest at pH 6.0, studies were conducted at pH 7.45 as well as pH 6.0, and results obtained differed quantitatively, but not qualitatively. Binding was maximal at 0 degrees, 15 degrees, and 22 degrees and steady state values remained unchanged for at least 22 hours. At 37 degrees, binding was decreased by 40% at 1 hour; the loss was even greater (65%) at 50 degrees. A similar loss of binding was evident when membranes were preincubated without TSH at 37 degrees or higher and were then incubated with 125I-TSH at 0 degrees. Lineweaver-Burk analysis indicated that preincubation resulted in loss of receptor sites without change in affinity of residual receptors. Addition of Ca2+ (1 to 10 mM) to the preincubation medium prevented the effect of preincubation at 37 degrees by preserving the number of receptor sites without altering their affinity. Under similar conditions, Na+ and K+ were without protective effect. Membranes bound 45Ca2+ in a specific and saturable manner. Scatchard plots indicated a dissociatiion constant (Kd) of 9 X 10(-5) M and a capacity (n) of 54 nmol/mg of membrane protein. 45Ca2+ was also displaced from membranes by Mg2+ and Mn2+. Ca2+ had a biphasic effect on binding; low concentrations (1 to 10 muM) added to the incubation mixture stimulated binding, while higher concentrations (0.1 mM) caused inhibition. Mg2+ and Mn2+, at comparable concentrations, were also inhibitory, Na+ and K+ less so. In the case of Ca2+, both the stimulatory and inhibitory concentrations were lower than those required to achieve saturation of Ca2+-binding sites. Proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and pronase) sharply reduced binding of 125I-TSH, owing to a decrease in receptor sites. Phospholipases A and C enhanced binding of TSH, while neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase were without measurable effect."
https://openalex.org/W1488337588,"We have studied chick oviduct progesterone receptor subunits and their effect on RNA transcription in oviduct chromatin. Initiation of RNA chain synthesis was measured by the rifampicin-challenge assay. Progesterone receptor subunits A and B were purified 200-fold by sequential chromatography on phosphocellulose, DEAE-cellulose, and hydroxylapatite. The subunits could be recombined to form the 6S receptor A-B dimer initially present in chick oviduct homogenates. The intact 6 S receptor dimer preparation increased transcription of oviduct chromatin by 40 to 60%. This increase corresponds to the creation of 5,800 new initiation sites per haploid cellular equivalent of DNA as chromatin. The increased chromatin transcription which resulted was half-maximal at a receptor concentration of about 5 x 10(-9) M. Preparations from other tissues which were devoid of progesterone-binding activity or oviduct preparations lacking progesterone did not stimulate rifampicin-resistant RNA synthesis. The oviduct receptor fraction contained no detectable glucocorticoid, androgen, or estrogen receptors. When isolated B subunits alone were incubated with chromatin, no transcriptional increase was detectable. Isolated A subunits increased chromatin transcription, but only at concentration approximately 10-fold higher than required of intact dimer. These observations suggest that the 6 S receptor dimer is the functional species in chromatin transcription in vivo; two hormones are required per dimer, one on each subunit. Since subunit A binds DNA and has stimulatory activity , a dimer dissociation at acceptor sites is postulated, liberating A subunits which stimulate RNA chain initiation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1558399391,"A corticosteroid-binding protein was detected in the whey of human colostrum and milk which resembles serum corticosteroid-binding globulin in certain respects: the equilibrium association constants for cortisol and progesterone binding and the apparent molecular size, as determined by Sephadex G-200 chromatography, were similar, and cortisol andd progesterone competed strongly for binding to the same site in each instance. Dexamethasone-binding activity could not be detected. The concentration of corticosteroid-binding protein in the colostrum obtained before parturition is about 0.1 muM; the concentration declines rapidly after parturition to about 0.01 muM. A corticosteroid-binding protein was found, also, in the whey of mature rat milk at levels of about 0.3 muM. This protein resembles rat serum corticosteroid-binding globulin: the equilibrium association constants for cortisol, corticosterone, and progesterone binding, and the apparent molecular size, as determined by Sephadex G-200 chromatography, were similar; the elution behavior of the respective proteins on anion exchange chromatography with DEAE-Sephadex A-50 was similar, also. Identity of the corticosteroid-binding proteins in whey with corticosteroid-binding globulin in serum is not presumed, however. Rat and human whey exhibited very little testosterone- or 17 beta-estradiol-binding activity. It is suggested the corticosteroid-binding proteins may play a significant physiological role in regulating the concentration of the bound and unbound forms of progesterone and cortisol in the fluids bathing the epithelial cells lining the mammary ducts and acini."
https://openalex.org/W2009947370,"Improvements in the technique of ultramicroinjection of macromolecules into animal cells are described. The method is based on the Sendai virus-induced fusion of animal cells with erythrocyte ghosts containing trapped macromolecules. Fusion of hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells with ghosts prepared by hemolysis of erythrocytes in the presence of cytochrome C is much more efficient than fusion with ghosts prepared in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as in previous investigations. La+++ is more fficient in promoting fusion and less toxic to cells than Mn++, which was used previously. Thus in all subsequent experiments, erythrocytes were hemolyzed in the presence of cytochrome C plus other macromolecules to be trapped, and the resultant ghosts fused in the presence of La+++. The percentage of HTC cells which fused with ghosts reached 80% in many experiments. Ghosts containing 125I-BSA were used to measure the number of BSA molecules injected into HTC cells. About 10(6) BSA molecules were injected per fused cell. The overall efficiency of injection was low (about 0.02% of the starting material)."
https://openalex.org/W2061896990,"Using the mouse L-cell line as a model system, a generalized approach is presented for nuclear transplantation in cultured cells resulting in the construction of cytoplasmic-nuclear hybrid cells. Techniques were developed for the preparation of cytoplast and karyoplasts having minimum contamination by parent whole cells. Sendai virusmediated fusion was performed in a manner which maximized the formation of the desired fusion products-cells having one cell equivalent of cytoplasm from one parent and a nucleus from a second parent. The viability of the fusion products was established by examination of photographic records of the developing cultures. Using these techniques, we found that nuclei could be introduced routinely into 10-30% of a cytoplast culture. From determinations of the increase in cell number with time, it was estimated that at least 30% of the reconstructed cells were capable of division. The approach was next applied to the formation of hybrid cells from L-cell cytoplasts and A9 cell karyoplasts. The A9 cell line is an azaguanine-resistant derivative of L cells. Thus any whole cells remaining in the culture of fused cells were readily eliminated by treatment with the purine analogue. The culture of remaining cytoplasmic-nuclear hybrid cells grew to confluence in the presence of azaguanine. The applicability of the approach to the construction of hybrid cells using parent lines from different organisms is briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1528895376,"Goat antibody against pure rabbit pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme was used to probe homology of converting enzymes from other species. Immunologically cross-reactive material was found in detergent-solubilized extracts of lung particles from rat, guinea pig, and dog by double immunodiffusion, radioimmunoassay, and inhibition of enzyme activity. No homology was demonstrable with bovine, frog, or chicken lung extracts. Antibodies from different individual goats yielded comparable estimates of homology by immunodiffusion and radioimmunoassay. In contrast, they varied greatly in extent and specificity of their inhibitory action on heterologous enzyme activity. The vasopressor effect of angiotensin I and the vasodepressor effect of bradykinin were diminished and potentiated, respectively, in rats treated with anti-rabbit enzyme antibody. A smaller but significant immune-dependent inhibition of the vasopressor response to angiotensin II was also observed."
https://openalex.org/W1533150429,"A fraction greatly enriched in microsomes was prepared from chick embryo limb bone tissue homogenates by differential centrifugation in a high density solution of Metrizamide. This fraction was used to determine the submicrosomal localization of prolyl hydroxylase. At a low concentration (0.05%) of the non-ionic detergents Triton X-100 and Brij-35, 90 to 93% of prolyl hydroxylase activity was released from microsomes. Concentrations of Triton X-100 greater than 0.1% were required to solubilize the intrinsic membrane enzyme NADH-ferricyanide reductase and to release membrane-bound ribosomes, while Brij-35 did not extensively solubilize membrane components even at concentrations up to 0.4%. In addition, prolyl hydroxylase activity which could subsequently be released from microsomes by Brij-35 was relatively resistant to trypsin proteolysis at concentrations which removed more than 50% of the ribosomes and approximately 40% of the protein from microsomes. These results suggest that 90 to 93% of prolyl hydroxylase activity in connective tissue is located within the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. Gel filtration of prolyl hydroxylase released from microsomes or found in the soluble fraction of limb bone homogenates revealed two peaks of activity corresponding to molecular weights of 230,000 and 450,000 to 500,000. The latter is twice the value reported for purified chick embryo prolyl hydroxylase. A fraction of the total prolyl hydroxylase activity (generally 20 to 35%) in microsome preparations could be measured in the absence of detergent, although the microsomal membrane should be impermeable to the large unhydroxylated collagen chains used as substrate. On the basis of experimental data, it was concluded that detergent-independent activity was most likely due to damaged microsomal membranes and that this damage was sufficient to allow substrate and trypsin to enter the cisternae but not to allow prolyl hydroxylase to be released."
https://openalex.org/W2030340210,"Clonal derivatives of C3HMT murine mammary cell lines in culture demonstrate conversion of mammary tumor virus (MMTV) expression at a rate of appriximately 6 per 100 clones. This alteration is largely unidirectional from a relatively high level (MMTV(H)) to a 10 fold lower level (MMTV(L)). This high rate of MMTV(L) variant conversion is in apparent contrast to the presumably mutational rate (approximately 3 per million cells) that governs development of resistance to 6-thioguanine (TG) in the same mammary cells. In somatic cell hybrids between different MMTV TGr clones and mouse or hamster TK- cells, expression of constitutive levels of MMTV and responsiveness to dexamethasone induction is dominant. Thus MMTV expression is regulated by at least two levels of positive control, constitutive expression and glucocorticoid stimulation, but the former is subject to a high rate of variant formation."
https://openalex.org/W1504276704,"Isolated rat kidneys were perfused with a recirculating medium containing exogenous adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) or guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) at an initial concentration of 0.1 mM. Both cyclic nucleotides were rapidly removed from the perfusate. Urinary excretion accounted for about 20% and 40% of the respective cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP lost from the perfusate. The metabolism of the cyclic nucleotides was studied by 14C-labeled cyclic nucleotides in the perfusate. During 60 min, 30% of added cyclic [14C]AMP was metabolized to renal [14C]adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, and AMP) and 30% to perfusate [14C]uric acid. Similarly, 20% of cyclic[14C]GMP was metabolized to renal [14C]guanine nucleotides (GTP, GDP, and GMP) and 30% to perfusate [14C]uric acid. Urine contained principally unchanged 14C-labeled cyclic nucleotide. Addition of 0.1 mM cyclic AMP to the perfusate elevated the renal ATP and ADP contents 2-fold. Addition of 0.1 mM of either cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP to the perfusate also elevated the renal production of uric acid 2- to 3-fold. The production and distribution of metabolites of exogenous cyclic nucleotides were also studied in the intact rat. Within 60 min after injection, 3.3 mumol of either 14C-labeled cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP was cleared from the plasma. Kidney cortex and liver were the principal tissues for 14C accumulation. Urinary excretion accounted for about 20 and 45% of the cyclic [14C]AMP and cyclic [14C]GMP lost from the plasma, respectively. The 14C found in the kidney and liver was present almost entirely as the respective purine mono-, di-, and trinucleotides. The other principal metabolite was [14C]allantoin, found in the urine and, to a lesser extent, the liver. The urine contained mostly unchanged 14C-labeled cyclic nucleotide. Unlike the findings with the perfused kidney, [14C]uric acid was not a significant metabolite of the 14C-labeled cyclic nucleotides in these in vivo experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1589568250,"The uptake of hypoxanthine by Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts grown in tissue culture was studied in wild type clones and 8-azaguanine-resistant mutant clones devoid of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Wild type fibroblasts rapidly accumulate [3H]hypoxanthine from the medium and over 80% of the intracellular radioactivity is found in acid-soluble nucleotides. The phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient clones accumulate much lower levels of hypoxanthine and over 85% of the intracellular 3H label is associated with chemically unaltered hypoxanthine. The internal level of hypoxanthine in the mutant clones rapidly approaches but does not exceed that present in the medium. Wild type and phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient cells take up hypoxanthine at almost identical initial rates at external hypoxanthine levels from 2 to 300 muM. Analysis of these data reveals two transport systems that obey the Michaelis-Menten relationship. These differ markedly in affinity, yielding average Km values of 20 and 600 muM for both cell types. Hypoxanthine transport by both low and high affinity transport systems is blocked by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate and N-ethylmaleimide. Counter-transport of hypoxanthine was demonstrated in phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient fibroblasts. It is concluded that hypoxanthine is transported into Chinese hamster cells by means of carrier-mediated processes (facilitated diffusion) that operate independently of phosphoribosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1660145335,"A number of potential models for the interaction of cyclic AMP with protein kinase (RC or R2C2) have been examined. These include: Model 1, the simultaneous binding of cyclic AMP and release of C (catalytic subunit) from an independent RC protomer; Model 2, dissociation of an independent RC protomer prior to cyclic AMP binding to R (regulatory subunit); Model 3, cyclic AMP binding to RC prior to the dissociation of C; Model 4, random binding of cyclic AMP and dissociation of C with an interaction factor alpha less than 1; Model 5, release of 2C concomitant with the binding of one cyclic AMP to R2C2 followed by binding of the second cyclic AMP to the vacant R subunit; and Model 6, the simultaneous binding of cyclic AMP and release of C from one RC protomer resulting in a greater affinity of the other RC protomer for cyclic AMP, i.e., a cooperative version of Model 1. All the above models yield [cyclic AMP]0.5 values that increase with increasing protein concentration and Hill plots with average slopes equal to or less than 1.0 in the usual experimental range (10 to 90% of saturation). The Hill plots can be nonlinear, but for each model the exact shape of the plot changes in a characteristic (diagnostic) manner with changing protein concentration. Skeletal muscle protein kinase yields relatively linear Hill plots with napp values greater than 1.0. Consequently, Models 1 to 6 are not likely candidates. However, Model 2 is an excellent alternative model for proteins that display negative cooperativity with respect to the binding of a ligand. The properties of several linear, tetrahedral, and all-or-nothing cooperative models have also been examined. These include Models 7, A, B, and C and 8, A, B, and C which are cooperative versions of Models 2 and 3, respectively, and Model 9, a cooperative version of random Model 4. Model 9 is the most general model from which all others can be derived. Models 9 and 7, A, B, and C in which the prior dissociation of C greatly enhances or is an absolute requirement for cyclic AMP binding to R, are likely candidates for skeletal muscle protein kinase. All four of these models are capable of yielding Hill plots with average slopes greater than 1, and napp values that decrease with increasing protein concentration (in agreement with published data). In addition, in all four models the tight binding of MgATP to R2C2 yields decreased napp values and increased [cyclic AMP]0.5 values (also consistent with published data)."
https://openalex.org/W1998413877,"Perfusion with 0.8 molar ethanol in seawater specifically accelerates the rate of decay of posttetanic potentiation observed after repetitive electrical stimulation of an identified synapse in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia californica. Repeated perfusion with seawater alternately with and without ethanol leads to a progressive diminution of this specific effect of ethanol, such that after the third application ethanol no longer has any effect on the rate constant of decay of posttetanic potentiation. This tolerance to the specific effects of ethanol persists for at least 11 hours after the last application of ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1491089645,"We have investigated the manner by which progesterone receptors act to induce initiation of RNA synthesis in a cell-free system derived from chick oviduct. A method utilizing rifampicin enabled us to measure the formation of binary initiation complexes between RNA polymerase and chick oviduct chromatin (Tsai, M.-J., Schwartz, R.J., Tsai S.Y., and O'Malley, B.W. (1975) J.Biol. Chem. 250, 5165-5174) and allowed for the quantitative assessment of RNA chain initiation sites, RNA chain propagation rates, and RNA chain size under conditions which prevent secondary chain reinitiations. We have measured the available initiation sites for transcription in oviduct chromatin prepared from chicks withdrawn from all hormone and then restimulated with a secondary injection of progesterone. Within 1/2 hour after administration of progesterone, the number of initiation sites increased from 8,700 sites/pg of chromatin DNA for the control to 15,500 sites. After 1 hour, the concentration of RNA polymerase needed to saturate chromatin binding sites was increased 60% in comparison to control values, while the number of initiation sites increased 160%. This rapid increment in transcriptional activity preceded temporally the induction of synthesis of ovalbumin mRNA. To test directly the effect of progesterone receptor on transcription, in vitro, a reconstituted cell-free system was employed which contained purified cytoplasmic progesterone-receptor complexes, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, and chromatin prepared from hormonally withdrawn chick oviducts. Purified progesterone-receptor complex stimulated transcription of oviduct chromatin in vitro by promoting an increase of 3,000 to 5,000 additional sites for RNA chain initiation. These data showed that progesterone receptor can directly increase the number of RNA polymerase binding and initiation sites in the chromatin template in the absence of a detectable change in either the rate of RNA chain propagation or the size of the RNA product. The kinetics of progesterone-receptor stimulation of RNA synthesis in chromatin revealed a t1/2 of 15 min for this effect to occur. This value was identical with the optimal time required for binding of receptor to chromatin. The concentration of receptor required for half-maximal stimulation of RNA chain initiation was approximately 5 x 10(-9) M. This value agreed closely with our previously reported estimates of the affinity (Kd approximately 5 x 10(-9)M) of the progesterone-receptor complex for oviduct chromatin. The stimulatory effect of purified progesterone receptor appeared to be relatively specific for oviduct chromatin in comparison to nontarget tissue chromatins or chick DNA. The data presented here show that steroid hormone-receptor complex can directly regulate gene transcription in vitro in a manner which mimics the events observed in vivo in target cells."
https://openalex.org/W117310306,"Factor(s) that bind gonadotropins have been extracted from rat testis by 30% ethanol (v/v) in water and their interaction with human lutropin (hLH) and human follitropin (hFSH) have been investigated by a new assay using dextran-coated charcoal. These studies reveal that: 1. Maximal binding of gonadotropin with soluble factors was observed over a broad range of pH from 6.0 to 8.0 with a relative decline in binding at extremes of pH. The binding was independent of the ionic strength of the buffer and reached equilibrium within 5 min at 4 degrees, 27 degrees, and 37 degrees. 2. The soluble factors have marked thermostability, a point of distinction from detergent-solubilized receptors. 3. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 125I-hFSH binding to the soluble factor was 6.0 +/- 0.58 X 10(-10) M, consistent with the values obtained from the membrane binding studies. Similarly, the Kd value for 125I-hLH to the soluble factor(s) was 3.33 +/- 0.3 X 10(-9) M, comparable to the values obtained from the membrane binding studies. Hill plots demonstrated a lack of a cooperative relationship with an apparent Hill coefficient of 1.071 for hLH and 0.909 for hFSH. Furthermore, two classes of binding sites for 125I-human choriogonadotropin (hCG) were clearly discernible by both Lineweaver-Burk and Hill plots with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2.4 +/- 0.5 X 10(-11) M and 1.35 +/- 1.2 X 10(-9) M. The apparent Hill coefficient of interaction of 125I-hCG with the soluble factors was found to be 0.923 for high affinity and 1.09 for low affinity binding sites. 4. The binding of 125I-hLH and 125I-hFSH with respect to concentrations of soluble factor(s) was found to be a saturable process, yielding an expected 4.4-fold higher Kd for hLH (294 +/- 13.8 mug/ml) compared to hFSH (66.6 +/- 4 mug/ml). These findings are comparable with the equilibrium dissociation constants, thus confirming a 5-fold higher affinity of hFSH as compared to hLH for the soluble factors, i.e. the ratio of 3.0 X 10(-9) M to 6.0 X 10(-10) M versus the ratio of 294 mug/ml to 66.6 mug/ml. 5. The hormone specificity of the interaction has been studied by using radiolabeled hFSH, hLH, hCG, prolactin, growth hormone, and bovine serum albumin. The binding of FSH at low factor concentrations was found to be 5- to 10-fold greater than prolactin, growth hormone, and albumin. 6. The soluble factors are found in higher concentration in testis compared to liver, kidney, and blood. 7. The effect of ethanol upon solubilization of the factor(s) has been investigated. The factor(s) can be extracted with buffer or water alone. However, 10 to 25% of ethanol (v/v) facilitates the process of solubilization. The treatment with 70% ethanol (v/v) or more did not extract any factor activity from testes. The factor(s) were insoluble in petroleum ether, chloroform, absolute ethanol, methanol, or lipid solvent. 8. Finally the effect of soluble factors on classical membrane binding was investigated..."
https://openalex.org/W2012927805,"Nuclei from SV40-infected monkey cells were isolated late in lytic infection and their cell-free transcriptional activity was characterized. 3H-RNA synthesized in vitro was hybridized to excess quantities of separated SV40 DNA strands which were each covalently bound to Sepharose. It was found that 3-5% of the newly synthesized RNA is virus-specific and that the plus-strand DNA, coding for late RNA sequences, is transcribed at a rate about 15 times higher than that of the minus-strand DNA, which codes for early RNA sequences. This indicates that transcriptional control has a major role in determining the relative abundancy of early and late RNA classes in lytically infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482776315,"The activation rate of bovine prothrombin by Factor Xa and Ca2+ has long been known to be greatly enhanced by addition of phospholipid. Upon substitution of human plasma lipoproteins for phospholipid (cephalin) in this activation system, only very low density lipoprotein enhances prothrombin activation. Low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein have no stimulatory effect on prothrombin activation. On the other hand, the sonicated lipid extracts from very low, low, and high density lipoproteins all can substitute for phospholipid in potentiating prothrombin activation. The efficiency of each lipid extract, in this regard, depends upon its source of extraction, and is greatest for the lipid extract of very low density lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1540008704,"N-Bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate rapidly and irreversibly inactivates rabbit muscle phosphoglycerate mutase. At high molar ratios of reagent to enzyme, loss of activity (both mutase and phosphatase) approximates pseudo-first order kinetics. A rate-saturation effect is observed with half-maximal rate of inactivation occurring at 0.32 mM reagent, a value close to the Km for 3-phosphoglyceric acid. This datum and the dissociation constant of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-enzyme complex, as determined from inactivation kinetics in the presence of the bisphosphate, suggest that the reagent reacts at the substrate binding site. Inactivation results from the covalent incorporation of about 0.8 mol of reagent/mol of catalytic subunit as determined with 14C-labeled reagent. Incorporation is negligible in the presence of substrate and is reduced 8-fold in the presence of 6 M urea. From amino acid analyses on acid hydrolysates of the inactivated enzyme, we have identified a sulfhydryl group as the site of alkylation. A peptide containing the essential sulfhydryl group has been isolated from a tryptic digest of the enzyme inactivated with labeled reagent; its amino acid composition is Trp1, Lys1,-Cys(Cm)1, Asp1, Ser1, Glu2, Gly1, Ala1, Leu1, Phe2."

When ATP and an ATP-regenerating system are included during the resealing stage, (R)-(-)-epinephrine- and NaF-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation, which is linear for 20 min, can be demonstrated. The concentration of (R)-(-)-epinephrine producing a half-maximal response in resealed ghosts is 1.0 +/- 0.4 X 10(-6) M. This is the same as that for (R)-(-)-epinephrine in the intact erythrocyte.

Thus far, we have obtained five lines resistant to EMC, all of which manifest different phenotypes. Three of the five are not persistently infected with virus, while two lines produce infectious virus and grow in its presence. The nonpersistently infected lines exhibit different resistance profiles to the other viruses we have tested, and they are stable in nonselective growth conditions. Their resistance appears to be due to a genetic alteration in the cell."
