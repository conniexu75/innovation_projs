https://openalex.org/W2051833014,"Why Wait? Tropospheric ozone can be dangerous to human health, can be harmful to vegetation, and is a major contributor to climate warming. Black carbon also has significant negative effects on health and air quality and causes warming of the atmosphere. Shindell et al. (p. 183 ) present results of an analysis of emissions, atmospheric processes, and impacts for each of these pollutants. Seven measures were identified that, if rapidly implemented, would significantly reduce global warming over the next 50 years, with the potential to prevent millions of deaths worldwide from outdoor air pollution. Furthermore, some crop yields could be improved by decreasing agricultural damage. Most of the measures thus appear to have economic benefits well above the cost of their implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2081284397,"Experiments suggest that biodiversity enhances the ability of ecosystems to maintain multiple functions, such as carbon storage, productivity, and the buildup of nutrient pools (multifunctionality). However, the relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality has never been assessed globally in natural ecosystems. We report here on a global empirical study relating plant species richness and abiotic factors to multifunctionality in drylands, which collectively cover 41% of Earth's land surface and support over 38% of the human population. Multifunctionality was positively and significantly related to species richness. The best-fitting models accounted for over 55% of the variation in multifunctionality and always included species richness as a predictor variable. Our results suggest that the preservation of plant biodiversity is crucial to buffer negative effects of climate change and desertification in drylands."
https://openalex.org/W2140915719,"Autophagy defends the mammalian cytosol against bacterial infection. Efficient pathogen engulfment is mediated by cargo-selecting autophagy adaptors that rely on unidentified pattern-recognition or danger receptors to label invading pathogens as autophagy cargo, typically by polyubiquitin coating. Here we show in human cells that galectin 8 (also known as LGALS8), a cytosolic lectin, is a danger receptor that restricts Salmonella proliferation. Galectin 8 monitors endosomal and lysosomal integrity and detects bacterial invasion by binding host glycans exposed on damaged Salmonella-containing vacuoles. By recruiting NDP52 (also known as CALCOCO2), galectin 8 activates antibacterial autophagy. Galectin-8-dependent recruitment of NDP52 to Salmonella-containing vesicles is transient and followed by ubiquitin-dependent NDP52 recruitment. Because galectin 8 also detects sterile damage to endosomes or lysosomes, as well as invasion by Listeria or Shigella, we suggest that galectin 8 serves as a versatile receptor for vesicle-damaging pathogens. Our results illustrate how cells deploy the danger receptor galectin 8 to combat infection by monitoring endosomal and lysosomal integrity on the basis of the specific lack of complex carbohydrates in the cytosol."

But do quotas or preferential treatment of applicants alter the pool of candidates? Balafoutas and Sutter (p. 579 ; see the Perspective by Villeval ) used an existing laboratory-based task to assess the change in composition of winning candidates and the overall outcome as a function of three affirmative action policies. Policies designed to encourage more women to enter a competitive environment served to recruit enough high-performing individuals to ensure that the efficiency in performing the task was preserved. Beaman et al. (p. 582 , published online 12 January) examined the effects of a constitutionally mandated reservation of village-council and council-leader positions for women in West Bengal after two election cycles (1998 and 2003). The program appeared to narrow the gender gap in aspirations of parents for their children and of children for themselves; in addition, teenage girls spent more time in school and less on household chores. Beliefs and attitudes changed only after the second set of elections—that is, after a longer exposure to female role models—complementing the more rapid policy changes instituted by women council leaders after the first round of elections."

https://openalex.org/W2020904648,"Criegee Sighting Standard mechanistic models for the reaction of ozone with unsaturated hydrocarbons implicate a transient carbonyl oxide compound, termed the “Criegee intermediate,” which has largely eluded detection. Welz et al. (p. 204 ; see the Perspective by Marston ) have now detected the compound by using mass spectrometry, following the low-pressure photolytic reaction of oxygen with diiodomethane, and measured its decay kinetics in the presence of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Reaction rates were higher than expected, suggesting that the intermediate may play a more prominent role in atmospheric chemistry than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2027232051,"We have observed the superfluid phase transition in a strongly interacting Fermi gas via high-precision measurements of the local compressibility, density and pressure down to near-zero entropy. Our data completely determine the universal thermodynamics of strongly interacting fermions without any fit or external thermometer. The onset of superfluidity is observed in the compressibility, the chemical potential, the entropy, and the heat capacity. In particular, the heat capacity displays a characteristic lambda-like feature at the critical temperature of $T_c/T_F = 0.167(13)$. This is the first clear thermodynamic signature of the superfluid transition in a spin-balanced atomic Fermi gas. Our measurements provide a benchmark for many-body theories on strongly interacting fermions, relevant for problems ranging from high-temperature superconductivity to the equation of state of neutron stars."
https://openalex.org/W2031047087,"Structured Memories High-density magnetic memory is generally produced by using ferromagnetic materials. As the density increases and the memory elements become closer together, stray fields can result in cross-talk and a corruption of the stored information. Antiferromagetic structures, however, are expected to be relatively insensitive to magnetic fields and so should, in principle, allow the elements to be packed in even closer. Loth et al. (p. 196 ) carried out low-temperature experiments to construct antiferromagnetic structures atom by atom. Electrical switching of the magnetic states was observed, and data could be robustly stored on the structure for several hours, albeit at low temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2009759904,"The response of cortical neurons to a sensory stimulus is shaped by the network in which they are embedded. Here we establish a role of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells, a large class of inhibitory neurons that target the soma and perisomatic compartments of pyramidal cells, in controlling cortical responses. By bidirectionally manipulating PV cell activity in visual cortex we show that these neurons strongly modulate layer 2/3 pyramidal cell spiking responses to visual stimuli while only modestly affecting their tuning properties. PV cells' impact on pyramidal cells is captured by a linear transformation, both additive and multiplicative, with a threshold. These results indicate that PV cells are ideally suited to modulate cortical gain and establish a causal relationship between a select neuron type and specific computations performed by the cortex during sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2078455351,"Dispersal in 3D The fabrication of composites containing small proportions of nanoparticles is limited by the ability to disperse the particles uniformly in all three dimensions. Erb et al. (p. 199 ; see the Perspective by Fratzl ) describe a process for creating nanoparticle composites in which a magnetic field is used to align the nanoparticles. Surprisingly, the magnetic alignment of iron-oxide functionalized nanorods and discs was enabled using very small magnetic fields and low-volume fractions of magnetic nanoparticles, which allowed control of the orientation of the nanorods and discs three-dimensionally."
https://openalex.org/W2166159761,"CTCF-binding locations represent regulatory sequences that are highly constrained over the course of evolution. To gain insight into how these DNA elements are conserved and spread through the genome, we defined the full spectrum of CTCF-binding sites, including a 33/34-mer motif, and identified over five thousand highly conserved, robust, and tissue-independent CTCF-binding locations by comparing ChIP-seq data from six mammals. Our data indicate that activation of retroelements has produced species-specific expansions of CTCF binding in rodents, dogs, and opossum, which often functionally serve as chromatin and transcriptional insulators. We discovered fossilized repeat elements flanking deeply conserved CTCF-binding regions, indicating that similar retrotransposon expansions occurred hundreds of millions of years ago. Repeat-driven dispersal of CTCF binding is a fundamental, ancient, and still highly active mechanism of genome evolution in mammalian lineages."

https://openalex.org/W2124700037,"Helminths induce potent T helper 2 (TH2)-type immune responses that can mediate worm expulsion, but the role of this response in controlling the acute tissue damage caused by migrating multicellular parasites through vital tissues remains uncertain. We used a helminth infection model in which parasitic nematode larvae migrate transiently through the lung, resulting in hemorrhage and inflammation. We found that IL-17 initially contributed to inflammation and lung damage, whereas subsequent IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) signaling reduced elevations in IL-17 mRNA levels, enhanced the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IL-10 and stimulated the development of M2 macrophages, all of which contributed to the rapid resolution of tissue damage. These studies indicate an essential role for TH2-type immune responses in mediating acute wound healing during helminth infection."
https://openalex.org/W2107506178,"Robin Gasser and his colleagues report the whole-genome sequence of Schistosoma haematobium. They include comparisons to the genome sequences of S. mansoni and S. japonicum, the two other species that cause schistosomiasis in humans. Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by blood flukes (genus Schistosoma; schistosomes) and affecting 200 million people worldwide1. No vaccines are available, and treatment relies on one drug, praziquantel2. Schistosoma haematobium has come into the spotlight as a major cause of urogenital disease, as an agent linked to bladder cancer1,3 and as a predisposing factor for HIV/AIDS4,5. The parasite is transmitted to humans from freshwater snails1. Worms dwell in blood vessels and release eggs that become embedded in the bladder wall to elicit chronic immune-mediated disease6 and induce squamous cell carcinoma7. Here we sequenced the 385-Mb genome of S. haematobium using Illumina-based technology at 74-fold coverage and compared it to sequences from related parasites8,9. We included genome annotation based on function, gene ontology, networking and pathway mapping. This genome now provides an unprecedented resource for many fundamental research areas and shows great promise for the design of new disease interventions."

https://openalex.org/W2083875480,"Immune Sentinels A classic paradigm in immunology holds that the immune response occurs in two waves: Rapidly responding cells of the innate immune system help to contain the invading pathogen and alert lymphocytes. These cells of the adaptive immune system then help to clear the infection and go on to form long-lasting memory. However, some specialized populations of lymphocytes can also respond quickly to an infection and carry out functions that overlap with the innate immune system. Now, Rauch et al. (p. 597 , published online 12 January) describe one such cell type—innate response activator (IRA) B cells. IRA B cells recognize bacterial liposaccharide through Toll-like receptor 4 and, in response, produce the cytokine GM-CSF, which activates other innate immune cells. Deletion of IRA B cells in mice impaired their ability to clear a bacterial infection and promoted septic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2076757423,"TACE Trafficking The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a major driver of inflammation and contributes to the immune pathology seen in a variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. Soluble TNF is produced by cleavage of its ectodomain by the ADAM family metalloprotease, TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE). However, the molecular regulation of TACE is not understood (see the Perspective by Lichtenthaler ). Adrain et al. (p. 225 ) and McIlwain et al. (p. 229 ) now show that the rhomboid family member iRhom2 interacts with TACE in macrophages and is required for its proper intracellular trafficking and activation. In the absence of iRhom2, TACE was not released from the endoplasmic reticulum, and active protease did not reach the cell surface. Because of an inability to produce TNF, iRhom2-deficient mice were more resistant to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock but could not adequately control a Listeria monocytogenes infection."

https://openalex.org/W1996216733,"Westerly winds in the Southern Ocean have increased in intensity and moved poleward. Using long-term demographic and foraging records, we show that foraging range in wandering albatrosses has shifted poleward in conjunction with these changes in wind pattern, while their rates of travel and flight speeds have increased. Consequently, the duration of foraging trips has decreased, breeding success has improved, and birds have increased in mass by more than 1 kilogram. These positive consequences of climate change may be temporary if patterns of wind in the southern westerlies follow predicted climate change scenarios. This study stresses the importance of foraging performance as the key link between environmental changes and population processes."
https://openalex.org/W2050841253,"Mass spectrometry with stable isotope labels has been seminal in discovering the dynamic state of living matter, but is limited to bulk tissues or cells. We developed multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) that allowed us to view and measure stable isotope incorporation with submicrometre resolution. Here we apply MIMS to diverse organisms, including Drosophila, mice and humans. We test the 'immortal strand hypothesis', which predicts that during asymmetric stem cell division chromosomes containing older template DNA are segregated to the daughter destined to remain a stem cell, thus insuring lifetime genetic stability. After labelling mice with (15)N-thymidine from gestation until post-natal week 8, we find no (15)N label retention by dividing small intestinal crypt cells after a four-week chase. In adult mice administered (15)N-thymidine pulse-chase, we find that proliferating crypt cells dilute the (15)N label, consistent with random strand segregation. We demonstrate the broad utility of MIMS with proof-of-principle studies of lipid turnover in Drosophila and translation to the human haematopoietic system. These studies show that MIMS provides high-resolution quantification of stable isotope labels that cannot be obtained using other techniques and that is broadly applicable to biological and medical research."

https://openalex.org/W2146817116,"The utility of human pluripotent stem cells is dependent on efficient differentiation protocols that convert these cells into relevant adult cell types. Here we report the robust and efficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into white or brown adipocytes. We found that inducible expression of PPARG2 alone or combined with CEBPB and/or PRDM16 in mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from pluripotent stem cells programmed their development towards a white or brown adipocyte cell fate with efficiencies of 85%–90%. These adipocytes retained their identity independent of transgene expression, could be maintained in culture for several weeks, expressed mature markers and had mature functional properties such as lipid catabolism and insulin-responsiveness. When transplanted into mice, the programmed cells gave rise to ectopic fat pads with the morphological and functional characteristics of white or brown adipose tissue. These results indicate that the cells could be used to faithfully model human disease. Cowan and colleagues have developed a method to efficiently differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into functional white or brown adipocytes, through the transient expression of PPARG2 alone or in combination with CEBP and PRDM16. The programmed cells are able to give rise to ectopic fat pads with white or brown adipose tissue characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W2018385101,"Hair cells of the inner ear are not normally replaced during an animal's life, and must continually renew components of their various organelles. Among these are the stereocilia, each with a core of several hundred actin filaments that arise from their apical surfaces and that bear the mechanotransduction apparatus at their tips. Actin turnover in stereocilia has previously been studied by transfecting neonatal rat hair cells in culture with a β-actin-GFP fusion, and evidence was found that actin is replaced, from the top down, in 2-3 days. Overexpression of the actin-binding protein espin causes elongation of stereocilia within 12-24 hours, also suggesting rapid regulation of stereocilia lengths. Similarly, the mechanosensory 'tip links' are replaced in 5-10 hours after cleavage in chicken and mammalian hair cells. In contrast, turnover in chick stereocilia in vivo is much slower. It might be that only certain components of stereocilia turn over quickly, that rapid turnover occurs only in neonatal animals, only in culture, or only in response to a challenge like breakage or actin overexpression. Here we quantify protein turnover by feeding animals with a (15)N-labelled precursor amino acid and using multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry to measure appearance of new protein. Surprisingly, in adult frogs and mice and in neonatal mice, in vivo and in vitro, the stereocilia were remarkably stable, incorporating newly synthesized protein at <10% per day. Only stereocilia tips had rapid turnover and no treadmilling was observed. Other methods confirmed this: in hair cells expressing β-actin-GFP we bleached fiducial lines across hair bundles, but they did not move in 6 days. When we stopped expression of β- or γ-actin with tamoxifen-inducible recombination, neither actin isoform left the stereocilia, except at the tips. Thus, rapid turnover in stereocilia occurs only at the tips and not by a treadmilling process."

Kanner et al. (p. 570 , published online 12 January; see the Perspective by Rodbell ) present a stable isotope record from the central Peruvian Andes, which represents a record of the South American Summer Monsoon from 50,000 to 16,000 years ago and which contains the signals of D/O and Heinrich events. The Southern Hemisphere monsoon displayed an antiphase relationship to Northern Hemisphere monsoon intensity at the millennial scale, and Antarctic millennial-scale climate fluctuations influenced the South American Summer Monsoon."
https://openalex.org/W2026441189,"In this study, the authors show that Psd-95 mRNA is regulated by an alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay mechanism involving PTBP1 and PTBP2. The downregulation of these proteins with development allows for the expression of PSD-95 and synaptic maturation. Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is essential for synaptic maturation and plasticity. Although its synaptic regulation has been widely studied, the control of PSD-95 cellular expression is not understood. We found that Psd-95 was controlled post-transcriptionally during neural development. Psd-95 was transcribed early in mouse embryonic brain, but most of its product transcripts were degraded. The polypyrimidine tract binding proteins PTBP1 and PTBP2 repressed Psd-95 (also known as Dlg4) exon 18 splicing, leading to premature translation termination and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The loss of first PTBP1 and then of PTBP2 during embryonic development allowed splicing of exon 18 and expression of PSD-95 late in neuronal maturation. Re-expression of PTBP1 or PTBP2 in differentiated neurons inhibited PSD-95 expression and impaired the development of glutamatergic synapses. Thus, expression of PSD-95 during early neural development is controlled at the RNA level by two PTB proteins whose sequential downregulation is necessary for synapse maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2165263771,"The bottom-up contribution to the allocation of exogenous attention is a saliency map, whose neural substrate is hard to identify because of possible contamination by top-down signals. We obviated this possibility using stimuli that observers could not perceive, but that nevertheless, through orientation contrast between foreground and background regions, attracted attention to improve a localized visual discrimination. When orientation contrast increased, so did the degree of attraction, and two physiological measures: the amplitude of the earliest (C1) component of the ERP, which is associated with primary visual cortex, and fMRI BOLD signals in areas V1-V4 (but not the intraparietal sulcus). Significantly, across observers, the degree of attraction correlated with the C1 amplitude and just the V1 BOLD signal. These findings strongly support the proposal that a bottom-up saliency map is created in V1, challenging the dominant view that the saliency map is generated in the parietal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2169962074,"Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal cortex, including the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), can represent the category membership of stimuli. Category signals in LIP were thought to result from top-down feedback from the PFC. Here the authors show that category signals in the LIP are stronger, more reliable and occur earlier than those in the PFC. The ability to recognize the behavioral relevance, or category membership, of sensory stimuli is critical for interpreting the meaning of events in our environment. Neurophysiological studies of visual categorization have found categorical representations of stimuli in prefrontal cortex (PFC), an area that is closely associated with cognitive and executive functions. Recent studies have also identified neuronal category signals in parietal areas that are typically associated with visual-spatial processing. It has been proposed that category-related signals in parietal cortex and other visual areas may result from 'top-down' feedback from PFC. We directly compared neuronal activity in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area and PFC in monkeys performing a visual motion categorization task. We found that LIP showed stronger, more reliable and shorter latency category signals than PFC. These findings suggest that LIP is strongly involved in visual categorization and argue against the idea that parietal category signals arise as a result of feedback from PFC during this task."
https://openalex.org/W2073654616,"Tubulin glutamylation is a post-translational modification that occurs predominantly in the ciliary axoneme and has been suggested to be important for ciliary function. However, its relationship to disorders of the primary cilium, termed ciliopathies, has not been explored. Here we mapped a new locus for Joubert syndrome (JBTS), which we have designated as JBTS15, and identified causative mutations in CEP41, which encodes a 41-kDa centrosomal protein. We show that CEP41 is localized to the basal body and primary cilia, and regulates ciliary entry of TTLL6, an evolutionarily conserved polyglutamylase enzyme. Depletion of CEP41 causes ciliopathy-related phenotypes in zebrafish and mice and results in glutamylation defects in the ciliary axoneme. Our data identify CEP41 mutations as a cause of JBTS and implicate tubulin post-translational modification in the pathogenesis of human ciliary dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2075446232,"Blood pressure regulation is crucial for the maintenance of health, and hypertension is a risk factor for myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and renal disease. Nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin trigger well-defined vasodilator pathways; however, substantial vasorelaxation in response to agents such as acetylcholine persists when the synthesis of these molecules is prevented. This remaining vasorelaxation activity, termed endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), is more prevalent in resistance than in conduit blood vessels and is considered a major mechanism for blood pressure control. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been shown to be a major component of EDHF in several vascular beds in multiple species, including in humans. H2O2 causes the formation of a disulfide bond between the two α subunits of protein kinase G I-α (PKGI-α), which activates the kinase independently of the NO-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway and is coupled to vasodilation. To test the importance of PKGI-α oxidation in the EDHF mechanism and blood pressure control in vivo, we generated a knock-in mouse expressing only a C42S 'redox-dead' version of PKGI-α. This amino acid substitution, a single-atom change (an oxygen atom replacing a sulfur atom), blocked the vasodilatory action of H2O2 on resistance vessels and resulted in hypertension in vivo."

The phenotype was explained by a defect in secretion of the micronemes, an apicomplexan-specific organelle that contains adhesion proteins. A T. gondii Doc2 gene was identified, by whole-genome sequencing, to be involved in the secretion defect, and a conditional allele of the orthologous gene engineered into the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , also caused defects in microneme secretion."

We identified ABCB6 as the genetic basis of the Lan blood group antigen expressed on red blood cells but also at the plasma membrane of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and we established that ABCB6 encodes a new blood group system (Langereis, Lan). Targeted sequencing of ABCB6 in 12 unrelated individuals of the Lan(-) blood type identified 10 different ABCB6 null mutations. This is the first report of deficient alleles of this human ABC transporter gene. Of note, Lan(-) (ABCB6(-/-)) individuals do not suffer any clinical consequences, although their deficiency in ABCB6 may place them at risk when determining drug dosage."
https://openalex.org/W2074478109,"In this study, the authors show that mDia1 and mDia3 are necessary for the tangential migration of interneuron precursors, but are dispensable for radial migration. These proteins act via a Rho/ROCK-mediated pathway to regulate F-actin accumulation and nuclear translocation. In brain development, distinct types of migration, radial migration and tangential migration, are shown by excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively. Whether these two types of migration operate by similar cellular mechanisms remains unclear. We examined neuronal migration in mice deficient in mDia1 (also known as Diap1) and mDia3 (also known as Diap2), which encode the Rho-regulated actin nucleators mammalian diaphanous homolog 1 (mDia1) and mDia3. mDia deficiency impaired tangential migration of cortical and olfactory inhibitory interneurons, whereas radial migration and consequent layer formation of cortical excitatory neurons were unaffected. mDia-deficient neuroblasts exhibited reduced separation of the centrosome from the nucleus and retarded nuclear translocation. Concomitantly, anterograde F-actin movement and F-actin condensation at the rear, which occur during centrosomal and nuclear movement of wild-type cells, respectively, were impaired in mDia-deficient neuroblasts. Blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), which regulates myosin II, also impaired nuclear translocation. These results suggest that Rho signaling via mDia and ROCK critically regulates nuclear translocation through F-actin dynamics in tangential migration, whereas this mechanism is dispensable in radial migration."
https://openalex.org/W2040950751,"The breast cancer resistance protein, also known as ABCG2, is one of the most highly studied ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters because of its ability to confer multidrug resistance. The lack of information on the physiological role of ABCG2 in humans severely limits cancer chemotherapeutic approaches targeting this transporter. We report here that ABCG2 comprises the molecular basis of a new blood group system (Junior, Jr) and that individuals of the Jr(a-) blood type have inherited two null alleles of ABCG2. We identified five frameshift and three nonsense mutations in ABCG2. We also show that the prevalence of the Jr(a-) blood type in the Japanese and European Gypsy populations is related to the p.Gln126* and p.Arg236* protein alterations, respectively. The identification of ABCG2(-/-) (Jr(a-)) individuals who appear phenotypically normal is an essential step toward targeting ABCG2 in cancer and also in understanding the physiological and pharmacological roles of this promiscuous transporter in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1973709911,"Here we provide evidence that revises the inhibitory circuit diagram of the cerebellar cortex. It was previously thought that Golgi cells, interneurons that are the sole source of inhibition onto granule cells, were exclusively coupled via gap junctions. Moreover, Golgi cells were believed to receive GABAergic inhibition from molecular layer interneurons (MLIs). Here we challenge these views by optogenetically activating the cerebellar circuitry to determine the timing and pharmacology of inhibition onto Golgi cells and by performing paired recordings to directly assess synaptic connectivity. In contrast to current thought, we find that Golgi cells, not MLIs, make inhibitory GABAergic synapses onto other Golgi cells. As a result, MLI feedback does not regulate the Golgi cell network, and Golgi cells are inhibited approximately 2 ms before Purkinje cells, following a mossy fiber input. Hence, Golgi cells and Purkinje cells receive unique sources of inhibition and can differentially process shared granule cell inputs."

Here we investigate whether the chemical milieu of cells has the potential to alleviate intracellular protein folding, a possibility that could implicate osmolytes in concealing genetic variations. We found that the model osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) can buffer mutations that impose kinetic traps in the folding pathways of two model proteins. Using this information, we rationally designed TMAO-dependent mutants in vivo, starting from a TMAO-independent protein. We show that different osmolytes buffer a unique spectrum of mutations. Consequently, the chemical milieu of cells may alter the folding pathways of unique mutant variants in polymorphic populations and lead to unanticipated spectra of genetic buffering."

Chronic pain is often associated with synaptic potentiation in nociceptive pathways. A brief, high-dose application of opioids depotentiated long-term potentiation in spinal pain pathways. The same dose also reversed hyperalgesia in behaving animals. Thus, opioids not only attenuate pain but also may eradicate a significant cause for chronic pain."

Gaining insight into how physical factors influence residence times (1/k(off)) should enhance our ability to manipulate biological interactions. We report experiments that yield structural insight into k(off) involving a series of eight 2,4-diaminopyrimidine inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase whose binding affinities vary by six orders of magnitude. NMR relaxation-dispersion experiments revealed a common set of residues near the binding site that undergo a concerted millisecond-timescale switching event to a previously unidentified conformation. The rate of switching from ground to excited conformations correlates exponentially with the binding affinity K(i) and k(off), suggesting that protein dynamics serves as a mechanical initiator of ligand dissociation within this series and potentially for other macromolecule-ligand systems. Although the forward rate of conformational exchange, k(conf,forward), is faster than k(off), the use of the ligand series allowed for connections to be drawn between kinetic events on different timescales."

The four GluN2 subunits (GluN2A–D) contribute to four diheteromeric NMDAR subtypes that have divergent physiological and pathological roles. Channel properties that are fundamental to NMDAR function vary among subtypes. We investigated the amino acid residues responsible for variations in channel properties by creating and examining NMDARs containing mutant GluN2 subunits. We found that the NMDAR subtype specificity of three crucial channel properties, Mg2+ block, selective permeability to Ca2+ and single-channel conductance, were all controlled primarily by the residue at a single GluN2 site in the M3 transmembrane region. Mutant cycle analysis guided by molecular modeling revealed that a GluN2-GluN1 subunit interaction mediates the site's effects. We conclude that a single GluN2 subunit residue couples with the pore-forming loop of the GluN1 subunit to create naturally occurring variations in NMDAR properties that are critical to synaptic plasticity and learning."
https://openalex.org/W1579400675,"Gamma-ray binaries are stellar systems containing a neutron star or black hole with gamma-ray emission produced by an interaction between the components. These systems are rare, even though binary evolution models predict dozens in our Galaxy. A search for gamma-ray binaries with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) shows that 1FGL J1018.6-5856 exhibits intensity and spectral modulation with a 16.6 day period. We identified a variable X-ray counterpart, which shows a sharp maximum coinciding with maximum gamma-ray emission, as well as an O6V((f)) star optical counterpart and a radio counterpart that is also apparently modulated on the orbital period. 1FGL J1018.6-5856 is thus a gamma-ray binary, and its detection suggests the presence of other fainter binaries in the Galaxy."

The condensation of these fractionalized particles has been predicted to drive unusual quantum phase transitions. Through numerical and theoretical analysis of a physical model of interacting lattice bosons, we establish the existence of such an exotic critical point, called XY*. We measure a highly nonclassical critical exponent η = 1.493 and construct a universal scaling function of winding number distributions that directly demonstrates the distinct topological sectors of an emergent Z(2) gauge field. The universal quantities used to establish this exotic transition can be used to detect other fractionalized quantum critical points in future model and material systems."
https://openalex.org/W2125189194,"As a precursor to the selection of a stimulus for gaze and attention, a midbrain network categorizes stimuli into “strongest” and “others.” The categorization tracks flexibly, in real time, the absolute strength of the strongest stimulus. In this study, we take a first-principles approach to computations that are essential for such categorization. We demonstrate that classical feedforward lateral inhibition cannot produce flexible categorization. However, circuits in which the strength of lateral inhibition varies with the relative strength of competing stimuli categorize successfully. One particular implementation—reciprocal inhibition of feedforward lateral inhibition—is structurally the simplest, and it outperforms others in flexibly categorizing rapidly and reliably. Strong predictions of this anatomically supported circuit model are validated by neural responses measured in the owl midbrain. The results demonstrate the extraordinary power of a remarkably simple, neurally grounded circuit motif in producing flexible categorization, a computation fundamental to attention, perception, and decision making."

https://openalex.org/W2105603108,"We perceive real-world objects as three-dimensional (3D), yet it is unknown which brain area underlies our ability to perceive objects in this way. The macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex contains neurons that respond selectively to 3D structures defined by binocular disparity. To examine the causal role of IT in the categorization of 3D structures, we electrically stimulated clusters of IT neurons with a similar 3D-structure preference while monkeys performed a 3D-structure categorization task. Microstimulation of 3D-structure-selective IT clusters caused monkeys to choose the preferred structure of the 3D-structure-selective neurons considerably more often. Microstimulation in IT also accelerated the monkeys' choice for the preferred structure, while delaying choices corresponding to the nonpreferred structure of a given site. These findings reveal that 3D-structure-selective neurons in IT contribute to the categorization of 3D objects."
