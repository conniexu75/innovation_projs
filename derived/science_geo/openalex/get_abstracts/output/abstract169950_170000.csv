https://openalex.org/W2119413986,"In humans, low peak bone mass is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis. We report that LRP5, encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5, affects bone mass accrual during growth. Mutations in LRP5 cause the autosomal recessive disorder osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG). We find that OPPG carriers have reduced bone mass when compared to age- and gender-matched controls. We demonstrate LRP5 expression by osteoblasts in situ and show that LRP5 can transduce Wnt signaling in vitro via the canonical pathway. We further show that a mutant-secreted form of LRP5 can reduce bone thickness in mouse calvarial explant cultures. These data indicate that Wnt-mediated signaling via LRP5 affects bone accrual during growth and is important for the establishment of peak bone mass."

https://openalex.org/W2154166273,"We have investigated the role of trigger RNA amplification during RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Analysis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced during RNAi in C. elegans revealed a substantial fraction that cannot derive directly from input dsRNA. Instead, a population of siRNAs (termed secondary siRNAs) appeared to derive from the action of a cellular RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) on mRNAs that are being targeted by the RNAi mechanism. The distribution of secondary siRNAs exhibited a distinct polarity (5′→3′ on the antisense strand), suggesting a cyclic amplification process in which RdRP is primed by existing siRNAs. This amplification mechanism substantially augments the potency of RNAi-based surveillance, while ensuring that the RNAi machinery will focus on expressed mRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2110811750,"Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) function causes the fragile X mental retardation syndrome. FMRP harbors three RNA binding domains, associates with polysomes, and is thought to regulate mRNA translation and/or localization, but the RNAs to which it binds are unknown. We have used RNA selection to demonstrate that the FMRP RGG box binds intramolecular G quartets. This data allowed us to identify mRNAs encoding proteins involved in synaptic or developmental neurobiology that harbor FMRP binding elements. The majority of these mRNAs have an altered polysome association in fragile X patient cells. These data demonstrate that G quartets serve as physiologically relevant targets for FMRP and identify mRNAs whose dysregulation may underlie human mental retardation."
https://openalex.org/W2080611091,"When hippocampal synapses in culture are pharmacologically silenced for several days, synaptic strength increases. The structural correlate of this change in strength is an increase in the size of the synapses, with all synaptic components—active zone, postsynaptic density, and bouton—becoming larger. Further, the number of docked vesicles and the total number of vesicles per synapse increases, although the number of docked vesicles per area of active zone is unchanged. In parallel with these anatomical changes, the physiologically measured size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) and the release probability are increased. Ultrastructural analysis of individual synapses in which the RRP was previously measured reveals that, within measurement error, the same number of vesicles are docked as are estimated to be in the RRP."

From in vitro assays, HSL is known to hydrolyze TG, diglycerides (DG), cholesteryl esters, and retinyl esters. In the current study we have generated HSL knock-out mice and demonstrate three lines of evidence that HSL is instrumental in the catabolism of DG in vivo. First, HSL deficiency in mice causes the accumulation of DG in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and testis. Second, when tissue extracts were used in an in vitro lipase assay, a reduced FFA release and the accumulation of DG was observed in HSL knock-out mice which did not occur when tissue extracts from control mice were used. Third, in vitro lipolysis experiments with HSL-deficient fat pads demonstrated that the isoproterenol-stimulated release of FFA was decreased and DG accumulated intracellularly resulting in the essential absence of the isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol formation typically observed in control fat pads. Additionally, the absence of HSL in white adipose tissue caused a shift of the fatty acid composition of the TG moiety toward increased long chain fatty acids implying a substrate specificity of the enzymein vivo. From these in vivo results we conclude that HSL is the rate-limiting enzyme for the cellular catabolism of DG in adipose tissue and muscle.

Human HSL is composed of 775 amino acids that are encoded by a 2.9-kb mRNA transcribed from a single gene composed of 9 exons (1Langin D. Laurell H. Holst L.S. Belfrage P. Holm C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A tissue-specific size variation has been observed in testis where an additional exon 13 kb upstream of exon 1 in adipose tissue gives rise to a 3.9-kb mRNA and a 1076-amino acid protein (3Holst L.S.

The molecular basis of size variations in HSL mRNA in muscle, macrophages, and ovaries is unknown.HSL-mediated lipolysis is strictly controlled by hormones. The enzyme is activated by catecholamines and other lipolytic hormones upon phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and the lipotransin-mediated translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the lipid droplet (4McKnight G.S. Cummings D.E. Amieux P.S. Sikorski M.A. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 139-161PubMed Google Scholar, 5Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kraemer F.B.

Insulin, the major antilipolytic hormone, inhibits HSL through phosphodiesterase-3-dependent cAMP degradation and interference with the lipotransin-mediated enzyme translocation. Accordingly, mice with elevated protein kinase A activity exhibit increased lipolysis and a lean phenotype (7Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Absence of perilipin in mice also resulted in leanness through constitutive activation of HSL (8Martinez Botas J. Anderson J.B.

Conversely, mice that lack the insulin receptor substrate 2 become obese (9Burks D.J. de Mora J.F. Schubert M. Withers D.J. Myers M.G. Towery H.H. Altamuro S.L. Flint C.L. White M.F.

These results imply that imbalances between lipid accumulation and fat mobilization in adipose tissue due to the dysregulation of HSL might contribute to the development of obesity and related disorders (10Coppack S.W.

These effects are explained by the ability of FFA and their derivatives to regulate lipogenic genes by the activation of nuclear receptors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and sterol-responsive element-binding protein-1/adipocyte differentiation-dependent factor (17Distel R.J.

Thus, HSL is considered to be an important enzyme in the maintenance of energy homeostasis.A particular feature of HSL is its multifunctional ability to hydrolyze TG, diglycerides (DG), monoglycerides (MG), cholesteryl esters (CE), and retinyl esters in various tissues (22Belfrage P. Jergil B. Stralfors P. Tornqvist H. FEBS Lett. 1977; 75: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Yeaman S.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14159-14165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The enzyme exhibits an ∼10-fold higher specific activity for DG compared with TG, MG, or CE (22Belfrage P. Jergil B. Stralfors P. Tornqvist H. FEBS Lett. 1977; 75: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) when analyzed in in vitro assay systems, suggesting a specific role of the enzyme in DG catabolism. The view that HSL is the rate-limiting enzyme for TG hydrolysis, however, has recently been challenged by the demonstration that HSL-deficient mice exhibited normal body weight and were still able to catabolize adipose tissue fat stores (26Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that at least one additional TG hydrolase must exist in adipose tissue to compensate for the lack of HSL.To define further the role of HSL in the lipolytic breakdown of TG, DG, and MG, we now demonstrate that HSL-ko mice accumulate DG in various tissues including adipose tissue. This block of diglyceride hydrolysis results in the absence of the isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol release from adipose tissue. Additionally, we demonstrate a preferred substrate specificity of HSL for long chain fatty acids within acylglyceride substrates.DISCUSSIONThe functional role of HSL in adipocytes and other cell types and tissues is insufficiently understood. In vitro studies have shown that in addition to TG, HSL catalyzes the hydrolysis of DG, MG (37Fredrikson G. Stralfors P. Nilsson N.O. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6311-6320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fredrikson G. Tornqvist H. Belfrage P. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1996; 318: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and retinyl esters (25Wei S. Lai K. Patel S. Piantedosi R. Shen H. Colantuoni V. Kraemer F.B. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14159-14165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was previously believed that the enzyme catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in the catabolism of adipose tissue TG depots, namely the hydrolytic cleavage of the primary ester bonds of TG. This essential role of HSL, however, was questioned when HSL-ko mice were shown to have normal body weight and white adipose tissue mass (26Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These findings suggested the existence of other TG-mobilizing enzymes in adipose tissue.To define the functional role of HSL in various tissues, HSL-ko mice were generated, and the effects of HSL deficiency on the intracellular lipid metabolism were studied in adipose tissue, muscle, testis, liver, and brain. In a first step, a targeting vector was assembled containing a loxP flanked selection cassette within intron 1 and a single loxP site within intron 7. After homologous recombination in an embryonic stem cell line, the bacteriophage-derived Cre-loxP recombination system (27Hoess R.H. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3398-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 41Sternberg N. Hamilton D. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 487-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 42Sauer B. Henderson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5166-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) was utilized to eliminate the selection marker gene and exons 2–7 of the endogenous HSL gene. This strategy was utilized to avoid possible perturbations of the HSL-ko phenotype through expression of the selection marker (43Hasty P. Ramirez Solis R. Krumlauf R. Bradley A. Nature. 1991; 350: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 44Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2819-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HSL-deficient mice appeared grossly normal; however, male animals were sterile due to gonadal hypotrophy and oligospermia as reported by previously Osuga et al. (26Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).The disruption of the HSL gene in mice caused a defect in the catabolism of cellular DG. TLC analysis of tissue lipid extracts revealed a massive accumulation of DG in various tissues which was verified by ESI mass spectrometry. Defective DG hydrolysis in the absence of HSL was further substantiated by two experimental approaches. First, in vitro TG-lipase assays were performed employing an artificial TG substrate and extracts from HSL-ko and control tissues. This assay permitted the determination of the total acylglyceride lipase activity of the extract (equals total FFA release), the formation of DG, and the specific TG hydrolase activity (conversion of TG to DG) in every tissue analyzed. Second, lipolysis experiments were performed with isoproterenol-stimulated HSL-ko fat pads to determine the hormone-induced release of FFA and glycerol in WAT in the presence and absence of HSL.From these experiments it became evident that in HSL-deficient WAT both the hydrolysis of TG and the hydrolysis of DG are impaired. Decreased FFA and increased DG accumulation led to a drastic (20-fold) decrease in the FFA/DG ratio when WAT extracts from HSL-ko mice were used inin vitro lipase assays. However, this defect in the lipolytic cascade was not associated with increased WAT TG content nor increased fat mass in HSL-ko animals. Similar observations were reported by Osuga et al. (26Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 45Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.F. Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lipolysis experiments with isoproterenol-stimulated pieces of HSL-ko fat pads also revealed that the net release of FFA was reduced relative to controls. A specific inhibition of DG hydrolysis resulted in intracellular DG accumulation and drastically reduced glycerol formation in HSL-ko fat pads. The molar FFA/glycerol ratio after isoproterenol stimulation was comparatively low in both HSL-ko WAT and control WAT providing evidence for the efficient reesterification of FFA within a futile cycle. Efficient reusage of lipolyzed FFA for reesterification and lipid deposition has been reported previously (46Raclot T. Oudart H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in studies with WAT fragments. As a consequence of the defect in the lipolytic cascade in HSL-ko mice, the decreased release of FFA into the vascular system causes reduced plasma levels of FFA and glycerol (26Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Taken together these results indicate that the lipolytic cascade is impaired in WAT in the absence of HSL. However, at least one alternative TG hydrolase must exist in addition to HSL to compensate for the breakdown of stored TG in the absence of HSL. A possible candidate is a recently cloned neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase/TG hydrolase (47Wallace T.J. Kodsi E.M. Langston T.B. Gergis M.R. Grogan W.M J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33165-33174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 48Dolinsky V.W. Sipione S. Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that was found to be expressed in various tissues including WAT. The fact that HSL-ko mice are not obese despite their apparent defect in TG and DG hydrolysis is unexpected and suggests a putative compensatory down-regulation of TG synthesis in HSL-deficient WAT.In addition to the increased DG levels observed in HSL-deficient WAT, ESI mass spectroscopy and GC analysis of WAT lipid extracts revealed a relative increase of long chain unsaturated fatty acids (18:1 and 18:2) in DG and TG of HSL-ko WAT. Conversely, when lipolysis experiments were performed with isoproterenol-stimulated fat pads, the release of 18:1 and 18:2 fatty acids was decreased. From these in vivoresults we conclude that HSL exhibits substrate specificity for long chain fatty acids. Evidence for substrate specificity of HSL in vitro has been reported recently (49Raclot T. Holm C. Langin D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of HSL might be associated with the polarity of TG in adipose tissue (19Raclot T. Oudart H. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1999; 58: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 50Raclot T. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 51Raclot T. Langin D. Lafontan M. Groscolas R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Similarly to the situation observed in WAT, the BAT DG content is also increased due to the decreased hydrolysis of DG. In contrast to WAT, however, BAT exhibited normal TG hydrolase activity suggesting that in the absence of HSL the conversion of TG to DG is facilitated by an alternative pathway that entirely compensates for HSL. Expectedly, the impaired lipolytic breakdown of DG to glycerol and FFA led to decreased total FFA release in HSL-deficient adipose tissue extracts whenin vitro lipolysis experiments were performed. This defect might be responsible for the morphological changes observed in BAT, which resulted in increased BAT lipid content and BAT hypertrophy (26Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).In skeletal muscle, HSL deficiency also caused DG accumulation, whereas specific TG hydrolase activity was normal. This finding argues for a functional role of HSL in the mobilization of skeletal muscle lipid stores, specifically in the catabolism of DG. It has been proposed previously (15Langfort J. Ploug T. Ihlemann J. Enevoldsen L.H. Stallknecht B. Saldo M. Kjaer M. Holm C. Galbo H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 441: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 53Langfort J. Ploug T. Ihlemann J. Saldo M. Holm C. Galbo H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that HSL might participate in the breakdown of lipid droplets that are present in the cytoplasm of skeletal myocytes. However, the main energy supply for skeletal muscle is provided by the glycolytic degradation of glucose. Accordingly, skeletal muscle TG stores were not altered in HSL-ko mice. In contrast to skeletal muscle, the metabolic requirements of cardiac muscle are met by an extremely high lipolytic turnover of myocardial TG (54de Groot M.J. Willemsen P.H. Coumans W.A. van Bilsen M. van der Vusse G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cardiac muscle TG breakdown is under acute hormonal control, and the discovery of HSL in cardiomyocytes (2Holm C. Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Fredrikson G. Nilsson S. Miller C.G. Shively J.E. Heinzmann C. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Science. 1988; 241: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 55Small C.A. Garton A.J. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggests that HSL is responsible for the intracellular lipolysis of TG. Our data confirm the presence of HSL in cardiomyocytes and assign it an important role in the catabolism of DG. Similar to the situation in skeletal muscle, HSL deficiency in cardiac muscle causes tissue DG accumulation while the conversion of TG to DG is not affected, again arguing for the existence of an alternative TG hydrolase that can compensate for HSL deficiency.In the liver, HSL deficiency caused reduced acylglyceride hydrolase activity with a concomitant accumulation of DG, indicating that HSL is present and functional in liver. This finding is in contrast to previous studies (2Holm C. Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Fredrikson G. Nilsson S. Miller C.G. Shively J.E. Heinzmann C. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Science. 1988; 241: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39Holm C. Belfrage P. Fredrikson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that assumed that HSL is not expressed in liver cells. However, liver TG contents from fasted HSL-ko mice were strongly decreased implying an HSL-independent effective lipase system for mobilization of liver TG stores. From the observed absence of acylglyceride hydrolase activity in the brain of HSL-ko mice, we conclude that HSL is present and functionally active in the brain. The physiological role of HSL in both the liver and the brain, however, remains to be elucidated.Our results provide conclusive evidence that HSL represents an important DG hydrolase that, when absent, provokes intracellular DG accumulation. In all tissues the FFA/DG ratio is drastically decreased between 3- and 36-fold. The tissue-specific differences in the FFA/DG ratio are likely the result of a complex scenario. In adipose tissue where lipolytic activities and the fat content are high and where reusage of lipolyzed FFA for TG synthesis within a futile cycle is well established, the FFA/DG ratio might be more affected than in other tissues. Alternatively, it is conceivable that other DG hydrolases that are differently expressed in various tissues are responsible for the variation of the FFA/DG ratio among tissues. The instrumental function of HSL as a DG hydrolase is consistent with earlier in vitrostudies demonstrating that HSL can catalyze the hydrolysis of DG at a much higher rate than TG (37Fredrikson G.

In normal cells the DG concentration is very low, and DG degradation is not rate-limiting during hormonally stimulated lipolysis (59Soma M.R. Mims M.P. Chari M.V. Rees D. Morrisett J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11168-11175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prevention of intracellular DG accumulation by efficient catabolism seems physiologically meaningful considering the potent activity of DG as a second messenger molecule (52Quest A.F. Ghosh S.

Whether HSL-ko mice exhibit altered cellular functions in response to increased DG levels is currently unknown.Taken together, our results indicate that HSL is rate-limiting in the catabolism of cellular DG. In contrast, and in agreement with previous studies, the enzyme appears not to be rate-limiting for TG hydrolysis.

To determine whether the two PR regulate different genes, we used human breast cancer cell lines engineered to express one or the other isoform.

In vivo, the two PR isoforms are usually coexpressed in normal cells, yet their ratio varies dramatically in different tissues, physiological states, and in disease (20Boyd-Leinen P.A. Fournier D.

With regard to the mammary gland, in transgenic mice, 3:1 overexpression of PR-A over PR-B results in extensive epithelial cell hyperplasia, excessive ductal branching, and a disorganized basement membrane, all features associated with neoplasia (31Shyamala G. Yang X. Silberstein G. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Dale E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of PR-B leads to premature ductal growth arrest and inadequate lobulo-alveolar differentiation (32Shyamala G. Yang X. Cardiff R.D. Dale E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3044-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PR-A null mice, which express only PR-B, exhibit normal mammary gland development, yet the same mice display severe uterine hyperplasia and reproductive defects (4Mulac-Jericevic B. Mullinax R.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P. Conneely O.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1751-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that PR-A and PR-B have physiologically different functions in different tissues and that alterations in their ratios carry different consequences depending on the tissue. Although PR levels are routinely measured in breast cancers for clinical decision making, only two studies have examined the levels of the two isoforms. An analysis of 202 PR-positive breast cancers by immunoblotting shows that expression levels of PR-A are higher than PR-B in 59% of tumors and are 4-fold or greater in 25% of tumors (33Graham J.D. Yeates C. Balleine R.L. Harvey S.S. Milliken J.S. Bilous A.M. Clarke C.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5063-5068PubMed Google Scholar). In another study of 32 PR-positive breast cancers, excess PR-B correlated with the absence of Her-2/neu indicating a good prognosis, whereas excess PR-A correlated with a poorly differentiated phenotype and higher tumor grade (34Bamberger A.M. Milde-Langosch K. Schulte H.M. Loning T. Horm. Res. (Basel). 2000; 54: 32-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of PR-A in cultured human breast cancer cells results in marked morphological changes and loss of adherent properties (35McGowan E.M. Clarke C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1657-1671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting, as do the transgenic mice data, that an excess of PR-A is particularly harmful in the breast. Little is known at present about the molecular mechanisms that might explain these differences. We therefore undertook the first systematic, large scale comparison of gene regulation by the two PR, using a unique human breast cancer cell model for this purpose. Wild-type T47Dco breast cancer cells express equimolar levels of PR-A and PR-B in an estrogen-independent manner (36Horwitz K.B. Mockus M.B. Lessey B.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 633-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To study differential gene regulation by the two PR isoforms independently, we isolated a PR-negative subline of T47Dco (designated T47D-Y cells) and then engineered the T47D-Y to stably express equivalent levels of either PR-B (T47D-YB cells) or PR-A (T47D-YA cells) (37Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3668-3877PubMed Google Scholar). Because these are pure cell populations, and all of the cells have the same parental-cell background, the PR isoform-specific effects of progesterone on gene transcription can be quantitatively and reproducibly investigated in a tightly controlled manner. Our data, based on triplicate determinations, demonstrate that in response to progesterone, PR-A and PR-B primarily regulate different subsets of genes, and although PR-B are transcriptionally more active, there are genes that are uniquely regulated by PR-A. These subsets include genes known to be involved in breast cancer and/or mammary gland development but not previously known to be progesterone targets. Progesterone regulation of many of these genes would be deleterious in breast cancers. A surprisingly large number of genes are targeted to the cell membrane or involved in membrane-initiated signaling. Other gene clusters are involved in metabolism, transcription, cell growth and apoptosis, and nucleic acid and protein processing. The results suggest that PR-A and PR-B have different molecular functions and that it may be important to quantify either the PR isoform content of breast cancers or their gene targets, rather than total PR. The PR-positive T47Dco breast cancer cell line, isolation of its PR-negative clonal derivative T47D-Y, and construction of T47D-YA and T47D-YB cells have been described (36Horwitz K.B. Mockus M.B. Lessey B.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 633-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 37Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3668-3877PubMed Google Scholar). Cells are routinely cultured as described previously (38Richer J.K. Lange C.A. Manning N.G. Owen G. Powell R. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31317-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). T47D-YA and T47D-YB cells were grown to ∼70% confluence in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) with Earle's salts as described previously except without G418, washed with serum-free MEM, and changed into MEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum for 24 h, after which the cells were treated with 10 nmprogesterone dissolved in ethanol or with ethanol alone, for 6 or 12 h. Total RNA was prepared from the 4 sets of cells using guanidinium isothiocyanate; poly(A)+ RNA was purified with the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and32P-labeled cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of each sample using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Labeled probes were hybridized to AtlasTM Human cDNA Expression Array (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) nylon membranes onto which 588 cDNA fragments encoding known proteins are spotted in duplicate. After processing according to theCLONTECH User Manual (PT3140-1 PR91208), signals were detected by PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were analyzed using AtlasTM Image 1.0 (CLONTECH) and normalized to signals from control housekeeping genes on the same filter. For selected genes, progesterone inducibility and PR isoform specificity were confirmed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, and/or Western blotting as described below. T47D-Y, T47D-YA, and T47D-YB cells were grown to ∼70% confluence in MEM without antibiotic, washed with serum-free media, and changed into media containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 10 nm progesterone dissolved in ethanol, or in ethanol alone, for 6 h. Total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA were prepared from the 6 samples as described above. Poly(A)+ RNA was processed according to the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual (P/N 700218 rev2). Briefly, first strand and second strand cDNA syntheses were performed, and biotin-labeled cRNA was generated using the EnZo BioArrayTM High Yield Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed with RNeasy affinity columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified, biotinylated cRNAs were quantified, and 20 μg were subjected to a fragmentation reaction to randomly generate fragments ranging from 35 to 200 bases. HuGeneFL 6800 ArrayTM chips consisting of 5,600 full-length human genes from Unigene, GenBankTM, and TIGR data bases were used for hybridization. Thirty μl of fragmented cRNA were added to a hybridization mixture together with control oligonucleotide B2 and control cRNA mixture, then washed, and stained with streptavidin/phycoerythrin. DNA chips were read at a resolution of 6 μm with a Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner. The entire experiment was performed three separate times with PR-positive T47D-YA and T47D-YB cells and two separate times with PR-negative T47D-Y cells. Each repeat was separated by ∼1 month and was designed to be a true replicate taking into account experimental variability in cell culture conditions and sample preparation. To determine which progesterone-regulated genes are direct targets of PR, a separate experiment was performed in which T47D-YB cells were treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) 30 min before treatment with or without 10 nm progesterone. Cells were otherwise treated as described above, and RNA was derivatized and hybridized to microarray chips as above. Detailed protocols for data analyses of Affymetrix microarrays and extensive documentation of the sensitivity and quantitative aspects of the method have been described (39Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar). Briefly, MicroArray Suite 4.0 Expression Analysis ProgramTM (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) was used for the first level of analysis, including the “present” or “absent” call, and pairwise comparisons. Each gene on the chip is represented by perfectly matched (PM) and mismatched (MM) oligonucleotides from 16 to 20 regions of the gene. The number of instances in which the PM hybridization signal is larger than the MM signal is computed along with the average of the logarithm of the PM:MM ratio (after background subtraction) for each probe set. These values were used to arrive at a matrix-based decision concerning the presence or absence of an RNA transcript. The average difference serves as a relative indicator of the level of expression of a transcript and is used to determine the change in the hybridization intensity of a given probe set among different experiments. Multiple experimental (minusversus plus progesterone) pairwise comparisons were performed. In addition, multiple control comparisons (all minus hormone samples and all plus hormone samples) were performed to serve as a measure of the variability among samples. Finally, we compared fold change in “minus” versus “plus” hormone sets in PR-positive cells to fold change in PR-negative controls. The data were also analyzed using GeneSpringTM version 4.0 (Silicon Genetics, San Carlos, CA) to identify patterns of gene regulation in PR-A, PR-B, or PR-negative cells treated with or without progesterone. To normalize for staining intensity variations among chips, the average difference values for all genes on a given chip were divided by the median of all measurements on that chip. In addition, to scale the gene expression measurements so that they could be plotted on a reasonable y axis for visualization in GeneSpringTM 4.0, the average difference value for each individual gene was then normalized to itself by dividing all measurements for that gene by the mean of the expression values of the gene over all the samples. Normalized values below 0 were set to 0. Finally, to identify patterns of gene expression among cell lines and hormone treatments, k-means clustering was performed generating 24 clusters representing 53.8% explained variability. This generated clustergrams of genes regulated by progesterone in a PR isoform-dependent manner. However, because replicates were done for each cell line, additional statistical analyses were possible, and genes whose regulation was not statistically significant were discarded from the clusters. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance using a cut-off value of p< 0.05, followed by a Tukey multiple comparison test to determine whether the expression level in any individual cell line or hormone treatment was different from all other expression levels. The genes shown in the figures and listed in the tables were statistically significantly regulated by progesterone or, in the case of the ligand-independent effects, were significantly different in the presence versus the absence of PR. PCR amplifications included coamplification of internal controls, either β2-microglobulin (β2MG) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Control primers are as follows (where fwd is forward and rev is reverse): β2MG fwd, 5′-atccagcgtactccaaagattc-3′, and β2MG rev, 5′-tccttgctgaaagacaagtctg-3′ (178 bp); GAPDH fwd (447 bp), 5′-ccatgttcgtcatgggtgtgaacca-3′, or GAPDH fwd (633 bp), 5′-ggctctccagaacatcatccctgc-3′, and GAPDH rev (932 bp), 5′-gggtgtcgctgttgaagtcagagg-3′, to yield products of 485 or 299 bp. Other primers are as follows: HEF1 fwd, 5′-actgtcagcctccccagctcaggacaa-3′, HEF1 rev, 5′-atcgtcacacttgttctggggctt-3′; ERR fwd, 5′-ctgggtgtggcccagcgctcactg-3′, ERR rev, 5′gccagcccggccggcttcatactc-3′; MCP fwd, 5′-gatctcagtgcagaggctcg-3′, MCP rev, 5′-tgcttggtccaggtggtccat-3′; HSD11β2 fwd, 5′-catcgagcacttgcatgggcagtt-3′, HSD11β2 rev, 5′-ccaggctggccaggctgcagtgct-3′; BPAG fwd, 5′-gatgacaggaatttctagcctctac, BPAG rev, 5′-cacgcagttgaaggctgtgggaacg-3′; TF fwd, 5′-cacagagtgtgacctcaccgacgag-3′, TF rev, 5′-gtactcttccggttaactgttcgg-3′; integrin α6 fwd, 5′-cctgaggactgatttcagagtgactaca-3′, integrin α6 rev, 5′-tcttgtgatgtgggacagctaacgtgat-3′; BCL-X Lfwd, 5′-caggcgacgagtttgaactgcggtac-3′, BCL-XLrev, 5′aaggctctaggtggtcattcaggtaagt-3′; S100P fwd, 5′-gtgctgatggagaaggagctacca-3′, S100P rev 5′-taatcagaggtacatgagcaggct-3′; EZF fwd, 5′-ggcccaattacccatccttcctgc-3′, EZF rev, 5′-tgtgtaaggcgaggtggtccgacctgg-3′. All primers were designed to anneal at a temperature of 65 °C for specificity and to produce products between 200 and 600 nucleotides. Total RNA was prepared from cells treated with progesterone or ethanol vehicle for 3–48 h. One μg of total RNA was mixed with 0.4 μm random hexamers and heated to 65 °C for 5 min. 1× PCR buffer (5 mmMgCl2), 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 4 mmdNTPs, and 125 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were added, and tubes were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. Five μl of the cDNA synthesis reactions were added to 1× PCR buffer, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdNTP blend, and 60 pmol of specific primers were incubated with 5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 1 min for 16–18 cycles. Cycle numbers were determined to be in the linear range of amplification for each product by removal of 4 μl of product every 3 cycles, followed by densitometric quantification of each product over a 8–30 cycle range. (PCR reagents were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.) Five μl of products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel, and Southern blots were performed in 0.4 m NaOH. Blots were prehybridized in Rapid-Hyb (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 65 °C. cDNA probes were generated by RT-PCR and radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using MegaPrime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed for 2 h to overnight at 65 °C, washed, and exposed to autoradiography film or PhosphorImager screen. In some cases, RT-PCR products were visualized and quantitated directly on an ethidium bromide-stained gel. HeLa cells plated at 1 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum were transiently transfected by CaPO4coprecipitation with 100 ng of hPR1 (PR-B expression vector) or hPR2 (PR-A expression vector; gifts of Pierre Chambon, Strasbourg, France) and either 1.2 μg of the integrin α6 promoter (to −760 nucleotides) cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter (gift of Sohei Kitazawa, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan) or 1.2 μg of pA3(−1011/−1)BCL-XL-LUC construct (cloned as described below), 1.2 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110, and 5.5 μg of Bluescribe carrier plasmid. Cells were treated with 10 nm progesterone or ethanol vehicle. After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested in lysis solution, and 60 μl of lysate were analyzed for luciferase activity using the Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI) and a Monolight 2010 Luminometer, and relative luciferase units were corrected for transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase control. To clone the pA3(−1011/−1)BCL-X L -LUC, a human genomic library (CLONTECH catalog number HL1067J) was screened with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 246-bpBCL-X L 5′ PCR fragment. DNA was isolated from positive phage clones, and the BCL-X L promoter fragment was amplified by PCR using T7 and BCL-X L(5′-ttttataatagggatgggctcaa-3′) primers. The blunt-ended PCR product was subcloned into the pA3LUC vector (gift of William Wood, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO) and sequenced. Cells were plated at 1 million per 100-mm2 plates, treated with 10 nm progesterone for the times indicated, and harvested in RIPA buffer as described previously (38Richer J.K. Lange C.A. Manning N.G. Owen G. Powell R. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31317-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were equalized to 150 μg by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Equivalent protein loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Following incubation with the appropriate antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies,protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies were STAT5 C-17 (detects both STAT5A and 5B isoforms), p21 (C-18), C/EBPβ (Δ 198) (specific for LAP isoforms), and C/EBPβ (C-19) (detects both LAP and LIP isoforms), all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cdk1/ckc2 (PSTAIR). The anti-PR antibodies used, AB-52 and B-30, were from our laboratories. PR immunoblots show that the two stable cell lines, T47D-YA and T47D-YB, contain equal amounts of PR-A or PR-B, respectively, and each isoform is expressed at levels comparable with its levels in the parental T47Dco cells (Fig.1, left panel). These levels are half of the total PR in T47Dco. This was confirmed by ligand binding assays (not shown), in which the T47D-YA and T47D-YB cell extracts bind equivalent amounts of [3H]R5020, at half the levels bound by T47Dco cell extracts. In addition, 6 h of progesterone generates the expected ligand-dependent phosphorylation and down-regulation (40Lange C.A. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) of both isoforms (Fig. 1, right panel) in a manner identical to that seen with wild-type T47Dco cells (not shown). This important ligand-dependent receptor down-regulation is required for strong transcriptional activity by progesterone (41Shen T. Horwitz K.B. Lange C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To identify genes regulated by the two PR, replicate data points representing gene expression levels in T47D-YA or T47D-YB cells, and in PR-negative T47D-Y cells, treated with or without progesterone for 6 h, were analyzed by pairwise comparison. Genes that increased or decreased more than 1.8-fold in all three experiments and showed no significant variation among controls (PR negative cells, or triplicate “minus hormone” sets) were identified. Altogether, 94 genes of the 5,600 interrogated met these criteria (Table I). Fold changes are the average of triplicate experiments. In cases in which both receptors regulate the same gene, fold changes for each receptor are shown. Genes that were undetectable and called “absent” in one sample, but were detectable and called “present” in the other, are denoted with a tilde in Table I. (Note that the latter cannot be compared with fold changes for genes that were present in both samples, because the genes called absent were set to background levels.) All other genes represent ones that were present even in the absence of treatment but whose levels were altered by hormone. Genes indicated by Footnote a in Table I were identified with Atlas arrays; those indicated by Footnote c were identified using both Atlas and Affymetrix systems. All others were identified with the Affymetrix chips.Table IGenes regulated by progesteron"

https://openalex.org/W2062564388,"RNA granules are a macromolecular structure observed in neurons, where they serve as motile units that translocate mRNAs. Isolated RNA granules are highly enriched in Staufen protein and ultrastructurally contain densely packed clusters of ribosomes. With depolarization, many mRNAs, including those involved in plasticity, rapidly shift from the RNA granule fraction to polysomes. Depolarization reorganizes granules and induces a less compact organization of their ribosomes. RNA granules are not translationally competent, as indicated by the failure to incorporate radioactive amino acids and the absence of eIF4E, 4G, and tRNAs. We concluded that RNA granules are a local storage compartment for mRNAs under translational arrest but are poised for release to actively translated pools. Local release of mRNAs and ribosomes from granules may serve as a macromolecular mechanism linking RNA localization to translation and synaptic plasticity."

Fluorescence increases reflected activation of receptor neuron populations converging onto individual glomeruli. We report several findings. First, five glomeruli were identifiable across animals based on their location and odorant responsiveness; all five showed complex response specificities. Second, maps of input were chemotopically organized at near-threshold concentrations but, at moderate concentrations, involved many widely distributed glomeruli. Third, the dynamic range of input to a glomerulus was greater than that reported for individual receptor neurons. Finally, odorant activation slopes could differ across glomeruli, and for different odorants activating the same glomerulus. These results imply a high degree of complexity in odorant representations at the level of olfactory bulb input."

Functional sensitivity was increased by a factor of approximately 5 relative to the BOLD technique by injecting a contrast agent (monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticle [MION]). Areas identified as motion sensitive included V2, V3, MT/V5, vMST, FST, VIP, and FEF (with moving dots), as well as V4, TE, LIP, and PIP (with random lines). These regions sensitive for moving dots are largely in agreement with monkey single unit data and (except for V3A) with human fMRI results. Moving lines activate some regions that have not been previously implicated in motion processing. Overall, the results clarify the relationship between the motion pathway and the dorsal stream in primates."

To learn how such clocks influence behavioral and physiological rhythms, we determined the complement of circadian transcripts in adult Drosophila heads. High-density oligonucleotide arrays were used to collect data in the form of three 12-point time course experiments spanning a total of 6 days. Analyses of 24 hr Fourier components of the expression patterns revealed significant oscillations for ∼400 transcripts. Based on secondary filters and experimental verifications, a subset of 158 genes showed particularly robust cycling and many oscillatory phases. Circadian expression was associated with genes involved in diverse biological processes, including learning and memory/synapse function, vision, olfaction, locomotion, detoxification, and areas of metabolism. Data collected from three different clock mutants (per0, tim01, and ClkJrk), are consistent with both known and novel regulatory mechanisms controlling circadian transcription."

In many parietal and frontal cortical areas, activation increased with load over the entire range of loads tested, suggesting that these areas are directly involved in attentional processes. However, in other areas (FEF and parietal area 7), strong activation was observed even at the lowest attentional load (compared to a passive baseline using identical stimuli), but little or no additional activation was seen with increasing load. These latter areas appear to play a different role, perhaps supporting task-relevant functions that do not vary with load, such as the suppression of eye movements."
https://openalex.org/W2025189383,"Netrins are bifunctional guidance molecules, attracting some axons and repelling others. They act through receptors of the DCC and UNC5 families. DCC receptors have been implicated in both attraction and repulsion by Netrins. UNC5 receptors are required only for repulsion. In Drosophila, Netrins are expressed by midline cells of the CNS and by specific muscles in the periphery. They attract commissural and motor axons expressing the DCC family receptor Frazzled. Here we report the identification of the Drosophila Unc5 receptor, and show that it is a repulsive Netrin receptor likely to contribute to motor axon guidance. Ectopic expression of Unc5 on CNS axons can elicit either short- or long-range repulsion from the midline. Both short- and long-range repulsion require Netrin function, but only long-range repulsion requires Frazzled."

Here we show that cortical patterning involves regulation of the Lhx2 homeobox gene by the roof plate. Roof plate ablation results in reduced cortical size and Lhx2 expression defects that implicate roof plate signals in the bimodal regulation of Lhx2 in vivo. Bimodal Lhx2 regulation can be recapitulated in explants using two roof plate-derived signaling molecules, Bmp4 and Bmp2. Loss of Lhx2 function results in profound losses of cortical progenitors and neurons, but Lhx2 mutants continue to generate cortical neurons from dorsal sources that may include the roof plate region itself. These findings provide evidence for the roof plate as an organizing center of the developing cortex and for a roof plate-Lhx2 pathway in cortical patterning."

https://openalex.org/W2112033972,"Using a var2-2 mutant ofArabidopsis thaliana, which lacks a homologue of the zinc-metalloprotease, FtsH, we demonstrate that this protease is required for the efficient turnover of the D1 polypeptide of photosystem II and protection against photoinhibition in vivo. We show that var2-2 leaves are much more susceptible to light-induced photosystem II photoinhibition than wild-type leaves. Furthermore, the rate of photosystem II photoinhibition in untreated var2-2 leaves is equivalent to that of var2-2 and wild-type leaves, which have been treated with lincomycin, an inhibitor of the photosystem II repair cycle at the level of D1 synthesis. This is in contrast to untreated wild-type leaves, which show a much slower rate of photosystem II photoinhibition due to an efficient photosystem II repair cycle. The recovery of var2-2 leaves from photosystem II photoinhibition is also impaired relative to wild-type. Using Western blot analysis in the presence of lincomycin we show that the D1 polypeptide remains stable in leaves of the var2-2 mutant under photoinhibitory conditions that lead to D1 degradation in wild-type leaves and that the abundance of DegP2 is not affected by thevar2-2 mutation. We conclude, therefore, that the Var2 FtsH homologue is required for the cleavage of the D1 polypeptide in vivo. In addition, we identify a conserved lumenal domain in Var2 that is unique to FtsH homologues from oxygenic phototrophs.

At the core of PSII lies the D1/D2 heterodimer, which binds the pigments and co-factors necessary for primary photochemistry (1Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The D1 polypeptide is also important because of its high rate of turnover (2Mattoo A.K. Hoffman-Falk H. Marder J.B. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1380-1384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This high turnover rate is related to the vulnerability of PSII to light, with D1 being the main target for photoinactivation and subsequent damage. An efficient repair cycle for D1 is therefore of paramount importance in oxygenic phototrophs. When the rate of photoinactivation and damage of D1 exceeds the capacity for repair, photoinhibition occurs, resulting in a decrease in the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry. A key feature of the D1 repair cycle is the degradation of the damaged polypeptide. It is generally accepted that damaged D1 is initially cleaved at a site on the stromal loop between transmembrane helices D and E yielding a 23-kDa N-terminal fragment (3Greenberg B.M. Gaba V. Mattoo A.K. Edelman M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and a 10-kDa C-terminal fragment (4Canovas P.M. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This cleavage step is believed to be initiated by structural changes within the D1 polypeptide (5Jansen A.K. Depka B. Trebst A. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21246-21252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise nature of the cleavage event remains unclear. One proposal is that the action of active oxygen species acts to cleave the D1 polypeptide during strong illumination (6Miyao M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9722-9730Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the temperature dependence of the process (7Aro E.M. Hundal T. Carlberg I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 269-275Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and its sensitivity to protease inhibitors (8De Las Rivas J. Shipton C.A. Ponticos M. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6944-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) indicates the involvement of enzymatic proteolysis by an unidentified protease. Following cleavage, the breakdown fragments of D1 are rapidly degraded and the PSII complex reassembles with the co-translational integration of a newly synthesized polypeptide. Several proteases have been identified in photosynthetic organisms (reviewed in Ref. 9Adam Z. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and a number of studies have addressed the possibility that one or more may be involved in D1 turnover/assembly. One such protein is the stromal DegP2 protease, which has been shown to cleave D1 in in vitro assays (10Hauβühl K. Andersson B. Adamska I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Another protease implicated in D1 turnover, following in vitro analysis, is the thylakoid FtsH homologue, FtsH1 (11Lindahl M. Spetea C. Hundal T. Oppenheim A.B. Adam Z. Andersson B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis thaliana FtsH1 has been shown to degrade the 23-kDa breakdown product of D1 in isolated thylakoid membranes and purified PSII core complexes. Both studies are, however, limited in that the analysis was carried out in vitro, and the true in vivo role of both DegP2 and FtsH1 remains unclear. The FtsH protease belongs to the AAA (ATPasesassociated with a variety of cellularactivities) protein superfamily whose members are widely distributed among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They are involved in a number of diverse cellular functions, including organelle biosynthesis, transcriptional regulation, membrane fusion, and proteolysis (reviewed in Ref. 12Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All AAA family members are characterized by the presence of one or two highly conserved ATPase domains containing Walker A and B ATPase motifs. FtsH is further characterized by the presence of a zinc-metalloprotease motif (reviewed in Ref. 13Schumann W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ftsh gene was first identified in Escherichia coli (14Santos D. Almeida D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it encodes a 71-kDa polypeptide involved in various functions, including protein degradation (15Herman C. Ogura T. Tomoyasu T. Hiraga S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Thomas R. D'Ari R. Bouloc P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10861-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Tomayasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M.

FtsH-related homologues have also been implicated in protein degradation in eukaryotic organelles, for example in yeast mitochondria (17Weber E.R. Hanekamp T. Thorness P.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and, as mentioned, chloroplasts (11Lindahl M. Spetea C. Hundal T. Oppenheim A.B. Adam Z. Andersson B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 18Ostersetzer O. Adam Z. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated a role for FtsH in photosynthesis following the disruption of a gene encoding an FtsH homologue in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. The mutant strain, designated slr0228::Ω, was shown to be impaired in the maintenance of photosystem I (PSI), with levels decreased by 60% relative to wild-type (19Mann N.H. Novac N. Mullineaux C.W. Newman J. Bailey S. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the slr0228::Ω mutant shows enhanced PSII photoinhibition due to a decrease in the rate of D1 degradation. 2P. Silva and P. J. Nixon, personal communication.. The Slr0228 FtsH homologue of Synechocystis is closely related to Var2, a second homologue of FtsH that has recently been identified in Arabidopsis (20Chen M. Choi Y.-D. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant J. 2000; 22: 303-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Takechi K. Sodmergen Murata M. Motoyoshi F. Sakamoto W. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1334-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Mutations in the var2locus of Arabidopsis give rise to extensive leaf variegation due to impaired thylakoid membrane biogenesis. Green sectors in thevar2 mutants, however, contain morphologically normal chloroplasts despite lacking the Var2 homologue. This phenomenon gave us the opportunity to assess the involvement of Var2 in D1 turnover using in vivo assays of PSII photoinhibition and D1 degradation in whole leaves. In the present study we identify a unique conserved lumenal domain in Var2 that is not shared by Arabidopsis FtsH1 but is common to FtsH homologues from a diverse range of oxygenic phototrophs, including Slr0228 from Synechocystis. In addition we find that, in the absence of Var2, PSII photoinhibition is more extensive due to a critical role for the FtsH homologue in the primary cleavage of the D1 polypeptide. This report therefore identifies for the first time a chloroplast protease that is involved in vivo in the protection of plants from photoinhibition. Wild-type seeds of A. thaliana(L.) Heynh. cv. Columbia and the var2-2 mutant were grown under a long photoperiod (16 h light, 8 h dark). A growth irradiance of 100 μmol m−2 s−1 was provided by fluorescent tubes in a Fi-totron growth chamber, model 600G3/THTL (Fisons, Loughborough, UK). Temperature was maintained at 20 °C. Detached leaves were floated adaxial side up on water with the temperature regulated at 20 °C. Irradiance of either 300 or 1800 μmol m−2s−1 was provided through fiber optics fed via a Schott lamp (Schott Glass Ltd., Stafford, UK) and filtered for heat using a Calflex C filter. Chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis was blocked using lincomycin. Detached leaves were incubated with their petioles submersed in 1 mm solutions of lincomycin at an irradiance of 20 μmol m−2 s−1 for 3 h prior to photoinhibitory light treatment. The temperature was maintained at 20 °C during incubation. Room temperature chlorophyll fluorescence was measured using a PAM 101 fluorimeter (Heinz Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany). All measurements were made at 20 °C with saturating CO2. Photoinhibition was assayed by calculating the ratio of maximum to variable fluorescence (Fv/Fm) as a measure of the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII. In all experiments Fv/Fm was determined initially following dark adaptation overnight at ∼5 μmol m−2 s−1. Following photoinhibitory light treatment, either in the presence or absence of lincomycin, leaf disks were dark-adapted for 15 min prior to Fv/Fm measurement to allow for the relaxation of rapidly reversible fluorescence quenching components. The fast-relaxing, energy-dependent component of non-photochemical quenching, qE (22Thiele A. Winter K. Krause G.H. J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 151: 286-292Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the photochemical quenching parameter qP (23Van Kooten O. Snell J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) were calculated following 1 h of actinic illumination at either 300 or 1800 μmol m−2s−1 using the following equations,qE=(Fm/Fms)−(Fm/Fm′)Equation 1 qP=(Fm′−Fs)(Fm′−Fo′)Equation 2 where Fm is the dark-adapted maximum fluorescence yield, Fms is the quenched level of maximum fluorescence following illumination for 1 h, Fm′ is the maximum fluorescence yield after 10-min dark relaxation subsequent to 1-h illumination, Fs is the steady-state fluorescence yield in the light following 1 h illumination, and Fo′ is the steady-state fluorescence yield in the dark following 1-h illumination. Fluorescence spectra at 77 K were recorded using a LS50 luminescence spectrometer with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled, low temperature housing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Gaithersburg, MD). Excitation was at 435 nm (5-nm bandwidth), for chlorophyll a absorption. Spectra were measured over 600–750 nm (5-nm bandwidth) to reveal fluorescence emitted from PSII (at approximately 682 nm) and PSI (at approximately 732 nm). Approximately 20 mg of leaf tissue was ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen, then mixed to a homogenous frozen suspension with 5 ml of cold grinding buffer (0.33 m sorbitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) to ensure that there was no fluorescence re-absorption. The diluted plant tissue was then stored in liquid nitrogen in 4-mm silica tubes until used for recording spectra. Spectra were normalized to PSII fluorescence to allow comparison of mutant and wild-type plants. Chlorophyll was extracted from leaf disks by grinding in 80% (v/v) acetone or from thylakoids by diluting in 80% acetone. Following removal of leaf debris by centrifugation (1500 × g, 5 min), chlorophyll content was determined according to Porra et al. (24Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kreidemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 972: 163-170Google Scholar). For the preparation of thylakoids, leaves were homogenized in semi-frozen grinding media (0.33m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). The homogenized solution was filtered through four layers of muslin followed by two layers of muslin and one layer of cotton wool. The filtrate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of wash buffer (0.33 msorbitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) before being centrifuged at 4000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was then osmotically shocked by resuspension in 5 mm MgCl2 for at least 30 s before the addition of an equal volume of 0.66 msorbitol. Thylakoids were either used fresh or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. SDS-PAGE was carried out essentially according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), including 6 m urea in both the stacking and resolving gels. Solubilized thylakoids (1 μg of Chl equivalent or 30 μg of protein) were separated on a 15% (w/v) acrylamide gel and blotted onto Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., UK). D1 and D2 antisera were raised against synthetic peptides and were specific for the C terminus (26Dalla Chiesa M. Friso G. Deák Z. Vass I. Barber J. Nixon P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PsbS antisera were raised against purified protein from spinach (27Ljungberg U. Åkerlund H.-E. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). DegP2 antisera were raised against His-tagged DegP2 from A. thaliana overexpressed in Escherichia coli (10Hauβühl K. Andersson B. Adamska I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Bands were quantitated using TotalLab (NonLinear Dynamics Ltd.) software. The chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm measures the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry. It correlates with both the number of functional PSII reaction centers (28Öquist G. Chow W.S. Anderson J.M. Planta. 1992; 186: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and the quantum yield of light-induced O2 evolution (29Demmig B. Bjorkman O. Planta. 1987; 171: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and has, therefore, been extensively used as an in vivo measure of PSII photoinhibition. To test whether the var2-2 mutant is affected in terms of PSII photoinhibition we compared Fv/Fm in vivo, in detached leaves of wild-type Arabidopsis and the FtsH mutant var2-2. Fv/Fm values were measured during photoinhibitory irradiance (1800 μmol m−2s−1) in the presence or absence of lincomycin, which inhibits D1 synthesis and hence blocks the repair of damaged PSII (Fig. 1). In the absence of lincomycin, WT leaves showed an initial decrease in Fv/Fm to about 50% of the overnight dark-adapted values. After about 2 h there was no further decrease in Fv/Fm. In the presence of lincomycin the decrease in Fv/Fm in WT leaves was more rapid and continued until Fv/Fm values approached zero. Because D1 synthesis is inhibited in the presence of lincomycin, the rate of photoinhibition, as measured by the decrease in Fv/Fm, reflects the rate of PSII photoinactivation. When Fv/Fm was monitored in the var2-2 mutant in the presence of lincomycin, during the same photoinhibitory light treatment, the decrease was similar to that of wild-type leaves in the presence of lincomycin, suggesting that both wild-type and var2-2 leaves have the same rate of PSII photoinactivation. In addition, the decrease in Fv/Fm values in var2-2 leaves during photoinhibition in the absence of lincomycin also proceeded with the same rapid kinetics as lincomycin-treated WT and var2-2 leaves, strongly suggesting that the D1 repair cycle is impaired invar2-2. To further characterize the susceptibility of var2-2 leaves to PSII photoinhibition and to assess the capacity for recovery from photoinhibition, Fv/Fm values were monitored in wild-type andvar2-2 leaves following treatment with both moderate (300 μmol m−2 s−1) and high (1800 μmol m−2 s−1) irradiance, and during the subsequent dark recovery period. As shown in Fig.2, following 1 h of illumination at 300 μmol m−2 s−1 the wild-type leaves maintained the same high values of Fv/Fm recorded after overnight dark adaptation (time −60 min), whereas var2-2 leaves showed a decrease in Fv/Fm from 0.695 to below 0.5. One hour of illumination at 1800 μmol m−2 s−1 resulted in a decrease in Fv/Fm in wild-type leaves from 0.8 to just below 0.6, indicating photoinhibition under these high light conditions as expected. However, var2-2 levels decreased from 0.73 to 0.32 during the same period of irradiance clearly demonstrating enhanced photoinhibition in var2-2 leaves relative to wild-type. In addition, the recovery from photoinhibition was much slower invar2-2 leaves when compared with wild-type. Fv/Fm values, measured in wild-type leaves dark-adapted overnight (unattached during dark adaptation), have high values of above 0.8 (time 0).var2-2 leave, on the other hand, failed to reach the high values of Fv/Fm expected for leaves dark-adapted for this period of time. Furthermore, following 1-h irradiance at 1800 μmol m−2 s−1 WT leaves showed clear increases in Fv/Fm during the first 6 h of the subsequent dark recovery period. After 20 h the wild-type leaves had almost reached the same high values of Fv/Fm recorded after overnight dark adaptation. In contrastvar2-2 leaves showed no sign of recovery in the first 6 h following illumination at either 300 or 1800 μmol m−2s−1, and although there was some recovery after 20 h this failed to restore the Fv/Fm values to those measured following overnight dark adaptation. We have compared a number of photosynthetic characteristics that may potentially contribute to PSII photoinhibition in var2-2 and wild-type leaves. The ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b (Chla/b) has been shown to correlate well with both the size of the PSII light-harvesting antenna and the level of thylakoid membrane stacking (30Leong T.Y. Anderson J.M. Photosynth. Res. 1984; 5: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the susceptibility of PSII to photoinhibition has been correlated with Chl a/b (31Aro E.M. McCaffrey S. Anderson J.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). TableI shows values of Chla/b for var2-2 and WT leaves ofArabidopsis. Both values are equivalent and are consistent with a large PSII antenna following growth at low irradiance.Table IPhotosynthetic characteristics of wild type and var2-2Chla/bqEqPModerate irradianceHigh irradianceModerate irradianceHigh irradianceWild-type2.93 ± 0.090.95 ± 0.042.15 ± 0.110.32 ± 0.040.06 ± 0.02yar2–22.97 ± 1.120.52 ± 0.071.25 ± 0.180.04 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab Although the Chl a/b ratio is equivalent in bothvar2-2 and wild-type leaves, it is possible that light energy absorbed by PSII can be redistributed to PSI following migration of LHCII, the PSII light-harvesting antenna (32Horton P. Black M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Low temperature (77 K) fluorescence spectra were recorded to examine the distribution of excitation energy in var2-2 and wild-type leaves ofArabidopsis (Fig. 3). These indicate that the ratio of PSII emission (688–699 nm) and PSI emission (733–734 nm) are similar for both WT and mutant, suggesting an equivalent distribution of excitation energy. The capacity for xanthophyll cycle-related, energy-dependent dissipation of excess absorbed energy is termed qE (reviewed in Ref. 33Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref Scopus (1421) Google Scholar), Table I shows qE values for both wild-type and var2-2 leaves following exposure to both moderate (300 μmol m−2 s−1) and high (1800 μmol m−2 s−1) irradiance. Following exposure to both sets of irradiance the capacity for qE is approximately half the wild-type levels in var2-2. In addition, the capacity for photochemical quenching of absorbed light energy is also lower than that of wild-type in var2-2following exposure to the same two irradiance (Table I). The more commonly used approach to study D1 turnover is pulse labeling with [35S]methionine. We initially attempted to carry out such studies but found that var2-2 mutant leaves labeled very much more slowly than the wild-type and that a greatly extended (>4×) labeling period was needed to obtain D1 signals comparable to the wild-type. This in itself is consistent with impaired D1 turnover. Mutant leaves are sickly, and following incubation periods sufficient to label D1, the leaf material has degenerated to the point where a chase is no longer technically possible. Therefore, we elected to adopt a Western blotting approach. The ability to degrade the D1 polypeptidein vivo following light-induced damage was assayed in wild-type and var2-2 leaves using Western blot analysis in the absence and presence of lincomycin. Because D1 synthesis is inhibited following lincomycin treatment the degradation of existing D1 results in a decrease in polypeptide content relative to untreated leaves. As shown in Fig. 4Athe D1 polypeptide was decreased by 32% relative to untreated leaves in wild-type leaves following 3-h treatment with lincomycin at low irradiance (20 μmol m−2 s−1). After 2-h subsequent exposure to photoinhibitory irradiance, the remaining D1 polypeptide was reduced by 66% in wild-type leaves. In contrast, the D1 polypeptide showed no decrease in the var2-2 mutant following exposure to photoinhibitory irradiance (1800 μmol m−2 s−1) in the presence of lincomycin, despite a 28% loss of D1 following the initial treatment with lincomycin at low light. When the same experiment was performed in wild-type leaves in the absence of lincomycin treatment (Fig.4B) there was no loss of the D1 polypeptide throughout, suggesting that D1 degradation is matched by synthesis, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the lincomycin treatment. Western blot analysis using antibody specific to the other PSII core polypeptide, D2, was also carried out following the same treatment of leaves as described for D1. Again there were losses in the D2 polypeptide in wild-type leaves following lincomycin treatment at low light and more dramatically following exposure to photoinhibitory irradiance. These losses are not, however, as marked as those observed for the D1 polypeptide. As with D1 the D2 polypeptide remained stable following exposure of var2-2 leaves to photoinhibitory irradiance despite an initial loss following lincomycin treatment at low light. To demonstrate that the turnover of the core PSII polypeptides represents specific degradation and not just destabilization of the photosynthetic apparatus, the content of the minor PSII polypeptide, PsbS, was assayed following lincomycin and photoinhibitory light treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A the PsbS polypeptide content remains unchanged throughout in both wild-type and var2-2leaves. However, it is interesting to note that the PsbS levels in untreated var2-2 leaves are lower than those of wild-type, and this observation may account for the lower values of qE for the mutant as has been shown for a psbS mutant ofArabidopsis (34Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The thylakoid protease DegP2 has already been implicated in D1 turnover (10Hauβühl K. Andersson B. Adamska I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To establish whether the effect of the var2-2 mutation was indirectly affecting D1 turnover via a reduction of DegP2 a Western blot was carried out on thylakoid proteins from the wild-type and var2-2 mutant with anti-DegP2 antibodies. No reduction in the abundance of DegP2 was observed in the var2-2 mutant (Fig. 4C). To investigate the relationship between FtsH homologues from photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms the amino acid sequences from Arabidopsis FtsH1 and Var2 were aligned with FtsH sequences from Synechocystis PCC 6803 and the E. coli FtsH using the MACAW program, which employs the segment pair overlap method to detect small regions of similarity between sequences. This alignment revealed that Var2 and the Slr0228 FtsH homologue fromSynechocystis contain a conserved 81-amino acid sequence feature that is not present in FtsH1, E. coli FtsH, or any other Synechocystis FtsH homologue. Further analysis of Slr0228 using the TMHMM (version 2.0) program to predict transmembrane helices revealed that this 81-amino acid feature lay between two very strongly predicted transmembrane helices running from residues 15–37 and 115–137. Given the predicted orientation of these helices and assuming that Slr0228 is located in the thylakoid membrane, the conserved 81-amino acid feature would constitute a lumenal domain. Var2 is already known to be localized to the thylakoid membrane (20Chen M. Choi Y.-D. Voytas D.F. Rodermel S. Plant J. 2000; 22: 303-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the sequence of the putative conserved 81-amino acid lumenal domain from Slr0228 was used to do a protein-protein BLAST search of the NCBI non-redundant data base, a number of sequences were returned, all of which shared extensive similarity (Fig.5). Interestingly, all of the sequences were exclusively FtsH homologues from oxygenic phototrophs. We propose that this 81-amino acid conserved lumenal (CL) domain represents a key identifies a sub-family of FtsH homologues whose members are restricted to oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Two further members of this sub-family are encoded on chromosomes 1 and 5 of A. thalianaindicating the existence of a multigene family. As part of a PSII repair cycle, damaged D1 polypeptides may be rapidly degraded and replaced by newly synthesized polypeptides (reviewed in Ref. 35Aro E.M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). This repair cycle is of great importance to oxygenic phototrophs because when the rate of photoinactivation and damage of D1 exceeds the capacity for repair, photoinhibition occurs, resulting in a decrease in the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry. This may ultimately affect the viability of the whole organism. Despite intensive research, the mechanism of D1 degradation has remained largely uncharacterized. Analysis in vitroindicates that a stromal DegP type protease is capable of performing the initial cleavage of D1 (10Hauβühl K. Andersson B. Adamska I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); however, the role of DegP2 in D1 turnover in vivo remains unclear. In contrast, the in vivo analysis of photoinhibition and D1 degradation presented here suggests that a thylakoid FtsH homologue is required for this initial cleavage step. Using the Arabidopsis var2-2 mutant, which has a mis-sense mutation at the end of the second transmembrane domain and fails to accumulate the Var2 FtsH homologue in the membrane, we have shown that PSII is more susceptible to photoinhibition in the absence of this protease (Fig. 2). Treatment with either moderate or high irradiance resulted in considerably greater PSII photoinhibition (decreased Fv/Fm) in var2-2 leaves compared with wild-type. Indeed var2-2 showed high levels of PSII photoinhibition following exposure to an irradiance that failed to induce photoinhibition in wild-type leaves. A number of factors may account for this enhanced susceptibility of PSII to photoinhibition. These include greater PSII antenna size and thylakoid membrane stacking (31Aro E.M. McCaffrey S. Anderson J.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), decreased capacity for energy-dependent quenching of absorbed photons (36Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. 1992; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2081) Google Scholar) and enhanced PSII excitation pressure (37Huner N.P.A. Öquist G. Sarhan F. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (810) Google Scholar), all of which can be measured as Chl a/b ratio, qE and qP, respectively. However, the Chl a/bratios of both wild-type and var2-2 leaves are essentially the same (Table I), and, although var2-2 leaves do show decreased levels of qE formation and lower values of qP following light treatment (Table I), the rate of PSII photoinactivation in the presence of lincomycin is the same as wild-type (Fig. 1). We suggest therefore that an impaired PSII repair cycle forms the basis of the enhanced sensitivity of PSII to photoinhibition in the var2-2 mutant. Dark relaxation of Fv/Fm following light treatment is slower invar2-2 leaves than wild-type (Fig. 2). In addition, the kinetics of formation of photoinhibition in untreated var2-2leaves are identical to wild-type leaves, which have been treated with lincomycin and therefore are unable to carry out D1 repair (Fig. 1). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that the D1 repair cycle is diminished in the absence of Var2. Western blot analysis of the D1 polypeptide following lincomycin and high-light treatment provides direct evidence for decreased turnover of D1 in thevar2-2 mutant (Fig. 4). The stability of the 32-kDa polypeptide in var2-2 suggests that the Var2 FtsH homologue may be involved in the initial cleavage step of photo-damaged D1 polypeptides. Furthermore, the PSII core polypeptide, D2, which is also known to undergo damage and repair under photoinhibitory irradiance (38Schuster G. Timberg R. Ohad I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), also remains stable in the var2-2 mutant following treatment with lincomycin and high light (Fig. 4). This is in contrast to wild-type leaves, which show a marked decrease in D2 polypeptide content. The exact nature of the involvement of FtsH in the repair cycle of PSII is unclear, but it seems likely that the protease is directly involved in D1 turnover in vivo. The possibility of an indirect effect via DegP2 has been excluded (Fig. 4C). Other possibilities for the involvement of Var2 in D1 turnover exist, including a possible role in determining the phosphorylation state of D1, because it has been proposed that phosphorylated D1 remains stable (39Rintamaki E. Kettunen R. Aro E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14870-14875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Var2 may also have a direct role in D2 turnover, although it is possible that the degradation of D2 requires prior degradation of D1 and that another thylakoid protease may be involved in D2 turnover. Such a suggestion relating to the connectivity of regulation between D1 and D2 has previously been made (40Jansen M.A.K. Greenberg B.M. Edelman M. Mattoo A.K. Gaba V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 814-817Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indeed, the possibility that a number of proteases, particularly FtsH proteases, may also perform D1 degradation in vivo cannot be ruled out. Photoinactivation and damage of the D1 polypeptide are known to proceed by at least two separate mechanisms, namely donor and acceptor side photoinhibition (reviewed in Ref. 41Long S.P. Humphries S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1994; 45: 633-662Crossref Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), which give rise to distinct breakdown products. Data base analysis suggests that A. thaliana contains at least five homologues of FtsH. An involvement of these proteases during D1 degradation via multiple pathways is likely. Such an overlap in function of the various FtsH homologues, and possibly other thylakoid proteases, could account for our observation that both the D1 and D2 polypeptides undergo some degradation in the presence of lincomycin at low light (Fig. 4A). Our data showing that FtsH homologues are required for the initial cleavage of the D1 polypeptide are strengthened by the finding that thevar2-2 phenotype with respect to D1 turnover is also mirrored in the slr0228::Ω mutant ofSynechocystis, which lacks one of four FtsH homologues encoded in the genome.2 The sequence analysis presented here also reveals that Var2 and the Slr0228 FtsH homologue share another feature in common; the conserved lumenal domain (Fig. 5). This domain is exclusive to FtsH-like proteins from oxygenic phototrophs. We propose that this domain identifies a sub-family of FtsH homologues restricted to and essential for oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. The discovery of this domain may represent a significant step forward in our understanding of the specificity and regulation of FtsH homologues. In conclusion we have demonstrated that the Var2 FtsH homologue ofArabidopsis is required for the protection of PSII from photoinhibition in vivo via a role in the efficient turnover of the PSII core polypeptides, D1 and D2. We are grateful to Drs. I. Adamska and C. Funk for the kind gifts of the DegP2 and PsbS antisera, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2151525286,"In voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv), an intracellular gate regulates access from the cytoplasm to the pore by organic channel blockers and by chemical modifiers. But is ion flow itself controlled instead by constriction of the narrow selectivity filter near the extracellular surface? We find that the intracellular gate of Kv channels is capable of regulating access even by the small cations Cd2+ and Ag+. It can also exclude small neutral or negatively charged molecules, indicating that the gate operates by steric exclusion rather than electrostatically. Just intracellular to the gated region, channel closure does not restrict access even to very large reagents. Either these Kv channels have a broader inner entrance than seen in the KcsA crystal, even in the closed state, or the region is highly flexible (but nevertheless remains very securely closed nearby)."

Here, we report the purification and characterization of the human Elongator complex. Our results reveal extensive structural and functional similarity between the yeast and the human complex. Most notably, human holo-Elongator is a histone acetyltransferase complex, which in addition to human ELP3 (hELP3) contains IKAP, human StIP1, human ELP4 (hELP4), and two additional proteins as subunits. The identification of IKAP as an Elongator subunit suggests a connection between Elongator and human disease. Buffers A, B, and C were as described previously (13Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23383-23387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that KCl was used as salt in buffers A and B. Buffer D was 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and the concentration of KCl indicated after the hyphen. Protease inhibitors were included in all buffers used (14Flanagan P.M. Kelleher R.J. Feaver W.J. Lue N.F. LaPointe J.W. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11105-11107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout purification, Elongator was followed by Western blotting using anti-IKAP (15Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S.

Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22749-22757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) until after the ultracentrifugation step. The soluble cell extract was then dialyzed into buffer B-50 (50 mm KCl), loaded onto heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and eluted stepwise with buffer B-150, B-300, B-450, and B-700. Proteins from the B-300 eluate were loaded onto HTP hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad), equilibrated in buffer C-10, and eluted with a gradient from 10 to 400 mm potassium phosphate over 10 column volumes (CV) in buffer C. Elongator-containing fractions were dialyzed into buffer A-50, loaded onto a MonoS HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a linear gradient from 70 to 800 mm salt in buffer A over 15 CV. Fractions containing Elongator were pooled, dialyzed into buffer B-50, loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B-50, and eluted with a linear gradient from 70 to 500 mm salt in buffer B over 10 CV. Elongator fractions were loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 (26/20) gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in buffer B-150, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The Elongator-containing fractions were diluted, applied to Progel-TSK DEAE-5PW (Supelco) equilibrated in buffer B-50, and eluted with a linear gradient from 70 to 800 mm salt in buffer B over 10 CV. Elongator fractions were loaded onto HTP hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad), and the resin was resolved as described above. The purity of the fractions from hydroxyapatite was determined by silver staining. In addition to some of the steps described, the procedure to purify holo-Elongator utilized DEAE-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), with proteins eluted stepwise in buffer B containing 150, 300, 450, and 700 mm salt. Proteins in the B-300 eluate were precipitated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (40% saturation) before dialysis into buffer A-50 and MonoS HR5/5 chromatography as described above. Elongator fractions were incubated with IKAP antibody resin for several hours to overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Following washing with B-100, antibody-associated proteins were released by batch incubation with 1 CV of 1 mg/ml IKAP peptide (15Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S. Li J. Klippel A. Giese K. Baeuerle P.A. Scheidereit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29779-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in buffer D-500 at 4 °C for several hours and eluted from the resin by gravity flow. Gel-fractionated proteins were digested with trypsin, and peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight MS and by electrospray ionization MS/MS as previously described (7Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Selected mass values from the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight experiments were taken to search the protein nonredundant data base (NCBI, Bethesda, MD) using the PeptideSearch (17Mann M. Hojrup P. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1993; 22: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) algorithm. MS/MS spectra were inspected for y“ ion series to compare with the computer-generated fragment ion series of the predicted tryptic peptides. 15-μl reactions were carried out in HAT buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol), using 0.25 μCi of [3H]acetyl-coenzyme A (4.6 Ci/mmol, 250 μCi/ml) per assay and 5 μg of core histones where indicated. Core histones were prepared from HeLa cells as described (18Coté J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Genet. 1995; 6: 108-128Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Histone tail peptides, mimicking the last 25–30 amino acids of the respective tails (3 μg), were also used. HAT reactions were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. Reactions were analyzed by scintillation counting or fluorography. For visualization by autoradiography, the reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE using 16.5% Tris-HCl peptide gels (Bio-Rad). After staining of the histones by Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the gels were soaked in Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and subjected to fluorography for 2–14 days. For expression in insect Sf9 cells, the hELP3 coding region was cloned into theKpnI-XbaI sites of pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen). Details of the clone are available on request. Virus production and protein expression in insect Sf9 cells were done according to instructions from the manufacturer. Extracts from cells containing hELP3 virus were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min. hELP3 protein was recovered from the insoluble fraction by redissolving in SDS gel loading buffer without reducing agent. To produce anti-hELP4 antibodies, a peptide encompassing the last 20 amino acids of the hELP4 protein was synthesized. This peptide was coupled via glutaraldehyde cross-linking to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem) and used to immunize rabbits (Murex). For immunoblotting, the anti-hELP4 antibody was used at a final dilution of 1:1000, and the anti-IKAP, anti-Elp3, and anti-RNAPII (8WG16) antibodies were used at 1:2500 in 0.01% Tween, 5% milk phosphate-buffered saline. To produce an IKAP antibody affinity column, IKAP antibodies (15Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S. Li J. Klippel A. Giese K. Baeuerle P.A. Scheidereit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29779-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were coupled to protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) using standard chemical coupling with sodium borate, pH 9.0, dimethylpimedilate, and ethanolamine (19Lane D. Harlow E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The IKAP beads were equilibrated in buffer D-100 prior to use. Proteins were eluted with a peptide mimicking the C terminus of IKAP (15Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S. Li J. Klippel A. Giese K. Baeuerle P.A. Scheidereit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29779-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The presence of Elongator in elongation complexes was studied using anti-IKAP antibodies, and G11 early elongation complexes were generated as described (20Lehman A.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14923-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For studies of Elongator-RNAPII interaction in solution, equal amounts of virtually homogenous calf thymus RNA polymerase II (22Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified human Elongator (200-ng hydroxyapatite fraction) in 50 mm Tris-acetate, pH 7.8, 2% glycerol, 0.15m NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol were mixed in a final volume of 50 μl on ice. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C prior to loading onto Superose 6 PC3.2/30 (Amersham Biosciences). Human Elongator interacted with both RNAPII-A and RNAPII-0. Experiments to determine the subnuclear localization of IKAP and hELP3 were carried out on normal culture HeLa cells using the method described by Osborne et al. (23Osborne S.L. Herreros J. Bastiaens P.I. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 59-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with primary antibody dilutions of 1:700 and the Alexa 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) used at 1:200. We identified, cloned, and sequenced the hELP3 gene. It also recently appeared in the human genome data base as hypothetical protein AAH01240 (g12654795). Like other metazoan Elp3 homologues (6Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), hELP3 is highly homologous to the yeast counterpart (77% identity, 82% similarity) over the entire coding region. Antibodies directed against yeast Elp3 recognized recombinant hELP3 protein isolated from Sf9 insect cells as well as a protein of the expected size in HeLa whole cell extracts (Fig.1A and data not shown). Combined use of anti-Elp3 antibodies and antibodies against IKAP (15Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S. Li J. Klippel A. Giese K. Baeuerle P.A. Scheidereit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29779-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the closest human homologue of Elp1, made it clear that IKAP and hELP3 protein co-purified during chromatography on a variety of resins, although IKAP could also be detected in fractions that did not contain significant amounts of hELP3 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Immunoprecipitation using anti-IKAP antibodies co-depleted similar proportions of total IKAP and hELP3 protein (Fig. 1B,lanes 1 and 2), and both proteins could be eluted from the affinity resin with the IKAP peptide used to raise the antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 3, and Fig. 4A). Immunoprecipitation with beads alone did not bring down any of the proteins (data not shown). Based on these observations, we concluded that IKAP and hELP3 are associated in a human Elongator complex, and we next purified the complex to virtual homogeneity. Fig. 1C shows the most highly purified Elongator fraction from the final hydoxylapatite column. This procedure yielded a three-subunit complex, in which IKAP, hELP3, and a 95-kDa protein are indicated. We designate this complex human core Elongator.Figure 4Purification of holo-Elongator and HATactivity of the highly purified factor.A, purification procedure (left panel) and the holo-Elongator fraction (right panel) after elution from the antibody resin. Migration of size markers is indicated on theleft, and the proteins are designated on theright. B, HAT activity of holo-Elongator. The holo-Elongator complex and conventionally purified core Elongator were titrated into the HAT assay. The resulting fluorogram (upper panel) and the Coomassie-stained histone gel (middle panel) as well as a Western blot indicating the relative amounts of IKAP, hELP3, and hELP4 used in the assays (lower panel) are shown. Several independent experiments failed to detect HAT activity in core Elongator fractions from several independent purifications, even after very long fluorogram exposures. C, Elongator HAT activity is directed against the tails of histones H3 and H4. Peptides mimicking the indicated histone tails were used in HAT assays in the absence (white bars) or presence (filled bars) of holo-Elongator and quantitated by scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In yeast, Elongator is the major component of native elongating RNAPII holoenzyme, and the Elongator-RNAPII interaction can be reconstituted with purified proteins (4Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We tested if Elongator is a component of early elongation complexes (EECs) formed by incubating bead-immobilized DNA templates containing the adenovirus 2 major late promoter with HeLa nuclear extract under conditions that allow RNAPII to transcribe 11 nucleotides before pausing due to limiting amounts of CTP (20Lehman A.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14923-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The beads containing the early elongation complexes were first washed under mild conditions and then stringently with 1% sarcosyl (Fig.2A). Hyperphosphorylated RNAPII was detected on the beads after both washes (lanes 4 and 5), although the majority was found in the supernatant after the sarcosyl wash (compare lanes 1 and 4). Elongator could not be detected after sarcosyl treatment (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 5) but was detected on the beads after the salt wash, suggesting that it associates with EECs. The IKAP signal detected in EECs washed only with salt is stable up to and including rinse with 600 mm KCl. Sarkosyl treatment removes most proteins from DNA, and EECs treated with Sarcosyl contain equimolar amounts of transcript and RNAP II, indicating that Sarkosyl efficiently and selectively dissociates nontranscribing RNAP II (20Lehman A.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14923-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Significantly, we found that purified Elongator was able to associate with sarcosyl-washed EECs (Fig.2B). Some association with DNA-beads alone was also observed although clearly to a lesser extent than with EECs (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 3 withlanes 5 and 6), indicating that Elongator may also have an intrinsic ability to bind DNA. We finally investigated whether a mammalian RNAPII-Elongator holoenzyme could be reconstituted from RNAPII and Elongator in the absence of nucleic acids. Highly purified RNAPII and core Elongator were analyzed by gel filtration (Fig. 2C), either individually (two upper panels) or after mixing (lower panel). Mammalian RNAPII and Elongator formed a complex in vitro, as evidenced by the mobility shift of these proteins from the position they occupied when run as separate entities to that of a novel species. As previously observed with the yeast counterparts (4Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), a fraction of RNAPII eluted in earlier fractions, while Elongator was quantitatively shifted to elute in later fractions by the association. Collectively, these results indicate that the Elongator HAT complex has the intrinsic ability to associate directly with RNAPII in elongation complexes, suggesting a role for the complex during transcription in human cells. Elongator localization was determined by immunostaining (Fig.3). As expected, both IKAP and hELP3 were found predominantly in the cell nucleus. Unexpectedly, however, significant fractions of the proteins localized to the nucleoli and both IKAP and hELP3 could also be detected in the cytoplasm. As previously observed in the case of yeast Elongator (7Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), immunoblotting of human Elongator fractions showed that hELP4, the human homologue of yeast Elp4 (7Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), did not co-elute precisely with the peak of IKAP and hELP3 during MonoQ chromatography (Fig. 1D). Moreover, when the HAT activity of the eluted fractions was measured (Fig.1D, lower panel), little or no HAT activity co-eluted with the peak of Elongator in MonoQ fractions 30–32. By contrast, low but significant levels of H3 and H4 HAT activity were detected in fractions 27–29, the leading edge of the Elongator elution profile. This activity thus co-eluted with the hELP4 protein. These data might suggest that the human Elongator complex is unstable and that the hELP4-containing fractions represent an active form of human Elongator complex remaining after several columns of purification. Such a chromatographic behavior would be strikingly similar to that of yeast Elongator, which can dissociate into two three-subunit subcomplexes during purification (7Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to design an alternative procedure to purify the intact complex by taking advantage of an anti-IKAP immunoaffinity step (Fig.4). When the purification procedure that took advantage of affinity chromatography was employed, the subunit composition of human Elongator complex differed significantly from the core complex purified by conventional means (Fig. 4A). We designate this complex human holo-Elongator. The virtually homogenous, immunopurified complex was compared with core Elongator complex in HAT assays. Holo-Elongator had robust HAT activity directed against histone H3 and H4, whereas similar quantities of core Elongator had no activity (Fig.4B), indicating that the additional subunits confer HAT activity to the holo-Elongator complex. As expected, the activity of holo-Elongator was directed against the tails of histone H3 and H4 (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the three small holo-Elongator subunits, hELP4, p38, and p30, are required to activate the HAT activity of hELP3 or that one of these proteins has intrinsic HAT activity. Four of the subunits of holo-Elongator were identified by a combination of peptide mass fingerprinting and mass spectrometric sequencing. In this way, the presence of IKAP, hELP3, and hELP4 in human holo-Elongator was confirmed. Moreover, the 95-kDa protein, which was also observed in core Elongator (p95; Fig. 1C), was identified as hypothetical protein BAB14193 (NCBI g10434263), a conserved WD40 repeat protein that is the human homologue of yeast Elp2 and mouse StIP1 (10Collum R.G. Brutsaert S. Lee G. Schindler C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10120-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Interestingly, data base searching for protein motifs in hELP2 revealed the presence of a motif (signature 2 motif) found repeated several times in the regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) protein. RCC1 has recently been shown to bind to chromatin via association with histones (24Nemergut M.E. Mizzen C.A. Stukenberg T. Allis C.D. Macara I.G. Science. 2001; 292: 1540-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but whether this requires the signature 2 motif is not known. We conclude that the components of the Elongator complex are well conserved from yeast to humans. In this report, we describe the purification and characterization of human Elongator. We find that human Elongator is remarkably similar to the yeast complex on several levels. First, it consists of homologues of the yeast Elp proteins. We have so far identified human homologues of yeast Elp1, Elp2, Elp3, and Elp4 in the holocomplex, which, like the yeast counterpart, appears to consist of six subunits. The p38 and p30 subunit of the human complex might be encoded by homologues of yeast Elp5 and Elp6. Second, as in yeast, human Elongator complex appears to exist as a core, three-subunit complex (hELP1/IKAP, hELP2, and hELP3) or as a larger, six-subunit holo-Elongator complex. In all likelihood, the human holo-Elongator complex dissociates during purification, at least partly as a consequence of treatment with high salt and MonoQ chromatography, as has previously been demonstrated for the yeast complex (7Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Third, human holo-Elongator complex has histone H3 and H4 HAT activity, which has also been observed for the yeast holocomplex. 2G. S. Winkler, and J. Q. Svejstrup, unpublished results. Finally, human Elongator complex has the ability to associate with RNAPII both in solution and in elongation complexes. Based on these results, we suggest that human Elongator complex serves a role in RNAPII-associated chromatin remodeling during transcript elongation in higher cells. Significantly, we found that only holo-Elongator complex has detectable HAT activity, indicating that the additional components (hELP4, p38, and p30) confer activity to the hELP3 catalytic subunit present in the catalytically inactive core Elongator complex or that one of the additional components itself has HAT activity. We favor the former possibility, because similar results have been found for yeast Elongator complex. Neither yeast Elp4, Elp5, nor Elp6 contain motifs with homology to known HATs, and the complex of these proteins has no HAT activity in itself but confers activity to Elp3 in the core Elongator complex.2 The largest subunit of human Elongator is encoded by the IKAP gene. This protein was originally isolated biochemically as a subunit of a large complex containing IκB kinases and proposed to be a scaffold protein for the assembly of these proteins (9Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, IKAP is the closest human homologue of yeast Elp1 with regions of high similarity spread over the entire coding region (4Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M.

Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and recent data seriously question the proposed role of IKAP in IκB kinase signaling (15Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S.

Thus, IKAP exists in a complex of the size expected for Elongator and immunoprecipitation of the protein from crude extracts yields a 5–7-subunit complex (15Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29779-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) of a composition similar to the holo-Elongator complex presented here. Importantly, this immunoprecipitated IKAP complex does not include IκB kinases, and the IκB kinase complex still forms and is activated normally in cells where IKAP mRNA and protein levels are reduced to very low levels by antisense oligonucleotides (15Krappmann D.

Finally, overexpression of IKAP blocks not only induction of a NF-κB-dependent reporter gene but also transcription from several NF-κB-independent promoters (15Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Tegethoff S.

Taken together, the data thus suggest that IKAP is not involved in IκB kinase signaling but rather plays a role in RNAPII transcription as a component of Elongator. A splicing site mutation in the gene encoding IKAP causes the severe human recessive disorder, familial dysautonomia (11Anderson S.L. Coli R. Daly I.W. Kichula E.A. Rork M.J. Volpi S.A. Ekstein J.

This mutation leads to the tissue-dependent expression of a truncated version of the IKAP protein, which results in the poor development, survival, and progressive degeneration of the sensory and autonomic nervous system. The disorder is invariably fatal, with only 50% of patients reaching age 30 years (see Ref. 12Slaugenhaupt S.A. Blumenfeld A. Gill S.P. Leyne M. Mull J. Cuajungco M.P. Liebert C.B. Chadwick B.

The identification of IKAP as a component of the human Elongator complex opens the possibility that the disease might be caused by reduced tissue-specific expression of genes and that it thus could be a transcription disorder. A further intriguing connection between Elongator and human disease stems from the recent finding that amino acid substitutions in the IKAP gene product can significantly increase the risk for bronchial asthma in children (25Takeoka S. Unoki M. Onouchi Y. Doi S. Fujiwara H. Miyatake A. Fujita K. Inoue I. Nakamura Y. Tamari M. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 46: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, these connections suggest that cell lines with perturbed Elongator function might be used in genomics approaches to identify genes whose altered expression are causing these diseases. Intriguingly, the hELP2 subunit of human Elongator is encoded by the homologue of mouse StIP1, which was recently isolated in a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the conserved coiled-coil domain of the STAT3 protein (10Collum R.G. Brutsaert S. Lee G. Schindler C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10120-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). StIP1 exhibits an affinity for several STATs and also Janus kinases, and overexpression of the STAT3-binding domain of StIP1 blocks STAT3 activation, nuclear localization, and STAT3-dependent induction of a reporter gene (10Collum R.G. Brutsaert S. Lee G. Schindler C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10120-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). StIP1 was thus proposed to be a scaffold protein for the assembly of factors in the STAT signaling cascade in much the same way as IKAP was initially proposed to be a scaffold protein for the IκB signaling cascade (9Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These data are surprising in light of our finding of human StIP1 (hELP2) as a component of the RNAPII-interacting Elongator complex and because signaling pathways such as the NF-κB- and the Janus kinase/STAT pathway are not conserved in lower eukaryotes, while StIP1/Elp2 clearly is. Possible explanations to this conundrum include that the reported interactions between the WD40 repeats of StIP1 (Elp2) and proteins of the Janus kinase/STAT pathway are nonspecific. Alternatively, Elongator might shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, or it might serve multiple distinct roles, or proteins that are subunits of the complex might play multiple roles. Our finding that IKAP is present both in Elongator and in fractions lacking detectable hELP3, and the fact that IKAP (and to a lesser degree hELP3) can be detected in the nucleoplasm, nucleoli, and cytoplasm of HeLa cells would be consistent with multiple roles for Elongator proteins in distinct cellular compartments.

This involves the interaction between the C terminus of SIR3 and the N terminus of histone H4. Since H4 is hypoacetylated in heterochromatin we wished to determine whether acetylation is involved in regulating the contacts between SIR3 and H4. Binding of H4 peptide (residues 1–34) acetylated at lysines Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16 to an immobilized SIR3 protein fragment (residues 510–970) was investigated using surface plasmon resonance. We find that acetylation of H4 lysines reduces binding (K a) of H4 to SIR3 in a cumulative manner so that the fully acetylated peptide binding is decreased ∼50-fold relative to unacetylated peptide. Thus, by affecting SIR3-H4 binding, acetylation may regulate the formation of heterochromatin. These data help explain the hypoacetylated state of histone H4 in heterochromatin of eukaryotes.

In yeast, the silent mating loci (HMLα andHMRa) and sub-telomeric regions have many features of higher eukaryotic heterochromatin and can silence genes transposed to their vicinity in an epigenetic manner (1Thompson J.H.

SIR2, SIR3, and SIR4 proteins then spread from the initiation site along chromatin (7Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 8Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Direct binding, genetic studies, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments argue that the formation and spreading of heterochromatin involves the interaction of SIR3 and SIR4 with the histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tails. Overexpression of SIR3 alone spreads the silent state appreciably (9Renauld H. Aparicio O.M. Zierath P.D. Billington B.L. Chhablani S.K. Gottschling D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and single mutations of the H4 tail strongly disrupt SIR3 binding (6Thompson J.S. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dominant interaction is likely to be that between SIR3 and the H4 tail. silencing information regulators surface plasmon resonance: GST, glutathioneS-transferase response units flow cell acetylated silencing information regulators surface plasmon resonance: GST, glutathioneS-transferase response units flow cell acetylated Lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of all four core histones, including H4, are hypoacetylated in yeast heterochromatin even at H4 Lys-12 a site previously thought to be preferentially acetylated in yeast heterochromatin (10Braunstein M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7991-8000Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Genetic disruption of heterochromatin by deletion of SIR genes results in increased acetylation at all core histone sites. This was shown recently using chromatin immunoprecipitation and highly specific antibodies to acetylation sites. However, it is not known whether hypoacetylation is a cause or result of the heterochromatic state. For example, the underlying DNA in heterochromatin is refractory to a number of molecular probes such as nucleases and dam methylase (12Gottschling D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4062-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, heterochromatin may prevent access to certain histone-modifying proteins and thereby persist in a hypoacetylated state. Interestingly, mutations in histone deacetylases such as HDA1 and RPD3 result in improved rather than decreased silencing of heterologous genes by heterochromatin (13Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Suka N. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 14Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15De Rubertis F. Kadosh D. Henchoz S. Pauli D. Reuter G. Struhl K. Spierer P. Nature. 1996; 384: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, since these deacetylases are known to affect the expression of heterochromatin proteins (16Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) it is possible that their role in silencing heterochromatin is indirect. In this paper we have directly addressed the function of acetylation in regulating SIR3-H4 interactions by analyzing the binding of SIR3 to unacetylated and acetylated H4 peptides in vitro. The interaction between SIR3 and H4 involves two distinct regions at the histone H4 N terminus. Residues 16–29 represent an essential site of interaction since non-conservative substitutions within this region strongly decrease HM and telomeric silencing (17Johnson L.M. Fisher-Adams G. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Johnson L.M. Kayne P.S. Kahn E.S. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6286-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and SIR3 binding to HM and telomeric heterochromatinin vivo (7Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 8Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Also the H4 sequence 15–34 that contains the major silencing domain has been shown to interact directly with SIR3 residues 623–910 in vitro (5Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). H4 residues between amino acids 4–14 also influence silencing albeit less strongly. Mutation or deletion of acetylatable lysines Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-12 has little effect on HM silencing or SIR3 binding at HM loci (7Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, these residues have a measurable effect on telomeric silencing that is more sensitive to genetic disruption than that of the HM loci (6Thompson J.S. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Moreover, conservative mutations at Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-12 can suppress in part even the HM silencing defect caused by a non-conservative H4 K16Q mutation (5Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Also, neutral amino acid substitutions at Lys-5, Lys-8, or Lys-12 can relieve the deleterious effect on HMsilencing that occurs when all four lysine residues are replaced by arginines (10Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Finally, residues within 4–14 can bind SIR3 in vitro even in a K16Q mutant (5Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). These data all argue for the importance in silencing of residues 16–29 and, to a lesser extent, residues 4–14. Non-conservative substitution at H4 Lys-16 disrupts silencing ofHM loci, while conservative substitution has little effect (18Johnson L.M. Kayne P.S. Kahn E.S. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6286-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 19Park E.C. Szostak J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4932-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, while these data argue for the importance of the charge at Lys-16 they do not address the role of acetylation directly. In direct binding experiments histone H4 acetylation was found to improve binding to bromodomains of proteins p300 and TAFII250 as measured by calorimetry (2020. Dhalluin, C., Carlson, J. E., Zeng, L., He, C., Aggarwal, A. K., Zhou, M. M. Nature 399, 491-496.Google Scholar, 21Jacobson R.H. Ladurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R. Science. 2000; 288: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In contrast, mono- or diacetylated H4 was shown to bind the repressor TUP1 in far-Western assays while tri- and tetracetylated H4 are not found in these complexes (22Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In these data it appears that increased H4 acetylation is associated with reduced TUP1 binding. Therefore, it is evident that H4 acetylation can have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on its interaction with other proteins. To determine whether acetylation of histone H4 can regulate its binding to SIR3 we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to examine the binding of acetylated H4 peptides to the relevant SIR3 domain in vitro. Synthetic H4 peptides (N-terminal residues 1–34) with and without acetyl-lysine at positions Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16 were used. We then measured the binding of SIR3 (residues 503–970) to the H4 peptides. We report that acetylation of H4 peptide at Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16 strongly decreases SIR3 binding. These data suggest that hypoacetylation of H4 is necessary for efficient SIR3 binding and the formation of heterochromatin in yeast. Plasmid pKL104, containing a HindIII-EcoRI restriction fragment of SIR3 residues 503–970 in vector pGEX2TK (AP Biotech), was expressed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The strain was grown in LB+ampicillin at 37 °C until A 600nm = 0.4, then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (0.2 mm), and growth was continued at 30 °C for 2 h. TheE. coli were harvested by centrifugation, and the GST fusion protein was purified on Glutathione-Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer (AP biotech). The eluted protein was concentrated by spin ultrafiltration (Centriprep 30, Amicon). This material was chromatographed on Superdex 200 PG in HBS buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (w/v) Surfactant P20) to separate the ∼80 kDa fusion protein from smaller molecular weight contaminants. GST-SIR3 (503–970) was visualized by Serva (Heidelberg, Germany) Blue R staining of a 10% acrylamide:bis (30:0.8) SDS-PAGE and observed to be greater than 95% pure. GST alone (pGEX2TK) was purified by identical procedures. Peptides were synthesized by the Biopolymer Synthesis Center at California Institute of Technology (Pasadena, CA). For SPR binding assays the C-terminal cysteine was oxidized by performic acid oxidation (23Hirs C. Hirs C. Enzyme Structure. XI. Academic Press, New York1967: 197-199Google Scholar) to reduce nonspecific binding to the sensor chip B1 (Biacore). Peptides were extensively lyophilized and resuspended in HBS buffer. Oxidation of cysteine to cysteic acid was confirmed for each peptide by mass spectroscopy (data not shown). A Biacore B1 sensor chip was activated and prepared with 10,000 RU (response units) of anti-GST antibody and then washed and blocked using the GST Kit for Fusion Capture according to the manufacturers recommendations (Biacore), on a Biacore X instrument. The SIR3-GST fusion (ligand) (1500 RU) was loaded onto flow cell 2 (fc2), and an equal molar quantity of GST alone on fc1. The flow path was from fc1 to fc2, and analyte binding response was determined by subtracting fc1 from fc2. Binding assays were performed in HBS buffer at a linear flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C with a 5-Hz data sampling rate. Each peptide (analyte) was injected in duplicate at concentrations of 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 μm in HBS buffer. Regeneration of the chip with less than 1 RU loss per cycle was achieved by injection of 10 μl of 1 m NaCl:HBS solution. This flow rate was tested for mass transport limitations, and it was found to not be mass transport-limited (data not shown). Data analysis was performed by non-linear least squares analysis using BIAevaluation software version 3 (Biacore) assuming 1:1 Langumuir binding (A + B ⇆ AB). Data for kinetics was taken as an average of two assays at each concentration, except for H4 (Lys-5, -8, -12, -16)-Ac where the RU values for the lowest two concentrations were not measurable. To determine whether acetylation of the histone H4 N terminus affects its binding to SIR3, we measured the affinity of various acetylated H4 peptides for SIR3 by SPR. The regions of histone H4 (residues 1–34) and SIR3 (residues 510–970) used for SPR binding analysis are shown boxed in Fig.1. The H4 peptides contain the acetylation sites (Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16) as well as the rest of the genetically determined silencing domain (residues 16–29). These were interacted with the region of SIR3 (residues 510–970) that includes residues 623–910, a domain that has been shown to bind histone H4 residues 15–34 in vitro (5Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Peptides containing single acetylated sites as well as combinations of two, three, or all four sites were analyzed for their affinity for GST-SIR3 (503–970) bound to a Biacore B1 sensor chip and compared with a control chip containing GST alone (Fig.2). The association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants, the association equilibrium constant (K a) and standard free-energy changes (ΔG0) are shown in Table I. We found that ΔG0 for the association of unacetylated H4 peptide with the SIR3 C terminus is −49.1 kJ·mol−1while the ΔG0 for the association of fully acetylated H4 peptide with SIR3 is −33.2 kJ·mol−1. This stabilization free-energy (δΔG0 = −9.75 kJ·mol−1) favors the interaction between hypoacetylated H4 and SIR3 and may contribute to the requirement for a hypoacetylated state at heterochromatic regions like the silent HM loci and at yeast telomeres (24Suka N.

A comparison of ka values reveals that monoacetylated H4 peptides associated with SIR3 only 60–70% as well as unmodified peptide, di-acetylated peptide ∼40%, tri-acetylated peptides 14–22%, and tetracetylated peptide 2.7% relative to unacetylated peptide. These data indicate that the acetylation-induced disruption of H4-SIR3 binding is cumulative (Fig.3). There is considerable redundancy in the ability of acetylated lysines to prevent SIR3 binding since similar results are obtained irrespective of which lysine (Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, or Lys-16) is acetylated. Acetylation of lysines Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-12 has a similar effect on K a as does acetylation at Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-16, or at Lys-8, Lys-12, Lys-16 (ranging from 3.9 × 106m−1to 6.1 × 106m−1). The most dramatic reduction in association occurs when all four lysines are acetylated resulting in a K a value of 5.9 × 105m−1. This is a 50-fold decrease in K a compared with the unacetylated H4-SIR3 interaction (K a = 2.96 × 107m−1). While acetylation of H4 causes a decrease in association rates (ka), disassociation rates (kd ranging from 1.7 × 10−3s−1 to 2.35 × 10−3 s−1) are only modestly perturbed by changes in acetylation. If we extrapolate from these in vitro interactions to those occurring in vivo, hypoacetylation of H4 may promote the formation of heterochromatin but may have little effect on its maintenance. Also, during the process of yeast aging, SIR proteins are released from telomeres and the silent mating loci and are transferred to the rDNA locus (14Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kennedy B.K. Gotta M. Sinclair D.A. Mills K. McNabb D.S. Murthy M. Pak S.M. Laroche T. Gasser S.M. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 89: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Histone H4 at the rDNA locus is likely to be deacetylated by the SIR2 enzyme. The favorable association rate (ka) for SIR3 binding to hypoacetylated H4 may facilitate the relocalization event. It is possible that the observed binding of the unacetylated peptide to SIR3 is due predominantly to ionic interactions and that neutralization of the positive charge on lysine via acetylation causes the reduced binding. If charge effects alone are responsible for H4-SIR3 binding then increasing the ionic strength of the solvent would be expected to reduce overall binding. To address this possibility, we analyzed the binding of unacetylated H4 residues 1–34 to SIR3 at various ionic strengths ranging from 100 to 250 NaCl. We found that increasing the salt concentration from 100 to 175 mm NaCl resulted in increased association and slightly decreased dissociation rate of the H4-SIR3 peptides (Fig. 4). Higher NaCl concentrations did not markedly affect peptide association or disassociation. Therefore, the interactions between unacetylated H4 and SIR3 are not simply a consequence of electrostatic interactions. It is possible that structural features that are otherwise enhanced by the presence of NaCl may play a role in modulating H4-SIR3 binding. For example, unacetylated chromatin has been shown to adopt a more folded conformation in the presence of salt (26Garcia-Ramierez M. Rocchini C. Ausio J. J. Biol.

This compaction may serve to improve binding by limiting the possible conformations of the H4 tail to that which most resembles the SIR3-bound orientation. It is also possible that the steric bulk of the acetyl moiety and the propensity for acetylated histone tails to form α-helical structures (28Wang X. Moore S.C. Laszckzak M. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35013-35020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) decrease interactions between acetylated H4 and SIR3. In vivo, substitution of Lys-16 with glutamine has a strong disruptive effect on silencing while similar substitutions at Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-12 have much weaker effects. Also, bulk monoacetylated H4 is acetylated predominantly at Lys-16 in vivo suggesting that this site has unique functions inside the cell. However, we find that acetylation at any of the four H4 lysine residues has similar effects on reducing SIR3-H4 binding in vitro. This suggests that the in vivo context is important in further regulating SIR3-H4 interactions. This could occur if H4 Lys-16 acetylation is a unique trigger for the acetylation of the remaining H4 sites in vivo. If so, acetylation or non-conservative substitution of Lys-16 in vivo may lead to acetylation of the other H4 sites thereby disrupting heterochromatin. This would lead to the hyperacetylation of all histone sites. Conversely, since SIR2 heterochromatin protein is a deacetylase with specificity for H4 Lys-16 (14Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1999; 99: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), deacetylation of Lys-16 in vivo may lead to the hypoacetylation of Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-12 resulting in a fully deacetylated state. In conclusion, yeast heterochromatin is formed as part of a complex that includes RAP1, SIR3, and histone H4 among other proteins (7Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The interaction between SIR3 and H4 is crucial for the stable formation of this complex. While the in vitro experiments described here utilize only relevant portions of H4 and SIR3, it is clear that acetylation of H4 strongly reduces H4-SIR3 binding in this system. Therefore, hypoacetylation of H4 is likely to favor the formation of heterochromatin in vivo in the context of contributions from other proteins in the silencing complex and the presence of DNA. Given that SIR2 is a histone H4 deacetylase, our data support a model in which deacetylation of H4 by SIR2 promotes SIR3-H4 binding and by inference the subsequent formation of heterochromatin (29Landry J.

In the present study, we show that the kainate receptor antagonist LY382884 (10 microM) is selective for presynaptic kainate receptors in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. At a concentration at which it blocks mossy fiber LTP, LY382884 selectively blocks the synaptic activation of a presynaptic kainate receptor that facilitates AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Following the induction of mossy fiber LTP, there is a complete loss of the presynaptic kainate receptor-mediated facilitation of synaptic transmission. These results identify a central role for the presynaptic kainate receptor in the induction of mossy fiber LTP. In addition, these results suggest that the pathway by which kainate receptors facilitate glutamate release is utilized for the expression of mossy fiber LTP."

https://openalex.org/W2092311426,"The regulation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit composition and expression during development is thought to control the process of thalamocortical afferent innervation, segregation, and plasticity. Thalamocortical synaptic plasticity in the mouse is dependent on NMDARs containing the NR2B subunit, which are the dominant form during the “critical period” window for plasticity. Near the end of the critical period there is a gradual increase in the contribution of NR2A subunits that happens in parallel to changes in NMDAR-mediated current kinetics. However, no extension of the critical period occurs in NR2A knockout mice, despite the fact that NMDA subunit composition and current kinetics remain immature past the end of the critical period. These data suggest that regulation of NMDAR subunit composition is not essential for closing the critical period plasticity window in mouse somatosensory barrel cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2074404563,"Intrinsic transcription termination plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in prokaryotes. After a short pause, the termination signal appears in RNA as a hairpin that destabilizes the elongation complex (EC). We demonstrate that negative and positive termination factors control the efficiency of termination primarily through a direct modulation of hairpin folding and, to a much lesser extent, by changing pausing at the point of termination. The mechanism controlling hairpin formation at the termination point relies on weak protein interactions with single-stranded RNA, which corresponds to the upstream portion of the hairpin. Escherichia coli NusA protein destabilizes these interactions and thus promotes hairpin folding and termination. Stabilization of these contacts by phage lambda N protein leads to antitermination."

Sortase cleaves polypeptides between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif. The carboxyl group of threonine is subsequently amide-linked to the amino group of peptidoglycan cross-bridges. The three-dimensional structure of sortase revealed the close proximity of the catalytic site residue cysteine 184 with histidine 120; however, no structural evidence for a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair could be detected. We report that alanine substitution of either cysteine 184 or histidine 120 abolishes in vivo and in vitro sorting reactions. Further, alanine substitution of tryptophan 194, a residue that is in close proximity of histidine 120, reduces the transpeptidase activity of sortase. These results suggest a model whereby sortase forms a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair for the catalysis of its transpeptidation reaction and that the position of tryptophan 194 assists in the formation of this ion pair."
https://openalex.org/W2151133360,"Entry of anthrax edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF) into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells depends on their ability to translocate across the endosomal membrane in the presence of anthrax protective antigen (PA). Here we report attributes of the N-terminal domains of EF and LF (EFN and LFN, respectively) that are critical for their initial interaction with PA. We found that deletion of the first 36 residues of LFN had no effect on its binding to PA or its ability to be translocated. To map the binding site for PA, we used the three-dimensional structure of LF and sequence similarity between EF and LF to select positions for mutagenesis. We identified seven sites in LFN (Asp-182, Asp-187, Leu-188, Tyr-223, His-229, Leu-235, and Tyr-236) where mutation to Ala produced significant binding defects, with H229A and Y236A almost completely eliminating binding. Homologous mutants of EFN displayed nearly identical defects. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed that the LFN mutations impact intoxication. The seven mutation-sensitive amino acids are clustered on the surface of LF and form a small convoluted patch with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. We propose that this patch constitutes the recognition site for PA."

Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar, 2Jacobson K. Sheets E.D. Simson R. Science. 1995; 268: 1441-1442Google Scholar). Rafts correspond to a category of microdomains, enriched in sphingolipids (SPL)1 and cholesterol (Chl), which play a key role in the expression and regulation of the plasma membrane functions (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Google Scholar, 4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached essentially through the use of two experimental procedures, the low temperature non-ionic detergent extraction (2Jacobson K. Sheets E.D. Simson R. Science. 1995; 268: 1441-1442Google Scholar) and the Chl depletion of cells (5Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Google Scholar,6Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Google Scholar). The resistance to low temperature, non-ionic detergent extraction of numerous membrane proteins is associated to a liquid ordered (Lo) or to a gel ordered (Lβ) state of membrane lipids, which strongly suggests that the physical state of these membrane lipids is of primary importance in the formation of the membrane microdomains mosaic (7Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Google Scholar, 8Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Google Scholar). Formation of the Lo phase, or more precisely of the fluid liquid ordered Loα and gel liquid ordered Loβ phases (9McMullen T.P. McElhaney R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 90-98Google Scholar), depends on the presence of Chl (10Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10676-10684Google Scholar, 11Ipsen J.H. Karlstrom G. Mouritsen O.G. Wennerstrom H. Zuckermann M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 162-172Google Scholar). SPL also appear to be determinant for the existence of eucaryotic plasma membrane rafts (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Google Scholar,4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar), and this could be explained by the preferential interaction of Chl with SPL rather than with the other phospholipid species in natural phospholipid-Chl mixtures (10Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10676-10684Google Scholar, 12Demel R.A. Kalsbeek R. Wirtz K.W. Van Deenen L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 10-22Google Scholar, 13Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 13-27Google Scholar). Because SPL are essentially localized on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane (14Op den Kamp J.A.F. Finean J.B. Michell R.H. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 1. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981: 83-126Google Scholar), this strongly suggests that this membrane leaflet plays a crucial role in the existence of microdomains.Renal brush-border membranes (BBM), which constitute the apical membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial cells, are highly ordered structures, as shown by fluorescence polarization and ESR data (15Le Grimellec C. Carriere S. Cardinal J. Giocondi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F227-F231Google Scholar). Their glycerophospholipid GPL/SPL/Chl ratio (0.9:0.7:1), where sphingomyelin accounts for >95% of SPL (reviewed in Ref. 16Le Grimellec C. Friedlander G. el Yandouzi E.H. Zlatkine P. Giocondi M.C. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 825-836Google Scholar), is close to that reported (1:1:1) by Brown and Rose (1Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar) for the detergent-resistant membrane fragments (DRMs). As a consequence of the asymmetrical distribution of SPL in membranes, the BBM external leaflet is composed of ∼75% sphingomyelin (SM) and 25% zwitterionic phospholipids, essentially phosphatidylcholine (17Venien C. Aubry M. Crine P. Le Grimellec C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 325-330Google Scholar). To better understand the properties of these membranes, the existence, size, and in-plane distribution of microdomains in Langmuir-Blodgett films with a lipid composition mimicking that of the BBM external leaflet was recently examined (18Milhiet P.E. Domec C. Giocondi M.C. Van Mau N. Heitz F. Grimellec C.l. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 547-555Google Scholar) by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is a useful tool for probing the mesoscopic lateral organization of lipid mixtures (19Dufrêne Y.F. Barger W.R. Green J.-B. Lee G.U. Langmuir. 1997; 13: 4779-4784Google Scholar, 20Shao Z. Zhang Y. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 141-152Google Scholar, 21Vié V. Van Mau N. Lesniewska E. Goudonnet J.P. Heitz F. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 1998; 14: 4574-4583Google Scholar, 22Yuan C.B. Johnston L.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1059-1069Google Scholar, 23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar). The results of these AFM experiments suggested that the phospholipids of BBM external leaflet should be under phase separation conditions, even in the absence of Chl.The use of Langmuir-Blodgett films provides a basic step for the understanding of the physicochemical properties of isolated membrane leaflets (24Brockman H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 438-443Google Scholar), but interactions between the two membrane leaflets could modify the properties of each leaflet. Accordingly, in this paper we have studied, by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and AFM, the Chl effect in lipid bilayers made of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), bovine brain SM, and Chl mixtures.MATERIALS AND METHODSPOPC, bovine brain SM, and Chl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin, France). Lipids were dissolved in a chloroform/methanol solution (2/1, v/v) at concentrations of 10 mm. Phospholipids and Chl concentrations in solutions were determined as described previously (17Venien C. Aubry M. Crine P. Le Grimellec C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 325-330Google Scholar). Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) were prepared at 60 °C in phosphate saline buffer (PBS, pH 7.4), under argon, from stock solutions (15Le Grimellec C. Carriere S. Cardinal J. Giocondi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F227-F231Google Scholar).Atomic Force MicroscopySmall unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared at 60 °C by sonication of MLVs under argon. To achieve the formation of the supported bilayer (23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar), SUVs were deposited on a freshly cleaved mica disc (one-half-inch diameter), inserted in a 13-mm holder for swinney syringe (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and incubated, without exposure to air, in a water bath for 3 h at 80 °C. At the end of the incubation, the holder was let to equilibrate to room temperature. The bilayers, always maintained in an aqueous environment, were carefully rinsed with PBS to remove the SUV in excess. The bottom of the mica support was dried with a tissue paper and glued onto a 32-mm diameter glass coverslip with Super Glue 3 (Loctite). The coverslips were mounted on the stage of the inverted microscope (Zeiss), coupled to a Bioscope (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). The microscope was run, at room temperature, in contact mode as described previously (18Milhiet P.E. Domec C. Giocondi M.C. Van Mau N. Heitz F. Grimellec C.l. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 547-555Google Scholar, 23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar). Silicon nitride cantilevers with nominal spring constant between 0.01 and 0.06 newton/m (Digital Instruments, and Park Scientific Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA) were used in most of the experiments. The scanning force was adjusted to below 0.3 nanonewton. Scan rate was varied from 1 to 2.5 Hz. Images were obtained from at least three different samples prepared on different days with at least five macroscopically separated areas on each sample.Differential Scanning CalorimetryThe calorimetry of MLVs was done on a MicroCal MC-2 calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). For all samples a heating scan rate of 10 °C/h was used. Sample runs were repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. The SM concentration in the calorimeter cell was 7 mm for pure SM, 15 mm for 1:3 POPC/SM, and 22.5 mm for the samples containing 20, 25, or 33 mol % Chl.DISCUSSIONAccording to the current view, the cell plasma membrane is organized as a mosaic of ordered microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and Chl and of fluid domains. Upon Chl depletion, the ordered microdomains vanish, and the diluted sphingolipids become miscible with the fluid domains. Using a lipid bilayer model close to biological membranes, we provide here strong evidence that, in cells rich in membrane sphingolipids like the renal epithelial cells, Chl depletion might not suppress the membrane domains. Furthermore our results strongly suggest that, in membranes highly enriched in sphingolipids, there is a threshold close to the physiological concentration above which Chl acts as a suppressor rather than as a promoter of membrane domains.Phase Separation in POPC/SM BilayersThe presence of a broad endothermic transition with two maxima at 9 and 29 °C and the AFM images showing the presence at room temperature of domains from mesoscopic to microscopic sizes indicate that POPC/SM 1:3 mixtures form bilayers in which gel domains enriched in SM coexist with liquid crystalline domains enriched in POPC. The present calorimetric data compare with those obtained for mixtures of egg PC/SM at the same molar ratio (26Untracht S.H. Shipley G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4449-4457Google Scholar), which can be explained by considering the fatty acid composition of egg PC. AFM detection of lipid-lipid immiscibility in supported bilayers essentially depends on the apparent difference in thickness (δh) between the lipid domains. The δh is the sum of the absolute height difference between the domains plus a variable height contribution, which depends on the local mechanical properties of the lipid and on the scanning force applied (19Dufrêne Y.F. Barger W.R. Green J.-B. Lee G.U. Langmuir. 1997; 13: 4779-4784Google Scholar, 21Vié V. Van Mau N. Lesniewska E. Goudonnet J.P. Heitz F. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 1998; 14: 4574-4583Google Scholar, 23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar). For the different binary and ternary lipid mixtures under phase separation made by vesicle fusion so far examined (19Dufrêne Y.F. Barger W.R. Green J.-B. Lee G.U. Langmuir. 1997; 13: 4779-4784Google Scholar, 23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar, 30Reviakine I. BergsmaSchutter W. MazeresDubut C. Govorukhina N. Brisson A. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 234-239Google Scholar), the observation that gel phase phospholipid domains have a constant δh above fluid phase domains likely corresponds to a superimposition of gel-gel and fluid-fluid domains of each membrane leaflet (23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar). This interpretation is strongly supported by the existence of domains of intermediate height when the bilayers are made by Langmuir-Blodgett successive transfers (31Hollars C.W. Dunn R.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 342-353Google Scholar). Accordingly, the protruding domains observed here in the POPC/SM bilayers can be attributed to Lβ SM-enriched domains present in the external leaflet, accessible to the AFM tip, superimposed on SM-enriched domains of the same size and shape facing the mica substrate. The darker matrix is made of POPC Lα enriched domains. This phase coupling between the two leaflets has also been observed in giant liposomes using fluorescence techniques (32Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys J. 2001; 80: 1417-1428Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the height of the buffer-bathed surface of the bilayer above the mica substrate was ∼9 nm. Compared with x-ray diffraction data on SM multi-bilayers (33Maulik P.R. Shipley G.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8025-8034Google Scholar), this suggests that the buffer layer between the mica and the bilayer has a thickness between 3 and 4 nm, a value close to that estimated by neutron diffraction of supported bilayers (34Johnson S.J. Bayerl T.M. McDermott D.C. Adam G.W. Rennie A.R. Thomas R.K. Sackmann E. Biophys J. 1991; 59: 289-294Google Scholar). Shape and size of the domains varied from small (150 nm) disc shaped to large (3 μm) elongated structures. This variety, already reported for supported bilayers made of a binary mixture of synthetic phospholipids under phase separation, illustrates the complexity of the phase separation process when observed at the mesoscopic scale (23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar).Phase Separation in BBM Model BilayersThe effects of Chl on the topology of the bilayer can be resumed as follow: at 20 mol % Chl domains were still present, connected, and the average surface of these protruding domains was slightly increased as compared with the POPC/SM bilayer. In regard to their height above the matrix, a single population of domains was still visualized, strongly suggesting that the two leaflets were coupled by these light domains. They disconnected for 25 mol % Chl and were no longer visible for 33 mol % Chl. These topological observations at 20 and 25 mol % Chl were in qualitative agreement with our previous results on monolayers of identical compositions (18Milhiet P.E. Domec C. Giocondi M.C. Van Mau N. Heitz F. Grimellec C.l. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 547-555Google Scholar). Corresponding DSC scans indicated that 20 mol % Chl markedly decreased the height of the high temperature peak and practically suppressed the low temperature's one while shifting toward a higher temperature at the upper end of the transition. This broadening effect of Chl associated to the formation of the Lo phases has been documented for PC/Chl and SM/Chl mixtures (9McMullen T.P. McElhaney R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 90-98Google Scholar, 35Maulik P.R. Shipley G.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2256-2265Google Scholar). As expected, enthalpy of the transition was further decreased at 25 mol % Chl, and the DSC scan became more symmetrical. Thus, in 1:3 POPC/SM bilayers, Chl interacted with both SM and POPC. Both the complexity of the thermogram and the operating range of the calorimeter (0–115 °C), which limits the accuracy of the detection of the onset of the transition, did not allow to conclude about the existence of the reported preferential interaction between SM and Chl (10Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10676-10684Google Scholar, 12Demel R.A. Kalsbeek R. Wirtz K.W. Van Deenen L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 10-22Google Scholar, 13Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 13-27Google Scholar). Addition of 20 mol % Chl to the bilayers reduced the δh from 0.7 to 0.4 nm. Such a reduction likely involved both the decrease in bilayer thickness at the level of SM enriched domains (35Maulik P.R. Shipley G.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2256-2265Google Scholar) and the increase in the bilayer thickness of the POPC enriched domains (36Nezil F.A. Bloom M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 1176-1183Google Scholar) promoted by Chl. At 33 mol % Chl, no membrane domains were visualized by AFM, either at the microscopic or at the mesoscopic scales, which strongly suggests that the bilayer was in the liquid ordered phase. These AFM data differ from those obtained on monolayers, where microdomains 20–70 nm in size forming a branched network were observed (18Milhiet P.E. Domec C. Giocondi M.C. Van Mau N. Heitz F. Grimellec C.l. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 547-555Google Scholar). This suggests that coupling between membrane leaflets might affect the interactions between Chl and phospholipids in each monolayer. Such qualitative differences in the behavior of monolayers versus bilayers was previously reported for POPC/Chl mixtures (37Hernandez-Borrell J. Keough K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1153: 277-282Google Scholar, 38Worthman L.A. Nag K. Davis P.J. Keough K.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2569-2580Google Scholar). Taking into account this limitation we cannot ascertain if the DSC thermogram at 33 mol % Chl is associated with the presence of a single (Lo) or multiple (Loα+ Loβ+ Lβ) ordered phases. Our AFM data on a model of the renal BBM lipids differ from those reported recently on 1:1 DOPC/SM bilayers containing variable amounts of Chl, where large domains still persist at 50 mol % Chl (39Rinia H.A. Snel M.M.E. van der Eerden J. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 92-96Google Scholar). Besides the difference in the PC/SM molar ratio used, this different finding can be explained by the fact that Chl tends to be segregated out in unsaturated PC membranes and poorly interacts with DOPC in DOPC/SM mixtures (12Demel R.A. Kalsbeek R. Wirtz K.W. Van Deenen L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 10-22Google Scholar). Using two-photon fluorescence imaging, Dietrich et al. (32Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys J. 2001; 80: 1417-1428Google Scholar) reported the existence of a Lα-Lo phase separation in GUVs made of renal BBM total lipid extracts. Our experiments suggest that this liquid disordered-liquid ordered phase separation is due to the loss in the asymmetrical distribution of SM and of the other phospholipids upon lipid extraction and GUVs preparation, which results in the mixing of the inner and external membrane leaflets components.Plasma Membranes ImplicationsThe present AFM data strongly suggest that the phospholipids constituting the renal BBM external leaflet phase separate to form domains, and then Chl is not necessary to observe a mesoscopic scale membrane lateral heterogeneity linked to a Lo phase. The differences in bilayer topography recorded between 25 and 33 mol % Chl also suggest that limited variation in the Chl content of BBM can have a marked effect on their membrane organization. Purified DRMs in a Lo phase have a 1:1:1 GPL/SPL/Chl ratio (1Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar) giving a 0.8:3.2:2 GPL/SPL/Chl ratio for the composition of the DRMs external leaflet if one considers that ∼80% SPL are on the external DRMs leaflet and that Chl is asymmetrically distributed across the membrane. This lipid composition compares well with the 1:3:2 POPC/SM/Chl ratio chosen here to mimick a renal BBM external leaflet containing 33 mol % Chl. Thus, the external leaflets of renal BBM and isolated DRMs have a comparable composition in terms of lipid classes, which most likely results in a comparable physical state. Accordingly, our data suggest that Chl depletion of purified DRMs should result in a GPL/SPL phase separation. It seems that such a behavior is probably not restricted to renal cells, since a similar 1:1:1 GPL/SPL/Chl ratio was found for the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells (40Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Google Scholar) and that, in accordance with this view, lipid rafts can exist as Chl-independent microdomains in intestinal BBM (41Hansen G.H. Immerdal L. Thorsen E. Niels Christiansen L.L. Nystrom B.T. Demant E.J.F. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32338-32344Google Scholar). According to the current view, the plasma membrane of eucaryotic cells is organized in an in-plane mosaic of microdomains (1Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar, 2Jacobson K. Sheets E.D. Simson R. Science. 1995; 268: 1441-1442Google Scholar). Rafts correspond to a category of microdomains, enriched in sphingolipids (SPL)1 and cholesterol (Chl), which play a key role in the expression and regulation of the plasma membrane functions (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Google Scholar, 4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached essentially through the use of two experimental procedures, the low temperature non-ionic detergent extraction (2Jacobson K. Sheets E.D. Simson R. Science. 1995; 268: 1441-1442Google Scholar) and the Chl depletion of cells (5Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Google Scholar,6Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Google Scholar). The resistance to low temperature, non-ionic detergent extraction of numerous membrane proteins is associated to a liquid ordered (Lo) or to a gel ordered (Lβ) state of membrane lipids, which strongly suggests that the physical state of these membrane lipids is of primary importance in the formation of the membrane microdomains mosaic (7Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Google Scholar, 8Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Google Scholar). Formation of the Lo phase, or more precisely of the fluid liquid ordered Loα and gel liquid ordered Loβ phases (9McMullen T.P. McElhaney R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 90-98Google Scholar), depends on the presence of Chl (10Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10676-10684Google Scholar, 11Ipsen J.H. Karlstrom G. Mouritsen O.G. Wennerstrom H. Zuckermann M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 162-172Google Scholar). SPL also appear to be determinant for the existence of eucaryotic plasma membrane rafts (3Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Google Scholar,4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar), and this could be explained by the preferential interaction of Chl with SPL rather than with the other phospholipid species in natural phospholipid-Chl mixtures (10Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10676-10684Google Scholar, 12Demel R.A. Kalsbeek R. Wirtz K.W. Van Deenen L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 10-22Google Scholar, 13Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 13-27Google Scholar). Because SPL are essentially localized on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane (14Op den Kamp J.A.F. Finean J.B. Michell R.H. New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 1. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981: 83-126Google Scholar), this strongly suggests that this membrane leaflet plays a crucial role in the existence of microdomains. Renal brush-border membranes (BBM), which constitute the apical membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial cells, are highly ordered structures, as shown by fluorescence polarization and ESR data (15Le Grimellec C. Carriere S. Cardinal J. Giocondi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F227-F231Google Scholar). Their glycerophospholipid GPL/SPL/Chl ratio (0.9:0.7:1), where sphingomyelin accounts for >95% of SPL (reviewed in Ref. 16Le Grimellec C. Friedlander G. el Yandouzi E.H. Zlatkine P. Giocondi M.C. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 825-836Google Scholar), is close to that reported (1:1:1) by Brown and Rose (1Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar) for the detergent-resistant membrane fragments (DRMs). As a consequence of the asymmetrical distribution of SPL in membranes, the BBM external leaflet is composed of ∼75% sphingomyelin (SM) and 25% zwitterionic phospholipids, essentially phosphatidylcholine (17Venien C. Aubry M. Crine P. Le Grimellec C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 325-330Google Scholar). To better understand the properties of these membranes, the existence, size, and in-plane distribution of microdomains in Langmuir-Blodgett films with a lipid composition mimicking that of the BBM external leaflet was recently examined (18Milhiet P.E. Domec C. Giocondi M.C. Van Mau N. Heitz F. Grimellec C.l. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 547-555Google Scholar) by atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is a useful tool for probing the mesoscopic lateral organization of lipid mixtures (19Dufrêne Y.F. Barger W.R. Green J.-B. Lee G.U. Langmuir. 1997; 13: 4779-4784Google Scholar, 20Shao Z. Zhang Y. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 141-152Google Scholar, 21Vié V. Van Mau N. Lesniewska E. Goudonnet J.P. Heitz F. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 1998; 14: 4574-4583Google Scholar, 22Yuan C.B. Johnston L.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1059-1069Google Scholar, 23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar). The results of these AFM experiments suggested that the phospholipids of BBM external leaflet should be under phase separation conditions, even in the absence of Chl. The use of Langmuir-Blodgett films provides a basic step for the understanding of the physicochemical properties of isolated membrane leaflets (24Brockman H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 438-443Google Scholar), but interactions between the two membrane leaflets could modify the properties of each leaflet. Accordingly, in this paper we have studied, by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and AFM, the Chl effect in lipid bilayers made of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), bovine brain SM, and Chl mixtures. MATERIALS AND METHODSPOPC, bovine brain SM, and Chl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin, France). Lipids were dissolved in a chloroform/methanol solution (2/1, v/v) at concentrations of 10 mm. Phospholipids and Chl concentrations in solutions were determined as described previously (17Venien C. Aubry M. Crine P. Le Grimellec C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 325-330Google Scholar). Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) were prepared at 60 °C in phosphate saline buffer (PBS, pH 7.4), under argon, from stock solutions (15Le Grimellec C. Carriere S. Cardinal J. Giocondi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F227-F231Google Scholar).Atomic Force MicroscopySmall unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared at 60 °C by sonication of MLVs under argon. To achieve the formation of the supported bilayer (23Giocondi M.C. Vié V. Lesniewska E. Milhiet P.E. Zinke-Allmang M. Le Grimellec C. Langmuir. 2001; 17: 1653-1659Google Scholar), SUVs were deposited on a freshly cleaved mica disc (one-half-inch diameter), inserted in a 13-mm holder for swinney syringe (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and incubated, without exposure to air, in a water bath for 3 h at 80 °C. At the end of the incubation, the holder was let to equilibrate to room temperature. The bilayers, always maintained in an aqueous environment, were carefully rinsed with PBS to remove the SUV in excess. The bottom of the mica support was dried with a tissue paper and glued onto a 32-mm diameter glass coverslip with Super Glue 3 (Loctit"
https://openalex.org/W3843308,"Essential to nerve and muscle function, little is known about how potassium leak channels operate. KCNKØ opens and closes in a kinase-dependent fashion. Here, the transition is shown to correspond to changes in the outer aspect of the ion conduction pore. Voltage-gated potassium (VGK) channels open and close via an internal gate; however, they also have an outer pore gate that produces ""C-type"" inactivation. While KCNKØ does not inactivate, KCNKØ and VGK channels respond in like manner to outer pore blockers, potassium, mutations, and chemical modifiers. Structural relatedness is confirmed: VGK residues that come close during C-type gating predict KCNKØ sites that crosslink (after mutation to cysteine) to yield channels controlled by reduction and oxidization. We conclude that similar outer pore gates mediate KCNKØ opening and closing and VGK channel C-type inactivation despite their divergent structures and physiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W2027874936,"Bad is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that is thought to exert a death-promoting effect by heterodimerization with Bcl-XL, nullifying its anti-apoptotic activity. Growth factors may promote cell survival at least partially through phosphorylation of Bad at one or more of Ser-112, -136, or -155. Our previous work showed that Bad is also phosphorylated in response to cytokines at another site, which we now identify as Ser-170. The functional role of this novel phosphorylation site was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of the pro-apoptotic function of Bad in transiently transfected HEK293 and COS-7 cells or by stable expression in the cytokine-dependent cell line, MC/9. In general, mutation of Ser-170 to Ala results in a protein with increased ability to induce apoptosis, similar to the S112A mutant. Mutation of Ser-170 to Asp, mimicking a constitutively phosphorylated site, results in a protein that is virtually unable to induce apoptosis. Similarly, the S112A/S170D double mutant does not cause apoptosis in HEK293 and MC/9 cell lines.

These data strongly suggest that phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-170 is a critical event in blocking the pro-apoptotic activity of Bad. Bcl-2 family proteins have emerged as key players in the regulation of apoptosis in many types of cells (for review, see Refs. 1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

Whereas some members prevent cell death (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1), others exhibit pro-apoptotic activity (Bax, Bak, Bok). The balance between these two groups can be disrupted by a third group of proteins that share at least one common structural motif, a short α-helical region termed the BH3 domain. BH3-only members include Bad, Bim, Bik, Bid, Noxa, and Hrk (3Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 4Oda E. Ohki R.

The model that prevails suggests that BH3-only proteins act in response to death-inducing signals and function to neutralize pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins by heterodimerization, freeing the Bax-like proteins to execute cell death (2Chao D.T.

Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar) that seems to be unique in that its function is regulated by phosphorylation at several sites in response to survival factors. Initial studies by Zha et al. (10Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J.

Recently, a third site, Ser-155, located at the center of the Bad BH3 domain (amino acids 151–163), was shown to be phosphorylated in response to growth factors and prevented the cytotoxic effects of Bad (11Tan Y.

Although the precise mechanisms by which these proteins induce apoptosis are still unclear, the proposed model is that, in its unphosphorylated state, Bad binds to anti-apoptotic proteins (primarily Bcl-XL) and induces cell death (9Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar), perhaps by blocking the pro-survival function of Bcl-XL. When Bad is phosphorylated on one or more of three serine residues Ser112, Ser-136, or Ser-155 in response to survival factors, it is sequestered in the cytosol, complexed to 14-3-3 proteins, and fails to interact with pro-survival Bcl-2 members in the outer mitochondrial membranes (10Zha J.

By definition, phosphatases that dephosphorylate Bad also play an important role in regulating its activity (19Ayllon V. Martinez A.C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A.

Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Although numerous reports have shown the involvement of Bad in induction of apoptosis, recent studies suggest that the Bad protein can also have growth-promoting activity (22Maslyar D.J. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5087-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and can be involved in promoting cell cycle progression (23Chattopadhyay A. Chiang C.W. Yang E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4507-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At present the molecular mechanism by which Bad can mediate such functions is unknown, and the role of Bad phosphorylation in cell cycle regulation is controversial. In one study, phosphorylation at Ser-136 and association with 14-3-3 was found to be essential for its growth-promoting effect (22Maslyar D.J. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5087-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas in the other study only association with Bcl-XL was shown to be required, independent of the phosphorylation state of Bad (23Chattopadhyay A. Chiang C.W. Yang E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4507-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Previous work in our laboratory characterized the phosphorylation of Bad in response to cytokine treatment in the murine mast cell line, MC/9 (24Scheid M.P.

Furthermore, blocking protein kinase B activation had no effect on GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of Bad. Others also report that activation of protein kinase B does not automatically confer a survival signal or result in phosphorylation of Bad in hemopoietic cells (31Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J.

It should be noted that our experiments were carried out in GM-CSF-stimulated MC/9 mast cells that express endogenous levels of Bad and protein kinase B, and thus, the possible connection between protein kinase B activation and Ser-136 may depend on cell type or the particular growth factor being studied. In our characterization of Bad phosphorylation by two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping, we also demonstrated at least two additional novel phosphorylation sites distinct from either Ser-112 or Ser-136 (24Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Here we report the identity of one of these phosphorylation sites as Ser-170, which is a novel site of phosphorylation in murine Bad. We have probed its potential function by the use of mutants altered at Ser-170, and our results strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of Bad at this site may serve a crucial role in regulating its pro-apoptotic activity. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-170 may also play a role in growth promotion in the cytokine-dependent MC/9 mast cells.DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation of Bad at several distinct sites has been shown to be an important link connecting at least some of the effects of extracellular survival factors on the intrinsic cell death machinery regulated by Bcl-2 family members. In this study we have identified a novel site of phosphorylation, Ser-170, which can serve to modulate the pro-apoptotic activity of Bad. We have concentrated on extensive mutational analysis to determine the function of phosphorylation at the Ser-170 site and its relative importance compared with other known sites of phosphorylation on Bad. The cells used for such experiments are important to note, since we have found differences in the effects of Bad expression that depend on cell type. One explanation for such variability in Bad function may be the differences in endogenous levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and perhaps other Bcl-2 family members. However, another factor to consider is the differential expression of specific kinases that can phosphorylate Bad at the various sites. More analyses in various systems testing the role of various kinases in phosphorylation at all sites of Bad will be necessary to fully understand how Bad is inducing apoptosis and how survival pathways may either block or modulate its action.In this study, we first compared the physiological effects of Bad on two different cell lines into which the mutated forms of Bad can be readily introduced by transfection strategies, COS-7 and HEK293. The COS-7 cells were found to be transfected much more efficiently, allowing the analysis of these cells by flow cytometry. COS-7 cells did not appear to be undergoing apoptosis in the presence of wild type Bad, based on the detection of sub-diploid DNA using propidium iodide. However, we did find that the cells expressing Bad were affected by the presence of the protein, undergoing dramatic changes in cell morphology. There was a clear contrast in the effects of introducing Bad with mutations S155A or S170A, both of which caused increased apoptosis as assessed by propidium iodide staining, cell viability, caspase 3 activation, 2S. Dramsi and V. Duronio, unpublished information. and PARP cleavage, compared with the Bad S155D or S170D mutants, which did not cause apoptosis and did not produce any morphologic changes. In the case of HEK293, the wild type Bad protein had a more pronounced effect on the cells that were transfected. However, it was still possible to select stable transfectants that expressed Bad. When cells were transfected with Bad mutants having the major sites of phosphorylation, Ser-112, Ser-155, and as we have now shown, Ser-170, mutated to Ala, there was clearly an enhanced level of apoptosis. Furthermore, changing Ser-170 to the negatively charged Asp had a dramatic effect in limiting the ability of Bad to cause apoptosis, supporting the hypothesis that phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-170 is a key event in controlling its ability to induce apoptosis.We have also tested the Bad mutants in a model system that is more physiologically relevant, the cytokine-dependent MC/9 cells, in which we first characterized phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-170 (24Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We introduced wild type Bad and the various mutants in parental MC/9 cells or MC/9 cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL using retroviral infection strategies and selected stable clones expressing the Bad protein. We did not find any effect of Bad in parental MC/9 cells or in MC/9 overexpressing Bcl-2 (data not shown), in agreement with the results obtained in FL5.12 cells in the first paper describing Bad (9Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). In MC/9 Bcl-XL cells, we found that wild-type Bad as well as Bad with the S170A mutation induced apoptosis upon cytokine starvation, whereas changing Ser-170 to the charged Asp residue had a dramatic inhibitory effect on the function of Bad. In each of the clones in which S170D was present, including the S112A/S170D double mutants, there was greatly enhanced survival of the MC/9 cells, and in fact there was also an increase in cell numbers. This could suggest that phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-170 may not only function to block the pro-apoptosis effect of Bad, but it could have additional growth-promoting effects or enhance the pro-survival function of Bcl-XL. At present, we also cannot rule out the possibility that Bad S170D could have other functions that are independent of its association with Bcl-XL. Further experiments will be required to investigate these possible novel functions of Bad.Several recent reports have also raised the possibility that Bad can have effects on cell cycle progression. Mok et al. (36Mok C.L. Gil-Gomez G. Williams O. Coles M. Taga S. Tolaini M. Norton T. Kioussis D. Brady H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) show that in mouse thymocytes expressing Bad, both the percentage of cells in S phase and the production of IL-2 in those cells were increased substantially. Because Bad also increased thymocyte apoptosis, it was suggested that the effect on cell cycle progression may be attributed to a feedback mechanism, which may be explained as an attempt by these cells to overcome the pro-apoptotic effect of Bad. However, two more recent reports provide intriguing data also showing that Bad can have effects on promoting cell growth and progression through the cell cycle (22Maslyar D.J. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5087-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Chattopadhyay A. Chiang C.W. Yang E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4507-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Maslyar et al. (22Maslyar D.J. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5087-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggest that Bad phosphorylation at Ser-136 and association with 14-3-3 is required for growth promotion in chick embryo fibroblasts (22Maslyar D.J. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5087-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Chattopadhyay et al. (23Chattopadhyay A. Chiang C.W. Yang E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4507-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) find that Bad association with Bcl-XL promoted cell cycle progression through the G0/G1 checkpoint in mouse embryo fibroblasts, but this effect was independent of Bad phosphorylation (23Chattopadhyay A. Chiang C.W. Yang E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4507-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although these studies came to opposite conclusions regarding the requirement for Bad phosphorylation, only the two originally reported sites of phosphorylation on Bad, Ser-112 and Ser-136, were tested. In light of our results, the role of Ser-170 phosphorylation must also be considered.The Ser-170 site lies close to the BH3 region (amino acids 151–163), which was shown to be necessary and sufficient for heterodimerization with Bcl-XL (18Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Mutational studies provide strong evidence that Bad promotes apoptosis by hetero-dimerizing with Bcl-XL, and thus, we attempted to address the question of whether phosphorylation at the Ser-170 site would affect this association. Recent work supports the view that Ser-155 phosphorylation directly prevents hetero-dimerization by abolishing the affinity of Bad BH3 for Bcl-XL (11Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25865-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Zhou X.M. Liu Y.M. Payne G. Lutz R.J. Chittenden T. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 10: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation on Ser-112 and Ser-136, which are located outside the BH3 domain, may inhibit dimerization with Bcl-XL indirectly, perhaps by promoting associations with 14-3-3 proteins. Here we have shown that mimicking phosphorylation at either Ser-170 or at Ser-112 by mutation to Asp is not sufficient to disrupt Bad/Bcl-XL complexes. Thus, although the Bad S170D mutants do not induce apoptosis, the protein can still associate with Bcl-XL. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of the different Bad mutants using confocal microscopy did not reveal striking differences between wild-type Bad, Bad S170A, and S170D (data not shown). The significance of Bad phosphorylated at Ser-170 remaining associated with Bcl-XL remains to be determined, but other possible models will have to be considered. For example, phosphorylation at Ser-170 may serve as a novel docking site for another protein that may modulate pro-survival activity of the protein complex.The other factor that remains to be characterized is the kinase responsible for phosphorylation at the Ser-170 site. Our previous results suggest that neither activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/MAPK nor the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways is responsible for phosphorylation at the site that we have now shown to be Ser-170 (24Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A search for potential kinases that can phosphorylate Ser-170 (using NetPhos) reveals protein kinase A or calmodulin kinase II as candidates. Protein kinase A has been implicated in phosphorylation of Bad (12Zhou X.M. Liu Y.M. Payne G. Lutz R.J. Chittenden T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25046-25051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Lizcano J.M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for protein kinase A phosphorylation is RXXS, which fits with the sequence PRPKS at Ser-170, but the two prolines make this an unlikely protein kinase A site. Preliminary experiments have not revealed any role for cAMP in stimulating Bad phosphorylation in MC/9 cells (data not shown). The possibility of a calmodulin-dependent kinase acting in the hemopoietic cell system in response to cytokines is also unlikely since cytokines are not known to induce a calcium flux. Clearly, identification of the kinase(s) that phosphorylates Bad at Ser-170 will enhance our understanding of cytokine-dependent survival signals. It will also be important to determine the temporal sequence of the phosphorylation events in various cell types expressing Bad. Datta et al. (13Datta S.R. Katsov A., Hu, L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) propose that phosphorylation of the Ser-136 site may precede phosphorylation of Ser-155 and perhaps affects Bad so that it can be phosphorylated at Ser-155. Phosphorylation at Ser-170 could play a similar role, although our results with the Bad S170D mutant suggest that phosphorylation at Ser-170 still allows Bad association with Bcl-XL. Efforts to identify the kinase that phosphorylates Ser-170 as well as other possible studies investigating the role of Ser-170 in the function of Bad will be greatly facilitated by the availability of a phospho-specific antibody, which is currently in preparation.In summary, we have characterized a fourth site of phosphorylation on the BH3-only Bcl-2 family member, Bad. In assays using three different cell lines, it was clear that mutations at the newly characterized Ser-170 site had a profound effect on the pro-apoptotic effect of Bad. In our initial characterization of this phosphorylation event, even cytokine-dependent MC/9 cells starved of cytokine retained some phosphorylation at the Ser-170 site. Phosphorylation at this site was enhanced with cytokine stimulation, and together with our mutational analysis, the results suggest that phosphorylation at Ser-170 plays a key role in the function of Bad. Regulation of the various phosphorylation sites on Bad reveals a degree of complexity that was unexpected. All these sites may be regulated differently depending on the cell type, and the role of one particular site with respect to the others may vary as well, which could explain the differences in the effect of Bad expression in various cell types. Furthermore, the various sites appear to have very different effects. Phosphorylation at Ser-112 or Ser-136 promotes Bad association with 14-3-3. The Ser-155 site serves to prevent association of Bad with Bcl-XL. Finally, we speculate that phosphorylation at Ser-170 on Bad, although it is still associated with Bcl-XL, may enhance the survival effect of Bcl-XL and also impart a growth-promoting effect. It is clear that the many sites of phosphorylation on Bad serve to make this protein a key player in the complex cellular events involving apoptosis and perhaps in regulation of cell cycle progression. Bcl-2 family proteins have emerged as key players in the regulation of apoptosis in many types of cells (for review, see Refs. 1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholarand 2Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Whereas some members prevent cell death (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1), others exhibit pro-apoptotic activity (Bax, Bak, Bok). The balance between these two groups can be disrupted by a third group of proteins that share at least one common structural motif, a short α-helical region termed the BH3 domain. BH3-only members include Bad, Bim, Bik, Bid, Noxa, and Hrk (3Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 4Oda E. Ohki R.

The model that prevails suggests that BH3-only proteins act in response to death-inducing signals and function to neutralize pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins by heterodimerization, freeing the Bax-like proteins to execute cell death (2Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 5Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr.

This requires linear signals to be rectified and then summed in temporal order to compute direction. Although both operations have been attributed to cortex, rectification might occur in retina, prior to the ganglion cell. Here we show that the Y ganglion cell does indeed respond to spatiotemporal contrast modulations of a second-order motion stimulus. Responses in an OFF ganglion cell are caused by an EPSP/IPSP sequence evoked from within the dendritic field; in ON cells inhibition is indirect. Inhibitory effects, which are blocked by tetrodotoxin, clamp the response near resting potential thus preventing saturation. Apparently the computation for second-order motion can be initiated by Y cells and completed by cortical cells that sum outputs of multiple Y cells in a directionally selective manner."

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of a single ubiquitin moiety (monoubiquitylation) has been implicated in receptor endocytosis (4Hicke L.

In addition, protein modification by the ubiquitin-like proteins SUMO and Nedd8 has been found to have a wide range of functions, from control of subcellular localization to modulation of protein stability (8Jentsch S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation occurs at lysine residues, either within target proteins or on ubiquitin already attached to the target protein, and involves three distinct enzymatic activities. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)1 activates ubiquitin to a high energy state in an ATP-dependent manner and then transfers it to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). The E2 either can transfer ubiquitin directly to the target substrate or interact with a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3), which then mediates the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (10Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). There are two major classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Those containing a RING finger motif act in concert with E2 enzymes in the direct transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the target protein (11Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Members of the second class of E3 ubiquitin ligases accept activated ubiquitin from the E2 and transfer it to substrate proteins. The first identified member of this class is E6-AP, which mediates polyubiquitylation of p53 in conjunction with human papillomavirus E6 protein (12Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar, 13Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Other members of this family include Nedd4 and related Nedd4-like proteins (14Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These all have a carboxyl-terminal region known as the HECT (for homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain, which provides the ubiquitin ligase enzymatic activity. Unlike E6-AP, members of the Nedd4 family have two to four tryptophan-based WW domains, which bind certain proteins containing proline-rich motifs (Fig. 1A). The WW domains of Nedd4 have been categorized as group I, which bind preferentially to the consensus sequence PPXY (PY domain) (15Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Group II WW domains typically bind to the sequence PPLP (16Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas a third class is able to bind other proline-rich consensus sequences (17Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The fourth class of WW domains binds in a proline-independent manner, depending instead on phosphoserine and/or phosphothreonine residues (18Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The best-characterized Nedd4 substrate is the epithelial sodium channel, a plasma membrane protein composed of several subunits, two of which are ubiquitylated by Nedd4. The WW domains of Nedd4 bind to PY domains in the cytoplasmic region of these proteins. Truncation of the PY domains results in a reduced turnover rate of epithelial sodium channel and leads to Liddle's syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension (19Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar,20Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Nedd4 was identified originally as a gene expressed at high levels in neural precursor cells during development and subsequently down-regulated in the adult (21Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Nedd4 also is expressed at high levels in proliferating chondrocytes in mid-gestation embryos (22Weston A.D. Underhill T.M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These sites of expression suggest an important role for Nedd4 in regulating developmentally important gene function at the level of protein half-life. Indeed, the actions of two Nedd4-like proteins, Suppressor of Deltex and Smurf1, are consistent with such a role during development. Smurf1 mediates polyubiquitylation of Smad1, a mediator of bone morphogenetic protein signaling (24Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H.

However, the specific functions of Nedd4 itself in developmental processes are unknown, in part because of the fact that very few developmentally expressed ubiquitylation substrates have been characterized (27Pham N. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46995-47003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr.

Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, we searched for proteins expressed in the mid-gestation embryo that interact with Nedd4 in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and further characterized these to determine their functional interaction with Nedd4 both in vitro and in vivo. We have identified four proteins, which we designated asNedd4binding partners 1–4 (N4BP1–4). We demonstrate here that N4BP1 and N4BP2, both novel proteins, have the capacity to be ubiquitylation substrates. N4BP1 is abona fide substrate for Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase activityin vivo, and the first identified nonviral target for Nedd4-mediated monoubiquitylation. N4BP3, also a novel protein, is not a ubiquitylation substrate, but it can alter the subcellular location of Nedd4, indicating a functional interaction. A fragment of mouse Nedd4 cDNA encoding amino acids 199–777 cloned into the GAL4 binding domain vector pGBT9, and an 11-day mouse embryo cDNA library cloned into the GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD10 were sequentially used to transform Hf7c yeast cells according to the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Transformants were plated on selection media (lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine) containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. After incubating 10 days at 30 °C, clones expressing HIS3 and β-galactosidase (β-gal) were identified. Plasmids were recovered according to MATCHMAKER protocols, and transformed into yeast containing either pGBT9-Nedd4 or the pGBT9 empty vector. Inserts from plasmids that activated GAL4 transcription with pGBT9-Nedd4 were excised from pGAD10 and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in frame with the Xpress and 6-histidine (His) epitope tags. A full-length N4BP1 expression vector was made in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by assembling the original clone with mouse EST AA444325 and a fragment containing the 5′ part of the coding region, produced by PCR using a N4BP1 genomic cosmid clone as template. KIAA0341, a human full-length cDNA homologous to N4BP3, was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute as a pBluescript clone. The insert was removed and subcloned into pCDNA3.1. Site-directed mutagenesis of the proline-rich sites in full-length mouse N4BP1 and KIAA0341 was done using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All Nedd4 GST fusion constructs used in this study were described previously (29Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). They were generated using the pGEX GST Gene Fusion System (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen, Madison, WI). The E1 from wheat cloned in pET3a and human UbcH5B cloned in pET15b were expressed in E. coli BL21 using the pET expression system (Novagen) as described previously (29Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In vitro expression and radiolabeling of proteins was performed by coupled transcription and translation using the TnT wheat germ extract kit (Promega, Madison, WI), in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To produce antisera against N4BP1 (anti-N4BP1), the insert was subcloned from pGAD10 into theEcoRI site of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and expressed in BL21 cells. Recombinant fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose, and ∼100 μg was injected into rabbits at 3-week intervals. Nedd4 GST fusion proteins (GST-Nedd4, GST-Nedd4:N, and GST-Nedd4:C) were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads and then combined with each N4BP protein or E6-AP, which had beenin vitro translated and 35S-labeled, in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with 2 mg/ml BSA. Mixtures were incubated 20 h at 4 °C with agitation and then washed four times with five volumes of binding buffer to remove unbound proteins. Bound protein was eluted by boiling in reducing sample buffer, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. N4BP proteins, in vitrotranslated and radiolabeled as above, were incubated in the presence of GST-Nedd4, BL21 bacterial extracts of wheat E1and human UbcH5b, and ubiquitin, in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 120 mmNaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phosphocreatine, 100 units of creatine phosphokinase, 0.6 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 5 mm ATPγS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with the addition of SDS-containing reducing sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were made using the calcium phosphate method. After 24–48 h, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation, and the cleared supernatant was either analyzed directly by Western blotting or used for immunoprecipitations. For N4BP1 immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with anti-N4BP1 polyclonal antisera. For N4BP2 and N4BP3 immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-Xpress or anti-HisG monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitates were collected by incubating with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for an additional 1 h. After brief centrifugation, the complexes were washed three times with ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins were recovered by boiling in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Novex, San Diego, CA). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBS and incubated for 2 h with the different primary antibodies diluted in TBS. Antibody dilutions used were: anti-N4BP1, 1:2000 dilution; anti-Nedd4, 1:1000; anti-Xpress and anti-HisG, 1:2000; and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), 1:1000. After incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Pierce). After washing with TBST, chemiluminescent detection was performed using Supersignal (Pierce). For proteasome inhibition, stock solutions of MG101 (calpain inhibitor I), lactacystin, MG132, and epoxomycin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were prepared in Me2SO and diluted immediately before use in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to final concentrations of 100 μm for MG101, 5 μm for lactacystin, 10 μm for MG132, and 5 μm for epoxomycin. HEK293 cells were plated on glass coverslips, transiently transfected, and, 24 h later, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS, incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted in 0.1% BSA in PBS, washed in PBS, and further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Pierce) for 1 h. N4BP1 was detected with anti-N4BP1 antiserum used at 1:400 dilution. His-tagged N4BP2 and N4BP3 were detected with anti-HisG monoclonal antibody used at 1:5000 dilution. HA-tagged Nedd4 was detected with either anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA) at 1:1000 dilution or anti-Nedd4 polyclonal antiserum at 1:1000 dilution. After incubation with secondary antibodies, samples were mounted in ProLong (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) plus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, observed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope, and imaged with a SPOT2 digital camera. To identify potential Nedd4 ubiquitylation substrates that might play a role in embryo development, a fragment of Nedd4 containing WW domains 2 and 3 and the HECT domain (Fig.1B) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mid-gestation mouse embryo cDNA library. From 7 × 106 clones screened, four interacting clones were identified. These were designated N4BP1–4 (Fig. 2). N4BP4 encodes an amino-terminally truncated form of PLIC-2 (Fig. 2D), a protein recently characterized as a regulator of the interaction between the proteasome and ubiquitin ligases (30Kleijnen M.F. Shih A.H. Zhou P. Kumar S. Soccio R.E. Kedersha N.L. Gill G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). N4BP1–3 show no similarity to proteins with known functions. Taking advantage of overlapping ESTs and, in the case of N4BP1, a genomic clone that we isolated covering the 5′ region of the gene, the full-length open reading frames encoded by N4BP1 and N4BP3 were deduced (Fig. 2,A and C). For clarity these are referred to as flN4BP1 and flN4BP3, respectively. For N4BP1–3, amino acid sequences of full-length human orthologs were found or deduced. For flN4BP1, the 893-amino acid human protein KIAA0615 was found to have 89% similarity. N4PB2 was found to be 92% similar to the carboxyl region of a full-length open reading frame encoding 1770 amino acids assembled from KIAA1413 and EST AK001542. flN4BP3 was found to be 95% similar to KIAA0341. To confirm the yeast two-hybrid results, N4BP1–4 were in vitro translated and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine. These were then evaluated for binding to glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized bacterially expressed GST-Nedd4 fusion proteins that included either both the WW and HECT domains (GST-Nedd4; Fig. 1C), the WW domain-containing region only (GST-Nedd4:N; Fig. 1D) or the HECT domain only (GST-Nedd4:C; Fig. 1E). N4BP1 bound to both GST-Nedd4 (Fig.3A, lane 2) and GST-Nedd4:N (Fig. 3A, lane 3). There was little detectable binding to GST-Nedd4:C (Fig. 3A, lane 4) or to a non-WW domain HECT E3, E6AP, which was used as an additional negative control (Fig. 3A, lane 6). Because regions within the amino-terminal half of Nedd4 were used in the two-hybrid screen, in vitro binding to GST-Nedd4:N serves to validate the interaction in yeast. Similar results were found for N4BP2 (Fig. 3B) and for N4BP3 and its full-length human counterpart KIAA0341 (Fig. 3C). However, no binding to N4BP4 (Plic-2 carboxyl terminus) was observed. Therefore, no further studies were carried out with this potential binding partner. Nedd4 can bind other proteins through the interaction of its WW domains with proline-rich domains in target proteins. Thus, identification of proline-rich regions in N4BP proteins may provide clues for their interaction with Nedd4. In fact, N4BP1 contains a PY motif (PPEY) and two PPLP motifs. Strikingly, however, none of these three regions are conserved in the human ortholog (KIAA0615). N4BP3 also contains a consensus PY motif (PPPY), and this sequence is conserved in the corresponding region of KIAA0341. In the case of N4BP2, neither this isolate nor the corresponding region of the human ortholog has an identifiable WW interaction domain. N4BP4 (PLIC-2) also lacks proline-rich regions. The lack of conservation of the proline-rich regions between N4BP1 and its human counterpart raises the possibility that these domains are not required for the interaction with Nedd4. To address this, key residues in the PY domain and two PPLP domains (PPLP1 and PPLP2; Fig. 2A) of N4BP1 were mutated. As shown in Fig.3E, these mutations had no discernable effect on N4BP1 binding to Nedd4. Thus the interaction between Nedd4 and N4BP1 is, in fact, independent of these proline-rich regions. Conversely, mutation of the evolutionarily conserved PY domain in the human ortholog of N4BP3 (KIAA0341) dramatically decreased Nedd4 binding (Fig.3F), establishing that the binding of this protein to Nedd4 is dependent on interactions between the Nedd4 WW domains and the proline-rich region of N4BP3. As N4BP1–3 all bind Nedd4, we next addressed their capacity to serve asin vitro substrates for this E3. In the presence of GST-Nedd4, ubiquitin, and E1 and E2 enzyme activities, N4BP1 was ubiquitylated as indicated by the ubiquitin and E2-dependent appearance of discrete higher molecular weight species (Fig. 4A, lane 2, bracketed). Under the same conditions N4BP2 underwent what appeared to be polyubiquitylation, as demonstrated by the appearance of a smear of higher molecular weight bands that extended up the gel accompanied by a significant decrease in the amount of the non-ubiquitylated form of this protein (Fig. 4B,lane 2, bracketed). Again, this was dependent on the presence of E1, E2, and ubiquitin (Fig. 4, A andB, lanes 1, 3, 4, and5). In contrast, full-length human N4BP3 (KIAA0341) was not ubiquitylated despite its clear capacity to bind Nedd4 (Fig.4C, lane 2). To extend the in vitro observations to cells, eukaryotic expression vectors encoding flN4BP1, N4BP2, or the full-length human N4BP3 (KIAA0341) were co-transfected with Nedd4 into HEK293 cells and evaluated for co-immunoprecipitation with Nedd4. Immunoprecipitation of N4BP1 was performed using antiserum derived against bacterially expressed protein (anti-N4BP1). N4BP2 and KIAA0341 were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies directed against their amino-terminal His and Xpress epitope tags. No co-immunoprecipitation of Nedd4 with N4BP1 was detected (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–3), despite clear evidence for expression of this protein (Fig.5B, lanes 1–3). In contrast, in vivoassociation of N4BP2 and KIAA0341 could be discerned readily (Fig.5A, lanes 5 and 7). Although there was less Nedd4 co-immunoprecipitated with N4BP2 than with KIAA0341, the expression level achieved in the transfection was much lower for N4BP2 than for KIAA0341 (compare lanes 5 and 7 in Fig.5B). Thus, the level of interaction with Nedd4 may be similar for these two proteins. Consistent with the in vitrobinding data, mutation of the PY domain in KIAA0341 resulted in a dramatic decrease of co-immunoprecipitated Nedd4 (Fig. 5A,lane 9), underscoring the importance of the PY domain for interactions between this protein and Nedd4. The failure to see co-immunoprecipitation of Nedd4 and N4BP1 does not preclude a functionally significant in vivo interaction. To evaluate this, N4BP1 ubiquitylation was analyzed in HEK293 cells. When we co-transfected flN4BP1 with a Myc epitope-tagged ubiquitin expression vector (31Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a single Myc-ubiquitin immunoreactive band could be detected after immunoprecipitation with anti-N4BP1 (Fig.6A, lane 3). Its mobility was consistent with its being a monoubiquitylated form of flN4BP1. Strikingly, co-transfection with a Nedd4 expression vector resulted in a marked increase in monoubiquitylated flN4BP1 (Fig.6A, lane 4), despite the fact that the total N4BP1 protein was equivalent in all lanes, as assessed by immunoblotting with anti-N4BP1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–4). Thus, these results indicate a functional interaction between Nedd4 and N4BP1 in vivo. To assess in vivo ubiquitylation of N4BP2 and N4BP3, His- and Xpress-tagged forms of N4BP2 and N4BP3 were co-expressed with Myc-tagged ubiquitin in HEK293 cells. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-His antibody and Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody, multiple high molecular weight forms could easily be discerned for N4BP2 (Fig.7A, lanes 1 and2 showing duplicate samples). In contrast, no such forms were detected for N4BP3 (data not shown). To assess whether Nedd4 mediates N4BP2 polyubiquitylation in vivo, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Nedd4, N4BP2, and Myc-tagged ubiquitin expression vectors. No discernable change in N4BP2 polyubiquitylation was detected (Fig. 7A, lanes 3 and 4 showing duplicate samples) despite clear overexpression of Nedd4 (Fig.7C, lanes 3 and 4) compared with control transfections (Fig. 7C, lanes 1 and2). Equal loading was verified by reblotting with anti-Xpress antibody (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 and4). Overexpression of Nedd4 also did not result in any detectable ubiquitylation of N4BP3 (data not shown). These data correlate with the in vitro ubiquitylation results, in which N4BP2 was polyubiquitylated and N4BP3 was not ubiquitylated at all. However, there is no evidence that Nedd4 mediates N4BP3 polyubiquitylation in vivo. Because proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation are generally modified with chains of four or more ubiquitins, we reasoned that N4BP2 but not N4BP1 might be degraded by the proteasome. To assess this, we determined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on steady state levels of N4BP1 and N4BP2 expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig.8). The steady state level of N4BP1, as determined by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with anti-N4BP1 antiserum, was not affected by any treatment (Fig. 8A). In contrast, following treatment with different proteasome inhibitors and immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-Xpress, a significant increase in N4BP2 steady state levels was found (Fig. 8B, bands marked by asterisk). Notably, levels of co-transfected Xpress-tagged β-gal, a stable protein insensitive to proteasome inhibition used as a control, were unaffected (Fig. 8B,arrow). Thus N4BP2, which is modified by multiple ubiquitin moieties both in cells and in vitro, is subject to proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas N4BP1, which demonstrates a low stoichiometry of ubiquitylation in vitro and Nedd4-mediated monoubiquitylation in cells, is not proteasome-degraded. The functional interaction between N4BP1 and Nedd4 in vivo, despite the lack of co-immunoprecipitation, prompted us to determine the subcellular location of N4BP1 and Nedd4 in transfected HEK293 cells using immunofluorescence. In all transfected cells, N4BP1 was organized into discrete circular structures, which were mainly located in the nucleus and varied in number and size from cell to cell (Fig.9, A and B). In cells with high levels of transfected protein, there was also diffuse staining in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In contrast, Nedd4 was found mostly throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 9, C andD), as reported previously (29Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the N4BP1 and Nedd4 expression vectors did not alter the subcellular localization of either protein (Fig. 9, E–G). This small degree of overlap (Fig. 9H) may underlie the failure to detect co-immunoprecipitation. We also examined the subcellular location of transfected N4BP2 and N4BP3 in HEK293 cells. N4BP2 was found in an even distribution throughout the cytoplasm, similar to Nedd4 (Fig. 9I). However, in cells co-transfected with Nedd4, there was some redistribution of N4BP2 and Nedd4 into aggregates (Fig. 9,J–L). Transfected N4BP3 was also cytoplasmic, but was localized in vesicles of a wide range of sizes distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 9, M and N). In cells co-transfected with Nedd4"

We have developed a mRNA-dependent cell-free system that recapitulates US2- and US11-mediated degradation of MHC class I heavy chains. Microsomes support the degradation of MHC class I heavy chains in the presence of US2 or US11 in a cytosol-dependent manner. In vitro, the glycosylated heavy chain is exported from the microsomes. A deglycosylated breakdown intermediate of the heavy chain identical to that generated in intact cells accumulates in soluble form in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Microsomes derived from the U373 astrocytoma cell line are far more effective than canine-derived membranes in supporting this US2- or US11-dependent reaction. In contrast, the HIV-encoded Vpu membrane protein can cause the destruction of CD4 from either human- or canine-derived membranes. Using the in vitro system, we show that a truncation mutant of US2 that lacks the cytosolic domain is unable to catalyze degradation, whereas a similar truncation of US11 continues to catalyze degradation of class I heavy chains. Therefore, US2 requires both transmembrane and cytosolic interactions to trigger dislocation of heavy chains, whereas US11 relies on the transmembrane domain to target heavy chains. US2 and US11 thus utilize different targeting mechanisms for class I degradation."

However, in the course of evolution products of lipid peroxidation have also acquired a physiological function: they signal the presence of an oxidative insult and trigger an appropriate cellular response.

It has been recently shown that Alpha-class GSTs contribute the majority of activity for phospholipid hydroperoxides, at least in some cells (10Zhao T. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J. Pandya U.

Early stress response is characterized by increased lipid peroxidation and by induction of an Alpha-class GST that conjugates 4-HNE (15Cheng J.-Z. Sharma R. Yang Y. Singhal S.S. Sharma A. Saini M.K.

Thus, Alpha-class GSTs play a key role in the catabolism of lipid peroxidation products. Lipid peroxidation products either reside in membranes (phospholipid hydroperoxides) or partition into membranes to a significant degree (4-HNE). Strikingly, the Alpha-class GSTs responsible for the majority of the metabolism of these compounds were not thought to be associated with membranes. GSTs are ubiquitous enzymes with diverse functions (16Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 17Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J.

At least three structurally unrelated groups of these enzymes arose through convergent evolution: the canonical soluble GSTs, microsomal GSTs, and the bacterial fosfomycin resistance protein (19Armstrong R.N.

The subcellular localization of the canonical GSTs, which include the major mammalian Alpha, Mu, and Pi classes, has been studied in several tissues (22Sundberg A.G. Nilsson R. Appelkvist E.L.

The enzymes are present mainly in the cytosol. For several GSTs, especially of the Pi class, nuclear localization has also been reported (22Sundberg A.G. Nilsson R. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G.

Mitochondrial localization has been reported for hGSTA4-4 (28Gardner J.L. Gallagher E.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and for rGSTA4-4 (27Bhagwat S.V. Vijayasarathy C. Raza H. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), enzymes involved in the metabolism of lipid peroxidation products (29Jensson H. Guthenberg C. Alin P. Mannervik B.

The goal of the present study was to examine the subcellular localization of mGSTA4-4, a GST with high activity for both 4-HNE and phospholipid hydroperoxides, and thus to address the apparent paradox of an incongruent localization of an enzyme and its substrate(s). Our results demonstrate that mGSTA4-4 is enriched at or near the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and transfected hepatoma cells, a localization likely to facilitate its access to substrates and thus its biological function. Furthermore, through site-directed mutagenesis followed by transfection and in vitro binding experiments, we elucidated the mechanism by which mGSTA4-4 associates with membranes and identified the amino acid residues (predominantly lysine 115) responsible for the binding. Vectors for constitutive mammalian cell expression of the following proteins were used in the course of the present work. (i) Wild-type mGSTA4-4: the coding sequence of murine mGSTA4-4 (31Zimniak P.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pRC-CMV/mGSTA4. (ii) mGSTA4-4(K115E): the AAG codon encoding K115 in vector pRC-CMV/mGSTA4 was mutated to GAG using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). (iii) Mitochondrially targeted mGSTA4-4: DNA encoding the 24-amino acid mitochondrial targeting sequence of human ornithine transcarbamoylase (Ref. 35Horwich A.L. Fenton W.A. Williams K.R.

Fenton, Yale University) was amplified by PCR introducing the following two modifications. 1) To create a downstreamNdeI site needed for subsequent in-frame ligation, the last codon of the leader signal was changed from AAT (Asn) to CAT (His). 2) To convert the suboptimal Kozak consensus sequence of the original ornithine transcarbamoylase clone to the canonical sequence GCC ACCATG G (initiator codon underlined; Ref. 36Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), which contains G in position +4, an additional codon (GCC encoding Ala) was inserted downstream of the initiator ATG. This increased the length of the signal peptide to 25 amino acids but retained Leu (originally in position 2, now in position 3 of the protein) which is part of the amphiphilic structure of the targeting peptide. The resulting fragment was ligated in frame to the 5′-end of a mGSTA4 cDNA previously mutated to contain a NdeI site at the initiator codon (31Zimniak P. Singhal S.S. Srivastava S.K. Awasthi S. Sharma R. Hayden J.B. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 992-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the entire coding sequence was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3. The resulting pcDNA3/mito(25aaOTC)-mGSTA4 construct was verified by sequencing. HepG2 were transfected with the three expression vectors or with control (insert-free) plasmid, and the resulting transfectants were characterized biochemically as described previously (33Zimniak L. Awasthi S. Srivastava S.K. Zimniak P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 143: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34He N.G. Singhal S.S. Srivastava S.K. Zimniak P. Awasthi Y.C. Awasthi S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression vector pET-9a/mGSTA4 was described previously (31Zimniak P. Singhal S.S.

The plasmid was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to obtain the desired variants of codons 115 and/or 112. Wild-type mGSTA4-4 and its mutants (K115E, K115R, K115Q, K112C, and K112C/K115E) were then expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Vector pET-11d/mGSTA1 (37Xia H. Pan S.S. Hu X. Srivastava S.K. Pal A. Singh S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. S. V. Singh, University of Pittsburgh. The corresponding protein, mGSTA1-1, was expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3). Human hGSTA4-4 was expressed in E. coliBL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) from vector pET-30a(+)/hGSTA4(silmut1–15) as described previously (38Cheng J.Z. Yang Y. Singh S.P. Singhal S.S. Awasthi S.

All GSTs were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography essentially according to Ref. 39Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. All bacterially expressed GSTs, including the mutants of mGSTA4-4, were assayed for activity with a model substrate (CDNB) and with the electrophilic lipid peroxidation product 4-HNE. GST activities were measured spectrophotometrically in a microtiter plate reader (SPECTRAmax Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Activity with CDNB was measured at 25 °C according to Ref. 39Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. 4-HNE activity was determined at 30 °C as described in Ref. 40Alin P. Danielson U.H. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar. Polyclonal antibodies against affinity-purified mGSTA4-4 and hGSTA4-4 were raised in chicken. The IgY fraction (corresponding to mammalian IgG) was obtained from egg yolks by polyethylene glycol precipitation (41Polson A. Immunol. Invest. 1990; 19: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Control IgY was purified by the same protocol from preimmune eggs. Anti-hGSTA1-1 (cross-reacting with mGSTA1-1) was raised in rabbits as described previously (42Ahmad H. Singh S.V. Medh R.D. Ansari G.A.S. Kurosky A. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the IgG fraction was purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. Specificity of all antibodies was established by Western blotting using authentic purified GSTs. Confluent monolayers of HepG2 cells on glass coverslips were rinsed with Dulbecco's PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min. The permeabilization and blocking of nonspecific binding sites were performed in one step by incubating the monolayers with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (Goldmark Biologicals, Phillipsburg, NJ), and 5% normal goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) (buffer PBG) for 45 min. Monolayers were then incubated with anti-mGSTA4-4 chicken IgY (1:100 in PBS supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin) overnight at room temperature, followed by extensive washing with PBS. For control of nonspecific binding, preimmune chicken IgY at 1:100 dilution was substituted for the anti-mGSTA4-4 antibody. Monolayers were subsequently incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG (1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min, postfixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS containing 0.2% p-phenylenediamine as an anti-photobleaching agent. The monolayers were examined using an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope equipped with DeltaVision PC 4.08 g deconvolution system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Images were reconstructed in XY and XZ planes using MetaMorph software (version 3.5, Universal Images, West Chester, PA). The mitochondrial localization of mGSTA4-4 fused to an ornithine transcarbamoylase mitochondrial-targeting signal was confirmed by co-localization studies with the mitochondria-specific fluorophore MitoTracker Orange (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stably transfected HepG2 cells cultured on glass coverslips were rinsed with PBS twice, and incubated with standard culture medium containing 0.2 μm MitoTracker Orange for 15 min at 37 °C. The monolayers were then rinsed twice with PBS and fixed and immunolabeled for mGSTA4-4 as described above. Co-localization was examined using Olympus IX 70 equipped with a DeltaVision deconvolution system. The signal from Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (for mGSTA4-4) was collected using 490/20 nm and 528/36 nm excitation/emission band pass filters, and the signal from MitoTracker Orange was collected using the 555/28 nm and 617/73 nm band pass filter set. Neutral density filters were applied to reduce the leak of the fluorescence signal in either direction to undetectable levels. Swiss-Webster mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and small cubes of liver were excised and immediately placed in ice-cold fixative (3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4). Following fixation for 4 h, tissue blocks were rinsed with PBS, immersed in Optimum Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura, Torrance, CA) overnight at 4 °C, cryopreserved in liquid N2, and sectioned. The 5-μm cryosections were immunolabeled for mGSTA4-4 using essentially the same approach as described above for HepG2 cells with the exception that the permeabilization/blocking step was performed for 2 h. Liposomes (small unilamellar vesicles, SUV) from asolectin (crude soybean phospholipids; Associated Concentrates, Woodside, NY, or Sigma, cat. no. P3644) were prepared by swelling 50 mg of unpurified asolectin in 1 ml of water under nitrogen for 1 h with intermittent shaking at room temperature followed by exhaustive sonication in a cylindrical bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies, Hicksville, NY) under nitrogen. To prepare liposomes of defined lipid composition, cholesterol (3 parts by weight), phosphatidylcholine (from bovine brain, Sigma; 5 parts), and phosphatidylethanolamine (from soybean, Sigma; 2 parts) with or without acidic phospholipids (1 part) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1). The following acidic phospholipids, all from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, were used: dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine (from brain), dioleoylphosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol (from plant sources), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (from brain), and tetraoleoyl cardiolipin. The solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were hydrated and sonicated as described for asolectin. Binding of GSTs to liposomes was measured by incubating 1 mg of liposomes with 15 μg of protein for 30 min at room temperature in 0.5 ml of 100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Liposome-bound and free protein were separated by loading the entire incubation mixture onto a 1 × 50-cm Sephadex G-200 superfine column equilibrated and eluted with the above buffer. Peaks were pooled, evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac, and dissolved in 1 ml of water, and the material was delipidated by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by washing the pellet with ethanol and ether. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and the blots were probed with antibodies against the respective GST. Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) and fluorescence detection were used for visualization and quantitation of bands on a Storm 860 imager (Molecular Dynamics). Known amounts of bacterially expressed GSTs were loaded on the same gel. The calibration curve constructed by quantitation of bands resulting from the standards was used to determine the amounts of liposome-associated and free GSTs, whose loading amount was adjusted to be within the range of the calibration curve. Immunostaining of frozen sections of mouse liver with an anti-mGSTA4-4 antibody revealed a localization of the enzyme predominantly at the plasma membrane of the hepatocytes (Fig. 1A). Some labeling was also present within discrete areas of the cytoplasm, but no significant diffuse cytoplasmic labeling was observed in any of the examined preparations. Interestingly, the plasma membrane was labeled to a similar degree regardless of the membrane domain, i.e.apical (canalicular) versus basolateral. No significant labeling was observed in liver sections incubated with preimmune chicken IgY (Fig. 1B). The microscopic analysis of the mGSTA4-4-transfected HepG2 cells revealed that ∼40% of all cells exhibited a strong and specific fluorescent signal from mGSTA4-4. The majority of mGSTA4-4 was localized to the plasma membrane and, to a lesser degree, to the narrow zone of adjacent cytoplasm (Fig.2A). Analysis of images reconstructed in the XZ plane (Fig. 2B) confirmed the above-mentioned localization of mGSTA4-4 in transfected HepG2 cells. The specificity of the immunostaining was demonstrated by the absence of fluorescent signal in monolayers in which the anti-mGSTA4-4 antibody was replaced with preimmune chicken IgY (Fig. 2C). Further confirmation of the specificity of immunolabeling was obtained from cells expressing mGSTA4-4 fused to a mitochondrial-targeting peptide. As expected, in these cells the majority of mGSTA4-4 was localized to discrete intracytoplasmic structures relatively homogeneously distributed within the perinuclear cytoplasm (Fig.3A). The fluorescent signal from the majority of these particles co-localized with mitochondria labeled with MitoTracker Orange (Fig. 3, B andC). Importantly, neither labeling of the plasma membrane nor diffuse cytoplasmic staining was observed in these cells, which confirmed the high specificity of the anti-GST antibody used in these studies. Some cells expressed very little of the transfected mGSTA4-4. In these cells, no immunolabeling with mGSTA4-4 antibody was detected, whereas the typical mitochondrial staining pattern was still observed (Fig. 3C, asterisks). In contrast to the transfected cells described above, no detectable immunostaining was observed in control HepG2 cells transfected with insert-free vector (data not shown). The intracellular distribution of the mGSTA4-4(K115E) mutant was distinctively different from that observed in HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type protein. The mutated protein was diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm, and no preferential targeting to intracellular organelles or plasma membrane was observed (Fig.4). This diffuse cytoplasmic distribution was observed in the XY as well as in the XZ planes of the HepG2 cells (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). This observation suggested that lysine 115 is critically important for the plasma membrane targeting of the protein. In agreement with the membrane association of mGSTA4-4 observed microscopically in intact cells, the enzyme had the ability to bind to phospholipid (asolectin) liposomes (Fig.5). Under the conditions used, approximately half of mGSTA4-4 associated with the vesicles. Although true binding constants were not measured, the ratio of bound to free protein (used as the binding parameter in Fig. 5) constitutes an apparent binding constant. This is justified because the vesicle surface is in large excess compared with the protein. Thus, the concentration of free liposomal binding sites will remain constant for all GSTs tested, and can be subsumed into the apparent (composite) binding constant. The conclusion that liposomal binding surface in excess over GST protein was reached as follows. Under the experimental conditions used, the protein concentration was 0.6 μm, and the approximate concentration of liposomes was 0.4–0.5 μm (as determined from an average radius of SUVs of 14.9 nm (43Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Sugishita K. Yoneyama S. Akada K. Ueha M. Nakamura A. Kobayashi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), a membrane thickness of 3 nm, and an average surface requirement of 0.71 nm2 per phospholipid molecule (44Engelman D.M. Nature. 1969; 223: 1279-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), or from the experimentally obtained internal volume of SUVs of ∼1 μl/mg lipid). Given that the cross-section of a mGSTA4-4 molecule is less than 40 nm2 (on the basis of crystal structures; Refs.45Krengel U. Schroter K.H. Hoier H. Arkema A. Kalk K.H. Zimniak P. Dijkstra B.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 46Xiao B. Singh S.P. Nanduri B. Awasthi Y.C. Zimniak P. Ji X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11887-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the surface of a SUV is ∼3000 nm2, less than 2% of the total surface of liposomes is occupied by protein. It should also be noted that the dissociation of mGSTA4-4 from its complex with liposomes is slow because discrete peaks of bound and free protein (as opposed to a smear) are obtained on Sephadex gel filtration, which requires several hours to complete. Loss of plasma membrane association of the mGSTA4-4(K115E) mutant in transfected cells suggested that lysine 115 may play a role in the mechanism involved in the targeting and/or binding of the enzyme to the plasma membrane. To verify this hypothesis we examined the binding of mGSTA4-4(K115E) to liposomes in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5, membrane association of the mutant enzyme was significantly reduced as compared with the wild-type protein. In contrast, binding was preserved in mGSTA4-4(K115R) and was intermediate in mGSTA4-4(K115Q), indicating that a positive charge on the amino acid side chain in position 115 favors binding, whereas a negative charge counteracts binding. The effect was position-specific because the elimination of a positive charge in position 112 in the mGSTA4-4(K112C) mutant did not affect b"

We demonstrate that amino-terminal domains of the yeast MutL homologs Mlh1 and Pms1 required for DNA mismatch repair both possess independent, intrinsic ATPase activities. Amino acid substitutions in the conserved ATP binding sites concomitantly reduce ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and DNA mismatch repair in vivo. The ATPase activities are weak, consistent with the hypothesis that ATP binding is primarily responsible for modulating interactions with other MMR components. Three approaches, ATP hydrolysis assays, limited proteolysis protection, and equilibrium dialysis, provide evidence that the amino-terminal domain of Mlh1 binds ATP with >10-fold higher affinity than does the amino-terminal domain of Pms1. This is consistent with a model wherein ATP may first bind to Mlh1, resulting in events that permit ATP binding to Pms1 and later steps in DNA mismatch repair.

S. A. 1997; 94: 5831-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 5Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). GHKL family members all share conserved amino acid motifs implicated in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Consistent with this fact, E. coli MutL binds ATP, resulting in a large conformational change in the protein (6Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). MutL also catalyzes a weak ATPase reaction (7Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) that is thought to be required for DNA mismatch repair (8Spampinato C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Based on their homology to MutL and the other GHKL family members, eukaryotic MutL homologs are also expected to bind and hydrolyze ATP. In yeast, mutation rate measurements indicate that amino acids in the conserved ATP binding motifs of Mlh1 and Pms1 are essential for mismatch repair, and partial proteolysis experiments indicate that Mlh1 undergoes an ATP-induced conformational change (9Tran P. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6390-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we provide direct evidence that yeast Mlh1 and Pms1 both bind and hydrolyze ATP independently of each other and that they both change conformation upon ATP binding. Moreover, we provide three lines of evidence that Mlh1 binds ATP with substantially higher affinity than does Pms1. The results suggest that proper coordination of the MMR pathway may involve sequential binding of ATP, first to one then the other ATP binding site in the Mlh1-Pms1 heterodimer. Regions of yeast MLH1 encoding amino acids 1–343 and PMS1 encoding amino acids 32–396 were amplified by PCR using pMH1 (10Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and pMH8 (11Shcherbakova P.V. Hall M.C. Lewis M.S. Bennett S.E. Martin K.J. Bushel P.R. Afshari C.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 940-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as templates, respectively. NcoI and NotI restriction enzyme sites introduced by the primers were used to clone the PCR products into pET30a (Novagen). The constructs allowed isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced production of the two proteins, designated Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396), as fusions with a 6-His tag for nickel affinity purification. Missense mutations in Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396) were made directly in these constructs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). MLH1 and PMS1 alleles were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm the correct sequence. TheURA3-based yeast integrative plasmid YIpMLH1 has been described previously (12Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The 2 μ-based plasmid pMMR82 containing the yeast PMS1 gene with 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream regions cloned in YEplac195 (13Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by L. Prakash (University of Texas). To create plasmid YIpPMS1, a 4.4-kbSalI fragment with the PMS1 gene from pMMR82 was cloned into the SalI site of yeast integrativeURA3 plasmid pRS306 (14Sikorski R.S. Heiter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Missense mutations in theMLH1 and PMS1 genes were created in YIpMLH1 and YIpPMS1 by site-directed PCR mutagenesis and confirmed by partial sequencing of MLH1 and PMS1 as described previously (12Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For construction of mutant yeast strains, at least three independently obtained mutant derivatives of YIpMLH1 or YIpPMS1 were used. Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid strains E134 (MATα ade5 lys2::InsEA14trp1-289 his7-2 leu2-3,112 ura3-52) and E68 (MATα ade2-1 arg4-8 leu2-3,112 thr1-4 trp1-1 ura3-52 lys2Δ cup1-1) and mlh1Δ and pms1Δ derivatives of E134 have been described previously (11Shcherbakova P.V. Hall M.C. Lewis M.S. Bennett S.E. Martin K.J. Bushel P.R. Afshari C.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 940-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To create haploid strains with missense mutations in the MLH1 gene, the chromosomal MLH1 gene in strain E134 was replaced with the mutant alleles using mutant derivatives of plasmid YIpMLH1 as described previously (12Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Haploid strains with mutations in the PMS1gene were constructed in a similar way using mutant derivatives of plasmid YIpPMS1 cut with HpaI. Diploid strains heterozygous for mlh1 or pms1 mutations and a control wild-type diploid were constructed by crossing E68 to E134 or itsmlh1 or pms1 mutants. Rates oflys2::InsEA14 and his7-2reversion and forward mutation to canavanine resistance were measured by fluctuation analysis as described previously (12Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Proteins were overproduced from pET30a in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. A single transformant was grown up to 5 liters in 2×YT medium under antibiotic selection at 30 °C. At an optical density (600 nm) of 0.75, 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Invitrogen) was added to the 5-liter cultures, and growth was continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −20 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The protocols for purification of Mlh1(343), Pms1(396), and all mutants were identical. Thawed cells were resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A (25 mmNaPO4, pH 7.6 at 23 °C, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mm imidazole, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was sonicated using a model W140 Cell Disrupter (Branson Sonic Power Co.) to achieve a water-like viscosity and cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow (Qiagen) column (1.5 cm inner diameter) equilibrated with buffer A + 10 mm imidazole at 1.0 ml/min. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A + 20 mmimidazole and developed with a linear gradient of imidazole (20–250 mm) in buffer A while collecting 1.0-ml fractions. Fractions containing the desired protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at 23 °C, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 100 mm NaCl. The dialysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer B + 100 mm NaCl. This column was washed with 25 ml of the same buffer and developed with a linear gradient of NaCl (100–750 mm) in buffer B while collecting 1.0-ml fractions. Fractions containing the desired protein (elution peak at ∼500 mm NaCl) were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 at 23 °C, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). To remove the 5-kDa affinity tag, the purified fusion proteins were treated with recombinant enterokinase (Novagen) as directed by the supplier, leaving Ala-Met-Ala attached to the amino terminus. The cleaved proteins were loaded by gravity flow onto a 1-ml single-stranded DNA cellulose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) column equilibrated with buffer C, washed with 3 ml of buffer C, and eluted with buffer C containing 500 mm NaCl. Proteins were dialyzed against either buffer C or buffer D (25 mmNaPO4, pH 7.6 at 23 °C, 50 mm NaOAc, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mm MgCl2), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All ATPase assays were performed in buffer D at 30 °C. For rate measurements, reactions (30 μl) contained 1 mm [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for Mlh1(343) and its mutant derivatives or 10 mm[α-32P]ATP for Pms1(396) and its mutant derivatives. For Km measurements, reactions (15 μl) contained varying concentrations of [α-32P]ATP. Reaction products were separated on TLC plates (Mallinckrodt Baker Inc.) developed with 0.8 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid. Results were extracted using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Reactions (20 μl) were performed in buffer C and contained ∼2.5 μg of protein and the indicated concentration of a 1:1 ATP/MgCl2 mixture. After 5 min to allow ATP binding, reactions were initiated with 125 ng of trypsin and incubated at room temperature for 45 min (Mlh1(343) and mutants) or 15 min (Pms1(396) and mutants). Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS loading dye, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and products visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Digital image analysis was used to calculate the percentage of protein protected at each ATP concentration using the formula (Pint −P0)/(Ptot −P0), where Pint is the band intensity of the intact protein at a given ATP concentration,Ptot is the band intensity of the intact protein in a mock reaction lacking trypsin, and P0 is the band intensity of intact protein in the absence of ATP. Equilibrium microdialyzers (Harvard Apparatus Inc.) containing two 25-μl chambers separated by a 10,000-dalton molecular mass cutoff dialysis membrane were used. One chamber contained protein in buffer D, and the other chamber contained [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in buffer D. A 48 h incubation at 4 °C was required to achieve equilibrium. Three 5-μl samples were drawn from each side of microdialyzers and counted with a Beckman LS 7800 liquid scintillation counter. Control experiments lacking protein were included to ensure that equilibrium was achieved. In all experiments, more than 90% of the protein remained soluble after the 48-h incubation. A 43-kilodalton NH2-terminal domain (NTD) of E. coli DNA gyrase B, a GHKL family member, was previously used to study ATP binding and hydrolysis (16Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9801-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and a similar NTD ofE. coli MutL also binds and hydrolyzes ATP (6Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Based on these precedents, we began this study using NTDs of yeast Mlh1 and Pms1 proteins that were identified by proteolysis and mass spectrometry. 2M. C. Hall, P. V. Shcherbakova, C. Borchers, J. M. Dial, K. B. Tomer, and T. A. Kunkel, manuscript in preparation. These proteins (Fig. 1A) contain the first 343 amino acids of Mlh1 and amino acids 32–396 of Pms1. The latter choice was prompted by structure-based sequence alignments (7Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and byin vivo complementation studies with plasmid-borne yeastPMS1 genes containing a mutation in either codon 1 or 32 and studies mapping the 5′ end of PMS1 mRNA (10Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 3W. Kramer, unpublished observations. These approaches indicate that functional Pms1 can be expressed using methionine codon 32 of the published PMS1 sequence as a start codon for translation. To avoid confusion relative to the published amino acid numbering for yeast Pms1, the NTD of Pms1 is designated here as Pms1(396), while the corresponding Mlh1 NTD is designated Mlh1(343). Both proteins were overproduced in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2). When the purified Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396) preparations were examined for the ability to hydrolyze ATP, ATPase activities were readily detected (compare first and last three lanes in Fig. 3, A andB). To determine whether these ATPase activities were intrinsic to Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396), we purified two different mutant derivatives predicted to lack ATPase activity. In the crystal structure of the MutL NTD, a conserved Asn (residue 35 in Mlh1 and 65 in Pms1, Fig. 1, B and C) participates in coordinating a Mg2+ ion thought to be required for ATP binding (6Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Based on crystal structures of NTDs of gyrase B and MutL (6Ban C. Junop M. Yang W.

A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Glu-31 in Mlh1 and Glu-61 in Pms1 (Fig. 1, B and C) may serve as general bases for catalyzing ATP hydrolysis. Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396) proteins with homologous N35A and N65A substitutions have levels of ATPase activity that are reduced by 84 and 95%, respectively (Fig. 3, A andB, and Table I). The E31A and E61A mutant preparations also had decreased ATPase activities (TableI). These data indicate that the majority of the ATPase activities in the wild-type protein preparations are intrinsic to Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396). The weak ATPase activities detected in the mutant protein preparations (Table I) may reflect contaminating ATPase that is too faint to be seen by SDS-PAGE. For example, the N35A mutant of Mlh1(343), which does not interact significantly with ATP (see below), still exhibited an ATPase level 18% that of wild-type Mlh1(343). This residual activity is more apparent in Mlh1(343) mutant preparations, because the kcat for ATPase activity of Mlh1(343) is weaker than that of Pms1(396) (Table I).Figure 1E. coli MutL and S. cerevisiae Mlh1 and Pms1 proteins.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether loss of ATPase activity in the mutant proteins correlates with loss of MMR in vivo, we examined mutation rates at three different loci in haploid yeast strains harboring these same mutations. The mlh1-N35A andpms1-N65A mutations both resulted in a strong mutator phenotype indistinguishable from that of the mlh1 deletion or pms1 deletion strain. The mlh1-E31A andpms1-E61A mutations were also mutators (TableII), consistent with a previous report (9Tran P. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6390-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis indicated that the level of expression of wild-type, E31A, and N35A Mlh1p in the three haploid yeast strains was similar (data not shown). Parallel attempts with the pms1strains were unsuccessful, because there was insufficient Pms1 expressed from the natural promoter on the chromosome to detect using anti-Pms1.Table IIEffect of amino changes in ATP binding domains of Mlh1p and Pms1p on spontaneous mutagenesisGenotypeLys+reversion2-aMutation rates for haploid strains with mutations in MLH1 or PMS1 and isogenic wild-type strain E134.His+reversion2-aMutation rates for haploid strains with mutations in MLH1 or PMS1 and isogenic wild-type strain E134.Canrmutation2-aMutation rates for haploid strains with mutations in MLH1 or PMS1 and isogenic wild-type strain E134.Reversion rate (×10−6)2-bRates are given as medians for at least nine independent cultures, with 95% confidence limits in parentheses.Fold increase2-cRelative to the wild-type mutation rate.Reversion rate (×10−8)2-bRates are given as medians for at least nine independent cultures, with 95% confidence limits in parentheses.Fold increase2-cRelative to the wild-type mutation rate.Mutation rate (×10−8)2-bRates are given as medians for at least nine independent cultures, with 95% confidence limits in parentheses.Fold increase2-cRelative to the wild-type mutation rate.Wild-type0.15 (0.12–0.18)10.63 (0.41–1.1)119 (16–29)1mlh1Δ1600 (1200–2600)11,00079 (67–96)130370 (340–440)19pms1Δ1400 (1200–1700)940089 (75–97)140540 (350–1300)28mlh1-N35A1400 (1100–2300)9800110 (74–140)170540 (440–780)28pms1-N65A1700 (1300–2700)11,00078 (72–96)120400 (330–620)21mlh1-E31A490 (400–580)330023 (18–27)36160 (120–180)8pms1-E61A8.7 (6.3–12)603.5 (2.6–5.2)627 (17–41)12-a Mutation rates for haploid strains with mutations in MLH1 or PMS1 and isogenic wild-type strain E134.2-b Rates are given as medians for at least nine independent cultures, with 95% confidence limits in parentheses.2-c Relative to the wild-type mutation rate. Open table in a new tab Note that the pms1-E61A mutation only conferred a weak mutator phenotype (60-fold, as compared with 11,000-fold for themlh1 deletion mutant), despite a 50-fold reduction in ATPase activity by the mutant protein (Table I). In contrast, the decrease in ATPase activity of Mlh1-E31A resulted in a severe reduction of mismatch repair in vivo. The reduced ATPase activity of Pms1-E61A may be sufficient for completion of the majority of mismatch repair events, whereas completion of repair is apparently more sensitive to perturbation of the Mlh1 ATPase activity. To determine whether the mlh1 or pms1 mutations confer a mutator phenotype in the presence of the wild-type MLH1 orPMS1 alleles, we constructed diploid yeast strains heterozygous for each of the four missense mutations. TheMLH1/mlh1Δ strain heterozygous formlh1 deletion has a Lys+ reversion rate elevated 3–5-fold (Table III). We showed previously that this mutator effect results from loss of the wild-typeMLH1 allele in a small fraction of cells rather than reduced MMR capacity in the heterozygous cells (12Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Heterozygosity for themlh1-E31A or pms1-E61A mutations did not increase the mutation rate above the increase conferred by heterozygosity formlh1 deletion (Table III). However, heterozygosity for themlh1-N35A mutation led to a 480-fold elevation of mutation rate. This suggests that the mutant Mlh1p inhibits MMR by wild-type Mlh1p, albeit not completely, since deletion of mlh1 results in an 11,000-fold mutator effect. In contrast to the results with themlh1-N35A mutation, the analogous pms1-N65Amutation did not confer a dominant mutator effect. The semidominant effect of mlh1-N35A, but not pms1-N65A, and the differential mutator effects of mlh1-E31A andpms1-E61A mutations in haploid strains, are both consistent with the idea of functional asymmetry within the Mlh1-Pms1 heterodimer. This interpretation is qualified by the fact that the N65A Pms1 expression level from the natural promoter is unknown, although we do note the N65A substitution did not adversely affect solubility or the stability of Pms1(396) overproduced in E. coli (Fig. 2).Table IIIMutator phenotypes of diploids heterozygous for mlh1 and pms1 mutationsGenotypeLys+reversion3-aReversion rates were measured for diploid strains heterozygous for mlh1 or pms1mutations and an isogenic wild-type diploid strain.Reversion rate (×10−8)3-bRates are given as medians for nine independent cultures, with 95% confidence limits in parentheses.Fold increase3-cRelative to the wild-type mutation rate.Wild-type17 (12–32)1MLH1/mlh1Δ56 (42–80)3.2MLH1/mlh1-E31A33 (29–45)1.9PMS1/pms1-E61A21 (16–28)1.2MLH1/mlh1-N35A8300 (7200–9500)480PMS1/pms1-N65A78 (72–130)4.63-a Reversion rates were measured for diploid strains heterozygous for mlh1 or pms1mutations and an isogenic wild-type diploid strain.3-b Rates are given as medians for nine independent cultures, with 95% confidence limits in parentheses.3-c Relative to the wild-type mutation rate. Open table in a new tab Next, the ATPase activities of the wild-type Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396) proteins were measured as a function of increasing ATP concentration (Fig. 3,C and D) to obtain steady state kinetic values (Table I). The Km for Mlh1(343) (69 μm) is 22-fold lower than the Km for Pms1(396) (1.5 mm), suggesting that Mlh1(343) has a greater ATP binding affinity. The turnover number (kcat) of Mlh1(343) is also lower (by 6.5-fold) than that of Pms1(396) (TableI), such that the catalytic efficiencies of the two proteins differ by only 3-fold (kcat/Km of 3 × 10−4 for Mlh1(343) and 1 × 10−4 for Pms1(396)). The large difference inKm between Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396) illustrates a biochemical asymmetry in the Mlh1-Pms1 heterodimer that may be related to the functional asymmetry observed in vivo. Because the NTD of E. coli MutL hydrolyzes ATP at a 10-fold lower rate than does full-length MutL (6Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we tested whether intact yeast Mlh1-Pms1 heterodimer possesses higher ATPase activity than Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396). When purified as described previously (10Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and analyzed under conditions similar to those used in Fig. 3A, the Mlh1-Pms1 preparation hydrolyzes ATP at a rate of 0.3–0.4 min−1. This rate is only slightly higher than the combined rates for the individual NTDs. Difficulties in purifying the N35A/N65A double mutant heterodimer preclude the interpretation that all this ATPase activity is intrinsic to Mlh1-Pms1. Nonetheless, we conclude that the ATPase activity of the heterodimer is weak and not substantially greater than that of the individual NTDs. Given the lar"

The primary barrier to such xenotransplantation is the reaction between natural antibodies present in humans and Old World monkeys and the Galα(1–3)Gal epitope (xenograft antigen, xenoantigen) found on the cell surfaces of the donor organ. This hyperacute immune response leads ultimately to graft rejection. Because of its high specificity for the xenograft antigen, isolectin 1-B4 fromGriffonia simplicifolia (GS-1-B4) has been used as an immunodiagnostic reagent. Furthermore, haptens that inhibit natural antibodies also inhibit GS-1-B4 from binding to the xenoantigen. Here we report the first x-ray crystal structure of the xenograft antigen bound to a protein (GS-1-B4). The three-dimensional structure was determined from orthorhombic crystals at a resolution of 2.3 Å. To probe the influence of binding on ligand properties, we report also the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on this complex as well as on the free ligand. The MD simulations were performed with the AMBER force-field for proteins augmented with the GLYCAM parameters for glycosides and glycoproteins. The simulations were performed for up to 10 ns in the presence of explicit solvent. Through comparison with MD simulations performed for the free ligand, it has been determined that GS-1-B4recognizes the lowest energy conformation of the disaccharide. In addition, the x-ray and modeling data provide clear explanations for the reported specificities of the GS-1-B4 lectin. It is anticipated that a further understanding of the interactions involving the xenograft antigen will help in the development of therapeutic agents for application in the prevention of hyperacute xenograft rejection.

As in many other legume lectins, GS-1 relies on the presence of divalent metal cations for its carbohydrate-binding activity (10Hayes C.E. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1904-1914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GS-1 is a mixture of five tetrameric isolectins that vary in their content of A and B subunits (11Murphy L.A. Goldstein I.J.

Winter H.G. Subcell. Biochem. 1999; 32: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Competitive binding studies have shown that the GS-1 isolectin composed of four B subunits (GS-1-B4) has a high affinity for the Galα(1–3)Gal sequence (12Goldstein I.J. Winter H.G. Subcell.

Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 3Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The V0 sector proteolipid subunits Vma3p, Vma11p, and Vma16p are thought to form the proton pore, probably in combination with the large integral membrane subunit Vph1p (5Manolson M.F. Proteau D.

The functions of the remaining subunits are poorly understood.Vma1p and Vma2p are present in three copies each per complex and are believed to reside within the bulky head domain seen in low resolution electron microscopic studies of the V-ATPase (8Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The head domain appears to be attached to the membrane via two stalk regions. The composition of the stalk regions is unknown, but it is hypothesized that they may contain most of the subunits of undefined function and that these subunits could be involved in coupling the V-ATPase both structurally and functionally.The V-ATPase is a tightly coupled enzyme that only exhibits activity when the enzyme is fully assembled with all subunits at the membrane. When cells are deprived of glucose, V1 sectors disassemble from the membrane (9Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sumner J.P.

Disassembly results in the silencing of both sectors: V1 is inactive as an Mg-ATPase, and the V0 proton pore is closed (11Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The free V1 and V0 sectors can be rapidly reassembled to form functional V-ATPase complexes upon glucose re-addition. This is thought to be a form of regulation of the V-ATPase that may assure that cytosolic ATP stores are conserved in times of starvation (15Wieczorek H. Grber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Results from a variety of investigations have led to the hypothesis that the C and H subunits of the V1 sector (Vma5p and Vma13p, respectively) are instrumental in structural and functional coupling of the V-ATPase. When VMA5 is deleted from the yeast genome, both a fully assembled V0 subcomplex and a core V1 subcomplex are formed, whereas in most other V1 subunit deletion strains, the V1 core complex is fully or partially disassembled (17Kane P.M. Tarsio M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17275-17283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose deprivation studies have shown that Vma5p is lost from both sectors during disassembly, suggesting that Vma5p may be directly involved in signaling V1 release from the membrane (9Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). WhenVMA13 is deleted, the V-ATPase does assemble, but is inactive, indicating that Vma13p is an activator or a structural stabilizer (19Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vma13p is found in cytosolic V1 complexes formed in the absence of an intact V0 sector or released from the membrane by glucose deprivation (14Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). V1 sectors from a vma13Δ strain contain all of the other V1 subunits, but unlike cytosolic V1 complexes from wild-type cells, are active as Mg-ATPases (14Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This suggests a more complex role for Vma13p as a regulator of the V-ATPase, in which it silences cytosolic V1, but activates assembled V1V0 complexes. If Vma5p and Vma13p are involved in tightly coupling and regulating the V-ATPase, the levels of subunit within a cell could be important in V-ATPase function and regulation. In this study, we have addressed the effect of overexpression of Vma5p and Vma13p on V-ATPase function.DISCUSSIONVma5p and Vma13p have been implicated in the structural and functional coupling of the V-ATPase. Based on this, we had hypothesized that overexpression of one or both of these two subunits might inactivate the V-ATPase by dissociating the fully assembled complex into free V1 and V0 sectors. Although we did observe a Vma− phenotype characteristic of inactivation of the V-ATPase, the structural basis of this phenotype is less straightforward. This study does provide new insights into the functional roles of these two subunits, however. Overproduction of Vma13p results in an assembled V1V0 complex that is capable of ATP hydrolysis, but not proton transport. This is the first reported example of a fully uncoupled V-ATPase complex. Overexpression of Vma5p appears to destabilize fully assembled V-ATPase complexes by an unknown mechanism, but more significantly, drives association of Vma5p with cytosolic V1 complexes. We hypothesize that this association may be responsible, at least in part, for the fact that overexpressed Vma5p has even more damaging effects on cells than does a total loss of V-ATPase activity. It is significant that these structural and functional phenotypes of overproduction have not been seen for deletion or point mutations in any yeast V-ATPase subunit and thus are completely novel. We have not determined whether the effects of Vma5p or Vma13p overexpression arise during biosynthesis of the V-ATPase, through some type of exchange or sequestering of subunits in the cytosol or by another mechanism; but we describe the implications of these phenotypes below.Overexpression of Vma13p Functionally Uncouples ATP Hydrolysis and Proton TranslocationVma13p is a member of the peripheral V1 sector, but one of its distinctive characteristics is that it does not appear to be essential for association of V1 subunits with V0 sectors in isolated vacuoles (19Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuoles from vma13Δ cells lack all V-ATPase activity, but do assemble other V1 subunits at the membrane; deletion of other V1 subunits appears to prevent association of the remaining peripheral subunits with the membrane (19Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic V1 sectors isolated fromvma13Δ cells also contain all of the other V1subunits, but do exhibit some MgATPase activity, suggesting they have lost some of the “silencing” of MgATPase activity that usually accompanies release of V1 from the membrane (14Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based on this behavior of vma13Δ mutants, Vma13p is believed to act as an activator of V1V0 complexes and as an inhibitor of free V1 complexes. It has been hypothesized that it achieves this dual role by stabilizing a “coupled” conformation of V1V0 that is competent for ATP-driven proton pumping and then undergoing a conformational change when V1 is released from the membrane that prevents catalysis by free V1 (14Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Interpretation of the data from Vma13p overproduction in this context would suggest that, in the presence of extra copies of Vma13p, an intermediate conformation is present in which Vma13p has moved out of its V1 inhibitory conformation to allow MgATP hydrolysis to occur, but V1 and V0 are not attached in a manner compatible with ATP-driven proton pumping. From the data presented here and the information available about Vma13p binding and function, we cannot distinguish whether the V-ATPase is functionally uncoupled because the V0 is an open proton pore or because conformational changes generated by ATP hydrolysis cannot be relayed to the proton pore, perhaps because of a structural defect in one of the stalks. Partial loss of Vma4p and Vma8p, two putative stalk subunits, would be consistent with either functional defect; further experiments may allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities. It is notable that a milder uncoupling defect was also observed for severalvma8Δ mutants (40Xu T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22075-22081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). How does overproduction of Vma13p generate the uncoupled V1V0 complexes? If Vma13p has binding sites on both the V1 and V0 sectors, as suggested by its role in activating coupled ATP hydrolysis and proton transport and by cross-linking (39Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and two-hybrid (41Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.M. Correa J. Chen W. Manolson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15449-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) experiments, excess Vma13p might allow binding of individual Vma13p molecules to V1 and V0. Isolated vacuoles do not contain excess Vma13p (Fig. 5A), but this does not eliminate the possibility that low affinity binding of a second Vma13p is responsible for generating the final complex we observed. The data showing normal levels of Vma4p and Vma8p in cytosolic V1 complexes (Fig. 7) argue against an alternative model in which excess Vma13p sequesters these subunits in the cytosol, preventing their assembly with V1. It is notable that mammalian V-ATPases contain two isoforms of subunit H (Vma13p) (42Zhou Z. Peng S.B. Crider B.P. Slaughter C. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 43Zhou Z. Peng S.B. Crider B.P. Andersen P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15913-15919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and there is evidence indicating that both isoforms may be present at nonequivalent sites in a single V-ATPase complex (39Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). There is no evidence of a second Vma13p isoform in yeast, but it is possible that overexpression allows inappropriate binding of a second Vma13p to a site similar to that occupied by the second isoform in mammalian cells and thus alters the properties of the yeast enzyme.Several other features of Vma13p must also be considered in interpreting these data, however. Vma13p is unique among the V-ATPase subunits in its ability to interact with other, non-V-ATPase complexes. Surprisingly, human VMA13 was shown to bind the human immunodeficiency virus-1 NEF protein and more recently was demonstrated to play a critical role in facilitating NEF internalization (44Lu X. Yu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In yeast, Vma13p was recently demonstrated to interact with the Golgi-localized ectoapyrase Ynd1p and to act as an inhibitor of its activity (45Zhong X. Malhotra R. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35592-35599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although Vma13p appeared to act in the context of fully assembled V-ATPase complexes (whether active or inactive) in its regulation of Ynd1p, overexpressed Vma13p generated even lower levels of Ynd1p-dependent ADPase activity than VMA13 expressed at wild-type levels, probably due both to down-regulation of Ynd1p levels and further inhibition of the enzyme by excess Vma13p. It is possible that the full spectrum of Vma13p-binding partners and cellular functions is not yet known, and phenotypes of VMA13 overexpression could reflect its activities in these other complexes as well. This could help to account for the gain of function that we observed when VMA13 was overexpressed at modest levels in vma11Δ cells or at high levels in wild-type cells. We do not believe that alternative Vma13p functions account for the uncoupled V-ATPase and proton pumping activities in isolated vacuoles, however, because the V-ATPase complexes show specific structural defects. It is also significant that modest levels of VMA13 overexpression in an otherwise wild-type background (Fig. 1) yield a characteristic Vma−phenotype, suggesting that a specific V-ATPase defect predominates under these conditions.Overexpression of Vma5p Generates a Novel Cytosolic V1ComplexAlthough both Vma13p and Vma5p have been viewed as structurally and functionally bridging V1 and V0 complexes, there are both similarities and differences in the phenotypes of vma13Δ and vma5Δstrains. Both deletions exhibit the full range of Vma−growth defects, and both allow more assembly of both V1 and V0 sectors than any other V1 subunit deletion strain (18Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated vacuoles from vma5Δ strains contain very low levels of V1 sector subunits, however (22Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vma5p is also lost from both sectors when V1 and V0 sectors dissociate during glucose depletion and is reassembled with both sectors upon glucose re-addition (9Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a critical role for Vma5p in attachment of V1 and V0 and possible involvement in signaling their reversible disassembly in vivo. It has also been proposed that release of Vma5p from V1 could play a role, in cooperation with Vma13p inhibition, in the silencing of MgATP hydrolysis in cytosolic V1 sectors (14Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).The data shown here demonstrate that excess Vma5p can affect both fully assembled V-ATPase complexes and free V1 complexes. V-ATPase complexes in isolated vacuoles are destabilized by the presence of excess Vma5p, but the specific structural defect is subtle because the complexes have an apparently normal subunit composition. This type of subtle defect in V-ATPase structure is also characteristic of a number of VMA5 point mutations 2K. K. Curtis, S. A. Francis, Y. E. Oluwatosin, and P. M. Kane, submitted for publication. and may indicate that Vma5p is responsible not only for the crude attachment of V1 sectors to V0, but also for more subtle features underlying “correct” attachment of the two complexes. Significantly, there is no evidence of uncoupling of V1 and V0 activities in isolated vacuoles; ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping are decreased by roughly the same amount in vacuoles from VMA5-overexpressing strains (Table I and Fig. 4). The effects of VMA5 overexpression on cytosolic V1sectors are somewhat clearer. Vma5p has never been isolated with cytosolic V1 sectors from glucose-deprived cells or yeast cells containing only cytosolic V1 sectors because of deletion of a V0 subunit (14Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, it does coprecipitate with V1 from vma11Δ cells overexpressing VMA5. In this case, excess VMA5may allow binding to a low affinity site on V1 that cannot be bound in the presence of normal Vma5p levels. Although we did not observe Mg-ATPase activity in our assays of the ion-exchange fractions, these fractions contained lower levels of subunit protein than we assayed in the past (14Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It remains an intriguing possibility that Vma5p bound to cytosolic V1 complexes activates some level of futile ATP hydrolysis and that this accounts for the deleterious gain of function observed when Vma5p is overproduced at high levels or in the presence of high levels of cytosolic V1 (in avma11Δ strain). Further experiments will be necessary to test this possibility. Vma5p has not yet been shown to participate in other complexes as Vma13p does, so it is more difficult to attribute overexpression phenotypes to non-V-ATPase-associated activities.Physiological Relevance of V1 Subunit Overexpression StudiesAlthough we have focused on the biochemical significance of the complexes formed in the presence of VMA5 andVMA13 overexpression, these results do have physiological relevance, particularly for VMA5. The human VMA5gene was the only V-ATPase subunit gene identified among those genes whose mRNA levels change in response to cytomegalovirus infection;VMA5 mRNA levels were 8-fold higher 24 h after viral infection (46Zhu H. Cong J.P. Mamtora G. Gingeras T. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14470-14475Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). VMA5 mRNA levels were 8.9-fold higher after yeast cells were treated for 10 min with 0.4 mNaCl; but in this case, several other V-ATPase subunit genes were coordinately up-regulated (35Posas F. Chambers J.R. Heyman J.A. Hoeffler J.P. de Nadal E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17249-17255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Protein levels were not determined in either of these studies, so it remains to be determined whether and to what level Vma5p is overproduced; but the studies reported here suggest that the functional consequences of even 2–3-fold overproduction of Vma5p could be very significant. The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)1 is an electrogenic proton pump found throughout the endomembrane system (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar,2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase harnesses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to pump protons across membranes, creating an electrochemical gradient. V-ATPases share both sequence and structural similarities with F-type ATP synthases, and preliminary experiments indicate a fundamental similarity in their mechanisms (3Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Few specific details about how V-ATPases couple ATP hydrolysis and proton transport are available, however, because the sequence similarities with F-ATPases lie primarily in the ATP-binding and proton pore subunits, not in the “stalk” subunits believed to be predominantly responsible for structural and functional coupling (4Margolles-Clark E. Tenney K. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae V-ATPase has been extensively studied and has proven to be an excellent model for all eukaryotic V-ATPases. To date, 13 subunits have been identified and assigned to either the peripheral cytoplasmic V1 sector or the membrane-associated V0 sector; however, a limited number of subunits have assigned function. The V1 sector subunit Vma1p contains the catalytic nucleotide-binding sites, whereas Vma2p possesses regulatory nucleotide-binding sites (2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 3Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).

Vma1p and Vma2p are present in three copies each per complex and are believed to reside within the bulky head domain seen in low resolution electron microscopic studies of the V-ATPase (8Wilkens S.

Results from a variety of investigations have led to the hypothesis that the C and H subunits of the V1 sector (Vma5p and Vma13p, respectively) are instrumental in structural and functional coupling of the V-ATPase.

Subgroup 1 includes the yeast and human endoplasmic reticulum (ER) α1,2-mannosidases that primarily trim Man9GlcNAc2 to Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B whereas subgroup 2 includes mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases IA, IB, and IC that trim Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 via Man8GlcNAc2 isomers A and C. The structure of the catalytic domain of the subgroup 2 α1,2-mannosidase fromPenicillium citrinum has been determined by molecular replacement at 2.2-Å resolution. The fungal α1,2-mannosidase is an (αα)7-helix barrel, very similar to the subgroup 1 yeast (Vallée, F., Lipari, F., Yip, P., Sleno, B., Herscovics, A., and Howell, P. L. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 581–588) and human (Vallée, F., Karaveg, K., Herscovics, A., Moremen, K. W., and Howell, P. L. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 41287–41298) ER enzymes. The location of the conserved acidic residues of the catalytic site and the binding of the inhibitors, kifunensine and 1-deoxymannojirimycin, to the essential calcium ion are conserved in the fungal enzyme. However, there are major structural differences in the oligosaccharide binding site between the two α1,2-mannosidase subgroups. In the subgroup 1 enzymes, an arginine residue plays a critical role in stabilizing the oligosaccharide substrate. In the fungal α1,2-mannosidase this arginine is replaced by glycine. This replacement and other sequence variations result in a more spacious carbohydrate binding site. Modeling studies of interactions between the yeast, human and fungal enzymes with different Man8GlcNAc2 isomers indicate that there is a greater degree of freedom to bind the oligosaccharide in the active site of the fungal enzyme than in the yeast and human ER α1,2-mannosidases.

Class I α1,2-mannosidases (family 47 of the glycosylhydrolases) participate in different aspects of eukaryotic glycoprotein biosynthesis (for reviews see Refs. 1Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys.

Although members of this protein family exhibit significant amino acid similarities and characteristic signature motifs (available at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼cazy/CAZY/GH_47.html), they can be classified into three functionally distinct subgroups according to their enzymatic activities.

The mammalian enzymes in this subfamily form the Man5GlcNAc2 intermediate necessary for the formation of complex and hybrid N-glycansin vivo. This subgroup of enzymes produces Man8GlcNAc2 isomers A and C from Man9GlcNAc2. The specificity of this subgroup is therefore distinct from that of the ER α1,2-mannosidases (subgroup 1) because the Man8GlcNAc2 isomers formed from Man9GlcNAc2 are different from the isomer formed by the ER α1,2-mannosidases. endoplasmic reticulum 1-deoxymannojirimycin kifunensine fungal orP. citrinum Class I α1,2-mannosidase fungal Class I α1,2-mannosidase with bound dMNJ fungal Class I α1,2-mannosidase with bound kifunensine yeast ER Class I α1,2-mannosidase human ER Class I α1,2-mannosidase short-connection long-connection root mean square deviation endoplasmic reticulum 1-deoxymannojirimycin kifunensine fungal orP. citrinum Class I α1,2-mannosidase fungal Class I α1,2-mannosidase with bound dMNJ fungal Class I α1,2-mannosidase with bound kifunensine yeast ER Class I α1,2-mannosidase human ER Class I α1,2-mannosidase short-connection long-connection root mean square deviation The third subgroup has significant sequence similarity to other members, but does not hydrolyze Man9GlcNAc2(15Hosokawa N.

Members of this subgroup lack the cysteine residues that form the disulfide bond shown to be essential for yeast α1,2-mannosidase activity (16Lipari F. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27615-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This subfamily participates in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation by mechanisms that are not yet understood (15Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the mouse and yeast members of this subgroup have been shown to increase the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins by proteasomes. Given their similarity to α1,2-mannosidases, these proteins are proposed to be lectins that recognize high mannose oligosaccharides on misfolded glycoproteins, but additional work is required to elucidate their function. The ER α1,2-mannosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a prototype to define structure-function relationships of Class I α1,2-mannosidases (for reviews see Refs. 1Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2Herscovics A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The yeast α1,2-mannosidase structure was determined by x-ray crystallography and shown to be an (αα)7-helix barrel with one side of the barrel plugged by a β-hairpin (19Vallée F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The nine highly conserved acidic residues and the calcium ion, all of which are essential for catalytic activity (20Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), are located at the bottom of a 15-Å deep cavity within the barrel. The yeast α1,2-mannosidase is a glycoprotein. In the crystal structure a high mannose oligosaccharide from one molecule extends into the barrel of an adjacent symmetry-related molecule interacting with the active site in what is believed to be an enzyme·product complex. This structure has provided information about protein·carbohydrate interactions within the barrel and some insight into the specificity of the ER enzymes. An arginine residue (Arg273 in yeast) was found to interact with three mannose and one N-acetylglucosamine residues at the branch points of the oligosaccharide. Mutagenesis of this arginine residue to leucine present in mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases produced a mutant enzyme that trims Man9GlcNAc2to Man5GlcNAc2. The order of mannose removal by the R273L mutant is different from that of the known naturally occurring subgroup 2 enzymes (21Romero P.A. Vallée F. Howell P.L. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11071-11074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structures of the human ER α1,2-mannosidase ortholog (22Vallée F. Karaveg K. Herscovics A.

Howell, unpublished results, PDB code1G6I.reveal no major conformation changes upon inhibitor binding. The inhibitors, with their 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl oxygen atoms coordinated by the essential calcium ion, are located at the proposed position of the mannose residue-cleaved during catalysis. The calcium ion and additional protein·carbohydrate interactions stabilize the mannose analogs in the non-standard 1C4 conformation. The catalytic mechanism of the α1,2-mannosidases appears to deviate from the classic inverting enzyme mechanism. Two alternative mechanisms have been proposed, both of which suggest that a water molecule plays the role of the catalytic acid (22Vallée F. Karaveg K. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41287-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although the structural studies of yeast and human ER α1,2-mannosidases have provided considerable insight into oligosaccharide binding and catalysis, when this work was performed no information was available regarding the structural determinants that account for the different specificities of the two enzymatically active subfamilies. The ER (subgroup 1) and Golgi (subgroup 2) α1,2-mannosidases have complementary actions, because the mannose preferentially removed from Man9GlcNAc2 by the ER enzyme is the last mannose cleaved by the Golgi enzymes (5Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We present here the structure of a subgroup 2 α1,2-mannosidase fromPenicillium citrinum and its complexes with the inhibitors 1-deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine. The specificity of this enzyme is similar to that of mammalian Golgi and Trichoderma reeseiα1,2-mannosidases, because it produces Man8GlcNAc2 isomers A and C from Man9GlcNAc2 and the last mannose removed is the mannose preferentially cleaved by the ER α1,2-mannosidases. The structure of the fungal enzyme is an (αα)7-helix barrel like the yeast, human, and recently determined T. reesei(23Van Petegem F. Contreras H. Contreras R. Van Beeumen J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) α1,2-mannosidases. There are major structural differences in the carbohydrate binding site of the subgroup 1 and 2 enzymes that create a more spacious cavity in the subgroup 2 α1,2-mannosidases. Comparative modeling of the yeast, human, and fungal enzyme interactions with different Man8GlcNAc2 isomers indicate that the barrel of the fungal enzyme allows a greater degree of freedom to bind the different forms of the oligosaccharide isomers. In contrast, only one conformer of a single isomer, Man8GlcNAc2isomer B, can be accommodated in the yeast and human ER enzymes. Constructs for the expression and methods for the purification of the soluble recombinant fungal α1,2-mannosidase from P. citrinum were as described in a previous study (24Yoshida T. Nakajima T. Ichishima E. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA of the P. citrinumα1,2-mannosidase gene (msdC) (25Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) lacking its signal sequence (nucleotides 1–105) was cloned downstream of theAspergillus amylase promoter (PamyB) and of the aspergillopepsin signal sequence. The resulting fungal expression vector pTAPM1 was transfected into Aspergillus oryzae strain MS2 (argB−). An auxotrophic transformant was cultured in medium containing dextrin as an inducer. The medium was collected after 3 days of culture at 30 °C, and the recombinant α1,2-mannosidase starting at amino acid 21 was purified from the medium by chromatography on CM-Toyopearl 650M after ammonium sulfate precipitation. Crystals of both native protein and protein·inhibitor complexes were grown at room temperature by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Equal volumes of the protein (20 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0) and of the precipitating solutions (17–22% polyethylene glycol 6000, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 4.6) were suspended over a 0.5-ml reservoir containing the same precipitating solution. Complexes of the fungal α1,2-mannosidase with either 1-deoxymannojirimycin or kifunensine were prepared by co-crystallization. The concentration of each inhibitor (0.5–10 mm) was varied to produce the best crystals. Prism-shaped crystals grew within 2 weeks to a maximum size of 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.3 mm. X-ray diffraction data were collected from the native protein crystals (FM, space group P21, unit cell dimensions a = 56.5 Å, b = 111.0 Å, c = 86.2 Å, and β = 99.2°) as well as from the isomorphous crystals grown in the presence of 4 mm kifunensine (FM·KIF) and 10 mm1-deoxymannojirimicin (FM·dMNJ). Crystals diffracted at room temperature to ∼2-Å resolution (Table I) using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator with a MAR Research (345 mm) image plate detector. All data were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of the native fungal mannosidase was solved by molecular replacement using the CNS software (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16949) Google Scholar). Coordinates of the yeast and human ER α1,2-mannosidases (PDB accession codes 1DL2 and 1FM1, respectively) and a sequence alignment of these proteins with FM were used to create a merged composite computational model of the fungal protein. Loops with poor sequence homology were omitted. In addition, the side chains were modified using the rotamer library in TURBO-FRODO (28Roussel A. Cambillau C. The TURBO-FRODO Graphics Package. Silicon Graphics Corp., Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) to correspond to the sequence of the fungal protein. This model was used as the search model for molecular replacement. Rotation functions were calculated in the resolution range of 15–4 Å. The final molecular replacement solution for the two molecules in the asymmetric unit had a correlation coefficient of 47.5% and a packing value of 53.7%. The structure was refined using the maximum likelihood target (29Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Ten percent of the structure factors were randomly selected, excluded from the refinement, and used to compute R free (30Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar). Refinement of the model using the simulated annealing slow-cooling protocol (31Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 32Brunger A.T. Kurian J.K. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) was alternated with manual inspection and rebuilding of the model using TURBO-FRODO. The two monomers in the asymmetric unit were built independently of each other. The final model for each monomer contains 475 amino acid residues, one calcium ion, and nine carbohydrate residues in three N-linked oligosaccharide chains. A total of 201 water molecules obeying proper hydrogen bond geometry were included in the model. The structure comprises amino acid residues 36–510. This model was subsequently used to refine the structures of the kifunensine (FM·KIF) and 1-deoxymannojirimycin (FM·dMNJ) inhibitor complexes (Table I). The initial ςa-weighted difference (F o − F c) electron density maps calculated using the native fungal α1,2-mannosidase structure unambiguously showed the location of the inhibitors and calcium ion. Models for 1-deoxymannojirimicin and kifunensine were generated and energy-minimized as described previously (22Vallée F. Karaveg K. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41287-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The FM·KIF and FM·dMNJ structures were refined using the same protocol described above for the native protein. The final refinement statistics for all three structures are presented in Table I. Analysis of the structures by PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed no non-glycine residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Hydrogen atoms were added to the coordinates of the yeast, human, and fungal α1,2-mannosidases using the SYBYL molecular modeling software package (SYBYL Tripos Associates, S. H. R., St Louis, MO), and partial atomic charges were derived using the Pullman procedure. The positions of the hydrogen atoms were optimized using the Tripos force field (35Clark M. Cramer R.D.I. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). The Connolly surfaces of the proteins were calculated using the MOLCAD program (36Waldherr-Teschner M. Goetze T. Heiden W. Knoblauch M. Vollhardt H. Brickmann J. Hin A.J.S. Advances in Scientific Visualization. Springer, Heidelberg1992: 58-67Crossref Google Scholar) in the SYBYL software package. The Man9GlcNAc2oligosaccharide was built in the SYBYL software using the coordinates of the monosaccharides taken from a data base of three-dimensional structures of monosaccharides (available at www.cermav.cnrs.fr/databank/monosaccharides/index.html). Atom types and partial charges were defined according to the PIM energy parameters for carbohydrates (37Perez S. Meyer C. Imberty A. Pullman B. Modelling of Biomolecular Structures and Mechanisms.

Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). Nine different complexes were created. For each of the α1,2-mannosidase structures (i.e. yeast, human, and fungal), three different orientations of the Man9GlcNAc2 substrate were considered. These correspond to the insertion of each branch of the oligosaccharide into the active site of the protein. In each case, the terminal α1,2-linked mannose of the branch was removed, i.e.mannose residues M11, M10, and M9 corresponding to isomers 8A, 8B, and 8C, respectively (Fig. 1). The penultimate mannose, M8, M7, or M6, was then oriented in the binding site in the same position as the M7 mannose observed in the binding site of the yeast α1,2-mannosidase structure (19Vallée F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This corresponds to the +1 site of the catalytic domain. The ensemble consisting of the protein together with this terminal mannose in the +1 site was then considered as rigid and a conformational search of the glycosidic linkages of the oligosaccharide was performed. Three regions were defined as follows: the βMan1–4βGlcNAc1–4βGlcNAc core (yellow in Fig. 1) was fixed in an extended conformation, the core oligomannose (mannose residues M3, M4, M5, M6, and M7) was considered as flexible and allowed to undergo a full conformational search, and the α1,2-linked mannose residues were considered as semi-rigid. In all cases the conformational searches explored the low energy region of each glycosidic linkage as determined in previous conformational studies (37Perez S. Meyer C. Imberty A. Pullman B. Modelling of Biomolecular Structures and Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht1995: 425-454Google Scholar, 39Imberty A. Delage M.M. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. Perez S. Glycoconj.

The ranges and steps are defined as follows (Fig. 1): For the rigid βMan1–4βGlcNac1–4βGlcNAc core: ΦGN14GN and ΦM14GN = Θ(O5′–C1′–O1′–C4) fixed at 280°; ΨGN14GN and ΨM14GN = Θ(C1′–O1′–C4–C5) fixed at 240°. For the flexible oligosaccharides M3, M4, M5, M6, and M7: ΦM13M = Θ(O5′–C1′–O1′–C3) from 50° to 90° in steps of 10°; ΨM13M = Θ(C1′–O1′–C3–C4) from 90° to 180° in steps of 10°; ΦM16M = Θ(O5′–C1′–O1′–C6) from 50° to 90° in steps of 10°; ΨM16M = Θ(C1′–O1′–C6–C5) from 80° to 280° in steps of 10°; ωM16M = Θ(O1′–C6–C5–O5) two possible values 60° and 300°. For the terminal part of the branches (semi-flexible): ΦM12M = Θ(O5′–C1′–O1′–C2) fixed at 75°; ΨM12M = Θ(C1′–O1′–C2–C3) from 90° to 180° in steps of 30°. The cut-off for allowing inter-penetration of van der Waals spheres was varied between 70% to 87% depending upon how sterically crowded the model was. The hydrogen associated with each hydroxyl was not taken into account during this conformational search and electrostatic interactions were not considered in the energy calculation. The resulting allowed conformations were listed, and a clustering program was used to define a series of conformational families. The lowest energy conformation of each family was further optimized in the binding site of the protein. All hydrogen atoms were considered, and the electrostatic contribution was included in energy calculations. The whole oligosaccharides as well as the side chains of the amino acids within a sphere of 12-Å radius around the site were fully optimized. The rest of the protein and the calcium ion were included in the calculations as a rigid body. The molecule consists of an (αα)7-barrel composed of 14 helices (α1–α14), which alternate from outside to inside the barrel (Fig. 2). This a"
https://openalex.org/W2068742914,"OccR is a LysR-type transcriptional regulator ofAgrobacterium tumefaciens that positively regulates the octopine catabolism operon of the Ti plasmid and is also an autorepressor. Positive control of the occ genes occurs in response to octopine, a nutrient released from crown gall tumors. OccR binds to a site upstream of the occQ promoter in the presence and absence of octopine. Octopine causes prebound OccR to undergo a conformational change at the DNA binding site that causes changes in footprint length and DNA bending. To determine the roles of these conformational changes in transcriptional activation, we isolated 22 OccR mutants that were able to activate the occQpromoter in the absence of octopine. Thirteen of these mutants contained single amino acid substitutions, and nine contained two base pair changes resulting in two amino acid substitutions, which in most cases acted synergistically. These mutations spanned the entire length of the protein. Most of these mutant proteins in the absence of octopine displayed DNA binding and bending properties characteristic of transcriptionally active OccR-octopine complexes."

We have now precisely mapped the interaction between Hid and Op-IAP, and we show clearly for the first time that the biochemical interactions between the amino terminus of Hid and BIR2 of Op-IAP are highly similar to those found between the processed amino terminus of Smac and BIR3 of XIAP. Also similar to Smac, the amino terminus of Hid must be processed to bind Op-IAP. In addition, our data also suggest that a second interaction between Hid and Op-IAP exists that does not involve the amino terminus of Hid, which may explain some of the earlier contradictory results. The evolutionary conservation of this mechanism of binding underscores its importance in apoptotic regulation. Nevertheless, interaction with Hid is not sufficient for Op-IAP to inhibit apoptosis induced by Hid overexpression or by treatment with actinomycin D, indicating that additional sequence elements are required for the anti-apoptotic function of Op-IAP.

Virol. 1994; 68: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and iap homologs have since been found in cellular genomes ranging from yeast to humans. Mostiap genes from higher eukaryotes are involved in inhibiting apoptosis, whereas those from yeast and nematodes have roles in regulating cytokinesis (3Silke J. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1821-1827PubMed Google Scholar). The hallmark motif of the IAP protein family is an ∼70-amino acid domain termed the baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR), so named because 1–3 copies are found in the amino-terminal region of all IAP proteins. Although these domains are termed “repeats,” they are not merely exact copies of each other, and different BIR domains have been shown to have different activities. In addition to the residues within the core BIR domain, the non-conserved sequences that flank BIRs have also been shown to be important for anti-apoptotic function. For example, the flanking sequences upstream of the second BIR domain of human XIAP directly bind and inhibit caspase-3, whereas the third BIR domain itself binds and inhibits caspase-9 (4Takahashi R.

Various BIR domains and/or their flanking sequences have been shown to mediate different protein-protein interactions, including self-oligomerization (7Hozak R.R. Manji G.A. Friesen P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1877-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), binding, and inhibition of certain caspases (8Deveraux Q. Takahashi R. Salvesen G. Reed J. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), and binding to a number of other proteins including theDrosophila pro-apoptotic proteins Hid, Reaper, and Grim (9Vucic D.

Most cellular IAP proteins, such as DIAP1 from Drosophilaand the human proteins XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2, appear to be able to block apoptosis by binding and inhibiting certain caspases directly, although compelling evidence for additional mechanisms also exists, including E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and interaction in signal transduction pathways (reviewed in Refs. 13Miller L.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar and 14Yang Y.L. Li X.M. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Expression of the baculovirus Op-IAP protein has been shown to inhibit the processing of a caspase called Sf-caspase-1 in the lepidopteran cell line Sf21, a cell line derived from the fall armyworm,Spodoptera frugiperda (15Seshagiri S. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13606-13611Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The processing of Sf-caspase-1 is presumably carried out by an as yet unidentified apical caspase in Sf21 cells that has been termed Sf-caspase-X (16LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, even though Op-IAP inhibits the processing of Sf-caspase-1, it has yet to be shown that a direct caspase interaction is responsible for the inhibitory action of Op-IAP. Genetic evidence fromDrosophila supports a model wherein Hid, Reaper, and Grim induce apoptosis by binding to the IAP protein DIAP1 and displacing bound caspases, thereby initiating caspase activation (17Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.-A.J. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar,18Goyal L. McCall K. Agapite J. Hartwieg E. Steller H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mammalian Smac protein appears to induce apoptosis by displacing caspase-9 from XIAP (19Chai J. Du C. Wu J.-W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the complex formed by Smac and the BIR3 domain of the human XIAP protein was determined (20Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 21Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.-W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of Smac is processed upon translocation into mitochondria, revealing a sequence element with homology to the amino terminus of Hid, Reaper, and Grim. The first four amino acids of the processed Smac amino terminus bind in a groove within the core BIR3 domain of XIAP, whereas a separate region of Smac is also involved in an additional site of interaction with BIR3. The similarity of the first four amino acids of the processed amino terminus of Smac (Ala-Val-Pro-Ile) to amino acids 2–5 of Hid (Ala-Val-Pro-Phe) led to the suggestion that Hid may be post-translationally processed by a methionine aminopeptidase, and the amino terminus of Hid may bind to IAPs by a similar mechanism to that of Smac. In support of this hypothesis, a peptide lacking the initiating methionine of Hid bound to BIR3 of XIAP, but a peptide containing the initiating methionine did not bind (20Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The recent description of the structure of BIR2 of DIAP1 bound to amino-terminal Hid, Reaper, and Grim peptides further indicates a conserved mechanism of binding in insect and mammalian proteins (22Wu J.-W. Cocina A.E. Chai J. Hay B.A. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, a different study indicated that Hid bound to DIAP1 in vitro despite the fact that additional protein sequences, consisting of a glutathione S-transferase tag used for purification, were fused to the amino terminus of Hid, presumably preventing normal amino-terminal processing (18Goyal L. McCall K. Agapite J. Hartwieg E. Steller H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Op-IAP has been shown to bind Hid, Reaper, and Grim and inhibit apoptosis stimulated by overexpression of these proteins (9Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Previous work by Vucic et al. (23Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33915-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that the region of Op-IAP containing BIR2 and its flanking sequences was necessary and sufficient to co-immunoprecipitate Hid and block Hid-induced apoptosis in Sf21 cells, although the ability to inhibit apoptosis was less efficient than full-length Op-IAP. Furthermore, a sequence required for Hid binding was mapped by deletion analysis to a region encompassing residues 174–190 of Op-IAP, including a portion of the carboxyl-terminal end of BIR2 and some of its downstream flanking sequence. Interestingly, however, this deleted region in BIR2 of Op-IAP does not include the residues that correspond to those in BIR3 of XIAP responsible for interacting with the amino terminus of Smac, as determined by crystallography. In addition, a second deletion mutant lacking residues 157–173 of Op-IAP, which does lack the residues corresponding to those shown in XIAP to bind to Smac, still co-immunoprecipitated with Hid (23Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33915-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results, along with those indicating that Hid can bind DIAP1 in vitro without processing at its amino terminus (18Goyal L. McCall K. Agapite J. Hartwieg E. Steller H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), seemed to contradict the hypothesis that Hid binds IAP proteins in a manner similar to that of Smac. Therefore, we decided to investigate the interaction between Hid and Op-IAP more closely. S. frugiperda IPLB-Sf21 (Sf21) cells were maintained in TC-100 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with tryptose broth and 10% fetal bovine serum (obtained from either BioWhittaker or Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 27 °C and propagated as described previously (24O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). All plasmids used in this study were constructed using a backbone plasmid containing aDrosophila hsp70 promoter that was previously described (25Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing carboxyl-terminally FLAG-tagged Hid,lacZ, HA-epitope tagged Op-IAP, Op-IAPR21A, Op-IAPG42A, Op-IAPC54A, Op-IAPW64A, Op-IAPR114A, Op-IAPC148A, Op-IAPH168A, Op-IAPG42AW64A, Op-IAPR21AR114A, Op-IAP-(Δ106–109), Op-IAP-(Δ157–173), Op-IAP-(Δ174–190), Op-IAPBIR1, and Op-IAPBIR2, have been described previously (10Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The Op-IAP hybrids were constructed by two-step PCR using primers containing ApaI andEcoRI sites to allow cloning into the heat shock vector. All PCR products were gel-purified with the Geneclean III kit (Bio 101), digested with ApaI and EcoRI, and cloned into the pHSEpiOpIAPVI+ vector after the coding sequence of Op-IAP was removed by digesting with ApaI and EcoRI. This allowed for all inserts to be cloned in frame with the HA tag. Point mutations were constructed using the Quikchange kit (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequences of all constructs, including those previously described, were verified before use. For bacterial expression of OpIAP BIR2, coding sequence encompassing residues 95–199 of Op-IAP, including an amino-terminal HA tag, was cloned into pET-15b (Novagen). This produced a protein containing a His6 and HA tag amino-terminal to BIR2 with its flanking sequences. BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with pET-15bBIR2 were used to inoculate 1.5 liters of Luria Broth (LB) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This culture was grown to anA600 of 0.5 at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm for 3 h at 25 °C. The culture was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellet stored overnight at −80 °C to facilitate cell breakage. Once thawed the cells were resuspended in 40 ml of chilled Extraction/Wash Buffer and purified by affinity chromatography using Talon (CLONTECH) metal affinity resin following the batch/gravity-flow protocol provided in the Talon Metal Affinity Resins User Manual (CLONTECH). In the actinomycin D protection assay, 6-well plates were seeded at a density of 5 × 105Sf21 cells/well and transfected with 1 μg of the indicated plasmid by lipid-mediated transfection. AlacZ-expressing plasmid was used as a negative control. 20 h after transfection cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 30 min to induce expression. After heat shock, cells were placed back at 27 °C. Four hours after the beginning of heat shock, the media were removed and replaced with fresh media containing actinomycin D to a final concentration of 500 ng/ml. The cells were incubated with actinomycin D for 10 h at 27 °C and then stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 dye (Molecular Probes), and all non-apoptotic nuclei were manually scored by fluorescence microscopy. The number of non-apoptotic nuclei were determined and compared with the number of non-apoptotic nuclei oflacZ-transfected controls that were not treated with actinomycin D (set at 100%), and a percent was generated that represented cell viability. This number was then subtracted from 100% and presented as percent apoptosis to be consistent with the remaining figures. Transfection efficiency was monitored in every experiment by transfection of an eGFP-expressing plasmid, and the average transfection efficiency for all experiments was 67%. In the Hid protection assay, 2 μg of the pHidflaghis plasmid was cotransfected with either 2 μg of wild type Op-IAP plasmid or the full-length Op-IAP point mutant plasmids. Alternatively, 2 μg of the pHidflaghis plasmid was co-transfected with 8 μg of the hybrid mutant Op-IAP plasmids to give a 4:1 concentration ratio of mutant Op-IAP to Hid plasmid. Where necessary, an eGFP-expressing plasmid was used to balance the amount of DNA in each transfection. Twenty hours after transfection cells were heat shocked as described above and then incubated at 27 °C for 1.25 h. At 1.25 h following the beginning of heat shock, cells exhibiting blebbing were scored as apoptotic. For both types of protection assays, 3 randomly chosen high power fields were counted per well, using 2 wells per condition per assay, and each assay was independently repeated at least 3 times. To determine whether bacterially expressed BIR2 could bind to Hid, 10 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of a peptide representing amino acids 2–11 of Hid with a carboxyl-terminal lysine residue and biotin label (AVPFYLPEGGK-biotin) was added to 200 μl of a 10% slurry of streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and gently rocked for 1 h with the beads at 4 °C to allow the peptide to bind to the beads. A similar peptide that included the initiating methionine (MAVPFYLPEGGK-biotin) was used as a control. Peptides were synthesized and purified to ≥95% purity by Sigma. The beads were washed once with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to remove any unbound peptide, followed by the addition of 5 μg of biotin. 120 ng of purified bacterially expressed BIR2 protein was added to each of the three tubes and incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The following day the beads were washed six times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Protein loading buffer and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol were added, and the mixture was heated to 95 °C to elute the complex from the beads. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA.11 mouse monoclonal antibody (Babco) and goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Bound antibody was detected using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). To analyze binding of proteins expressed in Sf21 cells, 6-well tissue culture plates were seeded with 5 × 105cells/well, and 2 wells each were transfected with 5 μg of each of the respective plasmids and heat-shocked as above. Hid peptide (1 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution) was added to streptavidin-conjugated beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads and peptide were then washed once with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (600 μl) was added to the beads and incubated with rocking at 4 °C until use. Three hours following the beginning of heat shock, the cells were harvested in 100 μl/well of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The cells of two wells of similar conditions were combined and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C. After lysis the cells were sonicated for 10 s and then spun for 5 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. Forty μl of the clarified sample was removed from each sample and transferred to a clean tube, followed by addition of protein loading buffer and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were stored at −20 °C until analysis by immunoblotting. The remaining 160 μl of clarified supernatant from each tube was added to the beads with the bound Hid peptide and allowed to rock gently at 4 °C overnight. The following day the beads were washed three times with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Where indicated, 10 mm EDTA was added to the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and the samples were then processed as described above, or 50 μg/ml MG-132 (Calbiochem) was added to the cells 0.5 h prior to heat shock. It was shown previously that Op-IAP co-immunoprecipitates with overexpressed Hid in Sf21 cells and that this interaction involves the BIR2 domain of Op-IAP and the amino terminus of Hid (10Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,23Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33915-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, direct binding of Op-IAP to Hid has not been demonstrated previously, because co-immunoprecipitation experiments from cell lysates do not exclude the possibility that other proteins are involved in the interaction. Thus, we developed a Hid binding assay that does not rely on proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells. Although full-length Op-IAP proved to be highly insoluble when overexpressed in bacteria, we were able to bacterially express and purify the BIR2 domain of Op-IAP, along with sequences flanking the BIR domain (amino acids 95–199), containing a His6 sequence and an HA epitope tag at the amino terminus. The purified recombinant BIR2 protein was used in binding assays with two carboxyl-terminally biotinylated peptides consisting of either amino acids 1–11 or 2–11 of the Drosophila Hid protein (Fig.1A). In this assay, recombinant BIR2 protein bound specifically to the peptide lacking the initiating methionine (amino acids 2–11; hereafter called the Hid peptide), but there was no detectable binding to the peptide containing the initiating methionine (amino acids 1–11; hereafter called the Met-Hid peptide). The results of this assay demonstrate a direct and specific interaction between BIR2 of OpIAP and the processed amino terminus of the Hid protein. Similar to the bacterially expressed BIR2 protein, full-length Op-IAP protein expressed in Sf21 cells also bound to the Hid peptide (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, however, Op-IAP expressed in Sf21 cells also appeared to bind the Met-Hid peptide, in contrast to the results obtained with bacterially expressed and purified BIR2 protein. To explain these contradictory results, we hypothesized that the methionine residue on the Met-Hid peptide was being removed by methionine aminopeptidase activity in the Sf21 cell lysate during incubation with the Met-Hid peptide. To test this hypothesis we added EDTA to the lysate, which would be expected to inhibit this class of proteases. As predicted, the addition of EDTA to the lysate greatly reduced binding of Op-IAP to the Met-Hid peptide but did not affect binding to the Hid peptide, consistent with the presence of methionine aminopeptidase activity in the lysate (Fig.1B). Thus Op-IAP expressed in Sf21 cells bound specifically to the processed amino terminus of Hid, as did the BIR2 domain with its flanking sequences expressed in Sf21 cells (Fig.1C). As expected based on previous results, the BIR1 and RING domains of Op-IAP, along with the negative control chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein, did not bind to the Hid peptide (Fig.1C). The Drosophila DIAP1 protein, which has also been reported to co-immunoprecipitate with Hid (10Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell.

To assess the role of the invariant conserved residues of the BIR region in Hid binding and anti-apoptotic function, we determined the effect of mutating a number of these residues to alanine (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, two deletion mutants were constructed by deleting either BIR1 or BIR2 in the context of the entire Op-IAP protein (Fig.2B). We then assayed whether expression of these mutated proteins could protect Sf21 cells against different apoptotic stimuli. Expression of the mutated proteins was verified by immunoblotting (Fig.3C), whereas transfection efficiency was monitored in each assay using a similar vector expressing eGFP and determining the percentage of fluorescent cells. It should be noted that the level of apoptosis observed upon transfection of wild type Op-IAP was essentially the same as the number of untransfected cells in this assay, suggesting that virtually all of the cells expressing wild type Op-IAP were protected.Figure 3The effect of mutations in either BIR1 or BIR2 of Op-IAP on protection against actinomycin D and Hid-induced apoptosis.A, constructs expressing the indicated mutated proteins were transfected into Sf21 cells, and the cells were then treated with actinomycin D to induce apoptosis, and the average percentage (± S.E.) of apoptotic cells was determined. The average transfection efficiency in all experiments was 67%.B, Sf21 cells were transfected with alacZ-expressing vector (negative control), or vectors expressing the indicated proteins were co-transfected with a Hid-expressing vector at a 1:1 ratio. The average number of apoptotic cells per high power field (± S.E.) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, lysates were prepared from Sf21 cells expressing the indicated proteins and analyzed for binding to the Hid peptide (pull down) as described in Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sf21 cells were transiently transfected with constructs expressing the respective point mutants, treated with actinomycin D to induce apoptosis, and apoptotic cell death was quantified (Fig.3A). All of the conserved residues mutated in both BIRs of Op-IAP were important for the anti-apoptotic function of this protein in the context of actinomycin D-induced death, with the notable exception of the C148A mutation, which for unknown reasons retained partial activity. The construct lacking BIR1 (B1D) also retained partial activity in this assay, whereas deletion of BIR2 (B2D) led to a complete loss of protection, suggesting that BIR2 is more important than BIR1 for protection against actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. However, whereas BIR2 appears to be crucial, the loss of BIR1 also reduced the ability of Op-IAP to protect against actinomycin D, indicating that BIR1 also contributes to protection against this death stimulus. To test the ability of the mutated proteins to inhibit another death signal that is less potent than actinomycin D, we co-transfected the mutated versions of Op-IAP with a vector expressing full-lengthDrosophila Hid at a ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 3B). In this assay, a greater difference was observed between point mutations in BIR1 and BIR2 than in the actinomycin D assay. Point mutations in BIR1, such as R21A, G42A, C54A, W64A, and the double mutant G42A/W64A, largely retained the ability to protect against Hid-induced death, whereas point mutations in BIR2, such as R114A, C148A, and H168A, showed significantly less protection, including the double mutation R21A/R114A, which behaved like a single mutation in BIR2 (compare R21A/R114A with R21A and R114A). Consistent with these results, deletion of BIR1 (B1D) had no effect on the ability of Op-IAP to protect against Hid-induced death, whereas deletion of BIR2 (B2D) resulted in decreased protection. However, deletion of BIR2 (B2D) did not result in total loss of anti-apoptotic activity when compared with the vector control, suggesting that BIR1 and/or the RING have some effect on Hid-induced apoptosis. Similar to the actinomycin D results, these results also suggest that BIR2 is more important than BIR1 in the anti-apoptotic activity of Op-IAP and corroborates results published previously (23Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33915-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We next correlated the anti-apoptotic activity of the mutated Op-IAP proteins with their ability to bind to the Hid peptide (Fig.3C). Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates showed that all of the mutant proteins were expressed at equivalent levels. All of the proteins containing mutations in invariant residues of BIR1 or BIR2 bound the Hid peptide, with the exception of R21A/R114A and C175A. In addition, reduced binding was observed for the C54A and H168A constructs. The C175A, C54A, and H168A constructs all contain mutations in zinc-coordinating residues in either BIR1 or BIR2, which might be expected to disrupt the folding of these domains. However, the fact that most of the mutant proteins still bound the Hid peptide indicates that they were not completely unfolded or misfolded as a result of the introduced mutations. As expected, B1D, which lacks the entire BIR1 domain, still bound the Hid peptide as well as wild type Op-IAP, whereas B2D (lacking BIR2) did not bind the Hid peptide (Fig.3C). Deletions in either of the sequences flanking BIR2 of Op-IAP (deletion of either residues 106–109 or 174–190) were shown previously to eliminate the protective function of BIR2 against Hid (23Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33915-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The 174–190 deletion also eliminated Hid binding, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal flanking sequence of BIR2 may be i"

To assess the possibility that WRN acts on partially melted DNA intermediates, we constructed a substrate containing a 21-nucleotide noncomplementary region asymmetrically positioned within a duplex DNA fragment. Purified WRN shows an extremely efficient exonuclease activity directed at both blunt ends of this substrate, whereas no activity is observed on a fully duplex substrate. High affinity binding of full-length WRN protects an area surrounding the melted region of the substrate from DNase I digestion.

In contrast, a WRN deletion mutant containing only the functional exonuclease domain does not detectably bind or degrade this substrate. These experiments indicate a bipartite structure and function for WRN, and we propose a model by which its DNA binding, helicase, and exonuclease activities function coordinately in DNA metabolism.

There are genes coding for at least five RecQ family members (RECQL, BLM, WRN, RECQ4/RTS, and RECQ5) in the human genome that are highly homologous to one another only within seven distinct sequence motifs that comprise a conserved helicase domain. The hereditary diseases known as Bloom, Werner, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes are the result of the loss of function of BLM, WRN, or RTS, respectively (3Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.-Z. Straughen J.

Although genomic instability is common to each of these diseases, the overall phenotype of each disease is different, indicating that the functions of BLM, WRN, and RTS are distinct or at least partially nonoverlapping. Interestingly, WRN is the only human RecQ protein to have an exonuclease domain in addition to the helicase domain (6Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The Werner syndrome (WS)1 phenotype is characterized by early onset of a number of aging characteristics, including graying and loss of hair, increased wrinkling and ulceration of the skin, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and an increased frequency of age-related maladies such as cancer, diabetes, and cataracts. WRN-deficient cells from WS patients have elevated levels of genomic instability typified by increased deletions, insertions, and translocations (7Fukuchi K.-I. Martin G.M. Monnat Jr., R.J. Proc.

Both the WS cellular phenotype and the WRN primary amino acid sequence point to a role in DNA metabolism that, when absent, results in large scale genetic change. A number of laboratories (including ours) have successfully overexpressed and purified a recombinant WRN protein, and its basic catalytic activities have been characterized. Consistent with the presence of ATPase/helicase amino acid sequence motifs in the central region of the protein, WRN is a DNA-dependent ATPase (11Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H.

In general, studies on WRN, BLM, and Sgs1 (the lone RecQ homolog inSaccharomyces cerevisiae) have shown remarkable similarities in helicase function and DNA substrate specificity (16Fry M. Loeb L.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This activity is directed to the 3′ end of a duplex substrate (3′ → 5′ directionality) preferably containing a 5′ overhang (recessed 3′ end) and has not been observed on single-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA with blunt ends or 3′ overhangs (25Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 28Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.-C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). On DNA substrates tested thus far, WRN exonuclease activity is dramatically stimulated by ATP hydrolysis (28Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.-C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), suggesting some cooperativity between the ATPase and exonuclease functions of WRN. However, exonuclease activity can be observed in the absence of ATP (28Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.-C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and mutant WRN proteins lacking either ATPase/helicase activity or the entire helicase domain still retain exonuclease activity (27Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2762-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that the exonuclease and helicase domains are functionally independent and, in all likelihood, physically separate. Importantly, the absence of exonuclease activity in the other human RecQ homologs suggests that the unique WS phenotype may be in part the result of loss of the specific exonuclease function of WRN. In this study, a defined DNA substrate containing an internal region of noncomplementarity was designed to closely approximate the localized melting of DNA duplexes that occurs during many metabolic processes. The DNA binding affinity and catalytic activities of recombinant wild type and mutant WRN proteins were examined on this substrate and compared with other model DNA substrates. We have demonstrated that, when compared with completely complementary substrates, a DNA substrate containing 21 unpaired nucleotides (nt) in both strands has extremely high affinity for the WRN protein. We have further characterized this binding and the effect of nucleotide cofactors by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) footprinting. We show that ATP hydrolysis is not required for high affinity binding of WRN to the melted region, and that the exonuclease domain does not bind stably to this substrate. Nevertheless, the WRN exonuclease function is highly active on this bubble substrate, and this activity is both independent of ATP binding or hydrolysis and further unwinding by WRN helicase function. Our results indicate coordination between the DNA binding and exonuclease domains of WRN and suggest that a noncomplementary (heteroduplex) or melted region of DNA could be the physiological substrate of WRN. Such structures may be indicative of DNA replication, recombination, or repair intermediates formed in vivo that require processing by WRN helicase and/or exonuclease activity. Recombinant wild type and mutant WRN proteins were overexpressed and purified essentially as described previously (29Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The WRN-K577M mutant contains a lysine to methionine point mutation at amino acid residue 577 in motif I of the conserved helicase domain; this protein lacks both ATPase and helicase activities (11Brosh Jr., R.M.

The WRN-E84A mutant contains a glutamate to alanine change at residue 84 in the conserved exonuclease domain that abolishes exonuclease activity (25Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The WRNΔ369–1432 contains only the N-terminal 368 amino acids of the full-length protein; however, this truncated protein possesses the entire conserved exonuclease domains and retains exonuclease activity (27Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2762-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The activities of wild type and mutant WRN proteins used in this study are summarized in Table I. All constructs contained an N-terminal hexahistidine tag to facilitate purification by metal (Ni2+) affinity chromatography. Briefly, Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9 strain) were infected with baculovirus containing WRN cDNA sequences at an multiplicity of infection of 10 and harvested 72–96 h after infection and stored at −80 °C. The wild type, WRN-K577M, and WRN-E84A proteins were purified by sequential liquid chromatographic steps using DEAE-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resins (29Orren D.K.

After cell lysis, WRNΔ369–1432 protein was bound to DEAE-Sepharose in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, chymostatin, and aprotinin, washed extensively with the same buffer minus Nonidet P-40, and eluted with the same buffer (minus Nonidet P-40) containing 60 mm NaCl. The DEAE eluate was then loaded directly onto and subsequently recovered from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, using washing and elution conditions identical to those described for full-length WRN proteins. Mock-infected insect cell lysates were purified in parallel to control for potential contaminating activities. All protein preparations were stored with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) at −80 °C until use.Table ICatalytic properties of wild type and mutant WRN proteinsProteinATP bindingATP hydrolysis3′ → 5′ helicase1-aWRN helicase and exonuclease activities are detectable from 25 to 37 °C, but not at 4 °C.3′ → 5′ exonuclease1-aWRN helicase and exonuclease activities are detectable from 25 to 37 °C, but not at 4 °C.WRN (wild type)++++WRN-K477M−1-bBased on comparison of WRN-K477M DNA binding and exonuclease assays carried out in the presence and absence of ATP, although actual ATP binding studies for this protein have not been done.−−+WRN-E84A+++−WRNΔ369–1432−1-cThis protein lacks the consensus nucleotide binding/hydrolysis domains present in RecQ homologs and presumably cannot bind or hydrolyze ATP.−1-cThis protein lacks the consensus nucleotide binding/hydrolysis domains present in RecQ homologs and presumably cannot bind or hydrolyze ATP.−+1-a WRN helicase and exonuclease activities are detectable from 25 to 37 °C, but not at 4 °C.1-b Based on comparison of WRN-K477M DNA binding and exonuclease assays carried out in the presence and absence of ATP, although actual ATP binding studies for this protein have not been done.1-c This protein lacks the consensus nucleotide binding/hydrolysis domains present in RecQ homologs and presumably cannot bind or hydrolyze ATP.

Phosphorothioate linkages between the 5′ end and 5′ penultimate nucleotides of the G80, G80bubble21, and C80 oligomers were included to inhibit the activity (5′ → 3′ nuclease) of a minor contaminant present in WRNΔ369–1432 preparations. The 5′ ends of these oligomers were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (60 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, 10 units) using standard methods. After removal of nonincorporated radionucleotide, the labeled oligomers were annealed with a 2-fold excess of their fully or partially complementary partners by heating to 90 °C for 5 min and slow cooling to room temperature (25 °C); C80 was annealed to either G80 or G80bubble21 to yield fully duplex or 21-nt bubble-containing substrate, respectively (Fig. 1). 5′ end-labeled 51-mer was annealed to unlabeled 57-mer to create a standard 5′ overhang substrate for WRN exonuclease activity. Partially and fully duplex substrates were separated from nonannealed and excess single-stranded DNAs by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%), eluted from gel slices using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and kept in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. The single-stranded character of the noncomplementary region of the bubble substrate was confirmed by localized incision of that region by S1 nuclease and by its ability to anneal with a fully complementary 21-nt oligomer (data not shown). DNA substrates (21-nt bubble or fully duplex, 32P-labeled on the C80 oligomer, 0.5 fmol each) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with WRN-E84A (30–240 fmol) in WRN reaction buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. ATP (1 mm) was added unless otherwise indicated. The reactions were terminated by addition of one-sixth volume of helicase stop dye (30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol). Samples were loaded onto a nondenaturing acrylamide (8%) gel that was run in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) at 120 V at 25 °C. After drying of the gels, visualization and quantitation were accomplished using a Storm 860 phosphorimaging system and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The band intensities (minus background) for the double-stranded and single-stranded DNA species were determined for WRN-treated and untreated reactions. Percentage of unwinding is calculated as the ratio (×100) of single-stranded species to the total amount of substrate in WRN-treated reactions, including subtraction of the low percentage of single-stranded species in untreated controls. In WRN reaction buffer either without ATP or including ATP or ATPγS (1 mm) where indicated,32P-labeled DNA substrates (∼0.5 fmol each) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with wild type or mutant WRN protein (2–600 fmol). The reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mmEDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol), and the DNA products were denatured at 90 °C for 5 min and separated by denaturing polyacrylamide (14%) gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE (1.5 h at 40 watts). Size markers were obtained by individual restriction enzyme (AluI, AvrII, BclI,BfaI, HindIII, or NspI) digestion of the appropriately radiolabeled bubble substrate (for restriction sites, see Fig. 1A) at 37 °C for 1 (partial) or 3 h. Individual digests were mixed in various combinations, heated to denature DNA products as above, and analyzed in parallel with exonuclease reactions. The gels were dried and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis as above. Exonuclease activity was assessed by comparing the band intensity of the undigested substrate remaining in treated samples with that of the untreated control. Fully duplex or bubble-containing substrate (32P-labeled, 0.5 fmol) was incubated with wild type WRN (12–72 fmol) or mock protein preparation (volume normalized) for 30 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (10 μl final volume) containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 4% Ficoll, and 1 mm ATPγS or ATP. After addition of one-sixth volume of native dye (30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol), samples were separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide (4%) gel electrophoresis carried out in 0.5× TBE at 140 V at 4 °C. Gels were vacuum-dried, and radioactivity associated with DNA and DNA-protein complexes was visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis. 32P-Labeled DNA substrates (21-nt bubble or completely complementary, 0.5 fmol each) were incubated with or without WRN wild type or mutant protein (WRNp, WRN-E84A, WRN-K577M, or WRNΔ369–1432) for 5–30 min at 4 °C or 37 °C in WRN reaction buffer (10-μl final volume). Where indicated, reactions also included 1 mm ATP or ATPγS. DNase I (1-μl volume, 0.015 units/reaction at 4 °C or 0.00015 units/reaction at 37 °C) was then added to the binding reactions followed by incubation at 0 °C or 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer. The digestion products of these reactions were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide (14%) gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE at 40 watts for 2 h and, as above, visualized using a phosphorimager after drying of gels. Size markers were generated as described above (see “Exonuclease Assay”). Most metabolic processes involving DNA (notably including replication, transcription, and nucleotide excision repair) take advantage of the ability of duplex DNA to be locally melted or unwound to allow access of additional DNA metabolizing enzymes. Although WRN alone does not appear to be capable of initiating the melting of fully duplex DNA, we felt it reasonable that a partially unwound region in the midst of fully duplex DNA might be a physiological substrate for WRN. For example, WRN helicase might assist in unwinding at a site that is already partially unwound and/or use an unwound region as an anchor to initiate degradation using its exonuclease function. Consistent with this rationale, various experimental findings have pointed to a role for WRN in DNA replication, recombination, repair, or transcription pathways (17Constantinou A. Tarsounas M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2655-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that involve localized melting of duplex DNA. To examine this possibility, we designed a duplex DNA substrate with an internal noncomplementary (bubble) region of 21 unpaired nucleotides on each strand that would somewhat mimic a melted DNA intermediate (Fig.1A). The noncomplementary region is asymmetrically positioned between duplex arms of 35 and 24 base pairs (bp). For the sake of reference in certain experiments, the individual strands will be identified as the G-rich and C-rich strands (Fig. 1A). This substrate was then subjected to unwinding, exonuclease, and DNA binding studies with wild type and mutant WRN proteins, using a fully duplex substrate (Fig. 1B) for comparison where appropriate. Because of the existence of both unwinding and exonuclease activities in wild type WRN, mutant proteins were used and/or conditions were manipulated such that the individual catalytic activities could be examined in isolation. For convenience, a comparison of the catalytic properties of the individual WRN proteins used in this study is presented in TableI. Enzymatic studies have demonstrated that WRN helicase requires a 3′ single-stranded region to the duplex region to be unwound and cannot act on fully duplex, blunt-ended substrates (13Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). We reasoned that providing WRN with an internal noncomplementary (bubble) region in the middle of a DNA substrate might satisfy the single-stranded DNA requirement of WRN helicase and might permit unwinding of an otherwise blunt-ended substrate to occur. We tested the ability of WRN to unwind our substrate containing an internal 21-nt bubble in comparison to fully complementary, blunt-ended double-stranded DNA. Because of the exonuclease activity of wild type WRN protein on these substrates (see below), helicase assays were carried out with WRN-E84A mutant protein, which completely lacks exonuclease activity but retains unwinding capability. The WRN-E84A mutant was able to unwind the 80-mer substrate containing a 21-nt bubble at WRN concentrations of 60 fmol and above (Fig.2A). Upon overexposure of gels, small amounts of slowly migrating forked structures were detected, corresponding to unwinding of a single duplex arm of the bubble substrate (data not shown). In contrast, WRN-E84A could not detectably unwind a completely complementary DNA substrate with blunt ends (Fig. 2C), in agreement with earlier reports (13Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The amount of helicase activity on the bubble substrate increased in a roughly proportional manner with increasing WRN concentration, whereas the fully duplex substrate was not unwound over the range of WRN concentration tested (Fig. 2D). The unwinding activity on the bubble-containing substrate was inherent in the recombinant WRN-E84A, as mock-purified protein did not detectably unwind this substrate (Fig. 2B). As expected, WRN-catalyzed unwinding of the bubble substrate requires ATP hydrolysis, as single-stranded products were not detectable in reactions lacking ATP (Fig.2B) or containing ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (data not shown). Furthermore, no unwinding activity was observed when reactions were incubated at 4 °C. Thus, WRN could unwind our bubble-containing substrate to some degree, but, by manipulating reaction conditions, unwinding could also be prevented in order that binding and exonuclease activities on the intact substrate can be examined unambiguously. In addition to its nucleic acid unwinding activity, WRN has also been demonstrated to possess an intrinsic 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity (25Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26Shen J.-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

This activity is associated with the N-terminal region of the protein, and, in fact, deletion mutants containing only the N-terminal 368 amino acids retain exonuclease activity (26Shen J.-C.
