In both rabbits and man the recovery of K in the urine averaged 30-35 per cent. This compares with an average recovery for F, G, and X of 74 per cent in rabbits and 91 per cent in man. In the treatment of experimental pneumococcal infections in white mice, an impure preparation of K was one-sixth as active as G and one-eighth as active as X. In the treatment of experimental streptococcal infections in white mice, a pure preparation of K was one-eleventh as active as G, and one-thirtieth as active as X. The above data suggest that penicillin K is inactivated in the body to a greater extent and more rapidly than either F, G, or X, resulting in a far lower therapeutic activity than would be anticipated from its bactericidal action in vitro. It seems clear that the amount of K in commercial penicillin should be minimized; and it would seem desirable to standardize impure mixtures of penicillins for therapeutic use by some method other than their bactericidal activity in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2095258783,"Feeding vitamin A at the rate of a million U.S.P. units daily to individual dairy cows in the latter stages of gestation augmented significantly the vitamin A concentration in the blood and the livers of their newborn calves, but pasture grazing, providing an abundance of carotene in the prepartum diet of the dams, failed to effect an increase over that observed in calves from dams restricted to a standard winter ration. The explanation for these divergent results is obscure, but it is suggested that the placental membrane may be more permeable to the ester form of vitamin A than to the alcohol form. This high initial vitamin A reserve in the newborn calf should have practical value in the maintenance of its postnatal health."

https://openalex.org/W31748903,"The general hypothesis as to the mode of action of chemotherapeutic agents, which has been formulated by Fildes, Woods, McIlwain, and others (2), offers a rational and useful guide to the design of new drugs. Thus, bacteriostasis is pictured as caused by the blocking of reactions essential to growth by an inhibiting substance which has a structure similar to that of one of the normal enzymes or metabolites essential to the growth of the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2063923919,IN former years parabiosis of a castrated rat with an intact one has been used in this and other laboratories for the study of the gonadotrophic functional condition of the hypophysis in situ freed from ovarian control. In the last four years we have made much use of a new method which allows the study of the gonadotrophic activity of the castrate hypophysis on the animal's own ovary.

https://openalex.org/W1996595483,"MANY of the recent advances in the application of infra-red spectroscopy to problems of molecular structure have been due to the greatly increased speed with which such spectra can be recorded. This makes it possible for the spectra of large numbers of compounds of known constitution to be compared, and so characteristic spectroscopic features of certain groupings can be established. While several spectrometers have been developed for recording an absorption spectrum (under moderately high resolving power) between 2 u and 15 u in a time of the order of half an hour, only one attempt1 appears to have been made to obtain ultra high-speed presentation of spectra on a cathode ray screen. Yet the advantages of such a method are very great, the most obvious, perhaps, being the possibility which is thus opened up of studying rapidly changing spectra, such as those encountered in chemical kinetics, in changes of physical state and in emission from transitory flames."

https://openalex.org/W2092811469,"Lingane and Loveridge1 have recently emphasized the desirability of using a capillary electrode with drop-time between one and six seconds in polarographic work. For a given tube, the -drop-time (Ï) is inversely proportional to the rate of flow of mercury (m), which may be increased by altering the height of the mercury reservoir or the dimensions of the capillary. The polarographic sensitivity (iD/C) is proportional to m2/3Ï/1/6, or, in terms of the rate of increase of surface area of the drop If the rate of flow of mercury is increased sufficiently, the mercury no longer issues from the orifice in discrete drops, but in a fine stream. It has been possible, however, by constructing a capillary tube with orifice larger than the bore higher in the tube, to use an increased rate of flow of mercury without simultaneously increasing the drop-time."

Owing to the intensity of the reaction it seemed worth while to estimate and identify pyruvic acid."

Mansfeld in a series of studies which have at last been summarized in his monograph on “The Hormones of the Thyroid Gland and their Actions” (Basle, 1943, Benno Schwabe and Co.). The principal results of these studies are as follow."

Four methods have been employed and their results correlated."

https://openalex.org/W1983611339,THE concept of probability has always comprised two ideas: that of frequency in an ensemble and that of reasonable expectation. Suppose it is said that in tossing an unbiased coin the probabilities of heads and tails are equal. It is implied that the fraction of tosses giving heads will be the same as the fraction giving tails in a large enough number of tosses. It is implied also that in a single trial there is as much reason to expect one result as the other. The choice of one or the other of these ideas as the primary meaning of probability distinguishes the two main schools of thought in the field.

https://openalex.org/W2052518486,"CONSIDERABLE interest has been taken in the phenomenon of 'stepped' breakdown in the electric spark, and experimental investigations have been made, notably by Tamm1 and others2, using oscillographic records of the collapse of voltage across the gap. Studies have also been made by Raether3 of the growth of the space charges in the gap, using the cloud-chamber method. These experiments were mainly concerned with short gaps of the parallel-plate type in air at reduced densities. In many practical applications of short spark gaps, however, high gas densities are required, and if similar effects are found to occur at these high gas densities, any 'stepping' of the voltage across the gap during the initial phase of the breakdown can have serious consequences in that complete breakdown of the gas insulation is prevented. The gap can thus develop an appreciable resistance in which considerable power may be dissipated. The occurrence of this effect would render the spark gap useless in those circuits which require sudden surges of high peak-current through a low-resistance path."
