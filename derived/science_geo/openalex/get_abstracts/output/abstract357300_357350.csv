https://openalex.org/W2079205293,"Increasing evidence suggests that islet cell transplantation for patients with type I diabetes holds great promise for achieving insulin independence. However, the extreme shortage of matched organ donors and the necessity for chronic immunosuppression has made it impossible for this treatment to be used for the general diabetic population. Recent success in generating insulin-secreting islet-like cells from human embryonic stem (ES) cells, in combination with the success in deriving human ES cell-like induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from human fibroblasts by defined factors, have raised the possibility that patient-specific insulin-secreting islet-like cells might be derived from somatic cells through cell fate reprogramming using defined factors. Here we confirm that human ES-like iPS cells can be derived from human skin cells by retroviral expression of OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4. Importantly, using a serum-free protocol, we successfully generated insulin-producing islet-like clusters (ILCs) from the iPS cells under feeder-free conditions. We demonstrate that, like human ES cells, skin fibroblast-derived iPS cells have the potential to be differentiated into islet-like clusters through definitive and pancreatic endoderm. The iPS-derived ILCs not only contain C-peptide-positive and glucagon-positive cells but also release C-peptide upon glucose stimulation. Thus, our study provides evidence that insulin-secreting ILCs can be generated from skin fibroblasts, raising the possibility that patient-specific iPS cells could potentially provide a treatment for diabetes in the future.

Diabetes is a life-long disease defined by hyperglycemia. Although type I diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic endocrine beta cells of the patient, type II diabetes results from insulin resistance. Although current treatment for type I diabetes is obliged to rely on insulin injection, due to the difficulties in adjusting the amounts of insulin administration to accommodate fluctuations in physiological conditions, this treatment often results in episodes of hypo- and hyperglycemia. Even under strictly controlled conditions, such treatment delays but does not always prevent development of multiple complications including microvascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (1Efrat S. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2008; 60: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Regeneration of insulin-producing beta cell as well as islet transplantation are the most promising long term solutions for diabetes treatment (1Efrat S. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2008; 60: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For example, clinical trials with islet cell transplantation from cadaver donors have resulted in promising outcomes (2Lakey J.R. Mirbolooki M. Shapiro A.M. Methods Mol.

Insulin independence with good glycemic control was achieved and sustained in some patients for more than 2 years. Although promising, this approach faces multiple challenges. A major obstacle is the shortage of donors when compared with the large patient population. In addition, because the low yield of islet cells from cadaver tissue, it requires large number of donor cells to generate sufficient insulin-producing beta cells that are capable of producing and releasing adequate amounts of insulin in response to normal physiological signals (2Lakey J.R. Mirbolooki M. Shapiro A.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 333: 47-104PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shapiro A.M. Ricordi C. Hering B.J. Auchincloss H. Lindblad R. Robertson R.P. Secchi A. Brendel M.D. Berney T.

These factors have made it impossible for this treatment to be used for the general diabetic population. Although the recurring autoimmune response has to be prevented to avoid destruction of the transplanted cells, derivation of patient-specific islet-like cells from adult tissues may allow both shortage of organ donors and allograft rejection to be resolved. However, generation of functional islet-like clusters (ILCs) 4The abbreviations used are: ILC, islet-like clusters; ES, embryonic stem; hES, human ES; iPS, induced pluripotent stem; HESM, human embryonic stem cells medium; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin. from adult progenitor cells including pancreatic progenitor cells has been tested with limited success (5Sapir T.

When compared with adult progenitor cells, human ES cells remain the most promising source for ILC generation due to their unlimited replicative capacity and differentiation potentials. Recent studies have proved that human ES cells can be differentiated into functional islet-like clusters using an in vitro differentiation protocol, although the efficiency is relatively low (8Jiang J. Au M. Lu K. Eshpeter A. Korbutt G. Fisk G. Majumdar A.S. Stem Cells (Durham). 2007; 25: 1940-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, transplantation of pancreatic endoderm derived from human ES cells in vitro can rescue mice with induced insulin deficiency (9Kroon E. Martinson L.A. Kadoya K. Bang A.G. Kelly O.G.

However, the application of human ES cell-derived ILC was largely restricted by generation of patient specific ES cells. Recent demonstrations that human ES cell-like induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from adult human somatic cells by enforced expression of defined transcription factors (10Lowry W.E.

Here we confirm that human ES-like iPS cells can be derived from skin cells by retroviral expression of OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4. Importantly, using a serum-free in vitro protocol, we successfully generated insulin-producing ILCs from the iPS cells. Our studies thus raise the possibility that patient-specific iPS cells could potentially provide an alternative source for drug screen, study for disease mechanisms, and cell therapy for diabetes in the future. Plasmid Construction and Retroviruses Production—The human Oct4, Sox2, Klf-4, and c-Myc cDNAs were PCR-amplified from expressed sequence tag clones and cloned into pMXs at blunted BstXI sites (15Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T. Kumagai H. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate retroviruses expressing the four factors, pGag-pol, pVSVG, and pMXs were co-transfected into 293T cells on one 6-well plate at cell density of 8.0 × 105 cells/well using SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Six hours after transfection, the medium was changed to complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium. The viruses were harvest 48 and 72 h after transfection. The harvested viruses were filtered through 0.45-μm filter membrane (Millipore) and concentrated by spin column (Millipore). Generation and Culture of Human iPS Cells—A total of 8 × 105 human foreskin fibroblast HFF-1 cells on one 10-cm plate were transduced with concentrated retroviruses with Polybrene (8 μg/ml) two times sequentially. Four days after the second transduction, 5 × 104 cells were transferred onto mitomycin-C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells. On the second day, the medium was changed to HESM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% knock-out serum replacement and supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/ml)). Colonies began to appear 9 days after the second transduction and were picked based on their morphology on days 16, 23, and 30 after transduction. iPS cell lines and the human ES cell line H9 (WiCell) were maintained as described previously (WiCell protocols) on mitomycin-treated primary MEF in HESM (Invitrogen) containing nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, 2-mercapthoethanol, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech) or on fibronectin (Sigma) using MEF-conditioned HESM. iPS cells were initially propagated manually and by enzymatic digestion with collagenase IV (Invitrogen) at later passages. Immunostaining and TUNEL Assay—iPS cells cultured on MEFs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocked in 1% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, they were incubated with Alexa Fluor (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies and DAPI for 1 h. SSEA-1, SSEA-4, TRA-1–60, SOX2, and OCT4 antibodies were obtained from Millipore. Alkaline phosphatase staining was done according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Millipore). For immunostaining of differentiated cells, cell clusters were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100, and blocked with sera/phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The sources of the primary antibodies are: mouse anti-SOX17 (R&D), goat anti-Foxa2 (R&D), goat anti-PDX1 (AbCam), mouse anti-C-peptide (AbCam), and rabbit anti-glucagon (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-labeled second antibody was used, and DAPI or Draq5 were used for nuclear staining. Images were captured under a fluorescent microscope or by confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). The TUNEL assay of the islet-like clusters under high glucose was performed using an ApopTag kit (Chemicon), and the clusters were double-stained with anti-C-peptide antibody. Real-time RT-PCR and Bisulfite Sequencing Analysis—Total RNA from H9 and iPS cells cultured on fibronectin or under the differentiation conditions were isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Following DNase I treatment, reverse transcription was performed using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega). Real-time PCR reactions were performed with SYBR GreenER mix (Invitrogen) using primer sets listed in supplemental Table 1. Relative gene expression levels were normalized to actin mRNA. Bisulfite sequencing was performed as described previously with minor modifications (16Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA samples was subjected to nested PCR amplification. The PCR products were subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). All PCR and subcloning reactions were performed in duplicate for each sample. The clones were sequenced using an M13 reverse primer. Teratoma Formation and Analysis—Teratoma formation was completed using an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol. Approximately 2 × 106 iPS cells cultured on MEFs were collected manually by scrapping, resuspended in a mixture of HESM and Matrigel (ratio of 1:1), and injected subcutaneously into the hind skin flap or intramuscularly into the hind limb of 2–3-month-old immune-compromised Rag2-/-/gamma-C-/- mice. Xenografted masses were observed 4–6 weeks after injection and dissected 6 weeks after injection. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and processed for hematoxylin and eosin and immunofluorescent staining. The antibodies against the following proteins were used for immunostaining: nestin (BD Biosciences), cytokeratin 19 (AbCam), α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma), and smooth muscle myosin (Biomedical Technologies). In Vitro Differentiation of Insulin-secreting Islet-like Clusters—In vitro differentiation of insulin-secreting islet-like cluster cells was performed using a protocol described previously with slight modifications (8Jiang J. Au M. Lu K. Eshpeter A. Korbutt G. Fisk G. Majumdar A.S. Stem Cells (Durham). 2007; 25: 1940-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated iPS and hES cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 11.1 mm glucose, and 4 nm activin A (Peprotech) for 7 days. Sodium butyrate was added on day 1 at a final concentration of 0.1 mm (stage 1). After stage 1, the cells were dissociated with treatment of 1 μg/ml collagenase IV at 37 °C for 5 min and transferred into ultra-low attachment six-well plates (Corning). The cell aggregates were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with B27, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 2 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 100 ng/ml noggin (Peprotech) for 2 weeks (stage 2). At stage 3, cell clusters were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 supplemented with B27, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 100 ng/ml Noggin (Peprotech) for 1 week. Finally, the cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm nicotinamide, and 50 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor II for 5 days and without insulin-like growth factor II for another 2 days (stage 4). Glucose-stimulated Insulin Release Assay—Insulin secretion analysis was performed as described previously (8Jiang J. Au M. Lu K. Eshpeter A. Korbutt G. Fisk G. Majumdar A.S. Stem Cells (Durham). 2007; 25: 1940-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Cell clusters after stage 4 were attached to a Matrigel-coated plate and were washed with glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were first incubated with RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.8 mm glucose for 3 h, at which point the supernatant was collected. The cells were then treated with RPMI 1640 medium containing 40 mm glucose for another 3 h. The C-peptide levels in the supernatants were measured using the Mercodia ultrasensitive human C-peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, and the total amount of C-peptide in the supernatants was normalized according to the DNA content of islet-like clusters. Generation of iPS Cells from Human Foreskin Fibroblasts—Recent studies indicate that ES-like pluripotent iPS cells can be generated through ectopic expression of defined transcription factors in differentiated mouse and human cells (10Lowry W.E.

Nature. 2007; 448: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). Although human iPS cells are capable of generating all three germ layers in mice, whether they can differentiate into cells of pancreatic endocrine lineages is not known. To address this question, we attempted to generate human iPS cells by retroviral expression of human Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc in the HFF-1 human foreskin fibroblast cells. To this end, we expressed the four transcription factors in the HFF-1 foreskin fibroblasts by retroviral transduction. Colonies were visible 9 days after the second transduction, and about 80–100 colonies were observed at day 16 from the initial 5 × 104 cells seeded in each 10-cm plate. A total of 26 colonies, picked on days 16, 23, and 30 after transduction, were propagated in hES cell culture medium on primary MEFs and passaged manually every 5–6 days. From the 26 colonies picked, we successfully established nine iPS cell lines (see below). Characterization of Human iPS Cells—Each of the nine iPS cell clones exhibited and maintained morphology distinct from the original human fibroblasts and resembled hES cells for at least 14 passages in culture (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). The various iPS clones propagated at a similar rate but varied in their percentage of spontaneous differentiation during culture. To confirm that these iPS cells exhibit hES-like properties, we examined a number of hES cell markers that include alkaline phosphatase activity, ES cell-specific transcription factors Sox2 and Oct4, and hES cell-specific extracellular antigens TRA-1–60 and SSEA-4. As a negative control, we also analyzed SSEA-1, a marker for differentiation of hES cells. Results shown in Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1 demonstrate that the iPS clones exhibit hES-like properties, including high alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, and positive staining for Sox2, Oct4, TRA-1–60, and SSEA-4. The majority of the colonies were negative for the SSEA-1, with a few positive cells observed on the periphery of some colonies. Staining intensity for all markers tested was similar to that observed with the well characterized hES cell line H9 (supplemental Fig. S1). The original HFF-1 fibroblast cell line was negative for these markers (supplemental Fig. S1). To assess the gene expression pattern of the iPS clones, we isolated RNA from iPS cells that were cultured under feeder-free conditions for at least two passages. All of the selected clones maintained the morphological characteristics observed for hES cell lines when cultured on fibronectin or similar matrixes (data not shown). RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of the genes essential for hES cell maintenance, including Nanog, Crypto, telomerase (TERT), Rex1, Dppa5, UTF1, TERF1, TERF2, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), and Glut1 glucose transporter. None of these genes were expressed in the original HFF-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). Expression of other genes such as ABCG2, Cx43, Cx45, LifaR, and gp130, which play more general roles in cell maintenance, was maintained in both iPS cells and the parental fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). RT-PCR analysis using primers that only amplify endogenous Sox2 and Oct4 genes confirmed activation of these loci (supplemental Fig. S2). Previous studies have established a tight connection between the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming and the DNA methylation status of the Oct4 promoter (21Simonsson S. Gurdon J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the DNA methylation status of the Oct4 promoter by bisulfite sequencing. Results shown in Fig. 1D demonstrate that, similar to the H9 hES cells, the promoter of Oct4 is hypomethylated in the iPS cells, which is in stark contrast to the heavy degree of methylation observed in the original HFF-1 fibroblasts, further supporting successful reprogramming. To confirm the multipotency of the human iPS cells, we injected five lines of iPS cells subcutaneously or intramuscularly into Rag2-/-/gamma-C-/- mice. Teratomas formed 4–6 weeks after injection. H&E and immunostaining of tumor sections from teratomas dissected 6 weeks after injection demonstrated the presence of cell types of all three germ layers (Fig. 2A), including neural and non-neural ectoderm (Fig. 2, B and C), pigmented epithelium (Fig. 2D), smooth muscle and fat tissue (mesoderm) (Fig. 2, D and E), and airway and gut-like epithelial tissues (endoderm, Fig. 2F). Collectively, the above results demonstrate that the cell lines that we generated exhibit all the features of blastocyst-derived human ES cells and are therefore qualified to be human iPS cells. Differentiation of iPS Cells into Insulin-secreting Islet Clusters—Having confirmed the multipotency of the iPS cells, we asked whether they are capable of differentiating into the pancreatic endocrine lineage as successful generation of insulin-secreting cells has great potential in the development of regenerative therapy for diabetes. To address this possibility, we adapted a recently developed serum-free differentiation procedure from which hES cells have been successfully differentiated into insulin-secreting islet-like clusters (8Jiang J. Au M. Lu K. Eshpeter A. Korbutt G. Fisk G. Majumdar A.S. Stem Cells (Durham). 2007; 25: 1940-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Four randomly chosen iPS cell lines, numbers 1, 3, 7, and 8, and the hES H9 cell line were subjected to the four-stage differentiation procedure outlined in Fig. 3A. Although all four iPS cell lines express human ES cell markers (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S1), only iPS lines 3 and 7 survived the differentiation procedures, indicating that iPS lines 1 and 8 may not be truly multipotent. As reported previously, activin A and sodium butyrate treatment leads to considerable morphological change of hES cells (Fig. 3B, panels a and d). Similar morphological changes were also observed for the iPS cells 3 and 7 (Fig. 3B, panels b and e and panels c and f). After stage 2, those cells, from either hES or iPS cells, formed cellular aggregates under low attachment conditions (Fig. 3B, panels g–i). By stage 4, the aggregates became fused to each other, and some small bud-like clusters appeared (Fig. 3B, panels j–l, arrows). The results suggest that iPS clones 3 and 7 undergo similar morphological changes to those of hES cells in response to the pancreatic cell lineage differentiation procedure. To determine whether these morphological changes reflect successful differentiation of both hES and iPS cells into pancreatic cell lineages, we analyzed the gene expression pattern of pancreatic lineages at each stage of the differentiation process by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4A, the definitive endoderm-specific genes, such as Foxa2 and Sox17, are expressed at high levels after completion of stage 1. After treatment with basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and noggin, expression of Pdx1, markers of pancreatic lineage cells, is readily detectable. At stage 3, NKX6.1, Ptf1, and insulin mRNAs are detectable, and insulin mRNA reaches the highest level at stage 4. Importantly, both iPS line 3 and iPS line 7 in general exhibited similar gene expression profiles as that of the human H9 ES cells, indicating that iPS cells and hES cells have similar differentiation potential for endoderm pancreatic lineage. To further confirm expression of key genes during the differentiation process, we analyzed protein expression of Foxa2 and Sox17 in stage 1, Pdx1 in stage 2, and C-peptide and glucagon in stage 4 by immunostaining. Results shown in Fig. 4B demonstrate that activin A and sodium butyrate induced the expression of Foxa2 and Sox17 in the nuclei of iPS cells as well as hES cells (Fig. 4B, panels a–f). In addition, Pdx1 protein was clearly detected in cells derived from both hES and iPS cells after stage 2 (Fig. 4B, panels g–i). Finally, both C-peptide and glucagon-positive cells were detected in the cells of stage 4 (Fig. 4B, panels j–r). Consistent with a previous report (8Jiang J. Au M. Lu K. Eshpeter A. Korbutt G. Fisk G. Majumdar A.S. Stem Cells (Durham). 2007; 25: 1940-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), the expression of pancreatic hormones was predominantly localized in the small budding clusters. Therefore, we conclude that, similar to hES cells, the iPS cells derived from foreskin fibroblasts can be differentiated into islet-like endocrine cells. Next we performed a functional test for the differentiated islet-like clusters. To this end, we measured insulin secretion upon glucose stimulation using C-peptide enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. At low glucose concentration (2.8 mm), levels of insulin secretion, as measured by the level of C-peptide, are comparable among islet-like cells derived from hES and iPS cells (Fig. 5A). At high glucose concentration (40 mm), hES cell-derived islet-like cells responded to glucose stimulation (Fig. 5A) (8Jiang J. Au M. Lu K. Eshpeter A. Korbutt G. Fisk G. Majumdar A.S. Stem Cells (Durham). 2007; 25: 1940-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Importantly, isletlike cells derived from iPS clone 3 also responded to high glucose stimulation by insulin secretion, although the response from iPS clone 7 is marginal (Fig. 5A). Previous studies indicate that long time exposure to high concentration glucose can cause apoptosis of human islet cells (22Federici M. Hribal M. Perego L. Ranalli M. Caradonna Z. Perego C. Usellini L. Nano R. Bonini P. Bertuzzi F. Marlier L.N. Davalli A.M. Carandente O. Pontiroli A.E. Melino G. Marchetti P. Lauro R. Sesti G. Folli F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the increased levels of C-peptide in the supernatant under high glucose concentration were caused by increased cell death, we examined apoptosis of insulin-positive cells by TUNEL assay. Results shown in Fig. 5B demonstrate that most C-peptide-positive cells were TUNEL-negative, thus ruling out the possibility that the increased release of C-peptide after high glucose treatment is related to apoptosis. Therefore, we conclude that iPS cells, like hES cells, have the potential to differentiate into functional islet-like clusters in vitro, although clonal variation exists. We note that although the two iPS lines used in our differentiation protocol exhibited no noticeable difference from the H9 hES cells in terms of marker gene expression and teratomas formation, the islet-like clusters generated from them exhibited quantitative differences in glucose response. It is possible that variation in transgene copy number and/or their degree of silencing (supplemental Fig. S2) might contribute to the observed differences. However, more extensive studies are needed to determine the basis of the variation. We note that similar variations in the differentiation potential of different hES cell lines have been reported (23Osafune K. Caron L. Borowiak M. Martinez R.J. Fitz-Gerald C.S. Sato Y. Cowan C.A.

This technical breakthrough has significant implications for overcoming the ethical issues associated with hES cell derivation from human embryos. In addition, it also makes the generation of patient-specific multipotent stem cells possible. Despite the fact that several safety issues, such as oncogenic and viral integration, which has been associated with genome instability, must be overcome before iPS technology can be used in patients, the implication of this technology in replacement therapy is far reaching. Among all the diseases that can be potentially treated by cell therapy, type I diabetes is one of the most attractive candidates as pancreatic transplantation or islet infusion has shown great promise in achieving independence from insulin injection (2Lakey J.R. Mirbolooki M. Shapiro A.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 333: 47-104PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shapiro A.M. Ricordi C. Hering B.J. Auchincloss H. Lindblad R. Robertson R.P. Secchi A. Brendel M.D. Berney T.

We demonstrated that the iPS cells derived from human skin cells can be differentiated into pancreatic ILCs. Our results provided evidence that functional endocrine cells can be generated in vitro from human somatic cells. Given that islet cell transplantation therapy has been proven to be beneficial to patients with type I diabetes (2Lakey J.R. Mirbolooki M. Shapiro A.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 333: 47-104PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shapiro A.M. Ricordi C. Hering B.J. Auchincloss H. Lindblad R. Robertson R.P. Secchi A. Brendel M.D. Berney T. Brennan D.C. Cagliero E. Alejandro R.

Seyfert-Margolis V. Bluestone J. Lakey J.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar), generation of patient-specific iPS cells and subsequent differentiation of these iPS cells into insulin-secreting cells may prove to be a potential cell source for transplantation therapy. However, before this approach can become practical, several obstacles must be overcome. First, although the iPS cells and human ES cells have comparable efficiency of differentiation into insulin-secreting islet clusters, the general efficiency is extremely low. In addition, the levels of C-peptide secreted by in vitro differentiated islet-like cells from both iPS cells and human ES cells are much lower when compared with that of adult human β-cells. The low efficiency of these two aspects is caused by the limitation of current in vitro differential protocol but not the intrinsic properties of the iPS cells. For this reason, it is essential to establish efficient differentiation procedures that significantly increase the formation of insulin-secreting cells and their response to glucose. One approach that has shown great promise is in vivo maturation of endocrine cells through transplantation of in vitro differentiated pancreatic endoderm cells (9Kroon E. Martinson L.A. Kadoya K. Bang A.G. Kelly O.G. Eliazer S. Young H. Richardson M. Smart N.G. Cunningham J. Agulnick A.D. D'Amour K.A. Carpenter M.K. Baetge E.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Second, since type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease, the iPS-derived insulin-producing cells can be attacked by the autoreactive T cells. Although the immunological problem is serious, the self-renewal capacity of iPS cells might partially address the continuous retreatment of the disease by the availability of autologous iPS-derived cells without sensitization by donor tissues, which is one of the major problems in repeated infusion of islets derived from multiple donors (25Campbell P.M. Senior P.A. Salam A. Labranche K. Bigam D.L. Kneteman N.M. Imes S. Halpin A. Ryan E.A. Shapiro A.M. Am. J. Transplant. 2007; 7: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Third, the obvious obstacles for iPS cell-based therapy that are associated with the reprogramming process, such as the introduction of the oncogenes and possible mutations due to the use of integrating viral vectors, must also be overcome. Given the amazing progress that has been made in the past 2 years, we anticipate that it will not be long before these obstacles are resolved. It is worth noting that although individual iPS cell clones showed no significant difference in cell morphology, expression of pluripotent marker genes, or DNA demethylation at the Oct4 promoter, we observed clonal variability in their potential to differentiate into the pancreatic lineage cells. Of the four iPS cell clones that we tested in the same differentiation procedure, two iPS clone failed to maintain islet-like cell aggregates (data not shown). The clonal variability in terms of differentiation potential indicates that not all human iPS clones are fully pluripotent although they passed the standard tests. This raises the question regarding the criteria for “true” human iPS cells. Because the differentiation protocol used in this study has clearly defined developmental stages, we will be able to define the specific blockage of the differentiation process for some of the “incompletely” reprogrammed clones. This information, in combination with other factors, such as epigenetic modifications and microRNA profiling, might help us to establish the criteria for true human iPS cells with full differentiation potential.

https://openalex.org/W2153359504,"Value estimates of ecosystem goods and services are useful to justify the allocation of resources towards conservation, but inconclusive estimates risk unsustainable resource allocations. Here we present replacement costs as a more accurate value estimate of insect pollination as an ecosystem service, although this method could also be applied to other services. The importance of insect pollination to agriculture is unequivocal. However, whether this service is largely provided by wild pollinators (genuine ecosystem service) or managed pollinators (commercial service), and which of these requires immediate action amidst reports of pollinator decline, remains contested. If crop pollination is used to argue for biodiversity conservation, clear distinction should be made between values of managed- and wild pollination services. Current methods either under-estimate or over-estimate the pollination service value, and make use of criticised general insect and managed pollinator dependence factors. We apply the theoretical concept of ascribing a value to a service by calculating the cost to replace it, as a novel way of valuing wild and managed pollination services. Adjusted insect and managed pollinator dependence factors were used to estimate the cost of replacing insect- and managed pollination services for the Western Cape deciduous fruit industry of South Africa. Using pollen dusting and hand pollination as suitable replacements, we value pollination services significantly higher than current market prices for commercial pollination, although lower than traditional proportional estimates. The complexity associated with inclusive value estimation of pollination services required several defendable assumptions, but made estimates more inclusive than previous attempts. Consequently this study provides the basis for continued improvement in context specific pollination service value estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2066239994,"H9N2 avian influenza viruses continue to circulate worldwide; in Asia, H9N2 viruses have caused disease outbreaks and established lineages in land-based poultry. Some H9N2 strains are considered potentially pandemic because they have infected humans causing mild respiratory disease. In addition, some of these H9N2 strains replicate efficiently in mice without prior adaptation suggesting that H9N2 strains are expanding their host range. In order to understand the molecular basis of the interspecies transmission of H9N2 viruses, we adapted in the laboratory a wildtype duck H9N2 virus, influenza A/duck/Hong Kong/702/79 (WT702) virus, in quail and chickens through serial lung passages. We carried out comparative analysis of the replication and transmission in quail and chickens of WT702 and the viruses obtained after 23 serial passages in quail (QA23) followed by 10 serial passages in chickens (QA23CkA10). Although the WT702 virus can replicate and transmit in quail, it replicates poorly and does not transmit in chickens. In contrast, the QA23CkA10 virus was very efficient at replicating and transmitting in quail and chickens. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the QA23 and QA23CkA10 viruses compared to the WT702 virus indicated several nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino acid changes within the surface and internal proteins. In addition, a 21-amino acid deletion was found in the stalk of the NA protein of the QA23 virus and was maintained without further modification in the QA23CkA10 adapted virus. More importantly, both the QA23 and the QA23CkA10 viruses, unlike the WT702 virus, were able to readily infect mice, produce a large-plaque phenotype, showed faster replication kinetics in tissue culture, and resulted in the quick selection of the K627 amino acid mammalian-associated signature in PB2. These results are in agreement with the notion that adaptation of H9 viruses to land-based birds can lead to strains with expanded host range."

https://openalex.org/W1963981927,"Giant honeybees (Apis dorsata) nest in the open and have evolved a plethora of defence behaviors. Against predatory wasps, including hornets, they display highly coordinated Mexican wave-like cascades termed 'shimmering'. Shimmering starts at distinct spots on the nest surface and then spreads across the nest within a split second whereby hundreds of individual bees flip their abdomens upwards. However, so far it is not known whether prey and predator interact and if shimmering has anti-predatory significance. This article reports on the complex spatial and temporal patterns of interaction between Giant honeybee and hornet exemplified in 450 filmed episodes of two A. dorsata colonies and hornets (Vespa sp.). Detailed frame-by-frame analysis showed that shimmering elicits an avoidance response from the hornets showing a strong temporal correlation with the time course of shimmering. In turn, the strength and the rate of the bees' shimmering are modulated by the hornets' flight speed and proximity. The findings suggest that shimmering creates a 'shelter zone' of around 50 cm that prevents predatory wasps from foraging bees directly from the nest surface. Thus shimmering appears to be a key defence strategy that supports the Giant honeybees' open-nesting life-style."
https://openalex.org/W2059556576,"Background According to the WHO, more than 1 billion people worldwide are overweight and at risk of developing chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and stroke. Current therapies show limited efficacy and are often associated with unpleasant side-effect profiles, hence there is a medical need for new therapeutic interventions in the field of obesity. Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP, also known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) has recently been postulated to link over-nutrition with obesity. In fact GIP receptor-deficient mice (GIPR−/−) were shown to be completely protected from diet-induced obesity. Thus, disrupting GIP signaling represents a promising novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to block GIP signaling we chose an active vaccination approach using GIP peptides covalently attached to virus-like particles (VLP-GIP). Vaccination of mice with VLP-GIP induced high titers of specific antibodies and efficiently reduced body weight gain in animals fed a high fat diet. The reduction in body weight gain could be attributed to reduced accumulation of fat. Moreover, increased weight loss was observed in obese mice vaccinated with VLP-GIP. Importantly, despite the incretin action of GIP, VLP-GIP-treated mice did not show signs of glucose intolerance. Conclusions/Significance This study shows that vaccination against GIP was safe and effective. Thus active vaccination may represent a novel, long-lasting treatment for obesity. However further preclinical safety/toxicology studies will be required before the therapeutic concept can be addressed in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2054976402,"Bone mass is maintained by continuous remodeling through repeated cycles of bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. This remodeling process is regulated by many systemic and local factors.We identified collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (Cthrc1) as a downstream target of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) in osteochondroprogenitor-like cells by PCR-based suppression subtractive hybridization followed by differential hybridization, and found that Cthrc1 was expressed in bone tissues in vivo. To investigate the role of Cthrc1 in bone, we generated Cthrc1-null mice and transgenic mice which overexpress Cthrc1 in osteoblasts (Cthrc1 transgenic mice). Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and bone histomorphometry analyses showed that Cthrc1-null mice displayed low bone mass as a result of decreased osteoblastic bone formation, whereas Cthrc1 transgenic mice displayed high bone mass by increase in osteoblastic bone formation. Osteoblast number was decreased in Cthrc1-null mice, and increased in Cthrc1 transgenic mice, respectively, while osteoclast number had no change in both mutant mice. In vitro, colony-forming unit (CFU) assays in bone marrow cells harvested from Cthrc1-null mice or Cthrc1 transgenic mice revealed that Cthrc1 stimulated differentiation and mineralization of osteoprogenitor cells. Expression levels of osteoblast specific genes, ALP, Col1a1, and Osteocalcin, in primary osteoblasts were decreased in Cthrc1-null mice and increased in Cthrc1 transgenic mice, respectively. Furthermore, BrdU incorporation assays showed that Cthrc1 accelerated osteoblast proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, overexpression of Cthrc1 in the transgenic mice attenuated ovariectomy-induced bone loss.Our results indicate that Cthrc1 increases bone mass as a positive regulator of osteoblastic bone formation and offers an anabolic approach for the treatment of osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2087675721,"SepF (Septum Forming) protein has been recently identified through genetic studies, and it has been suggested to be involved in the division of Bacillus subtilis cells. We have purified functional B. subtilis SepF from the inclusion bodies overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Far-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis involving the extrinsic fluorescent probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid suggested that the purified SepF had characteristics of folded proteins. SepF was found to promote the assembly and bundling of FtsZ protofilaments using three complimentary techniques, namely 90 degrees light scattering, sedimentation, and transmission electron microscopy. SepF also decreased the critical concentration of FtsZ assembly, prevented the dilution-induced disassembly of FtsZ protofilaments, and suppressed the GTPase activity of FtsZ. Further, thick bundles of FtsZ protofilaments were observed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled SepF (FITC-SepF). Interestingly, FITC-SepF was found to be uniformly distributed along the length of the FtsZ protofilaments, suggesting that SepF copolymerizes with FtsZ. SepF formed a stable complex with FtsZ, as evident from the gel filtration analysis. Using a C-terminal tail truncated FtsZ (FtsZDelta16) and a C-terminal synthetic peptide of B. subtilis FtsZ (366-382); we provided evidence indicating that SepF binds primarily to the C-terminal tail of FtsZ. The present work in concert with the available in vivo data support a model in which SepF plays an important role in regulating the assembly dynamics of the divisome complex; therefore, it may have an important role in bacterial cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1997222184,"Diarrhea is widespread in intestinal diseases involving ischemia and/or hypoxia. Since hypoxia alters stimulated Cl(-) and water flux, we investigated the influence of such a physiologically and pathophysiologically important signal on expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Located on the apical membrane, this cAMP-activated Cl(-) channel determines salt and fluid transport across mucosal surfaces. Our studies revealed depression of CFTR mRNA, protein, and function in hypoxic epithelia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified a previously unappreciated binding site for the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and promoter studies established its relevance by loss of repression following point mutation. Consequently, HIF-1 overexpressing cells exhibited significantly reduced transport capacity in colorimetric Cl(-) efflux studies, altered short circuit measurements, and changes in transepithelial fluid movement. Whole-body hypoxia in wild-type mice resulted in significantly reduced small intestinal fluid and HCO(3)(-) secretory responses to forskolin. Experiments performed in Cftr(-/-) and Nkcc1(-/-) mice underlined the role of altered CFTR expression for these functional changes, and work in conditional Hif1a mutant mice verified HIF-1-dependent CFTR regulation in vivo. In summary, our study clarifies CFTR regulation and introduces the concept of a HIF-1-orchestrated response designed to regulate ion and fluid movement across hypoxic intestinal epithelia."

Our data show that alpha-defensin human neutrophil protein 1 (HNP1) and human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) inhibit BKV infection by targeting an early event in the viral lifecycle. HD5 treatment of BKV reduced viral attachment to cells, whereas cellular treatment with HD5 did not. Colocalization studies indicated that HD5 interacts directly with BKV. Ultrastructural analysis revealed HD5-induced aggregation of virions. HD5 also inhibited infection of cells by other related polyomaviruses. This is the first study to demonstrate polyomavirus sensitivity to defensins. We also show a novel mechanism whereby HD5 binds to BKV leading to aggregation of virion particles preventing normal virus binding to the cell surface and uptake into cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017092074,"Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) binds and inhibits activation of the critical muscle transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2). However, the physiological significance of the HDAC4-MEF2 complex in skeletal muscle has not been established. Here we show that in skeletal muscle, HDAC4 is a critical modulator of MEF2-dependent structural and contractile gene expression in response to neural activity. We present evidence that loss of neural input leads to concomitant nuclear accumulation of HDAC4 and transcriptional reduction of MEF2-regulated gene expression. Cell-based assays show that HDAC4 represses structural gene expression via direct binding to AT-rich MEF2 response elements. Notably, using both surgical denervation and the neuromuscular disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model, we found that elevated levels of HDAC4 are required for efficient repression of MEF2-dependent structural gene expression, indicating a link between the pathological induction of HDAC4 and subsequent MEF2 target gene suppression. Supporting this supposition, we show that ectopic expression of HDAC4 in muscle fibers is sufficient to induce muscle damage in mice. Our study identifies HDAC4 as an activity-dependent regulator of MEF2 function and suggests that activation of HDAC4 in response to chronically reduced neural activity suppresses MEF2-dependent gene expression and contributes to progressive muscle dysfunction observed in neuromuscular diseases."

Syntrophins play critical roles in regulating the apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux (and thus in lipid homeostasis) by suppressing protein degradation in brain (14Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S.

Because cholesterol is an essential component of cells, however, excessive elimination of cholesterol could result in cell death. Consequently, the ability to rapidly degrade ABCA1, to prevent cholesterol efflux, is also important. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for additional proteins associated with the C-terminal region of ABCA1. The screen identified a nuclear receptor, LXRβ, as a candidate that associates with the C-terminal 120 amino acids of human ABCA1. In WI-38 and THP-1 cells, endogenous LXRβ interacts with ABCA1 under conditions in which cholesterol does not accumulate, i.e. when cholesterol is not in excess. LXRβ suppresses ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and thereby blocks HDL formation. This study is the first to show that protein-protein interaction suppresses the function of ABCA1 and that LXRβ is involved not only in the transcriptional regulation but also in the post-translational regulation of ABCA1. Plasmids—cDNAs encoding human LXRα (NCBI Database accession number NM_005693) and human LXRβ (accession number NM_007121) were inserted into the p401 vector or pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—The linker region (amino acids 1134–1345) of human ABCA1 was fused with glutathione S-transferase, and the fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. The fusion protein was purified and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Anti-LXRα (PP-K8607-00), anti-LXRβ (PP-K8917-00), and anti-retinoid X receptor (RXR; PP-K8508-00) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Perseus Proteomics. Cell Culture and Transfection—THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Differentiation into macrophages was achieved by exposing cells to 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 72 h. Macrophages were incubated in the presence of 5 μm retinoic acid for 24 h to induce the expression of ABCA1. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells in 100-mm culture dishes were transfected with 8 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane Preparation and Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were cultured on 100-mm dishes and transiently transfected with 6 μg of ABCA1 and 2 μg of LXRα or LXRβ. Cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation in isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) containing protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml p-amidinophenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After the nucleus was removed by centrifugation (2800 × g), membranes were prepared by centrifugation (20,000 × g) and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins from the membrane lysate (300 μg) were incubated with 2.5 μg of anti-LXRα, anti-LXRβ, or rabbit anti-ABCA1 polyclonal antibody (described above) at 4 °C for 60 min. The protein complexes containing each antibody were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma). ABCA1 and vinculin were detected with anti-ABCA1 antibody KM3110 (14Munehira Y. Ohnishi T.

Western blots were analyzed using a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imaging system. Biotinylation of Cell-surface Proteins—HEK293 cells were cotransfected with ABCA1 and LXRs. At 28 h after transfection, cells were biotinylated as reported previously (17Kaneko E. Matsuda M. Yamada Y. Tachibana Y. Shimomura I. Makishima M. J. Biol.

Cellular Lipid Release Assay—HEK293 cells were subcultured in 6-cm dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 18 h of incubation, cells were transfected with ABCA1 and FLAG-tagged LXRs using Lipofectamine. Cells were washed 28 h after transfection with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and 10 μg/ml apoA-I with or without 100 nm TO901317 for 2 h at 37 °C. The lipid content of the medium was determined as described previously (19Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S.

THP-1 cells were subcultured in 10-cm dishes at a density of 1 × 107 cells in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and prepared as described above.

Immunostaining—Immunostaining was performed as described previously (19Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S.

Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractions—Cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 and protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 15 min. The nucleus was precipitated by centrifugation (2800 × g), and the supernatant were collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was disrupted in the presence of 1% SDS using a sonicator. RNA Interference—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for LXRα (siNR1H3, GAGGCUGCAGCACACAUAUGUGGAA (sense)), LXRβ (siNR1H3, GCUACAACCACGAGACAGAGUGUAU (sense)), and a scrambled control were obtained from Invitrogen. WI-38 cells were transfected for 72 h with 120 nm siRNAs using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). RNA Extraction and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cDNA was generated using random primers (Applied Biosystems) and a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) in the presence of an RNase inhibitor. Each RNA sample was amplified in triplicate with primers for ABCA1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as a housekeeping marker, on a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). The probes used were as follows: human ABCA1, 5′-ACCCAATCCCAGACACGCCCTGCCA-3′; and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TTGGGCGCCTGGTCACCAGGGCTGC-3′. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of differences between mean values was analyzed using the unpaired t test. Multiple comparisons were performed using Dunnett's test following analysis of variance. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Unless indicated otherwise, results are given as means ± S.E. (n = 3). ABCA1 Interacts with Nuclear LXRα and LXRβ—Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we searched for proteins that are associated with the C-terminal 120 amino acids of human ABCA1. We identified a nuclear receptor, LXRβ, as a candidate and then examined the interaction between ABCA1 and LXRs by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). ABCA1 and LXRα or LXRβ were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, and a membrane fraction was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions, LXRα or LXRβ was detected in the lysate of the membrane fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 5). When either LXRα or LXRβ was precipitated with an appropriate antibody, ABCA1 was co-precipitated (lanes 3 and 7). Conversely, LXRs were also co-precipitated with ABCA1 when we used an antibody against ABCA1 (data not shown). The addition of an LXR agonist, TO901317, to the lysate impaired the co-precipitation of ABCA1 with LXRs by the anti-LXR antibodies, although the immunoprecipitation of LXRs themselves was not affected (lanes 4 and 8), suggesting that conformational changes caused by agonists impair the interaction. To confirm that this interaction is direct, the C-terminal 298 amino acids of ABCA1 fused with maltose-binding protein and LXRα or LXRβ fused with glutathione S-transferase were purified from E. coli. The maltose-binding protein-fused C-terminal 298 amino acids of ABCA1 were pulled down by glutathione S-transferase-fused LXRs (supplemental Fig. 1). Because the addition of TO901317 to the lysate impaired the co-precipitation, it was not likely that the co-precipitation was due merely to the aggregation of these proteins. However, it was still possible that the localization of LXR in the membrane fraction and the co-precipitation were due to the overexpression of these proteins in the heterologous expression system. Interaction of Endogenous LXRs with ABCA1 in WI-38 Cells—Therefore, we next examined whether the endogenously expressed LXRs interact with ABCA1. WI-38 human lung fibroblasts were incubated with retinoic acid for 24 h to induce the expression of ABCA1 and LXRs. LXRα and LXRβ were detected in the lysate of the membrane fraction of WI-38 cells (Fig. 2, a and b, lane 1). When LXRα or LXRβ was precipitated with a suitable antibody, ABCA1 was co-precipitated (lane 5). Following knockdown of each LXR with siRNA, the corresponding band (LXRα or LXRβ) disappeared from the lysate (lanes 2 and 3), as did the band corresponding to co-precipitated ABCA1 (lanes 6 and 7). Both LXRα and LXRβ co-precipitated with ABCA1 by the antibody against ABCA1 (Fig. 2, c and d, lane 5). Neither LXRα nor LXRβ was co-precipitated when they were knocked down with siRNA (lanes 6 and 7). These results suggest that the antibodies used in this study against LXRα and LXRβ indeed react with endogenous LXRα and LXRβ, respectively, and that endogenous LXRα and LXRβ interact with ABCA1. The expression of ABCA1 was greatly reduced when LXRβ was knocked down with siRNA (Fig. 2, a–d, lane 3), but not when LXRα was knocked down (lane 2). These results suggest that LXRβ plays a major role in the expression of ABCA1 in WI-38 fibroblasts under these conditions. This is consistent with the report that the expression of LXRβ does not change during cholesterol accumulation and that LXRβ plays a role in resting macrophages, whereas LXRα plays a prominent role in macrophages in the context of cellular cholesterol loading (20Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Goodwin B. Galardi C.M. Maglich J.M. Wilson J.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

Interaction of LXRβ with ABCA1 in THP-1 Cells—To confirm further that endogenous LXRs interact with ABCA1, THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells were induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells by treatment with phorbol ester, and a membrane fraction was prepared. Because LXR agonists cause the dissociation of LXRs from ABCA1 (Fig. 1), THP-1 cells were not incubated with LXR agonists but with a minimum dose (10 nm) of retinoic acid. Under these conditions, LXRβ was detected in the lysate of the membrane fraction (Fig. 3, a and b, lane 1), but LXRα was not (data not shown). When ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated, LXRβ was co-precipitated (Fig. 3a, lane 3) and vice versa (Fig. 3b, lane 3). RXR was also co-precipitated with ABCA1 and LXRβ (Fig. 3, a and b, lane 3). The co-precipitation of LXRβ and RXR with ABCA1 was impaired when an LXR agonist, TO901317 (lane 4) or 25-hydroxycholesterol (lane 5), was added to the lysate; in contrast, the addition of an RXR agonist, retinoic acid, did not affect the co-precipitation (lane 6). These results suggest that LXRβ/RXR interacts with ABCA1 in THP-1 cells under conditions in which cholesterol does not accumulate in the cells and that the heterodimer dissociates from ABCA1 when LXR agonists accumulate. Subcellular Localization of LXRβ in THP-1 Cells—LXRs are thought to be located in the nucleus even in the absence of agonists. We analyzed the subcellular distribution of LXRβ in THP-1 cells in the absence of exogenously added agonists (Fig. 4, a and b). Cells were lysed with 1% Tween 20 and fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under the experimental conditions, ∼40% of LXRβ was recovered in the cytosolic fraction, although no c-Myc protein was detected in this fraction. When TO901317 was added to the cells, only ∼20% of LXRβ was recovered from the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4, a and b). Next, the subcellular distribution of LXRβ in THP-1 cells was observed under an immunofluorescence microscope. In the absence of added agonists, a significant amount of LXRβ was observed outside of the nucleus (Fig. 4c). When TO901317 was added, most of the LXRβ translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 4d). When LXRβ was knocked down by siRNA, no signal for LXRβ was observed, confirming the specificity of the antibody (supplemental Fig. 2). These results strongly suggest that a significant amount of LXRβ exists outside of the nucleus under conditions in which cholesterol does not accumulate in the cell but that the protein translocates into the nucleus when LXR ligands accumulate. Because LXRα is abundantly expressed in tissues important for cholesterol homeostasis, such as liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and macrophages, and because LXRα plays a major role in reverse cholesterol transport from cholesterol-loaded cells, the dynamics of LXRβ cytosolic localization might have been overlooked in previous studies. LXRβ Modulates Turnover of ABCA1 and Increases Surface Expression—While investigating the consequence of ABCA1-LXRβ interaction, we noticed that the amount of ABCA1 was significantly increased when it was coexpressed with LXRβ (data not shown). We expected the interaction with LXRβ to retard the degradation of ABCA1. We measured the half-life of ABCA1, obtaining a value 1.5–2 h (Fig. 5, a–d), consistent with previous reports (13Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 15091-15095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), when ABCA1 was expressed alone in HEK293 cells. When ABCA1 was coexpressed with LXRβ (Fig. 5, a and b), however, its degradation was retarded, and its half-life became longer than 5 h as α1-syntrophin was coexpressed. When TO901317, which causes dissociation of the ABCA1-LXRβ/RXR complex, was added, the coexpression of LXRβ did not retard the degradation of ABCA1, whereas the coexpression of α1-syntrophin still did (Fig. 5, c and d). Next, we examined the surface expression of ABCA1 by conducting biotinylation experiments (Fig. 5e). When ABCA1 was transiently coexpressed with LXRβ in HEK293 cells, the amount of ABCA1 in the lysate increased, and 51 ± 7.0% of ABCA1 was precipitated with avidin-agarose compared with 33 ± 3.4% when expressed alone. These results suggest that interaction with LXRβ not only retards the degradation of ABCA1 but also increases the surface expression of ABCA1. Interaction with LXRβ Suppresses ABCA1-mediated Cholesterol Efflux—To analyze the functional consequences of the formation of ABCA1-LXRβ/RXR, apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux was examined in HEK293 cells transiently cotransfected with ABCA1 and LXRβ (Fig. 6a, open bars). ApoA-I-dependent efflux was reduced with increasing amounts of transfected LXRβ DNA and with increased expression of LXRβ, even though the amount of ABCA1 was increased compared with that without cotransfection with LXRβ (Fig. 6, a and b). With the addition of TO901317, which impairs ABCA1-LXR interaction, apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux was greatly enhanced (>100%) when LXRβ was cotransfected (Fig. 6a, filled bars). TO901317 neither induced endogenous ABCA1 expression (data not shown) nor affected apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux when LXRβ was not cotransfected (Fig. 6a). Western blot analysis of ABCA1 after the efflux experiment showed that, when LXRβ (5 μg) was cotransfected, treatment with TO901317 for 2 h reduced the amount of ABCA1 to the level obtained without LXR expression (Fig. 6b). ABCA1-LXR Interaction Modulates ApoA-I-dependent Cholesterol Efflux from THP-1 Cells—The above results suggested that ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux might be suppressed by the interaction with the LXRβ/RXR heterodimer when cholesterol does not accumulate in cells. Therefore, we carefully analyzed the apoA-I-dependent efflux of cholesterol from THP-1 cells. When differentiated THP-1 cells were incubated with a minimum dose (10 nm) of retinoic acid, no apoA-I-dependent efflux was detected (Fig. 7a), although a significant amount of ABCA1 was expressed (Fig. 7b). However, when 100 nm TO901317 was added to the medium for 2 h, apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux was clearly observed. Under these conditions, no increase in ABCA1 mRNA (Fig. 7c) or ABCA1 protein (Fig. 7b) was observed. Even after a 4-h incubation with TO901317, only a slight increase in ABCA1 mRNA and protein (1.34 ± 0.13-fold and 1.05 ± 0.04-fold, respectively) was observed. After a 6-h incubation, mRNA and protein were markedly increased (2.33 ± 0.21-fold and 1.72 ± 0.04-fold, respectively) (data not shown). When cholesterol accumulates in cells, intracellular concentrations of oxysterols increase, and LXR, activated via the binding of oxysterols, stimulates the gene expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and other proteins that remove cholesterol from cells. The synthesized ABCA1 protein is distributed on the plasma membrane as well as in intracellular compartments and turns over rapidly with a half-life of 1–2 h (11Wang Y. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5692-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, after excess cholesterol is eliminated, ABCA1 would be degraded rapidly, and cells would have little ABCA1 on the plasma membrane. Because the transcription, splicing, translation, and maturation of ABCA1, at >2000 amino acid residues, takes several hours after transcriptional activation, cells would not be able to cope with an acute accumulation of cholesterol for several hours before the vigorous transcriptional activation of ABCA1 via the LXRα autoregulatory loop. We propose a novel regulatory mechanism of ABCA1 based on the results presented in this study as follows (Fig. 8). (i) When the intracellular concentration of oxysterols is low, the LXRβ/RXR complex binds to ABCA1, and the ABCA1-LXRβ/RXR complex distributes on the plasma membrane but is inert in terms of cholesterol efflux, which prevents the excessive elimination of cholesterol from cells. (ii) When cholesterol accumulates and the intracellular concentration of oxysterols increases, oxysterols bind to LXRβ, and the LXRβ/RXR complex dissociates from ABCA1. (iii) Once free from LXRβ/RXR, ABCA1 is now active in the formation of HDL and decreases the local cholesterol concentration immediately. (iv) Upon binding oxysterols in the cytosol, LXRβ/RXR is translocated to the nucleus and activates the transcription of ABCA1 and other genes. Consequently, LXRβ can exert an immediate post-translational response, as well as a rather slow transcriptional response, to changes in cellular cholesterol accumulation to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. This novel mechanism would be important for macrophages because macrophages must cope with rapid increases in intracellular cholesterol when they phagocytose apoptotic cells. α1-Syntrophin (14Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S. Furuya A. Shitara K. Imamura M. Yokota T. Takeda S. Amachi T. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol.

Both proteins interact directly with ABCA1 via the C-terminal three amino acids SYV (a PDZ (PSD95-Discs large-ZO1) protein-binding motif). These interactions retard the degradation of ABCA1, increase the surface expression of ABCA1, and consequently increase the apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol (14Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S. Furuya A. Shitara K. Imamura M. Yokota T. Takeda S. Amachi T. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15091-15095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of ABCA1 degradation and of its retardation by syntrophins have not yet been clarified. Interaction with LXRβ also retards the degradation of ABCA1 and increases the surface expression of ABCA1. In contrast to the interaction with syntrophins, this interaction suppresses the formation of HDL; hence, the mechanism of the LXRβ interaction is likely different from that of the syntrophin interaction. We found that the site of interaction of ABCA1 with LXRβ is different from that with syntrophins. The replacement of Leu2247 of ABCA1 with alanine abolished the co-precipitation with LXRβ (supplemental Fig. 3a). The coexpression of LXRβ did not retard the degradation of ABCA1(L2247A), whereas the coexpression of α1-syntrophin retarded the degradation of ABCA1(L2247A) (supplemental Fig. 3, b and c). These results suggest that the amino acid substitution L2247A does not alter total protein conformation but rather specifically affects the interaction with LXRβ. ABCA1(L2247A) showed significant apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux, and the addition of TO901317 did not affect it even when LXRβ was coexpressed (supplemental Fig. 3d). Leu2247 is in a sequence (2247LTSFL2251) that resembles the sequences (ϕXXϕϕ) (22Metivier R. Stark A. Flouriot G. Hubner M.R. Brand H. Penot G. Manu D. Denger S. Reid G. Kos M. Russell R.B. Kah O. Pakdel F. Gannon F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) of co-activators and co-repressors interacting with nuclear receptors. Therefore, we speculate that the co-activator/co-repressor interaction site of LXRβ could be involved in the interaction with ABCA1. These results suggest that LXRβ regulates the efflux of cholesterol not only by modulating ABCA1 gene expression as nuclear receptors but also by directly modulating the efflux activity of ABCA1. This study is the first to show that protein-protein interaction suppresses ABCA1 function. This is also the first example of mutual regulation between a nuclear receptor and a membrane protein that is also an end product of transcriptional regulation by the same nuclear receptor. This unusual situation possibly came about through the co-evolution of these proteins, resulting in a sophisticated network devoted to the maintenance of homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2053521290,"Autosomal dominant (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive (ARPKD) polycystic kidney disease are caused by mutations in Pkd1/Pkd2 and Pkhd1, which encode polycystins (PCs) and fibrocystin/polyductin (FPC). Our recent study reported that a deficiency in FPC increases the severity of cystic disease in Pkd2 mutants and down-regulates PC2 in vivo, but the precise molecular mechanism of these effects is unknown (Kim, I., Fu, Y., Hui, K., Moeckel, G., Mai, W., Li, C., Liang, D., Zhao, P., Ma, J., Chen, X.-Z., George, A. L., Jr., Coffey, R. J., Feng, Z. P., and Wu, G. (2008) J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 19, 455-468). In this study, through the use of deletion and mutagenesis strategies, we identified a PC2-binding domain in the intracellular C terminus of FPC and an FPC-binding domain in the intracellular N terminus of PC2. These binding domains provide a molecular basis for the physical interaction between PC2 and FPC. In addition, we also found that physical interaction between the binding domains of PC2 and FPC is able to prevent down-regulation of PC2 induced by loss of FPC. In vivo, we generated a mouse model of ADPKD with hypomorphic Pkd2 alleles (Pkd2nf3/nf3) and show that PC2 down-regulation is accompanied by a phenotype similar to that of Pkhd1(-/-) mice. These findings demonstrate a common mechanism underlying cystogenesis in ADPKD and ARPKD and provide insight into the molecular relationship between PC2 and FPC."
https://openalex.org/W2079574531,"In the present study we determined the performance interrelations of ten different tasks that involved the processing of temporal intervals in the subsecond range, using multidimensional analyses. Twenty human subjects executed the following explicit timing tasks: interval categorization and discrimination (perceptual tasks), and single and multiple interval tapping (production tasks). In addition, the subjects performed a continuous circle-drawing task that has been considered an implicit timing paradigm, since time is an emergent property of the produced spatial trajectory. All tasks could be also classified as single or multiple interval paradigms. Auditory or visual markers were used to define the intervals. Performance variability, a measure that reflects the temporal and non-temporal processes for each task, was used to construct a dissimilarity matrix that quantifies the distances between pairs of tasks. Hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling were carried out on the dissimilarity matrix, and the results showed a prominent segregation of explicit and implicit timing tasks, and a clear grouping between single and multiple interval paradigms. In contrast, other variables such as the marker modality were not as crucial to explain the performance between tasks. Thus, using this methodology we revealed a probable functional arrangement of neural systems engaged during different timing behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2138613983,"Neutrophils are key players of innate immunity and influence inflammatory and immune reactions through the production of numerous cytokines. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is known to stimulate several neutrophil responses, and recent evidence suggests that neutrophils might represent a source of IL-18. Here, we show that neutrophils constitutively produce both IL-18 and its antagonist, IL-18BP. Cell activation does not affect IL-18BP release but leads to an increased gene expression and secretion of IL-18, a process that depends on NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, endogenous IL-18 feeds back on the neutrophils to augment cytokine generation in lipopolysaccharide-treated cells. Accordingly, exogenous IL-18 can induce the gene expression and release of several inflammatory cytokines in neutrophils, including its own expression. We finally report that IL-18 activates the p38 MAPK, MEK/ERK, and PI3K/Akt pathways in neutrophils. The IKK cascade is also activated by IL-18, resulting in IkappaB-alpha degradation, NF-kappaB activation, and RelA phosphorylation. Accordingly, these pathways contribute to the generation of inflammatory cytokines in IL-18-stimulated neutrophils. By contrast, the phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of various STAT proteins were not induced by IL-18. Collectively, our results unveil new interactions between IL-18 and neutrophils and further support a role for these cells in influencing both innate and adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2066447432,"Adipocyte function is crucial for the control of whole body energy homeostasis. Pathway analysis of differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes reveals that major metabolic pathways induced during differentiation involve mitochondrial function. However, it is not clear why differentiated white adipocytes require enhanced respiratory chain activity relative to pre-adipocytes. To address this question, we used small interference RNA to interfere with the induction of the transcription factor Tfam, which is highly induced between days 2 and 4 of differentiation and is crucial for replication of mitochondrial DNA. Interference with Tfam resulted in cells with decreased respiratory chain capacity, reflected by decreased basal oxygen consumption, and decreased mitochondrial ATP synthesis, but no difference in many other adipocyte functions or expression levels of adipose-specific genes. However, insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface and subsequent glucose transport are impaired in Tfam knockdown cells. Paradoxically, insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation is significantly enhanced in these cells. These studies reveal independent links between mitochondrial function, insulin signaling, and glucose transport, in which impaired respiratory chain activity enhances insulin signaling to Akt phosphorylation, but impairs GLUT4 translocation. These results indicate that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in adipocytes can cause impaired insulin responsiveness of GLUT4 translocation by a mechanism downstream of the Akt protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1994507245,"Mitochondrial precursor proteins are directed into the intermembrane space via two different routes, the presequence pathway and the redox-dependent MIA pathway. The pathways were assumed to be independent and transport different proteins. We report that the intermembrane space receptor Mia40 can switch between both pathways.

Human MIA40 and the C-terminal domain of yeast Mia40 (termed Mia40core) rescued the viability of Mia40-deficient yeast independently of the presence of a presequence.

Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and recognized by the TOM (translocase of outer membrane) complex. After translocation through TOM, precursor proteins destined for the matrix employ the presequence TIM23 complex (translocase of inner membrane) and the associated motor. The precursors carry N-terminal presequences that specifically interact with TOM and TIM23 subunits and are proteolytically removed upon arrival in the matrix (1Dolezal P. Likic V. Tachezy J.

(i) Precursors such as cytochrome b2 contain bipartite targeting information in their N-terminal region, a presequence-type matrix targeting signal followed by a hydrophobic sorting signal, which arrests translocation in the TIM23 complex.

For comparison, we also expressed the large form of Mia40 lacking the N-terminal targeting segments (17Milenkovic D. Gabriel K. Guiard B. Schulze-Specking A. Pfanner N. Chacinska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22472-22480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because disulfide-linked Mia40-precursor conjugates remain stable under nonreducing conditions (17Milenkovic D. Gabriel K. Guiard B. Schulze-Specking A. Pfanner N. Chacinska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22472-22480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Sideris D.P. Tokatlidis K. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1360-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we used nonreducing SDS-PAGE to directly monitor the binding of precursor proteins to the purified Mia40 constructs. Upon incubation with the 35S-labeled precursor of Tim9, both recombinant proteins formed Mia40-Tim9 conjugates with comparable efficiency (Fig. 1), indicating that Mia40core efficiently binds substrate proteins in vitro.To address whether Mia40core is functional in vivo, we attached the bipartite presequence of cytochrome b2 to its N terminus (b2-Mia40core) (Fig. 2A) and expressed it in yeast cells that lacked the chromosomal copy of MIA40 but expressed full-length Mia40 from a URA3-containing plasmid. Upon loss of the URA3-containing plasmid, the cells containing only b2-Mia40core were viable (Fig. 2B, right panel). The presequence of cytochrome b2 was also attached to the large form of Mia40 (b2-Mia40) (Fig. 2A) (13Naoé M. Ohwa Y. Ishikawa D. Ohshima C. Nishikawa S. Yamamoto H. Endo T. J. Biol.

The growth behavior of yeast cells expressing b2-Mia40core, b2-Mia40, or wild-type Mia40 was indistinguishable (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the C-terminal domain contains the essential part of Mia40.FIGURE 2The C-terminal half of Mia40 is functional.

Cytochrome b2 is first processed by the matrix processing peptidase and then by the inner membrane peptidase, leading to the mature form released to the IMS. The efficiency of the second cleavage depends on the presence of the heme-binding domain of mature cytochrome b2 (13Naoé M. Ohwa Y. Ishikawa D. Ohshima C. Nishikawa S. Yamamoto H. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47815-47821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As the b2 constructs contain only the presequence part, their processing was not complete, and two forms, intermediate and mature, were observed for b2-Mia40core (Fig. 2C), similar to the behavior of b2-Mia40 (13Naoé M.

The mature forms of b2-Mia40core and b2-Mia40 were released by swelling, like the soluble IMS protein cytochrome b2 (Fig. 2C).We performed several assays to determine whether mitochondria containing b2-Mia40core were functional in protein import to the IMS. The steady-state levels of IMS proteins, including the MIA substrate Tim10, were similar to those of mitochondria containing the large forms of Mia40 (Fig. 2, C and D). 35S-Labeled Tim9 was incubated with isolated mitochondria, and its import was assessed by protection against added proteinase K (12Chacinska A.

The formation of Mia40-Tim9 conjugates was monitored by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2F). The size difference of the Tim9 conjugates with intermediate Mia40core and mature Mia40core was sufficient for separation of the conjugates on the gel. Although the smaller mature b2-Mia40core was present in lower abundance than intermediate b2-Mia40core (Fig. 2C), it efficiently formed a conjugate with Tim9 (Fig. 2F), indicating that the soluble mature b2-Mia40core is functional. To test whether b2-Mia40core mitochondria promoted oxidation of the imported substrate proteins, we used a blue native assay developed for the precursor of Tim8, which allows a direct separation of reduced and oxidized forms (23Müller J.M. Milenkovic D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Chacinska A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). b2-Mia40core mitochondria generated oxidized Tim8 in a time-dependent manner with the same efficiency as mitochondria containing large Mia40 (Fig. 2G). Thus, Mia40core targeted to mitochondria by the presequence of cytochrome b2 fully replaced the essential function of wild-type Mia40.Presequence-free hMIA40 and Mia40core Complement Yeast—We systematically compared the primary structures of the available Mia40 homologs and constructed a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3A). Fungal Mia40 homologs are predicted to be larger than 25 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1), whereas metazoan and plant Mia40 homologs are typically small, in most cases below 20 kDa. Using three independent programs (Predotar (27Small I. Peeters N. Legeai F. Lurin C. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), MitoProt (28Claros M.G. Vincens P.

Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar)), the Mia40 homologs from fungi but not from metazoans or plants were predicted to carry mitochondrial presequences (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, fungal Mia40 proteins are large and possess N-terminal presequences (supplemental Fig. S1), whereas Mia40 proteins from higher eukaryotes usually correspond to the C-terminal half of fungal Mia40 and do not possess presequences. We asked whether hMIA40 (26Hofmann S. Rothbauer U. Mühlenbein N. Baiker K. Hell K. Bauer M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is able to substitute for yeast Mia40. We expressed hMIA40 in yeast, and by plasmid shuffling in a yeast strain with a chromosomal deletion of MIA40, we analyzed whether hMIA40 was able to substitute for the essential function of yeast Mia40. Fig. 3C shows that hMIA40 indeed rescued cell viability. Thus, the presequence-free human protein was able to complement yeast cells lacking endogenous Mia40.FIGURE 3Mia40 homologs.

The plasmid shuffling approach indeed revealed that presequence-free Mia40core fully rescued yeast viability (Fig. 4A). Mia40core was released upon swelling of mitochondria (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that it is a soluble IMS protein. We performed a systematic analysis to determine whether Mia40core mitochondria were functional: steady-state levels of IMS proteins (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5), import of 35S-labeled Tim9 to a protease-protected location (Fig. 4C), formation of Mia40core-precursor conjugates (Fig. 4D), and oxidation of imported Tim8 (Fig. 4E). In each case, Mia40core mitochondria showed a similar activity as mitochondria with wild-type Mia40. We concluded that the C-terminal half of yeast Mia40 can be targeted to mitochondria without a presequence and is functional, like full-length Mia40.FIGURE 4Mia40 without a presequence is functional.

This research investigated personal and environmental risk factors for child pedestrian RTIs relevant to an urban, developing world setting.This is a case control study of personal and environmental risk factors for child pedestrian RTIs in San Juan de Miraflores, Lima, Perú. The analysis of personal risk factors included 100 cases of serious pedestrian RTIs and 200 age and gender matched controls. Demographic, socioeconomic, and injury data were collected. The environmental risk factor study evaluated vehicle and pedestrian movement and infrastructure at the sites in which 40 of the above case RTIs occurred and 80 control sites.After adjustment, factors associated with increased risk of child pedestrian RTIs included high vehicle volume (OR 7.88, 95%CI 1.97-31.52), absent lane demarcations (OR 6.59, 95% CI 1.65-26.26), high vehicle speed (OR 5.35, 95%CI 1.55-18.54), high street vendor density (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.01-1.55), and more children living in the home (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.00-1.56). Protective factors included more hours/day spent in school (OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.33-0.82) and years of family residence in the same home (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.95-0.99).Reducing traffic volumes and speeds, limiting the number of street vendors on a given stretch of road, and improving lane demarcation should be evaluated as components of child pedestrian RTI interventions in poorer countries."
https://openalex.org/W2059109598,"In osteoarthritis (OA) articular chondrocytes undergo phenotypic changes culminating in the progressive loss of cartilage from the joint surface. The molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. Here we report enhanced (approximately 7-fold) expression of F-spondin, a neuronal extracellular matrix glycoprotein, in human OA cartilage (P<0.005). OA-specific up-regulation of F-spondin was also demonstrated in rat knee cartilage following surgical menisectomy. F-spondin treatment of OA cartilage explants caused a 2-fold increase in levels of the active form of TGF-beta1 (P<0.01) and a 10-fold induction of PGE2 (P<0.005) in culture supernatants. PGE2 induction was found to be dependent on TGF-beta and the thrombospondin domain of the F-spondin molecule. F-spondin addition to cartilage explant cultures also caused a 4-fold increase in collagen degradation (P<0.05) and a modest reduction in proteoglycan synthesis (approximately 20%; P<0.05), which were both TGF-beta and PGE2 dependent. F-spondin treatment also led to increased secretion and activation of MMP-13 (P<0.05). Together these studies identify F-spondin as a novel protein in OA cartilage, where it may act in situ at lesional areas to activate latent TGF-beta and induce cartilage degradation via pathways that involve production of PGE2."

This study was performed to gain current data regarding drug treatment of schizophrenia as practiced in the community and to assess the frequencies of off-label drug class combinations. 200 DSM IV-diagnosed schizophrenic patients recruited from community treatment sources participated in this cross-sectional study of community based schizophrenic patients. Drug class categories include First and Second Generation Antipsychotic drugs (FGA and SGA, respectively), mood stabilizers, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs. 25.5% of patients received antipsychotic monotherapy; 70% of patients received an antipsychotic and another drug class. A total of 42.5% of patients received more than one antipsychotic drug. The most common drug class combination was antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. Stepwise linear discriminant function analysis identified the diagnosis of schizoaffective schizophrenia, history of having physically hurt someone and high scores on the General Portion of the PANSS rating scale predicted the combined use of an antipsychotic drug and a mood stabilizer. ""Real world"" pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia has developed its own established practice that is predominantly off-label and may have outstripped current data support.

https://openalex.org/W2031185328,"Background This paper presents data on alternations in the argument structure of common domain-specific verbs and their associated verbal nominalizations in the PennBioIE corpus. Alternation is the term in theoretical linguistics for variations in the surface syntactic form of verbs, e.g. the different forms of stimulate in FSH stimulates follicular development and follicular development is stimulated by FSH. The data is used to assess the implications of alternations for biomedical text mining systems and to test the fit of the sublanguage model to biomedical texts. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined 1,872 tokens of the ten most common domain-specific verbs or their zero-related nouns in the PennBioIE corpus and labelled them for the presence or absence of three alternations. We then annotated the arguments of 746 tokens of the nominalizations related to these verbs and counted alternations related to the presence or absence of arguments and to the syntactic position of non-absent arguments. We found that alternations are quite common both for verbs and for nominalizations. We also found a previously undescribed alternation involving an adjectival present participle. Conclusions/Significance We found that even in this semantically restricted domain, alternations are quite common, and alternations involving nominalizations are exceptionally diverse. Nonetheless, the sublanguage model applies to biomedical language. We also report on a previously undescribed alternation involving an adjectival present participle."

We report here the identification of a gene encoding aldonolactonase, which catalyzes a penultimate step of the biosynthesis of AsA in Euglena. By a BLAST search, we identified one candidate for the enzyme having significant sequence identity with rat gluconolactonase, a key enzyme for the production of AsA via d-glucuronate in animals. The purified recombinant aldonolactonase expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the reversible reaction of l-galactonate and l-galactono-1,4-lactone with zinc ion as a cofactor. The apparent Km values for l-galactonate and l-galactono-1,4-lactone were 1.55 ± 0.3 and 1.67 ± 0.39 mm, respectively.

Van Montagu M. Inze D. Sanmartin M. Kanellis A. Smirnoff N. Benzie I.J.J. Strain J.J. Favell D. Fletcher J. J. Sci. Food Agric. 2000; 80: 825-860Crossref Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). AsA has a pivotal role both as an antioxidant and as an enzyme cofactor in animals. In plants, AsA has been documented to play multiple roles in the control of photosynthesis, cell expansion and growth, and transmembrane electron transport in addition to its well characterized role as an antioxidant (3Smirnoff N. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 229-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ishikawa T. Dowdle J. Smirnoff N. Physiol. Plant. 2006; 126: 343-355Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). With regard to the biosynthesis of AsA in living organisms, the major pathways differ between animals and plants. In animals, the committed step in the biosynthesis utilizes d-glucuronate (d-GlcUA), l-gulonate (l-GulA), and l-gulono-1,4-lactone (l-GulL) as a direct precursor of AsA (5Nishikimi M. Yagi K. Subcell. Biochem. 1996; 25: 17-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This pathway is a branch of the d-GlcUA pathway via the pentose phosphate pathway. A microsome-localized enzyme, l-GulL oxidase, catalyzes the terminal step to produce AsA. Genetic evidence that l-GulL is synthesized directly from l-GulA, not mediated by d-glucuronolactone, has been provided by the identification of SMP30 in rats as gluconolactonase (6Kondo Y. Inai Y. Sato Y. Handa S. Kubo S. Shimokado K. Goto S. Nishikimi M. Maruyama N. Ishigami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast to animals, plants utilize l-galactono-1,4-lactone (l-GalL) as the terminal precursor for the biosynthesis of AsA, which is produced from l-galactose via GDP-d-mannose and GDP-l-galactose as the intermediates (Man/Gal pathway) (4Ishikawa T. Dowdle J. Smirnoff N. Physiol. Plant. 2006; 126: 343-355Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Smirnoff N. Conklin P.L. Loewus F.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The l-GalL is finally oxidized by the action of l-GalL dehydrogenase located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, resulting in the production of AsA (9Bartoli C.G. Pastori G.M. Foyer C.H.

Recently, an overall picture of the pathway was completed with the identification and analysis of a causal gene in low-AsA vtc mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana (11Conklin P.L. Norris S.R. Wheeler G.L.

Genetic evidence indicates that the Man/Gal pathway is of critical importance. A null Arabidopsis mutant of the CYT1 gene, which encodes the same protein as VTC1 (GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase, an enzyme required for production of GDP-Man from Man 1-P), showed lethality in seedlings as well as caused reduced AsA levels (13Lukowitz W. Nickle T.C. Meinke D.W. Last R.L. Conklin P.L. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Dowdle et al. (14Dowdle J. Ishikawa T. Gatzek S. Rolinski S. Smirnoff N. Plant J. 2007; 52: 673-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) also reported that VTC2 encodes a GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase enzyme that breaks down GDP-l-Gal phosphorolytically, producing l-Gal 1-P, and the knock-out mutant of two VTC2 genes shows growth arrest immediately upon germination and the cotyledons subsequently bleach. These findings indicated that the Man/Gal pathway is the only physiologically significant source of AsA in Arabidopsis plants. Although the Man/Gal pathway appears to be the predominant pathway, several other possible biosynthetic pathways have been proposed via uronic acid intermediates (15Agius F. Gonzalez-Lamothe R. Caballero J.L. Munoz-Blanco J. Botella M.A. Valpuesta V. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 16Lorence A. Chevone B.I. Mendes P. Nessler C.L. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The isolation of an aldo-keto reductase specific for d-galacturonate (d-GalUA) from ripening strawberry fruits and the generation of transgenic plants overexpressing its gene in Arabidopsis indicated the contribution of the alternative pathway via d-GalUA to the production of AsA (15Agius F. Gonzalez-Lamothe R. Caballero J.L. Munoz-Blanco J. Botella M.A. Valpuesta V. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In the pathway, although the conversion of l-galactonate (l-GalA), the product derived form the reduction of d-GalUA, to l-GalL is indispensable, aldonolactonase (ALase), a key catalyzing enzyme, is still missing. In addition to the pathway via d-GalUA, other possible pathways via d-GlcUA or l-gulose are also proposed, although most of the enzymes related to these pathways have not been identified yet. Therefore, it is still unclear how these pathways contribute to the biosynthesis of AsA in planta. In contrast to animals and plants, although some eukaryotic microorganisms also contain significant concentrations of cellular AsA, only scarce data are available on the way of biosynthesis. Chlorella and Prototheca contained appreciable amounts of AsA, and adding Man, l-GalA and l-GalL to the Prototheca medium resulted in significantly increased levels of AsA, suggesting the presence of a Man/Gal pathway similar to that in plants (17Running J.A. Severson D.K. Schneider K.J. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 29: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Running J.A. Burlingame R.P. Berry A. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 1841-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was recently identified that a protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, possesses a functional gene encoding d-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase that can also oxidize l-GalL, although the exact pathway arriving at the final precursor has not been clarified yet (19Wilkinson S.R. Prathalingam S.R. Taylor M.C. Horn D. Kelly J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11645-11650Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Euglena gracilis containing high concentrations of AsA, the biosynthetic pathway was first proposed by Shigeoka et al. (1Shigeoka S. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1979; 25: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Radioisotope tracer studies revealed that the biosynthesis of AsA in Euglena proceeded via the conversion of UDP-d-GlcUA to UDP-d-GalUA, with production of d-GalUA and reduction to l-GalA (Fig. 1). l-GalL was the final precursor in the production of AsA. These findings indicate that Euglena has developed a pathway analogous to the alternative pathway of AsA biosynthesis via d-GalUA, which is unclear in plants. Detection of l-GalL dehydrogenase activity in the Euglena cells (20Shigeoka S. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1979; 43: 2187-2188Google Scholar) and characterization of purified d-GalUA reductase (21Ishikawa T. Masumoto I. Iwasa N. Nishikawa H. Sawa Y. Shibata H. Nakamura A. Yabuta Y. Shigeoka S.

In this study, to understand the biosynthesis of AsA in Euglena in detail, we have identified and characterized ALase, catalyzing the penultimate step from l-GalA to l-GalL. We report that Euglena cells silenced of the expression of ALase by RNAi are unable to grow unless supplemented with l-GalL. Based on the present findings, we discuss the significance of AsA biosynthesis via d-GalUA/l-GalA and the physiological role of AsA in this organism. Materials—l-GalL, l-GulL, and d-GulL were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. d-GalL and d-glucono-δ-lactone were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan). l-GalA and l-GulA were prepared by the hydrolysis of l-GalL and l-GulL, respectively, under basic conditions (21Ishikawa T.

Twenty milliliters of 0.3 m NaOH was added to 100 μl of 10 mm l-GalL or l-GulL, the mixture was vigorously agitated by vortexing for 20 s, and 20 μl of 0.3 m hydrochloric acid was added to neutralize the solution. Strain and Culture—E. gracilis strain Z was grown in Koren-Hutner medium under continuous light at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 24 μmol m-2 s-1 at 26 °C for 6 days, by which time the stationary phase was reached (22Koren L.E.

Wallenfels K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 mm PIPES buffer, pH 6.5, 250 μm p-nitrophenol, 5 mm d-glucono-δ-lactone, 75 μm ZnCl2, and an enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. Decolorization of p-nitrophenol by acidification was monitored at 405 nm and quantified by titration with known amounts of HCl. Cloning of ALase cDNA and Expression of Recombinant Protein in Escherichia coli—Based on the Euglena EST data base from the Protest EST Program, a gene-specific primer was designed to amplify the missing 3′ end of the ALase EST (ELL00003818). The primer was 5′-TGACTGCCAGTCTGGGGACC-3′ and was used sequentially for 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) with a 5′/3′-RACE kit (Roche Applied Science). The complete sequence has been deposited with the DDBJ data bank under accession number AB306917. Then the full-length coding sequence of Euglena ALase was amplified by PCR with rALase-F (5′-CTCGAGATGCGAACGCTGGCCACCGTC-3′) and rALase-R (5′-AAGCTTACACGAGTTCAGCACAGCC-3′). The upstream and downstream primers contained XhoI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively. PCR amplification was carried out using Blend Taq (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The template was from a single-strand cDNA pool that was made from 6-day-old Euglena cells. The amplified product was cloned in the vector pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, MI), and the sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The XhoI/HindIII fragment was extracted and subcloned into the corresponding restriction site of the expression vector pCold TF (Takara, Shiga, Japan). E. coli cells (BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL, Stratagene) were transformed with the resulting constructs. The cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 34 μgml-1 chloramphenicol and 50 μgml-1 ampicillin at 37 °C. When the culture reached an absorbance at 0.4-0.5 at 600 nm, 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the cells were grown further at 15 °C for 20 h. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The Euglena ALase mutants, N116A, N161A, D219A, and S262A, were constructed using ALase cDNA as a template with a two-step PCR by KOD-Plus polymerase (Toyobo). The oligonucleotides used were: N116A-F 5′-GAAAGGTTCATACCGGAGCGCAGATGGAAAATGTG-3′, N116A-R 5′-CACATTTTCCATCTGCGCTCCGGTATGAACCTTTC-3′, N161A-F 5′-GTGTCACCATCGGAGCCGGTCTTGCCTGGAG-3′, N161A-R 5′-CTCCAGGCAAGACCGGCTCCGATGGTGACAC-3′, D219A-F 5′-GAGGCGGCCCCCGCTGGGATGACCATCGAC-3′, D219A-R 5′-GTCGATGGTCATCCCAGCGGGGGCCGCCTC-3′, S262A-F 5′-GCGAAGTACACGACCGCCGTGGCGCTCGGG-3′, and S262A-R 5′-CCCGAGCGCCACGGCGGTCGTGTACTTCGC-3′. Changed nucleotides are underlined. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resultant mutants were subcloned into the pCold TF expression vector (Takara) and then introduced into E. coli cells as described above. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed in a 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gel using a Tris/Gly buffer system. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. Purification of Recombinant Euglena ALase—All the procedures for the recombinant proteins were performed at 4 °C. E. coli cells were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.3 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole and lysed by sonication. The His-tagged recombinant ALase was purified on a column packed with TALON Metal Affinity resin (Clontech). The trigger factor with a His tag was removed from recombinant ALase by a 20-h digestion with HRV 3C protease (Takara) at 4 °C. To obtain the truncated recombinant ALase, the reaction mixture was applied to the TALON Metal Affinity resin column, and the flow-through protein was collected. The active fraction was stored at -20 °C after the addition of 20% (w/v) glycerol until used. RNAi Experiments—Silencing of ALase by RNAi was performed as described by Iseki et al. (24Iseki M. Matsunaga S. Murakami A. Ohno K. Shiga K. Yoshida K. Sugai M. Takahashi T. Hori T. Watanabe M. Nature. 2002; 415: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). An ∼450-bp length of partial ALase cDNA was PCR-amplified with the addition of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence at one end. The primer sequences were: EgALase RNAi-F 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAGCTGCAGCCAGAGCTTCCGAAAGG-3′ and EgALase RNAi-R 5′-GTTCCTTCTCCACCACACGGGGATATCACTCAGCATAAT-3′ (T7 RNA polymerase promoter sites are underlined). Then the sense and antisense RNAs were synthesized using the PCR products as templates (MEGAscript RNAi kit, Ambion). After purification of transcribed RNA with DNase I digestion followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was made by annealing equimolar amounts of the sense and antisense RNAs. Euglena cells of 2-day-old cultures were collected and resuspended in culture medium containing 4.2 mm Ca(NO3)2, 3.7 mm KH2PO4, and 2.1 mm MgSO4. Forty-five microliters of the cell suspension (∼1 × 106 cells) was transferred to a 0.4-cm-gap cuvette and electroporated with 5 μl of RNA solution (25 μg of ALase-dsRNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 1.2 kV and 25 microfarads. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the cell suspension was diluted with fresh Koren-Hutner medium (22Koren L.E. Hutner S.H. J. Protozool. 1967; 14: 17Google Scholar) or the medium supplemented with precursors related to AsA biosynthesis and cultured at 27 °C for restoration. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using RNAiso (Takara). The total RNA (10 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled ALase cDNA prepared by random priming. Measurement of AsA Concentration—Euglena cells were homogenized in 0.1 m HCl and 1 mm EDTA (∼0.1 g flesh weight ml-1) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Total AsA content was measured by iron(III) reduction (25Kampfenkel K. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—The significance of differences between data sets was evaluated by t test. Calculations were carried out with Microsoft Excel software. The Presence of a Homologue of the Rat Gluconolactonase Gene in Euglena Cells—Our previous identification and characterization of d-GalUA reductase from Euglena indicated that the occurrence of ALase is essential for the conversion of l-GalA, the resultant product of d-GalUA reduction, to l-GalL in this organism (21Ishikawa T. Masumoto I. Iwasa N. Nishikawa H. Sawa Y. Shibata H. Nakamura A. Yabuta Y. Shigeoka S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2006; 70: 2720-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, a BLASTp search was performed against the Euglena EST data base of the Protest EST Program using the amino acid sequence of the rat gluconolactonase involved in the biosynthesis of AsA in mammals (6Kondo Y. Inai Y. Sato Y. Handa S. Kubo S. Shimokado K. Goto S. Nishikimi M. Maruyama N. Ishigami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) as a query. An EST clone encoding the putative Euglena ALase had the cluster ID ELL00003818. The corresponding full-length cDNA was cloned by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method and submitted to the DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL data base (accession number AB306917). The predicted protein product, designated EgALase, displayed significant sequence identity (30.5%) and similarity (70.2%) with the rat gluconolactonase (Fig. 2). The EgALase Protein Has Lactonase Activity—To clarify the function of the EgALase isolated from the single-strand cDNA pool in 6-day-old Euglena cells, the recombinant EgALase was expressed in E. coli with the addition of N-terminal His tags followed by the trigger factor. The recombinant protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography and treated with HRV 3C protease to remove the additional tag proteins. The final product migrated in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼34 kDa (Fig. 3). The recombinant enzyme non-stereospecifically hydrolyzed aldonate lactones, such as d-glucono-δ-lactone, d-/l-GalL, and d-/l-GulL, indicating that the isolated cDNA encodes an aldonolactonase (Table 1). The enzyme required a divalent metal ion for maximum activity which was obtained by the addition of Zn2+ at a concentration of 75 μm (Fig. 4). Other divalent ions, Mn2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, had a significant low effect on the activity to 19, 9, 8, and 7%, respectively, of the enzyme activity given by the case of Zn2+. Therefore, Zn2+ was used at 75 μm for the subsequent experiments to study the catalytic properties of the Euglena lactonase.TABLE 1Comparison of substrate specificities of the recombinant Euglena ALase with the homologous enzyme from ratSubstrateSpecific activityrEgALaseSMP30aKondo et al.

The Km and Vmax values for d-glucono-δ-lactone were 2.08 ± 0.45 mm and 120 ± 22.7 μmol min-1 mg-1 protein, respectively, and the optimum pH was 6.5 (data not shown).

Although the Km values for l-GulL and l-GulA were two to three times higher than those for l-GalL and l-GalA, the Vmax values for them were approximately two times higher than those for l-GalL and l-GalA. These findings indicated the catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) of Euglena ALase for these substrates to be almost equal and that the reaction between uronic acid and lactone is reversible.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of purified recombinant ALaseALase/substrateKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmmmμmol min−1 mg−1 proteins−1s−1 mm−1rEgALasel-Galatono-γ-lactone1.67 ± 0.39333 ± 23.3450 ± 32270l-Galactonic acid1.55 ± 0.30455 ± 212615 ± 287397l-Gulono-γ-lactone3.05 ± 0.75769 ± 1401040 ± 189341l-Gulonic acid4.55 ± 0.231111 ± 2261503 ± 306330d-Glucono-σ-lactone2.08 ± 0.45120 ± 22.7160 ± 3177SMP30aKondo et al.

Open table in a new tab Various compounds listed in Table 3 were examined as to their effects on the ALase activity, with l-GalL and l-GalA as substrates. EDTA, a chelating reagent, at 1 mm strongly inhibited the activity in both directions. Reducing reagents, such as AsA and dithiothreitol, had no effect on the enzyme. On the other hand, the activity was inhibited by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl reagent. Interestingly, the activity toward l-GalL as a substrate was completely inhibited by 0.4 mm N-ethylmaleimide, whereas that toward l-GalA was only inhibited 47.5% at the same concentration compared with activity levels without N-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest that a Cys residue is involved in the recognition of substrates by the Euglena ALase. In contrast to the results for N-ethylmaleimide, 0.5 mm H2O2 caused a 27 and 32% activation with l-GalL and l-GalA as the substrate, respectively.TABLE 3Effect of various compounds on purified recombinant ALase from EuglenaCompoundConcentrationRelative activityl-GalAl-GalLmm%None100100EDTA11.20.0AsA194.798.8Dithiothreitol197.3105H2O20.11231180.5132127N-Ethylmaleimide0.452.50.04.033.30.0 Open table in a new tab Identification of Zn2+ Binding Residues in Euglena ALase—A homology model of the Euglena lactonase was generated using the molecular graphics package Molecular Operating Environment (Chemical Computing Group Inc., Montreal, Canada) on the basis of the crystal structure of Drp35, a Ca2+-dependent lactonase hydrolyzing aromatic lactones from Staphylococcus aureus (PDB codes 2DG1) as a template (26Tanaka, Y, Morikawa K. Ohki Y. Yao M. Tsumoto K. Watanabe N. Ohta T. Tanaka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5770-5780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Drp35 has a six-bladed β-propeller structure with two calcium ions. One calcium ion binds at the center of the β-propeller structure and is essential for the lactonase activity (26Tanaka, Y, Morikawa K. Ohki Y. Yao M. Tsumoto K. Watanabe N. Ohta T. Tanaka I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5770-5780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the primary structure of Euglena ALase had comparatively little homology (11% identity) with that of Staphylococcus Drp35 (Fig. 2), the calculated topology of Euglena ALase was quite similar to that of Drp35 (Fig. 5A). Comparison of the center of the β-propeller structure of Euglena ALase with that of Staphylococcus Drp35 suggests the presence of four residues coordinating with the zinc ion (Fig. 5B). Among them, Asn-116, Asn-161, and Asp-219 in Euglena ALase corresponded to Asp-138, Asn-185, and Asp-236, respectively, in Staphylococcus Drp35. Additionally, Ser-262 of Euglena ALase was estimated to be involved in coordinating with the zinc ion. To test the significance of the corresponding residues in Euglena ALase, these four residues were individually substituted with Ala, then the activity of each purified recombinant mutant was determined. As a result, none of mutants showed activity even at up to 150 μm concentrations of zinc ion (Fig. 6), indicating that these four residues, including the novel Ser-262, are essential for the ALase activity and participate in the binding of zinc ion.FIGURE 6Effect of amino acid substitution on Euglena ALase activity.

A dsRNA synthesized from part of the Euglena ALase sequence was introduced into Euglena cells by electroporation. Interestingly, the cells grew in medium supplemented with l-GalL (an intermediate that is downstream of ALase) 1 week after the introduction of the dsRNA (Fig. 7A). The AsA level in the dsRNA-containing cells after supplementation with l-GalL was 25 μmol of 10-9 cells. The cells did not grow in KH medium without any supplements at least within the study period. Northern analysis and an assay of ALase activity of the dsRNA-containing cells showed no significant detectable signal and activity of ALase, respectively, confirming the complete suppression of endogenous ALase by the introduction of dsRNA (Fig. 7B). These results clearly indicate that the expression of ALase is essential for the biosynthesis of AsA in Euglena, and AsA plays a pivotal role in cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W2105617555,"For the first time we have investigated the natural ecosystem engineering capacity of stromatolitic microbial assemblages. Stromatolites are laminated sedimentary structures formed by microbial activity and are considered to have dominated the shallows of the Precambrian oceans. Their fossilised remains are the most ancient unambiguous record of early life on earth. Stromatolites can therefore be considered as the first recognisable ecosystems on the planet. However, while many discussions have taken place over their structure and form, we have very little information on their functional ecology and how such assemblages persisted despite strong eternal forcing from wind and waves. The capture and binding of sediment is clearly a critical feature for the formation and persistence of stromatolite assemblages. Here, we investigated the ecosystem engineering capacity of stromatolitic microbial assemblages with respect to their ability to stabilise sediment using material from one of the few remaining living stromatolite systems (Highborne Cay, Bahamas). It was shown that the most effective assemblages could produce a rapid (12-24 h) and significant increase in sediment stability that continued in a linear fashion over the period of the experimentation (228 h). Importantly, it was also found that light was required for the assemblages to produce this stabilisation effect and that removal of assemblage into darkness could lead to a partial reversal of the stabilisation. This was attributed to the breakdown of extracellular polymeric substances under anaerobic conditions. These data were supported by microelectrode profiling of oxygen and calcium. The structure of the assemblages as they formed was visualised by low-temperature scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser microscopy. These results have implications for the understanding of early stromatolite development and highlight the potential importance of the evolution of photosynthesis in the mat forming process. The evolution of photosynthesis may have provided an important advance for the niche construction activity of microbial systems and the formation and persistence of the stromatolites which came to dominate shallow coastal environments for 80% of the biotic history of the earth."
https://openalex.org/W2057677719,"Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are potent mediators of inflammation synthesized by the concerted actions of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP), leukotriene C(4) synthase, and additional downstream enzymes, starting with arachidonic acid substrate. CysLTs produced by macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, and other inflammatory cells activate 3 different high-affinity CysLT receptors: CysLT(1)R, CysLT(2)R, and GPR 17. We sought to investigate vascular sites of CysLT(2)R expression and the role and mechanism of this receptor in mediating vascular permeability events. Vascular expression of CysLT(2)R was investigated by reporter gene expression in a novel CysLT(2)R deficient-LacZ mouse model. CysLT(2)R was expressed in small, but not large, vessels in mouse brain, bladder, skin, and cremaster muscle. Intravital, in addition to confocal and electron, microscopy investigations using FITC-labeled albumin in cremaster postcapillary venule preparations indicated rapid CysLT-mediated permeability, which was blocked by application of BAY-u9773, a dual CysLT(1)R/CysLT(2)R antagonist or by CysLT(2)R deficiency. Endothelial human CysLT(2)R overexpression in mice exacerbated vascular leakage even in the absence of exogenous ligand. The enhanced vascular permeability mediated by CysLT(2)R takes place via a transendothelial vesicle transport mechanism as opposed to a paracellular route and is controlled via Ca(2+) signaling. Our results reveal that CysLT(2)R can mediate inflammatory reactions in a vascular bed-specific manner by altering transendothelial vesicle transport-based vascular permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2052816780,"Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major public health concern since diagnosis is often delayed, increasing the risk of spread to the community and health care workers. Treatment is prolonged, and the total cost of treating a single case is high. Diagnosis has traditionally relied upon clinical suspicion, based on risk factors and culture with sensitivity testing, a process that can take weeks or months. Rapid diagnostic molecular techniques have the potential to shorten the time to commencing appropriate therapy, but have not been put to the test under field conditions.This retrospective case-control study aimed to identify risk factors for MDR-TB, and analyse the impact of testing for rifampicin resistance using RNA polymerase B (rpoB) mutations as a surrogate for MDR-TB. Forty two MDR-TB cases and 84 fully sensitive TB controls were matched by date of diagnosis; and factors including demographics, clinical presentation, microbiology findings, management and outcome were analysed using their medical records. Conventionally recognised risk factors for MDR-TB were absent in almost half (43%) of the cases, and 15% of cases were asymptomatic. A significant number of MDR-TB cases were identified in new entrants to the country. Using rpoB mutation testing, the time to diagnosis of MDR-TB was dramatically shortened by a median of 6 weeks, allowing patients to be commenced on appropriate therapy a median of 51days earlier than those diagnosed by conventional culture and sensitivity testing.MDR-TB is frequently an unexpected finding, may be asymptomatic, and is particularly prevalent among TB infected new entrants to the country. Molecular resistance testing of all acid fast bacilli positive specimens has the potential to rapidly identify MDR-TB patients and commence them on appropriate therapy significantly earlier than by conventional methods."
https://openalex.org/W2045257910,"Activated protein C (APC) plays a critical anticoagulant role in vivo by inactivating procoagulant factor Va and factor VIIIa and thus down-regulating thrombin generation. In addition, APC bound to the endothelial cell protein C receptor can initiate protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1)-mediated cytoprotective signaling. Protein S constitutes a critical cofactor for the anticoagulant function of APC but is not known to be involved in regulating APC-mediated protective PAR-1 signaling. In this study we utilized a site-directed mutagenesis strategy to characterize a putative protein S binding region within the APC Gla domain. Three single amino acid substitutions within the APC Gla domain (D35T, D36A, and A39V) were found to mildly impair protein S-dependent anticoagulant activity (<2-fold) but retained entirely normal cytoprotective activity. However, a single amino acid substitution (L38D) ablated the ability of protein S to function as a cofactor for this APC variant. Consequently, in assays of protein S-dependent factor Va proteolysis using purified proteins or in the plasma milieu, APC-L38D variant exhibited minimal residual anticoagulant activity compared with wild type APC. Despite the location of Leu-38 in the Gla domain, APC-L38D interacted normally with endothelial cell protein C receptor and retained its ability to trigger PAR-1 mediated cytoprotective signaling in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild type APC.

In vivo beneficial effects of APC have been reported in a number of different animal injury models. For example, APC demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects in rat and murine stroke models (14Domotor E. Benzakour O. Griffin J.H. Yule D. Fukudome K. Zlokovic B.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 4797-4801Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Cheng T. Liu D. Griffin J.H. Fernandez J.A. Castellino F. Rosen E.D. Fukudome K. Zlokovic B.V. Nat.

Lundgren D.H. Price J.V. Ousman S.S. Fernald G.H. Gerlitz B. Robinson W.H. Baranzini S.E. Grinnell B.W. Raine C.S. Sobel R.A. Han D.K. Steinman L. Nature. 2008; 451: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Furthermore, APC was protective in a murine model of diabetic nephropathy by inhibition of endothelial and podocyte apoptosis, whereas anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin had no such beneficial effect (18Isermann B. Vinnikov I.A. Madhusudhan T. Herzog S. Kashif M. Blautzik J. Corat M.A. Zeier M. Blessing E. Oh J. Gerlitz B. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.W. Chavakis T. Esmon C.T. Weiler H. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P.P. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Each of these animal studies demonstrated a consistent and critical role for the APC-EPCR-PAR-1 signaling axis. The therapeutic potential of APC was highlighted in the activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) study (19Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S. Garber G.E. Helterbrand J.D. Ely E.W. Fisher Jr., C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). Intravenous infusion of recombinant APC (24 μg/kg per h for 96 h) significantly reduced overall mortality (relative risk reduction, 19.4%) in adult patients with severe sepsis. In contrast, treatment with other anticoagulants (notably antithrombin (20Warren B.L. Eid A. Singer P. Pillay S.S. Carl P. Novak I. Chalupa P. Atherstone A. Penzes I. Kubler A. Knaub S. Keinecke H.O.

Assoc. 2003; 290: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar)) have no such effect on survival. The anticoagulant properties of APC are, however, associated with increased risk of bleeding complications and have thereby restricted its use in clinical practice. In the PROWESS study, serious bleeding complications were observed in 3.5% of the patients treated with APC compared with only 2% of the placebo group (19Bernard G.R. Vincent J.L. Laterre P.F. LaRosa S.P. Dhainaut J.F. Lopez-Rodriguez A. Steingrub J.S. Garber G.E. Helterbrand J.D. Ely E.W. Fisher Jr., C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent post-marketing studies have reported even higher incidences of serious bleeding complications (6.5 and 6.7%, respectively) in patients treated with APC (22Bertolini G. Rossi C. Anghileri A. Livigni S. Addis A. Poole D. Intensive Care Med. 2007; 33: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Kanji S. Perreault M.M. Chant C. Williamson D. Burry L. Intensive Care Med. 2007; 33: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this context, recent studies have sought to define the relative contributions of the cytoprotective and/or anticoagulant properties of APC toward mediating its therapeutic efficacy in different pathological settings. These studies have sought to design APC variants which retain beneficial cytoprotective actions but exhibit relative reduction in its anticoagulant properties and, thus, bleeding risk (24Bae J.S. Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9251-9259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Mosnier L.O. Gale A.J. Yegneswaran S. Griffin J.H.

The anticoagulant function of APC requires the presence of its principal cofactor, protein S (27Walker F.J. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1984; 10: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Protein S may enhance APC anticoagulant activity by increasing its affinity for negatively charged phospholipid surfaces (27Walker F.J. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1984; 10: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), re-positioning the APC active site for optimal substrate cleavage (28Yegneswaran S. Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5462-5468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), or removing the protection of FVa in the prothrombinase complex conferred by FXa binding (29Nicolaes G.A.

Thus, protein S plays a critical role in mediating the anticoagulant properties of APC, but there is no evidence to date that it is important for the anti-inflammatory or anti-apoptotic effects of APC. The molecular basis through which protein S interacts with APC is not fully understood; however, a possible role for the APC Gla domain has recently been described (30Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S. Dua S. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28850-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used a site-directed mutagenesis strategy to characterize the impact of individual amino acid residue substitutions in this putative protein S binding region upon APC anticoagulant function. We demonstrate that, surprisingly, a single amino acid substitution (L38D) is sufficient to entirely ablate the ability of protein S to function as a cofactor for this APC variant yet does not alter APC-mediated proteolysis of FVa in the absence of protein S. Consequently, in both protein S-dependent FVa proteolysis assays using purified coagulation proteins and in the plasma milieu, this APC Gla domain variant exhibited minimal residual anticoagulant activity compared with wild type APC. In addition, despite the fact that this key amino acid is located in the APC Gla domain, we also show that this APC variant interacts normally with EPCR and that it retains its ability to initiate PAR-1 protective signaling in an identical fashion to that of wild type APC. Generation and Characterization of Recombinant Protein C Variants—Recombinant protein C Gla domain variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed, and isolated from serum-free medium as previously described (30Preston R.J.

Recombinant protein C was characterized by Coomassie staining and immunodetection using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-protein C polyclonal antibody (Dako, Ely) and a mouse anti-Gla monoclonal antibody (American Diagnostica) according to standard procedures. To generate recombinant APC, wild type protein C and protein C variants were activated with Protac (Hyphen-BioMed). APC chromogenic substrate (BIOPHEN CS-21(66), Hyphen-Biomed) cleavage by each recombinant APC preparation was determined as previously described (30Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S.

Inhibition of APC in Plasma—Inhibition of APC variants in plasma was determined as previously described (32Berg D.T. Gerlitz B. Shang J. Smith T. Santa P. Richardson M.A. Kurz K.D. Grinnell B.W. Mace K. Jones B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4423-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Wild type and variant APC (20 nm) was incubated in pooled human citrated plasma at 37 °C. At designated time points, aliquots were removed, and the residual amidolytic activity was determined using a chromogenic substrate for APC (BIOPHEN CS2166). To examine the role of protein C inhibitor, the same experiments were performed in the presence of heparin (10 units/ml). Determination of APC Anticoagulant Activity in Protein C-deficient Plasma—The anticoagulant function of wild type and variant APC upon protein C-deficient plasma was assessed using a Fluoroskan Ascent Plate Reader (Thermo Lab System, Helsinki, Finland) in combination with Thrombinoscope software (SYNAPSE BV) as previously described (30Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S. Dua S. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28850-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 80 μl of protein C-deficient plasma (Hyphen-Biomed) was incubated with 20 μl of PPP reagent (Synapse) containing 5 pm tissue factor and 4 μm phospholipids (PC/PS/PE, 40%:20%:20%) in the presence or absence of wild type or variant APC (1.25–20 nm). Thrombin generation was initiated by automatic dispensation of fluorogenic thrombin substrate (Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-amidomethylcoumarin-HCl) and 100 mm CaCl2 into each well. Thrombin generation was determined using thrombin calibration standard (Synapse). Measurements were taken at 20-s intervals for 60 min or until thrombin generation was complete. The endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) of each reaction were then calculated. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are reported as the mean ETP ± S.E. Protein S Enhancement of APC Anticoagulant Activity in Protein S-deficient Plasma—The enhancement of APC anticoagulant activity in protein S-deficient plasma was determined using a similar assay to that described above. Briefly, protein S-deficient plasma (Hyphen-Biomed) was incubated with wild type or variant recombinant APC (10 nm) in the presence or absence of plasma-purified protein S (0.125–1.5 μm, Hematologic Technologies Inc.). Thrombin generation was initiated and assessed using Thrombinoscope software as described previously. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data plotted as mean ETP ± S.E. Determination of Protein S-independent APC-mediated Factor Va Proteolysis—FVa degradation by APC was assessed as previously described (30Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S. Dua S.

Phospholipid vesicles were prepared as described previously (31Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At the specified time points, 2-μl aliquots were removed and added to a prothrombinase mixture (25 μm phospholipids, 1 nm factor Xa, and 0.5 μm prothrombin (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) final concentrations) for 3 min. Each reaction was then stopped using 5 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m EDTA. 100 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and incubated with 100 μl of 2 mm thrombin chromogenic substrate Biophen CS-01(38Mille-Baker B.

The rate of chromogenic substrate cleavage was measured at 405 nm using a plate reader. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Determination of Protein S-enhanced Proteolysis of FVa by APC—Protein S-enhanced proteolysis of FVa by APC was determined as previously described (30Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S. Dua S. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28850-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human protein S (2.5–25 nm) was incubated with 0.8 nm wild type or variant APC, 8 nm FVa, and 75 μm phospholipids vesicles in 40 mm Tris HCl, pH7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (0.2 nm APC, 2 nm FVa, and 19 μm phospholipids vesicles, final concentrations) for 2 min at 37 °C. After this incubation, a 2-μl aliquot was added to 0.3 nm FXa, 1.5 μm prothrombin, and 75 μm phospholipids vesicles (0.1 nm FXa, 0.5 μm prothrombin, and 25 μm phospholipids vesicles, final concentrations) at 37 °C for 3 min, then stopped with 5 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m EDTA. The rate of thrombin substrate cleavage by the consequent reaction mixture was then measured as before. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and data were plotted as the mean residual FVa cofactor activity ± S.E. Assessment of APC Variant Binding to Soluble EPCR—APC binding to sEPCR was determined using a BIAcore X100 (GE Healthcare) as previously described (30Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S.

Fukudome, Saga Medical School), was immobilized on to both flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip. sEPCR (31Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in HBS-P buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20) was bound to the surface of the test flow cell (400–800 response units). A reference flow cell with only RCR-2 bound was used to detect nonspecific binding. Wild type or variant APC (25–100 nm) was sequentially injected over both flow cells at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 60 s. APC-EPCR binding was dissociated using HBS-EP buffer (HBS-P, but containing 3 mm EDTA; BIAcore) The RCR-2 surface was regenerated with 10 μl of 10 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) after each experiment. Measurement of Endothelial Cell Barrier Protection by APC—Endothelial cell barrier permeability was determined as described previously with minor modifications (13Feistritzer C. Riewald M. Blood. 2005; 105: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Briefly, EAhy926 cells (kind gift of Dr. C. Edgell, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) were grown to confluence on polycarbonate membrane transwells (Costar, 3 μm pore size, 12-mm diameter) and incubated with 20 nm wild type or variant APC. After 3 h the cells were treated with thrombin (Hematologic Technologies) in serum-free media for 10 min. The cells were washed and incubated with 0.67 mg/ml Evans Blue with 4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Changes in endothelial cell barrier permeability were determined by following the increase in absorbance at 650 nm in the outer chamber over time due to the transmigration of Evans Blue-bovine serum albumin. Experiments were performed in triplicate and plotted as the mean ± S.E. Determination of APC-mediated Protection of Apoptotic Endothelial Cells—Confluent EAhy926 cells in 6-well plates were pretreated with either wild type or variant APC for 17 h. EAhy926 cell apoptosis was induced by staurosporine (20 μm, Sigma) treatment for 4 h. Cells were then trypsinized, and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out (High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit, Applied Biosystems), then real time PCR was performed using bax (Hs00180269_m1), bcl-2 (Hs00153350_m1) and β-actin (Hs99999903_m1) Taqman® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) in a Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system. Experiments were performed in triplicate and plotted as the mean bax/bcl-2 ratio ±S.E. Characterization of Recombinant Protein C/APC Gla Domain Variants—To identify the critical amino acid residues in the APC Gla domain that mediate protein S cofactor enhancement of APC anticoagulant activity, recombinant protein C Gla domain variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis spanning a region of the Gla domain proposed to mediate protein S cofactor function (Fig. 1A). Each of these variants (APC-D35T, APC-D36A, APC-L38D, and APC-A39V) contains single amino acid substitutions with the corresponding residue of the human prothrombin Gla domain. This approach enables analysis of APC-specific functions while maintaining Gla domain structural integrity (30Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S. Dua S. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28850-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Each expressed recombinant protein C variant was characterized by Western blotting with an anti-protein C polyclonal antibody and an anti-Gla monoclonal antibody. Recombinant wild type and variant protein C migrated in a similar fashion to plasma-purified protein C under non-reducing conditions at the expected molecular mass of ∼65 kDa. Wild type and variant recombinant protein C exhibited similar band intensity when detected with both anti-protein C and anti-Gla antibodies to that observed with plasma-purified protein C, indicative of normal expression and post-translational modification of the recombinant proteins (Fig. 1B). For functional studies wild type and variant recombinant protein C were activated using Protac. The amidolytic activity of each recombinant APC variant was assessed and found to be identical to that of wild type APC (Fig. 1C). The rate of inhibition of each APC variant by serpins was determined in normal plasma. Inhibition of both wild type and variant APC was closely comparable (Fig. 1D). To examine the role of protein C inhibitor (PCI), the same experiment was performed in the presence of heparin, which accelerates PCI inhibition of APC. Accordingly, inhibition of wild type APC was enhanced 3-fold, as previously described (32Berg D.T. Gerlitz B. Shang J. Smith T. Santa P. Richardson M.A. Kurz K.D. Grinnell B.W. Mace K. Jones B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4423-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each APC variant was inhibited in a similar manner to that of wild type APC in this system (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, subsequent assays indicated that APC inhibition kinetics in the presence of purified α1-antitrypsin and protein C inhibitor were not affected by the presence of any of the APC variants tested (data not shown). Therefore, the residue substitutions present in each APC variant do not alter APC inhibition by its known plasma inhibitors. Determination of Recombinant APC Gla Domain Variant Anticoagulant Activity—To identify the specific APC Gla domain residue(s) responsible for mediating APC anticoagulant activity in plasma, the ability of wild type and variant APC to inhibit tissue factor-induced thrombin generation was assessed. Wild type APC diminished thrombin generation in a concentration-dependent manner, as previously described (30Preston R.J. Ajzner E. Razzari C. Karageorgi S. Dua S. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28850-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Variants APC-D35T, APC-D36A, and APC-A39V exhibited mildly impaired anticoagulant activity, with <2-fold reduced ETP compared with wild type APC (Fig. 2, A and B). Variant APC-L38D, however, exhibited severely impaired anticoagulant activity (Fig. 2, A and B). APC-L38D was unable to achieve half-maximal inhibition of thrombin generation (ETP) at concentrations as high as 150 nm APC (Fig. 2C), compared with half-maximal inhibition observed with wild type APC (7.2 nm; Fig. 2B). These data indicate that APC-L38D is at least 20-fold less active than wild type APC in plasma. Leu-38 Is Required for Protein S-dependent APC Anticoagulant Function in Protein S-deficient Plasma—To clarify the role of Leu-38 in facilitating APC anticoagulant function, the ability of APC-L38D to be stimulated in protein S-deficient plasma reconstituted with plasma purified protein S was determined. Wild type APC had no anticoagulant function in protein S-deficient plasma, as previously observed (33Hackeng T.M. Sere K.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, co-incubation of wild type APC with increasing protein S concentrations (12.5–200 nm) caused a corresponding reduction in thrombin generation (ETP) (IC50 = 24 nm protein S) (Fig. 3, A and B). Variant APC-L38D, however, was almost entirely unresponsive to protein S (Fig. 3, A and B). At the highest protein S concentration tested (1.5 μm), corresponding to 10-fold plasma free protein S concentration, thrombin generation was reduced only 22 ± 2% compared with thrombin generated in the absence of pro"
https://openalex.org/W2135539115,"In the event of a smallpox outbreak due to bioterrorism, delays in vaccination programs may lead to significant secondary transmission. In the early phases of such an outbreak, transmission of smallpox will take place especially in locations where infected persons may congregate, such as hospital emergency rooms. Air disinfection using upper-room 254 nm (UVC) light can lower the airborne concentrations of infective viruses in the lower part of the room, and thereby control the spread of airborne infections among room occupants without exposing occupants to a significant amount of UVC. Using vaccinia virus aerosols as a surrogate for smallpox we report on the effectiveness of air disinfection, via upper-room UVC light, under simulated real world conditions including the effects of convection, mechanical mixing, temperature and relative humidity. In decay experiments, upper-room UVC fixtures used with mixing by a conventional ceiling fan produced decreases in airborne virus concentrations that would require additional ventilation of more than 87 air changes per hour. Under steady state conditions the effective air changes per hour associated with upper-room UVC ranged from 18 to 1000. The surprisingly high end of the observed range resulted from the extreme susceptibility of vaccinia virus to UVC at low relative humidity and use of 4 UVC fixtures in a small room with efficient air mixing. Increasing the number of UVC fixtures or mechanical ventilation rates resulted in greater fractional reduction in virus aerosol and UVC effectiveness was higher in winter compared to summer for each scenario tested. These data demonstrate that upper-room UVC has the potential to greatly reduce exposure to susceptible viral aerosols. The greater survival at baseline and greater UVC susceptibility of vaccinia under winter conditions suggest that while risk from an aerosol attack with smallpox would be greatest in winter, protective measures using UVC may also be most efficient at this time. These data may also be relevant to influenza, which also has improved aerosol survival at low RH and somewhat similar sensitivity to UVC."
https://openalex.org/W1991648502,"Stress granules (SG) and processing bodies (PBs) are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles whose assembly is induced by different stimuli. SG are the site of storage of untranslated transcripts formed in response to environmental stress, whereas PBs are involved in mRNA turnover. We recently characterized a novel family of four human proteins related to the Caenorhabditis elegans Mex-3, a RNA binding protein involved in the establishment of the anterior-posterior embryonic asymmetry and in the maintenance of germline pluripotency. We now report that the adaptor proteins 14-3-3 bind to hMex-3B but not to the three other hMex-3 family members. Serine 462, when phosphorylated, is the major 14-3-3 docking site on hMex-3B, and manipulation of this interaction reveals that 14-3-3 both stabilizes hMex-3B and modulates its ability to bind RNA. Furthermore, the complex formed between hMex-3B and Argonaute proteins is excluded from PBs when the interaction with 14-3-3 is disrupted, whereas the recruitment to SG is not affected. Thus, 14-3-3 exerts combined effects on hMex-3B and acts as a major regulator of the sorting between distinct classes of RNA granules.

Furthermore, the complex formed between hMex-3B and Argonaute proteins is excluded from PBs when the interaction with 14-3-3 is disrupted, whereas the recruitment to SG is not affected. Thus, 14-3-3 exerts combined effects on hMex-3B and acts as a major regulator of the sorting between distinct classes of RNA granules. The regulation of mRNA translation and degradation plays a central role in the control of eukaryotic gene expression. It is increasingly evident that these posttranscriptional processes require the compartmentalization of ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) 4The abbreviations used are: mRNP, ribonucleoprotein complex; SG, stress granules; PB, processing bodies; KH, K homology; TAP, tandem affinity purification; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; TTP, tristetraprolin protein; YN, amino-terminal fragment; YC, carboxyl-terminal fragment; hMex, human Mex; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AMCA, aminomethylcoumarin acetate. in various cytoplasmic microdomains. Processing bodies (PBs) are one class of these RNA granules that are the sites of mRNA degradation and of storage of nontranslated transcripts (1Sheth U. Parker R.

Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Stress granules (SG) constitute another class of RNA granules larger than PBs. SG assembly is induced in plant and mammalian cells by various environmental stresses (3Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 9Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), such as heat, UV irradiation, and oxidative conditions. These structures are highly dynamic, and upon disappearance of stress conditions, they disassemble rapidly. SG aggregate stalled translation initiation complexes, including untranslated mRNA loaded on the 40 S ribosomal subunit, a subset of translation initiation factors, helicases, exonucleases, and several types of RNA-binding proteins (3Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). A large body of work has demonstrated that SG function as a triage center, redirecting mRNA fated to be degraded to PBs or allowing their transport to the cytoplasm where translation is reinitiated on polysomes (10Bhattacharyya S.N.

Furthermore, evidence has been obtained that relatively fixed SG interact with more motile PBs via a set of shared proteins, a docking process that is believed to favor the exchange of mRNAs between these two compartments (11Kedersha N. Stoecklin G. Ayodele M. Yacono P. Lykke-Andersen J. Fritzler M.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J.

We and others have recently identified a family of four human genes homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans Mex-3 that codes a RNA-binding protein which contains two tandemly repeated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology (KH) domains (13Donnini M. Lapucci A. Papucci L. Witort E. Jacquier A. Brewer G. Nicolin A. Capaccioli S. Schiavone N. J. Biol.

In the nematode, MEX-3 acts as a translational regulator that specifies posterior blastomere identity in the early embryo and contributes to the maintenance of germline totipotency (15Draper B.W. Mello C.C. Bowerman B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 16Hunter C.P. Kenyon C.

Human Mex-3 proteins (hMex-3A to -3D) are related RNA binding phosphoproteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and display differential localization to PBs (14Buchet-Poyau K. Courchet J. Le Hir H. Seraphin B. Scoazec J.Y. Duret L. Domon-Dell C. Freund J.N. Billaud M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We previously reported that hMex-3A and hMex-3B colocalize with the hDcp1a decapping factor in PBs, whereas hMex-3C is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, hMex-3 proteins display distinct modes of association with a subset of Argonautes proteins (Ago-1 and Ago-2), which are components of the RNA-induced silencing complex, the large key effector ribonucleoprotein complex of microRNA and of RNA interference pathways. 14-3-3s constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved, small acidic proteins that bind phosphorylated serine or threonine residues (19Hermeking H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Seven mammalian isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins (β, γ, ϵ, ζ, η, τ, and σ) have been identified that can form homo- or heterodimers and show little isoform specific substrate specificity except for the 14-3-3σ isoform (20Wilker E.W. Grant R.A. Artim S.C. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18891-18898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 binding regulates client protein localization or function, and 14-3-3s are involved in cell functions such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell metabolism (19Hermeking H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Here we report that 14-3-3 proteins associate specifically with hMex-3B but not with the three other hMex-3 proteins. Interaction with 14-3-3 depends on the phosphorylation of hMex-3B on serine 462, and this binding stabilizes hMex-3B protein and modulates its ability to bind RNA. Moreover, formation of this complex is a key step that regulates the sorting of both hMex-3B and associated-Ago proteins between PBs and SG, thus indicating that 14-3-3 is a modulator of the dynamic exchange of mRNPs that links PBs and SG. Constructs and Mutagenesis—Coding sequences for hMex-3A, hMex-3B, hMex-3C, and p62-sequestosome were cloned in pCMV-Tag3B vector (Stratagene) as described previously (14Buchet-Poyau K. Courchet J. Le Hir H. Seraphin B. Scoazec J.Y. Duret L. Domon-Dell C. Freund J.N. Billaud M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GFP-hDcp1a (a gift from B. Seraphin), pIRESneo-FLAG/HA Ago1 (a gift from T. Tuschl), pEYFP-Difopein (a gift from H. Fu), and pCS2+-HA-14-3-3eta (a gift from K. Blackwell) constructs were also used. Cloning of hMex-3D, pCMV-TAP, and pCMV-hMex-3B mutants and truncated forms is described under supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-myc (9E10), anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), anti-HA 11 (Covance), anti-actin (ICN), and anti-human PABP1 (10E10) (Sigma) antibodies were used in Western blots at 1:5,000, 1:1,000, 1:1,000, 1:25,000, and 1:2,000 dilutions, respectively. Anti-Myc, anti-GFP, and anti-HA antibodies were also used in immunofluorescence at 1:300 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal anti-M3Bß antibody was used for immunofluorescence and Western blots at 1:150 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-14-3-3β (H-8) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Phospho(Ser) 14-3-3 binding motif (4E2) antibody (Cell Signaling) were used in Western blots at 1:1000 dilution. Goat polyclonal anti-TIA-1 (C-20), rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF4G, and mouse monoclonal anti-P70-S6 kinase, which cross-reacts with the PBs component HEDLS (human enhancer of decapping large subunit) (21Kedersha N. Anderson P. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 431: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were used in immunofluorescence at 1:100 dilution. Cell Culture and Transfections—MCF7, HEK293, and BOSC cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated 24 h before transfection, and then plasmids were transfected into cells using ExGen 500 (Upstate Biotechnologies) or Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as a transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. When indicated, the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (Calbiochem) was used at 50 nm for 30 min. Tandem Affinity Purification and Mass Spectrometry—TAP-tagged hMex-3B protein was expressed in HEK293 cells. Cells were harvested and lysed 48 h after transfection. TAP purification was performed as described previously (22Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) (see a detailed protocol under supplemental “Materials and Methods”). Tandem affinity purification (TAP) protein complexes were submitted to SDS-PAGE on a Tris-HCl gradient precast gel (Bio-Rad). Mass spectrometry analysis is described under supplemental “Materials and Methods”. Protein Analyses and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection, and Western blot analyses and immunoprecipitations were performed as described earlier (14Buchet-Poyau K. Courchet J. Le Hir H. Seraphin B. Scoazec J.Y. Duret L. Domon-Dell C. Freund J.N. Billaud M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Nony P. Gaude H. Rossel M. Fournier L. Rouault J.P. Billaud M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9165-9175Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (see supplemental “Materials and Methods”). Quantitative Western blot analyses were performed using Li-Cor Odissey (Li-Cor Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction (see supplemental “Materials and Methods”). For immunoprecipitation, Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from protein extracts (1 mg) with the anti-Myc antibody (5 μg) as described earlier, and Western blot analyses were performed as described on the immunocomplexes obtained. To test for the phosphorylation of proteins, protein extracts prepared in lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 8 units of λ-phosphatase (Biolabs) per μg of protein. Protein extracts were treated with or without RNase A (0.2 mg/ml) before immunoprecipitation. Immunofluorescence—BOSC, MCF7, or HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips and were transiently transfected as described. After 48 h, cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized 5 min in 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked 20 min in PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated overnight with primary antibody diluted in PBS, bovine serum albumin at 4 °C and were incubated 1 h with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature. Cells were mounted with DakoCytomation Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DakoCytomation) and were observed with a confocal microscope TSC SP2 (Leica) at the Centre Commun de Quantimetrie (Université Claude Bernard Lyon I). For BiFC, cells were incubated for 4 h at 30 °C before immunofluorescence as described above to increase YFP maturation and yellow fluorescence. For characterization and quantification of hMex-3B containing granules, cells were transfected and stained as described above, and protein localization was observed by confocal microscopy. The size of hMex-3B-containing granules and colocalization with hDcp1 and TIA1 was evaluated for each transfected cell analyzed. Protein Half-life Determination—HeLa cells were transfected as described in 100-mm dishes, then were trypsinized 24 h after transfection and plated in 60-mm wells. Cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for the indicated times before lysis. Protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Signal intensity was quantified using a FluorS Multimager and QuantityOne (Bio-Rad). 14-3-3 Adaptor Proteins Interact Specifically with hMex-3B—To identify proteins interacting with hMex-3B, a TAP analysis was undertaken (22Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 24Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The TAP tag was fused to the aminoterminal region of hMex-3B, and we verified that the tag did not alter hMex-3B subcellular localization (data not shown). Upon transient transfection in HEK293 cells, TAP-tagged hMex-3B affinity-purified complexes were resolved on a 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. Whereas no proteins were purified using an empty pCMV-TAP vector as a negative control, two independent TAP analyses with TAP-tagged hMex-3B revealed two prominent bands between 30 and 33 kDa that were identified as five different isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins by mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table 1). To verify the interaction between hMex-3B and 14-3-3 proteins, Myc-tagged hMex-3 proteins were transiently expressed in BOSC cells. Cells were lysed in mild conditions that preserve protein-protein interactions followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody, and immunoblots were probed using an antibody that recognizes the seven known mammalian isoforms of 14-3-3. Under these conditions, endogenous 14-3-3 proteins were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with hMex-3B protein (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, this interaction was specific to hMex-3B as 14-3-3 proteins did not co-immunoprecipitate with either hMex-3A, -3C, or -3D. To further confirm the specificity of this interaction, BOSC cells were transfected with plasmids encoding hMex-3 proteins and HA-tagged 14-3-3η (one of the 14-3-3 isoforms identified by TAP analysis). Proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies, and immunoblotting analyses confirmed the specific association of hMex-3B and 14-3-3η (Fig. 1C). A much weaker interaction was also detectable between 14-3-3η and hMex-3C and -3D. Although hMex-3A expression is always lower than expression of other hMex-3 proteins, coprecipitation of 14-3-3η with hMex-3A was never observed ever with a stronger expression. Similarly, 14-3-3 proteins coimmunoprecipitated with hMex-3B in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 1). We next sought to determine whether hMex-3B/14-3-3 interaction was mediated by an mRNA bridge. hMex-3 proteins were expressed in BOSC cells, and the protein lysate was treated or not with RNase before immunoprecipitation. 14-3-3 coprecipitation was not abolished by RNase treatment (Fig. 1D); on the contrary, we observed that 14-3-3 interaction with hMex-3B was enhanced after RNase treatment. This result, thus, suggests that hMex-3B and 14-3-3s are part of the same protein complex and that hMex-3B/14-3-3 interaction increases when hMex-3B is not bound to mRNA. To further extend the physiological significance of these data, endogenously expressed hMex-3B protein was immunoprecipitated from BOSC cells with or without RNase treatment of the lysate. 14-3-3s did not coimmunoprecipitate either with a control preimmune rabbit serum or with an antibody directed against hMex-3A (Fig. 1E). A complex between hMex-3B and 14-3-3 can be observed only after RNase treatment of the lysate. Thus, this result confirms that endogenously expressed hMex-3B and 14-3-3s can form a complex under specific conditions. Interaction with 14-3-3 Requires Phosphorylation of hMex-3B on Ser-462—To determine which region of hMex-3B is necessary for 14-3-3 binding, we generated several truncated forms of hMex-3B consisting of the deletion of either the amino-terminal region containing the two KH domains involved in mRNA binding, the carboxyl-terminal domain containing the E3 ubiquitin-ligase RING domain, or the linker part (Fig. 2A). All corresponding proteins were expressed at similar levels in BOSC cells, except the hMex-3B 1-433 mutant protein, which was occasionally slightly less abundant (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Coprecipitation of 14-3-3 proteins to hMex-3B was still observed with the truncated forms that possess the carboxyl-terminal domain (hMex-3B Δ239-433 and 239-569) and even enhanced with the amino-terminal-deleted form (hMex-3B 239-569). On the contrary, 14-3-3 proteins did not associate with the truncated forms in which the carboxyl-terminal fragment was deleted (hMex-3B 1-433, 1-239, and 239-433). These data indicate that hMex-3B carboxyl-terminal region is necessary for hMex-3B/14-3-3 interaction. 14-3-3s constitute a family of related-proteins that bind to a phosphorylated serine/threonine residue embedded in a specific peptide sequence (19Hermeking H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, association of 14-3-3s with certain “client” proteins can also occur in a phosphorylation-independent manner (25Masters S.C. Pederson K.J. Zhang L. Barbieri J.T. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5216-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To examine whether hMex-3B/14-3-3 interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, hMex-3B proteins were expressed in BOSC cells, and protein extracts were dephosphorylated or not by λ-phosphatase treatment before immunoprecipitation with the anti-Myc antibody. Immunoblot analysis showed that 14-3-3 proteins coimmunoprecipitated specifically with hMex-3B in the absence of phosphatase treatment, whereas dephosphorylation of the lysate disrupted 14-3-3 interaction without changing reproducibly hMex-3B expression (Fig. 2C). Sequence analysis revealed that the sequence surrounding Ser-462 (RRVRpS462DP) of hMex-3B conforms to a putative 14-3-3 mode-II binding motif (26Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). This serine was replaced by an alanine by site-directed mutagenesis to generate hMex-3B mS462A. BOSC cells were transfected with either the Myc-tagged hMex-3B, the S462A mutant, or with an additional mutant that we previously reported (14Buchet-Poyau K. Courchet J. Le Hir H. Seraphin B. Scoazec J.Y. Duret L. Domon-Dell C. Freund J.N. Billaud M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that disrupts the second KH-domain (G177D) and abolishes mRNA binding both in vitro and in vivo. The cell-permeable phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A was added to the culture medium 30 min before lysis to reinforce hMex-3B phosphorylation, then hMex-3B proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody. The hMex-3B S462A mutant was reproducibly expressed at a lower level than the wild type, whereas hMex-3B G177D protein was more abundant (see below for a discussion of this point; Fig. 2D). 14-3-3 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type hMex-3B and the KH-domain mutant, the coprecipitation being enhanced by calyculin A treatment. In contrast, 14-3-3 proteins failed to associate with hMex-3B S462A even with calyculin A treatment. Similarly, 14-3-3 proteins did not coimmunoprecipitate with a mutant form of hMex-3B where Ser-462 has been replaced by a phosphomimetic residue such as glutamic acid (hMex-3B mS462E, Fig. 2E), as has been described for other proteins (27Hoffmeister M. Riha P. Neumuller O. Danielewski O. Schultess J. Smolenski A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2297-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Vander Haar E. Lee S.I. Bandhakavi S. Griffin T.J. Kim D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). We next employed a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes phosphoserine residues within a 14-3-3 binding consensus sequence (anti-phosphoserine 14-3-3 binding). A signal corresponding to hMex-3B was observed after immunoprecipitation with the wild-type and the KH (G177D) mutant, and this signal was increased upon phosphatase inhibition with calyculin A (Fig. 2D). This phosphoserine signal was lost when hMex-3B serine 462 was mutated to alanine even when cells were treated with calyculin A. In addition, a phosphoserine (14-3-3 binding) signal could be observed after hMex-3C and weakly after hMex-3D immunoprecipitation but not with hMex-3A (see Fig. 1B). The existence of a phosphoserine/threonine epitope on hMex-3C and hMex-3D is consistent with their weak binding to 14-3-3. Taken together, these results indicate that Ser-462 of hMex-3B is phosphorylated and is the major 14-3-3 docking site. To further extend this analysis, we used the YFP-tagged Difopein, a competitive inhibitor of 14-3-3 (29Masters S.C. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45193-45200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Difopein is composed of a tandemly repeated peptide sequence that binds 14-3-3 within its amphipathic groove in a phosphorylation-independent manner. BOSC cells were transfected with either YFP-Difopein expression vector or empty peGFP plasmids together with the wild-type or mutant hMex-3B expression vectors. As shown on Fig. 2F, Difopein inhibited 14-3-3 binding to both the wild-type and the hMex-3B G177D mutant. 14-3-3 binding inhibition correlated with a decrease of hMex-3B Ser-462 phospho-signal for the wild-type or the G177D mutant, as revealed by anti-phosphoserine (14-3-3 binding) antibody. Thus, these data indicate that 14-3-3s bind hMex-3B via their amphipathic groove, and this binding protects Ser-462 from dephosphorylation, similarly to what has been shown for the phosphatase CDC25C (30Margolis S.S. Walsh S. Weiser D.C. Yoshida M. Shenolikar S. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5734-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Binding Properties of hMex-3B to mRNA and 14-3-3—RNase treatment increases hMex-3B/14-3-3 interaction without any reproducible change of hMex-3B Ser-462 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). This result suggests a mechanistic link between mRNA binding and 14-3-3 docking to hMex-3B. Consistent with these findings, we found that more 14-3-3 coprecipitated with a hMex-3B-truncated protein that lacks the KH domains (Fig. 2B) or with the hMex-3B KH-domain mutant unable to bind mRNA (Figs. 2, E and F, and 3A) compared with the wild-type hMex-3B, although we observed that the KH mutant was always more expressed than wild-type hMex-3B (this point is discussed below). A mutation in the RING domain (C521G) did not perturb the association with 14-3-3, thus confirming the specificity of the effect observed with the KH mutant (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, we observed a slight, non-reproducible decrease of Ser-462 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 coprecipitation with this hMex-3B mutant (Fig. 3A and data not shown). As expected, a double mutation (S462A and G177D) abolished the increased interaction with 14-3-3. To accurately quantify the effects of either RNase A or λ-phosphatase treatments on hMex-3B/14-3-3s association, we exploited the infrared fluorescence imaging system (Odissey/Li-COR), which allows a wide quantitative linear range and high sensitivity of detection in Western blots. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, using this measurement we found that RNase A treatment increased by 2-fold 14-3-3s binding on hMex-3B, whereas it did not significantly modify the level of phosphoserine in a 14-3-3 binding site. As expected, upon λ-phosphatase treatment, the fixation of 14-3-3s on hMex-3B was completely lost. Taken together, these results suggest that 14-3-3s binding weakens the hMex-3B interaction with mRNA. 14-3-3 Binding Stabilizes hMex-3B Protein—During the course of our experiments, we repeatedly noticed that the hMex-3B S462A protein was expressed at a lower level than the wild-type hMex-3B, whereas the KH mutant was expressed at higher level. Because 14-3-3 binding is known to stabilize certain client proteins (31Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H. Aitken A. Skoulakis E.M. Orr H.T. Botas J.

HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant hMex-3B proteins together with the 14-3-3 inhibitor Difopein. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide and collected between 1 and 24 h of inhibition time. As shown on Fig. 4, Western blot analysis revealed a decrease of hMex-3B protein levels with a longer time course of cycloheximide treatment. In the absence of YFP-Difopein, hMex-3B G177D was more stable than the wild-type hMex-3B, whereas hMex-3B S462A was more rapidly degraded (Fig. 4A). Quantification of the signals obtained in 5 independent experiments followed by regression analysis indicated respective half-lives of 5.6, 11.8, and 4.4 h for hMex-3B, hMex-3B G177D, and hMex-3B S462A (Fig. 4B). Moreover, whereas the half-life of hMex-3B mS462A was practically unaffected when Difopein was expressed, those of the wild-type and G177D mutant hMex-3B proteins exhibited a marked decrease of stability to match that of hMex-3B mS462A (Fig. 4C). Quantitative analysis indicated a half-life of either 3.6, 4.4, and 3.6 h for wild-type, mG177D, and mS462A h"

Transducin is peripherally attached to membranes of the rod outer segment, where it interacts with other proteins at the membrane-cytosol interface. However, upon sustained activation by light, the dissociated Gtα and Gβ1γ1 subunits of transducin translocate from the outer segment to other parts of the rod cell. Here we used a computational approach to analyze the interaction strength of transducin and its subunits with acidic lipid bilayers, as well as the range of orientations that they are allowed to occupy on the membrane surface. Our results suggest that the combined constraints of electrostatics and lipid anchors substantially limit the rotational degrees of freedom of the membrane-bound transducin heterotrimer. This may contribute to a faster transducin activation rate by accelerating transducin-rhodopsin complex formation. Notably, the membrane interactions of the dissociated transducin subunits are very different from those of the heterotrimer. As shown previously, Gβ1γ1 experiences significant attractive interactions with negatively charged membranes, whereas our new results suggest that Gtα is electrostatically repelled by such membranes. We suggest that this repulsion could facilitate the membrane dissociation and intracellular translocation of Gtα. Moreover, based on similarities in sequence and electrostatic properties, we propose that the properties described for transducin are common to its homologs within the Gi subfamily. In a broader view, this work exemplifies how the activity-dependent association and dissociation of a G protein can change both the affinity for membranes and the range of allowed orientations, thereby modulating G protein function.

The G protein transducin is a key molecular switch in vertebrate rod cells (1Burns M.E. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 779-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 2Arshavsky V.Y.

Like other heterotrimeric G proteins, transducin is peripherally attached to the lipid bilayer by covalent lipid modifications of the N terminus of the α subunit and the C terminus of the γ subunit (4Bigay J.

During the rapid course of a photoresponse, each photoexcited rhodopsin activates tens of transducin heterotrimers (Gt) at a rate of hundreds of Gt molecules per second (6Leskov I.B. Klenchin V.A.

This activation catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on Gtα, which then dissociates from Gβ1γ1 and proceeds to activate the effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase. The fact that these protein-protein interactions take place at the membrane-cytosol interface is a key reason why the phototransduction cascade operates so rapidly and efficiently (8Calvert P.D.

The attachment of transducin to the disk membranes of rod outer segments is reversible, allowing transducin to undergo activation-dependent translocation from the light-sensitive outer segment compartment to the rest of the photoreceptor cell (10Sokolov M.

A similar phenomenon was also shown for the invertebrate visual G protein, Gq (11Kosloff M. Elia N. Joel-Almagor T. Timberg R. Zars T.D. Hyde D.R. Minke B. Selinger Z. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transducin translocation can be modulated by the interaction strength of the subunits with membranes (12Kassai H. Aiba A. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Xiong W.H. Yau K.W. Imai H.

However, the mechanisms underlying Gt translocation are still under intensive investigation (reviewed in Refs. 14Calvert P.D. Strissel K.J. Schiesser W.E. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y.

Several investigators examined the crystal structures of Gt and proposed a number of distinct Gt orientations relative to the membrane surface, based on constraints imposed by Gt lipid anchorage and evidence from Gt-rhodopsin interaction experiments. In some orientations the N-terminal helix of Gtα was placed parallel to the membrane (“parallel orientations”) (16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9395-9403Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to their lipid anchors, Gt and its individual subunits can interact electrostatically with the negatively charged membrane surface (16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E.

For instance, both Gt and its subunits can be detached from membranes by hypotonic but not isotonic buffers (26Kuhn H.

In a previous computational study, Murray et al. (30Murray D. McLaughlin S. Honig B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45153-45159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that Gβ1γ1 is attracted to the membrane electrostatically, accounting for experimental observations that Gβ1γ1 binds more strongly to negatively charged membranes than to neutral membranes (5Seitz H.R.

On the other hand, the electrostatic contribution to the interactions of Gtα with membranes is less clear. The membrane affinity of Gtα was shown to be smaller than the affinity of Gβ1γ1 in vitro, and several observations hint that Gtα could be repelled by the membrane (4Bigay J. Faurobert E. Franco M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14081-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Seitz H.R. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Alt T. Pellaud J. Seelig A.

Electrostatic repulsion is consistent with a qualitative examination of Gα subunits from the Gi subfamily, including Gtα, showing that their surfaces are dominated by negatively charged patches (32Kosloff M.

Here we used a quantitative computational approach to characterize the membrane affinity of transducin and the range of its allowed orientations next to the membrane as determined by lipid anchors and electrostatic interactions. We calculated electrostatic free energies using the Finite-Difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) 4The abbreviations used are: FDPB, Finite-Difference Poisson-Boltzmann; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 4The abbreviations used are: FDPB, Finite-Difference Poisson-Boltzmann; PDB, Protein Data Bank. method, which has been successfully applied to numerous protein-membrane systems, yielding results that reproduce experimental measurements with high accuracy (30Murray D.

We found that, in addition to the lipid anchorage of Gt, electrostatic repulsion further constrains the orientations of membrane-associated Gt, regardless of its orientation in the complex with rhodopsin, making some of the previously suggested Gt orientations more favorable than others. In contrast, Gβ1γ1 is attracted to the membrane in many lipid-allowed orientations. Finally, we showed that monomeric Gtα experiences a comparable degree of electrostatic repulsion. Using the FDPB Method to Calculate Electrostatic Potential and Free Energy—Electrostatic potentials and free energies were calculated with a modified version of the DelPhi program, adapted to solve the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for protein-membrane systems. DelPhi yields finite-difference solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (the FDPB method) for a system where the solvent is described in terms of a bulk dielectric constant and concentrations of mobile ions, whereas the solutes (here, the proteins and membrane) are described in atomic detail by the coordinates of the individual atoms, their atomic radii, and their partial charges. The FDPB methodology has been applied to numerous peptide-membrane and protein-membrane systems, producing results that predict successfully and with high accuracy the following: 1) macroscopic properties, such as quantitative differences between the membrane interactions of homologous proteins and effects of lipid composition or ionic strength; and 2) microscopic properties, such as the effect of point mutations or binding of metal ions on membrane interactions (for examples see Refs. 30Murray D.

Atomic Structural Models of Proteins and Membranes—The atomic model we used for the Gt heterotrimer was based on the Gαt/i1β1γ1 crystal structure (PDB code 1GOT) solved by Lambright et al. (16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Because the Gα subunit in this structure is a chimera of Gtα and Gi1α (residues 216-294 of bovine Gtα were replaced with residues 220-298 of rat Gi1α to improve protein expression), a composite model was built for heterotrimeric Gtα by manually copying the backbone and side chains of these residues from the corresponding region of native Gtα, taken from the Gtα-GDP structure (1TAG) (41Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The structure of these two corresponding regions is highly similar (16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), and their backbone root mean square deviation is 0.5 Å. The structure of bovine Gβ1γ1 (PDB code 2TRC) (42Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) was used in calculations for dissociated Gβ1γ1, as in a previous study (30Murray D. McLaughlin S. Honig B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45153-45159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both Gγ1 termini in the heterotrimeric model, which are slightly shorter than in the structure of dissociated Gβ1γ1, were extended by manually copying the extra residues from the structure of dissociated Gβ1γ1. The resulting structures contain all the charged residues of native transducin. The N terminus of Gtα, in its heterotrimeric form, is in an extended helical conformation and is stabilized by interactions with Gβ1γ1 (see supplemental Fig. S1 and Ref. 16Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). After dissociation from Gβ1γ1, this subdomain does not have any significant stabilizing interactions with the membrane (supplemental Fig. S2). Available structures of monomeric Gtα are not applicable to our calculations because they lack the entire N terminus, which was cleaved prior to crystallization. This raises the possibility that the N terminus of Gtα is intrinsically unstructured. However, we note that the N terminus in the crystal structure of the homologous Gi1α-GDP (68% sequence identity to Gtα) refolds onto the bulk of the protein to form a compact subdomain that is stabilized by a network of interacting residues that are conserved between Gi1α and its homologs Goα and Gtα (43Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A folded and highly ordered Gi1α N terminus was also shown for the myristoylated form of Gi1α in solution, and it was suggested that this feature is conserved in homologous Gα subunits (44Preininger A.M.

We therefore assumed that soluble GDP-bound Gtα adopts a similar conformation, and we modeled it on the structure of monomeric Gi1α-GDP (PDB code 1GDD) using the program Nest (45Petrey D. Xiang Z.

The numerical calculation of the potential was iterated to convergence, defined as the point at which the potential changes less than 10-5 kT/e between successive iterations. A sequence of focusing runs of increasing resolution was employed to calculate the electrostatic potentials (e.g. 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 grid/Å). Electrostatic energies were obtained using the calculated potentials, and the electrostatic energy of a protein-membrane interaction was determined as the difference between the following: 1) the electrostatic free energy of the protein in a specific orientation and distance relative to the membrane surface; and 2) the electrostatic free energies of the protein and membrane infinitely far apart (i.e. calculated separately). The numerical error of the free energy calculations, estimated by the difference between the calculations of the two highest resolution scales, was <0.1 kcal/mol in all calculations.

This insertion domain interacts with the anion-binding exosite (ABE)-II of thrombin. This study investigated whether and how γ′ chain binding to ABE-II affects thrombin interaction with its platelet receptors, i.e. glycoprotein Ibα (GpIbα), protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1, and PAR4. Both synthetic γ′ peptide and fibrinogen fragment D*, containing the elongated γ′ chain, inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation up to 70%, with IC50 values of 42 ± 3.5 and 0.47 ± 0.03 μm, respectively. Solid-phase binding and spectrofluorimetric assays showed that both fragment D* and the synthetic γ′ peptide specifically bind to thrombin ABE-II and competitively inhibit the thrombin binding to GpIbα with a mean Ki ≈ 0.5 and ≈35 μm, respectively. Both these γ′ chain-containing ligands allosterically inhibited thrombin cleavage of a synthetic PAR1 peptide, of native PAR1 molecules on intact platelets, and of the synthetic chromogenic peptide d-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide. PAR4 cleavage was unaffected. In summary, fibrinogen γ′ chain binds with high affinity to thrombin and inhibits with combined mechanisms the platelet response to thrombin.

Thus, its variations in vivo may affect the hemostatic balance in arterial circulation. Fibrinogen is a key molecule in both primary and secondary hemostasis, because of its role in forming the platelet plug by connecting activated platelets and in forming plasma fibrin clot upon thrombin cleavage. Fibrinogen consists of two symmetric half-molecules, each containing a set of three different polypeptide chains termed Aα, Bβ, and γ. The latter contains several sites that interact with different ligands such as other fibrin(ogen) molecules, coagulation enzymes, growth factors, and integrins (1Mosesson M.W. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The product of thrombin digestion of fibrinogen, i.e. fibrin, binds with a considerable specificity thrombin, so that in the early studies fibrin was termed antithrombin I (2Seegers W.H. Nieft M. Loomis E.C. Science. 1945; 101: 520-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thrombin has a divalent interaction with two classes of binding sites on fibrin, one of low affinity in the E domain and the other of high affinity in the D domain of fibrin(ogen) molecules (3Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Leslie B.A. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2470-2477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Binding of thrombin to fibrinogen involves sequences of both Aα and Bβ chain, which contain recognition sites in the fibrinogen E domain. These recognition sites are still able to interact with thrombin after cleavage of fibrinopeptide A and B and form the low affinity binding site for the enzyme. The D domains contain a γ chain variant, termed γ′, arising from an alternative mRNA splicing (4Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), resulting in an elongated chain composed of 427 instead of 411 residues. The inserted region at the C terminus is composed of 20 amino acids (408VRPEHPAETEYDSLYPEDDL427), rich of acidic side chains and two sulfate anions linked to Tyr418 and Tyr422 (5Farrell D.H. Mulvihill E.R. Huang S.M. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9414-9420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The elongated γ chain, termed γ′, mainly heterodimerizes in the fibrinogen molecule with the more abundant γA chain, thus generating the γA/γ′ dimers (6Uitte de Willige S. de Visser M.C. Houwing-Duistermaat J.J. Rosendaal F.R. Vos H.L. Bertina R.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 4176-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This fibrinogen, also called γA/γ′ fibrinogen, shows a high inter-individual variability in the ratio to the total fibrinogen γ chain (7Lovely R.S. Falls L.A. Al-Mondhiry H.A. Chambers C.E. Sexton G.J. Ni H. Farrell D.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The different expression of γ′ chain has been variably associated with thrombotic disorders both in venous and arterial circulation.Previous genetic studies showed, for instance, that the fibrinogen γ-H2 haplotype is characterized by a reduced fibrinogen γ′ levels and reduced fibrinogen γ′ to total fibrinogen ratio. This haplotype is associated with a significantly increased risk for venous thrombosis (6Uitte de Willige S. de Visser M.C. Houwing-Duistermaat J.J. Rosendaal F.R. Vos H.L. Bertina R.M. Blood. 2005; 106: 4176-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed that γ′ chains bind to α-thrombin with high affinity (8Meh D.A. Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23121-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and that the 408–427 region of γ′ chain binds to the anion-binding exosite (ABE) 2The abbreviations used are: ABE-I/II, thrombin anion binding exosite I/II; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; PAR, protease-activated receptor; AP, activating peptide; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; S-2238, d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA; Pip, pipecolyl; pNA, p-nitroanilide; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Gp, glycoprotein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 2The abbreviations used are: ABE-I/II, thrombin anion binding exosite I/II; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; PAR, protease-activated receptor; AP, activating peptide; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; S-2238, d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA; Pip, pipecolyl; pNA, p-nitroanilide; PEG, polyethylene glycol; Gp, glycoprotein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PDB, Protein Data Bank.-II of thrombin (1Mosesson M.W.

Chem. 2007; 125: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, fibrinopeptide B cleavage by thrombin from γ′/γA fibrinogen is slower than in γA/γA fibrinogen (10Cooper A.V. Standeven K.F. Ariens R.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This effect was also associated with a reduced lateral aggregation of fibrin fibrils. All these findings may contribute to explain the reported enhanced risk for venous thromboembolism associated with a reduced expression of γ′ chain. However, at variance with these findings, other studies showed that fibrin fibers containing γ′ chains are more resistant than γ chains to proteolysis by fibrinolytic enzymes (11Falls L.A. Farrell D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14251-14256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), so that fibrin clots containing a more abundant amount of γ′ chains could be associated with higher thrombotic risk. Notwithstanding the decreased sensitivity to fibrinolytic enzymes, the influence of a reduced expression of γ′/γA on enhanced risk for venous thromboembolism was prevalently demonstrated in clinical studies, although the detailed mechanism was only partially unraveled.At variance with venous thromboembolism, the significance of altered expression of γ′ chain on arterial thrombosis remains largely elusive (6Uitte de Willige S. de Visser M.C.

Platelets are major players of arterial thrombus formation, as also demonstrated by the clinical efficacy of anti-platelet agents in cardiovascular prevention. The fibrinogen γ′ chain, through its ability to bind to thrombin, might enhance the amount of clot-bound thrombin, known to be active in the presence of the heparin-antithrombin complex, and thus scarcely inactivated by traditional anticoagulants (heparins, indirect Factor Xa inhibitors) (3Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Leslie B.A. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2470-2477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, clot-bound, active thrombin may represent a storage pool of the enzyme, facilitating arterial thrombus formation and growth.In this study, we investigated the effect of the fibrinogen γ′ and also of its 20-amino acid-insertion peptide on the thrombin interaction with the platelet receptors glycoprotein (Gp) Ibα and protease-activated receptors 1 and 4 (PAR1 and PAR4), responsible for the thrombin-induced platelet activation. Fragment D was used as the best surrogate to selectively study the high affinity binding site for thrombin in γ chain in a conformation similar to that present in the native fibrinogen molecule and suitable for thrombin binding studies. This experimental approach was aimed at assessing whether γ′ chain can affect platelet activation by inhibiting competitively the interaction between the enzyme and GpIbα and by acting as an allosteric effector on PAR hydrolysis by thrombin. The obtained results may shed light on the possible role of fibrinogen γ′ chain on the thrombin-induced platelet activation and thus on possible implications on both anti-thrombotic and pro-thrombotic properties of fibrinogen in arterial circulation, where platelets play a central role in thrombo-hemorrhagic syndromes.MATERIALS AND METHODSSynthesis of Fibrinogen γ′ Peptide—The fibrinogen γ′ 408–427 peptide (408VRPEHPAETEYDSLYPEDDL427) and its scrambled sequence peptide (PTAHDYVDEERPYLPEELSD) as a control were synthesized by the peptide synthesis facility of the Brain Research Center at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). The tyrosine residues 418 and 422 were phosphorylated, as these residues were sulfated in natural γ chains (5Farrell D.H. Mulvihill E.R. Huang S.M. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9414-9420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The RP-HPLC analysis showed that these peptides were 95% pure, with a molecular mass of 2580.3 ± 0.2 atomic mass units, as determined by mass spectrometry.Purification of Fibrinogen γA/γA and γA/γ′ D Fragments—Both γA/γA (D) and γA/γ′ (D*) fragments of fibrinogen were purified by a modified procedure, as reported previously (14Kuyas C. Haeberli A. Straub P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1107-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human fibrinogen, free of plasminogen was purchased from Calbiochem. This preparation was chromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow XK column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (GE Healthcare) to separate the fibrinogen fraction rich in γ′ chains. The column was equilibrated with 5 mm sodium phosphate, 40 mm Tris, pH 8.50, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One gram of fibrinogen was adsorbed on the column. After the elimination of nonadsorbed proteins, fibrinogen fractions were eluted using a stepwise gradient and three different eluting buffer solutions as follows: 1) 30 mm sodium phosphate, 60 mm Tris, pH 7.60; 2) 50 mm sodium phosphate, 80 mm Tris, pH 6.80; 3) 500 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m Tris, pH 4.40. All these buffers contained 1 mg/ml aprotinin as protease inhibitor. Three major peaks were obtained, and the fibrinogen fraction containing one γA and one γ′ chain was eluted with the third buffer solution, whereas the fraction containing two γA chains was obtained with the first buffer. D fragments were prepared from plasmin digests of the first and the third peak obtained by DEAE chromatography and gel-filtered on DG-10 columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.50. Human plasmin (specific activity, 5 units/mg; Calbiochem) was added at a final concentration of 0.05 unit/ml (0.01 mg/mg fibrinogen) and incubated with the pooled and concentrated fibrinogen peaks 1 and 3 of the DEAE chromatography in the above buffer at 25 °C for 120 min. The fibrinogen was pretreated for 15 min with 5 mm iodoacetamide to inhibit any minimal trace of contaminating Factor XIII before the addition of plasmin. The reaction was stopped by the addition of aprotinin (10 mg/ml final concentration). Fragment D (containing γA chains only) and D* (containing γ′ chain only) were purified from peaks 1 and 3, respectively, using a second DEAE column (Supelco, Sigma), 4.6 × 25 mm, and a two-pump HPLC apparatus (Jasco Easton, MD), equipped with a spectrophotometric device (model 2075), and a spectrofluorometric detector (FP-2020, Jasco). The spectrophotometric detection of the eluted peaks was accomplished at 280 nm, whereas the fluorescence of the proteins was monitored by using λex = 280 nm and λem = 340 nm. The developed gradient was 0–0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in 60 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Fragment D was eluted at about 0.2 m NaCl, whereas fragment D* was obtained at ∼0.45 m NaCl. The concentration of fragment D and D* was calculated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of E0.1% = 2.0 cm2·mg-1, using the primary sequence of fragment D and the spectrophotometric method by Pace et al. (15Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the fragment D and D* were pooled and concentrated, and their purity was checked by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% gradient gels under both not reducing and reducing conditions. The identity of the γ′ chain was checked by immunoblotting of the bands obtained in SDS-PAGE of reduced fragment D*, using a mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody (clone 2.G2.H9) from Millipore S.p.A. (Milano, Italy), a secondary anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and an ECL™ Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). The γA chains obtained from reduced fragment D did not react with the monoclonal antibody 2.G2.H9 (data not shown).Thrombin-Fragment D* Interaction—Human α-thrombin was purified and characterized as reported previously (16De Cristofaro R. Rocca B. Bizzi B. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Binding of thrombin to purified fibrinogen fragment D* was studied by a solid-phase binding assay, immobilizing fragment D* (5 μg/ml) on microtiter plates (96-well; Nunc-Immuno Maxisorp Nunc), overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.60. The plate surface was blocked at 37 °C for 4 h with 250 μl/well of a buffer solution containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After aspiration of the blocking solution, plates were dried at room temperature and stored over desiccant at 4 °C. Use of the anti γ′ chain monoclonal antibody 2.G2.H9 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) allowed us to obtain a quantitative estimate of the amount of immobilized fragment D*. Under the above conditions, the amount of immobilized fragment D* was equal to about 10 ng/well (about 0.12 pmol/well). This estimate was based on the use of serial dilutions of a reference solution of the 2.G2.H9 monoclonal antibody, whose Alexa 488 fluorescence was measured using λex = 494 nm and λem = 520 nm. Thus, at maximum saturation using 100 μl of the buffer solution, about 1 nm thrombin could be bound by immobilized fragment D*. Control experiments were also performed using fragment D instead of fragment D* at the same concentration.Thrombin (78 nm to 5 μm) was incubated for 30 min in the absence and presence of the C-terminal domain 45–57 of hemadin, a specific ligand for ABE-II of thrombin (17Richardson J.L. Kroger B. Hoeffken W. Sadler J.E. Pereira P. Huber R. Bode W. Fuentes-Prior P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5650-5660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal peptide of hemadin had the sequence NH2-SEFEEFEIDEEEK-OH and was synthesized by the solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method (18Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1989Google Scholar) on a p-alkoxybenzyl ester polystyrene resin, using a method detailed previously (19De Cristofaro R. De Filippis V. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) The chemical identity of the purified material was established by high resolution mass spectrometry in positive ion mode on a Mariner electrospray ionization-time-of-flight instrument from PerSeptive Biosystems (Foster City, CA), which gave mass values in agreement with the expected amino acid composition within 10 ppm mass accuracy. The concentration of the peptide was determined by UV absorption at 257 nm on either a double-beam l-2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or a Varian Cary 2200 spectrophotometer (Assoc. Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), using a molar absorption coefficient of 400 m-1·cm-1. The hemadin peptide was used at a fixed concentration spanning from 2 to 16 μm. The binding buffer was 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, pH 7.50, at 25 °C (TBSP). In a different experimental setup, the C-terminal hemadin peptide was substituted by the γ′ peptide, used over a 22.5–180 μm concentration range, to test whether or not the latter behaves as a pure competitive inhibitor. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, and aspiration with three washing cycles with TBSP, a sheep anti-thrombin polyclonal antibody (∼10 mg/ml, from US Biological, Milan, Italy) was added at an optimal dilution of 1:500 in TBSP and incubated for 120 min. After aspiration of the solutions and three washing cycles, 100 μl of rabbit anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody (∼2 mg/ml, dilution 1:250) from US Biological (Milan, Italy) was added and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. After aspiration and three washing cycles, 100 μl of 5 mm 3,5,3′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in the presence of 5 mm H2O2 was added, and the reaction was stopped after 15 min using 1 m H2SO4. This end point was chosen based on preliminary experiments showing a linear increase of the absorbance (15 points, R > 0.95) over that time interval even at the highest concentration of thrombin. This finding ruled out that the absorbance measured after 15 min of incubation did not reflect the real amount of thrombin bound to fragment D* and was not because of substrate depletion. An entire data set of thrombin binding to fragment D* (35 points) was simultaneously fitted to the Equation 1, A=Amax(T/(T+Kd∗))(Eq. 1) where A is the value of the absorbance measured at 450 nm; Amax is the asymptotic value of the absorbance; T is the thrombin concentration; and Kd* is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of thrombin binding to fragment D*, equal to K 0d (I/Ki), with K 0d as the real equilibrium binding constant; I is the concentration of either fragment D* or γ′ peptide, and Ki is the equilibrium dissociation constant of binding of these ligands to thrombin.Binding of Fibrinogen γ′ Peptide to Thrombin Studied by Tryptophan Fluorescence—Binding of γ′ peptide to thrombin was studied by recording the increase in tryptophan fluorescence of thrombin at λmax (i.e. 334 nm) as a function of fibrinogen γ′ peptide. The interaction of the latter with thrombin was monitored by adding, under gentle magnetic stirring, to a solution of thrombin (1.4 ml, 50 nm) in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1% PEG, in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl, aliquots (2–5 μl) of γ′ peptide (2.33 mm). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) model FP-6500 spectrofluorometer, equipped with a Peltier model ETC-273T temperature control system from Jasco. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 334 nm, respectively, using an excitation/emission slit of 10 nm. For all measurements, the long time measurement software (Jasco) was used. Control experiments were also performed to ruled out not specific effects, using the γ′ peptide scrambled peptide at a concentration of 100 μm. Under these conditions, at the end of the titration, a Trp photobleaching lower than 2% was observed. The absorbance of the solution at both 295 and 334 nm was always lower than 0.05 unit, and therefore no inner filter effect occurred during titration experiments. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for dilution (2–3% at the end of the titration) and subtracted for the contribution of the ligand at the indicated concentration. The fluorescence values, measured in duplicate, were analyzed as a function of the γ′ peptide concentration by a hyperbole equation to obtain the value of the Fmax (corresponding to the fluorescence at γ′ peptide concentration = ∞). This parameter was used to calculate ΔFmax = Fmax - Fo (where Fo is the fluorescence value in the absence of the peptide). The fluorescence changes expressed as (Fobs - Fo)/ΔFmax were analyzed as a function of the total γ′ peptide concentration according to a single site binding isotherm. Nonlinear least squares fitting was performed using the program Origin 7.5 (MicroCal Inc.), which allowed us to obtain the best fitting parameter values along with their standard errors.Effect of γ′ Peptide and Fragment D* on Thrombin-GpIbα Interaction—Solid phase binding experiments to evaluate the effect of fibrinogen γ′ peptide on thrombin-GpIbα-(1–282) interaction were performed as detailed above by immobilizing purified GpIbα-(1–282) fragment (10 μg/ml) on polystyrene plates. Purification of platelet GpIbα-(1–282) fragment was performed as detailed previously (20De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Rutella S. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3887-3895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thrombin (20 nm to 1.28 μm) was incubated in the presence of both 408–427 γ′ peptide and fragment D* at fixed concentrations spanning from 10 to 320 μm and from 0.2 and 3.2 μm, respectively. The binding buffer was TBSP. Both the experimental procedure of the binding assay and the analysis of the experimental data sets were the same as those used to study the thrombin-fragment D* interaction, detailed above. Control experiments, in which different concentrations of GpIbα(1–282) fragment from 0.31 to 10 μg/ml were immobilized on the microplate wells for binding to 10 nm thrombin, showed that in the time scale of the horseradish peroxidase reaction with 3,5,3′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (15 min), the signal at 450 nm was always linear for all tested GpIb fragment concentrations. These results validated the assumption that in this solid-phase binding assay the absorbance measured at 450 nm after 15 min reflected the amount of thrombin bound to GpIb. Additional control experiments were also carried out with the synthetic peptide analog GpIbα-(268–282), as a competitive inhibitor of thrombin binding to the immobilized GpIb-(1–282) fragment. This peptide, encompassing the C-terminal tail 268–282 of GpIbα, was synthesized and characterized as detailed previously (19De Cristofaro R. De Filippis V. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The three sulfated tyrosines, present in the natural peptide sequence (residue 276, 278, and 279), were replaced by phosphotyrosine.Effect of HD1 and HD22 Aptamers on Thrombin-Fragment D* Interaction—The ssDNA-aptamers 5′-GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG-3′ (HD1) and 5′-AGTCCGTGGTAGGGCAGGTTGGGGTGACT-3′ (HD22) were synthesized by Primm s.r.l. (Milano, Italy). HD1 and HD2 are ssDNA aptamers, which specifically bind to ABE-I and ABE-II, respectively (21Tasset D.M. Kubik M.F. Steiner W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In these experiments 500 nm α-thrombin was added to fragment D*, immobilized on microplates as detailed in the previous paragraph, in the presence of different concentrations of HD22 (20–1280 nm) and HD1 (87.5–5600 nm) and incubated for 60 min. The detection of bound thrombin was performed by an immunoassay, as described previously.Hydrolysis of Chromogenic Substrate d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA by Thrombin in the Presence of γ′ Peptide and Fibrinogen Fragment D*—Steady state hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2238 was studied in the absence and presence of six different γ′ peptide concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 320 μm and fragment D* concentrations spanning from 0.2 to 3.2 μm. Thrombin was used at 1 nm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, pH 7.50, at 25 °C.Hydrolysis of PAR1-(38–60) and PAR4(44–66) Peptide by Thrombin—PAR1-(38–60) (38LDPRSFLLRNPNDKYEPFWEDEE60) and PAR4-(44–66) (44PAPRGYPGQVCANDSDTLELPDS66) peptides were synthesized by PRIMM (Milan, Italy). Cleavage of these peptides by 0.1–1 nm thrombin was monitored by RP-HPLC as detailed previously (22De Candia E. Hall S.W. Rutella S. Landolfi R. Andrews R.K. De Cristofaro R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4692-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The Michaelis-Menten parameters kcat and Km were calculated in the absence and presence of fixed concentrations of the γ′ peptide ranging from about 2.5 to 320 μm. The kcat/Km values of PAR1 peptide hydrolysis in the presence of fragment D* (from 0.2 to 6.4 μm) was calculated at a peptide concentration of 1 μm, which is a concentration lower than the Km value of the thrombin-PAR interaction. Under these conditions, the first order rate constant of the peptide hydrolysis was proportional to the kcat/Km value, as experimentally verified. The hydrolysis reaction was performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, pH 7.50, at 25 °C. The kcat/Km values were analyzed as a function of both γ′ peptide and fibrinogen fragment D* using the following linkage Equation 2 (23De Cristofaro R. Peyvandi F. Palla R. Lavoretano S. Lombardi R.

Control experiments were also carried out using 320 μm scrambled γ′ peptide to exclude spurious effects generated by ionic strength phenomena.Binding of [Fluorescein]-Hirudin54–65(PO3H2) to Human α-Thrombin in the Absence and Presence of γ′ Peptide—Fluorescein-conjugated and phosphorylated C-terminal hirudin-(54–65) peptide, [F]-hirudin54–65(PO3H2), having the sequence GDFEEIPEEY(PO3H2)LQ, was synthesized as described previously (24Liu L.W. Vu T.K. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16977-16980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of this peptide to ABE-I of thrombin was studied by monitoring the decrease of the peptide fluorescence occurring upon interaction with thrombin, as reported previously (25Verhamme I.M. Olson S.T. Tollefsen D.M. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6788-6798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) spectrofluorometer, as detailed above. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 492 and 516 nm, respectively, using an excitation/emission slit of 3/5 nm. During titration experiments, the decrease of fluorescence intensity at 516 nm was recorded as a function of thrombin concentration. For all measurements, the long time measurement software (Jasco) was used. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for dilution (i.e. 8–10%) at the end of the titration.Data were analyzed by the following binding isotherm Equation 3 (26Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), using the program Origin 7.5 (MicroCal Inc.), (F−F0ΔFmax)=(α2)×(1+Kd+LP0−((1+Kd+LP0)2−4×LP0))+1(Eq. 3) where α is the maximum fluorescence change; Kd is the dissociation constant; L is the total concentration of thrombin; and P0 is the concentration of [F]-hirudin54–65 (PO3H2).Thrombin-induced Aggregation of Gel-filtered Platelets—Platelets from healthy volunteers were gel-filtere"
https://openalex.org/W2050258803,"The p53 family consists of p53, p63, and p73. It has been well characterized that all of the p53 family proteins are transcription factors and capable of regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. To determine whether the p53 family exerts tumor suppression by other mechanisms, we set to identify novel p53 family target genes. Here, we found that the gene encoding STX6 (syntaxin 6), a vesicle transporter protein, is directly regulated by each of the p53 family proteins. In addition, STX6 can be induced by DNA damage and Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 in a p53-dependent manner. To examine how STX6 mediates the activity of the p53 family, STX6 is inducibly overexpressed or knocked down in various cell lines. We found that overexpression of STX6 alone has limited effect on cell proliferation. In contrast, we found that knockdown of STX6 inhibits cell proliferation and survival. We also found that knockdown of STX6 leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that p53 is necessary for STX6 knockdown-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that STX6 is necessary for proper expression of focal adhesion kinase and integrin α5 adhesion receptor. Consistent with this observation, STX6 knockdown inhibits cell adhesion. Together, we postulate that STX6 is an effector and a modulator of the p53 family in the regulation of cell adhesion and survival. The p53 family consists of p53, p63, and p73.

Together, we postulate that STX6 is an effector and a modulator of the p53 family in the regulation of cell adhesion and survival. As a transcription factor, p53 activates a number of genes, such as p21, MDM2, IGFBP3, PIDD, and Killer/DR5, to regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). p63 and p73, both of which are members of the p53 family, are capable of inducing both common and distinct groups of target genes (1Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies showed that p63 can regulate a gene involved in cell adhesion in mammary epithelial cells, and loss of p63 induces cell detachment and death (2Carroll D.K. Carroll J.S.

However, it is not clear whether these p63 target genes involved in cell adhesion are also regulated by p53 and p73; nor is certain whether p53 and p73 can regulate a gene involved in cell adhesion. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) 3The abbreviations used are: NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; SNARE, NSF attachment protein receptor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RE, responsive element; nt, nucleotide(s); PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; GM1, a ganglioside with one sialic acid. attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins are key mediators of membrane fusion. SNAREs share a 60–70-residue sequence called the SNARE motif, which mediates the interaction between vesicle SNAREs (v-SNAREs) and target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs) (4Martinez-Arca S. Rudge R. Vacca M. Raposo G. Camonis J. Proux-Gillardeaux V. Daviet L. Formstecher E. Hamburger A. Filippini F. D'Esposito M. Galli T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9011-9016Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 6 (STX6), a v-SNARE protein, was identified through its homology to the yeast SNARE pep12p (5Bock J.B. Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17961-17965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and later found to be the closest ortholog of the yeast Tlg1p (6Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). STX6 is expressed in trans-Golgi and endosomes and found to be associated with a variety of SNARE proteins (7Wendler F. Page L. Urbe S. Tooze S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Wendler F. Tooze S. Traffic. 2001; 2: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, STX6 has been reported to regulate the caveolae- but not clathrin-dependent endocytosis (9Choudhury A. Marks D.L. Proctor K.M. Gould G.W. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a tyrosine kinase, is tightly linked to cell adhesion through the regulation of the interaction between the extracellular matrix and integrin receptors (10Cohen L.A. Guan J.L. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2005; 5: 629-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). FAK is found to be associated with integrin receptors and recruits other molecules to the site of their interaction, thus forming a signaling complex that transmits signals from the extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton (11Cox B.D. Natarajan M. Stettner M.R. Gladson C.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition, the integrin-FAK complex has been implicated in the regulation of anchorage-dependent cell survival (12Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies showed that FAK interacts with p53 and inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and subsequently p53-dependent apoptosis (13Golubovskaya V.M. Finch R. Cance W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25008-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Ilic D. Almeida E.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, disruption of FAK signaling results in apoptosis (15Xu L.H. Owens L.V. Sturge G.C. Yang X. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the apoptotic response induced by disruption of FAK and cell adhesion is different from the classic apoptotic response, and thus the cell death is called anoikis (16Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27393-27400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we identified STX6, a novel p53 family target gene. We found that although overexpression of STX6 has no significant effect on cell proliferation, knockdown of STX6 profoundly inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell death. Thus, we postulate that STX6 is an effector of the p53 family in the regulation of cell adhesion and survival. Plasmids—HA-tagged STX6 was amplified by PCR using an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank™ number BC009944) as a template. To generate STX6 with an HA tag at its N terminus, the following pair of primers was used: sense primer, 5′-GAAGCTTGCCGCCATGGAGTACCCATACGACGTACCAGATTACGCTATGTCCATGGAGGACCCCTTC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-ggaattcTCACAGCACTAAGAAGAGGATG-3′. To generate STX6 with an HA tag at its C terminus, the following pair of primers was used: sense primer, 5′-gaagctt GCC GCC ATGTCCATGGAGGACCCCTTC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-ggaattctcaAGCGTAATCTGGTACGTCGTATGGGTACTCCAGCACTAAGAAGAGGATGAG-3′. To generate a construct that expresses siRNA against STX6 under the control of the tetracycline-regulated H1 promoter, two 65-base oligonucleotides targeting STX6 from nucleotide +356 to +375 (GenBank™ number NM_005819) were designed as previously described (17Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar, 18Liu G. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1398-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The pair of oligonucleotides was then annealed and cloned into pBabe-H1 at HindIII and BglII sites, and the resulting construct was designated pBabe-H1-siSTX6. pBabe-H1 is a PolIII promoter-driven vector with a tetracycline operon sequence inserted before the transcription start site (19van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To generate a luciferase reporter under the control of a potential p53-responsive element in the STX6 gene, the STX6 promoter fragment from nucleotide -762 to -343 (the first nucleotide upstream of the putative transcription start site is designated as -1) was amplified and cloned into O-Fluc reporter vector upstream of a c-fos basic promoter and a luciferase reporter (20Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A mutant p53-responsive element (p53-RE) with three point mutations (C-369A, C-360T, and G-357A) was also amplified and cloned into O-Fluc. The fragments were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture—RKO, MCF7, and HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. HCT116 (p53-/-) is a derivative of HCT116 in which the p53 gene was somatically knocked out (21Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 22Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). RKO-p53-KD is a derivative of RKO in which p53 was stably knocked down by RNA interference (18Liu G. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1398-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The H1299 and MCF7 cell lines, which inducibly express p53, p53 (R249S), p63α, ΔNp63α, p63γ, ΔNp63γ, p73β, or ΔNp73β, were as previously described (23Dohn M. Nozell S. Willis A. Chen X. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 223: 221-235PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nozell S. Wu Y. McNaughton K. Liu G. Paik J. Chen X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4333-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). RKO and MCF7 cell lines, which inducibly express HA-tagged STX6, were generated as previously described (23Dohn M. Nozell S. Willis A. Chen X. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 223: 221-235PubMed Google Scholar). To generate inducible STX6 knockdown cell lines, pBabe-H1-siSTX6 was transfected into MCF7 and RKO cells in which a tetracycline repressor is expressed by pcDNA6 (26Yan W. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7856-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The STX6 knockdown cell lines were selected with puromycin and confirmed by Western blot analysis. To generate inducible STX6 knockdown cell lines with p53 stable knockdown, pBabe-H1-STX6 siRNA was cotransfected with pBabe-U6-p53 siRNA into MCF7 cells, in which a tetracycline repressor is expressed by pcDNA6. The resulting STX6 and p53 dual knockdown cell lines were selected with puromycin. Both STX6 knockdown and p53 knockdown were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Luciferase Assay—A dual luciferase assay was performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, p53-null H1299 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate and allowed to recover overnight. Cells were then cotransfected with 200 ng of O-Fluc reporter vector along with pcDNA3 or a pcDNA3 vector expressing wild-type p53, p53 (R249S), p63γ, ΔNp63γ, p73β, or ΔNp73β. As an internal control, 5 ng of pRL-CMV, a Renilla luciferase vector (Promega), was also cotransfected per well. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, luciferase activity was measured with the dual luciferase kit and Turner Designs luminometer. The -fold increase in relative luciferase activity is a product of the luciferase activity induced by a p53 family protein divided by that induced by empty pcDNA3 vector. ChIP Assay—The ChIP assay was performed as previously described (27Harms K.L. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2014-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). RKO cells were mock-treated or treated with doxorubicin for 24 h, whereas MCF7 cells were uninduced or induced to express Myc-tagged p63γ or HA-tagged p73β for 24 h. Chromatins in these cells were then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, sonicated to generate 200–1000-bp DNA fragments, and immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 antibody to capture p53-DNA complexes, with anti-Myc antibody to capture Myc-tagged p63γ-DNA complexes, or with anti-HA antibody to capture HA-tagged p73β-DNA complexes. After reverse cross-linking and phenol-chloroform extraction, the bound DNA fragments were purified by a Qiagen column. PCR was performed to visualize enriched DNA fragments. The primers designed to amplify the p53-RE within the STX6 promoter were as follows: sense, 5′-CCTGAAAAGCCGACTGCCTAGT-3′; antisense, 5′-GCGGGGCTTACGCCTGCGTCCC-3′. The primers designed to amplify the upstream p53-RE1 within the p21 promoter and GAPDH were as previously described (29Qian Y. Zhang J. Yan B. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2896-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Yan W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9117-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The following two pairs of primers were used to amplify the STX6-upstream control region and the STX6-downstream control region: upstream sense (5′-TATAACAGGCTAGTGAAGGAGCAGG-3′) and upstream antisense (5′-CAGAAATAAGGAGATGGCAACACAG-3′); downstream sense (5′-TTCTGTTGCCCAGACTGGAGTGC-3′) and downstream antisense (5′-CCGAGACAGGTGGATCACAAGGTC-3′). DNA Histogram Analysis—Cells induced or uninduced to express or knock down STX6 for various times were collected and fixed in 75% ethanol for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in a staining buffer containing 100 μg/ml RNase A and 50 μg/ml propidium iodine (Invitrogen). The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle (sub-G1, G1, S, and G2-M) was analyzed by a FACS-Caliber cell sorter (BD Biosciences) along with CellQuest software. Cell Attachment Assay—Six-well plates were coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin at 37 °C for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by PBS wash twice. The coated plates were kept at 4 °C until use. MCF7 cells, which were induced or uninduced to knock down STX6 for 36 h, were seeded at 20,000 cells on the fibronectin-coated plates with 2 ml of culture medium/well and incubated in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min. The unattached cells in the medium were collected, gently washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, and then counted by a Beckman Coulter counter. The attached cells were trypsinized and also counted. The ratio of the attached cells to the total number of cells at the control condition was set at 100%. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from H1299, RKO, MCF7, and HCT116 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis and preparation of p21 and GAPDH probes were as described previously (31Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4257-4263PubMed Google Scholar). The STX6 probe, a 1.5-kb XhoI-EcoRI fragment, was made from an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank™ number BC009944). Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Cells were collected from culture plates in PBS, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, and boiled for 7 min at 95 °C. Anti-Stx6 antibody was purchased from synaptic system (Germany). Other antibodies used were anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies (DO-1, PAb1801, PAb240, and PAb421), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p21 (C-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Mdm2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FAK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-integrin α5 (Chemicon), anti-PYK kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-clathrin heavy chain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (12CA5 and HA11) (Covance), and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) (Cell Signaling). STX6 Is a Novel Target Gene of the p53 Family—As a transcription factor, the p53 family exerts its function by regulating various genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. To determine whether a gene involved in cell adhesion can be regulated by the entire p53 family proteins, we performed a microarray array using RNAs purified from MCF7 cells uninduced or induced to express p63γ. Many genes were found to be up-regulated. Among these is the STX6 gene. To confirm the microarray analysis, Northern blot analysis was performed and showed that the expression level of STX6 was markedly increased by p63γ in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 5 and 6). In addition, ΔNp63α was also capable of inducing STX6 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 7 and 8). To examine whether STX6 is a common p53 family target, the level of STX6 was examined in MCF7 cells uninduced or induced to express p53, p53 (R249S), p73β, or ΔNp73β. We found that STX6 was induced by wild-type p53, p73β, and ΔNp73β but not mutant p53 (R249S) (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2, 4, 10, and 12 with lanes 1, 3, 9, and 11, respectively). In addition, the expression level of p21 was measured as a positive control. As expected, p21 was induced markedly by wild-type p53, p63γ, and p73β; induced mildly by ΔNp63α and ΔNp73β; and not induced by mutant p53 (R249S) (Fig. 1A). The expression level of GAPDH was measured as a loading control (Fig. 1A). We note that STX6 is located on chromosome 1Q25.3. Based on the NCBI data base, the STX6 gene encodes two transcripts through alternative splicing at the 3′-untranslated region. One transcript has 4,500 nucleotides (NM_005819), whereas the other has 1,500 nucleotides (BC009944). As shown in Fig. 1A, both the long and the short transcripts were expressed in MCF7 cells, and the expression levels for both transcripts were increased by the p53 family. Next, we wanted to know whether the increased levels of STX6 transcripts correlate with an increase in the levels of STX6 protein. Western blot analysis was performed and showed that upon induction, the level of STX6 protein was increased by wild-type p53, p63α, ΔNp63α, p63γ, ΔNp63γ, p73β, and ΔNp73β but not mutant p53(R249S) (Fig. 1B). In addition, the level of p21 was measured and found to be increased by wild-type p53, p63α, ΔNp63α, p63γ, ΔNp63γ, p73β, and ΔNp73β but not mutant p53(R249S) (Fig. 1B). The level of actin was measured as a loading control (Fig. 1B). To further make certain that STX6 is a true target of p53, we examined whether activated endogenous p53 is able to induce Stx6. To test this, tumor cells with endogenous wild-type p53 or in which endogenous p53 was stably knocked down by siRNA or somatically knocked out were treated with Nutlin-3, an inhibitor of Mdm2. Since Mdm2 is a negative inhibitor of p53, inhibition of Mdm2 by Nutlin-3 leads to p53 activation (32Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E.A. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3803) Google Scholar). Indeed, we showed that upon treatment with Nutlin-3, p53 was stabilized along with induction of Mdm2 in RKO, MCF7, and HCT116 cells, all of which carry an endogenous wild-type p53 (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1, 5, and 9 with lanes 2, 6, and 10, respectively). In contrast, when p53 was stably knocked down by siRNA (RKO-p53-KD and MCF-p53-KD) or somatically knocked out (HCT116-p53-/-), Nutlin-3 treatment had no effect on p53 accumulation and Mdm2 induction (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3, 7, and 11 with lanes 4, 8, and 12, respectively). Next, Northern blot analysis was performed to measure the level of STX6 transcripts upon p53 activation. We showed that the levels of STX6 were markedly increased in p53-proficient cells (RKO, MCF7, and HCT116 cells) (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1, 5, and 9 with lanes 2, 6, and 10, respectively). In contrast, when p53 was stably knocked down by siRNA or somatically knocked out, the levels of STX6 transcripts were not significantly altered (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3, 7, and 11 with lanes 4, 8, and 12, respectively). Again, the transcript levels of p21 and GAPDH were measured as positive and loading controls, respectively (Fig. 1D). Finally, we examined the levels of STX6 protein in HCT116 and p53-null HCT116 cells upon treatment with various chemotherapy agents (doxorubicin, camptothecin, and apigenin) or the Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. We found that the level of STX6 protein was increased in HCT116, but not p53-null HCT116, cells (Fig. 1E). We note that upon comparing the basal levels of STX6 in p53-proficient and -deficient cells, the levels of STX6 were lower in p53-knockdown and p53-null cells than that in p53-proficient cells (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1, 5, and 9 with lanes 3, 7, and 11, respectively; Fig. 1E, compare lane 1 with lane 6), suggesting that the basal expression level of STX6 is regulated by p53. As a transcription factor, the p53 family proteins bind to a specific DNA sequence in a target gene and activate the gene expression. Thus, we searched for a potential p53 family RE in the STX6 gene. One potential binding site (designated as STX6 p53-RE) was found to be located at nt -379 to -355 in the STX6 promoter (the first nt upstream of the transcription start site is designated as -1) with the following sequence: tGc CTAG TTC TGA GG GAA CAAG CCa. Upon alignment with the consensus p53 binding site, the p53-RE in the STX6 gene has three mismatches in the noncritical region (the lowercase letters represent mismatches) (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether the p53 family can activate the STX6 transcription through this potential p53-RE, the promoter fragment from nt -913 to -344, which carries one copy of the potential p53-RE, was cloned into O-Fluc reporter vector under the control of the c-fos basic promoter to drive the expression of luciferase. A mutant STX6 promoter fragment (G-358A, C-361T, and C-369A) was also cloned into O-Fluc (Fig. 2A). We found that the wild-type, but not mutated, STX6 promoter was responsive to wild-type p53 (Fig. 2B). Mutant p53 (R249S) was inert (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the wild-type, but not mutated, STX6 promoter was responsive to p63γ, ΔNp63γ, p73β, and ΔNp73β (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the expression patterns of STX6 upon induction of various p53 family proteins (Fig. 1). Next, we performed a ChIP assay to identify and confirm the direct binding of various p53 family proteins to the potential p53-RE in the STX6 gene. To examine p53 binding to the STX6 gene, RKO cells were untreated or treated with doxorubicin to activate p53. After cross-linking with formaldehyde and sonication, the p53-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated by anti-p53 antibody. Anti-HA antibody was used as a negative control. PCR was used to amplify the potential STX6 DNA fragment associated with p53 protein (Fig. 3A). The p53 binding to p53-RE1 in the p21 promoter was used as a positive control. Additionally, a region within the promoter of the GAPDH gene was amplified as a control for nonspecific binding. We also designed two pairs of primers to amplify the regions upstream and downstream of the potential p53-RE, respectively (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, we found that the STX6 fragment containing the potential p53-RE was markedly enriched (Fig. 3B). In addition, the p21 fragment containing p53-RE1 was also enriched (Fig. 3B). No enrichment was observed by control anti-HA (Fig. 3B). In addition, no p53 binding to GAPDH or to the upstream and downstream regions in the STX6 gene was detected (Fig. 3B). We also examined whether p63 and p73 bind to the potential p53-RE in the STX6 gene. To this end, MCF7 cells were uninduced or induced to express Myc-tagged p63γ or HA-tagged p73β. The p63-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody along with anti-HA as a control. The p73-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody along with anti-Myc as a control. We found that both p63γ and p73β bound to the potential p53-RE in the STX6 gene (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, the p21 promoter fragment containing p53-RE1 was also enriched (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, no enrichment was observed by anti-HA control for p63 and anti-Myc control for p73 (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, no p63 or p73 binding to GAPDH or to the upstream and downstream regions in the STX6 gene was detected (Fig. 3, C and D). Overexpression of STX6 Has No Major Effect on Cell Proliferation— As a p53 family target, overexpression of STX6 may be able to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To test this, we generated multiple cell lines, including MCF7 and RKO, that inducibly express STX6 under the control of tetracycline-inducible promoter. One representative RKO cell line (RKO-HA-STX6#17) and two representative MCF7 cell lines (MCF7-HA-STX6#5 and MCF7-STX6-HA#1) are shown in Fig. 4A. Growth rate analysis was performed and showed that over a 5-day testing period, overexpression of STX6 had only a mild effect on cell proliferation in RKO and MCF7 cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with this, DNA histogram analysis was performed and showed that upon induction of STX6 for 3 days, the number of cells in G1 was slightly increased (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, overexpression of STX6 had no significant effect on the activation and transcriptional activity of p53 in MCF7 cells upon treatment with doxorubincin (Fig. 4D). Physiologically Relevant Levels of STX6 Are Necessary for Cell Proliferation and Survival—To further determine the biological function of STX6 in the p53 family pathway, we generated MCF7 cell lines in which endogenous STX6 can be inducibly knocked down. Three representative cell lines (MCF7-STX6-KD#68, MCF7-STX6-KD#113, and MCF7-STX6-KD#173) were chosen for further analysis (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis showed that upon induction of siRNA against STX6, the level of STX6 protein was reduced by 60–80%. To determine whether STX6 is necessary for cell survival, growth rate and colony formation assays were performed. We showed that upon knockdown of STX6, MCF7 cells failed to proliferate over a 5-day testing period (Fig. 5B). In addition, MCF7 cells failed to form colonies (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we observed that 48 h after STX6 knockdown, some MCF7 cells started to detach from the plate, and on the third day, many cells lost their ability to attach to the plates. Thus, we performed DNA histogram analysis to examine whether STX6 knockdown leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5D, upon STX6 knockdown for 24 h, MCF7 cells started to undergo cell cycle arrest as the number of cells in the G1 phase was increased by ∼4% along with a concomitant decrease of cells in the S phase. Interestingly, upon prolonged knockdown of STX6 for 48 and 72 h, both numbers of cells in sub-G1 and G1 phases were markedly increased (Fig. 5D). Cells with a sub-G1 DNA content are a conservative measurement of cells undergoing apoptosis. To further demonstrate that knockdown of STX6 leads to apoptosis, we measured the level of cleaved PARP, one of the caspase substrates during apoptosis. We showed that PARP was cleaved upon knockdown of STX6 (Fig. 5E, compare lanes 6 and 8 with lanes 5 and 7). To demonstrate that the effect of STX6 knockdown on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis is not cell type-specific, we generated RKO cell lines in which STX6 can be inducibly knocked down. Two representative cell lines, RKO-STX6-KD#38 and RKO-STX6-KD#58 are shown in Fig. 6A. Similar to the observations in MCF7 cells, knockdown of STX6 led to growth suppression (Fig. 6, B and C) and apoptosis (Fig. 6D). It is well established that the p53 family proteins and some of their targets positively or negatively regulate each other, forming a feedback loop (1Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to examine whether p53 plays a role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by STX6 knockdown. To test this, we generated multiple cell lines in which STX6 can be inducibly knocked down and endogenous wild-type p53 was stably knocked down by siRNA. Western blot analysis was performed to measure the levels of STX6 and p53. Two representative cell lines (M7-(p53-KD)-STX6-KD#68 and STX6-KD#72) were identified in which lev"

Cl−/HCO3− exchange coupled with Na+-dependent acid extrusion can mediate pH-neutral Na+ uptake, potentially affecting Ca2+ handling via effects on Na+/Ca2+ exchange. AE3 null mice appeared normal, however, and AE3 ablation had no effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated hearts or cardiac performance in vivo. The NKCC1 Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter also mediates Na+ uptake, and loss of NKCC1 alone does not impair contractility. To further stress the AE3-deficient myocardium, we combined the AE3 and NKCC1 knock-outs. Double knock-outs had impaired contraction and relaxation both in vivo and in isolated ventricular myocytes. Ca2+ transients revealed an apparent increase in Ca2+ clearance in double null cells. This was unlikely to result from increased Ca2+ sequestration, since the ratio of phosphorylated phospholamban to total phospholamban was sharply reduced in all three mutant hearts. Instead, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity was found to be enhanced in double null cells. Systolic Ca2+ was unaltered, however, suggesting more direct effects on the contractile apparatus of double null myocytes. Expression of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 was increased in all mutant hearts. There was also a dramatic reversal, between single null and double null hearts, in the carboxymethylation and localization to the myofibrillar fraction, of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, which corresponded to the loss of normal contractility in double null hearts. These data show that AE3 and NKCC1 affect Ca2+ handling, PLN regulation, and expression and localization of major cardiac phosphatases and that their combined loss impairs cardiac function.

At least four electroneutral Cl−/HCO3− exchangers, termed AE1, AE2, AE3 (Slc4a1–3), and PAT1 or CFEX (Slc26a6), are expressed in cardiac muscle (1Kudrycki K.E. Newman P.R. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

In epithelial tissues, Cl−/HCO3− exchange coupled with Na+/H+ exchange or Na+/HCO3− cotransport mediates NaCl absorption across apical membranes, serves as a NaCl uptake system on basolateral membranes to facilitate anion secretion, and contributes to increases in cell volume (8Knickelbein R.

Because their activities are balanced, the resulting fluxes of acid-base equivalents and electrolytes take place with little or no change in pHi. 3The abbreviations used are: pHi, intracellular pH; I/R, ischemia-reperfusion; AE3–/– mice/cells, AE3 homozygous null mutant mice/cells; LVEDP, left ventricular end diastolic pressure; MAP, mean arterial pressure; LVP, left ventricular pressure; NKCC1–/– mice/cells, Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter null mutant mice/cells; KO, knock-out; DKO, double knock-out. 3The abbreviations used are: pHi, intracellular pH; I/R, ischemia-reperfusion; AE3–/– mice/cells, AE3 homozygous null mutant mice/cells; LVEDP, left ventricular end diastolic pressure; MAP, mean arterial pressure; LVP, left ventricular pressure; NKCC1–/– mice/cells, Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter null mutant mice/cells; KO, knock-out; DKO, double knock-out. Similarly, in cardiac myocytes, Cl−/HCO3− exchange acting alone would acidify the cell, impairing contractility; instead, there is evidence that such Cl−/HCO3− exchange operates in concert with Na+-coupled acid extrusion (14Camilion de Hurtado M.C. Alvarez B.V. Perez N.G. Ennis I.L. Cingolani H.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes contain an abundance of Na+ transport mechanisms mediating substantial levels of inward Na+ flux with major physiological effects (15Bers D.M. Barry W.H. Despa S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 897-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Pieske B. Houser S.R. Hasenfuss G. Bers D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that major ion fluxes resulting from these coupled transport mechanisms involving Cl−/HCO3− exchange would significantly impact Ca2+ handling and cardiac contractility. Ischemia causes pHi to decline and Cl– levels to rise in cardiac myocytes or hearts (17Kawasaki H. Otani H. Mishima K. Imamura H. Inagaki C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 411: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nonspecific stilbene derivatives, known to inhibit Cl−/HCO3− exchange and other HCO3− transporters, reduce these changes in pHi and Cl– levels (18Lai Z.F. Nishi K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1613-H1619PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Cl−/HCO3− exchange contributes to the observed perturbations caused by ischemia. Stilbene derivatives also limited Ca2+ loading, which leads to hypercontracture injury during reoxygenation (17Kawasaki H. Otani H. Mishima K. Imamura H. Inagaki C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 411: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating that Na+ loading coupled to Cl−/HCO3− exchange may increase [Na+]i and therefore Ca+ loading beyond what would occur as a result of Na+/H+ exchange alone. However, it is unclear whether the beneficial effects of stilbene derivatives are due to inhibition of one or more of the Cl−/HCO3− exchangers or to inhibition of Na+/HCO3− cotransport in the heart, since stilbene derivatives also inhibit Na+/HCO3− cotransport, which is functionally equivalent to Na+/H+ exchange and appears to be involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury (19Khandoudi N. Albadine J. Robert P. Krief S. Berrebi-Bertrand I. Martin X. Bevensee M.O. Boron W.F. Bril A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 52: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In order to gain a better understanding of the functions of the Cl−/HCO3− exchangers in cardiac muscle, we developed a mouse model in which the AE3 gene was disrupted and analyzed both the response to ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated hearts and cardiac performance in vivo. The absence of an overt cardiac phenotype suggested the possibility that the effects of AE3 deficiency were being masked by the activities of the three remaining Cl−/HCO3− exchangers, coupled with one or more of the Na+-dependent acid extrusion systems in the heart, and the NKCC1 Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransporter (Slc12a2). Although loss of NKCC1 alone has shown no effect on cardiac contractility (20Meyer J.W. Flagella M. Sutliff R.L. Lorenz J.N. Nieman M.L. Weber C.S. Paul R.J. Shull G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1846-H1855PubMed Google Scholar), NKCC1 ablation reduced Ca2+ levels in astrocytes (21Lenart B. Kintner D.B. Shull G.E. Sun D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9585-9597Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) via effects on Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Thus, to further stress the Na+ loading capacity of the AE3-deficient myocardium, we combined the AE3 and NKCC1 knock-outs. We hypothesized that cardiac function would be compromised in double null hearts because of effects on Ca2+ handling. Our data showed that loss of AE3 and NKCC1 together impaired cardiac contractility and altered Ca2+ handling via modulation of both NCX (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger)-mediated Ca2+ transport and PLN expression and phosphorylation. However, since these alterations did not significantly impact SR Ca2+ stores, it seemed likely that the impaired contractility in double null hearts was the result of effects on the contractile apparatus. Biochemical studies revealed that ablation of either AE3 or NKCC1 had similar effects on the expression and/or localization of the two principal phosphatases PP1 and PP2A (protein phosphatase 1 and 2A), both of which are known to regulate myofibrillar proteins and cardiac contractility. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that AE3-mediated Cl−/HCO3− exchange and NKCC1-mediated Na+-K+-2Cl– cotransport are intimately involved in the regulation of cardiac contractility and suggest that they serve very similar functions.

The probe used for Southern blot analysis was a 0.54-kb BamHI-SmaI fragment extending from exon 1 to exon 2, which allowed analysis of homologous recombination at the 5′-end of the gene. To confirm homologous recombination at the 3′-end of the gene, the 3′-arm of the targeting construct was used as a probe. Chimeric male mice were bred with Black Swiss mice, and mutant offspring were identified by Southern blot analysis. For the I/R injury studies, the AE3 null and wild-type mice were of the original mixed 129SvJ and Black Swiss background. For studies of cardiovascular performance in vivo, AE3 null and wild-type mice of both the mixed background and an inbred FVB/N background were analyzed. For in vivo cardiovascular studies in which the NKCC1 knock-out (24Flagella M. Clarke L.L. Miller M.L. Erway L.C. Gianella R.A. Andringa A. Gawenis L.R. Kramer J. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N.

AE3 null mutant and wild-type mice used for in vivo studies were generated by breeding AE3 heterozygous mice. AE3/NKCC1 double null mutant and wild-type mice were generated by breeding double heterozygous mutants. Mutant and wild-type mice for each experiment were derived from the same group of breeding pairs, and sibling pairs were used as often as possible. The AE3/NKCC1 double null and wild-type mice used for in vivo studies were obtained from the initial double knock-out breeders; the in vitro Ca2+ imaging and myocyte mechanics studies used double KOs and WTs derived from double heterozygous breeders from later generations of this colony. Genotype analysis was performed by PCR using DNA from tail biopsies and sets of three primers that simultaneously amplify fragments from the wild-type and mutant alleles. For AE3, the PCR contained a primer (5′-GACAATAGCAGGCATGCTGG-3′) derived from the 3′-end of the neoR gene, a forward primer (5′-GATGAAGATGACAGCCCAGG-3′) from exon 5 of the AE3 gene, and a reverse primer (5′-GACTAGGTGGGGACACCCTC-3′) from the region of intron 6 preceding the heart-specific exon. These primers amplify 785-base pair and 605-base pair products from the wild-type and mutant alleles, respectively. For NKCC1, PCR genotyping of wild-type and mutant alleles was performed as described previously (24Flagella M. Clarke L.L. Miller M.L. Erway L.C. Gianella R.A. Andringa A. Gawenis L.R. Kramer J.

Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the heart and brain of adult wild-type, AE3 heterozygous, and AE3 homozygous mutant mice using the Tri-Reagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and Northern blots were prepared and hybridized as described previously (23Gawenis L.R. Ledoussal C. Judd L.M. Prasad V. Alper S.L. Stuart-Tilley A. Woo A.L. Grisham C. Sanford L.P. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Langendorff Heart Studies—Susceptibility of wild-type and AE3 null hearts (n = 6 hearts/genotype) to impaired cardiac function resulting from I/R injury was analyzed using a Langendorff apparatus as described for the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 knock-out (25Wang Y. Meyer J.W. Ashraf M. Shull G.E. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that a 30-min period of no-flow ischemia was used. Analysis of in Vivo Cardiac Performance—Left ventricular function and mean arterial blood pressure of anesthetized adult male and female mice were analyzed using the intact closed chest model, as described previously (26Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar, 27Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N.

Left ventricular pressure was recorded via a high fidelity transducer (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) inserted into the left ventricle, and arterial blood pressure was recorded from a fluid-filled catheter in the femoral artery. A femoral vein catheter was used for infusion of dobutamine, a β-adrenergic agonist. Ca2+Transient Analysis and Ventricular Myocyte Mechanics—Cardiomyocytes were enzymatically dissociated from ventricles of 3–5-month-old mutant and wild-type hearts mounted in a Langendorff perfusion apparatus (28Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Ca2+ imaging was carried out as described before (29Braz J.C. Gregory K. Pathak A. Zhao W. Sahin B. Klevitsky R. imball T.F. Lorenz J.N. Nairn A.C. Liggett S.B. Bodi I. Wang S. Schwartz A. Lakatta E.G. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Robbins J. Hewett T.E. Bibb J.A. Westfall M.V. Kranias E.G. Molkentin J.D. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Analysis of Ca2+ transients elicited by application of caffeine was carried out as previously described (30Ji Y. Zhao W. Li B. Desantiago J. Picht E. Kaetzel M.A. Schultz, J el J. Kranias, E. G. Bers D.M. Dedman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H599-H606Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult ventricular myocytes were initially stimulated at a constant frequency of 0.5 Hz. 10–15 s after the last stimulation, 10 mm caffeine was added to the bath solution, and the rate and amplitude of fluorescent changes were measured using a dual excitation fluorescence photomultiplier system. Ventricular myocyte mechanics were determined using an edge detection camera that allowed simultaneous recordings of cell length changes. Immunoblot Analysis—Mice were anesthetized with avertin, and hearts were excised, rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C until further use. Each heart was manually pulverized in liquid N2 and then homogenized in Buffer H (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors) using a Polytron 3000 mechanical homogenizer. Protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Total homogenate was separated into soluble and myofibrillar fractions, as previously described (31Golenhofen N. Ness W. Koob R. Htun P. Schaper W. Drenckhahn D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1457-H1464PubMed Google Scholar), with minor variations. Briefly, 2 mg of total homogenate was resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4 plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors), homogenized using the Polytron 3000 homogenizer, and fractionated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet, identified as the myofibril-enriched fraction, was resuspended in the fractionation buffer. Proteins were resolved on a discontinuous, reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed for specific proteins using the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-SERCA2a (sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum isoform 2a; clone 2A7-A1; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), monoclonal anti-NCX (catalog number R3F1; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland), anti-PLN (catalog number MA3-922; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), anti-phosphoserine 16-phospholamban and anti-phosphothreonine 17-phospholamban (catalog numbers A010–12 and A010–13; Badrilla Ltd., Leeds, UK), anti-nonmethylated PP2A-C (catalytic subunit of PP2A; catalog number 4957 clone 4B7; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-PP2A-C (catalog number 05-421, clone 1D6; Millipore, Temecula, CA), anti-PP1-C (catalytic subunit of PP1) antibody raised against recombinant human PP1α and expected to cross-react with PP1β and PP1γ in addition to detecting PP1α (catalog number MAB3000, clone 319319; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Chemiluminescence was developed using the LumiGlo chemiluminescent substrate kit (KPL), and autoradiograms were developed using BioMax Films ML and MR (Eastman Kodak Co.). Anti-PP2A-C antibody (clone 1D6) is methylation-sensitive (32Wei H. Ashby D.G. Moreno C.S. Ogris E. Yeong F.M. Corbett A.H. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1570-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and binds demethylated PP2A-C with greater affinity than the methylated PP2A-C. Demethylation of PP2A-C was carried out by cold base treatment of the membrane as previously described (33Yu X.X. Du X. Moreno C.S. Green R.E. Ogris E. Feng Q. Chou L. McQuoid M.J. Pallas D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Statistics—For group comparisons, a mixed factor analysis of variance with repeated measures on the second factor was used. Individual comparisons were performed using Student's t test. AE3–/–Mice Were Indistinguishable from Wild-type Littermates and Were Fertile—The targeting strategy (Fig. 1A) was designed to eliminate both the 1227-amino acid AE3 variant in brain and the 1030-amino acid variant in heart. Any mRNA transcribed from the promoter for the long form would lack codons 209–319 and would either be disrupted by the neomycin resistance gene or contain a frameshift if it were deleted. The absence of the transcription start site and first two exons of the heart-specific transcript ensured the loss of this mRNA. Targeted embryonic stem cells were identified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B), and breeding of heterozygous mutants yielded offspring of all three genotypes (Fig. 1C) in a normal Mendelian ratio. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1D) revealed abundant mRNA for the long and short forms of AE3 in wild-type brain and heart, respectively, but not in brain or heart of AE3–/– mice. AE3–/– mice grew normally and were indistinguishable from wild-type mice in both appearance and behavior, and both male and female mutants were fertile. Heart weight/body weight ratios for AE3–/– and wild-type mice of the original 129SvJ and Black Swiss mixed background were 5.97 ± 0.17 mg/g and 6.98 ± 0.39 mg/g, respectively (p = 0.034, n = 7 for each genotype). As discussed below, however, loss of AE3 by itself had no apparent effect on I/R injury or cardiac performance in vivo, and heart weight/body weight ratios for AE3/NKCC1 double knock-out mice, where a defect in cardiac performance was observed, were not significantly different from wild-type controls. Loss of AE3 Did Not Affect Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury—Loss of Na+/H+ exchange or Na+/HCO3− cotransport activity protects against I/R injury (19Khandoudi N. Albadine J. Robert P. Krief S.

Physiol. 2000; 278: H1457-H1463PubMed Google Scholar) by reducing the Na+ loading that leads to excess Ca2+ loading. Because Cl−/HCO3− exchange can operate in concert with these acid extrusion mechanisms, thereby enhancing their activities, and has an opposite effect on pHi when operating alone, we analyzed the effect of the AE3 null mutation on I/R injury (Fig. 2). Using the Langendorff heart preparation, basal values of left ventricular developed pressure (107.0 ± 2.8 and 103.4 ± 2.8 mm Hg in AE3–/– and wild-type hearts, respectively) or left ventricular end diastolic pressure (7.3 ± 0.5 and 6.0 ± 0.5 mm Hg in AE3–/– and wild-type hearts, respectively) did not differ significantly between the two genotypes (n = 6 for each genotype). Following 30 min of ischemia, no significant differences were observed in either of these parameters between wild-type and AE3–/– hearts (Fig. 2). After 20–30 min of reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure (69.6 ± 2.8 and 64.6 ± 4.6 mm Hg in AE3–/– and wild-type hearts, respectively) and LVEDP (25.3 ± 2.9 and 27.4 ± 3.8 mm Hg in AE3–/– and wild-type hearts, respectively) were similar in both genotypes. Cardiovascular Performance Was Normal in AE3–/–Mice—Cardiovascular performance was measured in vivo using mice of both the original 129SvJ and Black Swiss mixed background and an FVB/N inbred background (Fig. 3). In response to β-adrenergic stimulation, the chronotropic effect was slightly higher in AE3–/– mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 3A); however, the differences were not significant, and there were no significant differences between the two genotypes with respect to mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and maximum dP/dt (Fig. 3, B–E). There were possible background differences in MAP, since the knock-out exhibited slightly elevated basal MAP on the mixed background (78.5 ± 6.3 and 71.6 ± 4.8 mm Hg in AE3–/– and wild-type mice, respectively) and reduced MAP on the FVB/N background (72.6 ± 4.1 and 79.2 ± 3.5 mm Hg in AE3–/– and wild-type mice, respectively). Corresponding differences were observed in basal systolic LVP, which is consistent with reduced afterload (lower basal MAP) in the FVB/N mice. Thus, dobutamine dose-response relationships for dP/dt40 were calculated for wild-type and AE3–/– mice on each background separately and combined (Fig. 3F). Because dP/dt40 is determined at a specific pressure and occurs before opening of the aortic valve, it serves as an index of contractility that provides a correction for possible differences in afterload (26Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar). Although there was a difference in basal dP/dt40 between the two mouse strains, with higher values in the FVB/N background than in the mixed 129SvJ and Black Swiss background (data not shown), there were no significant differences between wild-type and AE3–/– mice on either background, indicating that the loss of AE3 does not impair cardiac contractility. Impaired Cardiovascular Performance in AE3/NKCC1 Double Null Mutant Mice—When no major differences in cardiac function were observed between wild-type and AE3–/– mice, we considered the possibility that robust mechanisms for electrolyte homeostasis in the cardiac myocyte might mask the phenotypic consequences of AE3 ablation. NKCC1, operating alone, also provides a mechanism for Na+ and Cl– entry into the cardiac myocyte (36Frelin C. Chassande O. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Mihailidou A.S. Buhagiar K.A. Rasmussen H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C175-C181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and frequently contributes to the same physiological processes as Cl−/HCO3− exchange coupled with Na+-dependent acid extrusion (see “Discussion”). The loss of NKCC1 was shown previously to cause a reduction in blood pressure due to a vascular defect (20Meyer J.W. Flagella M. Sutliff R.L. Lorenz J.N. Nieman M.L. Weber C.S. Paul R.J. Shull G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1846-H1855PubMed Google Scholar); however, a deficit in cardiac function was not observed. Therefore, to impose a further deficit in Na+ and Cl– uptake that might exceed the compensatory mechanisms of the myocardium, we crossed the AE3 mutants with mice carrying a null mutation in NKCC1. The appearance and behavior of double null mice seemed identical to that of NKCC1-deficient mice (24Flagella M. Clarke L.L. Miller M.L. Erway L.C. Gianella R.A. Andringa A. Gawenis L.R. Kramer J. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Yamoah E.N. Cardell E.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26946-26955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar); the additional loss of AE3 caused no outwardly apparent changes in the NKCC1 phenotype. Heart weight/body weight ratios for AE3/NKCC1 null mice (5.22 ± 0.22 mg/g, n = 13) and wild-type mice (5.11 ± 0.26 mg/g, n = 11) were essentially the same (p = 0.74). In the closed chest model, there were no significant differences between wild-type and AE3/NKCC1 double null mice with respect to chronotropic effects or LVEDP (Fig. 4, A and D), but MAP and systolic LVP were significantly reduced in double knock-out mice at all levels of β-adrenergic stimulation (Fig. 4, B and C), as observed previously for the NKCC1 knock-out (20Meyer J.W. Flagella M. Sutliff R.L. Lorenz J.N. Nieman M.L. Weber C.S. Paul R.J. Shull G.E."
https://openalex.org/W2036873956,"Background Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory condition, which is characterized by acute, self-limiting episodes of fever and serositis and chronic subclinical inflammation in remission. Here we investigated the consequence of this condition on the level of systemic antibodies directed towards common intestinal bacteria. Methodology/Principal Findings The level of systemic antibodies towards the antigens of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Escherichia, Enteroccocus and Lactobaccilus was measured by ELISA in FMF patients at various stages of the disease and in healthy controls. The difference between remission and attack was not significant. IgG antibodies against the antigens of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Escherichia and Enteroccocus were significantly increased in FMF compared to control while IgA levels were not significantly affected. Western blot analyses demonstrated the IgG reactivity against multiple antigens of commensal bacteria in FMF. Serological expression cloning was performed to identify these antigens. No single dominant antigen was identified; the response was generalized and directed against a variety of proteins from Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Escherichia, and other gut commensals. Conclusions/Significance This autoinflammatory syndrome is characterized by the increased systemic reactivity against commensal gut microbiota. This is probably the consequence of hypersensitivity of the inflammasome in FMF that triggers the inflammation and contributes to the excessive translocation of bacteria and bacterial antigens through the gut barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2084520079,"Male songbirds learn their songs from an adult tutor when they are young. A network of brain nuclei known as the 'song system' is the likely neural substrate for sensorimotor learning and production of song, but the neural networks involved in processing the auditory feedback signals necessary for song learning and maintenance remain unknown. Determining which regions show preferential responsiveness to the bird's own song (BOS) is of great importance because neurons sensitive to self-generated vocalisations could mediate this auditory feedback process. Neurons in the song nuclei and in a secondary auditory area, the caudal medial mesopallium (CMM), show selective responses to the BOS. The aim of the present study is to investigate the emergence of BOS selectivity within the network of primary auditory sub-regions in the avian pallium.Using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, we investigated neural responsiveness to natural and manipulated self-generated vocalisations and compared the selectivity for BOS and conspecific song in different sub-regions of the thalamo-recipient area Field L. Zebra finch males were exposed to conspecific song, BOS and to synthetic variations on BOS that differed in spectro-temporal and/or modulation phase structure. We found significant differences in the strength of BOLD responses between regions L2a, L2b and CMM, but no inter-stimuli differences within regions. In particular, we have shown that the overall signal strength to song and synthetic variations thereof was different within two sub-regions of Field L2: zone L2a was significantly more activated compared to the adjacent sub-region L2b.Based on our results we suggest that unlike nuclei in the song system, sub-regions in the primary auditory pallium do not show selectivity for the BOS, but appear to show different levels of activity with exposure to any sound according to their place in the auditory processing stream."
https://openalex.org/W2085604236,"We studied the incidence of tuberculosis, AIDS, AIDS deaths and AIDS-TB co-infection at the population level in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where universal and free access to combination antiretroviral therapy has been available since 1997.This was a retrospective surveillance database match of Rio de Janeiro databases from 1995-2004. Proportions of tuberculosis occurring within 30 days and between 30 days and 1 year after AIDS diagnosis were determined. Generalized additive models fitted with cubic splines with appropriate estimating methods were used to describe rates and proportions over time. Overall, 90,806 tuberculosis cases and 16,891 AIDS cases were reported; 3,125 tuberculosis cases within 1 year of AIDS diagnosis were detected. Tuberculosis notification rates decreased after 1997 from a fitted rate (fR per 100,000) of 166.5 to 138.8 in 2004. AIDS incidence rates increased 26% between 1995 and 1998 (30.7 to 38.7) followed by a 33.3% decrease to 25.8 in 2004. AIDS mortality rates decreased dramatically after antiretroviral therapy was introduced between 1995 (27.5) and 1999 (13.4). The fitted proportion (fP) of patients with tuberculosis diagnosed within one year of AIDS decreased from 1995 (24.4%) to 1998 (15.2%), remaining stable since. Seventy-five percent of tuberculosis diagnoses after an AIDS diagnosis occurred within 30 days of AIDS diagnosis.Our results suggest that while combination ART should be considered an essential component of the response to the HIV and HIV/tuberculosis epidemics, it may not be sufficient alone to prevent progression from latent TB to active disease among HIV-infected populations. When tuberculosis is diagnosed prior to or at the same time as AIDS and ART has not yet been initiated, then ART is ineffective as a tuberculosis prevention strategy for these patients. Earlier HIV/AIDS diagnosis and ART initiation may reduce TB incidence in HIV/AIDS patients. More specific interventions will be required if HIV-related tuberculosis incidence is to continue to decline."
https://openalex.org/W2162474401,"It has been speculated that the polymorphisms in the non-coding portion of the human genome underlie much of the phenotypic variability among humans and between humans and other primates. If so, these genomic regions may be undergoing rapid evolutionary change, due in part to natural selection. However, the non-coding region is a heterogeneous mix of functional and non-functional regions. Furthermore, the functional regions are comprised of a variety of different types of elements, each under potentially different selection regimes.Using the HapMap and Perlegen polymorphism data that map to a stringent set of putative binding sites in human proximal promoters, we apply the Derived Allele Frequency distribution test of neutrality to provide evidence that many human-specific and primate-specific binding sites are likely evolving under positive selection. We also discuss inherent limitations of publicly available human SNP datasets that complicate the inference of selection pressures. Finally, we show that the genes whose proximal binding sites contain high frequency derived alleles are enriched for positive regulation of protein metabolism and developmental processes. Thus our genome-scale investigation provides evidence for positive selection on putative transcription factor binding sites in human proximal promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2054390592,"Control mechanisms of cellular metabolism and energetics in skeletal muscle that may become evident in response to physiological stresses such as reduction in blood flow and oxygen supply to mitochondria can be quantitatively understood using a multi-scale computational model. The analysis of dynamic responses from such a model can provide insights into mechanisms of metabolic regulation that may not be evident from experimental studies. For the purpose, a physiologically-based, multi-scale computational model of skeletal muscle cellular metabolism and energetics was developed to describe dynamic responses of key chemical species and reaction fluxes to muscle ischemia. The model, which incorporates key transport and metabolic processes and subcellular compartmentalization, is based on dynamic mass balances of 30 chemical species in both capillary blood and tissue cells (cytosol and mitochondria) domains. The reaction fluxes in cytosol and mitochondria are expressed in terms of a general phenomenological Michaelis-Menten equation involving the compartmentalized energy controller ratios ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD+. The unknown transport and reaction parameters in the model are estimated simultaneously by minimizing the differences between available in vivo experimental data on muscle ischemia and corresponding model outputs in coupled with the resting linear flux balance constraints using a robust, nonlinear, constrained-based, reduced gradient optimization algorithm. With the optimal parameter values, the model is able to simulate dynamic responses to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to mitochondria associated with muscle ischemia of several key metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes in the subcellular cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, some that can be measured and others that can not be measured with the current experimental techniques. The model can be applied to test complex hypotheses involving dynamic regulation of cellular metabolism and energetics in skeletal muscle during physiological stresses such as ischemia, hypoxia, and exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2018916450,"Photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is the central enzyme in the visual transduction cascade. The PDE6 catalytic subunit contains a catalytic domain and regulatory GAF domains. Unlike most GAF domain-containing cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, little is known about direct allosteric communication of PDE6. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time direct, inter-domain allosteric communication between the GAF and catalytic domains in PDE6. The binding affinity of PDE6 for pharmacological inhibitors or for the C-terminal region of the inhibitory γ subunit (Pγ), known to directly inhibit PDE6 catalysis, was increased ∼2-fold by ligands binding to the GAF domain. Binding of the N-terminal half of Pγ to the GAF domains suffices to induce this allosteric effect. Allosteric communication between GAF and catalytic domains is reciprocal, in that drug binding to the catalytic domain slowed cGMP dissociation from the GAF domain. Although cGMP hydrolysis was not affected by binding of Pγ1–60, Pγ lacking its last seven amino acids decreased the Michaelis constant of PDE6 by 2.5-fold. Pγ1–60 binding to the GAF domain increased vardenafil but not cGMP affinity, indicating that substrate- and inhibitor-binding sites do not totally overlap. In addition, prolonged incubation of PDE6 with vardenafil or sildenafil (but not 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and zaprinast) induced a distinct conformational change in the catalytic domain without affecting the binding properties of the GAF domains. We conclude that although Pγ-mediated regulation plays the dominant role in visual excitation, the direct, inter-domain allosteric regulation described in this study may play a feedback role in light adaptational processes during phototransduction.

Activated transducin then causes activation of PDE6, which results in rapid lowering of cGMP levels, closure of cGMP-gated ion channels, and hyperpolarization of the cell membrane (1Fain G.L.

Pugh Jr., E.N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5138-5152Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE6 must be precisely regulated to control the amplitude and kinetics of the photoresponse. Furthermore, each of these parameters undergoes additional modulation in response to ever-changing conditions of ambient illumination. The PDE6 holoenzyme consists of a catalytic dimer of α and β subunits (Pαβ) and two inhibitory γ subunits (Pγ) that are tightly bound to Pαβ. Transducin activation of PDE6 results from displacement of the inhibitory constraint of Pγ upon activated transducin binding to PDE6. The affinity of Pγ for the Pαβ catalytic dimer is also modulated in a reciprocal manner by noncatalytic cGMP binding to PDE6 at sites distinct from the catalytic site (Ref. 4Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L.

Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)). The GAF domains were originally named for their presence in cGMP-regulated PDEs, certain adenylyl cyclases, and the transcription factor Fh1A of bacteria (7Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The GAF domains of the vertebrate PDE members contain a functional cyclic nucleotide binding pocket. cGMP is the ligand for PDE2, PDE5, PDE6, and PDE11 (8Francis S.H. Lincoln T.M. Corbin J.D. J.

Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For PDE6, the noncatalytic cGMP-binding site has been localized to the N-terminal GAFa domain (14Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Artemyev N.O. Vision Res. 2004; 44: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Huang D. Hinds T.R. Martinez S.E. Doneanu C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48143-48151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A).Direct allosteric regulation of catalytic activity induced by binding of cyclic nucleotides to the GAF domains has been well documented for PDE2 and PDE5. For both PDE families, cGMP binding to the GAF domains induces a conformational change that relieves inhibition of catalysis in the active sites, causing stimulation of the enzyme (10Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yamamoto T. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding affinity of inhibitors to the catalytic domains of PDE5 is increased by cGMP addition (18Corbin J.D. Blount M.A. Weeks J.L. Beasley A. Kuhn K.P. Ho Y.S. Saidi L.F. Hurley J.H. Kotera J. Francis S.H. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As predicted, this allosteric regulation between the GAF and catalytic domains is reciprocal. For example, in PDE5, some inhibitors enhanced cGMP binding to the GAF domains (11Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Turko I.V. Ballard S.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to this direct allosteric communication between GAF and catalytic domains, it has been reported that PDE5 inhibitors can induce a conformational change in the catalytic domain that enhances inhibitor binding affinity in a time-dependent manner (21Blount M.A. Zoraghi R. Bessay E.P. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 323: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Based on the many similarities between PDE5 and PDE6 (22Cote R.H. Int. J. Impot. Res. 2004; 16: S28-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), direct, inter-domain allosteric communication between the GAF and catalytic domains is predicted for PDE6. However, previous work evaluating whether cGMP binding could influence the catalytic properties of PDE6 has not revealed a direct parallel to the allosteric control exerted on PDE5. For example, cGMP binding to the GAF domains fails to alter either the Km or kcat of the enzyme (4Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24501-24507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23D'Amours M.R. Cote R.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Instead, attention has focused on the allosteric control mediated by Pγ on both GAF and catalytic domains. The N-terminal region of Pγ (Fig. 1B) is known to interact with the GAF domains of the Pαβ catalytic dimer with a 50-fold higher affinity than the affinity of the C-terminal region of Pγ for the catalytic domain of Pαβ (24Mou H.

The C-terminal region of Pγ (Fig. 1B) is responsible for blocking the catalytic activity by binding to the catalytic domains of Pαβ (27Guo L.W. Grant J.E. Hajipour A.R. Muradov H. Arbabian M.

The ability of Pγ to interact with both GAF and catalytic domains of Pαβ serves to allosterically link the regulatory and catalytic domains of PDE6 in two ways as follows: 1) Pγ binding to the catalytic dimer enhances the binding affinity of cGMP to the GAF domain (32Yamazaki A. Bartucci F. Ting A. Bitensky M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3702-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); 2) cGMP occupancy of the GAF domain enhances Pγ affinity to Pαβ (4Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24501-24507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23D'Amours M.R. Cote R.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In this study, we first document that direct allosteric communication between the GAF domains and catalytic domains of PDE6 does indeed occur. Ligand binding to the GAF domains enhances the affinity of inhibitors and Pγ63–87 (i.e. amino acids 63–87 of the Pγ sequence) binding to the catalytic dimer. This inter-domain allosteric mechanism is reciprocal, in that inhibitor binding to catalytic domains increases the binding affinity of cGMP to the GAF domains. The magnitude of this direct allosteric regulation in PDE6 is comparable with that seen in PDE5, and it may play a role in modulating PDE6 activity during persistent activation of rod photoreceptors that occurs during normal daytime illumination conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Bovine retinas were purchased from W. L. Lawson, Inc. Synthetic peptide Pγ63–87 was purchased from New England Peptide. Vardenafil and sildenafil were provided by Bayer Healthcare AG. Ultima Gold scintillation fluid was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Filtration membranes were from Millipore, bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagents were from Pierce, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Stock solutions of PDE inhibitors were prepared in DMSO and diluted to less than 1% final concentration before use in assays.PDE6 and Pαβ Purification and Functional Assays—Bovine rod PDE6 was purified from bovine retinas as described (34Pentia D.C. Hosier S. Collupy R.A. Valeriani B.A. Cote R.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 307: 125-140PubMed Google Scholar). Pαβ catalytic dimers lacking Pγ were prepared by limited trypsin proteolysis and re-purified by gel filtration chromatography prior to use (34Pentia D.C. Hosier S. Collupy R.A. Valeriani B.A. Cote R.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 307: 125-140PubMed Google Scholar). PDE6 catalytic activity was measured in 20 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin either with a phosphate release microplate assay or with a radiotracer assay (35Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PDE6 concentration was estimated based on the rate of cGMP hydrolysis of trypsin-activated PDE6 and a knowledge of the kcat of the enzyme (5600 mol of cGMP hydrolyzed per Pαβ per s (36Mou H. Grazio H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)); this estimate was validated by determining stoichiometric binding of [3H]cGMP to PDE6 with a filter binding assay (37Cote R.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 307: 141-154PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition potency (IC50) of PDE5/6 inhibitors or Pγ63–87 was determined in the presence or absence of Pγ mutants using either 2 mm cGMP or 0.1 mm cAMP as substrates.Purification of Pγ and Pγ Mutants—Several Pγ truncation mutants (Fig. 1C) were generated from the full-length coding sequence using standard methods, introduced into the pET11a (Novagen) expression vector, and nucleotide sequences were verified. Recombinant Pγ and mutants (Pγ1–45, Pγ1–60, and Pγ1–80) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The bacterial extract was partially purified by cation exchange chromatography using SP-Sepharose, followed by C4 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (38Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods (San Diego). 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The purity (>95%) and size of these proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The inhibitory activity of Pγ was assessed by its ability to stoichiometrically inhibit Pαβ catalytic dimers (2 Pγ per Pαβ) (24Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (39Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard.Loading cGMP on the GAF Domains of Activated PDE6—Purified Pαβ was preincubated with 10 mm EDTA in binding buffer (100 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 22 °C to inhibit cGMP breakdown before addition of 1 μm [3H]cGMP and N-terminal region Pγ peptides (24Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The amount of cGMP bound to PDE6 under these conditions was verified to be 1.7–2.0 cGMP per Pαβ. The hydrolytic activity of PDE6 was restored by adding 10 mm MgCl2 immediately prior to assaying cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis. For experiments in which [3H]cGMP dissociation kinetics from Pαβ were measured in the absence of Pγ, purified Pαβ was preincubated for 2 h with 10 mm EDTA plus 20 mm dipicolinic acid to abolish residual catalytic activity (40He F. Seryshev A.B. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20572-20577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). (EDTA alone was unable to protect [3H]cGMP from breakdown by Pαβ (lacking Pγ peptides) during the binding assay.) Release of [3H]cGMP from Pαβ was monitored following addition of 1 mm unlabeled cGMP (containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm ZnSO4), and the time course of [3H]cGMP dissociation was monitored in the presence or absence of 100 μm vardenafil.Data Analysis—Dose-response experiments were analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis (Sigmaplot) to fit experimental data to a three-parameter logistic dose-response function: y = a/(1 + (x/x0)b), where a is the amplitude, b is the slope factor, and x0 is the IC50 (41Jungbauer A. Graumann K. J. Clin. Ligand Assay. 2001; 24: 270-274Google Scholar). For other experiments, curve-fitting models are described in the figure legends. Except where noted, all experiments were repeated at least three times. Tests of statistical significance for the curve fitting results used the Student's t test to calculate probability values, as indicated in the figure legends.RESULTSBinding of Ligands to the Regulatory GAF Domain Enhances the Ability of Vardenafil to Bind to the Catalytic Domain—Motivated by the analogy of PDE6 with other GAF-containing PDEs, we first explored whether ligand binding to the GAF domains could allosterically alter the properties of the active site of PDE6.Because both cGMP and the N-terminal region of Pγ are known to bind to the GAF domains of the PDE6 catalytic dimer (Pαβ; see Introduction and Fig. 1), we first examined whether the catalytic properties of PDE6 were altered upon binding of these ligands to the GAF domains. The first 60 amino acids of Pγ (Pγ1–60) lack the ability to inhibit catalysis (data not shown), and the primary sites of interaction are confined to the GAF domains (28Guo L.W. Muradov H. Hajipour A.R. Sievert M.K. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15412-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 42Song J. Guo L.W. Muradov H. Artemyev N.O. Ruoho A.E. Markley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We therefore used the truncated mutant Pγ1–60 to determine whether the binding affinity of vardenafil to the catalytic domain of Pαβ was altered when Pγ1–60 or Pγ1–60 plus cGMP were bound. To evaluate catalytic activity while simultaneously testing the effect of occupancy of the GAF domains, cAMP was used as a substrate for this experiment because it binds very poorly to the GAF domain even at high concentrations (12Hebert M.C. Schwede F. Jastorff B. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5557-5565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 demonstrates that the inhibitory potency of vardenafil was increased ∼2-fold (IC50 shifted from 4.3 ± 0.3 to 2.2 ± 0.2 nm) by Pγ1–60 binding to the GAF domain. Experiments using a shorter N-terminal fragment of Pγ (Pγ1–45) showed the same 2-fold enhancement of vardenafil binding as were seen with Pγ1–60 (data not shown), confirming that the GAF-interacting region of Pγ (localized to amino acid residues 18–45 (24Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) was responsible for this inter-domain allosterism observed in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Pγ1–60 binding to the PDE6 GAF domains enhanced vardenafil binding affinity to the catalytic sites. Purified Pαβ (2 nm) was preincubated with 10 mm EDTA for 2 h to inhibit PDE activity, followed by incubation with 1 μm cGMP and 2 μm Pγ1–60 (•), 2 μm Pγ1–60 only (□), or no addition (▴). 10 mm Mg2+ was then added to restore catalytic activity, and the inhibitory potency of vardenafil was measured using 0.1 mm cAMP as substrate with the radiotracer assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). cGMP binding assays confirmed retention of bound cGMP during the experiment. The data are the mean (±S.E.) of five experiments. The solid lines represent the fit to a three-parameter logistic dose-response equation with IC50 values of 4.3 ± 0.3 nm (no addition), 2.2 ± 0.2 nm (Pγ1–60), and 2.3 ± 0.1 nm (Pγ1–60 plus cGMP). The asterisks indicate that the IC50 value was statistically significant (p < 0.05) from the control value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inclusion of cGMP with Pγ1–60 so as to occupy the GAFa cGMP binding pocket failed to further enhance the allosteric effect on vardenafil binding to the Pαβ active site (Fig. 2). (Unfortunately, we were unable to directly measure the allosteric effects of cGMP binding in the absence of the Pγ N-terminal region, because the high catalytic rate of Pαβ led to hydrolysis of cGMP unless GAF-interacting Pγ peptides were present to stabilize cGMP binding to the GAFa domain.) It is possible that either Pγ binding to the GAF domain or cGMP occupancy of the GAFa binding pocket induce the same conformational change in the GAF domains that is transmitted to the catalytic domain.Binding of the N-terminal Region of Pγ to the GAF Domains Enhances the Binding Affinity of Pγ63–87 to the Catalytic Domain—The C-terminal region of Pγ inhibits PDE6 catalysis by interacting with amino acid residues lining the entrance to the catalytic pocket (43Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); these residues are predicted to be distant from those stabilizing vardenafil binding to the active site (44Card G.L. England B.P. Suzuki Y. Fong D. Powell B. Lee B. Luu C. Tabrizizad M. Gillette S. Ibrahim P.N. Artis D.R. Bollag G. Milburn M.V. Kim S.H. Schlessinger J. Zhang K.Y. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 2233-2247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, we questioned whether binding of the N-terminal region of Pγ to the GAF domains could alter the binding affinity of the C-terminal region of Pγ to the catalytic domains of Pαβ. Fig. 3 shows that the dose-response curve for Pγ63–87 inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis was shifted about 2-fold when Pγ1–45 or Pγ1–60 was bound to the GAF domains. The finding that both vardenafil and Pγ63–87 affinity were increased ∼2-fold when the N-terminal half of Pγ bound to the PDE6 GAF domains indicates that this inter-domain allosteric change is likely to affect the global conformation of the PDE6 catalytic domain.FIGURE 3Binding of Pγ1–45 or Pγ1–60 to the GAF domains equally enhanced the binding affinity of Pγ63–87 to the catalytic domain. Purified Pαβ (0.2 nm) was preincubated with 2 μm Pγ1–45 (□), 2 μm Pγ1–60 (•), or no peptide (▴) for 10 min before adding increasing amounts of Pγ63–87. The PDE activity was measured using 2 mm cGMP as substrate. The data represent the average of four experiments, and curve fitting (solid line) yielded the following IC50 values: 2.2 ± 0.1 μm (no added peptide); 1.2 ± 0.1 μm (Pγ1–45); and 1.5 ± 0.2 μm (Pγ1–60). The asterisks indicate that the IC50 value was statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) from the control value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Conformational Changes in Substrate Affinity to the Active Site Require Pγ Interactions with the Catalytic Domain, Not the GAF Domains—These novel allosteric effects of Pγ on vardenafil and Pγ63–87 binding to PDE6 differ from earlier work in which cGMP and/or Pγ1–45 binding to the GAF domains failed to allosterically alter the kinetic parameters for substrate hydrolysis of the Pαβ active site (4Arshavsky V.Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This is unexpected, because cGMP and vardenafil are likely to share some interaction sites within the catalytic pocket, as judged by comparison of crystal structures of PDE5 complexed with 5′-GMP and vardenafil (44Card G.L. England B.P. Suzuki Y. Fong D. Powell B. Lee B. Luu C. Tabrizizad M. Gillette S. Ibrahim P.N. Artis D.R. Bollag G. Milburn M.V. Kim S.H. Schlessinger J. Zhang K.Y.

To examine this more closely, we measured the Michaelis constant (Km) for cGMP in the presence of two Pγ truncation mutants, Pγ1–60 and Pγ1–80. Pγ1–60 was chosen because it cannot inhibit catalysis, and its primary sites of interaction with Pαβ are within the GAF domain, whereas Pγ1–80 partially inhibits catalysis (∼60% reduction in Vmax; see Ref. 30Skiba N.P.

Whereas Pγ1–60 failed to affect the Km (or Vmax) value for cGMP hydrolysis (Fig. 4) (consistent with previous work with Pγ1–45 (24Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), binding of Pγ1–80 to Pαβ increased the Km value for cGMP from 9 ± 0.9 to 23 ± 1.5 μm (Fig. 4). The differences in how cGMP (Fig. 4) and vardenafil (Fig. 2) are affected by Pγ binding to Pαβ may reflect a local conformational change within the catalytic domain upon binding amino acids 61–80 of Pγ that is distinct from the inter-domain communication between the GAF and catalytic domains that is induced by the GAF-interacting region of Pγ.FIGURE 4Pγ1–80 increased the Michaelis-Menten constant of PDE6. Purified Pαβ (20 pm) was preincubated with 200 nm Pγ1–60 (⋄), 200 nm Pγ1–80 (▴) or no peptide (•) for 20 min before addition of increasing amounts of cGMP. The data represent the average of three experiments (except Pγ1–60 where n = 2) and were fit to a two-parameter hyperbolic function with the following parameters: no peptides, Km = 9.1 ± 0.6 μm and Vmax = 6.2 ± 0.1 pmol cGMP/s; Pγ1–60, Km = 9.5 ± 0.9 μm, Vmax = 6.1 ± 0.1 pmol cGMP/s; and Pγ1–80, Km = 22.9 ± 1.5 μm, Vmax = 2.4 ± 0.05 pmol cGMP/s. The asterisk indicates that the Km value for Pγ1–80 was statistically significant (p < 0.05) from the control and Pγ1–60 values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding of Vardenafil to the Catalytic Domains Enhanced cGMP Binding to the GAF Domains—Having established in the previous sections the direct allosteric regulation by the GAF domains on the catalytic domain of PDE6, the principle of allosteric linkage (46Wyman J.

https://openalex.org/W2066950135,"We have previously reported that EFA6, exchange factor for Arf6, is implicated upon E-cadherin engagement in the process of epithelial cell polarization. We had found that EFA6 acts through stabilization of the apical actin ring onto which the tight junction is anchored. Mutagenesis experiments showed that both the catalytic domain of EFA6 and its C-terminal domain were required for full EFA6 function. Here we address the contribution of the specific substrate of EFA6, the small G protein Arf6. Unexpectedly, depletion of Arf6 by RNA interference or expression of the constitutively active fast-cycling mutant (Arf6T157N) revealed that Arf6 plays an opposing role to EFA6 by destabilizing the apical actin cytoskeleton and the associated tight junction. However, in complementation experiments, when the C-terminal domain of EFA6 is co-expressed with Arf6T157N, it reverts the effects of Arf6T157N expressed alone to faithfully mimic the phenotypes induced by EFA6. In addition, we find that the two signaling pathways downstream of EFA6, i.e. the one originating from the activated Arf6GTP and the other one from the EFA6 C-terminal domain, need to be tightly balanced to promote the proper reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Altogether, our results indicate that to regulate the tight junction, EFA6 activates Arf6 through its Sec7 catalytic domain as it modulates this activity through its C-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W2006915645,"Background Co-occurrence analysis is a technique often applied in text mining, comparative genomics, and promoter analysis. The methodologies and statistical models used to evaluate the significance of association between co-occurring entities are quite diverse, however. Methodology/Principal Findings We present a general framework for co-occurrence analysis based on a bipartite graph representation of the data, a novel co-occurrence statistic, and software performing co-occurrence analysis as well as generation and analysis of co-occurrence networks. We show that the overall stringency of co-occurrence analysis depends critically on the choice of the null-model used to evaluate the significance of co-occurrence and find that random sampling from a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph permits co-occurrence analysis with optimal stringency. We show that the Poisson-binomial distribution is the most natural co-occurrence probability distribution when vertex degrees of the bipartite graph are variable, which is usually the case. Calculation of Poisson-binomial P-values is difficult, however. Therefore, we propose a fast bi-binomial approximation for calculation of P-values and show that this statistic is superior to other measures of association such as the Jaccard coefficient and the uncertainty coefficient. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis of more than two entities can be performed using the same statistical model, which leads to increased signal-to-noise ratios, robustness towards noise, and the identification of implicit relationships between co-occurring entities. Using NetCutter, we identify a novel protein biosynthesis related set of genes that are frequently coordinately deregulated in human cancer related gene expression studies. NetCutter is available at http://bio.ifom-ieo-campus.it/NetCutter/). Conclusion Our approach can be applied to any set of categorical data where co-occurrence analysis might reveal functional relationships such as clinical parameters associated with cancer subtypes or SNPs associated with disease phenotypes. The stringency of our approach is expected to offer an advantage in a variety of applications."
https://openalex.org/W2031712450,"Tumor cells evade adaptive immunity by a variety of mechanisms, including selection of variants that are resistant to specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) pressure. Recently, we have reported that the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton can be used by tumor cells as a strategy to promote their resistance to CTL-mediated lysis. In this study, we further examined the functional features of a CTL-resistant tumor variant and investigated the relationship between cytoskeleton alteration, the acquisition of tumor resistance to CTL-induced cell death, Rho-GTPases, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathways. Our data indicate that although the resistant cells do not display an increased migratory potential, an alteration of adhesion to the extracellular matrix was observed. When Rho-GTPases were activated in cells by the bacterial CNF1 (cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1), striking changes in the cell morphology, including actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and membrane extensions, were observed. More importantly, such activation also resulted in a significant attenuation of resistance to CTL-induced cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FAK signaling pathways were constitutively defective in the resistant cells. Silencing of FAK in the sensitive target cells resulted in the inhibition of immune synapse formation with specific CTLs and their subsequent lysis. Expression of the FAK mutant (Y397F) resulted in an inhibition of IGR-Heu cell adhesion and of their susceptibility to specific lysis.

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) 3The abbreviations used are: CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 3The abbreviations used are: CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are important effector cells in tumor rejection and have been described to play a crucial role in host defense against malignancies in both mouse and human (1Smyth M.J. Godfrey D.I. Trapani J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). It has been reported that although tumor-specific T cell responses prevent tumor cell growth, they may also select resistant variants in vivo, such as tumor antigen-negative variants (2Dunn G.P. Bruce A.T. Ikeda H. Old L.J. Schreiber R.D. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (3455) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that tumor cells play a crucial role in the control of immune protection (3Chouaib S. Asselin-Paturel C. Mami-Chouaib F. Caignard A. Blay J.Y. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 493-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and possess many overlapping mechanisms to maintain their functional disorder and evasion. In this regard, it has been suggested that tumor cell growth in vivo is not only influenced by CTL-tumor cell recognition but also by tumor susceptibility to cell-mediated death. Several mechanisms have been associated with the acquisition of tumor resistance to cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Recently, we have identified an additional mechanism that involved alteration of tumor cell actin cytoskeleton (4Abouzahr S. Bismuth G. Gaudin C. Caroll O. Van Endert P. Jalil A. Dausset J. Vergnon I. Richon C. Kauffmann A. Galon J. Raposo G. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), confirming that changes in the expression of specific structural components of the actin cytoskeleton can affect tumor susceptibility to cytotoxic treatments (5Verrills N.M. Po'uha S.T. Liu M.L. Liaw T.Y. Larsen M.R. Ivery M.T. Marshall G.M. Gunning P.W. Kavallaris M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and that the cytoskeleton plays a critical role in various cellular processes. In this respect, it can no longer be considered as only a structural framework playing a role in cell shape, adhesion, motility, exocytosis, and endocytosis. It is well established that cytoskeleton-dependent activities are governed by Rho-GTPases, a family of regulatory molecules composed of three different subfamilies, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, that coordinate multiple signaling pathways and the transcription of specific target genes. Rho proteins act to fine-tune the cell, reshaping it during cell polarization, movement, differentiation, and phagocytosis (6Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar, 7Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are integrin-mediated points of contact between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Coordinated assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions as well as intracellular signaling from these sites modulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival in response to different stimuli (8Bershadsky A.D. Balaban N.Q. Geiger B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 9Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). FAK (gene name ptk2) is a central node in the signaling network emanating from focal adhesions (10Mitra S.K. Hanson D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). This protein is recruited to sites of integrin clustering via interactions of its C-terminal domain with integrin-associated proteins. Although the precise mechanisms by which cell-surface receptors, such as integrins, initiate FAK activation are not very well understood, evidence has been provided indicating that integrin or growth factor activation induces FAK to autophosphorylate on Tyr-397 (11Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on Tyr-397 creates a binding site for Src kinases (26Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The resulting activated FAK-Src complex phosphorylates other FAK tyrosine residues (26Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and substrates, including paxillin (12Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J.

Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). Despite the recent advances in the understanding of the complex interplay between GTPases and FAK as well as their potential role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, their putative implication in the regulation of the anti-tumor cytotoxic response remains unknown. Our results suggest that besides actin content (4Abouzahr S. Bismuth G. Gaudin C. Caroll O. Van Endert P. Jalil A. Dausset J. Vergnon I. Richon C. Kauffmann A. Galon J. Raposo G. Mami-Chouaib F.

A. 2006; 103: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that might act as a molecular switch in the control of tumor susceptibility to CTL killing, the activation of FAK may orchestrate a dynamic cross-talk between actin filaments and signaling pathways that play a key role in the control of tumor target sensitivity to CTL-induced cell death. Toxins—Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) from Escherichia coli was used as a GST fusion protein and purified as described previously (14Moreau V. Tatin F. Varon C. Genot E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6809-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After dialysis against PBS, CNF1 purification was checked by SDS-PAGE. Tumor Cell Lines and CTL Clone—The non-small cell lung carcinoma tumor cell line, IGR-Heu, was derived from a large-cell carcinoma of the lung, as described (15Echchakir H. Asselin-Paturel C. Dorothee G. Vergnon I. Grunenwald D. Chouaib S. Mami-Chouaib F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% Ultroser G (Invitrogen), 1% sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). The Heu161 CTL clone was isolated from autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, as described (15Echchakir H. Asselin-Paturel C. Dorothee G. Vergnon I. Grunenwald D. Chouaib S. Mami-Chouaib F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The resistant cell line to CTL lysis, IGR-HeuR, was derived from IGR-Heu and was established after 3 months of co-culture with the autologous CTLs. The cell line was then cloned by limiting dilution, and several clones, including IGR-HeuR8, were isolated (4Abouzahr S. Bismuth G. Gaudin C. Caroll O. Van Endert P. Jalil A. Dausset J. Vergnon I. Richon C. Kauffmann A. Galon J. Raposo G. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs and Cell Transfections—The cDNAs encoding the FAK mutants (Y397F and Y925F) in the pcDNA3 expression vector were kindly provided by Dr. K. Yamada (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). In total, 106 cells were plated in 10-cm2 dishes. Transient transfection was carried out the next day using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and 4 μg of plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h later, the cells were used in experiments. RNA Interference—Gene silencing of FAK expression was performed using sequence-specific siRNA (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Briefly, cells were transfected by electroporation with 50 nm of short interfering RNA in a Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation System (Bio-Rad, 300 V, 500 microfarads) and then allowed to grow for 72 h. An siRNA targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein was used as a negative control (5′-GCAAGCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAU-3′). All sequences were evaluated for gene specificity using the Blast Program from the National Institutes of Health. Cytolytic Activity Assay—As described previously (16Asselin-Paturel C. Megherat S. Vergnon I. Echchakir H. Dorothee G. Blesson S. Gay F. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. Cancer. 2001; 91: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the cytotoxic activity of the CTL clone was measured by a conventional 4-h 51Cr-release assay by using triplicate cultures in round-bottomed 96-well plates. The percentage of specific cytotoxicity was calculated conventionally. Pulldown Assay and Immunoblotting—Briefly, cells were scraped, chilled on ice, and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg·ml-1 aprotinin, 1 μg·ml-1 leupeptin, and 1 μg·ml-1 pepstatin. Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 × g. Active (GTP-bound) forms of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 were captured by pulldown assay and quantified by Western blotting of the precipitated material, as described previously (17Haddad E. Zugaza J.L. Louache F. Debili N. Crouin C. Schwarz K. Fischer A. Vainchenker W. Bertoglio J. Blood. 2001; 97: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Rho-GTP was captured using GST-Rho binding domain rhotekin; Rac-GTP and Cdc42-GTP were both captured using GST-Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain (CRIB) PAK. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer (containing 150 mm NaCl) and boiled in 25 μl of SDS-PAGE lysis buffer containing reducing agents. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted. Activated Rho-GTPases were revealed by immunoblotting using specific anti-Rac and anti-Cdc42 antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories) and an anti-RhoA antibody described previously by Lang et al. (18Lang P. Gesbert F. Thiberge J.M. Troalen F. Dutartre H. Chavrier P. Bertoglio J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1522-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The labeling was visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Western Blotting—Adherent tumor cells were washed in PBS and then solubilized on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μm leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin, 25 μm aprotinin, 50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After centrifugation, lysates (50 μg per lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation in blocking buffer, the membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000; Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-phospho-FAK (diluted 1:500; Upstate Biotechnologies). The labeling was visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Cell Adhesion Assay—Cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins was quantified by plating cells on fibronectin (Sigma), Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences), and type I and IV collagens (BD Biosciences). Nunc Immuno-Plate MaxiSorp™ plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin, 3 μg/ml collagen I or collagen IV overnight at 4 °C, and 0.3 mg/ml Matrigel™ for 20 min at 37 °C, then blocked with DMEM/F-12 + 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C, and washed with PBS. At 80–90% confluency, tumor cells were harvested with 0.1 mm EDTA, and 4 × 104 cells/well were seeded in serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium for 5–90 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by gentle washing of the wells twice with PBS. Remaining attached cells were quantified by adding 100 μl of culture medium and 50 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (0.25 mg/ml) as described previously (19Meslin F. Hamai A. Gao P. Jalil A. Cahuzac N. Chouaib S. Mehrpour M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10910-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Tumor cells alone or co-cultured with autologous CTL at a 1:2 target/effector ratio were plated on glass coverslips or poly-l-lysine slides (Sigma) (for conjugate formation study), fixed with 3% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 20 min. The fixed cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for actin staining and/or with an anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma) followed by Alexa-488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Coverslips or poly-l-lysine slides (Sigma) were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed the following day by a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510, Jena, Germany). Z-projection of slices was performed using LSM Image Examiner software (Zeiss). Resistance to CTL-mediated Lysis Is Associated with a Major Cell Adhesion Defect to the Extracellular Matrix Compounds—The human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line IGR-Heu and the autologous CTL clone Heu161 (CD3+, CD8+, CD4-, and CD28-) were described previously (15Echchakir H. Asselin-Paturel C. Dorothee G. Vergnon I. Grunenwald D. Chouaib S. Mami-Chouaib F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, Heu161 displays a strong cytotoxic activity against IGR-Heu autologous cells and only a weak activity toward its derivative IGR-HeuR8-resistant variant cells. To investigate the possible relationship between the acquisition of resistance to CTL-mediated cytotoxicity and the cell adhesion capacity, adhesion assays to extracellular matrix compounds were performed. As shown in Fig. 1B, IGR-HeuR8-resistant cells displayed a reduced adhesion to type I and IV collagens as well as to Matrigel™. Adhesion of IGR-Heu cells to fibronectin was very weak and abolished for IGR-HeuR8. To determine whether the defect in IGR-HeuR8 cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix was associated with differences in the surface expression of adhesion molecules, the expression of the integrin subunit β1, a known receptor for collagen I and IV (20Kramer R.H. Marks N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4684-4688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the various extracellular matrix integrin receptors αvβ6, αvβ5, and αvβ3 was investigated. No difference in the integrin repertoire between IGR-Heu and IGR-HeuR8 cells was observed (data not shown), suggesting that a defect in integrin downstream signaling pathways may contribute to IGR-HeuR8 cell adhesion defect rather than differences in integrin expression levels. Activation of Rho-GTPases Induces Morphological Changes in IGR-HeuR8-resistant Cells and Increases Their Adhesion to Type I and IV Collagens—Integrins are receptors that mediate dynamic linkage between extracellular matrix molecules and the actin cytoskeleton (21Brakebusch C. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2324-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The profound reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton observed in IGR-HeuR8 cells (4Abouzahr S. Bismuth G. Gaudin C. Caroll O. Van Endert P. Jalil A. Dausset J. Vergnon I. Richon C. Kauffmann A. Galon J. Raposo G. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that proteins implicated in the actin cytoskeleton dynamics could be involved in the IGR-HeuR8 cell adhesion defect. Accumulating evidence points to the notion that actin cytoskeleton dynamics is regulated by a complex interplay of the small GTPase proteins Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 (9Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the alteration in cytoskeleton organization in IGR-HeuR8 cells resulted from a deregulation of the activity of small GTP-binding proteins. We focused on the Rho family in particular, because these regulatory molecules are involved in the control of the actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics (22Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional role of Rho-dependent pathways in cell adhesion, cells were treated with the CNF1 (cytotoxic necrotizing factor1), a bacterial toxin that is able to directly activate the Rho-GTPases (23Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 24Lerm M. Selzer J. Hoffmeyer A. Rapp U.R. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 496-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The activated (GTP-bound) form of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 was assessed by a GST pulldown experiment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2A, CNF1 treatment of IGR-Heu and IGR-HeuR8 cells similarly increased the activated form of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. In addition, the results shown in this figure indicate a significant and selective Rac1 degradation in CNF1-treated IGR-Heu sensitive cells. Given the ability of Rho-GTPases to control the actin cytoskeleton organization, we asked whether the modulation of these regulatory proteins by CNF1 could restore actin organization in IGR-HeuR8. As shown in Fig. 2B, CNF1 induced morphological changes of IGR-HeuR8 from round to spread cells, which were accompanied by important actin cytoskeleton enrichment and the formation of several adhesive contacts. Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-vinculin antibody clearly demonstrated that IGR-HeuR8 cells lack the adhesion contacts corresponding to focal adhesions that are observed in IGR-Heu cells. CNF1 treatment did not have any impact on IGR-HeuN morphology. The morphological changes observed in IGR-HeuR8 cells upon CNF1 treatment were dependent on Rho-GTPases as treatment of the cells with C3 exoenzyme, a known inhibitor of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC proteins, suppressed this effect (Fig. 2C). Although C3 induced an alteration of IGR-Heu morphology (cytosol retraction and long protrusions), it had no effect on IGR-Heu cells in the presence of CNF1. We next investigated whether Rho-GTPase activation was able to restore IGR-HeuR8 cell adhesion defects. As shown in Fig. 2D, whereas treatment of IGR-HeuR8 cells with CNF1 resulted in an increase in cell adhesion to the type I and type IV collagens, the defect of cell adhesion to fibronectin and Matrigel™ remained unaffected. Activation of Rho-GTPases Attenuates IGR-Heu Resistance to CTL-mediated Cytotoxicity—Based on the assumption that such a morphological remodeling observed following CNF1 exposure could have a consequence on tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis, we performed a cytotoxic assay using CNF1-treated IGR-HeuR8 cells. For this purpose, target cells exposed to the CNF1 toxin for 2 or 18 h were tested for their susceptibility to killing by the CTL clone. As shown in Fig. 3, whereas no effect was observed after 2 h of IGR-HeuR8 incubation with CNF1, a significant increase in IGR-HeuR8 killing was observed following 18 h of incubation. These results provide evidence that activation of Rho-GTPases is sufficient to partially restore CTL-mediated cytotoxicity of IGR-HeuR8 cells. Tumor Cell Resistance to CTL-mediated Lysis Correlates with a FAK Activation Default—FAK plays a prominent role in multiple aspects of cell adhesion processes. It has been suggested that FAK is a critical protein, which participates in several cell adhesion signaling pathways to coordinate appropriate biological responses (26Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Because the activation of Rho-GTPases induced the formation of focal contacts in IGR-HeuR8 cells, we compared the expression level and the phosphorylation status of FAK in sensitive IGR-Heu and its derivative-resistant IGR-HeuR8 cells untreated or treated with CNF1. Data shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the expression level of FAK was similar in both cell types. Next, using anti-phospho-FAK specific antibodies, we analyzed the phosphorylation of Tyr-397 and Tyr-925, two main tyrosines known to be phosphorylated during FAK activation (26Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397 and Tyr-925 was strongly decreased in IGR-HeuR8 cells compared with IGR-Heu cells. Treatment of IGR-HeuR8 during 6, 12, and 18 h with CNF1 induced an increase in the phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-925 and Tyr-397 in these cells. This result demonstrates that the constitutive level of activated FAK was significantly reduced in IGR-HeuR8 compared with its level in the sensitive cells IGR-Heu. It also strongly suggests that the phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-397 and Tyr-925 may play a role in the control of tumoral cell resistance to CTL-mediated lysis. Involvement of FAK in the Control of Specific Tumor Target Lysis—To further explore the role of FAK in regulating target cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis, we inhibited its expression in IGR-Heu cells using two different specific siRNAs designed to target FAK. As shown in Fig. 5A, both siRNA were able to completely abolish the expression of FAK in IGR-Heu cells compared with control green fluorescent protein siRNA. The ability of control cells and FAK-siRNA-transfected cells to form the immunological synapse with autologous CTL was next analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5B, silencing of FAK in IGR-Heu cells dramatically suppressed the formation of immunological synapse with Heu161 CTL. The few synapses formed are characterized by a slight actin accumulation in the synaptic contact that was reminiscent of those formed by IGR-HeuR8 (4Abouzahr S. Bismuth G. Gaudin C. Caroll O. Van Endert P. Jalil A. Dausset J. Vergnon I. Richon C. Kauffmann A. Galon J. Raposo G. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We next examined the ability of CTL to kill IGR-Heu cells transfected with control and FAK-siRNA. The results shown in Fig. 5C clearly indicate a remarkable decrease (50%) in the susceptibility of FAK-siRNA-transfected IGR-Heu cells to CTL-mediated lysis. It points to a role of FAK in the regulation of tumoral susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis. Expression of FAK Mutant (Y397F) in IGR-Heu-sensitive Cells Decreases Their Adhesion and Susceptibility to CTL-induced Cell Death—To examine the role of tyrosine phosphorylation on residues Tyr-397 and Tyr-925 of FAK in the control of IGR-Heu cell adhesion and susceptibility to lysis, we studied the cellular effects of the overexpression of two different FAK mutants, Y397F and Y925F. IGR-Heu cells were transfected with these mutants as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 6A, the expression of FAK-Y397F and FAK-Y925F decreased the phosphorylation level of FAK, respectively, in Tyr-397 and Tyr-925 in transfected IGR-Heu cells. Investigation of the adhesion potential of IGR-Heu cells revealed a significant and time-dependent increased level of cell adhesion to fibronectin, collagen I, collagen IV, and Matrigel™, whereas IGR-HeuR8 cells displayed only a slight adhesion increase. Interestingly, Y397F mutant FAK significantly inhibited cell adhesion at all times tested compared with nontransfected control cells and resulted in an adhesion level comparable with the one observed with IGR-HeuR8 cells. In contrast, no apparent differences in cell adhesion to the various extracellular matrix proteins or to Matrigel™ were observed in Y925F mutant-transfected IGR-Heu cells. To examine the role of Y397F and Y925F mutants of FAK in the control of IGR-Heu cell susceptibility to the autologous CTL clone Heu-161, the lysis of FAK mutant-transfected cells was tested. As shown in Fig. 6B, a significant decreased lysis (50% inhibition) in Y397F-FAK-transfected IGR-Heu cells was observed, whereas no effect was detected in cells expressing the FAK-Y925F mutant. This suggests a critical role of Tyr-397 in FAK-associated regulation of IGR-Heu adhesion and susceptibility to specific lysis. The ability of cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and resist immunotherapy raises a fundamental question of how tumor cells survive in the presence of a competent immune system. Studies to address this question have primarily focused on mechanisms by which tumor cells avoid recognition by or induce tolerance in the immune system. However, little is known about the possibility that cancer cells might also acquire an intrinsic ability to resist to killing by immune effectors. We have recently reported that cancer cells enhance their ability to withstand an attack by cytotoxic immune effector cells via cytoskeleton remodeling (4Abouzahr S. Bismuth G. Gaudin C. Caroll O. Van Endert P. Jalil A. Dausset J. Vergnon I. Richon C. Kauffmann A. Galon J. Raposo G. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This further suggests that immunoediting of tumors results in cellular reprogramming that may be accompanied by alterations in tumor characteristics, including morphological changes. Here we investigated the putative signaling pathways that may be associated with the resistance phenotype and assigned a new role for FAK in the cross-talk between killer cells and their targets. Several studies on actin-associated proteins demonstrate that changes in the expression of specific structural component of the actin cytoskeleton can contribute to tumorigenesis (27Janke J. Schluter K. Jandrig B. Theile M. Kolble K. Arnold W. Grinstein E. Schwartz A. Estevez-Schwarz L. Schlag P.M. Jockusch B.M. Scherneck S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1675-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the acquisition of tumor resistance to CTL-induced cell death and the subsequent remodeling of the cytoskeleton were not accompanied with an in vitro increased migratory potential (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that such resistance correlates with a major adhesion defect to extracellular matrix compounds independently of integrin expression and β1 functionality. Indeed, blocking β1 integrin had no effect on tumoral susceptibility to lysis, ruling out its involvement in the tumor resistance to CTLs (data not shown). It is well established that actin dynamics is regulated by a complex interplay of the small GTPase proteins Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 (28Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), coordinating multiple signaling pathways and transcription of specific target genes. In this respect, we investigated in our model the possible implication of Rho family proteins (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) controlling the actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics. For this purpose, we used CNF1, a toxin activating Rho-GTPases (23Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 24Lerm M. Selzer J. Hoffmeyer A. Rapp U.R. Aktories K. Schmidt G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 496-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We could demonstrate that such a compound increased the level of polymerized actin and the formation of focal adhesions in the resistant variant clone. This is consistent with data from other previous reports using distinct cellular models (29Lacerda H.M. Pullinger G.D. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9587-9596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrated that CNF1 treatment of resistant IGR-HeuR8 restored the parental morphology and attenuated the cell resistance to CTL-mediated killing. This confirms the multifunctional role of the Rho family and suggests that GTPases are not affecting only the morphological events but may interfere with the survival phenotype and the subsequent target killing by CTLs. FAK is an important tyrosine kinase that regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and modulates cell adhesion and proliferation. Using Western blot analysis, we could demonstrate that the acquisition of tumor cell resistance resulted in a defect in the constitutive FAK activation in the tumor-resistant variant IGR-HeuR8. Such a defect could result from the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton as previously shown by Schaller and Parsons (30Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that expression of Rnd3 (RhoE) protein, which counteracts Rho signaling, interferes with actin cytoskeletal organization and focal adhesion turnover (31Klein R.M. Spofford L.S. Abel E.V. Ortiz A. Aplin A.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), reinforcing the hypothesis of a Rho deregulation as a possible mechanism associated with an altered FAK activation. Given the involvement of Eph/Ephrin family of proteins in the regulation of FAK activity and expression and because EphrinA1 was found to be overexpressed in the resistant variant (4Abouzahr S. Bismuth G. Gaudin C. Caroll O. Van Endert P. Jalil A. Dausset J. Vergnon I. Richon C. Kauffmann A. Galon J. Raposo G. Mami-Chouaib F. Chouaib S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it remains undetermined whether it may serve as a critical negative regulator of FAK in our experimental system. In the course of these studies, we found that CNF1 treatment of the IGR-HeuR8 variant resulted in the phosphorylation of FAK at residues Tyr-397 and Tyr-925. The relationship between Rho-GTPases activation and FAK phosphorylation in the regulation of tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis remains to be determined. With this respect, it has been reported by Subauste et al. (33Subauste M.C. Von Herrath M. Benard V. Chamberlain C.E. Chuang T.H. Chu K. Bokoch G.M. Hahn K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9725-9733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) that Rho-GTPases are implicated in the regulation of Fas-mediated lysis. It should also be noted that evidence has been provided indicating the existence of an interdependent regulation of FAK and Rho-GTPases (34Holinstat M. Knezevic N. Broman M. Samarel A.M. Malik A.B. Mehta D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2296-2305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 35Chang F. Lemmon C.A. Park D. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although FAK was mainly implicated in vitro and in vivo in apoptosis, angiogenesis, migration, cytoskeleton remodeling, and tumorigenesis (36Wozniak M.A. Modzelewska K. Kwong L. Keely P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 37McLean G.W. Carragher N.O. Avizienyte E. Evans J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), its role in the regulation of tumor cell response to CTLs is not well documented. Nevertheless, FAK-mediated down-modulation of ICAM-1 expression on tumor cells and its inhibition of synapse formation and subsequent target lysis have been reported (38Yasuda M. Tanaka Y. Tamura M. Fujii K. Sugaya M. So T. Takenoyama M. Yasumoto K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2022-2030PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that suppression of FAK expression in sensitive tumor cells impaired conjugate formation and resulted in a decrease in tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis. In addition, expression of FAK mutants (Y397F and Y925F) in IGR-Heu sensitive cells indicates that the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 is a key determinant in the regulation of cell adhesion and susceptibility to CTLs. It has been reported that FAK can bind directly to Arp2/3 and N-WASp (39Serrels B. Serrels A. Brunton V.G. Holt M. McLean G.W. Gray C.H. Jones G.E. Frame M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 40Wu X. Suetsugu S. Cooper L.A. Takenawa T. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9565-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) implicated in T cell activation and immunological synapse formation. Whether these interactions occur in tumor target cells has to be determined. Future studies will be focused on the role of FAK downstream effectors during the modulation of immunological synapse formation and CTL/target cross-talk. Our findings are particularly interesting in the context of recent in vivo studies, which showed a link between a decrease in FAK expression and a poor clinical outcome in cancer (41Ohta R. Yamashita Y. Taketomi A. Kitagawa D. Kuroda Y. Itoh S. Aishima S. Maehara Y. Oncology. 2006; 71: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Gabriel B. zur Hausen A. Stickeler E. Dietz C. Gitsch G. Fischer D.C. Bouda J. Tempfer C. Hasenburg A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 2476-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that inhibition of FAK activity resulted in an increased carcinoma cell migration through the dissolution of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts in HeLa cells (43Yano H. Mazaki Y. Kurokawa K. Hanks S.K. Matsuda M. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In contrast, FAK protein overexpression has been found in invasive human tumors (44Madan R. Smolkin M.B. Cocker R. Fayyad R. Oktay M.H. Hum. Pathol. 2006; 37: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 45Oktay M.H. Oktay K. Hamele-Bena D. Buyuk A. Koss L.G. Hum. Pathol. 2003; 34: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that targeting FAK might reduce cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion (37McLean G.W. Carragher N.O. Avizienyte E. Evans J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 46Liu T.J. LaFortune T. Honda T. Ohmori O. Hatakeyama S. Meyer T. Jackson D. de Groot J. Yung W.K. Mol.

The investigation of FAK-related signaling should therefore provide new insights into how FAK exerts a dual effect within tumor cells by promoting pro- or anti-apoptotic pathways. Together our results are consistent with a model whereby the alteration of cytoskeleton in resistant tumor variant and the changes in cell plasticity interfere with cell adhesion and FAK/Rho-dependent pathways. Our findings point to the existence of a relationship between the acquisition of tumor resistance to CTL-induced killing and FAK pathway that appears to be involved in effector/target conjugate formation and the subsequent tumor cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2058184966,"Background Caffeine stimulates calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) in many cell types. In neurons, caffeine stimulates CICR presynaptically and thus modulates neurotransmitter release. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique we found that caffeine (20 mM) reversibly increased the frequency and decreased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in neocortical neurons. The increase in mEPSC frequency is consistent with a presynaptic mechanism. Caffeine also reduced exogenously applied glutamate-activated currents, confirming a separate postsynaptic action. This inhibition developed in tens of milliseconds, consistent with block of channel currents. Caffeine (20 mM) did not reduce currents activated by exogenous NMDA, indicating that caffeine block is specific to non-NMDA type glutamate receptors. Conclusions/Significance Caffeine-induced inhibition of mEPSC amplitude occurs through postsynaptic block of non-NMDA type ionotropic glutamate receptors. Caffeine thus has both pre and postsynaptic sites of action at excitatory synapses."

Chaperone activity, determined with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and betaL-crystallin as target proteins, was increased in alphaA(1-172) and decreased in alphaA(1-168) and alphaA(1-162). The purpose of this study was to show whether the absence of the C-terminal residues influences protein-protein interactions with target proteins.Our hypothesis is that the chaperone-target protein binding kinetics, otherwise termed subunit exchange rates, are expected to reflect the changes in chaperone activity. To study this, we have relied on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) utilizing amine specific and cysteine specific fluorescent probes. The subunit exchange rate (k) for ADH and alphaA(1-172) was nearly the same as that of ADH and alphaA-wt, alphaA(1-168) had lower and alphaA(1-162) had the lowest k values. When betaL-crystallin was used as the target protein, alphaA(1-172) had slightly higher k value than alphaA-wt and alphaA(1-168) and alphaA(1-162) had lower k values. As expected from earlier studies, the chaperone activity of alphaA(1-172) was slightly better than that of alphaA-wt, the chaperone activity of alphaA(1-168) was similar to that of alphaA-wt and alphaA(1-162) had substantially decreased chaperone activity.Cleavage of eleven C-terminal residues including Arg-163 and the C-terminal flexible arm significantly affects the interaction with target proteins. The predominantly hydrophilic flexible arm appears to be needed to keep the chaperone-target protein complex soluble."
https://openalex.org/W2038103422,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism for inhibiting gene expression through the action of small, non-coding RNAs. Most existing RNAi libraries target single genes through canonical pathways. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs), however, often target multiple genes and can act through non-canonical pathways, including pathways that activate gene expression. To interrogate all possible functions, we designed, synthesized, and validated the first shRNA-encoding library that is completely random at the nucleotide level. Screening in an IL3-dependent cell line, FL5.12, yielded shRNA-encoding sequences that double cell survival upon IL3 withdrawal. Using random mutagenesis and re-screening under more stringent IL3-starvation conditions, we hit-optimized one of the sequences; a specific nucleotide change and the creation of a mismatch between the two halves of the stem both contributed to the improved potency. Our library allows unbiased selection and optimization of shRNA-encoding sequences that confer phenotypes of interest, and could be used for the development of therapeutics and tools in many fields of biology."
https://openalex.org/W2121745554,"Surface lightness perception is affected by scene interpretation. There is some experimental evidence that perceived lightness under bi-ocular viewing conditions is different from perceived lightness in actual scenes but there are also reports that viewing conditions have little or no effect on perceived color. We investigated how mixes of depth cues affect perception of lightness in three-dimensional rendered scenes containing strong gradients of illumination in depth.Observers viewed a virtual room (4 m width x 5 m height x 17.5 m depth) with checkerboard walls and floor. In four conditions, the room was presented with or without binocular disparity (BD) depth cues and with or without motion parallax (MP) depth cues. In all conditions, observers were asked to adjust the luminance of a comparison surface to match the lightness of test surfaces placed at seven different depths (8.5-17.5 m) in the scene. We estimated lightness versus depth profiles in all four depth cue conditions. Even when observers had only pictorial depth cues (no MP, no BD), they partially but significantly discounted the illumination gradient in judging lightness. Adding either MP or BD led to significantly greater discounting and both cues together produced the greatest discounting. The effects of MP and BD were approximately additive. BD had greater influence at near distances than far.These results suggest the surface lightness perception is modulated by three-dimensional perception/interpretation using pictorial, binocular-disparity, and motion-parallax cues additively. We propose a two-stage (2D and 3D) processing model for lightness perception."
https://openalex.org/W2006594785,"To what extent are the left and right visual hemifields spatially coded in the dorsal frontoparietal attention network? In many experiments with neglect patients, the left hemisphere shows a contralateral hemifield preference, whereas the right hemisphere represents both hemifields. This pattern of spatial coding is often used to explain the right-hemispheric dominance of lesions causing hemispatial neglect. However, pathophysiological mechanisms of hemispatial neglect are controversial because recent experiments on healthy subjects produced conflicting results regarding the spatial coding of visual hemifields. We used an fMRI paradigm that allowed us to distinguish two attentional subprocesses during a visual search task. Either within the left or right hemifield subjects first attended to stationary locations (spatial orienting) and then shifted their attentional focus to search for a target line. Dynamic changes in spatial coding of the left and right hemifields were observed within subregions of the dorsal front-parietal network: During stationary spatial orienting, we found the well-known spatial pattern described above, with a bilateral hemifield representation in the right hemisphere and a contralateral preference in the left hemisphere. However, during search, the right hemisphere had a contralateral preference and the left hemisphere equally represented both hemifields. This finding leads to novel perspectives regarding models of visuospatial attention and hemispatial neglect."
https://openalex.org/W1975071865,"A single internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in conjunction with IRES transactivating factors (ITAFs) is sufficient to recruit the translational machinery to a eukaryotic mRNA independent of the cap structure. However, we demonstrate that the mouse TrkB mRNA contains two independent IRESes. The mouse TrkB mRNA consists of one of two 5′ leaders (1428 nt and 448 nt), both of which include the common 3′ exon (Ex2, 344 nt). Dicistronic RNA transfections and in vitro translation of monocistronic RNA demonstrated that both full-length 5′ leaders, as well as Ex2, exhibit IRES activity indicating the IRES is located within Ex2. Additional analysis of the upstream sequences demonstrated that the first 260 nt of exon 1 (Ex1a) also contains an IRES. Dicistronic RNA transfections into SH-SY5Y cells showed the Ex1a IRES is constitutively active. However, the Ex2 IRES is only active in response to retinoic acid induced neural differentiation, a state which correlates with the synthesis of the ITAF polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB1). Correspondingly, addition or knock-down of PTB1 altered Ex2, but not Ex1a IRES activity in vitro and ex vivo, respectively. These results demonstrate that the two functionally independent IRESes within the mouse TrkB 5′ leader are differentially regulated, in part by PTB1."

Previous studies have focused on elucidating the processing and sorting determinants of proTRH. However, the role of protein folding in the sorting of proTRH remains unexplored. Here we have investigated the role in the secretion of proTRH of a sequence comprising 22 amino acid residues, located at the N-terminal region of proTRH, residues 31–52. Complete deletion of these 22 amino acids dramatically compromised the biosynthesis of proTRH, manifested as a severe reduction in the steady state level of proTRH in the endoplasmic reticulum. This effect was largely reproduced by the deletion of only three amino acid residues, 40PGL42, within the proTRH31–52 sequence. The decreased steady state level of the mutant ΔPGL was due to enhanced endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. However, the remnant of ΔPGL that escaped degradation was properly processed and sorted to secretory granules.

Hypophysiotropic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) 2The abbreviations used are: TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; SG, secretory granule; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; BFA, brefeldin A. is produced in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and stimulates thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary (1Nillni E.A. Sevarino K. A Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 599-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). TRH is an essential neuropeptide hormone for maintaining thyroid hormone homeostasis. Like other potent secretory molecules regulating key biological functions, TRH active peptide is initially synthesized from an inactive prohormone. In general, maturation of a prohormone implicates many coordinated cellular and biochemical steps along the regulated secretory pathway. First, the signal sequence of the preprohormone is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Once in the ER, the newly synthesized prohormone meets a unique environment containing a number of ER-specific chaperones involved in its folding pathway leading to its wild type conformation. In addition, prohormones, like all secretory proteins, encounter an exclusive set of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, sulfation, and specific peptide-bond cleavages provided by a network of processing peptidases. The prohormone is transported from the ER to the Golgi complex and then to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where an initial proteolytic processing event may occur. At the TGN, prohormone products are sorted and stored in specialized secretory granules (SGs) that undergo secretion only after appropriate stimuli. In these SGs the final processing steps take place that involve endoproteolysis by specific prohormone convertases at pair of basic residues (2Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol.

If one of these regulated steps is compromised, the biosynthesis of the prohormone-derived peptides and their secretion may be affected. The 231-amino acid residues in the primary sequence of rat proTRH include 5 copies of TRH sequences and 7 non-TRH peptides (Fig. 1). Extensive research has been done during the last two decades to understand the post-translational processing of proTRH (11Sevarino K.A. Goodman R.H. Spiess J. Jackson I.M.D. Wu P. J. Biol.

Nillni E.A. Regul. Pept. 2006; 133: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) has been uncovered. However, the maturation process of the proTRH precursor in ER, and the structural features involved in intracellular traffic from ER to the Golgi has yet to be elucidated. The primary sequence of preproTRH has a segment of 25 amino acid residues, pYE26, after the signal sequence (Fig. 1). Here we have investigated the role of this amino acid segment in early and late events of proTRH traffic. By expressing several deletion and point mutations within the preproTRH31–52 sequence and by monitoring the steady state production of proTRH in the ER we have identified that the single copy tripeptide 40PGL42, conserved in mammals, is important for the stability, in terms of resistance to protein degradation, of proTRH. Investigation of the role of PGL in the downstream processes of proTRH secretion, such as trafficking from ER to the TGN, initial processing, and sorting to the SGs, revealed that PGL is primarily involved in the stability of proTRH in the early secretory pathway. Deletion of PGL destabilizes proTRH by targeting the protein to the proteasome for degradation. This is the first evidence showing that the structural role played by a short motif located in the N-terminal region of proTRH takes place early in the ER and has important consequences on precursor stability rather than the sorting process to the SGs per se. preproTRH Mutants Constructs—Rat preproTRH was removed from the pCMV-TRH-SV40 vector by EcoRI digestion and then subcloned into pCDNA3.1/zeo+ plasmid (Invitrogen). This plasmid drives expression of cloned genes with the constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter. This construct was used for in vitro expression of wild type preproTRH and as a template for creation of eight different preproTRH mutants. Except for deletion of the last 15 amino acids of preproTRH, all the residues truncated were located in the N-terminal region of the precursor (Table 1). The mutations of preproTRH were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. All mutants generated were confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1List of the mutant constructs used in this studyNomenclaturePoint mutationDescriptionproTRHWild typeWild type preproTRH1-255Δ31-52preproTRH31-52Deletion of N-terminal 22 amino acids leaving intact the first 6 amino acids preceded by the signal sequenceΔ241-255preproTRH241-255Deletion of C-terminal 15 amino acidsPGL/EKApreproTRH40-42Pro-Gly-Leu replaced by Glu-Lys-AlaΔPGLpreproTRH40-42Deletion of Pro-Gly-LeuPGL/GGGpreproTRH40-42Pro-Gly-Leu replaced by Gly-Gly-GlyAVT/GGGpreproTRH34-36Ala-Val-Thr replaced by Gly-Gly-GlyΔAVTpreproTRH34-36Deletion of Ala-Val-ThrR51G/R52GpreproTRH51,52Arg-Arg replaced by Gly-GlyPGL/AAApreproTRH40-42Pro-Gly-Leu replaced by Ala-Ala-Ala Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—AtT20 mouse pituitary cells (D16v-F2 subclone; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with high glucose, 30 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as previously described (20Mulcahy L.R. Vaslet C.A. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39818-39826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rat pituitary GH4C1 cell line was grown in the same media as AtT20 cells. Plasmid DNA was transiently transfected into cells using Lipofectamine and Plus Reagent system (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was evaluated by co-transfection with Clontech vector pEGFP1 and subsequent visualization of green fluorescence protein. For each transfection more than 400 cells co-expressing wild type or mutant DNA and pEGFP1 were analyzed to ensure the same transfection efficiency. Western Blot Analysis—Forty-eight hours after transfection of AtT20 cells with either wild type or different preproTRH mutants DNA plasmids, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected using a cell scraper, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed (13,000 rpm), and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% TBS-Tween, and incubated overnight with primary antibody anti-pCC10 (dilution 1:1000) in blocking solution. This antibody was made in rabbit against a synthetic decapeptide that includes a TRH sequence (Gln-His-Pro) and several amino acids flanking this sequence (Cys-Lys-Arg-Gln-His-Pro-Gly-Lys-Arg-Cys) (Table 2) and recognizes proTRH and some intermediate forms of processing (18Cruz I.P. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22736-22745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After washing 3 times with 0.1% TBS-Tween, the blots were incubated with goat antirabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:2000). Proteins were detected using ImmunStar alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad). Quantification was performed normalizing with β-tubulin and using alphaEraseFC software.TABLE 2Polyclonal antibodies used in this study against different epitopes of the proTRH sequence and the peptides they recognizeAntibodiesEpitopesMoieties recognizedAnti-pCC10Cys-Lys-Arg-Gln-His-Pro-Gly-Lys-Arg-CyspreproTRH25-255 (26 kDA) preproTRH25-151 (15 kDa) preproTRH25-112 (9.5 kDa)Anti-pYE26preproTRH25-50preproTRH25-50 (4 kDa)Anti-pEH24preproTRH83-106preproTRH83-106 (2.8 kDa)Anti-pYE17preproTRH240-255preproTRH208-255 (5.4 kDa) Open table in a new tab Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from AtT20 cells transfected according to the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) method. RNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate water and quantified with a spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, DU 640) at 260 and 280 nm. RNA with a 2.0 260/280-nm ratio was used for cDNA synthesis. Reverse transcription was performed with 2 μl of total RNA after treatment with DNase I (Roche Applied Science). cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Amplification of wild type preproTRH and Δ31–52 mutant was performed using specific primers (forward, 5′-TGC CGC TTG ACT TGG GG GAC AT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGG GAC CTC GGT GCT GCC TTA GAC-3′) resulting in a 275-bp PCR product. Primers used to amplify glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as internal control were (forward, 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′). cDNA cycling parameters used for were 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min (30 cycles), and 72 °C for 10 min. All PCR products were analyzed in a 1.4% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In Vitro Cell-free Translation—In vitro cell-free translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) was utilized to analyze the translation competency for the wild type proTRH and mutants. Briefly, in a one-step reaction 1 μg of DNA plasmid containing the SP6 promoter, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, buffer reaction, RNA polymerase, amino acids mixture lacking leucine, 2.5 μCi of [3H]leucine, RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, and nuclease-free water was incubated at a total volume of 25 μl for 90 min at 30 °C. Then 500 μl of neutral buffer (50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) was added to the initial reaction volume and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-pCC10 antibody. The protein A/G-agarose-antibody conjugates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer. 2× sample buffer was then added to the beads, and the sample was boiled for 10 min. The tubes were centrifuged for 30 s, and the supernatants were fractionated with SDS-PAGE gels as described in the pulse-chase experiments section below. Levels of in vitro protein translated were determined by radioactivity counting (cpm) in a β counter (Beckman Counter, Fullerton, CA) and corrected as previously described (20Mulcahy L.R. Vaslet C.A. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39818-39826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protein Degradation Studies—AtT20 cells were grown in 6-wells plates and transiently transfected with wild type preproTRH, Δ31–52, ΔPG, and PGL/GGG DNA plasmids. 48 h after transfection cells were treated with 5 μm lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, for 16 h or with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) for 4 h, which specifically and reversibly blocks protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. BFA has been extensively used to study where the intracellular degradation takes place. An equivalent volume of the vehicle control was always used in parallel. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described earlier under “Experimental Procedures.” Pulse-Chase Experiments—The experimental conditions for pulse-chase experiments in transfected AtT20 cells with preproTRH cDNA was fully described in our earlier studies (20Mulcahy L.R. Vaslet C.A. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39818-39826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, to analyze the prohormone (26 kDa) maturation, AtT20 cells transfected with either wild type preproTRH or ΔPGL and PGL/GGG mutants were preincubated 30 min with media lacking leucine. Cells were pulsed 2 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium labeling media and 400 μCi of [3H]leucine and then chased for a 0, 45, and 90 min. Cells were scraped in neutral buffer (50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and lysed by sonication. The samples were centrifuged 30 min at 13,000 rpm, and the clarified lysated was immunoprecipitated with anti-pCC10 antibody for 2 h and 30 min and then for 2 h with ImmunoPure Immobilized Recombinant Protein A beads (Pierce). Anti-pCC10 antibody precipitates the entire precursor (26 kDa) and the N-terminal intermediate precursors (15 and 9.5 kDa) (18Cruz I.P. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22736-22745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Then, the protein A/G-agarose-antibody conjugates were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer. 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was then added to the beads and boiled for 10 min. The supernatants were fractionated with 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was cut into 2-mm slices with a gel-slicer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco) and placed individually in scintillation vials. Quantifications of gels containing 3H-labeled proteins at 0, 45, and 90 min chase time was done with a Beckman LS 1801 Liquid Scintillation System. Secretion Studies under Steady State Conditions—As described earlier (21Mulcahy L.R. Barker A.J. Nillni E.A. Regul. Pept. 2006; 133: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), wild type or mutants preproTRH constructs were transiently transfected into AtT20 cells. 48 h after transfection, the cells were twice washed with Hanks' solution and incubated for 1 h with preincubated incomplete media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The basal medium was then collected (basal release), cells were washed again, and the cells were incubated for 1 h in secretion medium containing 1 mm BaCl2 and then collected (stimulated release). Cells were scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline after stimulation and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were then lysed by the addition of 500 μl of 2 n acetic acid with protease inhibitor mixture and heated to 95 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The total amount of proteins was assayed from clarified lysates by Bradford method. Cell content, basal release, and stimulated release were measured by radioimmunoassay for proTRH-derived peptides as described below. Radioimmunoassay Analysis—proTRH-derived peptides from cell content, basal release, and stimulated release were measured by radioimmunoassay assay using specific antibodies custom-synthesized or commercially available and fully characterized by our laboratory (13Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1271-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study we used the N-terminal antiserum anti-preproTRH83–106 (anti-pEH24), the C-terminal antiserum anti-preproTRH240–255 (anti-pYE17) (Table 2), and TRH antiserum that recognizes only TRH mature neuropeptide. The tracers were iodinated using the chloramine T oxidation-reduction method followed by high performance liquid chromatography purification. The intra- and interassay variability was 5–6 and 9–12%, respectively. Deletion of the N-terminal preproTRH(31–52) Sequence Has a Dramatic Effect on Steady State proTRH Protein Levels in AtT20 Cultures—The role of the N-terminal region of proTRH was tested by expressing wild type proTRH, Δ31–52, and Δ241–255 mutants (Table 1). AtT20s possess two secretory pathways, the constitutive secretory pathway for immediate secretion and the regulated secretory pathway for accumulation, and release under hormonal stimulation. The amount of prohormone under steady state conditions was analyzed by Western blotting using the antibody anti-pCC10 that recognizes the entire rat proTRH (26 kDa). Because of the deletion of 22 amino acid residues in Δ31–52 and 15 amino acids in Δ241–255, these mutants displayed a molecular mass of ∼23 and 24 kDa, respectively. The results show a 9-fold decrease in the protein levels of the Δ31–52 prohormone compared with the wild type precursor. Removal of the C-terminal 15 amino acids in Δ241–255 mutant did not alter the amount of protein precursor (Fig. 2), implying that the effect of Δ31–52 is not merely due to the shortening of the preproTRH amino acid sequence. This finding suggests that this 22-amino acid stretch, which we call a proregion from here on, may contain critical information for the viability of the precursor. A typical double band was observed for proTRH when using this specific antibody that could represent a potential glycosylation of proTRH. The dramatic decrease in steady state protein levels of the mutant Δ31–52 precursor could be due to transcriptional or translational defects and/or due to post-translational degradation. To test for transcriptional defects, proTRH transcription in wild type and Δ31–52 mutant-transfected AtT20s was analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Fig. 2B shows similar transcription levels for both constructs. The similar numbers of mRNA of wild type and Δ31–52 were also equally efficiently translated as judged by an in vitro cell-free translation system (Fig. 2C). A possible post-translational degradation of the Δ31–52 mutant was studied using an inhibitor of the ERAD system. Lactacystin is a specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, a large protein complex located in the cytosol of all eukaryotic cells that degrades damaged or unfolded proteins (22Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Lactacystin treatment of transfected AtT20 cells with wild type preproTRH showed a 1.5-fold increase in protein levels suggesting that wild type proTRH is partially degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions. However, upon lactacystin treatment, the Δ31–52 mutant protein level raised about 3.6-fold (Fig. 3A). These results indicate the proteasome degrades ∼70% of the mutated prohormone compared with the 30% degradation of the wild type. Because the level of mutant precursor was not completely restored to wild type levels by lactacystin, we studied the possible involvement of post-ER degradation at the lysosomal system by blocking the protein traffic from ER to Golgi complex with BFA. We observed that the amount of the precursor detected after a 4-h BFA incubation of AtT20 cells expressing wild type and Δ31–52 mutant was 1.2-fold higher for the wild type and ∼2-fold for the Δ31–52 precursor (Fig. 3B). These results reveal a limited post-ER, lysosomal-mediated degradation of the Δ31–52 protein. The increase of precursor in wild type protein is expected because BFA not only blocks the traffic from ER to Golgi complex, but it also impairs the processing at the TGN, accumulating the entire precursor (26 kDa) in pre-Golgi compartments (18Cruz I.P. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22736-22745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two important initial conclusions can be drawn from these set of experiments. 1) the quality control system of the secretory pathway identifies Δ31–52 as a non-native molecule, targeting it for degradation mainly in the proteasome. 2) An essential domain for proper proTRH folding stability resides within amino acids 31–52 sequence. The 40PGL42 Sequence within the Prodomain Determines the proTRH Protein Levels—To determine whether the essential role of the preproTRH31–52 amino acid segment involves the whole sequence or only part of it, we produced several mutations within this segment (Table 1). Essential domains in proteins of high biological impact, such as hormones, are expected to be conserved in closely related species. Protein sequence alignment of proTRH from selected mammalian species revealed 2 conserved 3-amino acid sequences within the prodomain, Pro-Gly-Leu (40PGL42) and Ala-Val-Thr (34AVT36). The cleavage site at 51RR52 is conserved in rat and mouse but not in humans. Because the removal of the prodomain resulted in a dramatic decrease in proTRH levels (Fig. 2A), we first analyzed the role of 40PGL42, 34AVT36, and 51RR52 on proTRH protein levels. We compared three different PGL mutations: ΔPGL, PGL/GGG, PGL/AAA and PGL/EKA. Replacement of Pro-Gly-Leu (40PGL42) by Glu-Lys-Ala (EKA) present in the corresponding position in Xenopus was used as a control as well. EKA is not present in mammals at this position and contains two charged amino acids. The PGL/EKA and ΔPGL mutants accumulated around 60 and 50%, respectively, less protein than wild type proTRH (Fig. 4A). This reduction is less dramatic than the one observed for the mutant Δ31–52, but it is still significant. Interestingly, when PGL was replaced by GGG, a 35% increase of the precursor was observed (Fig. 4A). Because Gly possesses a wider conformational freedom, we also analyzed the triple Ala mutant, and we observed a 2.6-fold increased on protein precursor (Fig. 4D). Additionally, the effect of PGL mutants expressed in different secretory cell lines was assessed. GH4C1 is a rat pituitary cell line that lacks prohormone convertases PC1/3 and PC2. It has secretory granules but with low efficiency sorts and stores endogenously and exogenously expressed proteins to the regulated secretory pathway (23Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Arvan P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1959-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These properties make this cell line a good model to study the importance of PGL motif within the N-terminal proregion independently of processing by PC1/3 and PC2. GH4C1 cells were transfected with wild type, Δ31–52, PGL/EKA, ΔPGL, or PGL/GGG proTRH mutants, and the protein precursor was analyzed under steady state conditions. There is a 50% decrease of precursor for Δ31–52, a 30% decrease for PGL/EKA, and a 35% decrease for ΔPGL (Fig. 4C). Although the decrease observed with these mutants in GH4C1 cells is less pronounced than the decrease observed in AtT20 cells (Fig. 4A), the overall effect was similar. Interestingly, PGL/GGG in GH4C1 cells did not accumulate (Fig. 4C), as was observed in AtT20 cells (Fig. 4A). We next analyzed the importance of the other conserved sequences in the prodomain, AVT, and the cleavage site 51RR52. We tested the 34AVT36 deletion (ΔAVT), AVT/GGG replacement, and the 51RR52 to GG replacement (R51G/R52G) mutants. Western blot analysis of the protein levels of AVT/GGG, ΔAVT, and R51G/R52G mutants revealed no decrease in protein levels compared with the wild type in any of these truncations (Fig. 4B). Instead, a significant increment of AVT/GGG and ΔAVT and a slight increase for R51G/R52G (∼15%) were observed. Other Gly substitutions in conserved cleavage sites out of the preproTRH(25–52) sequence do not alter at all the amount of the precursor compared with wild type (data not show). These results together suggest that of the two conserved three-amino acid sequences in the proTRH prodomain, the presence of PGL but not of AVT or R51G/R52G was necessary for the survival of the protein. Secretion Efficiency of the proTRH-derived Peptides Correlates with the Abundance of the Protein Precursor—Because mutations in the N-terminal proregion alter the protein levels of the precursor, we assessed the correlation between precursor availability and secretion efficiency. Processing of proTRH generates several peptides, including the N-terminal peptide pEH24, the C-terminal 5.4-kDa fragment, and TRH, which can be readily quantified by radioimmunoassay (20Mulcahy L.R. Vaslet"
