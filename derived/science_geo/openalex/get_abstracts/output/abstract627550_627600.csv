https://openalex.org/W2911248861,"Accumulation of damaged mitochondria is a hallmark of aging and age-related neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The molecular mechanisms of impaired mitochondrial homeostasis in AD are being investigated. Here we provide evidence that mitophagy is impaired in the hippocampus of AD patients, in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human AD neurons, and in animal AD models. In both amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau Caenorhabditis elegans models of AD, mitophagy stimulation (through NAD+ supplementation, urolithin A, and actinonin) reverses memory impairment through PINK-1 (PTEN-induced kinase-1)-, PDR-1 (Parkinson's disease-related-1; parkin)-, or DCT-1 (DAF-16/FOXO-controlled germline-tumor affecting-1)-dependent pathways. Mitophagy diminishes insoluble Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 and prevents cognitive impairment in an APP/PS1 mouse model through microglial phagocytosis of extracellular Aβ plaques and suppression of neuroinflammation. Mitophagy enhancement abolishes AD-related tau hyperphosphorylation in human neuronal cells and reverses memory impairment in transgenic tau nematodes and mice. Our findings suggest that impaired removal of defective mitochondria is a pivotal event in AD pathogenesis and that mitophagy represents a potential therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2911752971,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and is associated with poor survival. The Ivy Foundation Early Phase Clinical Trials Consortium conducted a randomized, multi-institution clinical trial to evaluate immune responses and survival following neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab in 35 patients with recurrent, surgically resectable glioblastoma. Patients who were randomized to receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, with continued adjuvant therapy following surgery, had significantly extended overall survival compared to patients that were randomized to receive adjuvant, post-surgical programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade alone. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade was associated with upregulation of T cell– and interferon-γ-related gene expression, but downregulation of cell-cycle-related gene expression within the tumor, which was not seen in patients that received adjuvant therapy alone. Focal induction of programmed death-ligand 1 in the tumor microenvironment, enhanced clonal expansion of T cells, decreased PD-1 expression on peripheral blood T cells and a decreasing monocytic population was observed more frequently in the neoadjuvant group than in patients treated only in the adjuvant setting. These findings suggest that the neoadjuvant administration of PD-1 blockade enhances both the local and systemic antitumor immune response and may represent a more efficacious approach to the treatment of this uniformly lethal brain tumor. Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab promotes a survival benefit with intratumoral and systemic immune responses in patients with recurrent glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2911871569,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been successful across several tumor types; however, their efficacy has been uncommon and unpredictable in glioblastomas (GBM), where <10% of patients show long-term responses. To understand the molecular determinants of immunotherapeutic response in GBM, we longitudinally profiled 66 patients, including 17 long-term responders, during standard therapy and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab). Genomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of PTEN mutations associated with immunosuppressive expression signatures in non-responders, and an enrichment of MAPK pathway alterations (PTPN11, BRAF) in responders. Responsive tumors were also associated with branched patterns of evolution from the elimination of neoepitopes as well as with differences in T cell clonal diversity and tumor microenvironment profiles. Our study shows that clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in GBM is associated with specific molecular alterations, immune expression signatures, and immune infiltration that reflect the tumor's clonal evolution during treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2915013877,"Broad use of CRISPR-Cas12a (formerly Cpf1) nucleases1 has been hindered by the requirement for an extended TTTV protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)2. To address this limitation, we engineered an enhanced Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a variant (enAsCas12a) that has a substantially expanded targeting range, enabling targeting of many previously inaccessible PAMs. On average, enAsCas12a exhibits a twofold higher genome editing activity on sites with canonical TTTV PAMs compared to wild-type AsCas12a, and we successfully grafted a subset of mutations from enAsCas12a onto other previously described AsCas12a variants3 to enhance their activities. enAsCas12a improves the efficiency of multiplex gene editing, endogenous gene activation and C-to-T base editing, and we engineered a high-fidelity version of enAsCas12a (enAsCas12a-HF1) to reduce off-target effects. Both enAsCas12a and enAsCas12a-HF1 function in HEK293T and primary human T cells when delivered as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Collectively, enAsCas12a provides an optimized version of Cas12a that should enable wider application of Cas12a enzymes for gene and epigenetic editing."

https://openalex.org/W2911407981,"Cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions in Alzheimer's disease patients and related mouse models have been recognized for decades, but the underlying mechanisms and resulting consequences for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice we found that an increased number of cortical capillaries had stalled blood flow as compared to in wild-type animals, largely due to neutrophils that had adhered in capillary segments and blocked blood flow. Administration of antibodies against the neutrophil marker Ly6G reduced the number of stalled capillaries, leading to both an immediate increase in CBF and rapidly improved performance in spatial and working memory tasks. This study identified a previously uncharacterized cellular mechanism that explains the majority of the CBF reduction seen in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated that improving CBF rapidly enhanced short-term memory function. Restoring cerebral perfusion by preventing neutrophil adhesion may provide a strategy for improving cognition in Alzheimer's disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W2914679425,"Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for advanced stage gastric cancer (GC) patients and chemotherapy resistance is the major obstacle to effective cancer therapy. Increasing evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make important contributions to development of drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we discovered that abundant MSCs in tumor tissues predicted a poor prognosis in GC patients. MSCs promoted stemness and chemoresistance in GC cells through fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) secretion by MSCs activated SMAD2/3 through TGF-β receptors and induced long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MACC1-AS1 expression in GC cells, which promoted FAO-dependent stemness and chemoresistance through antagonizing miR-145-5p. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of FAO with etomoxir (ETX) attenuated MSC-induced FOLFOX regiment resistance in vivo. These results suggest that FAO plays an important role in MSC-mediated stemness and chemotherapy resistance in GC and FAO inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs present as a promising strategy to overcome chemoresistance."

We generated transcriptional profiles of postmortem retinas from 453 controls and cases at distinct stages of AMD and integrated retinal transcriptomes, covering 13,662 protein-coding and 1,462 noncoding genes, with genotypes at more than 9 million common SNPs for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of a tissue not included in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and other large datasets4,5. Cis-eQTL analysis identified 10,474 genes under genetic regulation, including 4,541 eQTLs detected only in the retina. Integrated analysis of AMD-GWAS with eQTLs ascertained likely target genes at six reported loci. Using transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS), we identified three additional genes, RLBP1, HIC1 and PARP12, after Bonferroni correction. Our studies expand the genetic landscape of AMD and establish the Eye Genotype Expression (EyeGEx) database as a resource for post-GWAS interpretation of multifactorial ocular traits. The authors transcriptionally profiled postmortem retinas from 453 age-related macular degeneration (AMD) cases and controls. Integration of AMD GWAS with eQTL analysis and TWAS identified several AMD-associated genes."

https://openalex.org/W2914270121,Tumor-infiltrating B cells are an important component in the microenvironment but have unclear anti-tumor effects. We enhanced our previous computational algorithm TRUST to extract the B cell immunoglobulin hypervariable regions from bulk tumor RNA-sequencing data. TRUST assembled more than 30 million complementarity-determining region 3 sequences of the B cell heavy chain (IgH) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Widespread B cell clonal expansions and immunoglobulin subclass switch events were observed in diverse human cancers. Prevalent somatic copy number alterations in the MICA and MICB genes related to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity were identified in tumors with elevated B cell activity. The IgG3-1 subclass switch interacts with B cell-receptor affinity maturation and defects in the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. Comprehensive pancancer analyses of tumor-infiltrating B cell-receptor repertoires identified novel tumor immune evasion mechanisms through genetic alterations. The IgH sequences identified here are potentially useful resources for future development of immunotherapies.
https://openalex.org/W2914685295,"Balanced chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions and translocations can cause congenital disease or cancer by inappropriately rewiring promoter-enhancer contacts1,2. To study the potentially pathogenic consequences of balanced chromosomal rearrangements, we generated a series of genomic inversions by placing an active limb enhancer cluster from the Epha4 regulatory domain at different positions within a neighbouring gene-dense region and investigated their effects on gene regulation in vivo in mice. Expression studies and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture from embryonic limb buds showed that the enhancer cluster activated several genes downstream that are located within asymmetric regions of contact, the so-called architectural stripes3. The ectopic activation of genes led to a limb phenotype that could be rescued by deleting the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) anchor of the stripe. Architectural stripes appear to be driven by enhancer activity, because they do not form in mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, we show that architectural stripes are a frequent feature of developmental three-dimensional genome architecture often associated with active enhancers. Therefore, balanced chromosomal rearrangements can induce ectopic gene expression and the formation of asymmetric chromatin contact patterns that are dependent on CTCF anchors and enhancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W2912344709,"This paper presents global research trends involving highly cited articles on ecosystem services from 1981 to 2017 based on a bibliometric analysis of such articles from the SCI-E and SSCI databases of the Web of Science. The analysis revealed that there were 132 highly cited articles, most of which were published between 2005 and 2014. Based on author keywords, the term ecosystem services was strongly linked to biodiversity. The top three journals in terms of total number of highly cited articles published were Ecological Economics, PNAS, and Ecological Indicators. Despite ranking sixth overall, Science ranked first in both impact factor and total citations per article. The US, UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden were the top five most productive and cooperative countries in the world based on total number of highly cited articles and co-authorship network, respectively. The US was highly connected to Canada, the Netherlands, China and the UK. Stockholm University and Stanford University were the most productive institutions in Europe and North America, respectively. Stanford University is associated with many scholars in the field of ecosystem services research because of the InVEST model. Robert Costanza was the most prolific and highly cited author, the latter being largely due to the first valuation of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital, he and his co-authors published in 1997 in Nature. Terrestrial, urban, and forest ecosystems were the top types of ecosystems assessed. Regulating and provisioning services were the major ecosystem services studied. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were the main research focus. Most of these highly cited studies on ecosystem services are done on areas geographically located in North America and Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2914392855,"Motor behaviour is most efficiently controlled by correcting only disturbances that influence task success. It is currently thought that such control is computed within a transcortical feedback pathway. Here we show that, for postural hand control, even the fastest spinal feedback pathway can produce efficient corrective responses, forcing a re-evaluation of how the nervous system derives the control laws that support motor behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2911581233,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for multiple disorders, but deficiency and dysregulation of T cells limit its utility. Here we report a biomaterial-based scaffold that mimics features of T cell lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow. The bone marrow cryogel (BMC) releases bone morphogenetic protein-2 to recruit stromal cells and presents the Notch ligand Delta-like ligand-4 to facilitate T cell lineage specification of mouse and human hematopoietic progenitor cells. BMCs subcutaneously injected in mice at the time of HSCT enhanced T cell progenitor seeding of the thymus, T cell neogenesis and diversification of the T cell receptor repertoire. Peripheral T cell reconstitution increased ~6-fold in mouse HSCT and ~2-fold in human xenogeneic HSCT. Furthermore, BMCs promoted donor CD4+ regulatory T cell generation and improved survival after allogeneic HSCT. In comparison to adoptive transfer of T cell progenitors, BMCs increased donor chimerism, T cell generation and antigen-specific T cell responses to vaccination. BMCs may provide an off-the-shelf approach for enhancing T cell regeneration and mitigating graft-versus-host disease in HSCT."
https://openalex.org/W2949966526,"Hippocampal place cells are spatially tuned neurons that serve as elements of a 'cognitive map' in the mammalian brain1. To detect the animal's location, place cells are thought to rely upon two interacting mechanisms: sensing the position of the animal relative to familiar landmarks2,3 and measuring the distance and direction that the animal has travelled from previously occupied locations4-7. The latter mechanism-known as path integration-requires a finely tuned gain factor that relates the animal's self-movement to the updating of position on the internal cognitive map, as well as external landmarks to correct the positional error that accumulates8,9. Models of hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells based on path integration treat the path-integration gain as a constant9-14, but behavioural evidence in humans suggests that the gain is modifiable15. Here we show, using physiological evidence from rat hippocampal place cells, that the path-integration gain is a highly plastic variable that can be altered by persistent conflict between self-motion cues and feedback from external landmarks. In an augmented-reality system, visual landmarks were moved in proportion to the movement of a rat on a circular track, creating continuous conflict with path integration. Sustained exposure to this cue conflict resulted in predictable and prolonged recalibration of the path-integration gain, as estimated from the place cells after the landmarks were turned off. We propose that this rapid plasticity keeps the positional update in register with the movement of the rat in the external world over behavioural timescales. These results also demonstrate that visual landmarks not only provide a signal to correct cumulative error in the path-integration system4,8,16-19, but also rapidly fine-tune the integration computation itself."
https://openalex.org/W2913605258,"Fragile X syndrome results from a loss of the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). How FMRP regulates neuronal development and function remains unclear. Here we show that FMRP-deficient immature neurons exhibit impaired dendritic maturation, altered expression of mitochondrial genes, fragmented mitochondria, impaired mitochondrial function, and increased oxidative stress. Enhancing mitochondrial fusion partially rescued dendritic abnormalities in FMRP-deficient immature neurons. We show that FMRP deficiency leads to reduced Htt mRNA and protein levels and that HTT mediates FMRP regulation of mitochondrial fusion and dendritic maturation. Mice with hippocampal Htt knockdown and Fmr1-knockout mice showed similar behavioral deficits that could be rescued by treatment with a mitochondrial fusion compound. Our data unveil mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to the impaired dendritic maturation of FMRP-deficient neurons and suggest a role for interactions between FMRP and HTT in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2912384789,"Stem cell characteristics have been associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis across many cancer types. The ability to induce and regulate the pathways that sustain these characteristic hallmarks of lethal cancers in a novel in vitro model would greatly enhance our understanding of cancer progression and treatment resistance. In this work, we present such a model, based simply on applying standard pluripotency/embryonic stem cell media alone. Core pluripotency stem cell master regulators (OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG) along with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (Snail, Slug, vimentin and N-cadherin) were induced in human prostate, breast, lung, bladder, colorectal, and renal cancer cells. RNA sequencing revealed pathways activated by pluripotency inducing culture that were shared across all cancers examined. These pathways highlight a potential core mechanism of treatment resistance. With a focus on prostate cancer, the culture-based induction of core pluripotent stem cell regulators was shown to promote survival in castrate conditions—mimicking first line treatment resistance with hormonal therapies. This acquired phenotype was shown to be mediated through the upregulation of iodothyronine deiodinase DIO2, a critical modulator of the thyroid hormone signalling pathway. Subsequent inhibition of DIO2 was shown to supress expression of prostate specific antigen, the cardinal clinical biomarker of prostate cancer progression and highlighted a novel target for clinical translation in this otherwise fatal disease. This study identifies a new and widely accessible simple preclinical model to recreate and explore underpinning pathways of lethal disease and treatment resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2911741999,"Selective differentiation of naive T cells into multipotent T cells is of great interest clinically for the generation of cell-based cancer immunotherapies. Cellular differentiation depends crucially on division state and time. Here we adapt a dye dilution assay for tracking cell proliferative history through mass cytometry and uncouple division, time and regulatory protein expression in single naive human T cells during their activation and expansion in a complex ex vivo milieu. Using 23 markers, we defined groups of proteins controlled predominantly by division state or time and found that undivided cells account for the majority of phenotypic diversity. We next built a map of cell state changes during naive T-cell expansion. By examining cell signaling on this map, we rationally selected ibrutinib, a BTK and ITK inhibitor, and administered it before T cell activation to direct differentiation toward a T stem cell memory (TSCM)-like phenotype. This method for tracing cell fate across division states and time can be broadly applied for directing cellular differentiation. Measuring proliferation history in single-cell mass cytometry enables control of T cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2952891746,"Vertebrate tissues exhibit mechanical homeostasis, showing stable stiffness and tension over time and recovery after changes in mechanical stress. However, the regulatory pathways that mediate these effects are unknown. A comprehensive identification of Argonaute 2-associated microRNAs and mRNAs in endothelial cells identified a network of 122 microRNA families that target 73 mRNAs encoding cytoskeletal, contractile, adhesive and extracellular matrix (CAM) proteins. The level of these microRNAs increased in cells plated on stiff versus soft substrates, consistent with homeostasis, and suppressed targets via microRNA recognition elements within the 3′ untranslated regions of CAM mRNAs. Inhibition of DROSHA or Argonaute 2, or disruption of microRNA recognition elements within individual target mRNAs, such as connective tissue growth factor, induced hyper-adhesive, hyper-contractile phenotypes in endothelial and fibroblast cells in vitro, and increased tissue stiffness, contractility and extracellular matrix deposition in the zebrafish fin fold in vivo. Thus, a network of microRNAs buffers CAM expression to mediate tissue mechanical homeostasis. Moro et al. discover an Argonaute 2 (Ago2)-dependent miRNA network that, in response to substrate stiffness, regulates genes involved in tissue mechanics, and show that Ago2 restrains stiffness and contributes to regeneration in the zebrafish fin fold."
https://openalex.org/W2914878923,"Prostate cancer (PCa) initiation and progression requires activation of numerous oncogenic signaling pathways. Nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of oncogenic factors is mediated by Karyopherin proteins during cell transformation. However, the role of nuclear transporter proteins in PCa progression has not been well defined. Here, we report that the KPNB1, a key member of Karyopherin beta subunits, is highly expressed in advanced prostate cancers. Further study showed that targeting KPNB1 suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. The knockdown of KPNB1 reduced nuclear translocation of c-Myc, the expression of downstream cell cycle modulators, and phosphorylation of regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1), a key protein for spindle assembly during mitosis. Meanwhile, CHIP assay demonstrated the binding of c-Myc to KPNB1 promoter region, which indicated a positive feedback regulation of KPNB1 expression mediated by the c-Myc. In addition, NF-κB subunit p50 translocation to nuclei was blocked by KPNB1 inhibition, which led to an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in tumor sphere formation of PCa cells. Furthermore, subcutaneous xenograft tumor models with a stable knockdown of KPNB1 in C42B PCa cells validated that the inhibition of KPNB1 could suppress the growth of prostate tumor in vivo. Moreover, the intravenously administration of importazole, a specific inhibitor for KPNB1, effectively reduced PCa tumor size and weight in mice inoculated with PC3 PCa cells. In summary, our data established the functional link between KPNB1 and PCa prone c-Myc, NF-kB, and cell cycle modulators. More importantly, inhibition of KPNB1 could be a new therapeutic target for PCa treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2914085247,"Background Migrant women of non-English speaking background make up an increasing proportion of women giving birth in high income countries, such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of common physical and psychosocial health problems during pregnancy and up to 18 months postpartum among migrant women of non-English speaking background compared to Australian-born women. Methods Prospective pregnancy cohort study of 1507 nulliparous women. Women completed self-administered questionnaires or telephone interviews in early and late pregnancy and at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months postpartum. Standardised instruments were used to assess incontinence, depressive symptoms and intimate partner violence. Findings Migrant women of non-English speaking background (n = 243) and Australian-born mothers (n = 1115) reported a similar pattern of physical health problems during pregnancy and postpartum. The most common physical health problems were: exhaustion, back pain, constipation and urinary incontinence. Around one in six Australian-born women (16.9%) and more than one in four migrant women (22.5%) experienced intimate partner abuse in the first 12 months postpartum. Compared to Australian-born women, migrant women were more likely to report depressive symptoms at 12 and 18 months postpartum. Conclusion Physical and mental health problems are common among women of non-English speaking background and Australian-born women, and frequently persist up to 18 months postpartum. Migrant women experience a higher burden of postpartum depressive symptoms and intimate partner violence, and may face additional challenges accessing appropriate care and support."

https://openalex.org/W2911653534,"Both ecological theory and empirical evidence suggest that negative frequency dependent feedbacks structure plant communities, but integration of these findings has been limited. Here we develop a generic model of frequency dependent feedback to analyze coexistence and invasibility in random theoretical and real communities for which frequency dependence through plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) was determined empirically. We investigated community stability and invasibility by means of mechanistic analysis of invasion conditions and numerical simulations. We found that communities fall along a spectrum of coexistence types ranging from strict pair-wise negative feedback to strict intransitive networks. Intermediate community structures characterized by partial intransitivity may feature “keystone competitors” which disproportionately influence community stability. Real communities were characterized by stronger negative feedback and higher robustness to species loss than randomly assembled communities. Partial intransitivity became increasingly likely in more diverse communities. The results presented here theoretically explain why more diverse communities are characterized by stronger negative frequency dependent feedbacks, a pattern previously encountered in observational studies. Natural communities are more likely to be maintained by strict negative plant-soil feedback than expected by chance, but our results also show that community stability often depends on partial intransitivity. These results suggest that plant-soil feedbacks can facilitate coexistence in multi-species communities, but that these feedbacks may also initiate cascading effects on community diversity following from single-species loss."
https://openalex.org/W2950814981,"Accurate representation of subject-specific bone anatomy in lower-limb musculoskeletal models is important for human movement analyses and simulations. Mathematical methods can reconstruct geometric bone models using incomplete imaging of bone by morphing bone model templates, but the validity of these methods has not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal imaging requirements for accurate reconstruction of geometric bone models. Complete geometric pelvis and femur models of 14 healthy adults were reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging through segmentation. From each complete bone segmentation, three sets of incomplete segmentations (set 1 being the most incomplete) were created to test the effect of imaging incompleteness on reconstruction accuracy. Geometric bone models were reconstructed from complete sets, three incomplete sets, and two motion capture-based methods. Reconstructions from (in)complete sets were generated using statistical shape modelling, followed by host-mesh and local-mesh fitting through the Musculoskeletal Atlas Project Client. Reconstructions from motion capture-based methods used positional data from skin surface markers placed atop anatomic landmarks and estimated joint centre locations as target points for statistical shape modelling and linear scaling. Accuracy was evaluated with distance error (mm) and overlapping volume similarity (%) between complete bone segmentation and reconstructed bone models, and statistically compared using a repeated measure analysis of variance (p<0.05). Motion capture-based methods produced significantly higher distance error than reconstructions from (in)complete sets. Pelvis volume similarity reduced significantly with the level of incompleteness: complete set (92.70±1.92%), set 3 (85.41±1.99%), set 2 (81.22±3.03%), set 1 (62.30±6.17%), motion capture-based statistical shape modelling (41.18±9.54%), and motion capture-based linear scaling (26.80±7.19%). A similar trend was observed for femur volume similarity. Results indicate that imaging two relevant bone regions produces overlapping volume similarity >80% compared to complete segmented bone models, and improve analyses and simulation over current standard practice of linear scaling musculoskeletal models."

Although accurate preoperative diagnosis of nodal status may be helpful for treatment strategy, scant data about clinical values of lymph node size have been reported. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the relationship between lymph node size and lymph node metastasis.Participants comprised 102 patients who underwent rectal resection with total mesenteric excision or tumor-specific mesenteric excision and in some cases additional lateral pelvic lymph node dissection for rectal neuroendocrine tumor between June 2005 and September 2016. All lymph nodes from specimens were checked and measured.Pathological lymph node metastasis was confirmed in 37 patients (36%), including 6 patients (5.8%) with lateral pelvic lymph node metastasis. A total of 1169 lymph nodes in the mesorectum were retrieved from all specimens, with 78 lymph nodes (6.7%) showing metastasis. Mean length (long-axis diameter) of metastatic lymph nodes in the mesorectum was 4.31 mm, significantly larger than that of non-metastatic lymph nodes (2.39 mm, P<0.01). The optimal cut-off of major axis length for predicting mesorectal lymph node metastasis was 3 mm. We could predict lymph node metastasis in only 7 patients (21%) from preoperative multidetector-row computed tomography.Metastatic lymph nodes were small, so predicting lymph node metastasis from preoperative computed tomography is difficult. Alternative modalities with a scan width less than 3 mm may be needed to predict lymph node metastasis of rectal NET with low cost and labour requirements."

A newly extended LMDI method based on the Kaya identity was adopted to examine the main drivers for the carbon emissions increments both at the industrial sector and the residential sector. Research results are listed as follow: (1) Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou. (2) The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods, namely, the 10th five-year plan period (2003-2005), the 11th five-year plan period (2005-2010), and the 12th five-year plan period (2010-2013). The main reasons underlying these influencing mechanisms were different policy measures announced by the central and local government during the different five-year plan periods. (3) The affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving emissions increase, while the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), the economic structure effect (s-effect) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) were the main contributing factors suppressing emissions growth at the industrial sector. (4) The affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) was the most dominant positive driving factor on emissions increment, while the energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing emissions growth at the residential sector."
https://openalex.org/W2914568593,"Intradermal (i.d.) application of vaccine is promising way how to induce specific immune response against particular pathogens. Adjuvants, substances added into vaccination dose with the aim to increase immunogenicity, play important role in activation of dendritic cells with subsequent activation of lymphocytes. They can, however, induce unwanted local reactions. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of i.d. administration of model antigen keyhole limped hemocyanine alone or with different adjuvants–aluminium hydroxide and oil-based adjuvants—on local histopathological reaction as well as dendritic cell activation at the site of administration and local cytokine and chemokine response. This was assessed at 4 and 24 hours after application. Selection of the adjuvants was based on the fact, that they differently enhance antibody or cell-mediated immunity. The results showed activation of dendritic cells and both Th1 and Th2 response stimulated by oil-based adjuvants. It was associated with higher expression of set of genes, incl. chemokine receptor CCR7 or Th1-associated chemokine CXCL10 and cytokine IFNγ. Application of the antigen with aluminium hydroxide induced higher expression of Th2-associated IL4 or IL13. On the other hand, both complete and incomplete Freund´s adjuvants provoked strong local reaction associated with influx of neutrophils. This was accompanied with high expression of proinflammatory IL1 or neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL8. Surprisingly, similarly strong local reaction was detected also after application of aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant. The best balanced local reaction with sufficient activation of immune cells was detected after application of oil-based adjuvants Montanide and Emulsigen."

This acquisition scheme is limited by incomplete coverage of the left ventricle. We studied the feasibility of using radial simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) technique to achieve SA, 2-chamber and/or 4-chamber long-axis (2CH LA and/or 4CH LA) coverage with and without electrocardiography (ECG) gating using a motion-robust reconstruction framework.12 subjects were scanned at rest and/or stress, free breathing, with or without ECG gating. Multiple sets of radial SMS k-space were acquired within each cardiac cycle, and each SMS set sampled 3 parallel slices that were either SA, 2CH LA, or 4CH LA slices. The radial data was interpolated onto Cartesian space using an SMS GRAPPA operator gridding method. Self-gating and respiratory states binning of the data were done. The binning information as well as a pixel tracking spatiotemporal constrained reconstruction method were applied to obtain motion-robust image reconstructions. Reconstructions with and without the pixel tracking method were compared for signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio.Full coverage of the heart (at least 3 SA and 3 LA slices) during the first pass of contrast at every heartbeat was achieved by using the radial SMS acquisition. The proposed pixel tracking reconstruction improves the average SNR and CNR by 21% and 30% respectively, and reduces temporal blurring for both gated and ungated acquisitions.Acquiring simultaneous multi-slice SA, 2CH LA and/or 4CH LA myocardial perfusion images in every heartbeat is feasible in both gated and ungated acquisitions. This can add confidence when detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by revealing ischemia in different views, and by providing apical coverage that is improved relative to SA slices alone. The proposed pixel tracking framework improves the reconstruction while adding little computational cost."

Using seven sets of chemically diverse charged, polar, and nonpolar side chains, we performed cycles of artificial translation, in vitro selections for binding to either PCSK9 or IL-6 protein, and replication on libraries of random side chain-functionalized nucleic acid polymers. Polymer sequence convergence, bulk population target binding, affinity of individual polymers, and head-to-head competition among post-selection libraries collectively indicate that polymer libraries with nonpolar side chains outperformed libraries lacking these side chains. The presence of nonpolar groups, resembling functionality existing in proteins but missing from natural nucleic acids, thus may be strong determinants of binding activity. This factor may contribute to the apparent evolutionary advantage of proteins over their nucleic acid precursors for some molecular recognition tasks. A comprehensive analysis of the effect of the side chain composition of nucleic acid polymers revealed that the polarity of the side chains determines the performance of polymers during in vitro selections for protein binding."
https://openalex.org/W2949416633,"The mechanistic bases of thermal acclimation of net photosynthetic rate (An) are still difficult to discern, and the data sets available are scarce, particularly for hybrid poplar. In the present study, we examined the contribution of a number of biochemical and biophysical traits on thermal acclimation of An for two hybrid poplar clones. We grew cuttings of Populus maximowiczii × Populus nigra (M×N) and Populus maximowiczii × Populus balsamifera (M×B) clones under two day/night temperature of 23°C/18°C and 33°C /27°C and under low and high soil nitrogen level. After ten weeks, we measured leaf RuBisCO (RAR) and RuBisCO activase (RARCA) amounts and the temperature response of An, dark respiration (Rd), stomatal conductance, (gs), apparent maximum carboxylation rate of CO2 (Vcmax) and apparent photosynthetic electron transport rate (J). Results showed that a 10°C increase in growth temperature resulted in a shift in thermal optimum (Topt) of An of 6.2±1.6°C and 8.0±1.2°C for clone M×B and M×N respectively, and an increased An and gs at the growth temperature for clone M×B but not M×N. RuBisCO amount was increased by N level but was insensitive to growth temperature while RARCA amount and the ratio of its short to long isoform was stimulated by the warm condition for clone M×N and at low N for clone M×B. The activation energy of apparent Vcmax and apparent J decreased under the warm condition for clone M×B and remained unchanged for clone M×N. Our study demonstrated the involvement of both RARCA, the activation energy of apparent Vcmax and stomatal conductance in thermal acclimation of An."
https://openalex.org/W2911633910,"Background The burden of intellectual disabilities in low and middle income countries (LMIC) is high and is associated with parental psychological distress. There are few services for children and parents in most developing countries and few interventions have been created that target the psychological issues among parents of such children. This study aimed to develop a contextualized intervention to provide psychological support for parents of children with intellectual disabilities in an African setting. Methods Six steps were adopted from the Medical Research Council framework for designing complex interventions. This include: literature review of similar interventions and models, qualitative studies to gain insights of lived experiences of parents of such children, a consensus process with an expert panel of professionals working with children with disabilities and piloting and pre-testing the draft intervention for its acceptability and practicability in this settings. Results 21 intervention modules were found from a systematic search of the literature which were listed for possible use in our intervention along with four themes from our qualitative studies. An expert panel formed consensus on the eight most pertinent and relevant modules for our setting. This formed the intervention; “Titukulane.” This intervention was piloted and found to have high acceptability and practicability when contextualized in the field. Conclusion The use of a systematic framework for designing a complex intervention for supporting the mental health of parents of children with disabilities enables good acceptability and practicability for future use in low resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W2913763925,"Introduction and aims Improved sensitivity and efficiency of detection and quantification of carriage of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) in young people is important for evaluation of the impact of vaccines upon transmission and associated population-wide effects. Saliva collection is quick, non-invasive and facilitates frequent sampling, but has been reported to yield low sensitivity by culture. We re-evaluated this approach in a follow-up cross sectional study using direct and culture-amplified PCR. Material/Methods In April 2016 we collected paired oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and saliva samples from 1005 healthy students in Portugal into STGG broth and stored them at -80°C until DNA extraction and batched qPCR analysis. Samples were also cultured on GC agar plates for 72h and PCR done on DNA extracts from overall growth. Nm isolates were also sought from a selection of 50 samples. qPCR amplification targets were superoxide dismutase sodC and capsular locus/genogroup-specific genes (B, C, W, X and Y) and, for cultured isolates only, porA. Cycle threshold values of ≤36 were considered positive. Results 556 tests (460 samples, 363 subjects, 36.1%) were positive for Nm (sodC) and 65 (45, 36, 3.6%) for MenB. More salivas were positive by direct sodC qPCR (211, 21.0%) than OPS (126, 12.5%) but fewer were positive by culture-amplified qPCR (94 vs. 125). For both sample types, many that were negative on direct qPCR came positive on culture-amplification and Nm was consistently isolated from salivas in which culture amplified the PCR signal. Using both methods on both samples yielded 36.1% Nm and 5.5% encapsulated Nm carriage rates while direct qPCR on OPS alone detected 12.5% and 2.2%. Conclusions Detectable MenB carriage rates (2.9%) were lower than 4 years earlier (6.8%) in this population (p = 0.0003). Viable meningococci were often present in saliva. Although evidence of encapsulated Nm was less frequent in saliva than OPS, collection is more acceptable to subjects allowing more frequent sampling. Use of culture-amplification increases detection sensitivity in both sample types, especially when combined with direct PCR. Combining these samples and/or methodologies could greatly enhance the power of carriage studies to detect the impact of vaccines upon carriage and transmission."

However, little is known regarding CD carriage and transmission amongst asymptomatic colonizers. We evaluated carriage, characterized strains and examined epidemiologic linkages in asymptomatic colonized CD patients.Rectal swabs from asymptomatic patients admitted to the general medicine ward from April 1-June 30 2012 were collected. PCR-confirmed CD colonies were ribotyped and characterized by Modified-Multi Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MMLVA).1549-swabs were collected from 474-patients. Overall, 50/474(10.6%) were CD PCR-positive, 24/50 were colonized at admission, while 26/50 were first identified > = 72 hours after admission. Amongst the 50 CD PCR-positive patients, 90% were asymptomatically colonized and 80% of individuals carried toxigenic CD-strains, including ribotype-027 (5/45:11%). MMLVA revealed five-clusters involving 15-patients harboring toxigenic (4/5) and non-toxigenic CD strains (1/5). In two clusters, patients were CD positive on admission while in the other three clusters involving 10 patients, we observed CD transmission from asymptomatically colonized patients to 8 previously CD-negative patients.We identified increasing rates of colonization during admission to medical wards. MMLVA typing effectively discriminated between strains and suggests that 20% of patients with CD colonization acquired their strain(s) from asymptomatically colonized individuals in hospital."

Human limbal explants prepared from 17 corneoscleral rims were cultured with or without IL-13 (IL-13+ and IL-13-, respectively) and followed up to passage 2 (primary culture [P0]–P2). Cells were characterized by alcian blue/periodic acid–Schiff (AB/PAS) staining (goblet cells); immunofluorescent staining for p63α (progenitor cells), Ki-67 (proliferation), MUC5AC (mucin, goblet cells), and keratin 7 (K7, conjunctival epithelial and goblet cells); and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for expression of the p63α (TP63), MUC5AC, MUC4 (conjunctival mucins), K3, K12 (corneal epithelial cells), and K7 genes. Clonogenic ability was determined by colony-forming efficiency (CFE) assay. Using limbal explants, we generated epithelium with conjunctival phenotype and high viability in P0, P1, and P2 cultures under IL-13+ and IL-13- conditions, i.e., epithelium with strong K7 positivity, high K7 and MUC4 expression and the presence of goblet cells (AB/PAS and MUC5AC positivity; MUC5AC expression). p63α positivity was similar in IL-13+ and IL-13- cultures and was decreased in P2 cultures; however, there was increased TP63 expression in the presence of IL-13 (especially in the P1 cultures). Similarly, IL-13 increased proliferative activity in P1 cultures and significantly promoted P0 and P1 culture CFE. IL-13 did not increase goblet cell number in the P0–P2 cultures, nor did it influence MUC5AC and MUC4 expression. By harvesting unattached cells on day 1 of P1 we obtained goblet cell rich subpopulation showing AB/PAS, MUC5AC, and K7 positivity, but with no growth potential. In conclusion, limbal explants were successfully used to develop conjunctival epithelium with the presence of putative stem and goblet cells and with the ability to preserve the stemness of P0 and P1 cultures under IL-13 influence."
https://openalex.org/W2912046279,"In all organisms, DNA damage must be repaired quickly and properly, as it can be lethal for cells. Because eukaryotic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, the structural units of chromatin, chromatin modification is necessary during DNA damage repair and is achieved by histone modification and chromatin remodeling. Chromatin remodeling proteins therefore play important roles in the DNA damage response (DDR) by modifying the accessibility of DNA damage sites. Here, we show that mutation in a SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling protein (DDM1) causes hypersensitivity in the DNA damage response via defects in single-strand annealing (SSA) repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) as well as in the initial steps of homologous recombination (HR) repair. ddm1 mutants such as ddm1-1 and ddm1-2 exhibited increased root cell death and higher DSB frequency compared to the wild type after gamma irradiation. Although the DDM1 mutation did not affect the expression of most DDR genes, it did cause substantial decrease in the frequency of SSA as well as partial inhibition in the γ-H2AX and Rad51 induction, the initial steps of HR. Furthermore, global chromatin structure seemed to be affected by DDM1 mutations. These results suggest that DDM1 is involved in the homology directed repair such as SSA and HR, probably by modifying chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2912795195,"Purpose To quantify costs to patients of accessing HIV care prior to ART initiation. Materials and methods Using a cross-sectional study design, costs incurred by HIV-positive patients prior to ART initiation were estimated at urban primary healthcare facilities in South Africa. Costs included direct costs, indirect (productivity) costs, carer and coping costs (value of assets sold and money borrowed). The percentage of individual income spent on healthcare was calculated and compared by patient income tertiles and CD4 count strata. Results 289 patients (69% female, mean age 37 (SD: 10) years, median CD4 317 (IQR: 138–494) cells/mm3) were interviewed. The total mean monthly cost of pre-ART care was US$15.71. Indirect costs accounted for $2.59 (16.49%) of this when time was valued using the patient’s reported income. The mean monthly patient costs were $31.61, $12.78, $12.65 and $11.93 for those with a CD4 count <100, 101–350, 351–500 and >500 cells/mm3 respectively. The percentage of individual income spent on healthcare was 7.25% for those with a CD4 count <100 cells/mm3 and 4.05% for those with a CD4 count >500 cells/mm3. Conclusions Despite the provision of charge-free services at public clinics, care prior to ART initiation can be costly, particularly for the poor and unemployed. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence that highlights the need to consider policies to reduce the economic barriers to HIV service access, particularly for low income or unwell patient groups, such as improving access to disability grants."
https://openalex.org/W2912865932,"Background/aims Trachoma programs base treatment decisions on the community prevalence of the clinical signs of trachoma, assessed by direct examination of the conjunctiva. Automated assessment could be more standardized and more cost-effective. We tested the hypothesis that an automated algorithm could classify eyelid photographs better than chance. Methods A total of 1,656 field-collected conjunctival images were obtained from clinical trial participants in Niger and Ethiopia. Images were scored for trachomatous inflammation—follicular (TF) and trachomatous inflammation—intense (TI) according to the simplified World Health Organization grading system by expert raters. We developed an automated procedure for image enhancement followed by application of a convolutional neural net classifier for TF and separately for TI. One hundred images were selected for testing TF and TI, and these images were not used for training. Results The agreement score for TF and TI tasks for the automated algorithm relative to expert graders was κ = 0.44 (95% CI: 0.26 to 0.62, P < 0.001) and κ = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.84, P < 0.001), respectively. Discussion For assessing the clinical signs of trachoma, a convolutional neural net performed well above chance when tested against expert consensus. Further improvements in specificity may render this method suitable for field use."

https://openalex.org/W2912466573,"The role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and autophagy in gastric cancer is not clear. We determined H. pylori infection status of the subjects and investigated the expression of MIF and autophagy markers (Atg5, LC3A and LC3B) in human gastric tissue at baseline. Then H. pylori eradication was done for H. pylori positive patients and MIF and Atg5 levels were investigated on each follow-up for both H. pylori-eradicated and H. pylori negative patients. Baseline tissue mRNA expression of MIF, Atg5, LC3A and LC3B was measured by real-time PCR in 453 patients (control 165, gastric dysplasia 82, and gastric cancer 206). Three hundred three patients (66.9%) had H. pylori infection at the time of enrollment. Only within H. pylori-positive group, MIF level was significantly elevated in patients with cancer than in control or dysplasia groups (P<0.05). LC3A and LC3B levels also showed significant differences within H. pylori-positive subgroups. H. pylori-positive dysplasia subgroup showed significantly lower (LC3A) (P<0.05) and higher (LC3B) mRNA levels (P<0.05) than in other subgroups. On follow-up, within H. pylori-eradicated group, Atg5 expression increased sequentially from control to dysplasia and cancer subgroups. Multiple linear regression showed autophagy markers (LC3A, LC3B, and Atg5) directly predicted MIF level (adjusted R2 = 0.492, P<0.001). Serial follow-up showed longitudinal increase in Atg5 level in general, with constantly higher levels in H. pylori-eradicated group than in -negative group. Intestinal metaplasia (IM) group initially showed higher Atg5 expression than the IM-negative group. However, it was reversed between the groups eventually because of the lower rate of increase in IM group. These results suggest a role of MIF and autophagy markers and their interaction in H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2913471332,"Sustained reliance on androgen receptor (AR) after failure of AR-targeting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) prevents effective treatment of castration-recurrent (CR) prostate cancer (CaP). Interfering with the molecular machinery by which AR drives CaP progression may be an alternative therapeutic strategy but its feasibility remains to be tested. Here, we explore targeting the mechanism by which AR, via RhoA, conveys androgen-responsiveness to serum response factor (SRF), which controls aggressive CaP behavior and is maintained in CR-CaP. Following a siRNA screen and candidate gene approach, RNA-Seq studies confirmed that the RhoA effector Protein Kinase N1 (PKN1) transduces androgen-responsiveness to SRF. Androgen treatment induced SRF-PKN1 interaction, and PKN1 knockdown or overexpression severely impaired or stimulated, respectively, androgen regulation of SRF target genes. PKN1 overexpression occurred during clinical CR-CaP progression, and hastened CaP growth and shortened CR-CaP survival in orthotopic CaP xenografts. PKN1’s effects on SRF relied on its kinase domain. The multikinase inhibitor lestaurtinib inhibited PKN1 action and preferentially affected androgen regulation of SRF over direct AR target genes. In a CR-CaP patient-derived xenograft, expression of SRF target genes was maintained while AR target gene expression declined and proliferative gene expression increased. PKN1 inhibition decreased viability of CaP cells before and after ADT. In patient-derived CaP explants, lestaurtinib increased AR target gene expression but did not significantly alter SRF target gene or proliferative gene expression. These results provide proof-of-principle for selective forms of ADT that preferentially target different fractions of AR’s transcriptional output to inhibit CaP growth."
https://openalex.org/W2914179287,"Depression is one of the most common and important neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson’s disease and often becomes worse as Parkinson’s disease progresses. However, the underlying mechanisms of depression in Parkinson’s disease are not clear. The aim of our study was to find genetic features related to depression in Parkinson’s disease using an imaging genetics approach and to construct an analytical model for predicting the degree of depression in Parkinson’s disease. The neuroimaging and genotyping data were obtained from an openly accessible database. We computed imaging features through connectivity analysis derived from tractography of diffusion tensor imaging. The imaging features were used as intermediate phenotypes to identify genetic variants according to the imaging genetics approach. We then constructed a linear regression model using the genetic features from imaging genetics approach to describe clinical scores indicating the degree of depression. As a comparison, we constructed other models using imaging features and genetic features based on references to demonstrate the effectiveness of our imaging genetics model. The models were trained and tested in a five-fold cross-validation. The imaging genetics approach identified several brain regions and genes known to be involved in depression, with the potential to be used as meaningful biomarkers. Our proposed model using imaging genetic features predicted and explained the degree of depression in Parkinson’s disease appropriately (adjusted R2 larger than 0.6 over five training folds) and with a lower error and higher correlation than with other models over five test folds."

However, incomplete penetrance, variable expressivity, and phenotypic overlap make the morphometric identification of these species difficult. In this study, partial sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) genes have been analyzed in Chaceon species from the Eastern Central and South Atlantic and compared with sequences of species from Western Atlantic. Our results corroborate the proposed morphological species and highlight the significant separation of the Eastern Atlantic species and those from Atlantic coasts of South America for both markers (97% Bayesian posterior probability, BPP / 83% Bootstrap replicates, BT). Interestingly, Chaceon sanctaehelenae shows a closer relationship with the species of the American coast than with those from the Eastern Atlantic. On the other hand, while COI marker clearly separates Chaceon atopus and Chaceon erytheiae species (99 BPP / 91% BT), these species share haplotypes for the 16S rRNA marker, pointing to a recent speciation process. Moreover, a close relationship was observed between Chaceon maritae and Chaceon affinis (94% BPP / 77% BT). The topologies of the trees obtained indicate that the ancestor of this genus was closer related to those species from South America than to those from the Eastern Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W2912602358,"The cardiovascular biology of proton radiotherapy is not well understood. We aimed to compare the genomic dose-response to proton and gamma radiation of the mouse aorta to assess whether their vascular effects may diverge. We performed comparative RNA sequencing of the aorta following (4 hrs) total-body proton and gamma irradiation (0.5-200 cGy whole body dose, 10 dose levels) of conscious mice. A trend analysis identified genes that showed a dose response. While fewer genes were dose-responsive to proton than gamma radiation (29 vs. 194 genes; q-value ≤ 0.1), the magnitude of the effect was greater. Highly responsive genes were enriched for radiation response pathways (DNA damage, apoptosis, cellular stress and inflammation; p-value ≤ 0.01). Gamma, but not proton radiation induced additionally genes in vasculature specific pathways. Genes responsive to both radiation types showed almost perfectly superimposable dose-response relationships. Despite the activation of canonical radiation response pathways by both radiation types, we detected marked differences in the genomic response of the murine aorta. Models of cardiovascular risk based on photon radiation may not accurately predict the risk associated with proton radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2914220415,"To evaluate the mortality risk in the HIV-positive population, we conducted an observational cohort study involving routine data collection of HIV-positive patients who presented at HIV clinics and multiple treatment centers throughout Guangxi province, Southern China in 2011. The patients were screened for tuberculosis (TB) and tested for hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infections yearly. Following the registration, the cohort was followed up for a 60-month period till the end-point (December 31, 2015). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for mortality after adjusting for confounding factors stratified by patients' sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. HRs were compared within risk-factor levels. With the median follow-up of 3.7-person years for each individual, 5,398 (37.8%) (of 14,293 patients with HIV/AIDS) died; among whom, 78.4% were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve; 43.6% presented late; and 12.2% and 3.3% of patients had Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and HBV and HCV co-infection, respectively. Of individuals with CD4 counts, those with CD4 count >350 cells/μL formed 14.0% of those who died. Furthermore, gender [multivariable HR (95% CI):1.94 (1.68-2.25)], Han ethnicity [2.15 (1.07-4.32)], illiteracy [3.28 (1.96-5.5)], elementary education [2.91 (1.8-4.72)], late presentation [2.89 (2.46-3.39)], and MTB co-infection [1.28 (1.10-1.49)] strongly increased the all-cause mortality risk of HIV-positive individuals. The HR for ART-based stratification was 0.08 (0.07-0.09); and for HBV and HCV co-infection, HR was 1.02 (0.86-1.21). The findings emphasized that accessibility to HIV testing among high-risk populations and screening for viral hepatitis and TB co-infection are important for the survival of HIV-positive individuals. Initiating early ART, even for individuals with higher CD4 counts, is advisable to help increase the prolongation of lives within the community."
https://openalex.org/W2912657171,"Whereas native lung overinflation has been thought to happen in recipients of single lung transplantation for lymphangioleiomyomatosis because of its increased compliance, there is no study that has reported the details on the change of the native lung volume after single lung transplantation by three-dimensional computed tomography volumetry. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the lung volume after single lung transplantation for lymphangioleiomyomatosis by three-dimensional computed tomography volumetry and investigate the correlation between the native lung volume change and postoperative pulmonary function.We retrospectively reviewed the data of 17 patients who underwent single lung transplantation for lymphangioleiomyomatosis. We defined the ratio of the native lung volume to total lung volume (N/T ratio) as an indicator of overinflation of the native lung. In order to assess changes in the N/T ratio over time, we calculated the rate of change in the N/T ratio which is standardized by the N/T ratio at 1 year after single lung transplantation: rate of change in N/T ratio (%) = {(N/T ratio at a certain year)/(N/T ratio at 1 year)- 1}× 100.We investigated the correlations between the N/T ratio and the pulmonary function test parameters at 1 year and 5 years; however, there was no significant correlation between them. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between the rate of change in the N/T ratio and that in forced expiratory volume in 1 second %predicted (%FEV1) at 5 years after single lung transplantation.The single lung transplantation recipients for lymphangioleiomyomatosis showed increased rate of change in the N/T ratio in the long-time course after lung transplantation with the decrease of %FEV1. We expect that these cases will probably cause the overinflation of the native lung in the future."
