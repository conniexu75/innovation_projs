https://openalex.org/W3193419934,"Immune responses to cancer are highly variable, with mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) tumors exhibiting more anti-tumor immunity than mismatch repair-proficient (MMRp) tumors. To understand the rules governing these varied responses, we transcriptionally profiled 371,223 cells from colorectal tumors and adjacent normal tissues of 28 MMRp and 34 MMRd individuals. Analysis of 88 cell subsets and their 204 associated gene expression programs revealed extensive transcriptional and spatial remodeling across tumors. To discover hubs of interacting malignant and immune cells, we identified expression programs in different cell types that co-varied across tumors from affected individuals and used spatial profiling to localize coordinated programs. We discovered a myeloid cell-attracting hub at the tumor-luminal interface associated with tissue damage and an MMRd-enriched immune hub within the tumor, with activated T cells together with malignant and myeloid cells expressing T cell-attracting chemokines. By identifying interacting cellular programs, we reveal the logic underlying spatially organized immune-malignant cell networks."

Here, we found that Grn–/– mice exhibit a global deficiency in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), an endolysosomal phospholipid we identified as a pH-dependent PGRN interactor as well as a redox-sensitive enhancer of lysosomal proteolysis and lipolysis. Grn–/– brains also showed an age-dependent, secondary storage of glucocerebrosidase substrate glucosylsphingosine. We investigated a protein replacement strategy by engineering protein transport vehicle (PTV):PGRN—a recombinant protein linking PGRN to a modified Fc domain that binds human transferrin receptor for enhanced CNS biodistribution. PTV:PGRN rescued various Grn–/– phenotypes in primary murine macrophages and human iPSC-derived microglia, including oxidative stress, lysosomal dysfunction, and endomembrane damage. Peripherally delivered PTV:PGRN corrected levels of BMP, glucosylsphingosine, and disease pathology in Grn–/– CNS, including microgliosis, lipofuscinosis, and neuronal damage. PTV:PGRN thus represents a potential biotherapeutic for GRN-FTD.

GRN frontotemporal dementia (GRN-FTD) represents 10%–15% of FTD cases and is characterized by lipofuscinosis, microgliosis, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, and cortical neuronal loss (Kao et al., 2017Kao A.W.

Most heterozygous GRN-FTD mutations result in haploinsufficiency of progranulin (PGRN), while various missense or nonsense mutations in a subset of cases cause PGRN loss of function (LoF) (Baker et al., 2006Baker M.

Rare homozygous GRN mutations lead to a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) termed neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) (Smith et al., 2012Smith K.R. Damiano J. Franceschetti S. Carpenter S.

Lipofuscin, a lysosomal pathology caused by oxidative stress, is also found in the brain and retina of GRN-FTD patients, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms with NCL (Ward et al., 2017Ward M.E.

Along with data showing a sortilin-dependent lysosomal localization of PGRN (Hu et al., 2010Hu F. Padukkavidana T. Vægter C.B. Brady O.A. Zheng Y. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H.H. Nykjaer A.

PGRN is processed intracellularly by CatB and CatL into seven ∼6 kDa granulin (GRN) peptides that may mediate its lysosomal functions (Holler et al., 2017Holler C.J. Taylor G. Deng Q. Kukar T.

Given that key lysosomal PGRN interactors—CatD, prosaposin, GCase—are genetically linked to neurodegeneration, defects in lysosomal functions of PGRN or GRN peptides likely underlie pathogenic mechanisms in GRN-FTD and NCL. This is corroborated by findings that a modifier of GRN-FTD age of onset is TMEM106B (Cruchaga et al., 2011Cruchaga C. Graff C. Chiang H.H. Wang J. Hinrichs A.L. Spiegel N. Bertelsen S. Mayo K.

Because lipofuscinosis is also a feature of PGRN-deficient neurons (Kao et al., 2017Kao A.W. McKay A. Singh P.P. Brunet A. Huang E.J.

Since GRN-FTD results from PGRN deficiency, a potentially attractive therapeutic strategy is a CNS-penetrant PGRN replacement therapy. Here, we capitalized on recently engineered transport vehicles (TVs) that enable receptor-mediated transcytosis of large molecules across endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by binding to the human transferrin receptor apical domain (huTfR) (Kariolis et al., 2020Kariolis M.S.

Med. 2020; 12: eaay1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We fused a TV to recombinant human PGRN, termed protein transport vehicle (PTV):PGRN, to assess efficacy in correcting Grn LoF-associated phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Our results uncover a relationship between PGRN and lysosomal lipid metabolism by defining the PGRN deficiency model as an atypical LSD associated with a deficiency of the lysosomal lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), leading to a secondary storage of GCase substrates. Importantly, our data show PTV:PGRN rescues a range of lysosomal defects, including BMP deficiency, GCase substrate accumulation, lysosomal vacuolization and endomembrane damage, as well as inflammation and neuronal damage. Our data provide a pre-clinical proof of concept supporting the use of PTV:PGRN for treatment of GRN-FTD. Previous liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) studies have shown lipid metabolism is altered in various Grn–/– models (Evers et al., 2017Evers B.M. Rodriguez-Navas C. Tesla R.J.

However, lipid panels previously assessed were limited in coverage of glycosphingolipids and other lipids often dysregulated in LSDs, such as BMP (also known as lysobisphosphatidic acid). To determine whether Grn LoF is associated with profiles suggestive of LSDs, we performed targeted lipidomics and metabolomics on young (2 month) and old (13 month) Grn+/+ and Grn–/– mouse brain with LCMS. We selected Grn–/– rather than Grn+/– models, as they best replicate the GRN-FTD pathologies (Kao et al., 2017Kao A.W. McKay A. Singh P.P. Brunet A. Huang E.J. Progranulin, lysosomal regulation and neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found a decrease in various BMP species including BMP(22:6/22:6) and BMP(18:1/18:1) as the largest genotype-dependent changes (Figures 1A–1D). This anionic phospholipid is enriched in late endosomes/lysosomes, where it is believed to stimulate lysosomal lipases and cholesterol egress into the cytosol (Breiden and Sandhoff, 2020Breiden B.

BMP showed an age effect but no age-genotype interaction (Figures 1C and 1D). Conversely, there was a genotype- and age-dependent increase in brain levels of glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), a GCase substrate (Dai et al., 2016Dai M. Liou B. Swope B. Wang X. Zhang W. Inskeep V.

Consistent with GCase substrate accumulation, Grn–/– brain showed a decrease in GCase activity, but only at 13 months (Figure 1F). Grn–/– plasma, liver, and urine also revealed a decrease in one or more BMP species, while Grn–/– plasma and liver exhibited a GlcSph increase (Figures S1A–S1C). Overall, these data establish BMP deficiency and GlcSph accumulation as defining molecular features of Grn–/– mice and point to lysosomal dysfunction.Figure S1GRN-FTD patients’ biofluids show reduced PGRN, increased Nf-L, and aberrant lysosomal lipids, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A-C) Volcano plot visualization of lipids and metabolites elevated (orange) or reduced (blue) in tissues and fluids from 6mo.

https://openalex.org/W3195308249,"Executing memory-guided behavior requires storage of information about experience and later recall of that information to inform choices. Awake hippocampal replay, when hippocampal neural ensembles briefly reactivate a representation related to prior experience, has been proposed to critically contribute to these memory-related processes. However, it remains unclear whether awake replay contributes to memory function by promoting the storage of past experiences, facilitating planning based on evaluation of those experiences, or both. We designed a dynamic spatial task that promotes replay before a memory-based choice and assessed how the content of replay related to past and future behavior. We found that replay content was decoupled from subsequent choice and instead was enriched for representations of previously rewarded locations and places that had not been visited recently, indicating a role in memory storage rather than in directly guiding subsequent behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3194144433,"The electron transport chain promotes aspartate synthesis, which is required for cancer cell proliferation. However, it is unclear whether aspartate is limiting in normal stem cells. We found that mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) depend entirely on cell-autonomous aspartate synthesis, which increases upon HSC activation. Overexpression of the glutamate/aspartate transporter, Glast, or deletion of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (Got1) each increased aspartate levels in HSCs/progenitor cells and increased the function of HSCs but not colony-forming progenitors. Conversely, deletion of Got2 reduced aspartate levels and the function of HSCs but not colony-forming progenitors. Deletion of Got1 and Got2 eliminated HSCs. Isotope tracing showed aspartate was used to synthesize asparagine and purines. Both contributed to increased HSC function as deletion of asparagine synthetase or treatment with 6-mercaptopurine attenuated the increased function of GLAST-overexpressing HSCs. HSC function is thus limited by aspartate, purine, and asparagine availability during hematopoietic regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W3193667390,"Viral sepsis has been proposed as an accurate term to describe all multisystemic dysregulations and clinical findings in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. The adoption of this term may help the implementation of more accurate strategies of early diagnosis, prognosis, and in-hospital treatment. We accurately quantified 110 metabolites using targeted metabolomics, and 13 cytokines/chemokines in plasma samples of 121 COVID-19 patients with different levels of severity, and 37 non-COVID-19 individuals. Analyses revealed an integrated host-dependent dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil activation chemokines, glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, amino acid metabolism, polyamine synthesis, and lipid metabolism typical of sepsis processes distinctive of a mild disease. Dysregulated metabolites and cytokines/chemokines showed differential correlation patterns in mild and critically ill patients, indicating a crosstalk between metabolism and hyperinflammation. Using multivariate analysis, powerful models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 induced sepsis were generated, as well as for mortality prediction among septic patients. A metabolite panel made of kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, IL-6, LysoPC a C18:2, and phenylalanine discriminated non-COVID-19 from sepsis patients with an area under the curve (AUC (95%CI)) of 0.991 (0.986-0.995), with sensitivity of 0.978 (0.963-0.992) and specificity of 0.920 (0.890-0.949). The panel that included C10:2, IL-6, NLR, and C5 discriminated mild patients from sepsis patients with an AUC (95%CI) of 0.965 (0.952-0.977), with sensitivity of 0.993(0.984-1.000) and specificity of 0.851 (0.815-0.887). The panel with citric acid, LysoPC a C28:1, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and kynurenine/tryptophan ratio discriminated severe patients from sepsis patients with an AUC (95%CI) of 0.829 (0.800-0.858), with sensitivity of 0.738 (0.695-0.781) and specificity of 0.781 (0.735-0.827). Septic patients who survived were different from those that did not survive with a model consisting of hippuric acid, along with the presence of Type II diabetes, with an AUC (95%CI) of 0.831 (0.788-0.874), with sensitivity of 0.765 (0.697-0.832) and specificity of 0.817 (0.770-0.865)."

This research intended to elucidate whether circulating NETs are associated with t-PA resistance and the underlying mechanism. The levels of NETs were detected in the circulating neutrophils, ischemic brain tissue of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients, and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) models. NET formation in blood, thrombi, and ischemic brain tissue of mice were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) was assessed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Procoagulant activity (PCA) was evaluated using fibrin formation assays, thrombin, and purified coagulation complex. The plasma levels of NETs in AIS patients were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals. After thrombolysis, a significant increase was noted in NET markers in no-improvement patients, while the changes in improvement patients were not significant. Importantly, NETs were decorated with von Willebrand factor (vWF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the blood and thrombi, which could reverse the fibrinolytic effects. In addition, NETs activated platelets (PLTs) and endothelial cells (ECs), stimulating a procoagulant phenotype and facilitating vWF and PAI-1 release. DNase I, activated protein C (APC), and sivelestat markedly inhibited these effects. Furthermore, targeting NETs protected mice from tMCAO-induced cerebral ischemia, possibly by regulating vWF and PAI-1. In summary, NETs may contribute to t-PA resistance in AIS through activation of PLTs and ECs. Strategies against NETs may present a promising therapeutic approach to improve the thrombolysis efficiency of t-PA in AIS patients."

However, the gene regulatory and phenotypic effects of altering a miRNA's in vivo abundance (rather than its binary gain or loss) are not well understood. By genetic combination, we generated an allelic series of mice expressing varying levels of miR-218, a motor neuron-selective gene regulator associated with motor neuron disease. Titration of miR-218 cellular dose unexpectedly revealed complex, non-ratiometric target mRNA dose responses and distinct gene network outputs. A non-linearly responsive regulon exhibited a steep miR-218 dose-dependent threshold in repression that, when crossed, resulted in severe motor neuron synaptic failure and death. This work demonstrates that a miRNA can govern distinct gene network outputs at different expression levels and that miRNA-dependent phenotypes emerge at particular dose ranges because of hidden regulatory inflection points of their underlying gene networks."
https://openalex.org/W3193479599,"GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene has been shown to cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Dipeptide repeat proteins produced through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation are recognized as potential drivers for neurodegeneration. Therefore, selective inhibition of RAN translation could be a therapeutic avenue to treat these neurodegenerative diseases. It was previously known that the porphyrin TMPyP4 binds to G4C2 repeat RNA. However, the consequences of this interaction have not been well characterized. Here, we confirmed that TMPyP4 inhibits C9orf72 G4C2 repeat translation in cellular and in in vitro translation systems. An artificial insertion of an AUG codon failed to cancel the translation inhibition, suggesting that TMPyP4 acts downstream of non-AUG translation initiation. Polysome profiling assays also revealed polysome retention on G4C2 repeat RNA, along with inhibition of translation, indicating that elongating ribosomes stall on G4C2 repeat RNA. Urea-resistant interaction between G4C2 repeat RNA and TMPyP4 likely contributes to this ribosome stalling and thus to selective inhibition of RAN translation. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mode of action of TMPyP4 as an inhibitor of G4C2 repeat translation elongation."

This study tried to explore the demographic and treatment outcome differences between the elderly (aged 60 years and above) and non-elderly TB (<60 years) patients from South India. This study was part of a large ongoing cohort study under the RePORT India consortium. Newly diagnosed TB patients recruited into the cohort between 2014 and 2018 were included in this study. Pretested and standardized questionnaire and tools were used to collect data and were stored securely for the entire cohort. Required demographic, anthropometric and treatment related variables were extracted from this database and analyzed using Stata version 14.0. Prevalence of elderly TB was summarized as percentage with 95% confidence interval (CI). Generalized linear modelling was attempted to find the factors associated with elderly TB. A total of 1,259 eligible TB patients were included into this present study. Mean (SD) of the participants in the elderly and non-elderly group was 65.8 (6.2) and 40.2 (12.0) respectively. Prevalence of elderly TB was 15.6% (95%CI: 13.6%-17.6%) with nearly 71% belonging to 60-69 age category. Male sex, OBC caste, poor education, unemployment, marriage, alcohol consumption and unable to work as per Karnofsky score were found to be significantly associated with an increased prevalence of elderly TB. Unfavorable outcomes (12% vs 6.5%, p value: 0.018), including death (9.3% vs 3.4%, p value: 0.001) were significantly higher among the elderly group when compared to their non-elderly counterparts. The current TB programme should have strategies to maintain follow up with due attention to adverse effects, social support and outcomes. Additional research should focus on predictors for unfavorable outcomes among the elderly TB group and explore ways to handle the same. Rendering adequate social support from the health system side and family side would be a good start."

Our objective was to evaluate its clinical value and associations. Methods Blood counts, inflammatory markers and clinical parameters were measured in patients with and those screened for tuberculosis. Complete blood counts (CBCs) from a multi-ethnic population aged 16 to 65 years were evaluated; a sub-group with normal hematological indices was used to define the range of MLRs. Results Multivariate analysis in proven tuberculosis (n = 264) indicated MLR associated with low serum albumin, high white cell counts and a positive culture; values were higher in sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (S+PTB). Analysis in S+PTB (n = 296) showed higher MLRs in males and those with high neutrophil counts, low serum albumin and high C-reactive protein. The diagnostic value of MLRs was assessed by comparing notified patients with TB (n = 264) with denotified cases (n = 50), active case-finding in non-contacts (TB n = 111 and LTBI n = 373) and contacts of S+PTB (n = 149) with S+PTB found at screening (n = 75). Sensitivities and specificities ranged from 58.0–62.5% and 50.0–70.0% respectively for optimal cut-off values, defined by ROC curves. In CBCs obtained over one month, ratios correlated with neutrophil counts (ρ = 0.48, P&lt;0.00001, n = 14,573; MLR = 0.45 at 8–8.9 x 10 9 /L) and were higher in males than females (P&lt;0.0001). The MLR range (mean ± 2SD) in those with normal hematological indices (n = 3921: females 0.122–0.474; males 0.136–0.505) paralleled LTBI MLRs. Ratios did not predict death (n = 29) nor response to treatment (n = 178 S+PTB with follow-up CBCs). Ratios were higher in males than female in the 16–45 years age group, where immune differences due to sex hormones are likely greatest. Conclusions Severe tuberculosis and male sex associated with high MLRs; the same variables likely affect the performance of other biomarkers. The ratio performed poorly as a clinical aid."
https://openalex.org/W3195196388,"Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the three major diseases affecting rice production and quality; it reduces rice grain yield by nearly 30%. In the early stage of this study, a strain of Bacillus velezensis with strong inhibition of M. oryzae was isolated and named ZW10. In vitro assays indicated prolonged germination time of conidia of M. oryzae treated with the antifungal substances of ZW10, 78% of the conidia could not form appressorium, and the conidial tubes expanded to form vacuolar structure and then shrank. The results of FDA-PI composite dyes showed that the antifungal substances of ZW10 inhibited the normal activity of M. oryzae hyphae that were rarely able to infect the epidermal cells of rice leaf sheath in vivo tests. In addition, rice treated with the antifungal substances of ZW10 showed a variety of defense responses, including activation of defense-related enzymes, increased expression of the salicylic acid pathway genes, and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which might function directly or indirectly in resistance to pathogen attack. The field experiment with rice blast infection in different periods showed that the antifungal substances of ZW10 had the same control effect as carbendazim. The significant biological control activity of ZW10 and its capacity to stimulate host defenses suggest that this B. velezensis strain has the potential to be developed into a biopesticide for the biocontrol of rice blast."
https://openalex.org/W3197633157,"The human adaptive immune system must generate extraordinary diversity to be able to respond to all possible pathogens. The T-cell repertoire derives this high diversity through somatic recombination of the T-cell receptor (TCR) locus, a random process that results in repertoires that are largely private to each individual. However, factors such as thymic selection and T-cell proliferation upon antigen exposure can affect TCR sharing among individuals. By immunosequencing the TCRβ variable region of 426 healthy individuals, we find that, on average, fewer than 1% of TCRβ clones are shared between individuals, consistent with largely private TCRβ repertoires. However, we detect a significant correlation between increased HLA allele sharing and increased number of shared TCRβ clones, with each additional shared HLA allele contributing to an increase in ~0.01% of the total shared TCRβ clones, supporting a key role for HLA type in shaping the immune repertoire. Surprisingly, we find that shared antigen exposure to CMV leads to fewer shared TCRβ clones, even after controlling for HLA, indicative of a largely private response to major viral antigenic exposure. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that increased age is correlated with decreased overall TCRβ clone sharing, indicating that the pattern of private TCRβ clonal expansion is a general feature of the T-cell response to other infectious antigens as well. However, increased age also correlates with increased sharing among the lowest frequency clones, consistent with decreased repertoire diversity in older individuals. Together, all of these factors contribute to shaping the TCRβ repertoire, and understanding their interplay has important implications for the use of T cells for therapeutics and diagnostics."

In order to accomplish this goal, internally consistent and externally valid indicators of animal welfare are necessary to advance our understanding of the current welfare status of individual animals. Historically, efforts have focused on monitoring visible or observable signs of poor health or problem behavior, but lack of signs or problems does not necessarily demonstrate that an individual animal is thriving. The current study examined fecal hormone metabolite levels and behavior for two species of bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus and Tursiops aduncus ) from 25 different accredited zoological facilities. At the time of the study, all facilities were accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. This was part of the multi-institutional study ‘Towards understanding of the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums” commonly referred to as the Cetacean Welfare Study. Behavioral diversity was calculated using the Shannon Diversity Index on species-appropriate behavioral events. Behavioral diversity was compared to the fecal metabolites of cortisol, aldosterone, and the ratio of cortisol to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as the stereotypic behavior of route tracing. Similar to previous studies on other species, there was a significant inverse relationship between behavioral diversity and both fecal cortisol metabolites and route tracing. Additionally, a significant inverse relationship also exists between behavioral diversity and the ratio of fecal cortisol to DHEA metabolites. Behavioral diversity and fecal aldosterone metabolites were not associated. Additional research is still needed to validate behavioral diversity as an indicator of positive animal welfare for bottlenose dolphins and across species. However, based on current results, facilities could utilize behavioral diversity combined with other measures of welfare to more comprehensively evaluate the welfare of bottlenose dolphins."

However, knowledge of the cellular transition from white adipose tissue (WAT) to BAT is still limited. In this study, we provided a comprehensive metabolomics and transcriptional signatures of goat BAT and WAT. A total of 157 metabolites were significantly changed, including 81 upregulated and 76 downregulated metabolites. In addition, we identified the citric acid cycle, fatty acid elongation, and degradation pathways as coordinately activated in BAT. Interestingly, five unsaturated fatty acids (Eicosadienoic Acid, C20:2; γ-Linolenic acid, C20:3; Arachidonic Acid, C20:4; Adrenic acid, C22:4; Docosahexaenoic acid, C22:6), Succinate, L-carnitine, and L-palmitoyl-carnitine were found to be abundant in BAT. Furthermore, L-carnitine, an intermediate of fatty acid degradation, is required for goat brown adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis through activating AMPK pathway. However, L-carnitine decreased lipid accumulation through inducing lipolysis and thermogenesis in white adipocytes. These results revealed that there are the significant alterations in transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles between goat WAT and BAT, which may contribute to better understanding the roles of metabolites in BAT thermogenesis process."
https://openalex.org/W3197974159,"In recent decades, animal welfare science has evolved to utilize a multidisciplinary approach to assess the welfare of animals in accredited zoos and aquariums. Science-based animal welfare assessments have become an essential component of management programs and widespread application is expected by animal care professionals. Management practices for bottlenose dolphins in accredited facilities incorporate several programs that potentially impact animal welfare including environmental enrichment and animal training. Additionally, habitat characteristics, such as the dimensions of the habitat, have been proposed to affect welfare. While accredited facilities are required to meet high standards of care, habitat characteristics and management practices are not standardized across locations. Knowledge and subsequent application of these practices and habitat characteristics can enhance our understanding of factors associated with positive welfare. As part of a larger study of dolphin welfare titled “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums” (colloquially called the Cetacean Welfare Study), survey data were collected from 86 bottlenose dolphins in 40 habitats at 38 facilities in seven countries. The major aims of this paper are to provide general descriptive information regarding dolphin management in accredited zoos and aquariums and to provide supplemental context to the other research published from the Cetacean Welfare Study data set. This paper provides a review of current habitat characteristics and management practices at those 38 accredited zoos and aquariums. These data enabled the identification and quantification of how cetacean management practices differed between participating facilities accredited by the Alliance for Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums. Variables were selected based on their potential association with welfare including the physical habitat, environmental enrichment, and training programs. The variables were also used for subsequent research in this collection of related papers to investigate important connections between potential indicators of welfare and habitat characteristics, environmental enrichment, and training programs."

To objectively investigate sickness behavior along with its pain-like behaviors in LPS-treated mice, the behavioral measurement requires accurate methods, which reflects clinical relevance. While reflexive pain response tests have been used for decades for pain assessment, its accuracy and clinical relevance remain problematic. Hence, we used automated home-cage monitoring LABORAS to evaluate spontaneous locomotive behaviors in LPS-induced mice. LPS-treated mice displayed sickness behaviors including pain-like behaviors in automated home-cage monitoring characterized by decreased mobile behaviors (climbing, locomotion, rearing) and increased immobility compared to that of the control group in both short- and long-term locomotive assessments. Here, in short-term measurement, both in the open-field test and automated home-cage monitoring, mice demonstrated impaired locomotive behaviors. We also assessed 24 h long-term locomotor activity in the home-cage system, which profiled the diurnal behaviors of LPS-stimulated mice. The results demonstrated significant behavioral impairment in LPS-stimulated mice compared to the control mice in both light and dark phases. However, the difference is more evident in the dark phase compared to the light phase owing to the nocturnal activity of mice. In addition, the administration of indomethacin as a pharmacological intervention improved sickness behaviors in the open-field test as well as automated home-cage monitoring, confirming that automated home-cage monitoring could be potentially useful in pharmacological screening. Together, our results demonstrate that automated home-cage monitoring could be a feasible alternative to conventional methods, such as the open-field test and combining several behavioral assessments may provide a better understanding of sickness behavior and pain-like behaviors in LPS-treated mice."

We established a moderated mediation model to examine the relationship of the four restorative components of soundscape: being away, compatibility, extent and fascination. The data were collected in Xixi Wetland National Park, China, before the outbreak of COVID-19 (n = 562) in October 2019 and post COVID-19 in October 2020 (n = 341). The results revealed that natural soundscapes have great restorative benefits for visitors. The inter relationships of the restorative components are moderated by the perceived stress level which show significant different before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The post-COVID-19 visitors reported a higher level of stress while natural soundscapes had greater effects on their mental restoration. The direct effects of extent and fascination as well as the mediating effects of fascination were stronger among the post-COVID-19 group. However, the path coefficient from being away to compatibility were higher in the pre-COVID-19 group.

https://openalex.org/W3196874575,"Abundance and distribution of earthworms in agricultural fields is frequently proposed as a measure of soil quality assuming that observed patterns of abundance are in response to improved or degraded environmental conditions. However, it is not clear that earthworm abundances can be directly related to their edaphic environment, as noted in Darwin’s final publication, perhaps limiting or restricting their value as indicators of ecological quality in any given field. We present results from a spatially explicit intensive survey of pastures within United Kingdom farms, looking for the main drivers of earthworm density at a range of scales. When describing spatial variability of both total and ecotype-specific earthworm abundance within any given field, the best predictor was earthworm abundance itself within 20–30 m of the sampling point; there were no consistent environmental correlates with earthworm numbers, suggesting that biological factors (e.g. colonisation rate, competition, predation, parasitism) drive or at least significantly modify earthworm distributions at this spatial level. However, at the national scale, earthworm abundance is well predicted by soil nitrate levels, density, temperature and moisture content, albeit not in a simple linear fashion. This suggests that although land can be managed at the farm scale to promote earthworm abundance and the resulting soil processes that deliver ecosystem services, within a field, earthworm distributions will remain patchy. The use of earthworms as soil quality indicators must therefore be carried out with care, ensuring that sufficient samples are taken within field to take account of variability in earthworm populations that is unrelated to soil chemical and physical properties."
https://openalex.org/W3196053738,"Repeated implantation failure (RIF) is a major problem that limits the pregnancy rate associated with assisted reproductive technology. However, the pathogenesis of RIF is still unknown. Recently, the expression levels of circular RNAs (circRNAs) were profiled in the endometrial tissues of patients with RIF. However, the exact role of circRNAs in RIF remains unclear. In our study, we found that circFAM120A levels were significantly down-regulated in the endometrium at the window of implantation in RIF patients compared with non-RIF controls. The suppression of circFAM120A expression inhibited decidualization in human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs). Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis after circFAM120A knockdown revealed ABHD5 as a potential downstream target gene of circFAM120A. As expected, down-regulating ABHD5 in hESCs also inhibited decidualization. Using the starBase and TargetScan databases, we predicted that miR-29 may interact with ABHD5, based on nucleotide sequence matching. Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-29 bound to the 3′ UTR of ABHD5 at the predicted complementary sites. Moreover, miR-29 mimics efficiently reduced ABHD5 expression levels and suppressed the decidualization process, whereas a miR-29 inhibitor partly rescued ABHD5 mRNA expression level and decidualization reduced by the knockdown of circFAM120A. Therefore, circFAM120A modulated decidualization in RIF through the miR-29/ABHD5 axis."
https://openalex.org/W3196806329,"The COVID-19 pandemic might affect many aspects of the community and a range of psychiatric risk factors due to life changes, including people’s behaviors and perceptions. In this study, we aim to identify specific life changes that correlate with psychological distress within the social context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. In July 2020, workers (company employees and civil servants) in Japan were recruited from local institutions that had not had any confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as neighborhoods that had only a few cases. Participants completed a COVID-19 mental health survey ( N = 609; 66.9% male). Psychological distress was identified based on Kessler-6 scores (≥13). Life changes were assessed by an open-ended question about life changes in participants and their family, workplace, and community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A convergent mixed-method approach was used to compare the context of perceived life changes in participants with psychological distress and those without. As a result, 8.9% of participants had psychological distress, and sex and age categories were different between those with psychological distress and those without. Among the participants who responded to the open-ended question, the biggest life change was “staying at home,” and the next biggest life changes were “event cancellations” and “increased workload” in participants with psychological distress, and “no changes” and “mask-wearing” in those without psychological distress, respectively. Regarding emotional/perceptual changes, “stress,” “fear,” and “anger” were more frequently reported by participants with psychological distress than those without ( P &lt;0.001). By integrating these findings, we identified themes focusing on vulnerable characteristics related to psychological distress. This study may provide a source in society for mediating psychological distress during a pandemic."

Best management practices include conducting research to better understand factors that lead to optimal welfare and then turning findings into practice. The current study is part of the larger Cetacean Welfare Study or more formally, “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums.” Facilities participating in the study were accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Animal management factors and habitat characteristics were examined in relation to two potential indicators of welfare for common ( Tursiops truncatus ) and Indo-Pacific ( Tursiops aduncus ) bottlenose dolphins. Specifically, we examined environmental enrichment, animal training, and habitat characteristics that were significantly related to behavioral diversity and route tracing, a form of stereotypic behavior. Behavior was recorded from 47 animals at 25 facilities around the world. Overall, the rate of route tracing behavior observed during the study was very low and few animal management factors or habitat characteristics were found to be related to this behavior. One factor, enrichment diversity, had a significant positive relationship with route tracing and an inverse relationship with behavioral diversity. This finding may be a product of a response mounted by animal care specialists to the behavior as opposed to a cause. Animals that engaged in this behavior were likely provided more diverse enrichment in attempts to ameliorate the stereotypic behavior. However, multiple factors were found to significantly relate to behavioral diversity, a potential positive indicator of welfare for bottlenose dolphins. Dolphins that were trained on a predictable schedule had higher behavioral diversity than those on a semi-predictable schedule. There was a positive significant relationship between behavioral diversity and the number of habitats to which an animal had access, and a significant inverse relationship with the maximum depth of the habitat. Finally, animals that were split into groups and reunited or rotated between subgroups had higher behavioral diversity than animals managed in the same group. Information gained from the current study suggested that animal management techniques may be more important in ensuring good welfare for bottlenose dolphins than focusing on habitat size."
https://openalex.org/W3195006614,"BRAF-driven colorectal cancer is among the poorest prognosis subtypes of colon cancer. Previous studies suggest that BRAF-mutant serrated cancers frequently exhibit Microsatellite Instability (MSI) and elevated levels of WNT signaling. The loss of tumor-suppressor Smad4 in oncogenic BRAF-V600E mouse models promotes rapid serrated tumor development and progression, and SMAD4 mutations co-occur in human patient tumors with BRAF-V600E mutations. This study assesses the role of SMAD4 in early-stage serrated tumorigenesis. SMAD4 loss promotes microsatellite stable (MSS) serrated tumors in an oncogenic BRAF-V600E context, providing a model for MSS serrated cancers. Inactivation of Msh2 in these mice accelerated tumor formation, and whole-exome sequencing of both MSS and MSI serrated tumors derived from these mouse models revealed that all serrated tumors developed oncogenic WNT mutations, predominantly in the WNT-effector gene Ctnnb1 (β-catenin). Mouse models mimicking the oncogenic β-catenin mutation show that the combination of three oncogenic mutations (Ctnnb1, Braf, and Smad4) are critical to drive rapid serrated dysplasia formation. Re-analysis of human tumor data reveals BRAF-V600E mutations co-occur with oncogenic mutations in both WNT and SMAD4/TGFβ pathways. These findings identify SMAD4 as a critical factor in early-stage serrated cancers and helps broaden the knowledge of this rare but aggressive subset of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3198058114,"Objective To contribute to the validation of AudBility, an online central auditory processing screening program, considering the tasks for age between 6 and 8 years-old, from the investigation of sensitivity and specificity, as well as to suggest a minimum central auditory processing (CAP) screening protocol in this age group. Method In the first stage of the study, 154 schoolchildren were screened. Children were aged between 6 and 8 years old, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese. The auditory tasks of AudBility analyzed in this study were: sound localization (SL), auditory closure (AC), figure-ground (FG), dichotic digits—binaural integration (DD), temporal resolution (TR) and temporal frequency ordering (TO-F). In the second stage, 112 children attended to CAP assessment in the institution’s laboratory. The calculation of efficacy (sensitivity/specificity) was obtained through the construction of the ROC curve for the tests with more than five children altered in the diagnosis. Results For the 6–7-year-old age group the accuracy values were: AC (76.9%); FG (61.6%); DD 78.8% for the right ear and 84.4% for the left ear in females and 63.2% for the left ear in males; TR (77.1%) and TO-F (74.4% for the right ear and 82.4% for the left ear). For the 8-year-old age group the values were: FF (76.5%); DD (71.7% for the left ear for females and 77% for the right ear for males); TR (56.5%) and TO-F (54.1% for the right ear and 70% for the left ear). Conclusions AudBility showed variations in sensitivity and specificity values between the auditory tasks and age groups, with better effectiveness in schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 7 than eight-year-olds, except for the FG task. For screening purposes, the application of the protocol involving five tasks for the 6 to 7-year-olds group and with four tasks for the 8-year-olds group is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3194650151,"The Split-Cre system is a powerful tool for genetic manipulation and can be used to spatiotemporally control gene expression in vivo. However, the low activity of the reconstituted NCre/CCre recombinase in the Split-Cre system limits its application as an indicator of the simultaneous expression of a pair of genes of interest. Here, we describe two approaches for improving the activity of the Split-Cre system after Cre reconstitution based on self-associating split GFP (Split-GFP) and SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation. First, we created the Split-GFP-Cre system by constructing fusion proteins of NCre and CCre with the N-terminal and C-terminal subunits of GFP, respectively. Reconstitution of Cre by GFP-mediated dimerization of the two fusion proteins resulted in recombinase activity approaching that of full-length Cre in living cells. Second, to further increase recombinase activity at low levels of Split-Cre expression, the Split-Spy-GCre system was established by incorporating the sequences for SpyTag and SpyCatcher into the components of the Split-GFP-Cre system. As anticipated, covalent conjugation of the SpyTag and SpyCatcher segments improved Split-GFP dimerization to further increase Cre recombinase activity in living cells. The increased efficiency and robustness of this dual-split system (Split-Cre and Split-GFP) minimize the problems of incomplete double gene-specific KO or low labeling efficiency due to poor NCre/CCre recombinase activity. Thus, this Split-Spy-GCre system allows more precise gene manipulation of cell subpopulations, which will provide advanced analysis of genes and cell functions in complex tissue such as the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W3194725997,"Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) responds well with the targeted therapy drugs, Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI), that give potentially long-term disease control for the patients. The objective of this study was to determine the disease burden and factors influencing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health status of CML patients in Klang Valley, Malaysia. CML patients were recruited from haematological outpatient clinics in health centres in Klang Valley, Malaysia. A semi-guided self-administered questionnaire was used. HRQoL was measured by EQ-5D utility value and health status was by visual analogue score (VAS). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors influencing HRQoL and health status. A total of 221 respondents participated, where more than half were Malay (56.6%), male (53.4%), and an Imatinib user (68.8%). Majority were diagnosed at the chronic phase (89.5%). The mean age of diagnosis was 41 years old. Significant determinant associated with HRQoL was age of diagnosis. These factors had no significant effect on the HRQoL of these patients regardless of types of TKI used and initial phase of CML. The overall HRQoL of CML patients were comparable to, if not higher, than the general population. Any TKI that was good enough to eliminate disease symptoms and erase patient's worries, can possibly make CML patients have a better quality of life than typical cancer patients and even the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3196564882,"The way an animal uses its habitat can serve as an indicator of habitat appropriateness for the species and individuals. Bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus and Tursiops aduncus ) in accredited zoos and aquariums experience a range of habitat types and management programs that provide opportunities for dolphins to engage in species-appropriate behaviors and potentially influence their individual and group welfare. Data in the present study were collected as part of a larger study titled “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums” (colloquially called the Cetacean Welfare Study). Non-invasive bio-logging devices (Movement Tags) recorded the diving behavior and vertical habitat movements of 60 bottlenose dolphins at 31 zoos and aquariums that were accredited by the Alliance for Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums. Bottlenose dolphins wore a Movement Tag one day per week for two five-week data collection periods. Demographic variables, environmental enrichment programs, training programs, and habitat characteristics were associated with habitat usage. Longer dive durations and use of the bottom third of the habitat were associated with higher enrichment program index values. Dolphins receiving new enrichment on a monthly/weekly schedule also used the bottom third of the habitat more often than those receiving new enrichment on a yearly/year+ schedule. Dolphins that were managed in a group that was split into smaller subgroups during the day and were reunited into one group at night spent less time in the top third of the habitat than those who remained in a single group with consistent members at all times. Dolphins that were managed as subgroups with rotating members but were never united as one group spent less time in the bottom third of the habitat than those who remained in a single group with consistent members at all times. Taken together, the results suggested that management practices, such as enrichment and training programs, played a greater role in how dolphins interacted with their environment relative to the physical characteristics of the habitat."
https://openalex.org/W3197308986,"Bottlenose dolphins are a behaviorally complex, social species that display a variety of social behaviors. Because of this, it is important for zoological facilities to strive to ensure animals display species-appropriate levels of social behavior. The current study is part of the multi-institutional study entitled “Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums” commonly referred to as the Cetacean Welfare Study. All participating facilities were accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Behavioral data were collected on 47 bottlenose dolphins representing two subspecies, Tursiops truncatus and Tursiops aduncus , at 25 facilities. The social behaviors of group related activity ( group active ) as well as interacting with conspecifics ( interact with conspecific ) were examined for their relationships to both animal management factors and habitat characteristics. The behavioral state of group active and the rate of interact with conspecific were both positively related to the frequency of receiving new forms of environmental enrichment. Both were inversely related to the random scheduling of environmental enrichment. Additional results suggested interact with conspecific was inversely related with daytime spatial experience and that males displayed group active more than females. Overall, the results suggested that animal management techniques such as the type and timing of enrichment may be more important to enhance social behavior than habitat characteristics or the size of the habitat. Information gained from this study can help facilities with bottlenose dolphins manage their enrichment programs in relation to social behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3197983950,"Cervical microbiota (CM) are considered an important factor affecting the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and are implicated in the persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV). Collection of liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples is routine for cervical cancer screening and HPV genotyping and can be used for long-term cytological biobanking. We sought to determine whether it is possible to access microbial DNA from LBC specimens, and compared the performance of four different extraction protocols: (ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit; QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA Kit; QIAamp DNA Mini Kit; and IndiSpin Pathogen Kit) and their ability to capture the diversity of CM from LBC specimens. LBC specimens from 20 patients (stored for 716 ± 105 days) with CIN values of 2 or 3 were each aliquoted for each of the four kits. Loss of microbial diversity due to long-term LBC storage could not be assessed due to lack of fresh LBC samples. Comparisons with other types of cervical sampling were not performed. We observed that all DNA extraction kits provided equivalent accessibility to the cervical microbial DNA within stored LBC samples. Approximately 80% microbial genera were shared among all DNA extraction protocols. Potential kit contaminants were observed as well. Variation between individuals was a significantly greater influence on the observed microbial composition than was the method of DNA extraction. We also observed that HPV16 was significantly associated with community types that were not dominated by Lactobacillus iners."

Twelve, pregnant ewes between 72-92 days of gestation were challenged IV with C. jejuni IA3902 and then treated with 1.1 ml/45.36 kg of tulathromycin subcutaneously 18 hours post-challenge. Ewes were bled at predetermined time points and euthanized either at a predetermined time point or following the observation of vaginal bleeding or abortion. Following euthanasia, tissues were collected for bacterial culture, pharmacokinetics and histologic examination. The maximum (geometric) mean tulathromycin plasma concentration was estimated at 0.302 μg/mL, with a peak level observed at around 1.2 hours. The apparent systemic clearance of tulathromycin was estimated at 16.6 L/h (or 0.28 L/kg/h) with an elimination half-life estimated at approximately 22 hours. The mean tissue concentrations were highest in the uterus (2.464 μg/g) and placentome (0.484 μg/g), and were lowest in fetal liver (0.11 μg/g) and fetal lung (0.03 μg/g). Compared to previous reports, results of this study demonstrate that prior IV administration of C. jejuni appeared to substantially alter the pharmacokinetics of tulathromycin, reducing both the peak plasma concentrations and elimination half-life. However, additional controlled trials are required to confirm those observations."
https://openalex.org/W3194228303,"A test-negative case-control study was conducted to assess inactivated influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in children aged 6 months-17 years. The database was developed from the US Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program over four consecutive influenza seasons from 2016 to 2020. A total of 9,385 children including 4,063 medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza-positive cases were identified for VE analysis. A generalized linear mixed model with logit link and binomial distribution was used to estimate the VE. The adjusted VE for children was 42% [95% confidence interval (CI): 37-47%] overall, including 55% (95% CI: 47-61%) for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 37% (95% CI: 28-45%) for influenza A(H3N2), and 49% (95% CI: 41-55%) for influenza B. The analysis by age groups indicated that the adjusted VE in children aged 6 months-4 years was higher against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B, and comparable against influenza A(H3N2), compared to those in children aged 5-17 years. Further age-stratified analysis showed that the VE against any types of influenza was low and non-significant for children aged 6-11 months (33%; 95% CI:-2-56%), but it was high (54%; 95% CI: 34-67%) in children aged 12-23 months, and then declined linearly with increasing age. In conclusion, the inactivated influenza vaccination was moderately effective against influenza infection, based on the analysis from a large number of children aged 6 months-17 years over multiple influenza seasons."
https://openalex.org/W3195967678,"Background Degenerative compressive myelopathy (DCM) is caused by cervical cord compression. The relationship between the magnitude and clinical findings of cervical cord compression has been described in the literature, but the details remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between the magnitude and clinical symptoms of cervical cord compression in community-dwelling residents. Methods The present study included 532 subjects. The subjective symptoms and the objective findings of one board-certified spine surgeon were assessed. The subjective symptoms were upper extremity pain and numbness, clumsy hand, fall in the past 1 year, and subjective gait disturbance. The objective findings were: Hoffmann, Trömner, and Wartenberg signs; Babinski’s and Chaddock’s signs; hyperreflexia of the patellar tendon and Achilles tendon reflexes; ankle clonus; Romberg and modified Romberg tests; grip and release test; finger escape sign; and grip strength. Using midsagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, the anterior–posterior (AP) diameters (mm) of the spinal cord at the C2 midvertebral body level (D C2 ) and at each intervertebral disc level from C2/3 to C7/T1 (D C2/3-C7/T1 ) were measured. The spinal cord compression ratio (R) for each intervertebral disc level was defined and calculated as D C2/3-C7/T1 divided by D C2 . The lowest R (LR) along C2/3 to C7/T1 of each individual was divided into 3 grades by the tertile method. The relationship between LR and clinical symptoms was investigated by trend analysis. Results The prevalence of subjective gait disturbance increased significantly with the severity of spinal cord compression (p = 0.002812), whereas the other clinical symptoms were not significantly related with the severity of spinal cord compression. Conclusions The magnitude of cervical cord compression had no relationship with any of the neurologic findings. However, subjective gait disturbance might be a better indicator of the possibility of early stage cervical cord compression."
https://openalex.org/W3196794157,"Background Tobacco policies, including clean indoor air laws and cigarette taxes, increase smoking cessation in part by stimulating the use of cessation treatments. We explored whether the associations between tobacco policies and treatment use varies across sociodemographic groups. Methods We used data from 62,165 U.S. adult participants in the 2003 and 2010/11 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) who reported smoking cigarettes during the past-year. We built on prior structural equation models used to quantify the degree to which smoking cessation treatment use (prescription medications, nicotine replacement therapy, counseling/support groups, quitlines, and internet resources) mediated the association between clean indoor air laws, cigarette excise taxes, and recent smoking cessation. In the current study, we added selected moderators to each model to investigate whether associations between tobacco polices and smoking cessation treatment use varied by sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, and health insurance status. Results Associations between clean indoor air laws and the use of prescription medication and nicotine replacement therapies varied significantly between racial/ethnic, age, and education groups in 2003. However, none of these moderation effects remained significant in 2010/11. Higher cigarette excise taxes in 2010/2011 were associated with higher odds of using counseling among older adults and higher odds of using prescription medications among younger adults. No other moderator reached statistical significance. Smoking cessation treatments did not mediate the effect of taxes on smoking cessation in 2003 and were not included in these analyses. Conclusions Sociodemographic differences in associations between clean indoor air laws and smoking cessation treatment use have decreased from 2003 to 2010/11. In most cases, policies appear to stimulate smoking cessation treatment use similarly across varied sociodemographic groups."
https://openalex.org/W3197111431,"The genotype main effects plus the genotype × environment interaction effects model has been widely used to analyze multi-environmental trials data, especially using a graphical biplot considering the first two principal components of the singular value decomposition of the interaction matrix. Many authors have noted the advantages of applying Bayesian inference in these classes of models to replace the frequentist approach. This results in parsimonious models, and eliminates parameters that would be present in a traditional analysis of bilinear components (frequentist form). This work aims to extend shrinkage methods to estimators of those parameters that composes the multiplicative part of the model, using the maximum entropy principle for prior justification. A Bayesian version (non-shrinkage prior, using conjugacy and large variance) was also used for comparison. The simulated data set had 20 genotypes evaluated across seven environments, in a complete randomized block design with three replications. Cross-validation procedures were conducted to assess the predictive ability of the model and information criteria were used for model selection. A better predictive capacity was found for the model with a shrinkage effect, especially for unorthogonal scenarios in which more genotypes were removed at random. In these cases, however, the best fitted models, as measured by information criteria, were the conjugate flat prior. In addition, the flexibility of the Bayesian method was found, in general, to attribute inference to the parameters of the models which related to the biplot representation. Maximum entropy prior was the more parsimonious, and estimates singular values with a greater contribution to the sum of squares of the genotype + genotype × environmental interaction. Hence, this method enabled the best discrimination of parameters responsible for the existing patterns and the best discarding of the noise than the model assuming non-informative priors for multiplicative parameters."

Creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CKMB) and cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) were analyzed as markers of myocardial injury. For histological analysis, hematoxylin-eosin (HE), elastic Van Gieson (EVG), CD41 and myeloperoxidase were used to stain rat hearts. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were a critical factor for mortality (p = 0.037) in human ALF. Deceased patients exhibited higher levels of CKMB than survivors (p = 0.023). CKMB was a predictor of mortality in ALF (p = 0.013). Animals that died early after BDL exhibited increased cTnI, CKMB, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels compared to controls (cTnI: p = 0.011, CKMB: p = 0.008, TNFα: p = 0.003, IL-6: p = 0.006). These animals showed perivascular lesions and wavy fibers, microthrombi and neutrophilic infiltration in the heart. MACEs are decisive for mortality in human ALF, and elevated CKMB values indicate that this might be due to structural myocardial damage. Accordingly, CKMB was found to have predictive value for mortality in ALF. The results are substantiated by data from a rat BDL model demonstrating diffuse myocardial injury."

Herein, we show that polyethylene glycol coated (PEG) gold nanorods (AuNRs) and PEG AuNRs covered with a thin layer of silver (AuNR/Ag) may enhance the immune response towards immune suppression or activation. We also studied the ability to enhance CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs in vitro using AuNRs functionalized with interleukin 2 (IL2), a cytokine that is important in Treg development and homeostasis. Our results indicate that AuNRs enhance different immune cells and that NP composition matters in immune targeting. This knowledge will help us understand how to better design AuNRs to target and enhance the immune system."

The years of life lost due to premature death (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated according to the new methodology designed for that purpose.The loss of years of healthy life due to road incidents of motorcyclists in the four-year period was 80,046 DALYs (823.8 per 100,000 inhabitants), with a higher proportion in men (81.3% and a ratio of 5 to 1 compared to women); the YLDs was 66.6% with marked differences in favor of men. There was nearly a 38% difference in the ages of 15 to 19 as well as a 19% difference from 30 to 49, compared to women. Premature death (YLLs) contributed to 33.4% of DALYs, with significant presentation in the above-mentioned age groups.The greatest loss of years of healthy life due to road incidents of motorcyclists in Medellin was due to non-fatal injuries and was concentrated in young men.

The transition from the donor has not been yet fully understood, and no study quantifies if and how the liver function changes through its transfer to the recipient. The indocyanine green dye plasma disappearance rate (ICG-PDR) is a simple validated tool of liver function assessment. The variation rate between the donor and recipient ICG-PDR still needs to be investigated.Single-center retrospective study. ICG-PDR determinations were performed before graft retrieval (T1) and 24 hours after transplant (T2). The ICG-PDR relative variation rate between T1 and T2 was calculated to assess the graft function and suffering/recovering. Matched data were compared with the MEAF model of graft dysfunction.To investigate whether the variation rate between the donor ICG-PDR value and the recipient ICG-PDR measurement on first postoperative day (POD1) can be associated with the MEAF score.36 ICG-PDR measurements between 18 donors and 18 graft recipients were performed. The mean donor ICG-PDR was 22.64 (SD 6.35), and the mean receiver's ICG-PDR on 1st POD was 17.68 (SD 6.60), with a mean MEAF value of 4.51 (SD 1.23). Pearson's test stressed a good, linear inverse correlation between the ICG-PDR relative variation and the MEAF values, correlation coefficient -0.580 (p = 0.012).The direct correlation between the donor to recipient ICG-PDR variation rate and MEAF was found. Measurements at T1 and T2 showed an up- or downtrend of the graft performance that reflect the MEAF values."
https://openalex.org/W3196179805,"The international tax treaty system is a highly integrated and complex network. In this system, many multinational enterprises (MNEs) explore ways of reducing taxes by choosing optimal detour routes. Treaty abuse by these MNEs causes significant loss of tax revenues for many countries, but there is no systematic way of regulating their actions. However, it may be helpful to find a way of detecting the optimal routes by which MNEs avoid taxes and observe the effects of this behavior. In this paper, we investigate the international tax treaty network system of foreign investment channels based on real data and introduce a novel measure of tax-routing centrality and other centralities via network analysis. Our analysis of tax routing in a multiplex network reveals not only various tax-minimizing routes and their rates, but also new paths which cannot be found by navigating a single network layer. In addition, we identify strongly connected components of the multiplex tax treaty system with minimal tax shopping routes; more than 80 countries are included in this system. This means that there are far more pathways to be observed than can be detected on any given individual single layer. We provide a unified framework for analyzing the international tax treaty system and observing the effects of tax avoidance by MNEs."
https://openalex.org/W3196288397,"Background Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is a common undesirable event associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several clinical prediction tools for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with AECOPD have been developed in the past decades. However, some issues concerning the validity and availability of some predictors in the existing models may undermine their clinical applicability in resource-limited clinical settings. Methods We developed a multivariable model for predicting in-hospitality from a retrospective cohort of patients admitted with AECOPD to one tertiary care center in Thailand from October 2015 to September 2017. Multivariable logistic regression with fractional polynomial algorithms and cluster variance correction was used for model derivation. Results During the study period, 923 admissions from 600 patients with AECOPD were included. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.68 per 100 admission-day. Eleven potential predictors from the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable logistic regression. The reduced model, named MAGENTA, incorporated seven final predictors: age, body temperature, mean arterial pressure, the requirement of endotracheal intubation, serum sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and serum albumin. The model discriminative ability based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AuROC) was excellent at 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.77, 0.86), and the calibration was good. Conclusion The MAGENTA model consists of seven routinely available clinical predictors upon patient admissions. The model can be used as an assisting tool to aid clinicians in accurate risk stratification and making appropriate decisions to admit patients for intensive care."
https://openalex.org/W3196842279,"Introduction Cesarean section (CS) rates are increasing worldwide. One constant indication is the breech presentation at term. By offering external cephalic version (ECV) and vaginal breech delivery CS rates can be further reduced. Objective This study aimed to analyze the ECV at 38 weeks of gestation with the associate uptake rate, predicting factors, success rate, and complications at a tertiary healthcare provider in Germany specializing in vaginal breech delivery. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study with retrospective data acquisition. All women with a singleton fetus in breech presentation presenting after 34 weeks of gestation for counseling between 2013 and 2017 were included. ECV impact factors were analyzed using logistic regression. Results A total of 1,598 women presented for breech birth planning. ECV was performed on 353 patients. The overall success rate was 22.4%. A later week of gestation (odds ratio [OR] 1.69), an abundant amniotic fluid index (AFI score) (OR 5.74), fundal (OR 3.78) and anterior (OR 0.39) placental location, and an oblique lie (OR 9.08) were significantly associated with successful ECV in our population. No major complications were observed. The overall vaginal delivery rates could be increased to approximately 14% with ECV. Conclusion The demand for alternative birth modes other than CS for breech birth is high in the area of Frankfurt, Germany. Our study offers evidence of the safety of ECV at 38 weeks. Centers with expertise in vaginal breech delivery and ECV can reduce CS-rates. To further establish vaginal breech delivery and ECV as alternate options, the required knowledge and skill should be implemented in the revised curricula."
https://openalex.org/W3193651413,"Baryancistrus xanthellus (Loricariidae) is an endemic fish species from the Xingu River basin with its life history in the shallow rapid waters flowing over bedrock substrates. In order to investigate the genetic diversity and demographic history of B. xanthellus we analyzed sequence data for one mitochondrial gene (Cyt b) and introns 1 and 5 of nuclear genes Prolactin (Prl) and Ribosomal Protein L3 (RPL3). The analyses contain 358 specimens of B. xanthellus from 39 localities distributed throughout its range. The number of genetically diverged groups was estimated using Bayesian inference on Cyt b haplotypes. Haplotype networks, AMOVA and pairwise fixation index was used to evaluate population structure and gene flow. Historical demography was inferred through neutrality tests and the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot (EBSP) method. Five longitudinally distributed Cyt b haplogroups for B. xanthellus were identified in the Xingu River and its major tributaries, the Bacajá and Iriri. The demographic analysis suggests that rapids habitats have expanded in the Iriri and Lower Xingu rivers since 200 ka (thousand years) ago. This expansion is possibly related to an increase in water discharge as a consequence of higher rainfall across eastern Amazonia. Conversely, this climate shift also would have promoted zones of sediment trapping and reduction of rocky habitats in the Xingu River channel upstream of the Iriri River mouth. Populations of B. xanthellus showed strong genetic structure along the free-flowing river channels of the Xingu and its major tributaries, the Bacajá and Iriri. The recent impoundment of the Middle Xingu channel for the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam may isolate populations at the downstream limit of the species distribution. Therefore, future conservation plans must consider the genetic diversity of B. xanthellus throughout its range."
https://openalex.org/W3194177139,"Around 30% of the HCV infected patients can spontaneously clear the virus. Cumulative evidence suggests the role of neutralizing antibodies in such spontaneous resolution. Understanding the epitope specificity of such antibodies will inform the rational vaccine design as such information is limited to date. In addition to conformational epitope targeted antibodies, linear epitope specific antibodies have been identified that are broadly cross reactive against diverse HCV strains. In this study, we have characterized the potential role of three conserved linear epitopes in the spontaneous clearance of HCV.We tested the reactivity of sera from chronic patients (CP) and spontaneous resolvers (SR) with linear peptides corresponding to three conserved regions of HCV envelope protein E2 spanning amino acids 412-423, 523-532 and 432-443 using ELISA. Subsequently, we characterized the dependency of HCV neutralization by the reactive serum samples on the antibodies specific for these epitopes using pseudoparticle-based neutralization assay. In ELISA most of the CP sera showed reactivity to multiple peptides while most of the SR samples were reactive to a single peptide suggesting presence of more specific antibodies in the SR sera. In most of the HCVpp neutralizing sera of particular peptide reactivity the neutralization was significantly affected by the presence of respective peptide. HCV neutralization by CP sera was affected by multiple peptides while 75% of the HCVpp neutralizing SR sera were competed by the 432 epitope.These findings suggest that individuals who spontaneously resolve HCV infection at the acute phase, can produce antibodies specific for conserved linear epitopes, and those antibodies can potentially play a role in the spontaneous viral clearance. The epitope present in the 432-443 region of E2 was identified as the primary neutralizing epitope with potential role in spontaneous viral clearance and this epitope potentiates for the design of immunogen for prophylactic vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W3194197920,"The study examined whether psychiatric/psychosomatic rehabilitation continues to have a better course of treatment for women than men.We compared the course of global symptom severity, health-related quality of life and functioning between admission and discharge in patients (848 men, 1412 women) at an Austrian psychiatric/psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic.Gender-specific differences in the course of treatment were all too small to be clinically relevant. The differences were smallest in the middle-aged cohort. However, at the time of admission, women reported a slightly higher symptom burden.Overall, the results show a gender-fair effectiveness of the rehabilitation. The new findings could be explained by changes in living conditions, gender roles, or better treatment methods."
https://openalex.org/W3195871366,"In clinical settings, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with comorbid depression is often difficult to diagnose, and should be considered in treatment. However, to our knowledge, no functional imaging study has examined the difference between ASD adolescents with and without comorbid depression. We aimed to compare the characteristics and prefrontal brain function of ASD with and without depression in order to identify a biological marker that can be used to detect the difference. Twenty-eight drug-naïve adolescents with ASD (14 ASD with and 14 ASD without depression) and 14 age- and gender-matched adolescents with typical development were evaluated using several variables. These included intelligence quotient, autism quotient, depression severity using the Beck Depression Inventory 2nd edition (BDI-II), and level of social functioning using the Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS). In addition, frontotemporal hemodynamic responses during a verbal fluency task (VFT) were measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The ASD group, including both of the ASD with and ASD without depression groups, showed smaller hemodynamic responses than the typical development group in portions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and anterior part of the temporal cortex (aTC) during the VFT. Moreover, the smaller hemodynamic responses in the right VLPFC during the VFT in the ASD group were associated with the worse BDI-II and SASS scores. Furthermore, the ASD with depression group showed smaller hemodynamic responses in the right VLPFC during the VFT than the ASD without depression group in a direct comparison. Adolescents with ASD showed reduced activation in broad frontotemporal regions during a cognitive task compared with those with typical development. More specifically, the right VLPFC activation reflected the level of self-estimated depression and social functioning in the ASD subjects, and could be used to discriminate between ASD adolescents with and without depression."
https://openalex.org/W3196739083,"Background Countries across the globe have mobilized their armed forces in response to COVID-19, placing them at increased risk for viral exposure. Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 among military personnel serve as biomarkers of infection and provide a basis for disease surveillance and recognition of work-related risk factors. Methods Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen-specific IgG in serum obtained from N = 988 US National Guard soldiers between April-June 2020. Occupational information, e.g. military operating specialty (MOS) codes, and demographic data were obtained via questionnaire. Plaque assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were used to assess serum neutralizing capacity for limited subjects (N = 12). Results The SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate among the study population was 10.3% and significantly associated with occupation and demographics. Odds ratios were highest for those working in MOS 2T-Transportation (3.6; 95% CI 0.7–18) and 92F-Fuel specialist/ground and aircraft (6.8; 95% CI 1.5–30), as well as black race (2.2; 95% CI 1.2–4.1), household size ≥6 (2.5; 95% CI 1.3–4.6) and known COVID-19 exposure (2.0; 95% CI 1.2–3.3). Seropositivity tracked along major interstate highways and clustered near the international airport and the New York City border. SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG + serum exhibited low to moderate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity with IC 50s ranging from 1:15 to 1:280. In limited follow-up testing SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG levels remained elevated up to 7 months. Conclusions The data highlight increased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among National Guard vs. the local civilian population in association with transportation-related occupations and specific demographics."
https://openalex.org/W3195956853,"The rare incidence of submucosal invasive non-ampullary duodenal carcinoma has led to scant information in literature; therefore, we compared the clinicopathological features between submucosal invasive carcinoma (SM-Ca), mucosal carcinoma (M-Ca), and advanced carcinoma (Ad-Ca).We retrospectively analyzed 165 patients with sporadic non-ampullary duodenal carcinomas (SNADCs) from four institutions between January 2003 and December 2018. The SNADCs were divided to three groups according to histological diagnosis: SM-Ca, M-Ca, and Ad-Ca. The clinicopathological characteristics and mucin phenotypes were compared between groups.Among the 165 SNADCs, 11 (7%) were classified as SM-Ca, 70 (42%) as M-Ca, and 84 (51%) as Ad-Ca. We found that all SM-Ca (P = 0.013) and most Ad-Ca (P = 0.020) lesions were located on the oral-Vater; however, an almost equal distribution of M-Ca lesions was found between the oral- and anal-Vater. No significant difference was observed between the tumor diameter of M-Ca and SM-Ca; however, 45% (5/11) of SM-Ca were ≤10 mm. A total of 73% (8/11) of SM-Ca were classified as gastric phenotype and no lesions were classified as intestinal phenotype; whereas most M-Ca were classified as intestinal phenotype (67%, 8/12).SM-Ca lesions were all located on the oral-Vater and were highly associated with the gastric mucin phenotype, which were different from the features of most M-Ca."
https://openalex.org/W3196019403,"The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with tachyarrhythmia can be negatively influenced by the clinical manifestations. The evaluation of HRQOL with validated instruments can provide valuable information that will contribute to clinical decision-making and treatment. In Brazil, however, there is no available scale that evaluates HRQOL in different types of arrhythmia. The purpose of this study was to adapt the Arrhythmia-Specific Questionnaire in Tachycardia and Arrhythmia-HRQOL scale (ASTA-HRQOL scale) to the Brazilian culture, and to assess the psychometric properties of the adapted questionnaire.The study used a methodological process of cultural adaptation based on international literature guidelines. The analyses were performed with 172 participants, 32 for cultural adaptation and 140 for psychometric validation. Calculation included analysis of reliability by Cronbach's α coefficient, construct validity with convergent validity using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire and by the Spearman correlation coefficient, Average Variance Extracted, and assessment of confirmatory factor analysis.The translation and adaptation processes showed a satisfactory degree of comprehension and applicability (93% reported them to be easy to understand). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated exclusion of one item from the mental scale, but after qualitative analysis the item was retained. The items presented adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.88), and an inverse correlation of moderate magnitude with the physical domain (rho = -0.63) and with the mental domain (rho = -0.58) of the WHOQOL-BREF.The Brazilian Portuguese version of the ASTA-HRQOL scale, the ASTA-Br-HRQOL scale, can be a valuable tool for use in clinical practice and research."
