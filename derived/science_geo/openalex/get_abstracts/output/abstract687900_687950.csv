https://openalex.org/W4210702596,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation has recently been found involving in regulatory mechanism of the tumor progression. Our aim was to explore the biological function and clinical significance of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). In this study, we revealed that METTL3 was upregulated and predicted poor prognosis of patients with ICC. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that METTL3 expression was an independent predictor for overall survival in patients with ICC. Moreover, METTL3 knockdown inhibited ICC progression, while METTL3 overexpression showed the opposite effect. METTL3 inhibitor STM2457 also showed anti-tumor effect in ICC. Mechanistically, METTL3 transcription was driven by H3K4me3 activation. Upregulation of METTL3 mediated m6A modification of IFIT2 mRNA and accelerated IFIT2 mRNA decay in a YTHDF2-dependent manner, which promoted the development of ICC and lead to poorer prognosis. In summary, our findings revealed that H3K4me3 activation-driven METTL3 transcription promotes ICC progression by YTHDF2-mediated IFIT2 mRNA degradation, suggesting that METTL3 may serve as a potential target for human ICC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4210704366,"In many countries of the world, COVID–19 pandemic has led to exceptional changes in mortality trends. Some studies have tried to quantify the effects of Covid-19 in terms of a reduction in life expectancy at birth in 2020. However, these estimates might need to be updated now that, in most countries, the mortality data for the whole year are available. We used data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) Short-Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF) data series to estimate life expectancy in 2020 for several countries. The changes estimated using these data and the appropriate methodology seem to be more pessimistic than those that have been proposed so far: life expectancy dropped in the Russia by 2.16 years, 1.85 in USA, and 1.27 in England and Wales. The differences among countries are substantial: many countries (e.g. Denmark, Island, Norway, New Zealand, South Korea) saw a rather limited drop in life expectancy or have even seen an increase in life expectancy."
https://openalex.org/W4210275199,"Infrared (IR) lasers are extensively utilized as an effective tool in many medical practices. Nevertheless, light penetration into the inspected tissue, which is highly affected by tissue optical properties, is a crucial factor for successful optical procedures. Although the optical properties are highly wavelength-dependent, they can be affected by the power of the incident laser. The present study demonstrates a considerable change in the scattering and absorption coefficients as a result of varying the incident laser power probing into biological samples at a constant laser wavelength (808 nm). The optical parameters were investigated using an integrating sphere and Kubelka-Munk model. Additionally, fluence distribution at the sample's surface was modeled using COMSOL-multiphysics software. The experimental results were validated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Monte-Carlo simulation. The results showed that tissue scattering coefficient decreases as the incident laser power increases while the absorption coefficient experienced a slight change. Moreover, the penetration depth increases with the optical parameters. The reduction in the scattering coefficients leads to wider and more diffusive fluence rate distribution at the tissue surface. The simulation results showed a good agreement with the experimental data and revealed that tissue anisotropy may be responsible for this scattering reduction. The present findings could be considered in order for the specialists to accurately specify the laser optical dose in various biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4210656939,"The speed of the economic downturn in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has been exceptional, causing mass layoffs-in Germany up to 30% of the workforce in some industries. Economic rationale suggests that the decision on which workers are fired should depend on productivity-related individual factors. However, from hiring situations we know that discrimination-i.e., decisions driven by characteristics unrelated to productivity-is widespread in Western labor markets. Drawing on representative survey data on forced layoffs and short-time work collected in Germany between April and December 2020, this study highlights that discrimination against immigrants is also present in firing situations. The analysis shows that employees with a migration background are significantly more likely to lose their job than native workers when otherwise healthy firms are unexpectedly forced to let go of part of their workforce, while firms make more efforts to substitute firing with short-time working schemes for their native workers. Adjusting for detailed job-related characteristics shows that the findings are unlikely to be driven by systematic differences in productivity between migrants and natives. Moreover, using industry-specific variation in the extent of the economic downturn, I demonstrate that layoff probabilities hardly differ across the less affected industries, but that the gap between migrants and natives increases with the magnitude of the shock. In the hardest-hit industries, job loss probability among migrants is three times higher than among natives. This confirms the hypothesis that firing discrimination puts additional pressure on the immigrant workforce in times of crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4210697254,"Siderophores are iron-chelating molecules that solubilize Fe3+ for microbial utilization and facilitate colonization or infection of eukaryotes by liberating host iron for bacterial uptake. By fluorescently labeling membrane receptors and binding proteins, we created 20 sensors that detect, discriminate, and quantify apo- and ferric siderophores. The sensor proteins originated from TonB-dependent ligand-gated porins (LGPs) of Escherichia coli (Fiu, FepA, Cir, FhuA, IutA, BtuB), Klebsiella pneumoniae (IroN, FepA, FyuA), Acinetobacter baumannii (PiuA, FepA, PirA, BauA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (FepA, FpvA), and Caulobacter crescentus (HutA) from a periplasmic E. coli binding protein (FepB) and from a human serum binding protein (siderocalin). They detected ferric catecholates (enterobactin, degraded enterobactin, glucosylated enterobactin, dihydroxybenzoate, dihydroxybenzoyl serine, cefidericol, MB-1), ferric hydroxamates (ferrichromes, aerobactin), mixed iron complexes (yersiniabactin, acinetobactin, pyoverdine), and porphyrins (hemin, vitamin B12). The sensors defined the specificities and corresponding affinities of the LGPs and binding proteins and monitored ferric siderophore and porphyrin transport by microbial pathogens. We also quantified, for the first time, broad recognition of diverse ferric complexes by some LGPs, as well as monospecificity for a single metal chelate by others. In addition to their primary ferric siderophore ligands, most LGPs bound the corresponding aposiderophore with ∼100-fold lower affinity. These sensors provide insights into ferric siderophore biosynthesis and uptake pathways in free-living, commensal, and pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4210317779,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have long been known as key drivers in the development and progression of diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and many other inflammatory and degenerative diseases, making them attractive potential drug targets. Engineering selective inhibitors based upon tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), endogenous human proteins that tightly yet nonspecifically bind to the family of MMPs, represents a promising new avenue for therapeutic development. Here, we used a counter-selective screening strategy for directed evolution of yeast-displayed human TIMP-1 to obtain TIMP-1 variants highly selective for the inhibition of MMP-3 in preference over MMP-10. As MMP-3 and MMP-10 are the most similar MMPs in sequence, structure, and function, our results thus clearly demonstrate the capability for engineering full-length TIMP proteins to be highly selective MMP inhibitors. We show using protein crystal structures and models of MMP-3-selective TIMP-1 variants bound to MMP-3 and counter-target MMP-10 how structural alterations within the N-terminal and C-terminal TIMP-1 domains create new favorable and selective interactions with MMP-3 and disrupt unique interactions with MMP-10. While our MMP-3-selective inhibitors may be of interest for future investigation in diseases where this enzyme drives pathology, our platform and screening strategy can be employed for developing selective inhibitors of additional MMPs implicated as therapeutic targets in disease."
https://openalex.org/W4210262782,"Phenotyping to quantify the total carotenoids content (TCC) is sensitive, time-consuming, tedious, and costly. The development of high-throughput phenotyping tools is essential for screening hundreds of cassava genotypes in a short period of time in the biofortification program. This study aimed to (i) use digital images to extract information on the pulp color of cassava roots and estimate correlations with TCC, and (ii) select predictive models for TCC using colorimetric indices. Red, green and blue images were captured in root samples from 228 biofortified genotypes and the difference in color was analyzed using L*, a*, b*, hue and chroma indices from the International Commission on Illumination (CIELAB) color system and lightness. Colorimetric data were used for principal component analysis (PCA), correlation and for developing prediction models for TCC based on regression and machine learning. A high positive correlation between TCC and the variables b* (r = 0.90) and chroma (r = 0.89) was identified, while the other correlations were median and negative, and the L* parameter did not present a significant correlation with TCC. In general, the accuracy of most prediction models (with all variables and only the most important ones) was high (R2 ranging from 0.81 to 0.94). However, the artificial neural network prediction model presented the best predictive ability (R2 = 0.94), associated with the smallest error in the TCC estimates (root-mean-square error of 0.24). The structure of the studied population revealed five groups and high genetic variability based on PCA regarding colorimetric indices and TCC. Our results demonstrated that the use of data obtained from digital image analysis is an economical, fast, and effective alternative for the development of TCC phenotyping tools in cassava roots with high predictive ability."

We performed a sanitary surveillance at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) in Milan over a 17 months period. Pre-vaccination, in 1,493 participants, we scored 266 infections (17.8%) and 8 possible reinfections (3%). Post-vaccination, we identified 30 infections in 2,029 vaccinated individuals (1.5%). We report that the probability of infection post-vaccination is i) significantly lower compared to natural infection, ii) associated with a significantly shorter median duration of infection than that of first infection and reinfection, iii) anticorrelated with circulating antibody levels."
https://openalex.org/W4210316101,"The aim of this article is to assess both the economic and social value of balneotherapy and spa tourism, being the first paper in carrying out this analysis. The study has been conducted in Maresme, a region of Catalonia, Spain. On the one hand, an Input-Output (IO) model with a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) has been carried out to assess the economic value. On the other hand, a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) has been used to monetise the social value in this region, taking into account, among other concepts, direct and indirect health profits, given that balneotherapy helps to alleviate various diseases. The results show that whereas the economic multiplier is 1.529 considering the direct and indirect effects and 1.712 taking into account also the induced effects, which are similar to health and medical tourism multipliers, social value generates additional positive value, given that the cost-benefit ratio is 1.858. The theoretical implications of the paper as well as the findings' implications for policy so as to encourage investments in spa tourism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4210658152,"Rhizosphere and endophytic microbiota significantly affect plant growth and development by influencing nutrient uptake and stress tolerance. Herein, root and rhizosphere soil of Acacia species were collected and analyzed to compare the structural differences of the rhizosphere and root endophytic bacterial communities. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology was employed to analyze the rhizosphere and root endophytic bacterial communities. A total of 4249 OTUs were identified following sequence analysis. The rhizosphere soil contained significantly more OTUs than the root soil. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that bacterial communities exhibited significant specificity in the rhizosphere and root soil of different Acacia species. The most dominant phylum in the rhizosphere soil was Acidobacteria, followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, whereas the dominant phylum in the root soil was Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria. Among the various Acacia species, specific bacterial communities displayed different abundance. We systematically described the core bacteria in the rhizosphere and root endophytic bacterial communities and predicted their relevant functions. The type and abundance of specific bacteria were correlated with the nutrient absorption and metabolism of the Acacia species. This study addresses the complex host-microbe interactions and explores the rhizosphere and root bacterial community structure of different Acacia species. These results provide new insights into the role of rhizosphere and root endophytic bacterial communities on the growth and reproduction of Acacia , thus informing future efforts towards sustainable development and utilization of Acacia ."
https://openalex.org/W4210258960,"Many pathogens and parasites have evolved to overwhelm and suppress their host's immune system. Nevertheless, the interactive effects of these agents on colony productivity and wintering success have been relatively unexplored, particularly in large-scale phenomic studies. As a defense mechanism, honey bees have evolved remarkable social behaviors to defend against pathogen and parasite challenges, which reduce the impact of disease and improve colony health. To investigate the complex role of pathogens, parasites and social immunity behaviors in relation to colony productivity and outcomes, we extensively studied colonies at several locations across Canada for two years. In 2016 and 2017, colonies founded with 1-year-old queens of diverse genetic origin were evaluated, which represented a generalized subset of the Canadian bee population. During each experimental year (May through April), we collected phenotypic data and sampled colonies for pathogen analysis in a standardized manner. Measures included: colony size and productivity (colony weight, cluster size, honey production, and sealed brood population), social immunity traits (hygienic behavior, instantaneous mite population growth rate, and grooming behavior), as well as quantification of gut parasites (Nosema spp., and Lotmaria passim), viruses (DWV-A, DWV-B, BQCV and SBV) and external parasites (Varroa destructor). Our goal was to examine: 1) correlations between pathogens and colony phenotypes; 2) the dynamics of pathogens and parasites on colony phenotypes and productivity traits; and 3) the effects of social immunity behaviors on colony pathogen load. Our results show that colonies expressing high levels of some social immunity behaviors were associated with low levels of pathogens/parasites, including viruses, Nosema spp., and V. destructor. In addition, we determined that elevated viral and Nosema spp. levels were associated with low levels of colony productivity, and that five out of six pathogenic factors measured were negatively associated with colony size and weight in both fall and spring periods. Finally, this study also provides information about the incidence and abundance of pathogens, colony phenotypes, and further disentangles their inter-correlation, so as to better understand drivers of honey bee colony health and productivity."
https://openalex.org/W4210343380,"Peripheral venous cannulation is one of the most common procedures in medicine. It is associated with noticeable pain and apprehension, although in most cases it is performed without any anesthesia due to lack of a painless, cost-effective option, which would provide rapid local anesthesia with subsequent significant reduction in the experienced pain. We conducted an open-label placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 2% lidocaine injection using the commercially available microneedle device MinronJet600 (NanoPass Technologies Ltd, Israel) to achieve rapid local anesthesia prior to peripheral venous cannulation.One hundred and two subjects were randomly allocated into two groups. In the first group, 100μL of lidocaine hydrochloride (2%) was injected intradermally to subjects using the MicronJet600 device in the left arm (MJ-Lido) and 100μL of saline was injected intradermally using the device in the right arm (MJ-Saline). In the second group, 100μL of lidocaine hydrochloride (2%) was injected using the MicronJet600 device into the left arm (MJ-Lido), with no injection into the right arm of subjects (No pretreatment). In both groups the intradermal injection was performed at the cannulation site prior to insertion of a 18G cannula into a median cubital vein in both arms. As a primary variable, a score of cannulation-induced pain was indicated by subjects using a 100-point visual analog scale immediately after cannulation. As a secondary variable, subjects in Group 2 also indicated their preference to receive the anaesthetic injection with MicronJet600 in the future by using the 5-point Likert scale. Also, as a secondary variable, the duration of skin numbness after lidocaine injection was indicated by performing a superficial pin-prick with a 27G needle at 15, 30 and 45 minutes, at distances of 1, 2 and 3 centimeters from the injection site.A significant pain reduction (11.0-fold) was achieved due to the lidocaine injection compared to the cannulation without any pretreatment (p< 0.005). After the lidocaine injection the anesthesia was effective up to 2 centimeters from the injection site and remained for up to 30 minutes. Eighty percent of subjects from the second group preferred cannulation after the lidocaine injection over cannulation without any pretreatment. No significant side effects were identified.Intradermal injection of anaesthetic with Micronjet600 was found to be a safe and effective option for providing rapid local anesthesia for peripheral intravenous cannulation.The clinical trial was registered, before the patient enrollment began, in the Research Registry publicly accessible database (registration identifier: researchregistry4662). Also, the trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (registration identifier: NCT05108714) after its completion."

https://openalex.org/W4210695580,"Anomaly detection in network traffic is becoming a challenging task due to the complexity of large-scale networks and the proliferation of various social network applications. In the actual industrial environment, only recently obtained unlabelled data can be used as the training set. The accuracy of the abnormal ratio in the training set as prior knowledge has a great influence on the performance of the commonly used unsupervised algorithms. In this study, an anomaly detection algorithm based on X-means and iForest is proposed, named X-iForest, which clusters the standard Euclidean distance between the abnormal points and the normal cluster centre to achieve secondary filtering by using X-means. We compared X-iForest with seven mainstream unsupervised algorithms in terms of the AUC and anomaly detection rates. A large number of experiments showed that X-iForest has notable advantages over other algorithms and can be well applied to anomaly detection of large-scale network traffic data."

However, the evidence base to inform women’s rugby league remains sparse. This study provides the largest quantification of anthropometric and physical qualities of women’s rugby league players to date, identifying differences between positions (forwards &amp; backs) and playing level (Women’s Super League [WSL] vs. International). The height, weight, body composition, lower body strength, jump height, speed and aerobic capacity of 207 players were quantified during the pre-season period. Linear mixed models and effects sizes were used to determine differences between positions and levels. Forwards were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) heavier (forwards: 82.5 ± 14.8kg; backs: 67.7 ± 9.2kg) and have a greater body fat % (forwards: 37.7 ± 6.9%; backs: 30.4 ± 6.3%) than backs. Backs had significantly greater lower body power measured via jump height (forwards: 23.5 ± 4.4cm; backs: 27.6 ± 4.9cm), speed over 10m (forwards: 2.12 ± 0.14s; backs: 1.98 ± 0.11s), 20m (forwards: 3.71 ± 0.27s; backs: 3.46 ± 0.20s), 30m (forwards: 5.29 ± 0.41s; backs: 4.90 ± 0.33s), 40m (forwards: 6.91 ± 0.61s; backs: 6.33 ± 0.46s) and aerobic capacity (forwards: 453.4 ± 258.8m; backs: 665.0 ± 298.2m) than forwards. Additionally, international players were found to have greater anthropometric and physical qualities in comparison to their WSL counterparts. This study adds to the limited evidence base surrounding the anthropometric and physical qualities of elite women’s rugby league players. Comparative values for anthropometric and physical qualities are provided which practitioners may use to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of players, informing training programs to prepare players for the demands of women’s rugby league."
https://openalex.org/W4210308869,"Information sharing via social networking systems (SNS) is a common practice among academics, as well as others, that brings substantial benefits. At the same time, privacy concerns are widespread among SNS users, which may tend to inhibit their maximising the benefit from using the systems. This paper investigates the proposition that SNS user attitudes and behaviour are affected by privacy concerns, and that the effects are subject to significant cultural factors. A broad assessment of the literature provides the context for the study. Working in the context of Saudi Arabia, we apply a mixed-methods approach beginning with in-depth interviews, exposing in detail a range of views and concerns about privacy and SNS use, also allowing us to identify three key factors that bear on SNS usage and users' concerns. Analysis of these factors in the light of the ""theory of reasoned action"" derives a structural model predicting several hypotheses relating the factors and users' attitudes and behaviour. We assess the model through development of a questionnaire, administered to a large pool of academic participants, that allows us to examine how the model responds in general, and via multigroup partial least squares analyses, differentially to gender and to culturally distinct (Arab vs. non-Arab) constituents of the participant group. Results show good support for the hypotheses and clear gender and culture effects. Picking up issues from the interviews, discussion focuses on users' views about SNS providers' privacy policies and their inadequacy regarding culturally specific ethical concerns. We argue that these views may reflect different regulatory environments in combination with other cultural factors."
https://openalex.org/W4210323801,"We aimed to explore the synergistic combination of a topologically invariant Betti number (BN)-based signature and a biomarker for the accurate prediction of symptomatic (grade ≥2) radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP+) before stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung cancer.A total of 272 SABR cases with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer were chosen for this study. The occurrence of RP+ was predicted using a support vector machine (SVM) model trained with the combined features of the BN-based signature extracted from planning computed tomography (pCT) images and a pretreatment biomarker, serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (BN+KL-6 model). In all, 242 (20 RP+ and 222 RP-(grade 1)) and 30 cases (8 RP+ and 22 RP-) were used for training and testing the model, respectively. The BN-based features were extracted from BN maps that characterize topologically invariant heterogeneous traits of potential RP+ lung regions on pCT images by applying histogram- and texture-based feature calculations to the maps. The SVM models were built to predict RP+ patients with a BN signature that was constructed based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression model. The evaluation of the prediction models was performed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and accuracy in the test. The performance of the BN+KL-6 model was compared to the performance based on the BN, conventional original pCT, and wavelet decomposition (WD) models.The test AUCs obtained for the BN+KL-6, BN, pCT, and WD models were 0.825, 0.807, 0.642, and 0.545, respectively. The accuracies of the BN+KL-6, BN, pCT, and WD models were found to be 0.724, 0.708, 0.591, and 0.534, respectively.This study demonstrated the comprehensive performance of the BN+KL-6 model for the prediction of potential RP+ patients before SABR for lung cancer."

This study adopts the data-driven approach to assess the QT prolongation risk of all the frequently used drugs in a tertiary teaching hospital using both standard 12-lead ECGs and intensive care unit (ICU) continuous ECGs. We used the standard 12-lead ECG results (n = 1,040,752) measured in the hospital during 1994-2019 and the continuous ECG results (n = 4,835) extracted from the ICU's patient-monitoring devices during 2016-2019. Based on the drug prescription frequency, 167 drugs were analyzed using 12-lead ECG data under the case-control study design and 60 using continuous ECG data under the retrospective cohort study design. Whereas the case-control study yielded the odds ratio, the cohort study generated the hazard ratio for each candidate drug. Further, we observed the possibility of inducing QT prolongation in 38 drugs in the 12-lead ECG analysis and 7 drugs in the continuous ECG analysis. The seven drugs (vasopressin, vecuronium, midazolam, levetiracetam, ipratropium bromide, nifedipine, and chlorpheniramine) that showed a significantly higher risk of QT prolongation in the continuous ECG analysis were also identified in the 12-lead ECG data analysis. The use of two different ECG sources enabled us to confidently assess drug-induced QT prolongation risk in clinical practice. In this study, seven drugs showed QT prolongation risk in both study designs."
https://openalex.org/W4210530887,"Background Adolescent e-cigarette use has increased dramatically. Most e-cigarette liquids contain nicotine, which can harm the developing adolescent brain. Local studies examining the risk factors of adolescent e-cigarette use and interactions between its risk factors are limited. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of current e-cigarette use and its associated factors among in-school adolescents in West Malaysia. We also examined the possible sociodemographic characteristic, lifestyle risk behaviour and parental factor interactions that affect the probability of current e-cigarette use. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2017. Respondents aged 13–18 years were included in the study. The data were analysed using STATA (v.15). Results The prevalence of current e-cigarette use was 9.1%. Male gender, older age, Malay ethnicity, schooling in urban area, current smoking, current alcohol use, current drug use, having parents that are not married and living together and parental tobacco product use were significantly associated with current e-cigarette use. There were significant interactions between: i) gender with age, ethnicity, current smoking, current alcohol use and current drug use, ii) ethnicity with current smoking and current alcohol use, iii) locality with ethnicity, current smoking and current alcohol use, iv) current drug use with age, ethnicity, current smoking and current alcohol use, v) parental marital status with gender, age and ethnicity, and vi) parental tobacco use with ethnicity and current smoking. Conclusion Our findings identify significant associations between sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle risk behaviours and parental factors with current e-cigarette use. They also provide new insight into the interactions between these factors that affect the probability of current e-cigarette use among West Malaysian adolescents. Efforts to tackle e-cigarette use in Malaysian adolescents should target sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle risk behaviours and parental factors such as smoking cessation intervention for parents."

https://openalex.org/W4210626596,"Fludioxonil and iprodione are effective fungicides widely used for crop protection and are essential for controlling plant pathogenic fungi. The emergence of fungicide-resistant strains of targeted pathogens is regularly monitored, and several cases have been reported. Non-targeted fungi may also be exposed to the fungicide residues in agricultural fields. However, there are no comprehensive reports on fungicide-resistant strains of non-targeted fungi. Here, we surveyed 99 strains, representing 12 Penicillium species, that were isolated from a variety of environments, including foods, dead bodies, and clinical samples. Among the Penicillium strains, including non-pathogenic P. chrysogenum and P. camembertii, as well as postharvest pathogens P. expansum and P. digitatum, 14 and 20 showed resistance to fludioxonil and iprodione, respectively, and 6 showed multi-drug resistance to the fungicides. Sequence analyses revealed that some strains of P. chrysogenum and Penicillium oxalicum had mutations in NikA, a group III histidine kinase of the high-osmolarity glycerol pathway, which is the mode of action for fludioxonil and iprodione. The single nucleotide polymorphisms of G693D and T1318P in P. chrysogenum and T960S in P. oxalicum were only present in the fludioxonil- or iprodione-resistant strains. These strains also exhibited resistance to pyrrolnitrin, which is the lead compound in fludioxonil and is naturally produced by some Pseudomonas species. This study demonstrated that non-targeted Penicillium strains distributed throughout the environment possess fungicide resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4210632929,"Cell division cycle-associated 8 (CDCA8) is a component of chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) that participates in mitotic regulation. Although cancer-related CDCA8 hyperactivation has been widely observed, its molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that CDCA8 overexpression maintains tumorigenicity and is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Notably, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is identified to be responsible for CDCA8 activation in PCa. Genome-wide assays revealed that EZH2-induced H3K27 trimethylation represses let-7b expression and thus protects the let-7b-targeting CDCA8 transcripts. More importantly, EZH2 facilitates the self-activation of E2F1 by recruiting E2F1 to its own promoter region in a methylation-independent manner. The high level of E2F1 further promotes transcription of CDCA8 along with the other CPC subunits. Taken together, our study suggests that EZH2-mediated cell cycle regulation in PCa relies on both its methyltransferase and non-methyltransferase activities."

In the present study, we hypothesized that d-allulose is effective in attenuating the progression of diabetic nephropathy in the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Drinking water with or without 3% d-allulose was administered to OLETF rats for 13 weeks. Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats that received drinking water without d-allulose were used as non-diabetic control rats. d-allulose significantly attenuated the increase in blood glucose levels and progressive mesangial expansion in the glomerulus, which is regarded as a characteristic of diabetic nephropathy, in OLETF rats. d-allulose also attenuated the significant increases in renal IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA levels in OLETF rats, which is a proinflammatory parameter. Additionally, we showed that d-allulose suppresses mesangial matrix expansion, but its correlation with suppressing renal inflammation in OLETF rats should be investigated further. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that d-allulose can prevent diabetic nephropathy in rats."

Mouse polyclonal anti-NA sera and a monoclonal antibody could block initial viral entry into HAE cells as well as egress from the cell surface. NA-specific polyclonal serum also reduced virus replication across multiple rounds of infection. Restriction of virus entry correlated with the ability of the serum or monoclonal antibody to mediate neuraminidase inhibition (NI).

The alveolar subtype (ARMS) has the poorest prognosis and represents the greatest unmet medical need for RMS. Emerging evidence supports the role of epigenetic dysregulation in RMS. Here we show that SMARCA4/BRG1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme of the SWI/SNF complex, is prominently expressed in primary tumors from ARMS patients and cell cultures. Our validation studies for a CRISPR screen of 400 epigenetic targets identified SMARCA4 as a unique factor for long-term (but not short-term) tumor cell survival in ARMS. A SMARCA4/SMARCA2 protein degrader (ACBI-1) demonstrated similar long-term tumor cell dependence in vitro and in vivo. These results credential SMARCA4 as a tumor cell dependency factor and a therapeutic target in ARMS."
https://openalex.org/W4210668942,"The development of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) vaccine has been hampered by the risk of enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) which was induced by highly skewed toward Th2 immune response. In our previous study, we expressed the recombinant pre-F protein using Escherichia coli BL21, called RBF. To verify if the RBF protein could cause ERD, we tested the immunogenicity and safety of RBF with a commercial alum adjuvant (GMP-grade Adju-Phos). RBF alone and RBF/Adju-Phos elicited long-lasting protective antibodies and a cellular immune response in mice after three immunizations. Unfortunately, compared with the mice in RBF group, mice in RBF/Adju-Phos generated a serious Th2 humoral immune response that elicited Th2-mediated lung pathology. From the IL-4+:IFNγ+ ratio, there was also a robust Th2 cellullar immunologic response in the RBF/Adju-Phos group. This study demonstrates that it may not be enough for RBF to increase the titer of neutralizing antibodies. A balanced immune response must be induced for hRSV vaccine safety."
https://openalex.org/W4225820501,"The testosterone to estradiol ratio (T/E2 ratio) reportedly exerts a stronger effect on semen quality and sexual desire than does testosterone alone. Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has long been used as an empirical treatment option in the management of idiopathic oligozoospermia. Clomiphene may change the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis and result in the alteration of the T/E2 ratio. No reliable data are available regarding the change in the T/E2 ratio after clomiphene use in eugonadism.This study included 24 male patients who were diagnosed with idiopathic infertility with eugonadism. They all received clomiphene citrate (25 mg/day) as empirical treatment. Blood tests for serum testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone were performed before and after 4 weeks of clomiphene use. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate the significance of the hormone level change.Overall, the patients' T/E2 ratio did not increase significantly after clomiphene use. In the subgroup analysis, the T/E2 ratio of patients with a baseline ratio of <200 increased significantly after clomiphene use.Clomiphene citrate may significantly increase the T/E2 ratio in eugonadal men under the premise of its ceiling effect (T/E2 ratio < 200), providing practitioners with guidance on the use of clomiphene in this demographic."
https://openalex.org/W4226154617,"Background Insufficient milk production is a common problem affecting breastfeeding women, in particular following Cesarean delivery. Wang Nam Yen herbal tea is a promising traditional Thai medicine used by postpartum women to stimulate milk production, as an alternative to pharmaceutical galactagogues. We aimed to compare the efficacy of Wang Nam Yen herbal tea, domperidone, and placebo, in increasing milk production in mothers who underwent Cesarean delivery. Methods Women who underwent uncomplicated cesarean delivery at Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital were randomized into three groups. The participants received the treatments daily for three consecutive days. The primary outcome was breast milk volume at 72 hours after delivery. Secondary outcomes were pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, adverse events, and participant satisfaction. Results Of the 1,450 pregnant women that underwent cesarean delivery, 120 women were enrolled. Their mean age and gestational ages were 28.7 years and 38.4 weeks, respectively. Breast milk volume at 72 hours postpartum was significantly different among the three groups ( p = 0.030). The post hoc Bonferroni correction indicated a significant difference in breast milk volume between Wang Nam Yen herbal tea group and placebo control group ( p = 0.007) while there was no difference between Wang Nam Yen herbal tea group and domperidone group ( p = 0.806) and between domperidone group and placebo control group ( p = 0.018). There was no difference in pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, adverse events, and participant satisfaction among the three groups. Conclusion Wang Nam Yen herbal tea was effective in augmenting breast milk production at 72 hours postpartum in mothers following cesarean delivery, and there was no evidence that herbal tea and domperidone differed in terms of augmenting breast milk production. Trial registration The study was approved by the institutional review board of Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital (No.061/2559) and was registered TCTR20170811003 with the Thai Clinical Trial Registry."
https://openalex.org/W4210280410,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that play a critical role in innate immune diseases. TLR3, which is localized in the endosomal compartments of hematopoietic immune cells, is able to recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) derived from viruses and bacteria and thereby induce innate immune responses. Inflammatory periodontal bone resorption is caused by bacterial infections, which initially is regulated by innate immunity; however, the roles of TLR3 signaling in bone resorption are still not known. We examined the roles of TLR3 signaling in bone resorption using poly(I:C), a synthetic dsRNA analog. In cocultures of mouse bone marrow cells and stromal osteoblasts, poly(I:C) clearly induced osteoclast differentiation. In osteoblasts, poly(I:C) increased PGE2 production and upregulated the mRNA expression of PGE2-related genes, Ptgs2 and Ptges, as well as that of a gene related to osteoclast differentiation, Tnfsf11. In addition, we found that indomethacin (a COX-2 inhibitor) or an antagonist of the PGE2 receptor EP4 attenuated the poly(I:C)-induced PGE2 production and subsequent Tnfsf11 expression. Poly(I:C) also prolonged the survival of the mature osteoclasts associated with the increased mRNA expression of osteoclast marker genes, Nfatc1 and Ctsk. In ex vivo organ cultures of periodontal alveolar bone, poly(I:C) induced bone-resorbing activity in a dose-dependent manner, which was attenuated by the simultaneous administration of either indomethacin or an EP4 antagonist. These data suggest that TLR3 signaling in osteoblasts controls PGE2 production and induces the subsequent differentiation and survival of mature osteoclasts. Endogenous TLR3 in stromal osteoblasts and osteoclasts synergistically induces inflammatory alveolar bone resorption in periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W4210362916,"Rice production is affected by many biotic and abiotic stresses; among them, bacterial blight (BB) and blast diseases and low soil phosphorous stress cause significant yield losses. The present study was carried out with the objective of combining the BB resistance gene, Xa21, the blast resistance gene, Pi54, and the low soil phosphorous tolerance QTL/gene, Pup1, into the genetic background of the Indian mega-rice variety, MTU1010 (Cottondora Sannalu), through marker-assisted pedigree breeding. RP5973-20-9-8-24-12-7 [a near isogenic line (NIL) of MTU1010 possessing Pup1] and RP6132 [a NIL of Akshayadhan possessing Xa21 + Pi54] were crossed and 'true' F1s were identified, using the target gene-specific markers and selfed. F2 plants, which are homozygous for all the three target genes/QTLs, were identified using PCR based markers and were advanced further through the pedigree method of breeding, with selection based on phenotypic traits specific for MTU1010. At the F5 generation, a set of 15 promising triple positive homozygous lines were identified and screened for their resistance against BB and blast diseases and tolerance to low soil P. Among them, two lines (LPK 30-18-16 and LPK 49-15-22) showed higher yields as compared to MTU1010, along with the desirable long slender grain type in both low soil P and normal soil P plots, and also exhibited high levels of resistance against BB and blast diseases, with lesser grain shattering as compared to MTU1010. These lines are being advanced for multi-location trials for validating their performance."

In the present study, a blend of strains from Cercospora coffeicola was inoculated into 19 Brazilian commercial cultivars and 41 accessions from the Germplasm Collection of Minas Gerais to evaluate the genetic resistance ability within the population and select superior genotypes for the breeding program. After predicting the genotypic values of the estudied material, the evaluations number necessary for selecting genotypes with accuracy and efficiency was determined based on the data of severity to BES. The action of defense mechanisms plant was also investigated by assessing the levels of total soluble phenolic compounds and soluble lignin in contrasting genotypes for disease susceptibility. Based on the results, the accession MG 1207 Sumatra, had an intrinsic genetic capacity to maintain low levels of severity to BES. The genotype MG 1207 Sumatra can substantially contribute to the development of new cultivars, which may lead to the reduced use of pesticides. According to the accuracy and efficiency results obtained, four evaluations BES severity are sufficient to achieve accuracy, providing expressive genetic gains. Finally, the levels of lignin and phenolic compounds were not found to be associated with the resistance of coffee genotypes to BES."
https://openalex.org/W4210565413,"We aimed to investigate and compare activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL (IADL), poor self-rated health and the health behaviours among immigrants and the native population in Norway. We present results from analysis of two Norwegian surveys, (Living Conditions Survey on Health from 2015, Living Conditions Survey among Immigrants 2016). Using logistic regression models, odds ratios were estimated for functional ability, self-reported health, and health behavior among immigrants, with Norwegian born being the reference category. The first model was controlled for age and gender and the second model was additionally adjusted for educational level. Our analysis included 5343 participants, 2853 men (913 immigrants), and 2481 women (603 immigrants), aged 45–79 years. The age-group 45–66 years includes n = 4187 (immigrants n = 1431, men n = 856; women n = 575) and 67–79 years n = 1147 (immigrants n = 85, men n = 57; women n = 28). The percentage of Norwegians having ≥ 14 years of education was 86%, as compared to 56% among immigrants. The percentage of immigrants with no education at all was 11%. The employment rate among the Norwegian eldest age group was nearly double (14%) as compared to the immigrant group. Adjusted for age, gender and education, immigrants had higher odds than Norwegian of ADL and IADL, chronic diseases and overweight. There were no differences between immigrants and Norwegians in prevalence of poor self-reported health and smoking. Overall elderly immigrants are worse-off than Norwegians in parameters of health and functioning. Knowledge about health and functioning of elderly immigrants can provide a basis for evidence-based policies and interventions to ensure the best possible health for a growing number of elderly immigrants. Furthermore, for a better surveillance, planning of programs, making policies, decisions and improved assessment and implementation, ADL and IADLs limitations should be included as a variable in public health studies."
https://openalex.org/W4210581471,"Recent work has unearthed many empirical regularities in mortality trends, including the inverse correlation between life expectancy and life span inequality, and the compression of mortality into older age ranges. These regularities have furnished important insights into the dynamics of mortality by describing, in demographic terms, how different attributes of the life table deaths distribution interrelate and change over time. However, though empirical evidence suggests that the demographically-meaningful metrics these regularities involve (e.g., life span disparity and life table entropy) are correlated to the moments of the deaths distribution (e.g., variance), the broader theoretical connections between life span inequality and the moments of the deaths distribution have yet to be elucidated. In this article we establish such connections and leverage them to furnish new insights into mortality dynamics. We prove theoretical results linking life span disparity and life table entropy to the central moments of the deaths distribution, and use these results to empirically link statistical measures of variation of the deaths distribution (e.g., variance, index of dispersion) to life span disparity and life table entropy. We validate these results via empirical analyses using data from the Human Mortality Database and extract from them several new insights into mortality shifting and compression in human populations."
https://openalex.org/W4210600051,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are widely used in genome-wide association studies and population genetics analyses. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become convenient, and many SNP-calling pipelines have been developed for human NGS data. We took advantage of a gap knowledge in selecting the appropriated SNP calling pipeline to handle with high-throughput NGS data. To fill this gap, we studied and compared seven SNP calling pipelines, which include 16GT, genome analysis toolkit (GATK), Bcftools-single (Bcftools single sample mode), Bcftools-multiple (Bcftools multiple sample mode), VarScan2-single (VarScan2 single sample mode), VarScan2-multiple (VarScan2 multiple sample mode) and Freebayes pipelines, using 96 NGS data with the different depth gradients of approximately 5X, 10X, 20X, 30X, 40X, and 50X coverage from 16 Rhode Island Red chickens. The sixteen chickens were also genotyped with a 50K SNP array, and the sensitivity and specificity of each pipeline were assessed by comparison to the results of SNP arrays. For each pipeline, except Freebayes, the number of detected SNPs increased as the input read depth increased. In comparison with other pipelines, 16GT, followed by Bcftools-multiple, obtained the most SNPs when the input coverage exceeded 10X, and Bcftools-multiple obtained the most when the input was 5X and 10X. The sensitivity and specificity of each pipeline increased with increasing input. Bcftools-multiple had the highest sensitivity numerically when the input ranged from 5X to 30X, and 16GT showed the highest sensitivity when the input was 40X and 50X. Bcftools-multiple also had the highest specificity, followed by GATK, at almost all input levels. For most calling pipelines, there were no obvious changes in SNP numbers, sensitivities or specificities beyond 20X. In conclusion, (1) if only SNPs were detected, the sequencing depth did not need to exceed 20X; (2) the Bcftools-multiple may be the best choice for detecting SNPs from chicken NGS data, but for a single sample or sequencing depth greater than 20X, 16GT was recommended. Our findings provide a reference for researchers to select suitable pipelines to obtain SNPs from the NGS data of chickens or nonhuman animals."
https://openalex.org/W4210603909,"Metamorphosis in the insect larva is associated with disintegration, engulf and digestion of larval tissues. These processes are accompanied by a significant shift in physiological parameters like high activity of hydrolytic enzymes and decrease of pH. In the way, the metamorphosing larva resembles the processes occurring in the wound at the stage of inflammation. Based on this thesis, we put forward the idea of the possibility of using insect phagocytes in the wound treatment. The search for a suitable insect cell line and the study of its properties were the purpose of the work. The abilities of insect phagocytes to retain viability and functional activity under conditions physiological for humans were also investigated. We found that blue blowfly Calliphora vicina larvae had histolysocytes, a specialized population of professional phagocytes involved in the histolysis. In vitro, histolysocytes possess high phagocytic activity to fragments of vertebrate soft tissues and debris. These cells retain viability and functional activity for a long time under conditions that are physiological for vertebrate cells. Moreover histolysocytes can realize the humoral control over the bacteria through the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. So histolysocytes have the potential to be used as xenogeneic phagocytes in the wound treatment. The data obtained allow proceeding to experiments on laboratory animals for studying the effect of such therapy on the wound healing process."
https://openalex.org/W4210798781,"To establish the factorial structure and internal consistency of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) in parents, the level and correlates of problematic internet use, and patterns and types of screen use.Data were collected through an online questionnaire about preconception health among Canadian women and men with ≥1 child. The questionnaire included the IAT and questions about time spent on screens by device type, use of screens during meals and in the bedroom, and perceptions of overuse. Factor analysis was completed to determine the factorial structure of the IAT, with multivariable linear regression used to determine correlates of the IAT.The sample included 1,156 respondents (mean age: 34.3 years; 83.1% female). The IAT had two factors: ""impairment in time management"" and ""impairment in socio-emotional functioning"" of which respondents had more impairment in time management than socio-emotional functioning. Based on the original IAT, 19.4% of respondents would be classified as having a mild internet use problem with 3.0% having a moderate or severe issue. In the multivariable model, perceived stress (b = .28, SE = .05, p < .001) and depressive symptoms (b = .24, SE = .10, p = .017) were associated with higher IAT scores. Handheld mobile devices were the most common type of screen used (mean = 3 hours/day) followed by watching television (mean = 2 hours/day).Parents spent a significant portion of their time each day using screens, particularly handheld mobile devices. The disruption caused by mobile devices may hinder opportunities for positive parent-child interactions, demonstrating the need for resources to support parents ever-growing use of technologies."
https://openalex.org/W4210415854,"Previous research provides evidence of maternally transmitted body-related attentional biases in female adolescents. In contrast, it remains unclear whether a familial transmission of body-related attentional biases also exists within father-son dyads. Therefore, the current study examined n = 42 male adolescents and their fathers with respect to direct and indirect paternal influences on body-related attention patterns and specific body-related concerns in sons. Besides completing specific body image questionnaires, participants were shown pictures of their own and a respective peer's body, while their eye movements were tracked. The fathers additionally viewed the body pictures of their own son and an adolescent peer. Contrary to the assumed direct and indirect paternal transmission processes, the sons' body-related attention patterns were not significantly associated with the perceived amount of paternal body-related feedback, with the fathers' attention patterns towards their own son's and the adolescent peer's body, or with the fathers' attention patterns towards their own and the adult peer's body. Similarly, no significant associations were found between direct or indirect paternal influences and the sons' drives for muscularity and thinness, body dissatisfaction, and muscularity-related body-checking behavior. Comparing the present findings with previous research indicating a maternal transmission of body-related attentional biases and body-related concerns in female adolescents, alternative (not gender-linked) familial transmission processes, e.g., via one's own mother, or a comparatively higher relevance of other sociocultural influences, e.g., via peers or the media, might be assumed for male adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4210459010,"Poeciliopsis (Cyprinodontiformes: Poeciliidae) is a genus comprised of 25 species of freshwater fishes. Several well-known taxonomic uncertainties exist within the genus, especially in relation to the taxonomic status of Poeciliopsis pleurospilus and P. gracilis. However, to date, no studies have been conducted to specifically address the taxonomic status of these two species. The goal of this study was to examine the taxonomic validity of P. pleurospilus and P. gracilis using genomic data (ddRADseq) in phylogenetic, population genetic, and species delimitation frameworks. Multiple analyses support the recognition of both taxa as distinct species and also permits us to revise their respective distributions. A species delimitation analysis indicates that P. pleurospilus and P. gracilis are distinct species, each of which consists of two distinct lineages that are geographically structured. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses provide clear evidence that individuals of P. gracilis are distributed north and west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in both Pacific and Atlantic river systems in Mexico, whereas individuals of P. pleurospilus are distributed in both Atlantic and Pacific river systems south and east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, from southern Mexico to Honduras."

https://openalex.org/W4210531601,"Maternal education is universally recognised as a major factor in positive societal indicators (health, wellbeing, overall education, etc.) and a country's growth and economic sustainability, yet the underlying factors contributing to maternal education have not been widely investigated, especially in developing countries.This study investigated the 15-year trend of maternal education in Bangladesh (2004-2018) to identify the factors contributing to maternal education.This study used publicly available cross-data from five consecutive Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (2004, 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2018). Level of maternal education was grouped as 'no education', 'incomplete primary', 'complete primary', 'incomplete secondary', 'complete secondary' and 'higher education' (reference group). The differences in factors/exposure variables suspected to contribute to maternal education were measured for these groups for 2004-2018, and a survey multinomial logistic regression was performed to estimate the explanatory value of these factors.From 2004-2018, there was a 62% gross reduction of the no education group and a 61% gross increase in the higher education group. A gross increase was also observed for complete secondary (49%), incomplete secondary (39%) and complete primary education (14%). In multivariate analysis, in rural areas, in 2018, the probability of a woman being in the complete primary, incomplete primary or no education groups was increased (adjusted relative risk ratio: 1.21, 1.40 and 1.59), compared to 2004 (0.73, 1.09, 1.12), respectively. From 2004-2018, the factor of no television watching reduced the probability of maternal education levels. Having a husband/partner who had no education increased the probability of a woman's education level. The probability of all maternal education levels decreased across all wealth index groups.The data suggest that average maternal education level in Bangladesh increased from 2004-2018. However, an integrated effort is required to improve factors associated with maternal education to both increase maternal education and Bangladesh's long-term sustainability."

Here we tested whether cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus, which show generalised rule learning in an ecologically relevant context; they generalise that any predator may provide protection from being chased by other fish; can also learn a general concept when presented with abstract cues. We tested for this ability in the matching-to-sample task. In this task, a sample is shown first, and then the subject needs to choose the matching sample over a simultaneously presented different one in order to obtain a food reward. We used the most general form of the task, using each stimulus only once in a total of 200 trials. As a group, the six subjects performed above chance, and four individuals eventually reached learning criteria. However, individual performance was rather unstable, yielding overall only 57% correct choices. These results add to the growing literature that ectotherms show the ability of abstract concept learning, though the lack of stable high performance may indicate quantitative performance differences to endotherms."

Serological testing was conducted on 709 individuals. Concordance metrics were estimated. Logistic regression was used to assess associations with seropositivity. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 63.5% (450/709; 95% CI 59.8%-67.0%) using the BioMedomics assay and 71.9% (510/709; 95% CI 68.5%-75.2%) using the Elecsys assay. There were 60 discordant results between the two assays, all of which were seropositive in the Elecsys assay, but seronegative in the BioMedomics assay. Overall, positive, and negative percent agreements between the two assays were 91.5% (95% CI 89.2%-93.5%), 88.2% (95% CI 85.1%-90.9%), and 100% (95% CI 98.2%-100%), respectively, with a Cohen's kappa of 0.81 (95% CI 0.78-0.84). Excluding specimens with lower (Elecsys) antibody titers, the agreement improved with overall, positive, and negative percent concordance of 94.4% (95% CI 92.3%-96.1%), 91.8% (95% CI 88.8%-94.3%), and 100% (95% CI 98.2%-100%), respectively, and a Cohen's kappa of 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.90).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the adequacy of currently established NT-proBNP reference limits for clinical use in healthy Salukis. Cardiac health of 33 clinically healthy Salukis was evaluated via echocardiography using available breed standards. Plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP were measured using a commercially available assay. A one-sided 97.5% upper reference limit for the NT-proBNP concentrations was calculated using non-parametric percentile method. The 97.5% upper reference limit was 769 pmol/L (90% CI, 547-1214 pmol/L) for the study dogs. This upper reference limit was within the currently established non-breed specific NT-proBNP upper reference limit of 900 pmol/L. No relationship between sex, age, or body weight on plasma levels of NT-proBNP was noted. Results of this study supports the use of currently available non-breed specific NT-proBNP cut-off values for clinical evaluation of healthy Salukis."
https://openalex.org/W4226047931,"Background In France, the number of emergency department (ED) admissions doubled between 1996 and 2016. To cope with the resulting crowding situation, redirecting patients to new healthcare services was considered a viable solution which would spread demand more evenly across available healthcare delivery points and render care more efficient. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of opening new on-demand care services based on variations in patient flow at a large hospital emergency department. Methods We performed a before-and-after study investigating the use of unscheduled care services in the Aube region in eastern France, that focused on ED attendance at Troyes Hospital. A hierarchical clustering based on co-occurrence of diagnoses was applied which divided the population into different multimorbidity profiles. Temporal trends of the resultant clusters were also studied empirically and using regression models. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to adjust the periodic effect for appropriate confounders and therefore confirm its presence. Results In total, 120,722 visits to the ED were recorded over a 24-month period (2018–2019) and 16 clusters were identified, accounting for 94.76% of all visits. There was a decrease of 56.77 visits per week in seven specific clusters and an increase of use of unscheduled health care services by 328.12 visits per week. Conclusions Using an innovative and reliable methodology to evaluate changes in patient flow through the ED, these findings may help inform public health policy experts on the implementation of unscheduled care services to ease pressure on hospital EDs."
https://openalex.org/W4210289030,"Ion channels use charged amino-acid residues to attract oppositely charged permeant ions into the channel pore. In the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel, a number of arginine and lysine residues have been shown to be important for Cl- permeation. Among these, two in close proximity in the pore-Lys95 and Arg134-are indispensable for anion binding and high Cl- conductance, suggesting that high positive charge density is required for pore function. Here we used mutagenesis and functional characterization to show that a nearby pore-lining negatively charged residue (Glu92) plays a functionally additive role with these two positive charges. While neutralization of this negative charge had little effect on anion binding or Cl- conductance, such neutralization was able to reverse the detrimental effects of removing the positive charge at either Lys95 or Arg134, as well as the similar effects of introducing a negative charge at a neighboring residue (Ser1141). Furthermore, neutralization of Glu92 greatly increased the susceptibility of the channel to blockage by divalent S2O32- anions, mimicking the effect of introducing additional positive charge in this region; this effect was reversed by concurrent neutralization of either Lys95 or Arg134. Across a panel of mutant channels that introduced or removed fixed charges at these four positions, we found that many pore properties are dependent on the overall charge or charge density. We propose that the CFTR pore uses a combination of positively and negatively charged residues to optimize the anion binding and Cl- conductance properties of the channel."

Among participants, 77 (35.1%), 119(54.3%), and 23(10.5%) students indicated that they wished to stay in Australia only until completion of their studies, temporarily and permanently, respectively.Our findings showed that Saudi students in Australia had strong psychosocial well-being, cultural integration, and academic success. Most of them were satisfied and adjusted well to Australian culture."

They can improve the total-factor productivity (TFP) and help transform and upgrade industrial structures. This study uses data for private listed manufacturing companies from 2009 to 2017 to examine the effects of different types of subsidies on TFP. We also analyze the heterogeneity and specific mechanism of subsidy effects. We find that R&D subsidies and production subsidies positively affect private enterprises' TFP. Moreover, R&D subsidies and production subsidies lagged by one period can also significantly increase private enterprises' TFP. In terms of industry, R&D subsidies have more obvious effects on technology-intensive industries, while production subsidies have more significant effects on labor-intensive and capital-intensive industries. In terms of scale, R&D subsidies' effects on the TFP of medium-sized enterprises are the largest, while production subsidies have the greatest effect on small enterprises' TFP. Government subsidies increase private enterprises' TFP through two mechanisms: improving technological innovation capability and alleviating financing constraints. Our results suggest that governments should formulate different subsidy policies according to industry and enterprise scale."
https://openalex.org/W4210555496,"Soil spatial heterogeneity involves nutrients being patchily distributed at a range of scales and is prevalent in natural habitats. However, little is known about the effect of soil spatial configurations at the small scale on plant foraging behavior and plant growth under different resource amounts. Here, we experimentally investigated how a stoloniferous species, Trifolium repens , responded to varied resource amounts and spatial configuration combinations. Plant foraging behavior (i.e., the orientation of the primary stolon, mean length of the primary stolon, foraging precision, and foraging scale) and plant growth (i.e., total biomass, root biomass, shoot biomass, and root/shoot) were compared among differently designed configurations of soil resources in different amounts. The relationships of foraging behavior and plant biomass were analyzed. The results showed that the effect of the spatial configuration of soil resources on Trifolium repens depended on the resource amount. Specifically, when the total resource amount was low, fragmented soil patches promoted root foraging and increased Trifolium repens plant biomass; however, when the total resource amount was high, the soil spatial configuration did not affect foraging behavior or plant growth. Our results also showed that plant growth was facilitated by root foraging scale to adapt to low resource amounts. We conclude that the spatial configuration of soil resources at small scales affects whole plant growth, which is mediated by a distinct foraging strategy. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how the growth strategy of clonal plants responds to heterogeneous environments caused by different resource amounts and its spatial configurations."
https://openalex.org/W4210610231,"This study investigated differences in external training load between microcycle lengths and its variation between microcycles, players, and head coaches. Commonly used external training load variables including total-, high-speed- (5-7 m∙s-1), and sprint-distance (> 7 m∙s-1) alongside combined high acceleration and deceleration distance (> 2 m∙s-2). Which were also expressed relative to time were collected using microtechnology within a repeated measures design from 54 male rugby league players from one Super League team over four seasons. 4337 individual observations across ninety-one separate microcycles and six individual microcycle lengths (5 to 10 day) were included. Linear mixed effects models established the differences in training load between microcycle-length and the variation between-microcycles, players and head coaches. The largest magnitude of difference in training load was seen when comparing 5-day with 9-day (ES = 0.31 to 0.53) and 10-day (ES = 0.19 to 0.66) microcycles. The greatest number of differences between microcycles were observed in high- (ES = 0.3 to 0.53) and sprint-speed (ES = 0.2 to 0.42) variables. Between-microcycle variability ranged between 11% to 35% dependent on training load variable. Training load also varied between players (5-65%) and head coaches (6-20%) with most variability existing within high-speed (19-43%) and sprinting (19-65%). Overall, differences in training load between microcycle lengths exist, likely due to manipulation of session duration. Furthermore, training load varies between microcycle, player and head coach."
https://openalex.org/W4210619107,"As a common medium-throughput technique, qPCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) is widely used to measure levels of nucleic acids. In addition to accurate and complete data, experimenters have unavoidably observed some incomplete and uncertainly determined qPCR data because of intrinsically low overall amounts of biological materials, such as nucleic acids present in biofluids. When there are samples with uncertainly determined qPCR data, some investigators apply the statistical complete-case method by excluding the subset of samples with uncertainly determined data from analysis (CO), while others simply choose not to analyze (CNA) these datasets altogether. To include as many observations as possible in analysis for interesting differential changes between groups, some investigators set incomplete observations equal to the maximum quality qPCR cycle (MC), such as 32 and 40. Although straightforward, these methods may decrease the sample size, skew the data distribution, and compromise statistical power and research reproducibility across replicate qPCR studies. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing, commonly-used qPCR data analysis methods and to join the efforts in advancing statistical analysis in rigorous preclinical research, we propose a robust nonparametric statistical cycle-to-threshold method (CTOT) to analyze incomplete qPCR data for two-group comparisons. CTOT incorporates important characteristics of qPCR data and time-to-event statistical methodology, resulting in a novel analytical method for qPCR data that is built around good quality data from all subjects, certainly determined or not. Considering the benchmark full data (BFD), we compared the abilities of CTOT, CO, MC, and CNA statistical methods to detect interesting differential changes between groups with informative but uncertainly determined qPCR data. Our simulations and applications show that CTOT improves the power of detecting and confirming differential changes in many situations over the three commonly used methods without excess type I errors. The robust nonparametric statistical method of CTOT helps leverage qPCR technology and increase the power to detect differential changes that may assist decision making with respect to biomarker detection and early diagnosis, with the goal of improving the management of patient healthcare."
