https://openalex.org/W3103071483,"Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks."

We have determined the crystal structure of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui at 2.4 angstrom resolution, and it includes 2833 of the subunit's 3045 nucleotides and 27 of its 31 proteins. The domains of its RNAs all have irregular shapes and fit together in the ribosome like the pieces of a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle to form a large, monolithic structure. Proteins are abundant everywhere on its surface except in the active site where peptide bond formation occurs and where it contacts the small subunit. Most of the proteins stabilize the structure by interacting with several RNA domains, often using idiosyncratically folded extensions that reach into the subunit's interior."
https://openalex.org/W2097654784,"Using the atomic structures of the large ribosomal subunit from Haloarcula marismortui and its complexes with two substrate analogs, we establish that the ribosome is a ribozyme and address the catalytic properties of its all-RNA active site. Both substrate analogs are contacted exclusively by conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) residues from domain V of 23S rRNA; there are no protein side-chain atoms closer than about 18 angstroms to the peptide bond being synthesized. The mechanism of peptide bond synthesis appears to resemble the reverse of the acylation step in serine proteases, with the base of A2486 (A2451 in Escherichia coli) playing the same general base role as histidine-57 in chymotrypsin. The unusual pK(a) (where K(a) is the acid dissociation constant) required for A2486 to perform this function may derive in part from its hydrogen bonding to G2482 (G2447 in E. coli), which also interacts with a buried phosphate that could stabilize unusual tautomers of these two bases. The polypeptide exit tunnel is largely formed by RNA but has significant contributions from proteins L4, L22, and L39e, and its exit is encircled by proteins L19, L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e."
https://openalex.org/W2043129312,"Wnts are secreted signaling proteins that regulate developmental processes. Here we show that Wnt signaling, likely mediated by Wnt-10b, is a molecular switch that governs adipogenesis. Wnt signaling maintains preadipocytes in an undifferentiated state through inhibition of the adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). When Wnt signaling in preadipocytes is prevented by overexpression of Axin or dominant-negative TCF4, these cells differentiate into adipocytes. Disruption of Wnt signaling also causes transdifferentiation of myoblasts into adipocytes in vitro, highlighting the importance of this pathway not only in adipocyte differentiation but also in mesodermal cell fate determination."

For a vortex (a ferromagnetic dot with a curling magnetic structure), a spot of perpendicular magnetization has been theoretically predicted to exist at the center of the vortex. Experimental evidence for this magnetization spot is provided by magnetic force microscopy imaging of circular dots of permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20 ) 0.3 to 1 micrometer in diameter and 50 nanometers thick."

https://openalex.org/W2005096312,"Previous work has identified two families of proteins that transport classical neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles, but the protein responsible for vesicular transport of the principal excitatory transmitter glutamate has remained unknown. We demonstrate that a protein that is unrelated to any known neurotransmitter transporters and that was previously suggested to mediate the Na(+)-dependent uptake of inorganic phosphate across the plasma membrane transports glutamate into synaptic vesicles. In addition, we show that this vesicular glutamate transporter, VGLUT1, exhibits a conductance for chloride that is blocked by glutamate."

https://openalex.org/W2094930349,"Synaptic efficacy critically depends on the presynaptic intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). We measured the calcium sensitivity of glutamate release in a rat auditory brainstem synapse by laser photolysis of caged calcium. A rise in [Ca2+]i to 1 micromolar readily evoked release. An increase to >30 micromolar depleted the releasable vesicle pool in <0.5 millisecond. A comparison with action potential-evoked release suggested that a brief increase of [Ca2+]i to approximately 10 micromolar would be sufficient to reproduce the physiological release pattern. Thus, the calcium sensitivity of release at this synapse is high, and the distinction between phasic and delayed release is less pronounced than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2009141757,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/Rel transcription factors are key regulators of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and development. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB/Rel proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB inhibitor proteins. Many extracellular stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), cause rapid phosphorylation of IκB at N-terminal serine residues leading to ubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor. Subsequently, NF-κB proteins translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression through κB response elements. TNFα, as well as certain other stimuli, also induces the phosphorylation of the NF-κB proteins. Previously, we have shown that TNFα induces RelA/p65 phosphorylation at serine 529 and that this inducible phosphorylation increases NF-κB transcriptional activity on an exogenously supplied reporter (1Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that casein kinase II (CKII) interacts with p65 in vivo and can phosphorylate p65 at serine 529 in vitro. A CKII inhibitor (PD144795) inhibited TNFα-induced p65 phosphorylation in vivo. Furthermore, our results indicate that the association between IκBα and p65 inhibits p65 phosphorylation by CKII and that degradation of IκBα allows CKII to phosphorylate p65 to increase NF-κB transactivation potential. These data may explain the ability of CKII to modulate cell growth and demonstrate a mechanism whereby CKII can function in an inducible manner.

NF-κB was first identified as a constitutively active transcription factor that binds to the immunoglobulin κ light chain enhancer in mature B cells (4Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). There are five members of the mammalian Rel family of proteins that have been cloned and characterized: RelA/p65, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p50/p105), NF-κB2 (p52/p100), and RelB (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 5Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). Each of these proteins is characterized by a Rel homology domain (RHD), which is involved in dimerization, DNA binding, interactions with IκB, and nuclear localization. Several, but not all, of the NF-κB proteins contain transcriptional activation domains, which promote interactions with basal transcription components or with transcriptional co-activators. For example, RelA/p65 contains at least two transactivation domains in the C-terminal region and an element in the RHD involved with recruitment of co-activators (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 6Zhong H.

In most unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins that mask the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB (7Ganchi P.A. Sun S.C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In response to various stimuli, the IκB kinase (IKK) signaling cascade is activated, leading to the phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine residues Ser32 and Ser36 of IκBα (11Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 12Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M.

Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation promotes ubiquitination of the IκB proteins, which are subsequently targeted for rapid degradation via the 26 S proteasome (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 16Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The degradation of IκB then promotes nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In the nucleus, NF-κB is a positive regulator of genes involved in immune and inflammatory processes and cell proliferation. Regarding the latter point, NF-κB is now known to regulate transcription of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, to be activated by a variety of oncoproteins, and to be required for oncogenesis or tumorigenesis in different settings (17Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Rev. Cancer Online. 2000; 1470: M55-M62Google Scholar). Interestingly, nuclear translocation and DNA binding are apparently not sufficient to activate an NF-κB-dependent reporter. For example, it has been shown that inhibition of tyrosine kinase signaling inhibits the ability of interleukin-1 to activate an NF-κB-dependent reporter but does not block nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB (18Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y.Q. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18306-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by the use of a small molecule inhibitor blocks reporter activity but does not affect nuclear translocation of NF-κB (19Vanden Berghe W.

Consistent with these observations, it has been found that signals that activate NF-κB can also cause the phosphorylation of NF-κB molecules (6Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

In vitro studies suggest that phosphorylation of p50 or p65 enhances NF-κB DNA binding ability (21Naumann M. Scheidereit C.

Work by Zhong et al. (6Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) demonstrated that LPS induces PKA-dependent phosphorylation of p65, increasing NF-κB transcriptional potential in B and T cells. This phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300 (28Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). In this case, the catalytic subunit of PKA is found associated with NF-κB, and PKA can phosphorylate p65 following IκB degradation. Another group has provided evidence that IKK can phosphorylate RelA/p65 on serine 536 (29Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that TNFα treatment of fibroblasts and HeLa cells leads to phosphorylation of p65 on serine 529, which leads to increased transcriptional potential (1Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence surrounding serine 529 fits the consensus site for casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation. CKII is a serine/threonine kinase, which is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human (30Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In most organisms, CKII is a tetramer composed of two α (and/or α′) and two β subunits (31Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Disruption of both genes encoding α and α′ subunits of CKII in yeast results in a complete loss of cell viability (33Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), indicating that CKII is essential. The consensus sequence for CKII phosphorylation is serine (or threonine)-X-X-acidic, where the acidic amino acid could be glutamic acid, aspartic acid, phosphoserine, or phosphotyrosine (30Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To date, more than 100 proteins have been found to be substrates of CKII, including several transcription factors. Phosphorylation of transcription factors by CKII can affect their nuclear transport, DNA binding, or transactivation abilities (30Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of c-Jun by CKII negatively affects AP-1 DNA binding ability (34Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), while PU.1 phosphorylation by CKII enables its interaction with another transcription factor, NF-EM5, to activate transcription (35Pongubala J.M. Van Beveren C. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that overexpression of CKII enhances cell proliferation (36Vilk G. Saulnier R.B. St Pierre R. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14406-14414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and tumor formation in a p53 null setting (37Landesman-Bollag E. Channavajhala P.L. Cardiff R.D. Seldin D.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2965-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), providing compelling evidence for a role for CKII in oncogenesis and cell growth. CKII has been proposed to regulate NF-κB activity through modulation of IκB. Thus, several laboratories have reported that CKII constitutively phosphorylates the C-terminal PEST region of IκBα (38Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 39Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that this phosphorylation is required for the basal turnover of the IκBα protein (39Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, others found that the C-terminal region of IκBα is dispensable for its degradation (42Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CKII also causes inducible phosphorylation of IκBα, since it was found that CKII phosphorylates serine 32 of IκBα in response to TNFα or okadaic acid treatment of HeLa cells. Relevant to phosphorylation of RelA/p65, Bird et al. (44Bird T.A. Schooley K. Dower S.K. Hagen H. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32606-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) have reported that a kinase with properties consistent with CKII activity associates with RelA/p65 in fibroblasts and hepatoma cells and that purified CKII can phosphorylate p65 in vitro. In this study, we report that CKII phosphorylates p65 at serine 529 following TNFα stimulation, although overall CKII activity is only weakly increased in HeLa cells. We provide evidence that, in unstimulated cells, the association of IκBα with NF-κB inhibits CKII phosphorylation of p65. Signal-induced degradation of IκBα releases this inhibition and enables CKII to phosphorylate p65 on serine 529. These results provide a rationale to explain the involvement of CKII with oncogenesis and cell proliferation and offer a mechanism to explain inducible CKII activity. HeLa cells and the stable cells that either express F-p65 or F-529A (1Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cell lysates were made in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Flag M2-conjugated beads or CKII antibody (Upstate Technologies) in protein A beads. The precipitated proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) for Western blot analysis. For the kinase assays, the precipitated proteins were boiled in the presence of 1% SDS and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) for 5 min and subjected to another round of immunoprecipitation before use in the kinase assay. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (45Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

For each transfection, 5 μg of 3XκBluc plasmid was incubated with 30 μl of SuperFect. Six hours before harvest, TNFα (10 ng/ml) was added to the cells that have been pretreated with PD144795 (gift of Dr. S. Hunt, Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals, Ann Arbor, MI) or Me2SO for 1 h. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (47Cogswell P.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRSET-p65 was made by cloning the polymerase chain reaction product into the BamHI site of pRSET B (Invitrogen). The template for the polymerase chain reaction is pCMV-p65. The primers are 5′-CCG GGA TCC GAC GAA CTG TTC CCC CTC ATC-3′ and 5′-GGC GGA TCC TTA GGA GCT GAT CTG ACT C-3′. His-tagged p65 was purified using His-Bind purification kits (Novagen). For 32P metabolic labeling, cells were grown in phosphate-free medium with 2% serum for 3 h. PD144795 and [32P]H3PO4 were added 1 h before harvest.

For CKII assay, immunoprecipitated p65 or bacterially expressed His tagged p65 was incubated with CKII (Promega) at 37 °C for 10 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 m NaCl, 10 μm MgCl, 100 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. For PKA assay, the proteins were incubated with PKA catalytic subunit (Promega) at 30 °C for 5 min in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated p65 were resolved in SDS-PAGE. After exposure to x-ray film, the gels were dried and analyzed by Western blot or by GELCODE blue stain reagent (Pierce). To assay for CKII activity, HeLa cells were either left untreated or treated with TNFα for various times. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). After repeated freeze-thaw, whole cell lysates were collected by centrifuging. Whole cell lysates (50 μg) were used to assay for casein kinase II activity by using a casein kinase-2 assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). TNFα stimulation of HeLa cells or fibroblasts induces phosphorylation of p65 on serine 529 (1Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Close examination of the sequence downstream of serine 529 (SGDE) revealed that it is a consensus CKII site (31Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence matches the S-X-X-acidic consensus motif for CKII phosphorylation. It was therefore possible that CKII phosphorylates p65 in response to TNFα induction. To test this possibility, we first determined if CKII interacts with p65in vivo. Flag-tagged p65 was immunoprecipitated from immortalized p65 knockout fibroblasts that have been restored with flag-tagged p65 (F-p65 cells described in Ref. 1Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and the precipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-CKII antibody. The results of these experiments showed that the flag M2 antibody pulled down two peptides recognized by the anti-CKII antibody (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). These two peptides represented the CKII catalytic subunits α and α′, as the anti-CKII antibody was specifically made against these two subunits. As a positive control, the anti-CKII antibody precipitated the same molecular weight peptides (Fig.1 A, lane 2). The reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, in which the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-CKII antibody and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by an anti-p65 antibody, showed that the anti-CKII antibody co-immunoprecipitated p65 (Fig. 1 A,lane 4). The data shown in Fig. 1 A support and extend the previous observation by Bird et al. (44Bird T.A. Schooley K. Dower S.K. Hagen H. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32606-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), who showed that immunoprecipitated NF-κB complexes contained kinase activity that was indistinguishable from CKII, although direct blotting for CKII was not accomplished. Encouraged by this result, we then wanted to determine whether TNFα stimulation of cells affected the interaction between CKII and p65. To accomplish this, F-p65 cells were either left untreated or were treated with TNFα for various times. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with flag M2 antibody, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-CKII antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the p65-associated CKII level decreased upon TNFα induction (lanes 1–4). Interestingly, the interaction between CKII and a mutant p65 (529A) that cannot be phosphorylated following TNFα stimulation remained constant (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5–8), suggesting that serine 529 of p65 may be a target for CKII and that phosphorylation of p65 may cause the release of CKII. To determine whether CKII phosphorylates p65 at serine 529, both flag-tagged wild-type p65 and p65 529A were immunoprecipitated from the lysates of untreated cells and used for in vitro kinase assays with purified CKII. As shown in Fig. 2 A, CKII phosphorylated wild-type p65 (lanes 2 and3, upper panel), but not 529A (lanes 5 and 6, upper panel). Western blot analysis indicated that the loss of phosphorylation of 529A by CKII is not due to lower substrate protein levels (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Endogenous p65 from HeLa cells can also be phosphorylated by CKII (Fig.2 A, lane 8). Importantly, another serine/threonine kinase, PKA, which has been reported to phosphorylate p65 (6Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), phosphorylated the mutant protein as efficiently as the wild-type p65 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 10 and12). In addition, bacterially expressed His-tagged wild-type p65 but not 529A was phosphorylated by CKII, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by the CKII-specific inhibitor PD144795 (see below) (Fig.2 B, left panel), whereas PD144795 had no effect on PKA phosphorylation of p65 (Fig. 2 B,right panel). These results demonstrated that CKII phosphorylates p65 in vitro and that phosphorylation occurs at serine 529. We then wanted to determine if CKII phosphorylates p65 in vivo. To date, there are no reports in which CKII function can be inhibited in vivo by genetic approaches. The difficulties could result from the possibility that CKII α and α′ compensate for each other, with disruption of either one not affecting overall CKII activity, while knockout of both leads to loss of viability, as in yeast cells (33Padmanabha R. Chen-Wu J.L. Hanna D.E. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 48Chen-Wu J. Padmanabha R. Glover C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4981-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose a pharmacological approach to determine if we could block TNFα-induced p65 phosphorylation. PD144795 is a benzothiophene, which was originally found to inhibit HIV expression (50Critchfield J.W. Butera S.T. Folks T.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The selective target for inhibition was later found to be CKII, as this compound interacts with the kinase at the nucleotide binding site (51Critchfield J.W. Coligan J.E. Folks T.M. Butera S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6110-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (50Critchfield J.W. Butera S.T. Folks T.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1996; 12: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we found that PD144795 did not affect TNFα-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 A). However, PD144795 inhibited κB-dependent transcription (Fig.3 B). Moreover, pretreatment of HeLa cells with PD144795 decreased TNFα-induced p65 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). These results suggested that CKII phosphorylates p65 in response to TNFα induction in HeLa cells. Our original study utilized phosphopeptide mapping to identify serine 529 as the major site of TNF-induced phosphorylation (1Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Recently, another group has reported that IKK can phosphorylate p65 both in vivo and in vitro on serine 536 (29Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that serine 529 is phosphorylated in response to TNFα stimulation, we generated an antibody to a peptide with phosphoserine at position 529. Immunoblotting with this antibody confirms recognition of phosphoserine 529 following TNFα stimulation of HeLa cells (Fig.4). Thus, it is clear that serine 529 is a major site of phosphorylation following TNFα treatment of HeLa cells or fibroblasts (see “Discussion”). We then utilized this antibody to determine if inducible phosphorylation of RelA/p65 on serine 529 requires release from IκBα. Potentially such a result could explain how CKII could be associated with p65 but not phosphorylate this substrate. In order to test this hypothesis, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and then stimulated the cells with TNFα. Control cells were exposed to the diluent for MG132 but still received TNFα. As shown in Fig. 4, TNFα induced phosphorylation on Ser529, with phosphorylation peaking at 10 min after stimulation. MG132 inhibited the induced phosphorylation, suggesting that IκB degradation is required for inducible phosphorylation. Additionally and consistent with this hypothesis, expression of the super-repressor (non-degradable) form of IκBα significantly blocked the TNFα-induced phosphorylation of p65 (data not shown). Regulation of CKII activity has been difficult to explain. There have been reports that CKII activity is constitutive and is not subjected to regulation (31Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar, 32Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 52Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). However, other studies indicated that stimulation of CKII activity can occur in response to growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (53Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15872-15875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (54Ackerman P. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11958-11965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was important for us to determine if TNFα-induced p65 phosphorylation correlated with increased CKII activity. HeLa cells were treated with TNFα for various times, and cells were lysed by repeated freeze-thaw to avoid detergent that may interfere with the kinase assay. Whole cell lysates were then subjected to Western analysis with anti-CKII antibody (Fig.5 A), and CKII activity was measured using a synthetic CKII substrate (Fig. 5 B). Unlike a recent report (43Heilker R. Freuler F. Pulfer R. Di Padova F. Eder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we were not able to detect a significant increase in CKII activity in response to TNFα induction. Instead, the CKII protein level was unchanged and kinase activity was only slightly induced following TNFα stimulation. In order to explain the inducible activation of CKII activity relevant to NF-κB phosphorylation and to explain the result showing that inhibition of IκB degradation inhibited inducible activity, we hypothesized that the association of CKII with the NF-κB complex leads to inhibition of kinase activity if IκB is present. To test our hypothesis, glutathione S-transferase-IκBα was added to the in vitro CKII kinase reaction. As shown in Fig.5 C, the addition of IκBα efficiently inhibited p65 phosphorylation by CKII. Therefore, these data indicate that when CKII is present in the NF-κB/IκB complex, it cannot phosphorylate p65. Induction of IκBα degradation would, therefore, lead to derepression of CKII activity, allowing it to phosphorylate p65. The current understanding of the regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB indicates that NF-κB is activated by two mechanisms that appear to be interrelated. One mechanism involves the induction of NF-κB to move into the nucleus following exposure of cells to a variety of stimuli. This mechanism is controlled by the activation of IKK activity, which subsequently phosphorylates IκB proteins on N-terminal serine residues leading to their ubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of IκB (3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). A less well understood regulation of NF-κB involves induced phosphorylation of RelA/p65 in response to a variety of stimuli. Interestingly, it is speculated that phosphorylation may be required for transcriptional function of NF-κB. Thus, Zhong et al. (6Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 28Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) showed convincingly that LPS induces phosphorylation of RelA/p65 on Ser276 in B and T cells and that this phosphorylation enhances the interaction with the transcriptional co-activators CBP and p300. The phosphorylation of Ser276 is controlled by the catalytic subunit of PKA associated with the NF-κB complex. Similar to the model proposed here for phosphorylation of p65 by CKII, it is proposed that degradation of IκB allows the PKA catalytic subunit to phosphorylate RelA/p65 on Ser276. Sizemore et al. (26Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation of p65 induced by interleukin-1 requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt and that this response activates the transcription function of NF-κB. Another group has presented data indicating that IKK itself may be involved directly in inducible phosphorylation of p65, showing that IKK can phosphorylate serine 536in vitro and when overexpressed in cells (29Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). However, there are no data demonstrating that this phosphorylation event contributed to transcriptional potential. Previously, we have shown that phosphorylation of serine 529 contributes to the ability of p65 to activate a κB-dependent reporter. Others have provided evidence that phosphorylation of NF-κB may enhance DNA binding, although in our previous studies we did not see an effect of mutation of serine 529 on DNA binding affinity (1Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We have shown in this report that the serine/threonine kinase CKII interacts with p65 in vivo, and purified CKII phosphorylates p65 at serine 529 in vitro. A CKII inhibitor reduced TNFα-induced p65 phosphorylation, suggesting that CKII phosphorylates p65 in response to TNFα stimulation in vivo. The results presented in this paper also suggest an interesting mechanism by which the activity of CKII is regulated. Our data indicate that CKII is associated with the NF-κB/IκB complex but is unable to phosphorylate p65 unless IκBα is degraded. It is presently unknown whether CKII directly interacts with p65 or with IκB or possibly both. CKII is a ubiquitous and highly conserved serine/threonine kinase which phosphorylates a number of nuclear proteins implicated in cell proliferation, such as c-Fos, c-Jun, Myc, Max, Myb, p53, adenovirus E1A protein, human papilloma virus E7 protein, and SV40 large T antigen (30Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The effect of CKII phosphorylation varies depending on the protein. For example, CKII phosphorylates the transcriptional regulatory factor Max to inhibit the DNA binding activity of Max/Max homodimers (55Berberich S.J. Cole M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), while phosphorylation of PU.1 by CKII promotes the interaction with NF-EM5 (35Pongubala J.M. Van Beveren C. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We have shown that p65 is also a substrate for CKII and phosphorylation of p65 by CKII increases NF-κB transcriptional potential. RelA/p65 has been shown to be phosphorylated in response to interleukin-1 and LPS induction (20Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H. Valentine M.A. Dower S.K. Meier K.E. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12722-12733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the putative p65 kinase that associates with both NF-κB and IκB has a molecular size that is very similar to the CKII α subunit (27Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26790-26795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Bird et al. (44Bird T.A. Schooley K. Dower S.K. Hagen H. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32606-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a kinase with properties indistinguishable from CKII associates with p65 and phosphorylates itin vitro. As described above, it has been published recently that LPS-induced p65 phosphorylation by PKA at serine 276 enhances its interaction with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 (6Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 28Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Why different signals target different phosphorylation sites on p65 is presently unknown, but may be explained by differences in cell types or differences in signal transduction pathways. It has been shown before that CKII phosphorylates IκBα at its C-terminal PEST region on several serine and threonine residues and the function of this modification is unknown, although some researchers suggested that the phosphorylation of the PEST region by CKII is required for the basal turnover of the free IκBα proteins (38Barroga C.F.

CKII also phosphorylates the PEST domain of IκBβ (56Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is required for IκBβ to associate with c-Rel or other NF-κB subunits to inhibit NF-κB DNA binding. Recently, CKII was shown to be present in the kinase activities that phosphorylated IκBα at serine 32 along with p90rsk1 and IKKα/β (43Heilker R. Freuler F. Pulfer R. Di Padova F. Eder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in the TNFα- or okadaic acid-stimulated HeLa cell extracts. In the in vitrokinase assay, CKII phosphorylates serine 32 of the IκBα-derived peptide much more efficiently than serine 36 or any of the other IκBβ or IκBε-derived peptides. CKII may act alone or cooperate with another kinase to induce the N-terminal serine phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα in response to some stimuli. Therefore, CKII appears to regulate NF-κB at two levels: 1) by phosphorylating IκBα to induce its degradation, and 2) by phosphorylating p65 to increase NF-κB transcriptional activity. CKII has been shown to be necessary for cell cycle progression and for cell proliferation. CKII levels are elevated in rapidly proliferating non-neoplastic tissue and in solid tumors such as colorectal carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and bladder, kidney, gastric, and breast carcinomas (58Munstermann U. Fritz G. Seitz G. Lu Y.P. Schneider H.R. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, CKII cooperates with Tal-1 and c-Myc oncogenes to induce lymphoma (59Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 60Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). NF-κB also plays an important role in cell proliferation. Elevated levels of NF-κB have been correlated with cellular transformation (61Gilmore T.D. Koedood M. Piffat K.A. White D.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1367-1378PubMed Google Scholar, 62Sharma H.W. Narayanan R. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 589-596PubMed Google Scholar), and NF-κB has been shown to be required for transformation induced by oncogenic Ras and by the fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL (49Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 63Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if CKII cooperates with NF-κB to regulate cell transformation and tumorigenesis and if the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit by CKII is necessary for the cooperation."

https://openalex.org/W3105560627,"Granular materials and ordinary fluids react differently to shear stresses. Rather than deforming uniformly, materials such as dry sand or cohesionless powders develop shear bands--narrow zones of large relative particle motion, with essentially rigid adjacent regions. Because shear bands mark areas of flow, material failure and energy dissipation, they are important in many industrial, civil engineering and geophysical processes. They are also relevant to lubricating fluids confined to ultrathin molecular layers. However, detailed three-dimensional information on motion within a shear band, including the degree of particle rotation and interparticle slip, is lacking. Similarly, very little is known about how the microstructure of individual grains affects movement in densely packed material. Here we combine magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray tomography and high-speed-video particle tracking to obtain the local steady-state particle velocity, rotation and packing density for shear flow in a three-dimensional Couette geometry. We find that key characteristics of the granular microstructure determine the shape of the velocity profile."
https://openalex.org/W2125198243,"Molecular dynamics occurring in the earliest stages following photo-induced charge transfer were investigated. Femtosecond time-resolved absorption anisotropy measurements on [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ , where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine, reveal a time dependence in nitrile solutions attributed to initial delocalization of the excited state over all three ligands followed by charge localization onto a single ligand. The localization process is proposed to be coupled to nondiffusive solvation dynamics. In contrast, measurements sampling population dynamics show spectral evolution associated with wave packet motion on the excited state surface that is independent of solvent. The results therefore reveal two important contributions to the evolution of charge transfer states in condensed phase, one that is strongly coupled to the surrounding environment and another that follows a potential internal to the molecule."

A single universally conserved A (number 2451) within the central loop of domain V has a near neutral p K a of 7.6 ± 0.2, which is about the same as that reported for the peptidyl transferase reaction.

These results are consistent with a mechanism wherein the nucleotide base of A2451 serves as a general acid base during peptide bond formation."

The enzyme was found to be a homodimer that, in the presence of NAD+, but not of NADP, could catalyze the stereospecific oxidation of (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol (K m= 14 mm, k cat = 78,000 min−1) and meso-butanediol (K m = 65 mm,k cat = 46,000 min−1) to (3R)-acetoin and (3S)-acetoin, respectively. It was unable, however, to further oxidize these acetoins to diacetyl. In the presence of NADH, it could catalyze the stereospecific reduction of racemic acetoin ((3R/3S)- acetoin; K m = 4.5 mm, k cat = 98,000 min−1) to (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol andmeso-butanediol, respectively. The substrate stereospecificity was determined by analysis of products by gas-liquid chromatography. The YAL060W gene product can therefore be classified as an NAD-dependent (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH).S. cerevisiae could grow on 2,3-butanediol as the sole carbon and energy source. Under these conditions, a 3.5-fold increase in (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase activity was observed in the total cell extracts. The isoelectric focusing pattern of the induced enzyme coincided with that of the pure BDH (pI 6.9). The disruption of the YAL060W gene was not lethal for the yeast under laboratory conditions. The disrupted strain could also grow on 2,3-butanediol, although attaining a lesser cell density than the wild-type strain. Taking into consideration the substrate specificity of the YAL060W gene product, we propose the name of BDH for this gene. The corresponding enzyme is the first eukaryotic (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase characterized of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The completion of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae genome project in 1996 showed that almost 60% of the potential open reading frames of the genome had no experimentally determined function.

When theSaccharomyces cerevisiae genome project was finished, it was found that ∼60% of the potential open reading frames of the genome had no defined function (1Botstein D. Chervitz S.A. Cherry J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1259-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). One way of finding the biological role of each gene is to study its pattern of expression. A systematic effort has been performed in S. cerevisiae by means of DNA microarrays. The study of the temporal program of the gene expression accompanying the metabolic shift from fermentation to respiration has yield useful information on virtually every gene of this yeast (2DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). Another approach is to use consensus sequences of well characterized protein families to reveal close relatives, previously uncharacterized, in the sequenced genomes. The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)1 superfamily catalyzes the reversible oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones and can be grouped in at least three enzyme families: medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (MDR), short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR), and iron-activated alcohol dehydrogenases (3Jörnvall H. Danielsson O. Eklund H. Helmqvist L. Höög J.-O. Parés X. Shafqat J. Weiner H. Crabb D.W. Flynn T.G. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. 4.

Since most of the enzymes belonging to the MDR family contain one or two Zn2+ ions/subunit, they are also known as Zn2+-containing medium-chain ADHs. S. cerevisiae has seven genes coding for MDR enzymes with known function: ADH1 codes for the fermentative enzyme responsible for ethanol production from acetaldehyde and NADH, and it is produced in large amounts in glucose-grown cells (5Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ADH2 encodes the glucose-repressible isozyme (ADHII) that converts the ethanol accumulated under anaerobic conditions to acetaldehyde and allows the yeast to grow with ethanol as the carbon source (6Ciriacy M.

Pilgrim D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3024-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and which is also repressed by glucose. ADH5 codes for an ADH with a 76% sequence identity to the ADHI isozyme (10Feldmann H. Aigle M. Aljinovic G. André B. Baclet M.C. Barthe C. Baur A. Becam A.M. Biteau N.

In this work, we have used a conserved sequence motif found in the Zn2+-containing medium-chain ADH (the zinc-containing ADH signature) (18Persson B. Hallborn J. Walfridsson M. Hahn-Hägerdal B.

One of the genes found with unknown function,YAL060W, was overexpressed in a yeast ADH-deficient strain, and the protein was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme was found to be a dimer that oxidized reversibly and stereospecifically (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol andmeso-2,3-butanediol to (3R)-acetoin and (3S)-acetoin, respectively. Although other (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenases have been described, this would be, to our knowledge, the first characterized eukaryotic protein with this specificity and known sequence belonging to the family of zinc-containing medium-chain ADHs. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Vent polymerase was from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). DNA oligomers were synthesized and purified by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Chemicals were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), Aldrich, or Sigma and were of the highest quality available.

This sequence contains a histidine that is the second ligand of the catalytic zinc and several glycines that are important for structural reasons in the substrate-binding domain of these enzymes (21Sun H. Plapp B.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW Version 1.7 software (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibbson J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) in combination with TreeView Version 1.6.1 (23Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar) to study phylogenies. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for cloning procedures. The yeast ADH-deficient strain WV36-405 (MAT a, ade2,ura3-52, trp1, adh1Δ,adh2Δ, adh3, adh4::TRP1) (24Atrian S. González-Duarte R. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), constructed by Dr. Wolfgang Vogel (Institut fur Strahlenbiologie, Neuherberger, Germany) and generously provided by Dr. Silvia Atrian (Universitat de Barcelona), was used to search for the function of theYAL060W gene product. Because of its low background in alcohol oxidation reactions, this strain is useful in ascertaining potentially new ADH genes. The yeast strain FY834α (MATα, his3Δ200, ura3-52,leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202,trp1Δ63) (25Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), used in the S. cerevisiae genome project, was used here to amplify theYAL060W gene by PCR. The cell growth in the presence of 2,3-butanediol, and the levels of 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase activity in the homogenates were studied in both yeast strains (WV36-405 and FY834α). The protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5459 (MAT a, ura3-52,trp1, lys2-801,leu2Δ1, his3Δ200,pep4::HIS3,prb1Δ1.6R, can1, GAL) (26Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), generously provided by Dr. Benjamı́ Piña (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı́ficas, Barcelona, Spain), was used to overexpress and purify the YAL060W gene product. The inducible E. coli-yeast shuttle vector pYes2 (carrying the promoter and upstream activating sequences ofGAL1) from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) was used to clone and overexpress the YAL060W gene in yeast strains WV36-405 and BJ5459. E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin to select for the desired plasmid constructs. Yeast strains WV36-405 and BJ5459 were grown at 30 °C in synthetic complete medium lactriyourairl supplemented with 2% galactose to allow for the selection and induction of the yeast transformed with the pYes2 constructs. The medium used to grow the yeast in 2,3-butanediol contained 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% peptone, and 0.5 or 3% 2,3-butanediol isomers (mixture of (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol, (2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol, andmeso-2,3-butanediol). All DNA manipulations were performed under standard conditions as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast genomic DNA was isolated from yeast strain FY834α by standard methods (28Ausubel F.H. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols of Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing/Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 133.1-13.7.2Google Scholar), and theYAL060W gene was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide 5′-GGGGTACCAATTATGAGAGCTTTGGCATATTTC-3′, which hybridizes at the 5′-end of the gene and carries a KpnI restriction site, and the oligonucleotide 5′-GCGGAATTCTTACTTCATTTCACCGTGATTGTTAG-3′, which hybridizes at the 3′-end and carries an EcoRI restriction site. The amplification initiated with a “hot start,” which was followed by five cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, and 90 s of extension at 72 °C. This initial phase was followed by 25 more cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 90 s of extension at 72 °C at the end. The PCR mixture contained 1 unit of Vent DNA polymerase, 1 μmeach primer, 200 μm each dNTP, and 2 mmMgSO4. To construct theYAL060W expression vector under the control of theGAL1 promoter, the gel-purified PCR product obtained above was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and ligated to the pYes2 vector digested with the same restriction enzymes. Both chains of the plasmid construct, pYes2-YAL060W, were sequenced (Oswel Research Products, Southampton, UK) to verify that there were no mutations introduced by PCR and that the construct was correct. Yeast strains WV36-405 and BJ5459 were grown in rich medium and transformed with the pYes2 and pYes2-YAL060W vectors following the method of Ito et al. (29Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected on SC-Ura plates (28Ausubel F.H. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols of Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing/Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 133.1-13.7.2Google Scholar). The disruption of theYAL060W gene was carried out by one-step gene replacement (30Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) with the TRP1 gene. The starting point was plasmid pYes2-YAL060W, containing the coding region ofYAL060W that was digested with MluNI. This digestion removed ∼360 base pairs of the YAL060W coding region and was followed by the insertion of the TRP1 gene. The TRP1 gene, which was obtained by digesting the YDp-W vector (31Berben G. Dumant J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) with BamHI, was subcloned into theMluNI site mentioned above after making blunt ends. This construct was digested with KpnI and EcoRI, resulting in a linear fragment containing the TRP1 gene flanked by homologous regions of the YAL060W gene. This fragment was introduced into the yeast haploid strain FY834α by the lithium acetate method (29Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and after homologous recombination, the coding region of YAL060W was disrupted with theTRP1 gene. The yeast cells that had incorporated theTRP1 gene were selected by growing in Wikerham's medium supplemented for all auxotrophs except for tryptophan. The disruption of the YAL060W gene in several transformants was confirmed by PCR of the genomic DNA and by enzyme activity in the homogenates of the resulting yeast strains. Enzyme activities were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm and 25 °C corresponding to the oxidation of NADH (ε340 = 6220m−1 cm−1) or the reduction of NAD+. The purification of theYAL060W gene product was followed by measuring the activity with 120 mm (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol and 4 mm NAD+ in 33 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8). To determine the steady-state kinetic constants, the enzyme assays were carried out with the pH 8 buffer and 5 mm NAD+ for the oxidation reactions, and with 33 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7) 0.2 mm NADH for the reduction reactions. After adding 20–50 μl of enzyme solution, the reaction was started by the addition of the substrate. One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of NAD(H) formed/min. The initial velocities were measured in duplicate at eight different substrate concentrations, and the kinetic constants were calculated using the nonlinear regression program Enzfitter (Elsevier/Biosoft). All reported values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. (2R,3R)-2,3-Butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH) was purified from yeast strain BJ5459(pYes2-YAL060W), and all the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cells (34 g) were suspended in 34 ml of buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 30% glycerol and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) and broken up with glass beads 0.5 mm in diameter. The lysate was centrifuged at 29,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was applied to a hydroxylapatite Bio-Gel HT column (10.5 × 2 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with 250 ml of the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 20–600 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 30% glycerol and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in a 400-ml total volume. The active fractions were pooled; concentrated in an Amicon concentrator, which also served for changing the buffer to buffer A; and applied to a Cibacron Blue 3GA-agarose column (11.5 × 2.4 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with buffer (330 ml), a linear gradient of NADH (0–250 μm in 200 ml) was applied. After washing again with buffer A (185 ml), the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–2m NaCl in 700 ml of buffer. The active fractions were pooled and applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 0.15m NaCl, and 30% glycerol. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with the equilibration buffer. The purified enzyme was concentrated and stored at −80 °C. The relative mass of the native enzyme was determined by size exclusion chromatography at 22 °C on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. The column was connected to a high performance liquid chromatography apparatus (Waters) and was equilibrated with 2 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 0.15 m NaCl, and 30% glycerol. The column was run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The molecular mass was estimated by comparison with the elution of protein standards. The molecular mass was also determined by native gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in which proteins were visualized by silver staining. The submolecular structure of the enzyme was studied under denaturing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and silver staining. Isoelectric focusing was performed according to a reported method (33Robertson E.F. Dannelly H.K. Malloy P.J. Reeves H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The pI of the YAL060W gene product was determined by comparison with known standards (isoelectric focusing calibration kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The BDH activity was visualized by incubating the gel at pH 8.6 with 0.5 m(2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol, 0.6 mmNAD+, 5-methylphenazine methosulfate (0.1 mg/ml), and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (0.2 mg/ml). GLC analyses were performed in a Shimadzu GC-14B gas chromatograph equipped with a chiral column (Supelco β-DEXTM 120, 30-m length, 0.25-mm inner diameter), helium as the carrier gas (2.4 ml/min), and a flame ionization detector (275 °C). The following temperature program was used: isotherm at 75 °C for 8 min, 2 °C/min ramp to 85 °C, and isotherm at 85 °C. A standard mixture of 40 mm(3R/3S)-acetoin, 7.5 mm(2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol, 9.5 mm(2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol, and 7 mm meso-2,3-butanediol was prepared by dissolving the pure compounds in 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). One volume of the standard mixture was extracted with 1 volume of ethyl acetate, and 1 μl of the organic phase was applied to the chiral column. This extraction protocol was repeated three times, showing that the recovery of the compounds was >70% after the first extraction and that the relative percentages of the recovered compounds were similar for each extraction step. The reagents and products of the enzymatic reaction mixtures were extracted with ethyl acetate before the analysis by GLC. The search performed with the BLAST program found the following genes of unknown function that could be members of the NAD+-dependent, zinc-containing medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases: YDL246C, which codes for a protein nearly identical (>99% identity) to the product of theSOR1 gene (sorbitol dehydrogenase), and YAL060Wand YAL061W, two adjacent genes classified as genes coding for proteins with similarity to alcohol/sorbitol dehydrogenases. Two other genes, YMR318C and YCR105W, also belong to the yeast MDR family, although they have been found to code for NADP(H)-dependent enzymes (see below). A multiple sequence alignment performed with these five gene products, together with the seven dehydrogenases of known function (mentioned in the Introduction), was used to generate a phylogenetic tree based on the neighbor-joining method of Saitou and Nei (34Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) with 1000 bootstraps. The topology of the tree with the zinc-containing MDR enzymes from yeast (Fig. 1 B) shows three main groups. Yeast glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase is in the first group, whereas the second group (formed by enzymes active with polyol substrates) is composed of two subgroups: BDH (the product of the YAL060W gene; active with 2,3-butanediol) and Yal061p (with 51% identity to BDH and of unknown function) are in the first subgroup, whereas xylitol dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and Ydl246p (active with sugars) are in the second. The third group is composed of two subgroups: the first one clusters the ethanol-active enzymes ADHI, ADHII, ADHIII, and ADHV, whereas the second is composed of two NADP(H)-dependent cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenases (Ycr105p and Ymr318p, showing 64% identity) recently characterized in our laboratory. 2C.

XDH, xylitol dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequencing demonstrated that the construct for overexpressing the YAL060W gene was correct. To easily follow the purification of the corresponding enzyme, we needed to find a specific substrate. The sequence of the enzyme was similar (>30% sequence identity) to different alcohol and sorbitol dehydrogenases. Thus, to avoid interferences with related activities, we used an alcohol dehydrogenase-deficient strain (WV36-405) to transform with a multicopy inducible vector carrying the YAL060W gene. The activity toward several alcohols was measured in the corresponding homogenate, whereas the same strain transformed with the same plasmid without insert served as a control. The best substrate for the overexpressed enzyme was (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol. The (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase-specific activity of the homogenate of the WV36-405 strain carrying the expression vector pYes2-YAL060W was 130 times higher than that of the homogenate of the control strain (10.9 versus0.08 units/mg). The product from the YAL060W gene was therefore a 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, which was later confirmed by kinetic analysis (see below). We designated the enzyme BDH. When BDH was overexpressed in yeast strain WV36-405, we found that 30% of the activity of BDH was lost from the lysate fraction after 2 h at 4 °C (in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) with 5 mm dithiothreitol). The initial activity was retained, however, in the presence of the same extraction buffer containing 30% glycerol. We decided therefore to overexpress and purify the enzyme from a protease-deficient yeast strain (BJ5459) using 30% glycerol in the buffers of all the purification steps. In addition, we had to develop a rapid protocol to purify the enzyme. Essentially, the homogenate was fractionated with a hydroxylapatite column, followed by dye-ligand chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Table I shows the results of a typical purification experiment starting with 34 g of BJ5459(pYes2-YAL060W) cells. A major step in purification was the dye-ligand chromatography. The efficiency of this step was due, in part, to the strong binding of BDH to the column. An NADH gradient did not elute the enzyme, but eliminated other dehydrogenases. High ionic strength was needed to elute BDH. After the gel filtration step, the resulting enzyme was homogeneous, as detected by a single band upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2 C). This last chromatographic step was also important to eliminate NADH, which otherwise would inhibit the oxidative reactions. The increase in specific activity after the gel filtration chromatography (Table I) is mostly a consequence of the NADH elimination since the preparation was already free from extraneous proteins after the dye-ligand chromatography (Fig.2 C). The pure enzyme was stable when kept at −80 °C with 30% glycerol for >1 month.Table IPurification of yeast (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenaseStepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmgunitsunits/mg-fold%Crude extract2185427251100Hydroxylapatite1537992531070Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose0.76493.3647269Gel filtration0.15148968392.7Activity was measured with 120 mm(2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol and 5 mm"

Insulin secretion of the pancreatic β-cell is dependent on an increase in intracellular Ca2+; however, Syt involvement in insulin exocytosis is poorly understood. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies showed the presence of Syt isoforms III, IV, V, and VII in rat pancreatic islets, whereas Syt isoforms I, II, III, IV, V, VII, and VIII were present in insulin-secreting βTC3 cell. Syt III and VII proteins were identified in rat islets and βTC3 and RINm5F β-cells by immunoblotting. Confocal microscopy showed that Syt III and VII co-localized with insulin-containing secretory granules. Two-fold overexpression of Syt III in RINm5F β-cell (Syt III cell) was achieved by stable transfection, which conferred greater Ca2+ sensitivity for exocytosis, and resulted in increased insulin secretion. Glyceraldehyde + carbachol-induced insulin secretion in Syt III cells was 2.5-fold higher than control empty vector cells, whereas potassium-induced secretion was 6-fold higher. In permeabilized Syt III cells, Ca2+-induced and mastoparan-induced insulin secretion was also increased. In Syt VII-overexpressing RINm5F β-cells, there was amplification of carbachol-induced insulin secretion in intact cells and of Ca2+-induced and mastoparan-induced insulin secretion in permeabilized cells. In conclusion, Syt III/VII are located in insulin-containing secretory granules, and we suggest that Syt III/VII may be the Ca2+sensor or one of the Ca2+ sensors for insulin exocytosis of the β-cell.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The Syt molecule has a single transmembrane domain and two Ca2+regulatory C2 domains. The C2 domains mediate Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent interactions with target molecules that may regulate membrane fusion and membrane budding reactions (24Sugita S. Sudhof T.C.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Literature concerning the expression and functions of Syt in pancreatic β-cell is very limited and contradictory. In an earlier study (26Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L.

A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), Syt was found in the non-β-cell of the islet mantle, but not in the β-cell, using a non-isoform-specific antibody, and the mRNAs of Syt A and B were absent in mouse pancreatic β-cell and RINm5F cells as demonstrated byin situ hybridization. Recently, the mRNA and protein of Syt isoforms I and II (27Lang J. Fukuda M. Zhang H. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5837-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were found in insulin-secreting β-cell lines RINm5F, INS-1, and HIT-T15. It was reported that Syt I, II (27Lang J. Fukuda M.

However, only the mRNA but not the protein was detected in primary islet β-cells (27Lang J. Fukuda M. Zhang H. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5837-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In other studies, Syt III mRNA was present in MIN6, RINm5F, HIT-T15, and βTC6-f7 (29Wheeler M.B. Sheu L. Ghai M. Bouquillon A.

The aims of the current study were to examine the expression of various Syt isoforms in pancreatic islets as well as insulin-secreting β-cell lines, the subcellular localization of Syt, and the functional role of Syt in insulin exocytosis using a β-cell line overexpressing Syt.DISCUSSIONIncreased cytosolic Ca2+ is required for secretagogue-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. The various isoforms of synaptotagmins are known to play major roles in regulated secretion of neurotransmitters in presynaptic terminals (22Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar,23Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin has been shown to bind Ca2+ in a phospholipid-dependent manner and undergoes a Ca2+-dependent conformational change that enables it to bind syntaxin on the plasma membrane for granule fusion. The expression of Syt I and II mRNA and protein in pancreatic β-cells has recently been shown in insulin-secreting β-cell lines RINm5F, INS-1, and HIT-T15 (27Lang J. Fukuda M. Zhang H. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5837-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An involvement of Syt I or II in insulin secretion of tumor cell lines is supported by the inhibition of Ca2+-induced insulin secretion in permeabilized cells using antibodies directed against the Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding site of the first C2 domain of Syt I or II. However, overexpression of Syt II in HIT-T15 β-cell failed to affect insulin secretion (27Lang J. Fukuda M. Zhang H. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5837-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, this hypothesis may not be applicable to normal pancreatic β-cells, because of the lack of Syt I and II expression in primary islet β-cell as shown previously and in this study (27Lang J. Fukuda M. Zhang H. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5837-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Syt I and II do not have a physiological role in insulin secretion and imply the presence of alternative signaling Syt proteins in the pancreatic β-cell. Another argument against the role of Syt I in insulin secretion is that it requires levels of free Ca2+ that are at least 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those observed during insulin exocytosis in the β-cells (22Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 45Littleton J.T. Bellen H.J.

Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar).Our study has discovered new Syt isoforms (IV, V, VII, and VIII) as well as confirmed previously reported Syt isoform (I, II and III) expression in βTC3 (I, II, III, IV, V, VII, and VIII), RINm5F cells (III and VII), and rat primary islet β-cells (III, IV, V, and VII). The expression of Syt VII protein in βTC3, RIMm5F, and primary rat islet is a novel finding. The absence of RT-PCR product for synaptotagmin isoforms I, II, VI, and VIII in primary rat islets suggests they are either not expressed or expressed at very low levels. The difference of isoform expression between tumor cell line and primary rat islet cell cannot be easily explained. However, this may indicate that isoforms III and VII are more physiologically important than isoforms I and II in insulin secretion. Further investigation is required to address the roles of Syt IV and V in pancreatic β-cell.An important candidate for insulin exocytosis is the Syt III isoform (47Brown H. Meister B. Deeney J. Corkey B.E. Yang S.N. Larsson O. Rhodes C.J. Seino S. Berggren P.O. Fried G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 48Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its Ca2+ sensitivity is submicromolar, which is the physiological range present in stimulated β-cells. Previous studies have mainly focused on Syt III identification in β-cells. Syt III has been found in the insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 as well as in primary islet cells (48Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syt III and VII have been localized to insulin granules in various β-cell lines and islet cells, which implicates that they may play important roles in granule fusion and exocytosis (47Brown H. Meister B. Deeney J. Corkey B.E. Yang S.N. Larsson O. Rhodes C.J. Seino S. Berggren P.O. Fried G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our study shows that by confocal microscopy, synaptotagmin III and VII co-localize with insulin secretory granules. Thus, all studies so far have localized Syt III in the β-cell and in particular to the insulin-containing secretory granule.Because of the localization of Syt III and Syt VII to the insulin secretory granule, it is conceivable that they may have a major role in insulin exocytosis, by analogy with their known role in neurotransmitter release. Treatment of permeabilized MIN6 cells with anti-Syt III antibody inhibited Ca2+-triggered insulin secretion (48Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another study reported that synaptotagmin III antibodies inhibited Ca2+-induced changes in β-cell membrane capacitance (47Brown H. Meister B. Deeney J. Corkey B.E. Yang S.N. Larsson O. Rhodes C.J. Seino S. Berggren P.O. Fried G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although indirect, these experiments implicate a role of Syt III in insulin secretion. We have directly addressed this issue by engineering insulin-secreting β-cells that overexpress Syt III or Syt VII and compared them to an empty vector Neo control β-cell line.Our results clearly show that β-cells overexpressing Syt III secrete more insulin in response to stimuli that increase intracellular Ca2+. This effect was consistently observed in intact β-cells as well as permeabilized β-cells. In normal β-cells, depolarization with K+ causes an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and subsequent insulin secretion. However, in the β-cells overexpressing Syt III, K+-induced insulin secretion was further amplified 6-fold. In the case of glyceraldehyde- and carbachol-induced insulin secretion, the amplification obtained was only 2.5-fold. This is probably due to the fact that cytosolic Ca2+ elevation is the sole mechanism for K+-induced insulin secretion, whereas glyceraldehyde and carbachol stimulate insulin secretion through increased intracellular Ca2+ as well as other mechanisms, such as activation of protein kinase C (8Wollheim C.B.

Similarly, the lack of amplification of glyceraldehyde-induced secretion in Syt III β-cells is probably due to the even lower contribution of Ca2+-dependent signaling in this pathway. Increased Ca2+-induced insulin secretion was also directly observed in permeabilized Syt III β-cells. Mastoparan, which directly triggers insulin granule fusion and exocytosis (33Konrad R.J. Young R.A. Record R.D. Smith R.M. Butkerait P. Manning D. Jarett L. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12869-12876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), also increased insulin secretion. The findings in our study suggest that Syt III and Syt VII may be the Ca2+ sensor or one of the Ca2+ sensors for insulin exocytosis of the β-cell and may be a potentially interesting target for cellular and pharmacological therapies aimed at increasing insulin secretion. The possibility that Syt IV or V isoforms play a role in Ca2+ sensing for insulin exocytosis cannot be excluded.It is interesting that both Syt III and Syt VII β-cells had increased insulin secretion induced by direct elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in permeabilized cells. However, they secreted insulin differently in response to carbachol and high K+. The amplified response to 30 mmK+ was larger in Syt III cells and not significant in Syt VII cells. On the other hand, insulin secretion triggered by carbachol was larger in Syt VII cells but was not significant in Syt III cells. The explanation of these differences is currently unclear. One possibility is that the two Syt isoforms sense changes of cytosolic Ca2+ in different subcellular locations. For example, Syt III may sense an increase in intracellular Ca2+ due to influx of extracellular Ca2+, whereas Syt VII may be relevant when intracellular Ca2+ elevation is induced by intracellular mobilization through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. It has been demonstrated that synaptotagmin directly interacts with N-type (49Leveque C. Hoshino T. David P. Shoji-Kasai Y. Leys K. Omori A. Lang B. El Far O. Sato K. Martin-Moutot N. Newsom-Davis J.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are present in pancreatic β-cells; however, it is currently unclear whether they associate with synaptotagmin.In conclusion, we have shown that isoforms III, IV, V, and VII of synaptotagmin instead of isoforms I and II are expressed in islet β-cells and that Syt III and Syt VII may have an important physiological role in insulin exocytosis of the pancreatic β-cell. The physiological roles of the other isoforms remain to be investigated.

The anti-SR-BI antibody directed against the extracellular loop of the membrane protein lowered the cellular import of the phospholipids by 40–80%. The phospholipid transfer from the lipid vesicles into the monocytes was suppressed by LDL, HDL, and apoprotein AI. Transfection of BHK cells with the cDNA for human SR-BI enhanced the cellular import of the vesicle-derived py-phospholipids by 5–6-fold. In the case of the LDL donors, transfer of py-SM to the transfected cells was stimulated to a greater extent than the uptake of the other py-phospholipids. Similar differences were not observed when the vesicles and HDL were used as phospholipid donors. The concentration of LDL required for the half-maximal phospholipid import was close to the previously reported apparent dissociation constant for LDL binding to SR-BI. The low activation energy of the SR-BI-mediated py-phospholipid import indicated that the transfer occurs entirely in a hydrophobic environment.

Currie R.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 3: R865-R867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and as cofactors of enzyme complexes mediating the proteolytic activation of coagulation proteins (2Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed over the two halves of cellular membranes, the asymmetry being generated by proteins catalyzing the transbilayer movement of the lipid molecules (3Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is also lateral separation of the phospholipids within the single monolayers. Indeed, the plasma membranes of many cells contain clusters of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific proteins known as caveolae and lipid rafts (4Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). In order to maintain the physiologic intrabilayer and intramonolayer composition of the phospholipids, the influx and efflux of the phospholipids from the plasma membranes must be tightly regulated.The cellular uptake of phospholipids from extracellular donors is part of this regulatory system. In humans, plasma lipoproteins are a major extracellular source for phospholipids. By means of the endocytosis of low density lipoproteins (LDL),1 cells also incorporate phospholipids. The capacity of different blood components to take up LDL particles by receptor-mediated endocytosis exhibits a great range of variation. For example, platelets and red blood cells barely acquire the lipoproteins through the endocytotic pathway as they lack the classic LDL receptor. Furthermore, other particles such as the high density lipoproteins (HDL), which carry equally high amounts of phospholipids as the LDL in the human plasma compartment, are in general only weakly incorporated via endocytosis.Previous data indicate a further pathway of cellular phospholipid uptake, the selective (endocytosis-independent) import of lipoprotein-derived phospholipids into the cells.The rapid phospholipid incorporation mediated by this pathway was shown to supply platelets and monocytes with highly polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid necessary for the production of the autocrine and paracrine eicosanoids (6Dobner P. Engelmann B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E777-E784PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wang P. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23235-23241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, following platelet activation, the stimulation of the import of specific phospholipids (8Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kögl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was shown to enhance the procoagulant activities of the platelet surface. The selective phospholipid import was thus shown to play a major role in the cellular uptake of essential fatty acids and to modulate intra- and extracellular signal transduction pathways. The mechanisms mediating the selective phospholipid uptake are mostly unknown. Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), a cell membrane protein previously shown to mediate the selective uptake of cholesterol (9Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17843-17850Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we studied the role of SR-BI for the selective phospholipid import into the cells. We find that SR-BI is able to form a hydrophobic environment, which allows the rapid extraction of the phospholipid from the lipoprotein donors and their subsequent insertion into the cellular acceptor membranes, the transfer of sphingomyelin (SM) from LDL to the cells being catalyzed with particular efficiency.DISCUSSIONLDL and HDL particles are the main carriers of phospholipids in the human plasma compartment. Structural models of the lipoproteins predict that the phospholipids are arranged in a monolayer that surrounds the core of the particles. Both in HDL and LDL, choline (PC, SM) and ethanolamine phospholipids (PE) form nearly 90% of total phospholipids. Although the importance of the lipoproteins for the cellular cholesterol homeostasis is well documented, much less is known about their relevance for the cellular phospholipid metabolism. By means of the cellular uptake and efflux of phospholipids, lipoproteins are able to exchange these lipid molecules with the cells. The delivery of the phospholipids to the cells can occur by a selective uptake mechanism whereby phospholipids are transferred to the cells in an endocytosis-independent manner.SR-BI was previously shown to mediate the selective uptake of different cholesterol species into the cells (9Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 10Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. DeMattos R.B.

In particular, SR-BI was found to catalyze the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine (12Hauser H. Dyer J.H. Nandy A. Vega M.A. Werder M. Bieliauskaite E. Weber F.E. Compassi S. Gemperli A. Boffelli D. Wehrli E. Schulthess G. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17843-17850Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and to deliver the sterol to adrenal cells (20Wang N. Wenig W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), where it might serve as the precursor for the synthesis of steroid hormones. The prominent role of SR-BI in the translocations of cholesterol led us to investigate its function for the selective phospholipid import. We first analyzed the effect of the anti-SR-BI antibody on the transfer of the major lipoprotein phospholipids into the monocytes, blood cells that constitutively express SR-BI. The antibody markedly reduced the cellular phospholipid import indicating that SR-BI catalyzed the greater part of the phospholipid uptake by the monocytes. SR-BI appeared to be absent from platelets, blood components that incorporate phospholipids predominantly by the endocytosis-independent pathway. The platelet phospholipid import was previously shown to be protein-mediated (8Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kögl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Engelmann B. Kögl C. Kulschar R. Schaipp B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Platelets will thus provide a valuable model for studying the SR-BI-independent phospholipid uptake in future studies. In BHK cells transfected with the cDNA for human SR-BI, the selective incorporation of the phospholipids was strongly enhanced. These data confirmed that SR-BI promotes the phospholipid import into the cells. Thus, SR-BI represents the first membrane protein known to mediate the endocytosis-independent cellular uptake of phospholipids.LDL and HDL particles were shown to serve as donors for the SR-BI-catalyzed cellular uptake of the phospholipids. The LDL concentration allowing half-maximal phospholipid import through SR-BI (Fig. 5) was in the same range as the K d for the LDL binding to SR-BI (around 5 μg of protein/ml; Ref. 15Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the lipoprotein binding to SR-BI is essential for the delivery of the phospholipids. In addition, SR-BI was found to transfer phospholipids from pure vesicles into the cells. The latter finding indicates that SR-BI is in principle able to directly interact with the phospholipids of the donors, independent of the presence of the apoproteins. The lipoproteins inhibited the transfer of the phospholipids from the lipid vesicles to the cells. Apparently, the different phospholipid donors competed for the interaction with SR-BI. Together, these data suggest that the interaction of SR-BI with the phospholipids of the lipoprotein monolayer might be sufficient for the delivery of the phospholipids to the cells, as discussed previously (14Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, apoAI alone also reduced the phospholipid exchange between the lipid vesicles and the cells. This apoprotein is likely to mediate the interaction of HDL with SR-BI. Thus, at least in the case of phospholipid transfer between the HDL particles and the cells, the apoprotein component might also be involved in the phospholipid exchange catalyzed by SR-BI. Overall, the results are in line with the view that SR-BI represents a multiligand protein with binding sites for both apoproteins and phospholipids. It remains to be investigated how the interplay between the different ligands precisely regulates the lipid uptake via SR-BI.The activation energies for the SR-BI-catalyzed py-SM transfer across the extracellular medium were calculated to amount to 7–8 kcal/mol. A similar value has previously been obtained for the activation energy of the SR-BI-mediated translocation of cholesteryl esters (21Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Importantly, the diffusion of SM through the aqueous phase is known to require activation energies of 21–25 kcal/mol (22Brown R.E. Hilderson H.J. Subcellular Biochemistry. 16. Plenum Press, New York1991: 333-363Google Scholar). Thus, SR-BI is able to reduce the activation energy for the SM transfer between the two lipidic compartments by about two thirds. Our data suggest that the protein-mediated transfer of SM across the extracellular medium takes place in a hydrophobic environment. The SR-BI-mediated transfer process, which involves the extraction of the phospholipid from the donor (desorption) and the insertion of the phospholipid into the acceptor cells, thus occurs in a way that contact of the phospholipid with water is completely excluded.When analyzing the transfer of the phospholipids from the HDL particles to the cells, we noticed that SR-BI catalyzed the incorporation of PE, PC, and SM with rather equal efficiency. The transfer of the vesicle-derived phospholipids was also stimulated to a similar degree by SR-BI. A different pattern was observed when LDL particles were employed as phospholipid donors. In this case, SM was more efficiently transferred to the cells by SR-BI as compared with PC and PE. Previous work indicates that SR-BI plays an important role in the metabolism of LDL and apoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins in general. Overexpression of SR-BI led to a marked reduction in the plasma contents of lipoproteins with apoB (23Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and polymorphisms in the SR-BI gene were found to be associated with variations in the plasma LDL concentrations (24Acton S. Osgood D. Donoghue M. Corella D. Pocovi M. Cenarro A. Mozas P. Keilty J. Squazzo S. Woolf E.A. Ordovas J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1734-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SR-BI was found to bind LDL with high affinity (15Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to supply cells with cholesteryl esters (25Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

Earlier investigations show that the LDL-associated PC is mostly bound to apoB100, the major protein component of the lipoprotein. In contrast, the greater proportion of SM is able to move freely within the LDL phospholipid monolayer (26Sommer A. Prenner E. Gorges R. Stütz H. Grillhofer H. Kostner G.M. Paltauf F. Hermetter A.

In the HDL particles, the movements of SM are most probably restricted due to the interaction of the sphingolipid with apoAI (28Molotkovsky J.G. Manevich Y.M. Gerasimova E.N. Molotkovskaya I.M. Polessky V.A. Bergelson L.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to other factors, these particular phospholipid-protein interactions may contribute to the impaired capacity of discoidal HDL to deliver SM (as compared with PC) via SR-BI (21Rodrigueza W.V.

Taken together, it appears likely that the LDL-associated SM is more easily available for the interaction with SR-BI compared with the LDL bound PC. This most probably facilitates the desorption of the sphingolipid from the LDL monolayer by SR-BI. Overall, the results indicate that the structure of the donor particle plays a critical role in determining the selectivity of the SR-BI-mediated phospholipid uptake.The phospholipids of the plasma membranes are not only asymmetrically distributed over the two leaflets, they are also laterally separated within the membranes. Sphingolipids such as SM are clustered within the cell membranes in caveolae and lipid rafts, together with cholesterol, caveolin-1, and other specific proteins (4Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). When the caveolae were disrupted by treating them for different time periods with cyclodextrin, the SR-BI-mediated SM uptake was increasingly reduced. Thus, intact caveolae are required for the phospholipid uptake. On the other hand, SR-BI was previously shown to be localized in caveolae and to transfer its substrates into these membrane domains (18Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results of the present and earlier investigations suggest that SR-BI promotes the uptake of the two major lipid components of the caveolae, namely SM and cholesterol.In conclusion, SR-BI is shown to catalyze the transfer of the major lipoprotein-associated phospholipids into the cells. Lipoproteins and pure lipid vesicles can principally serve as phospholipid donors for the SR-BI-mediated phospholipid uptake. However, the preferential stimulation of the import of LDL-derived SM by SR-BI indicates that the monolayer structure of the donor lipoprotein is of relevance for the facilitation of the phospholipid transfer. Although intact sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich areas of the plasma membrane are required for the efficient insertion of the phospholipid into the cells, SR-BI is also likely to contribute to the maintenance of these domains by supplying their main lipid constituents. Phospholipids are known to play essential roles in a multitude of cellular processes such as, for example, in intracellular signal transduction (1Downes C.P. Currie R.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 3: R865-R867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and as cofactors of enzyme complexes mediating the proteolytic activation of coagulation proteins (2Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed over the two halves of cellular membranes, the asymmetry being generated by proteins catalyzing the transbilayer movement of the lipid molecules (3Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is also lateral separation of the phospholipids within the single monolayers. Indeed, the plasma membranes of many cells contain clusters of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific proteins known as caveolae and lipid rafts (4Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). In order to maintain the physiologic intrabilayer and intramonolayer composition of the phospholipids, the influx and efflux of the phospholipids from the plasma membranes must be tightly regulated. The cellular uptake of phospholipids from extracellular donors is part of this regulatory system. In humans, plasma lipoproteins are a major extracellular source for phospholipids. By means of the endocytosis of low density lipoproteins (LDL),1 cells also incorporate phospholipids. The capacity of different blood components to take up LDL particles by receptor-mediated endocytosis exhibits a great range of variation. For example, platelets and red blood cells barely acquire the lipoproteins through the endocytotic pathway as they lack the classic LDL receptor. Furthermore, other particles such as the high density lipoproteins (HDL), which carry equally high amounts of phospholipids as the LDL in the human plasma compartment, are in general only weakly incorporated via endocytosis. Previous data indicate a further pathway of cellular phospholipid uptake, the selective (endocytosis-independent) import of lipoprotein-derived phospholipids into the cells. The rapid phospholipid incorporation mediated by this pathway was shown to supply platelets and monocytes with highly polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid necessary for the production of the autocrine and paracrine eicosanoids (6Dobner P. Engelmann B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E777-E784PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wang P. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23235-23241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, following platelet activation, the stimulation of the import of specific phospholipids (8Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kögl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was shown to enhance the procoagulant activities of the platelet surface. The selective phospholipid import was thus shown to play a major role in the cellular uptake of essential fatty acids and to modulate intra- and extracellular signal transduction pathways. The mechanisms mediating the selective phospholipid uptake are mostly unknown. Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), a cell membrane protein previously shown to mediate the selective uptake of cholesterol (9Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar,10Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. DeMattos R.B. Temel R.E. Krieger M. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33545-33549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), could also be involved in the cellular incorporation of the phospholipids (11Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 12Hauser H. Dyer J.H. Nandy A. Vega M.A. Werder M. Bieliauskaite E. Weber F.E. Compassi S. Gemperli A. Boffelli D. Wehrli E. Schulthess G. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17843-17850Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we studied the role of SR-BI for the selective phospholipid import into the cells. We find that SR-BI is able to form a hydrophobic environment, which allows the rapid extraction of the phospholipid from the lipoprotein donors and their subsequent insertion into the cellular acceptor membranes, the transfer of sphingomyelin (SM) from LDL to the cells being catalyzed with particular efficiency. DISCUSSIONLDL and HDL particles are the main carriers of phospholipids in the human plasma compartment. Structural models of the lipoproteins predict that the phospholipids are arranged in a monolayer that surrounds the core of the particles. Both in HDL and LDL, choline (PC, SM) and ethanolamine phospholipids (PE) form nearly 90% of total phospholipids. Although the importance of the lipoproteins for the cellular cholesterol homeostasis is well documented, much less is known about their relevance for the cellular phospholipid metabolism. By means of the cellular uptake and efflux of phospholipids, lipoproteins are able to exchange these lipid molecules with the cells. The delivery of the phospholipids to the cells can occur by a selective uptake mechanism whereby phospholipids are transferred to the cells in an endocytosis-independent manner.SR-BI was previously shown to mediate the selective uptake of different cholesterol species into the cells (9Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 10Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. DeMattos R.B. Temel R.E. Krieger M. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33545-33549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and to promote the efflux of free and esterified cholesterol (11Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In particular, SR-BI was found to catalyze the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine (12Hauser H. Dyer J.H. Nandy A. Vega M.A. Werder M. Bieliauskaite E. Weber F.E. Compassi S. Gemperli A. Boffelli D. Wehrli E. Schulthess G. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17843-17850Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and to deliver the sterol to adrenal cells (20Wang N. Wenig W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), where it might serve as the precursor for the synthesis of steroid hormones. The prominent role of SR-BI in the translocations of cholesterol led us to investigate its function for the selective phospholipid import. We first analyzed the effect of the anti-SR-BI antibody on the transfer of the major lipoprotein phospholipids into the monocytes, blood cells that constitutively express SR-BI. The antibody markedly reduced the cellular phospholipid import indicating that SR-BI catalyzed the greater part of the phospholipid uptake by the monocytes. SR-BI appeared to be absent from platelets, blood components that incorporate phospholipids predominantly by the endocytosis-independent pathway. The platelet phospholipid import was previously shown to be protein-mediated (8Engelmann B. Schaipp B. Dobner P. Stoeckelhuber M. Kögl C. Siess W. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27800-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Engelmann B. Kögl C. Kulschar R. Schaipp B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Platelets will thus provide a valuable model for studying the SR-BI-independent phospholipid uptake in future studies. In BHK cells transfected with the cDNA for human SR-BI, the selective incorporation of the phospholipids was strongly enhanced. These data confirmed that SR-BI promotes the phospholipid import into the cells. Thus, SR-BI represents the first membrane protein known to mediate the endocytosis-independent cellular uptake of phospholipids.LDL and HDL particles were shown to serve as donors for the SR-BI-catalyzed cellular uptake of the phospholipids. The LDL concentration allowing half-maximal phospholipid import through SR-BI (Fig. 5) was in the same range as the K d for the LDL binding to SR-BI (around 5 μg of protein/ml; Ref. 15Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the lipoprotein binding to SR-BI is essential for the delivery of the phospholipids. In addition, SR-BI was found to transfer phospholipids from pure vesicles into the cells. The latter finding indicates that SR-BI is in principle able to directly interact with the phospholipids of the donors, independent of the presence of the apoproteins. The lipoproteins inhibited the transfer of the phospholipids from the lipid vesicles to the cells. Apparently, the different phospholipid donors competed for the interaction with SR-BI. Together, these data suggest that the interaction of SR-BI with the phospholipids of the lipoprotein monolayer might be sufficient for the delivery of the phospholipids to the cells, as discussed previously (14Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, apoAI alone also reduced the phospholipid exchange between the lipid vesicles and the cells. This apoprotein is likely to mediate the interaction of HDL with SR-BI. Thus, at least in the case of phospholipid transfer between the HDL particles and the cells, the apoprotein component might also be involved in the phospholipid exchange catalyzed by SR-BI. Overall, the results are in line with the view that SR-BI represents a multiligand protein with binding sites for both apoproteins and phospholipids. It remains to be investigated how the interplay between the different ligands precisely regulates the lipid uptake via SR-BI.The activation energies for the SR-BI-catalyzed py-SM transfer across the extracellular medium were calculated to amount to 7–8 kcal/mol. A similar value has previously been obtained for the activation energy of the SR-BI-mediated translocation of cholesteryl esters (21Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Importantly, the diffusion of SM through the aqueous phase is known to require activation energies of 21–25 kcal/mol (22Brown R.E. Hilderson H.J. Subcellular Biochemistry. 16. Plenum Press, New York1991: 333-363Google Scholar). Thus, SR-BI is able to reduce the activation energy for the SM transfer between the two lipidic compartments by about two thirds. Our data suggest that the protein-mediated transfer of SM across the extracellular medium takes place in a hydrophobic environment. The SR-BI-mediated transfer process, which involves the extraction of the phospholipid from the donor (desorption) and the insertion of the phospholipid into the acceptor cells, thus occurs in a way that contact of the phospholipid with water is completely excluded.When analyzing the transfer of the phospholipids from the HDL particles to the cells, we noticed that SR-BI catalyzed the incorporation of PE, PC, and SM with rather equal efficiency. The transfer of the vesicle-derived phospholipids was also stimulated to a similar degree by SR-BI. A different pattern was observed when LDL particles were employed as phospholipid donors. In this case, SM was more efficiently transferred to the cells by SR-BI as compared with PC and PE. Previous work indicates that SR-BI plays an important role in the metabolism of LDL and apoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins in general. Overexpression of SR-BI led to a marked reduction in the plasma contents of lipoproteins with apoB (23Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and polymorphisms in the SR-BI gene were found to be associated with variations in the plasma LDL concentrations (24Acton S. Osgood D. Donoghue M. Corella D. Pocovi M. Cenarro A. Mozas P. Keilty J. Squazzo S. Woolf E.A. Ordovas J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1734-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SR-BI was found to bind LDL with high affinity (15Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to supply cells with cholesteryl esters (25Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29733-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Earlier investigations show that the LDL-associated PC is mostly bound to apoB100, the major protein component of the lipoprotein. In contrast, the greater proportion of SM is able to move freely within the LDL phospholipid monolayer (26Sommer A. Prenner E. Gorges R. Stütz H. Grillhofer H. Kostner G.M. Paltauf F. Hermetter A.

Commun. 1997; 234: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the HDL particles, the movements of SM are most probably restricted due to the interaction of the sphingolipid with apoAI (28Molotkovsky J.G. Manevich Y.M. Gerasimova E.N. Molotkovskaya I.M. Polessky V.A. Bergelson L.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to other factors, these particular phospholipid-protein interactions may contribute to the impaired capacity of discoidal HDL to deliver SM (as compared with PC) via SR-BI (21Rodrigueza W.V.

Sphingolipids such as SM are clustered within the cell membranes in caveolae and lipid rafts, together with cholesterol, caveolin-1, and other specific proteins (4Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev.

In addition to other factors, these particular phospholipid-protein interactions may contribute to the impaired capacity of discoidal HDL to deliver SM (as compared with PC) via SR-BI (21Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears likely that the LDL-associated SM is more easily available for the interaction with SR-BI compared with the LDL bound PC. This most probably facilitates the desorption of the sphingolipid from the LDL monolayer by SR-BI. Overall, the results indicate that the structure of the donor particle plays a critical role in determining the selectivity of the SR-BI-mediated phospholipid uptake. The phospholipids of the plasma membranes are not only asymmetrically distributed over the two leaflets, they are also laterally separated within the membranes. Sphingolipids such as SM are clustered within the cell membranes in caveolae and lipid rafts, together with cholesterol, caveolin-1, and other specific proteins (4Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). When the caveolae were disrupted by treating them for different time periods with cyclodextrin, the SR-BI-mediated SM uptake was increasingly reduced. Thus, intact caveolae are required for the phospholipid uptake. On the other hand, SR-BI was previously shown to be localized in caveolae and to transfer its substrates into these membrane domains (18Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results of the present and earlier investigations suggest that SR-BI promotes the uptake of the two major lipid components of the caveolae, namely SM and cholesterol. In conclusion, SR-BI is shown to catalyze the transfer of the major lipoprotein-associated phospholipids into the cells. Lipoproteins and pure lipid vesicles can principally serve as phospholipid donors for the SR-BI-mediated phospholipid uptake. However, the preferential stimulation of the import of LDL-derived SM by SR-BI indicates that the monolayer structure of the donor lipoprotein is of relevance for the facilitation of the phospholipid transfer. Although intact sphingolipid-cholesterol-rich areas of the plasma membrane are required for the efficient insertion of the phospholipid into the cells, SR-BI is also likely to contribute to the maintenance of these domains by supplying their main lipid constituents.

https://openalex.org/W2135715579,"The influence of reversible protein phosphorylation on nucleosome assembly during DNA replication was analyzed in extracts from human cells. Inhibitor studies and add-back experiments indicated requirements of cyclin A/Cdk2, cyclin E/Cdk2, and protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) activities for nucleosome assembly during DNA synthesis by chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1). The p60 subunit of CAF-1 is a molecular target for reversible phosphorylation by cyclin/Cdk complexes and PP1 during nucleosome assembly and DNA synthesis in vitro. Purified p60 can be directly phosphorylated by purified cyclin A/Cdk2, cyclin E/Cdk2, and cyclin B1/Cdk1, but not by cyclin D/Cdk4 complexes in vitro. Cyclin B1/Cdk1 triggers hyperphosphorylation of p60 in the presence of additional cytosolic factors. CAF-1 containing hyperphosphorylated p60 prepared from mitotic cells is inactive in nucleosome assembly and becomes activated by dephosphorylation in vitro. These data provide functional evidence for a requirement of the cell cycle machinery for nucleosome assembly by CAF-1 during DNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W1989494641,"It can be argued from the principle of solvent exclusion that the introduction of hydrophobic residues onto the surface of a protein will not destabilize the folded state because the nonpolar side chain will be at least as exposed in the unfolded state as it is when the protein chain is folded. A comparison of the folding pathway of wild type and 11 site-directed mutants of CD2.d1 shows this to be true. In fact, owing to partial burial of nonpolar groups as folding proceeds, we find that the rapidly formed intermediate state and, to a greater extent, the transition state are generally stabilized by hydrophobic surface mutations. This effect is slightly moderated in the folded state presumably by the perturbation of van der Waals' contacts and/or local electrostatic interactions that have a greater influence in this fully compact structure. The fact that in all but one case we find that stabilization of the rapidly collapsed intermediate is accompanied by a faster acquisition of the folded state refutes the argument that I states are generally “off pathway” conformations or ensembles that lead to the inhibition of otherwise more rapid folding trajectories.

Cluster determinant molecule domain 1 guanidinium hydrochloride intermediate state Although a large body of data exists on the effect of hydrophobic core mutations on the folding and stability of proteins (Refs. 1Rose G.D.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2734-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the great majority of the surface of proteins is made up of hydrophillic groups, the replacement of polar surface residues with nonpolar should, by the principle of hydrophobic burial, have little effect on protein stability. This is because in the unfolded state the nonpolar groups will be at least as exposed to solvent as they are in the folded state. By this argument the evolutionary drive to acquire a surface shell of polar residues arises from the need to maintain solubility rather than stability. The aim of this study we present here is to examine this hypothesis using the all-β-sheet protein, CD2.d11 (7Driscoll P.C. Cyster J.G.K. Campbell I.D. Williams A.F. Nature. 1991; 353: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), as a test bed system. This protein is a single-domain structure belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily that folds through a well characterized intermediate state. To examine the effect of surface hydrophobicity, nonpolar residues were engineered into sites on the protein that are extensively exposed to solvent in the folded state. With respect to the mutation sites the following aspects were taken into account. First, the hydrophobic residues were engineered into extended β-stands rather than into loop regions to avoid interpretative complications because of potential mobility of the main chain in loop regions. Second, to minimize the contribution of packing interactions to the difference in conformational stability between the mutant and the wild type protein, the mutations were sterically conservative (i.e. threonine → valine or asparagine → leucine). Thirdly, the introduced hydrophobic side chains were intended to avoid the perturbation of electrostatic effects, i.e.intramolecular hydrogen bonding and coulombic interactions. Fourthly, the β-sheet propensities of the introduced residues were very similar to those they replaced (8Minor D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1994; 367: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 9Simth C.K. Withka J.M. Regan L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5510-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 10Kim C.A.

With this in mind the folding dynamics of the CD2.d1 mutants were dissected by use of denaturant-dependent kinetic analysis to assess effects on the stability of intermediate, transition, and folded states. Interpretation of the folding data is simplified by the lack of disulphide bonds and proline-isomerization complicating the folding reaction of CD2.d1 (11Parker M.J. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5786-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant proteins were prepared and purified as described previously (11Parker M.J. Clarke A.R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1377-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by UV absorption of aromatic residues at 280 nm (5500m−1 cm−1 for tryptophan (two residues) and 1100 m−1 cm−1 for tyrosine (two residues)). Consecutive additions of a concentrated stock of GuHCl were made to a 2 μm solution of CD2.d1, at an appropriate temperature, in 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7, in a quartz cuvette. With each addition, the solution was mixed thoroughly, and the reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium before the fluorescence intensity was recorded. An excitation wavelength of 285 nm was selected by a single monochromator (slit width, 1 μm) from a xenon light source, and the fluorescence intensity at 330 nm was recorded using a single emission monochromator (slit width, 5 μm) in a Spex Fluoromax spectrofluorometer. All data were corrected for dilution. Folding reactions were initiated by mixing a 10 μmsolution of unfolded CD2.d1 containing 50 mmtriethanolamine, and 3 m GuHCl (in some cases additional measurements using 1.5 m GuHCl were performed), against 10 volumes of an appropriate concentration of GuHCl at 298 K in an SX.18MV stopped flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). An excitation wavelength of 298 nm was selected by a single monochromator (bandpass, 5 nm) from a mercury-xenon light source. The fluorescence intensity above 320 nm was recorded using an emission cut-off filter. For the unfolding reactions, a 10 μm solution of folded CD2.d1 in 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2, was mixed against 10 volumes of an appropriate concentration of GuHCl, and the reaction was recorded as above. For the analysis of equilibrium and kinetic data, guanidinium hydrochloride concentration ([GuHCl]) is converted to molar denaturant activity (D), according to the following relationship. D=C0.5·[GuHCl]/(C0.5+[GuHCl])Equation 1 where C 0.5 is a denaturation constant with a value of 7.5 m (13Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol.

Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The transients of fluorescence intensity (I) versus time, which are single, first order processes, in both the folding and unfolding directions, were fitted to the equation, I =I a·(1 − exp{−k·t}) + I o for rising intensities (where I a is the fluorescence amplitude of the reaction, k is the observed rate constant for the relaxation, and I o is the initial intensity), and to I =I a·exp(−k·t) +I f for decreasing intensities (whereI f is the final fluorescence intensity). To model the kinetics of folding and unfolding of CD2.d1 the following minimal mechanism was assumed. U⇌I⇌FMECHANISM1As a consequence, rate profiles (observed rate constant (k obs) versus denaturant activity (a D)) were fitted to Equation 6 (see Parkeret al. (13Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)).kobs=ku+kf/(1+1/KI/U)Equation 6 where k f and k uare rate constants describing the forward and reverse steps, respectively, between the folded and intermediate states, andK I/U is the equilibrium constant for the rapid interconversion of the intermediate and unfolded states. In the fitting routine the following temporary variables were used.ku=ku(w)·exp{−mt·aD}Equation 7 kf=kf(w)·exp{[ml−mt]·aD}Equation 8 KI/U=KI/U(w)·exp{[mU−ml]·aD}Equation 9 Here, the subscript “w” denotes the rate and equilibrium constants in water. The m values describe the shifts in the stabilities of each state (designated by the subscript) as a function of denaturant activity (a D) and have units ofm−1 (note that these shifts are measured relative to the fully folded state, F). All data were fitted using the Grafit analysis software (Erithracus Software). When fitting kinetic data to Equation 6, proportional weighting was used, so that the fitted values took account of rate constants equally across the whole range. The coordinates for wild type CD2.d1 (14Jones E.Y. Davis S.J. Williams A.F. Harlos Stuart D.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Brookhaven protein data bank. Mutant side chains were introduced into the model from a library of allowed rotamers using the molecular graphics program Insight II (MSI). The energy-minimized structure was then used to calculate the solvent-accessible surface area of the folded state by applying the Connolly (15Connolly M.L. Science. 1983; 221: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar) method with a water probe radius = 1.7 Å.

Science. 1983; 221: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar) to a tripeptide of sequence GXG (where Xrepresents the mutated residue) as a model for the unfolded state (1Rose G.D.

Five single mutants (N15L, N17L, N77L, T79V, and N90L) and six double mutants (N15L/N77L, N15L/T79V, N15L/N90L, N17L/N77L, N17L/T79V, and T79V/N90L) were included in this study. All fluorescence transients collected for the folding and unfolding reactions of the proteins exhibited single-exponential behavior, and the kinetics of folding reactions were insensitive to protein concentration, showing that there was no transient aggregation upon refolding (data not shown). Free energies measured by kinetics and equilibrium unfolding experiments (data not shown) are equivalent within error (± 0.3 kcal/mol). The denaturant dependence of the observed rate constant (k obs) for folding and unfolding of the wild type and the mutant proteins is shown in Fig.2. The rate profile of T79V has been fitted to a two-state mechanism (U → F), because the folding limb is linear. Rate profiles obtained from all other mutants and the wild type, however, exhibit a deviation from linearity in the folding limb of the plot, thus indicating the transient accumulation of a folding intermediate in strong folding conditions (D < 0.7m) according to the following minimal mechanism.U⇌KI/UI⇌kukfFMECHANISM 2Interpretation of the data is dependent on the assumption that the mutations do not affect the protein folding pathway. This assumption is validated by the faithful additivity of effects in the double mutants (Fig. 3).Figure 3The folding free energy of the double mutants (ΔGF/U(double mutant)) is plotted against the sum of the folding free energies of the constituent single mutants (ΔGF/U(single mutant 1) + ΔGF/U(single mutant 2)). When fitted to the equation (GF/U(double mutant) =A·[(GF/U(single mutant 1) + (GF/U(single mutant 2)] -6.4, the resulting straight line has a slope of A = 1.00 (±0.01).Error bars reflect accumulated standard errors as determined by using standard statistical formulae.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dissection of the folding reaction by transient kinetic analysis reveals a consistent trend among the mutants (TableI). In all but two cases the mutant proteins have a stabilized intermediate with respect to the unfolded state. The average stabilization among all the mutants is 0.3 kcal/mol. Accompanying this effect is an increase in the folding rate of the mutants that reveals that the transition state is further stabilized. Taking the unfolded state as a reference, the transition state is stabilized by an average of 0.6 kcal/mol. Hence, in nine of eleven cases, the stabilization of the intermediate state is accompanied by a substantial enhancement of the folding rate (Table I), i.e.as folding proceeds surface hydrophobicity has a progressively greater effect.Table IKinetic folding parameters for variants of CD2.d1 and the wild type of CD2.d1 at 298 KMutant−ΔG F/U(kin)−ΔG I/Uk fk um Um Im tkcal/molkcal/mols −1[10 −3 · s −1 ]Wild type6.4 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.16.6 ± 0.40.68 ± 0.08−7.73 ± 0.26−4.45 ± 0.61−2.78 ± 0.03N15L8.5 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.310.4 ± 0.70.063 ± 0.013−8.29 ± 0.31−5.07 ± 0.44−3.26 ± 0.08N17L6.6 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.310.6 ± 0.51.22 ± 0.13−7.68 ± 0.31−4.38 ± 0.42−2.54 ± 0.05N77L6.8 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.28.5 ± 1.00.75 ± 0.07−8.09 ± 0.21−4.84 ± 0.39−3.02 ± 0.04T79V4.8 ± 0.1a18.2 ± 0.85.13 ± 0.49−6.25 ± 0.05a−2.21 ± 0.05N90L6.2 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.19.5 ± 0.74.60 ± 0.26−7.45 ± 0.10−2.67 ± 0.28−2.22 ± 0.03N15L/N77L8.4 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.310.6 ± 0.90.13 ± 0.03−8.05 ± 0.26−4.60 ± 0.37−3.24 ± 0.11N15L/T79V7.3 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.110.7 ± 1.10.77 ± 0.01−7.82 ± 0.32−4.13 ± 0.43−2.74 ± 0.05N15L/N90L8.1 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.113.4 ± 1.10.48 ± 0.06−8.08 ± 0.15−3.66 ± 0.24−2.88 ± 0.06N17L/N77L6.3 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.29.8 ± 1.11.53 ± 0.19−7.29 ± 0.26−3.85 ± 0.54−2.66 ± 0.05N17L/T79V5.3 ± 0.1−0.5 ± 0.116.9 ± 2.16.63 ± 0.55−6.51 ± 0.13−3.29 ± 0.77−2.16 ± 0.04T79V/N90L5.0 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.317.8 ± 2.736.22 ± 5.24−6.43 ± 0.43−2.19 ± 0.84−2.10 ± 0.07ΔG F/U, Gibbs free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant.

The impact of the mutations on the fully folded state, however, is less consistent and has a wider range. Although, on average, the mutations lead to a slightly more stable folded state (ΔΔG = −0.2 kcal/mol), some mutants are highly destabilized (ΔΔG for T79V = +1.6 kcal/mol), and others are much more stable (ΔΔG for N15L = -2.1 kcal/mol). Previous studies (19Matouschek A. Serrano L. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Serrano L. Matouschek A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

Biol. 1992; 224: 783-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) have shown that hydrogen bond networks and Coulombic interactions on protein surfaces are predominantly manifested in the fully folded state and have little effect on preceding states. We therefore attribute this wider variation to a greater intimacy of inter-residue contacts when the molecule is fully folded. The consistent influence of the mutations on the intermediate and transition states is most simply explained by partial burial of the introduced side chains during folding. Estimating the expected stabilization occasioned by the amino acid substitutions can test the plausibility of this explanation. The free energy of transfer of a residue from an aqueous environment to a protein interior has been estimated from the partition of model compounds between water and octanol (22Nozaki Y. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2211-2221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 59-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Across all mutations made in this study, the mean value for complete burial of the newly introduced hydrophobic residues would be −3.6 kcal/mol. However, inspection of the folded structure shows that the average burial of the mutated side chains is only 21%. Hence, the expected mean effect on the folded state would be (0.21 × −3.6) −0.76 kcal/mol. Analysis of m values shows that overall side chain burial in the intermediate state is 48% of that in the folded structure, and in the transition state this rises to 65%. Thus, the expectation from this admittedly crude calculation is that the intermediate state would be stabilized, on average, by 0.36 kcal/mol and the transition state by 0.50 kcal/mol. These values lie sufficiently close to those measured (0.3 and 0.6 kcal/mol) to render the explanation tenable. Indeed, the plot of ΔΔG calculated versusΔΔG measured shown in Fig.4 has a slope close to unity. Other studies on the effects of surface hydrophobicity have reached somewhat contradictory conclusions. Pakula and Sauer (5Pakula A.A. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1990; 344: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) observed that mutations at a single, hyper-exposed site of λ Cro resulted in a good correlation between increasing stability and decreasing surface hydrophobicity. It was suggested that this resulted from the site being more solvent exposed in the folded than the unfolded state. Hence, the energetic cost of solvating the nonpolar side chain was greatest in the folded state, leading to its destabilization relative to the unfolded state. In essence, these observations accord with our own. Similarly, a study of surface-exposed phenylalanines in cold shock protein B showed that their replacement by alanine destabilizes the folded state (4Schindler T. Perl D. Graumann P. Sieber V. Maraheil M.A. Schimd F.X. Proteins Struct. Func. Genet. 1998; 30: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As in this paper, Schindler et al. argued that partial burial of the phenyl groups in the wild type protein had a stabilizing influence. Gu et al. (6Gu H. Doshi N. Kim D.E. Simons K.T. Santiago J.V. Nauli S. Baker D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2734-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), on the other hand, have observed a general decrease in protein stability with increasing surface hydrophobicity, although some of the substitutions were much less sterically conservative than those presented in this study. The most emphasized observation was that the mutations did not slow down the folding rate. Interestingly, Gu et al. interpreted this result as supporting the argument that the rate-limiting step in folding is not the time taken to undergo an unrestricted combinatorial search through alternative core-packing arrangements. This interpretation is similar to that we make below about productive folding intermediates and misfolded ensembles. The most intriguing aspect of this study, is not the general influence of surface hydrophobicity on the stability of CD2.d1, but the consistent demonstration that by site-directed mutagenesis, it is possible to couple a folding rate enhancement with the stabilization of an early folding intermediate. This aspect directly addresses the kinetic relevance of early folding intermediates and thus sheds light on a lively debate about the role of intermediate states in the process of structure acquisition (for reviews see Refs. 24Baldwin R.L. Folding Design. 1996; 1: R1-R8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 25Clarke A.R. Waltho J.P. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1997; 8: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Roder H. Colón W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It has repeatedly been argued that intermediates could be identified by a retardation of the folding rate (27Creighton T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Oliveberg M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 765-772Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The reasoning behind this argument is as follows. For a two-state folding reaction, a plot ofk obs versus denaturant activity follows a simple V pattern. For a three-state reaction, the folding limb is curved (Fig. 2), so that the rate in the absence of denaturant is slower than would be expected from an extrapolation of the data from the base of the folding limb where the intermediate is not populated. This is taken to mean that the formation of the “intermediate” retards an otherwise faster two-state folding process. In structural terms, such an interpretation defines the intermediate as an unproductive randomly collapsed ensemble containing non-native structure that has to be undone before productive folding can occur,i.e. folding occurs from the unfolded state and the intermediate should be renamed a misfolded state. The folding rates (k f) for each model can be described by the following equations.kf=k(I→F)/(1+1/K(I/U))ork(U→F)/(1+K(M/U))Equation 10 where the subscripts U, I, and F represent unfolded, productive intermediate and folded states, and M represents the misfolded ensemble. These equations illustrate the impossibility of distinguishing, by formal kinetics, between a U-to-I and a U-to-M pre-equilibrium. However, it has been extensively documented that the transition state resembles an expanded form of the folded state with extensive native-like structure (29Fersht A.R. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 1997; 7: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The fact that the mutations give a progressive stabilization of I and transition states as the reaction proceeds strongly implies that the I state belongs on a structural progression along the U → I → t → F trajectory and that the rapidly formed I state in the folding of CD2.d1 is on pathway. This result supports the previous arguments based on exchange protection data (30Parker M.J. Dempsey C.E. Lorch M. Clarke A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13396-13405Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Parker M.J. Dempsey C.E. Hosszu L.L.P. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that the I state is topologically native-like rather than randomly collapsed. We thank Prof. D.
