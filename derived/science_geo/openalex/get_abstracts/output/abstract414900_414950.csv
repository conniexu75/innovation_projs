To capture these events, we developed a sensitive method to tag and track pancreatic epithelial cells in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Tagged cells invaded and entered the bloodstream unexpectedly early, before frank malignancy could be detected by rigorous histologic analysis; this behavior was widely associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Circulating pancreatic cells maintained a mesenchymal phenotype, exhibited stem cell properties, and seeded the liver. EMT and invasiveness were most abundant at inflammatory foci, and induction of pancreatitis increased the number of circulating pancreatic cells. Conversely, treatment with the immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone abolished dissemination. These results provide insight into the earliest events of cellular invasion in situ and suggest that inflammation enhances cancer progression in part by facilitating EMT and entry into the circulation.

Invading cells exhibit EMT in an autochthonous model of pancreatic cancer Mutant cells enter the circulation before cancer is found on histology Circulating pancreatic cells (CPCs) express cancer stem cell-associated markers Inflammation is necessary and sufficient for EMT, invasion, and dissemination Each step in the metastatic cascade is highly inefficient. Only a small fraction of cells from a primary tumor enter the circulation, and less than 0.01% of these develop into metastases (Gupta et al., 2005Gupta P.B. Mani S. Yang J. Hartwell K. Weinberg R.A. The evolving portrait of cancer metastasis.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is thought that tumor cells pass through several stages during which they sequentially acquire the ability to invade through basement membrane(s), enter and exit the bloodstream, and survive and grow in distant organs. Because each of these events is rare, studies of the metastatic process have relied heavily upon cells that have been cultured and manipulated in vitro and reintroduced into recipient animals. As a result, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the factors that influence each stage in vivo as well as the timing of dissemination itself. Clinical observations, mainly in the field of breast cancer, have given rise to two major metastasis paradigms. The classical model treats metastasis as the final step in a progressive “Darwinian” sequence, in which tumors acquire mutations that promote invasive behavior and dissemination late in tumor evolution (Cairns, 1975Cairns J. Mutation selection and the natural history of cancer.Nature. 1975; 255: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). This model has several conceptual problems (Gupta et al., 2005Gupta P.B.

Cancer. 2009; 9: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and fails to account for two clinical observations: the appearance of metastatic lesions years after resection of small tumors with no clinically evident metastases at diagnosis (Pantel et al., 2008Pantel K. Brakenhoff R.H. Brandt B. Detection, clinical relevance and specific biological properties of disseminating tumour cells.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and metastases of unknown primary tumors, which account for as many as 4%–5% of all clinical metastases (Greco and Hainsworth, 2009Greco F.A. Hainsworth J.D. Introduction: unknown primary cancer.Semin. Oncol. 2009; 36: 6-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An alternative model has been proposed that envisions metastasis as an inherent feature of a tumor very early in its natural history (Hellman, 1994Hellman S. Karnofsky Memorial Lecture. Natural history of small breast cancers.J. Clin. Oncol. 1994; 12: 2229-2234PubMed Google Scholar, Klein, 2009Klein C.A. Parallel progression of primary tumours and metastases.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 302-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Although direct evidence for this model is limited, recent studies of breast cancer are consistent with the notion that metastatic seeding may be mediated by cells that would not meet a standard definition of cancer (Hüsemann et al., 2008Hüsemann Y. Geigl J.B. Schubert F. Musiani P. Meyer M. Burghart E. Forni G. Eils R. Fehm T. Riethmüller G. Klein C.A.

Furthermore, several small studies concluded that the presence of putative disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients with low-grade mammary tumors or carcinoma in situ correlates with a worse outcome (Ignatiadis et al., 2011Ignatiadis M. Rothé F. Chaboteaux C. Durbecq V. Rouas G. Criscitiello C. Metallo J. Kheddoumi N. Singhal S.K.

Cancer. 2011; 129: 2522-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The possibility that cellular dissemination leading to metastasis occurs prior to the formation of an identifiable primary tumor has significant clinical and biological implications. One of the challenges in studying tumor cell dissemination has been the identification of markers that distinguish cancer cells from cells that normally reside in the bloodstream or at sites of seeding. During malignant progression, it has been proposed that carcinoma cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which they lose epithelial characteristics and acquire invasive properties and stem cell-like features (Polyak and Weinberg, 2009Polyak K. Weinberg R.A. Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states: acquisition of malignant and stem cell traits.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). Although several studies support a physiologic role during tumor progression (Moody et al., 2005Moody S.E. Perez D. Pan T.C. Sarkisian C.J. Portocarrero C.P. Sterner C.J. Notorfrancesco K.L.

Eng C. et al.Direct evidence for epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in breast cancer.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), most studies of EMT in the context of cancer biology have been conducted in vitro, and thus the relevance of EMT to carcinogenesis continues to be debated (Ledford, 2011Ledford H. Cancer theory faces doubts.Nature. 2011; 472: 273Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). If EMT does play a crucial role in cancer cell spread in vivo, then detection methods that rely on cellular expression of epithelial markers alone are likely to provide an incomplete picture of metastasis. To understand the early events that accompany invasive behavior, we developed a lineage-labeling system to detect and isolate cells of pancreatic epithelial origin during stochastic tumor progression. This system allowed us to determine the kinetics of EMT and hematogenous dissemination during the natural evolution of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in vivo and correlate cell phenotype with the acquisition of invasive and tumor-initiating properties. We used a Cre-lox-based mouse model of PDAC to study the fate of pancreatic epithelial cells during various stages of tumor progression (Bardeesy et al., 2006Bardeesy N. Aguirre A.J. Chu G.C. Cheng K.H. Lopez L.V. Hezel A.F. Feng B. Brennan C. Weissleder R. Mahmood U. et al.Both p16(Ink4a) and the p19(Arf)-p53 pathway constrain progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the mouse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5947-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The model relies on the Pdx1-Cre transgenic strain (Gu et al., 2003Gu G. Brown J.R. Melton D.A. Direct lineage tracing reveals the ontogeny of pancreatic cell fates during mouse embryogenesis.Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to generate pancreas-specific mutations in Kras and p53, genes that are mutated with high frequency in human pancreatic cancers (Hezel et al., 2006Hezel A.F. Kimmelman A.C. Stanger B.Z. Bardeesy N. Depinho R.A. Genetics and biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1218-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). In order to track pancreatic epithelial cells during tumor progression, we introduced a RosaYFP allele into the mutant background, resulting in highly specific and efficient (>95%) labeling (Figures 1A and 1B ). Animals containing all four alleles were referred to as PKCY mice. A second model, in which a single allele of p16Ink4a/Arf was deleted in place of p53 (IKCY; Aguirre et al., 2003Aguirre A.J. Bardeesy N. Sinha M. Lopez L. Tuveson D.A. Horner J. Redston M.S. DePinho R.A. Activated Kras and Ink4a/Arf deficiency cooperate to produce metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3112-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), was also employed and yielded similar results (data not shown). The lineage-labeled mouse models displayed similar histology as nonlabeled models, including the development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), primary tumors, and metastases, with reproducible kinetics (Figures 1C–1I). Because the Pdx1 promoter is active only in endoderm-derived pancreatic cells (Gu et al., 2003Gu G. Brown J.R. Melton D.A. Direct lineage tracing reveals the ontogeny of pancreatic cell fates during mouse embryogenesis.Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), only the epithelium was tagged by this method. Importantly, mesenchymal cells were never labeled under control conditions in Pdx1-Cre; RosaYFP (CY) animals (Figures 1J and 1K). Initially, we looked for cancer cells that coexpressed an epithelial marker and a mesenchymal marker, a standard approach used to detect cells at an “intermediate stage” of EMT. In the course of these studies, we used several mesenchymal markers (Figure S1 available online) but focused our analysis on Zeb1 and Fsp1 as these markers serve as independent predictors of mortality in patients with pancreatic cancer (Brabletz et al., 2011Brabletz S. Bajdak K. Meidhof S. Burk U. Niedermann G. Firat E. Wellner U. Dimmler A. Faller G. Schubert J. Brabletz T. The ZEB1/miR-200 feedback loop controls Notch signalling in cancer cells.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 770-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2007Wang F. Sloss C. Zhang X. Lee S.W. Cusack J.C. Membrane-bound heparin-binding epidermal growth factor like growth factor regulates E-cadherin expression in pancreatic carcinoma cells.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8486-8493Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using this method, we detected tumor cells in tumor-bearing mice (“PDAC mice”) that coexpressed either Zeb1 or Fsp1 and the epithelial marker E-cadherin (E-cad; Figure 1O), indicating that such “biphenotypic” cells exist, albeit at a low frequency (<10%). We then used the YFP lineage label to identify PDAC cells that had completed an EMT. Because labeling was limited to cells of epithelial origin, we defined EMT as having occurred if a cell coexpressed YFP and either Zeb1 (Figure 1P) or Fsp1 (Figure S1D) and/or lacked E-cad (Figure 1Q) expression. Using this approach, we observed that 42% of the lineage-labeled YFP+ cells in PKCY tumors had undergone EMT (Figure 1P); higher rates of EMT (68% of all YFP+ cells) were found in the IKCY model (data not shown). EMT was not detected in lineage-labeled CY control mice by either method (Figures 1L–1N). Thus, genetic lineage marking is a sensitive tool for distinguishing cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin and for the detection of EMT. EMT has been proposed to be a prerequisite for invasion and dissemination of carcinoma cells (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar). To determine when EMT first occurs during PanIN-to-carcinoma progression, we analyzed 8- to 10-week-old PKCY mice. At these time points, only precancerous PanIN lesions were present, and there was no histological evidence of PDAC based on extensive H&E analysis (n = 18); these animals were referred to as “PanIN mice” solely to reflect the histological state of the pancreas at these time points. EMT was identified in premalignant lesions from both models (Figures 2B, 2C , S1B, and S1C; data not shown). 2.7% and 6.8% of all PanIN 2 and 3 lesions, respectively, contained at least one YFP+Zeb1+ cell, whereas EMT was never observed in PanIN 1 lesions (Figures 2A and 2E). Similar results were noted with other mesenchymal markers, including Fsp1, Slug, Snail1, and Sip1 (Figure S1). EMT was also prevalent in areas of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), particularly in lesions surrounded by abundant inflammatory cells (Figures 2D and S2A). We refer to these areas as ADMIs (acinar-to-ductal metaplasia with inflammation) and determined that 15.8% of ADMIs had evidence of EMT in 8- to 10-week-old PKCY PanIN mice (Figure 2E). We sorted YFP+ cells and performed qPCR to confirm that epithelium-derived pancreatic cells activated a mesenchymal program at the transcriptional level (Figure 2F). Transcripts for Zeb1, Fsp1, and N-cadherin were found in YFP+ cells from tumor-bearing PKCY animals and PanIN animals but not in YFP+ cells from CY control mice (Figure 2G; p < 0.01). These data indicate that EMT occurs in PanIN lesions and ADMIs prior to tumor formation. Cells that have undergone EMT acquire an invasive phenotype in vitro (Polyak and Weinberg, 2009Polyak K. Weinberg R.A. Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states: acquisition of malignant and stem cell traits.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that cells that undergo EMT in PanIN mice might also have invasive properties. Consistent with this notion, we identified individual YFP+ cells that had traversed the basement membrane and dissociated from any discernible pancreatic epithelial structure (a process we refer to as “delamination”) in mice bearing PanIN 2 and PanIN 3 lesions (Figures 3A and S2A). Most of these cells expressed Zeb1 (Figure 3A, i–iii) and had acquired a fibroblast-like morphology, making them indistinguishable from surrounding stromal cells by conventional histology (Figures 3A, 3B, and S2); a fraction of the delaminated YFP+ cells also expressed Fsp1 (Figure S2A , insets). To rule out the possibility that the Pdx1 promoter might be ectopically activated in mesenchymal cells during premalignant progression, we performed lineage tracing in Mist1CreERT2 mice whose acinar cells had been labeled by tamoxifen pulse. In the setting of experimental pancreatitis (as described in greater detail below), Mist1CreERT2; KrasG12D; RosaYFP pancreata contained fibroblast-like YFP+ cells that lacked E-cad expression (Figure S2B). Because Mist1CreERT2 mediates labeling solely at the time of tamoxifen administration (Habbe et al., 2008Habbe N. Shi G. Meguid R.A. Fendrich V. Esni F. Chen H. Feldmann G. Stoffers D.A. Konieczny S.F. Leach S.D. Maitra A. Spontaneous induction of murine pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPanIN) by acinar cell targeting of oncogenic Kras in adult mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 18913-18918Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), this experiment demonstrates unambiguously that the labeled mesenchymal cells were derived from pancreatic acinar cells in vivo.Figure S2EMT, Delamination, and Dissemination Occur within PanIN Pancreases and Are Concentrated near Regions of ADMIs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Three individual PKCY mice aged 8–10 weeks analyzed by IF (first column), H&E (second column), and FACS to determine CPC concentration (last column).

YFP+E-cad− spindle-shaped cells were found to be dissociated from epithelial structures (arrowhead, inset) and were indistinguishable from surrounding stromal cells (H&E). YFP was stained with rabbit α GFP antibody (Invitrogen; “YFP(r)”). To extend these studies, we performed immunostaining for the Pdx1 transcription factor. Pdx1 is normally expressed at high levels during pancreatic development and in adult β cells, and it is commonly “reactivated” in human PanIN lesions and in PDAC (Park et al., 2011Park J.Y. Hong S.M. Klimstra D.S. Goggins M.G. Maitra A. Hruban R.H. Pdx1 expression in pancreatic precursor lesions and neoplasms.Appl. Immunohistochem. Mol. Morphol. 2011; 19: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Pdx1 was widely expressed in PanIN lesions and in a subset of YFP+ cells that had delaminated in PanIN mice (Figure S3A ). Consistent with these data, sections of human pancreas that contained PanIN lesions (but no tumor) exhibited scattered Pdx1+ cells that were separated from any defined epithelial structure (Figures S3B–S3D). Thus, human pancreatic cells may delaminate from PanIN lesions as they do in the mouse model. Because lineage tracing demonstrated that pancreatic cells can cross the basement membrane before invasive behavior is detectable by standard histology, we asked whether these cells could also enter the bloodstream prior to tumor formation. In tumor-bearing PDAC mice, YFP+ circulating pancreatic cells (CPCs) were readily detected in the blood by flow cytometry (Figure 3E). Surprisingly, CPCs were also abundant in the bloodstream of 8- to 10-week-old PKCY PanIN mice (Figures 3C–3G). Sorted YFP+ cells contained the recombined YFP allele (Figure 3H), expressed transcripts for YFP, Pdx1, and E-cad (Figure 3I), and carried the Gly→Asp mutation at codon 12 of the Kras cDNA (Figures 3J and 3K). Thus, cells derived from the pancreatic epithelium are present in the circulation of mice with no evidence of carcinoma. These data raised the possibility that CPCs from PanIN mice might seed distant organs. To assess this possibility, we first examined PDAC mice as a positive control. Bright-field stereomicroscopy permitted detection of peritoneal, liver, or lung metastases in 8/20 animals; use of the YFP lineage label enhanced detection, revealing micrometastases in 16/20 PDAC mice (Figure 3L). Next, we analyzed 8- to 10-week-old PKCY PanIN mice. Although no animals had macro- or micrometastases, liver seeding by YFP+ cells was detected in 4/11 PanIN mice (Figures 3M and 3N); most were single cells located near blood vessels and expressed neither Zeb1 nor E-cad (Figures 3M and 3N). By contrast, 0/10 livers from lineage-labeled control CY mice harbored YFP+ cells when examined by the same technique. The number of YFP+ CPCs from PDAC mice depended on the location of blood collection, with a roughly 3-fold increase in abundance in the right side of the heart compared to the left side (Figure 4A ). Only 2/9 PDAC mice had evidence of lung metastases, suggesting that the vast majority of CPCs do not survive passage through the pulmonary circulation. To determine whether cells in the circulation exhibited an epithelial, mesenchymal, or mixed phenotype, we stained CPCs with a variety of markers in a flow cytometric assay. The epithelial markers E-cad, CK19, and EpCAM were detected in fewer than 20% of PanIN CPCs and fewer than 40% of PDAC CPCs (Figure 4B). With the exception of Fsp1—which was detected in only 1.1% of all PanIN CPCs compared to 45.2% in PDAC CPCs (p < 0.01)—there were no statistically significant differences in cell-surface phenotype between CPCs from the two groups (Figure 4B). Coimmunofluorescence for Zeb1 and EpCAM revealed that approximately 40% of PDAC CPCs were Zeb1+, 27% were EpCAM+, and 18% were double positive (Figure S4), suggesting that most CPCs do not exhibit a “mixed” epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype. These data indicate that CPCs from PDAC and PanIN animals are phenotypically similar and that a large fraction maintains a mesenchymal phenotype in the circulation.Figure S4Expression of EpCAM and Zeb1 in CTCs and Characterization of CPCs from Cerulein-Treated KCY Mice, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Representative two-dimensional analysis of CTC from PKCY mice (n = 3).

Cancer stem cells are functionally defined as cells that have enhanced tumor-initiating capacity upon transplantation into a permissive host. In human pancreatic tumors, this activity may be contained within a CD24+CD44+ population of cells, among others (Hermann et al., 2007Hermann P.C. Huber S.L. Herrler T. Aicher A. Ellwart J.W. Guba M.

Because EMT in primary cells has been associated with the acquisition of stem cell-like characteristics (Mani et al., 2008Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A. Zhou A.Y. Brooks M.

Shipitsin M. et al.The epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates cells with properties of stem cells.Cell. 2008; 133: 704-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6750) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that CPCs might also exhibit features of cancer stem cells. We compared the relative abundance of CD24+CD44+ cells in pancreata and CPCs from PanIN and PDAC mice. By fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, 0.11% ± 0.32% and 0.30% ± 0.13% of sorted YFP+ cells from PanIN and PDAC pancreata, respectively, expressed both CD24 and CD44 (Figure 4C). By contrast, 23.1% ± 12.9% and 46.4% ± 14.7% of sorted YFP+ CPCs from PanIN and PDAC samples were found to be CD24+CD44+, representing a greater than 100-fold enrichment when compared to the source pancreas (Figure 4D). We next assessed the survival and self-renewal properties of CPCs directly by employing an in vitro pancreatosphere assay, in which single YFP+ cells were cultured in attachment-free conditions (Rovira et al., 2010Rovira M. Scott S.G. Liss A.S. Jensen J. Thayer S.P. Leach S.D. Isolation and characterization of centroacinar/terminal ductal progenitor cells in adult mouse pancreas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In both PanIN and PDAC mice, YFP+ CPCs had significantly greater rates of clonal survival and growth compared to YFP+ pancreas cells from the same animal (Figures 4E and 4F; p < 0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that during tumor evolution in vivo, bloodstream entry is associated with enrichment of cells that have phenotypic and functional features associated with pancreatic cancer stem cells.

https://openalex.org/W2056482755,"Chromosomes are the physical realization of genetic information and thus form the basis for its readout and propagation. Here we present a high-resolution chromosomal contact map derived from a modified genome-wide chromosome conformation capture approach applied to Drosophila embryonic nuclei. The data show that the entire genome is linearly partitioned into well-demarcated physical domains that overlap extensively with active and repressive epigenetic marks. Chromosomal contacts are hierarchically organized between domains. Global modeling of contact density and clustering of domains show that inactive domains are condensed and confined to their chromosomal territories, whereas active domains reach out of the territory to form remote intra- and interchromosomal contacts. Moreover, we systematically identify specific long-range intrachromosomal contacts between Polycomb-repressed domains.

https://openalex.org/W1965949446,"Genetic analysis of agronomic traits in crops is complicated by the long generation times and challenges of growing and phenotyping plants in large field trials. Abe et al. show how whole genome resequencing can be used to identify the genetic basis of subtle phenotypic traits in rice. The majority of agronomic traits are controlled by multiple genes that cause minor phenotypic effects, making the identification of these genes difficult. Here we introduce MutMap, a method based on whole-genome resequencing of pooled DNA from a segregating population of plants that show a useful phenotype. In MutMap, a mutant is crossed directly to the original wild-type line and then selfed, allowing unequivocal segregation in second filial generation (F2) progeny of subtle phenotypic differences. This approach is particularly amenable to crop species because it minimizes the number of genetic crosses (n = 1 or 0) and mutant F2 progeny that are required. We applied MutMap to seven mutants of a Japanese elite rice cultivar and identified the unique genomic positions most probable to harbor mutations causing pale green leaves and semidwarfism, an agronomically relevant trait. These results show that MutMap can accelerate the genetic improvement of rice and other crop plants."

https://openalex.org/W2150144117,"p53 is a frequent target for mutation in human tumors, and mutant p53 proteins can actively contribute to tumorigenesis. We employed a three-dimensional culture model in which nonmalignant breast epithelial cells form spheroids reminiscent of acinar structures found in vivo, whereas breast cancer cells display highly disorganized morphology. We found that mutant p53 depletion is sufficient to phenotypically revert breast cancer cells to a more acinar-like morphology. Genome-wide expression analysis identified the mevalonate pathway as significantly upregulated by mutant p53. Statins and sterol biosynthesis intermediates reveal that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the phenotypic effects of mutant p53 on breast tissue architecture. Mutant p53 associates with sterol gene promoters at least partly via SREBP transcription factors. Finally, p53 mutation correlates with highly expressed sterol biosynthesis genes in human breast tumors. These findings implicate the mevalonate pathway as a therapeutic target for tumors bearing mutations in p53."
https://openalex.org/W2000448320,"Exome sequencing identifies mutations in kelch-like 3 and cullin 3 as causes of a syndrome featuring high blood pressure and electrolyte abnormalities. Exome sequencing in a family with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, a rare Mendelian syndrome featuring hypertension, has identified mutations in kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) and cullin 3 (CUL3). This implicates a specific ubiquitin ligase pathway in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. This study also demonstrates the value of exome sequencing — a cheaper alternative to whole genome sequencing — in the identification of disease-associated genes. Hypertension affects one billion people and is a principal reversible risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), a rare Mendelian syndrome featuring hypertension, hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis, has revealed previously unrecognized physiology orchestrating the balance between renal salt reabsorption and K+ and H+ excretion1. Here we used exome sequencing to identify mutations in kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) or cullin 3 (CUL3) in PHAII patients from 41 unrelated families. KLHL3 mutations are either recessive or dominant, whereas CUL3 mutations are dominant and predominantly de novo. CUL3 and BTB-domain-containing kelch proteins such as KLHL3 are components of cullin–RING E3 ligase complexes that ubiquitinate substrates bound to kelch propeller domains2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Dominant KLHL3 mutations are clustered in short segments within the kelch propeller and BTB domains implicated in substrate9 and cullin5 binding, respectively. Diverse CUL3 mutations all result in skipping of exon 9, producing an in-frame deletion. Because dominant KLHL3 and CUL3 mutations both phenocopy recessive loss-of-function KLHL3 mutations, they may abrogate ubiquitination of KLHL3 substrates. Disease features are reversed by thiazide diuretics, which inhibit the Na–Cl cotransporter in the distal nephron of the kidney; KLHL3 and CUL3 are expressed in this location, suggesting a mechanistic link between KLHL3 and CUL3 mutations, increased Na–Cl reabsorption, and disease pathogenesis. These findings demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing in disease gene identification despite the combined complexities of locus heterogeneity, mixed models of transmission and frequent de novo mutation, and establish a fundamental role for KLHL3 and CUL3 in blood pressure, K+ and pH homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2062594525,"Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated cation channels derived from algae that have shown experimental utility in optogenetics; for example, neurons expressing ChRs can be optically controlled with high temporal precision within systems as complex as freely moving mammals. Although ChRs have been broadly applied to neuroscience research, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which these unusual and powerful proteins operate. Here we present the crystal structure of a ChR (a C1C2 chimaera between ChR1 and ChR2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) at 2.3 Å resolution. The structure reveals the essential molecular architecture of ChRs, including the retinal-binding pocket and cation conduction pathway. This integration of structural and electrophysiological analyses provides insight into the molecular basis for the remarkable function of ChRs, and paves the way for the precise and principled design of ChR variants with novel properties."
https://openalex.org/W2157103346,"Secreted signals, known as morphogens, provide the positional information that organizes gene expression and cellular differentiation in many developing tissues. In the vertebrate neural tube, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) acts as a morphogen to control the pattern of neuronal subtype specification. Using an in vivo reporter of Shh signaling, mouse genetics, and systems modeling, we show that a spatially and temporally changing gradient of Shh signaling is interpreted by the regulatory logic of a downstream transcriptional network. The design of the network, which links three transcription factors to Shh signaling, is responsible for differential spatial and temporal gene expression. In addition, the network renders cells insensitive to fluctuations in signaling and confers hysteresis--memory of the signal. Our findings reveal that morphogen interpretation is an emergent property of the architecture of a transcriptional network that provides robustness and reliability to tissue patterning."

We investigated pancreatic cancer progression by utilizing a mathematical framework of metastasis formation together with comprehensive data of 228 patients, 101 of whom had autopsies. We found that pancreatic cancer growth is initially exponential. After estimating the rates of pancreatic cancer growth and dissemination, we determined that patients likely harbor metastases at diagnosis and predicted the number and size distribution of metastases as well as patient survival. These findings were validated in an independent database. Finally, we analyzed the effects of different treatment modalities, finding that therapies that efficiently reduce the growth rate of cells earlier in the course of treatment appear to be superior to upfront tumor resection. These predictions can be validated in the clinic. Our interdisciplinary approach provides insights into the dynamics of pancreatic cancer metastasis and identifies optimum therapeutic interventions.

A mathematical framework models pancreatic cancer progression The model allows characterization of growth and dissemination kinetics Treatment strategies to maximize patient survival are identified Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death and one of the most aggressive malignancies in humans, with a five-year relative survival rate of only 5% (Jemal et al., 2010Jemal A. Siegel R. Xu J. Ward E. Cancer statistics, 2010.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2010; 60: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12067) Google Scholar). Pancreatic cancer often develops without early symptoms, and therefore most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease. Treatment options including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy can prolong survival and/or relieve symptoms in many patients, but rarely lead to a cure (Hidalgo, 2010Hidalgo M. Pancreatic cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 1605-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, Stathis and Moore, 2010Stathis A. Moore M.J. Advanced pancreatic carcinoma: current treatment and future challenges.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 7: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Until recently, it was unknown if the poor survival of pancreatic cancer patients was due to a delay in diagnosis or to early metastatic dissemination during the clonal evolution of pancreatic cancer. However, by applying high-throughput genetic analyses to paired primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer tissues, recent findings indicate that up to seven years are required for the development of metastatic subclones within a primary carcinoma after it has formed, and an additional 2–3 years for these clones to disseminate and cause patient death. These findings support the notion that metastasis is a late event in the clonal evolution of this disease (Campbell et al., 2010Campbell P.J. Yachida S. Mudie L.J. Stephens P.J. Pleasance E.D. Stebbings L.A. Morsberger L.A. Latimer C. McLaren S.

In this regard, the growth dynamics of pancreatic cancer follows a linear progression paradigm similar to that described for other tumor types, and thus is a useful model system for understanding the dynamics of metastasis formation in general. The genetic features of pancreatic cancer have been explored in detail and indicate that telomeric shortening and activating mutations in KRAS are among the earliest and most pervasive alterations in pancreatic carcinogenesis (Hruban et al., 2000Hruban R.H. Goggins M. Parsons J. Kern S.E. Progression model for pancreatic cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2969-2972PubMed Google Scholar, Iacobuzio-Donahue, 2011Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A.

J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1541-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These alterations are followed by inactivating mutations in the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene in the mid-stage, and in the TP53 and SMAD4 tumor suppressor genes in the late stage of carcinogenesis (Iacobuzio-Donahue, 2011Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A.

Mutations in a variety of other genes such as BRCA2, MLL3, TGFBR1/II and MKK4 may also occur, albeit at a much lower frequency (Iacobuzio-Donahue, 2011Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A.

Jimeno A. et al.Core signaling pathways in human pancreatic cancers revealed by global genomic analyses.Science. 2008; 321: 1801-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the temporal sequence of these alterations further indicates that the majority, if not all, can be classified as founder mutations, i.e., those mutations present in the clonal population of cells within an intraductal precursor lesion that founded the infiltrating carcinoma (Yachida et al., 2010Yachida S. Jones S. Bozic I. Antal T. Leary R. Fu B. Kamiyama M. Hruban R.H. Eshleman J.R. Nowak M.A. et al.Distant metastasis occurs late during the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer.Nature. 2010; 467: 1114-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). Indeed, the vast majority of deleterious mutations and rearrangements in pancreatic cancer are now known to occur during intraductal carcinogenesis (Campbell et al., 2010Campbell P.J. Yachida S.

While less well understood, epigenetic alterations may also occur during carcinogenesis, leading to changes in gene expression of a variety of biomarkers (Sato and Goggins, 2006Sato N. Goggins M. The role of epigenetic alterations in pancreatic cancer.J. Hepatobiliary Pancreat. Surg. 2006; 13: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Beyond carcinogenesis, the molecular mechanisms that promote the metastatic spread of pancreatic cancer are less clear. The fact that the vast majority of disseminated pancreatic cancer cells do not form metastases (Nguyen et al., 2009Nguyen D.X. Bos P.D. Massague J. Metastasis: from dissemination to organ-specific colonization.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), and that a subset of patients have no observable pancreatic metastases post-mortem despite similar clinicopathologic features as patients who do develop metastatic failure (Iacobuzio-Donahue et al., 2009Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A. Fu B. Yachida S. Luo M. Abe H. Henderson C.M. Vilardell F. Wang Z. Keller J.W.

Oncol. 2009; 27: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), indicates that the development of metastatic disease requires the acquisition of one or more (epi)genetic events that may promote survival of disseminated cells within the circulation and/or target organ sites (Cameron et al., 2000Cameron M.D. Schmidt E.E.

Whether this (epi)genetic event occurs during intraductal carcinogenesis or during clonal evolution beyond formation of the carcinoma is uncertain. However, a study of the patterns of failure in patients with pancreatic cancer indicated that genetic inactivation of SMAD4 during carcinogenesis, and hence dysregulation of canonical TGFß signaling, is highly correlated with subsequent distant metastatic failure (Iacobuzio-Donahue et al., 2009Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A. Fu B. Yachida S. Luo M. Abe H. Henderson C.M. Vilardell F. Wang Z. Keller J.W.

Oncol. 2009; 27: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that loss of SMAD4 during pancreatic carcinogenesis represents a major and perhaps initial pro-metastatic event for this tumor type, upon which subsequent events are superimposed (Iacobuzio-Donahue et al., 2009Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A. Fu B. Yachida S. Luo M. Abe H. Henderson C.M. Vilardell F. Wang Z. Keller J.W.

Oncol. 2009; 27: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In addition to studies addressing the mechanisms by which pancreatic cancers gain metastatic ability, there is the need to understand the growth dynamics of pancreatic cancer and its metastases in association with systemic treatments. This is critical to know because, until early detection of pancreatic cancer becomes routine, most patients will likely continue to be diagnosed with advanced disease (Hidalgo, 2010Hidalgo M. Pancreatic cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 1605-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, Stathis and Moore, 2010Stathis A. Moore M.J. Advanced pancreatic carcinoma: current treatment and future challenges.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 7: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). For this reason, high quality datasets derived from rapid autopsy participants allow an unprecedented documentation of metastatic burden from the time of diagnosis to death (Embuscado et al., 2005Embuscado E.E.

Here we utilize one of these highly unique patient datasets derived from a rapid autopsy program for patients with pancreatic cancer, together with a mathematical framework of pancreatic metastasis development, to understand the growth dynamics of cancer metastasis in the setting of commonly used anti-cancer therapies. This model is subsequently validated using a uniform cohort of patients who underwent curative resection of their pancreatic cancer followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Our approach is then used to identify optimum therapeutic interventions, which can be tested in the clinic.

Dates of diagnoses ranged from May, 1995 to November, 2010. For each patient, data on the primary tumor size and metastatic burden at diagnosis and at autopsy were recorded (Figure 1A ). In addition, at least one intermediate evaluation of the primary tumor, local and distant recurrence as well as metastases was available. Many patients had numerous metastatic tumors at the time of autopsy, and the metastatic burden was categorized into one of three classes: <10 metastases, 10–99 metastases, and >100 metastases.Table 1Summary of the Patient CohortsAutopsy CohortAdjuvant CohortTotal number of patients101127Age∗64 (55-71)61 (56-68)Resected26 (26%)127 (100%)Received adjuvant therapyYes18 (18%)127 (100%)No12 (12%)0 (0%)N/A67 (67%)0 (0%)Unknown4 (4%)0 (0%)Received neoadjuvant therapyYes2 (2%)0 (0%)No30 (30%)127 (100%)N/A65 (65%)0 (0%)Unknown1 (1%)0 (0%)Node-positiveUnknown106 (85%)Margin-positiveUnknown50 (39%)Stage I-III70 (69%)127 (100%)Stage IV31 (31%)0 (0%)Tumor size at diagnosis∗3.7 (2.8-4.2)3 (2.5-4)Progression-free survival∗8.4 (4.6 - 17.7)12.8 (8.4 - 25.4)Survival∗11.4 (6.1 - 24.4)21.0 (13.2-46.4)See also Table S1.

Asterisk indicates that values are shown as median (first and third quartiles). The median age at diagnosis of these 101 patients was 64 (first and third quartiles: 55 and 71). The median size of the primary tumor was 3.7 cm (first and third quartiles: 2.8 and 4.2). Sixty-one patients (60%) had no evidence of metastases at diagnosis. The median size of the largest metastatic tumor in patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis was 2 cm (first and third quartiles: 1.2 and 3.0). The primary tumor was surgically removed in 26 patients (26%). At autopsy, nine patients (9%) did not have a detectable primary tumor and for those who had a detectable primary tumor at autopsy, the median size was 4.8 cm (first and third quartiles: 4 and 6). Fourteen patients (14%) had no metastatic deposits at autopsy, 19 (19%) had <10, 30 (30%) had 10–99, and 38 (37%) had >100 metastatic tumors. The diameters of largest metastases ranged from 0.5 to 14 cm with a median of 2.7 cm (first and third quartiles: 2 and 4). The median survival was significantly different (p value < 0.0001) between those who underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor (24.5, first and third quartiles: 14.8 and 34.7 months, n = 26) and those who did not (8.4, first and third quartiles: 4.5 and 16.8 months, n = 75). Using the 47 patients who had at least one intermediate time point between diagnosis and autopsy, we compared the fit of linear and exponential growth models of primary and metastatic tumors. The exponential model had a better fit than the linear model in 71% of the cases, with a median R2 of 0.63 (0.24–0.88). Other growth models such as a logistic model did not converge for most patients, due to sparsity of the data. The second database from Johns Hopkins Hospital contained information on 127 pancreatic cancer patients who received curative surgical resection between January, 1994 and December, 2008; this database is referred to as the “adjuvant cohort” (Table 1). The median age was 61 (first and third quartiles: 56–68) and 51 (41%) of the patients were women. At the time of analysis, 89 (71%) patients were dead. The size of the primary tumor at the time of surgical resection ranged from 0.7 cm–9.5 cm with a median of 3 cm (first and third quartiles: 2.5 and 4). Fifty (39%) of the primary tumors were poorly differentiated and seventy-seven (61%) had margin-negative resections. Fifty (39%) of the tumors had vascular invasion and 98 (78%) had perineural invasion. All patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy and had complete follow-up and available data on patterns of failure. A majority (84%) received 5-FU based chemoradiation while gemcitabine (16%) was also used as the backbone for chemoradiation. The median follow-up was 78 months and median overall survival was 21.0 months. Thirty-one developed a local recurrence in the tumor bed while 64 developed distant metastases as a site of first failure. Patterns of failure (local, regional, and distant) and burden (quantitative) of disease were recorded until death. We designed a mathematical model of pancreatic cancer progression and dissemination to investigate the dynamics of cancer cell growth and metastasis, the survival of patients, and optimum intervention strategies. The model considers exponential expansion of pancreatic cancer cells starting from a single cell that has not yet evolved the ability to metastasize; this cell might, however, already have accumulated all necessary (epi)genetic alterations for proliferation. We chose an exponential model over other functional forms since the exponential model provided a better fit to the data as compared to a linear model (R2 of 0.63, see above) and does not require as many data points to be reliably fit as some of the more complex models. In the context of our mathematical model, the cells follow a stochastic process: during each elementary time step, a cell is chosen proportional to fitness for reproduction, death, or export from the primary tumor to establish a metastatic colony elsewhere. Time is measured in numbers of cell divisions. Cells that have not yet evolved the ability to metastasize are called type-0 cells (Figure 1B). These cells divide at rate r and die at rate d per time unit. Initially, we consider metastatic ability to be a consequence of a single genetic or epigenetic change, for example the genetic inactivation of SMAD4 (Hahn et al., 1996Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T.

Such an (epi)genetic alteration occurs with probability u per cell division. Cells carrying the alteration are called type-1 cells. These cells divide at rate a1 and die at rate b1 per time unit. Once a type-1 cell has been produced, it has a certain probability of being exported from the primary tumor to attempt the establishment of metastases elsewhere. The integrated rate of leaving the primary site and founding a new colony at a distant site is denoted by q (Figure 1B). Mutation and dissemination are unlikely to occur at the same time but instead are likely separated in time. The relative fitness of type-1 cells as compared to type-0 cells is given by α1=(a1−b1−q)/(r−d) since an increased rate of export, q, contributes to the loss of cells from the primary tumor and hence leads to a selective disadvantage of type-1 cells in that environment. If α1=1, then the fitness of type-1 cells is neutral as compared to that of type-0 cells and the metastasis-enabling mutation does not confer an advantage or disadvantage to the cell in the primary tumor. If α1>1 – either through an increased growth rate or a decreased death rate of type-1 cells, then these cells have a fitness advantage; and if α1<1 – either through a decreased growth rate, an increased death rate or a sufficiently large rate of export of type-1 cells, then they have a fitness disadvantage as compared to type-0 cells in the primary tumor. Once a type-1 cell has migrated to a distant site, it initiates exponential growth with division rate a2 and death rate b2 per time unit. The relative fitness of type-2 cells as compared to type-1 cells is given by α2=(a2−b2)/(a1−b1−q). Again, if α2=1, then the fitness of type-2 cells is neutral, if α2>1, it is advantageous, and if α2<1, it is disadvantageous as compared to the fitness of type-1 cells in the primary tumor. The total number of tumor cells (including all three types) at diagnosis is denoted by M1, and the total number of tumor cells at autopsy is given by M2. Here, diagnosis refers to the initial detection of the tumor when the patient is first admitted to the hospital, and autopsy refers to the time of patient death when the tumor burden is assessed and the cause of death is determined. We expect that all three cell types contribute to the size at diagnosis since in rare cases, metastatic disease with unknown primary is diagnosed, where only type-2 cells can be detected (Ayoub et al., 1998Ayoub J.P. Hess K.R. Abbruzzese M.C. Lenzi R. Raber M.N. Abbruzzese J.L. Unknown primary tumors metastatic to liver.J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 2105-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Once the tumor has been diagnosed with a population size of M1, there are four options in the mathematical framework, which in the clinic depend on a host of other factors such as patient age and co-morbidities: (1) there may be no treatment; (2) the patient may receive surgery, which removes a fraction ε of the primary tumor; (3) the patient may undergo chemotherapy or chemoradiation, which reduces the growth rate of all cells by a factor of γ; or (4) the patient may receive surgery and chemotherapy or chemoradiation. This stochastic mathematical model serves to investigate the probability that metastases are present within a patient at a particular time during tumorigenesis, the total number of cancer cells, the effect of chemotherapy or chemoradiation and resection on these quantities, and the surviva"

As prostate cancer cells proliferate in response to androgen steroids, CYP17A1 inhibition is a new strategy to prevent androgen synthesis and treat lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, but drug development has been hampered by lack of information regarding the structure of CYP17A1. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of CYP17A1, which were obtained in the presence of either abiraterone, a first-in-class steroidal inhibitor recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for late-stage prostate cancer, or TOK-001, an inhibitor that is currently undergoing clinical trials. Both of these inhibitors bind the haem iron, forming a 60° angle above the haem plane and packing against the central I helix with the 3β-OH interacting with aspargine 202 in the F helix. Notably, this binding mode differs substantially from those that are predicted by homology models and from steroids in other cytochrome P450 enzymes with known structures, and some features of this binding mode are more similar to steroid receptors. Whereas the overall structure of CYP17A1 provides a rationale for understanding many mutations that are found in patients with steroidogenic diseases, the active site reveals multiple steric and hydrogen bonding features that will facilitate a better understanding of the enzyme's dual hydroxylase and lyase catalytic capabilities and assist in rational drug design. Specifically, structure-based design is expected to aid development of inhibitors that bind only CYP17A1 and solely inhibit its androgen-generating lyase activity to improve treatment of prostate and other hormone-responsive cancers."

De novo enzyme design has generated catalysts for several reactions, but with lower catalytic efficiencies than naturally occurring enzymes. Here we report the use of game-driven crowdsourcing to enhance the activity of a computationally designed enzyme through the functional remodeling of its structure. Players of the online game Foldit were challenged to remodel the backbone of a computationally designed bimolecular Diels-Alderase to enable additional interactions with substrates. Several iterations of design and characterization generated a 24-residue helix-turn-helix motif, including a 13-residue insertion, that increased enzyme activity >18-fold. X-ray crystallography showed that the large insertion adopts a helix-turn-helix structure positioned as in the Foldit model. These results demonstrate that human creativity can extend beyond the macroscopic challenges encountered in everyday life to molecular-scale design problems."
https://openalex.org/W1995827114,"Vesicular structures called microvesicles (MVs) that are shed from the surfaces of cancer cells are capable of transferring oncogenic cargo to recipient cancer cells, as well as to normal cells, sending mitogenic signals that greatly enhance tumor growth. Because MVs are stable in the circulation, they also may have a key role in secondary colonization and metastasis. Thus, understanding how MVs are generated could have important consequences for interfering with cancer progression. Here we report that the small GTPase RhoA triggers a specific signaling pathway essential for MV biogenesis in various human cancer cells. Inhibiting the activity of different proteins comprising this pathway blocks MV biogenesis in the donor cancer cells and prevents oncogenic transformation in cell culture as well as tumor growth in mice. Although RhoA has often been implicated in human cancer, these findings now highlight a previously unappreciated role for this GTPase in malignant transformation, and demonstrate that blocking MV biogenesis may offer novel approaches for interfering with malignant transformation."

Consistent with the observation of shortened telomeres in an Arabidopsis CTC1 mutant and the phenotypic overlap of Coats plus with the telomeric maintenance disorders comprising dyskeratosis congenita, we observed shortened telomeres in three individuals with Coats plus and an increase in spontaneous γH2AX-positive cells in cell lines derived from two affected individuals. CTC1 is also a subunit of the α-accessory factor (AAF) complex, stimulating the activity of DNA polymerase-α primase, the only enzyme known to initiate DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Thus, CTC1 may have a function in DNA metabolism that is necessary for but not specific to telomeric integrity."

In Fmr1(-/y) mice, mGluR5 was less associated with long Homer isoforms but more associated with the short Homer1a. Genetic deletion of Homer1a restored mGluR5-long Homer scaffolds and corrected several phenotypes in Fmr1(-/y) mice, including altered mGluR5 signaling, neocortical circuit dysfunction and behavior. Acute, peptide-mediated disruption of mGluR5-Homer scaffolds in wild-type mice mimicked many Fmr1(-/y) phenotypes. In contrast, Homer1a deletion did not rescue altered mGluR-dependent long-term synaptic depression or translational control of target mRNAs of fragile X mental retardation protein, the gene product of Fmr1. Our findings reveal new functions for mGluR5-Homer interactions in the brain and delineate distinct mechanisms of mGluR5 dysfunction in a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction and autism."

https://openalex.org/W2136002979,"Extended longevity is often correlated with increased resistance against various stressors. Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) is known to have a conserved role in aging and cellular mechanisms against stress. In C. elegans, genetic studies suggest that heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 is required for IIS to modulate longevity. Here, we report that the activity of HSF-1 is regulated by IIS. This regulation occurs at an early step of HSF-1 activation via two HSF-1 regulators, DDL-1 and DDL-2. Inhibition of DDL-1/2 increases longevity and thermotolerance in an hsf-1-dependent manner. Furthermore, biochemical analyses suggest that DDL-1/2 negatively regulate HSF-1 activity by forming a protein complex with HSF-1. The formation of this complex (DHIC) is affected by the phosphorylation status of DDL-1. Both the formation of DHIC and the phosphorylation of DDL-1 are controlled by IIS. Our findings point to DDL-1/2 as a link between IIS and the HSF-1 pathway. Extended longevity is often correlated with increased resistance against various stressors.

C. elegans DAF-2 insulin-like signaling negatively regulates HSF-1 activity DDL-1 and DDL-2 are negative regulators of HSF-1 Formation of a complex containing DDL-1/2 and HSF-1 inhibits HSF-1 activity DAF-2 signaling promotes DHIC formation by inhibiting DDL-1 phosphorylation Studies in a variety of organisms have revealed that extended longevity is often correlated with increased resistance against the deleterious effects of environmental and physiological stresses, including heat-shock and oxidizing conditions (Lithgow and Walker, 2002Lithgow G.J. Walker G.A. Stress resistance as a determinate of C. elegans lifespan.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the nematode C. elegans, alterations in a number of independent pathways, including the insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathway, are known to increase longevity and stress resistance (Kenyon, 2010Kenyon C.J. The genetics of ageing.Nature. 2010; 464: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). For example, loss-of-function mutations affecting the insulin/IGF-1-like receptor DAF-2 have been shown to increase longevity and resistance to heat stress (Kenyon et al., 1993Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudner A. Tabtiang R. A C. elegans mutant that lives twice as long as wild type.Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar, Lithgow et al., 1995Lithgow G.J.

USA. 1995; 92: 7540-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The IIS pathway also regulates other physiological processes independent of longevity in worms, such as fat production, reproduction, and dauer formation (Kimura et al., 1997Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. daf-2, an insulin receptor-like gene that regulates longevity and diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). The FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, which is negatively regulated by the IIS pathway, is required for most known phenotypes that are associated with reduced IIS (Kenyon, 2010Kenyon C.J. The genetics of ageing.Nature. 2010; 464: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). DAF-16 controls the expression of a diverse set of downstream antioxidant, metabolic, chaperone, antimicrobial, and other genes that act in a cumulative way to influence longevity and stress response (Murphy et al., 2003Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C. Genes that act downstream of DAF-16 to influence the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2003; 424: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Though many genes controlled by the IIS pathway require DAF-16 for their expression, several coregulators of DAF-16, such as HSF-1, SMK-1, and HCF-1, have recently been found to function collaboratively with DAF-16 to regulate different subsets of target genes independently in response to different environmental stressors (Hsu et al., 2003Hsu A.L.

It appears that, among these coregulators of DAF-16, only HSF-1 is required for IIS to upregulate the transcription of genes involved in the heat-shock response. The heat-shock response is a fundamental and critical cellular defensive mechanism against heat stress that results in the rapid expression of a group of proteins known as heat-shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs function as molecular chaperones, playing a variety of roles, including assisting in protein folding, targeting damaged proteins for degradation, and other responses associated with the protection of cell from damage (Hartl, 1996Hartl F.U. Molecular chaperones in cellular protein folding.Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, Jolly and Morimoto, 2000Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. Role of the heat shock response and molecular chaperones in oncogenesis and cell death.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The induction of the heat-shock response is mediated by heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs). Whereas invertebrate animals such as nematodes typically have only one HSF (Clos et al., 1990Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.B. Wilson S. Lambert K. Wu C. Molecular cloning and expression of a hexameric Drosophila heat shock factor subject to negative regulation.Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Garigan et al., 2002Garigan D.

Genetic analysis of tissue aging in Caenorhabditis elegans: a role for heat-shock factor and bacterial proliferation.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1101-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), four distinct but related HSF isoforms have been found in vertebrates (HSF1∼4) (Pirkkala et al., 2001Pirkkala L. Nykänen P. Sistonen L. Roles of the heat shock transcription factors in regulation of the heat shock response and beyond.FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). In response to stress, HSF acquires DNA binding activity to the heat-shock elements (HSE) located in the promoters of hsp genes, thereby mediating their transcription. The activation of vertebrate HSF1 appears to be a multistep process that includes oligomerization, posttranslational modifications, nuclear localization, and acquisition of DNA binding activity (Sarge et al., 1993Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Activation of heat shock gene transcription by heat shock factor 1 involves oligomerization, acquisition of DNA-binding activity, and nuclear localization and can occur in the absence of stress.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). However, not all of these steps are essential for the activation of HSF in invertebrate species (Sorger et al., 1987Sorger P.K. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Heat shock factor is regulated differently in yeast and HeLa cells.Nature. 1987; 329: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A decrease in the effectiveness of the heat-shock response has been associated with aging and is partly responsible for the age-related increase in mortality (Finkel and Holbrook, 2000Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Oxidants, oxidative stress and the biology of ageing.Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar). This age-related attenuation of the heat-shock response is often related to a decrease in the capacity of cells to produce HSPs (Sóti and Csermely, 2000Sóti C. Csermely P. Molecular chaperones and the aging process.Biogerontology. 2000; 1: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several studies have directly implicated heat-shock response genes, including HSF, in the regulation of longevity. First, it has been reported that the expression of genes encoding small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) is increased in Drosophila lines selected for increased longevity (Kurapati et al., 2000Kurapati R. Passananti H.B. Rose M.R. Tower J. Increased hsp22 RNA levels in Drosophila lines genetically selected for increased longevity.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2000; 55: B552-B559Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as well as in C. elegans daf-2 mutants (Murphy et al., 2003Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C. Genes that act downstream of DAF-16 to influence the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2003; 424: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Moreover, mild heat stress in C. elegans results in a small but significant extension of life span (Lithgow et al., 1995Lithgow G.J. White T.M. Melov S. Johnson T.E. Thermotolerance and extended life-span conferred by single-gene mutations and induced by thermal stress.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 7540-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Similarly, mild heat stress in Drosophila causes a period of decreased mortality rate (Khazaeli et al., 1997Khazaeli A.A. Tatar M. Pletcher S.D. Curtsinger J.W. Heat-induced longevity extension in Drosophila. I. Heat treatment, mortality, and thermotolerance.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1997; 52: B48-B52Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It also has been found that overexpression of hsf-1 leads to increased longevity, whereas inhibition of HSF-1 activity by RNAi shortens the animal's life span (Hsu et al., 2003Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Regulation of aging and age-related disease by DAF-16 and heat-shock factor.Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that HSF-1 and its downstream targets may act in concert with the IIS pathway to regulate longevity in C. elegans. It has been reported that HSF-1, similar to DAF-16, is required for daf-2 mutations to extend life span (Hsu et al., 2003Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Regulation of aging and age-related disease by DAF-16 and heat-shock factor.Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). It is also known that the expression of a subset of heat-shock response genes is increased in daf-2 mutants under unstressed conditions and is at least partially required for the life span phenotypes of daf-2 mutants (Hsu et al., 2003Hsu A.L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Regulation of aging and age-related disease by DAF-16 and heat-shock factor.Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Together, these observations imply that the IIS pathway might, at least in part, influence longevity by regulating heat-shock response. Here, we show that both the DNA binding and the transcriptional activity of HSF-1 are directly regulated by IIS and that this regulation likely occurs at an early step of HSF-1 activation. We show that the proteins DDL-1 and DDL-2, previously implicated in life span extension, modulate HSF-1 activity by forming an inhibitory heterocomplex with HSF-1 and that formation of this complex is regulated by IIS. Our findings suggest that these HSF-1 regulators may link insulin/IGF-1 signaling and the cellular response to heat stress. Heat-shock transcription factor (HSF-1) is a key transcriptional regulator of the cellular response to various proteotoxic stresses, including heat, in C. elegans. The mammalian HSF1 is constitutively present in cells and is activated when cells encounter proteotoxic stresses. It has been well documented in other animal models that activation of HSF1 appears to be a multistep process, involving oligomerization, inducible posttranslational modification, nuclear/subnuclear localization, acquisition of DNA binding activity, and acquisition of transcriptional activity. All of these steps are shown to be tightly controlled (reviewed in Morimoto, 1998Morimoto R.I. Regulation of the heat shock transcriptional response: cross talk between a family of heat shock factors, molecular chaperones, and negative regulators.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, Voellmy, 2004Voellmy R. On mechanisms that control heat shock transcription factor activity in metazoan cells.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2004; 9: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, given the important role that C. elegans HSF-1 might play in determining DAF-2 longevity, the activation and regulation of HSF-1 have not been thoroughly investigated. Thus, we first examined how C. elegans HSF-1 responds to heat stress. To examine whether oligomerization of HSF-1 also occurs in C. elegans, worm whole-cell extracts (WCE) were incubated with crosslinking reagent EGS before being analyzed by western blotting with anti-human HSF1 antibody. We found that worm HSF-1 forms both dimers and trimers upon heat shock (Figure S1A available online). We then asked whether HSF-1 is posttranslationally modified in response to heat shock. Results from our western blotting analysis indicate that posttranslational modifications (PTM) on HSF-1 proteins occur in a time-dependent manner upon heat shock (Figure S1B). This change may represent a shift from a nonmodified to a modified form of HSF-1 or a shift between two different posttranslationally modified forms of HSF-1 in response to heat shock. Further analysis with alkaline phosphatase (CIP) suggests that phosphorylation(s) may be responsible for the majority of the PTM observed in HSF-1 (Figure S1C). There are at least 12 phosphorylation sites, both constitutive and inducible, that have been identified on human HSF1 (Guettouche et al., 2005Guettouche T. Boellmann F. Lane W.S. Voellmy R. Analysis of phosphorylation of human heat shock factor 1 in cells experiencing a stress.BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The effects of phosphorylation on HSF-1 activity, however, can be either positive or negative. One of the most important steps of HSF activation is for HSFs to acquire DNA binding activity to the heat-shock element (HSE), located in the upstream regulatory region of its target genes. Thus, we examined whether heat shock leads to an induction of HSF-1 DNA binding activity in worms, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) developed in our lab for C. elegans HSF-1. As observed in other systems upon stimulation, there is an increased level of HSF-1 that can bind to the biotin-labeled HSE probes (Figure 1A ). This binding can be outcompeted by unlabeled HSE containing oligonucleotides, but not by randomly synthesized oligonucleotides, suggesting a specific interaction between HSF-1 and HSE probes. Moreover, activated HSF-1 and HSE form a larger complex with the anti-HSF1 polyclonal antibodies, but not with the anti-GFP antibodies (Figure 1A). Though the formation of active oligomers to acquire DNA binding activity is conserved across species, there has been some controversy regarding the subcellular localization of HSF1 under unstressed conditions in different metazoan systems. Some studies have suggested that HSF1 is predominantly cytoplasmic prior to heat shock and nuclear after stress (Sarge et al., 1993Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Activation of heat shock gene transcription by heat shock factor 1 involves oligomerization, acquisition of DNA-binding activity, and nuclear localization and can occur in the absence of stress.Mol.

Human heat shock factors 1 and 2 are differentially activated and can synergistically induce hsp70 gene transcription.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2087-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), whereas others have suggested that HSF1 is always nuclear (Mercier et al., 1999Mercier P.A. Winegarden N.A. Westwood J.T. Human heat shock factor 1 is predominantly a nuclear protein before and after heat stress.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a transgenic line that expresses gfp-tagged hsf-1 under the control of its own endogenous promoter, HSF-1-GFP was observed in intestinal cells, body wall muscle cells, and hypodermal cells, as well as many neurons in the head and tail. The GFP signal can be reduced upon treatment with hsf-1 RNAi. The HSF-1-GFP is evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm before heat shock in intestinal cells (Figure 1B). In response to 30 min of heat shock, an accumulation of HSF-1-GFP was observed in the intestinal nuclei (Figure 1B). Overexpression of the same hsf::gfp construct rescued the life span-shortening effect of hsf-1(sy441) mutations (Hajdu-Cronin et al., 2004Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Chen W.J. Sternberg P.W. The L-type cyclin CYL-1 and the heat-shock-factor HSF-1 are required for heat-shock-induced protein expression in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2004; 168: 1937-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Figure S1F) and produced a significant life span extension on its own in a wild-type background (Figure S1G), suggesting that the tagged HSF is fully functional. Together, our findings suggest that the activation of HSF-1 in C. elegans is also a multistep process and that these assays can be very useful tools to assess HSF-1 activity. If insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathway influences longevity, at least in part, by directly modulating HSF-1 activity and heat-shock response, one would expect that a reduction in DAF-2 activity should promote the activation of HSF-1 and raise its activity. To test this idea, we first investigated how reduction in DAF-2 activity affects HSF-1 nuclear translocation and found that there is a significantly higher level of HSF-1 localized in the nucleus of daf-2(RNAi) animals compared to control before or after heat shock (Figure 1B), indicating an elevated HSF-1 activation. This effect appears to be DAF-16 independent, as simultaneous knockdown of both daf-2 and daf-16 did not reverse the phenotype (Figure 1B). Similarly, inactivation of another IIS component AKT-1 by RNAi resulted in an increased HSF-1 nuclear localization, although the effect was smaller (Figure 1B). We next examined how reduction in DAF-2 activity affects the DNA binding activity of HSF-1. As predicted, we found that the DNA binding activity of HSF-1 is increased 4-fold in unstressed daf-2(RNAi) animals and more than 17-fold in heat-shocked daf-2(RNAi) animals as compared to the unstressed wild-type (N2) controls (Figures 1C and 1D), suggesting that the basal level of HSF-1 activity might be higher in daf-2(RNAi) animals, which may allow for a stronger response to heat stress. Presumably, the increase in DNA binding activity of HSF-1 in response to heat stress or daf-2 knockdown may result from a nuclear accumulation of activated HSF-1 (i.e., the oligomerized and posttranslationally modified HSF-1). Indeed, results from western blotting analysis indicate that there is an elevated level of posttranslationally modified HSF-1 in daf-2 mutants under both unstressed and stressed condition (Figures 1E and S1D), suggesting the presence of an increased amount of activated HSF-1 in daf-2 mutants. It is worth noting that the amount of total HSF-1 was also increased in response to heat stress or daf-2 knockdown, whereas the level of unmodified HSF-1 remained largely unaltered (Figure S1D). However, this increase in total HSF-1 protein is unlikely to be regulated transcriptionally, as the mRNA level of hsf-1 does not appear to be different in daf-2(RNAi) animals compared to the control (Figure S3A). In fact, mRNA level of hsf-1 is slightly reduced after heat-shock (Figure S3A), implying a potential negative feedback regulation at the transcriptional level following the initial activation upon heat shock. One possible explanation is that the modified and DNA-bound HSF-1 proteins are less accessible for degradation. Finally, to examine whether increased DNA binding activity of HSF-1 results in an increase in its transcriptional activity, we measured the mRNA level of four known targets of HSF-1 by qRT-PCR in daf-2(RNAi) animals before and after heat stress. The mRNA levels of these genes, including hsp-16.2, sip-1, and two different hsp-70 s, are all increased in daf-2(RNAi) animals under both stressed and unstressed conditions (Figures 1F, 1G, S3C, and S3D). The upregulation of heat-shock protein expression observed in daf-2(RNAi) animals can be suppressed by hsf-1 RNAi treatments (Figures 1F, 1G, S3C, and S3D), suggesting that the observed changes in the expression are the result of alteration in HSF-1 activity. Together, our findings suggest that the HSF-1 activity is negatively controlled by the IIS pathway and that multiple steps of HSF-1 activation are affected by inhibiting IIS under both stressed and unstressed conditions. Our findings, together with previous studies, strongly suggest that HSF-1 activity is regulated by IIS. To further understand this regulation and determine whether it is direct, we next attempted to elucidate the mechanism underlying this regulation. We focused on two daf-16-dependent longevity (ddl) genes identified from a previous genome-wide RNAi screen for longevity genes (Hansen et al., 2005Hansen M. Hsu A.L. Dillin A. Kenyon C. New genes tied to endocrine, metabolic, and dietary regulation of lifespan from a Caenorhabditis elegans genomic RNAi screen.PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). ddl-1 and ddl-2 both encode evolutionarily conserved proteins. DDL-1 is homologous to human coiled-coil domain-containing protein 53 (CCDC53), whereas DDL-2 is the worm homolog of human Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH2) protein. WASH2 and CCDC53 are both components of the WASH complex, which is involved in the actin polymerization (Derivery et al., 2009Derivery E. Sousa C. Gautier J.J. Lombard B. Loew D. Gautreau A. The Arp2/3 activator WASH controls the fission of endosomes through a large multiprotein complex.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 712-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). CCDC53 has also been reported to potentially interact with the heat-shock factor binding protein-1 (HSBP1) (Rual et al., 2005Rual J.F. Venkatesan K. Hao T. Hirozane-Kishikawa T. Dricot A. Li N. Berriz G.F. Gibbons F.D. Dreze M. Ayivi-Guedehoussou N. et al.Towards a proteome-scale map of the human protein-protein interaction network.Nature. 2005; 437: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar), a known negative regulator of HSF-1 (Satyal et al., 1998Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Negative regulation of the heat shock transcriptional response by HSBP1.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Results from yeast two-hybrid experiments also suggested that worm DDL-1 may interact with both HSB-1 and DDL-2 (Li et al., 2004Li S. Armstrong C.M. Bertin N. Ge H. Milstein S. Boxem M. Vidalain P.O. Han J.D. Chesneau A. Hao T. et al.A map of the interactome network of the metazoan C. elegans.Science. 2004; 303: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of HSB-1 is achieved via protein-protein interactions between HSB-1 and the oligomerization motif of HSF-1 (Satyal et al., 1998Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Negative regulation of the heat shock transcriptional response by HSBP1.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that DDL-1/2 (i.e., DDL-1 and DDL-2) and HSB-1 may regulate the activity of HSF-1 via the formation of an inhibitory complex. To test this hypothesis, we first asked whether hsf-1 is required for ddl-1 and ddl-2 to influence longevity. The life spans of hsf-1(sy441) mutants, which have been reported to exhibit reduced heat-shock response and shortened life span (Hajdu-Cronin et al., 2004Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Chen W.J. Sternberg P.W. The L-type cyclin CYL-1 and the heat-shock-factor HSF-1 are required for heat-shock-induced protein expression in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2004; 168: 1937-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), grown on ddl-1 or ddl-2 RNAi bacteria were measured. We found that RNAi treatment of ddl-1 or ddl-2 failed to produce any significant life span extension on hsf-1(sy441) mutants (Figures 2A and 2B and Table 1), whereas reducing expression of ddl-1 or ddl-2 by RNAi extends life span by 12%–24% in our hands (Figures 2A and 2B and Tables 1 and S1). This finding suggests that hsf-1 is required for the extended life span observed in ddl-1 or ddl-2 RNAi-treated animals. Consistent with the idea that DDL-1/2 may influence longevity by altering HSF-1 activity, animals grown on ddl-1 or ddl-2 RNAi bacteria exhibit increased resistance to both heat and oxidative stresses (Figures S2A and S2B ). Although reducing ddl-1/2 expression extends wild-type life span, overexpression of ddl-1/2 is not sufficient to alter wild-type life span (Figures S2C–S2E). Overexpression of ddl-1, however, does reverse the life span-extending phenotypes of ddl-1(ok2916) mutants (Figure S2F). It is possible that the residual activity of HSF-1 is sufficient to ensure survival under experimental conditions (at 20°C, without heat stress).Table 1Effects of ddl-1, ddl-2, and hsb-1 Mutations on Life SpanStrainMean Life Span ± SEM (Days)75th Percentile (Days)P ValuenN2; control (i)17.2 ± 0.321−67/90N2; ddl-1(RNAi) (i)19.1 ± 0.3220.0034ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.84/90hsf-1(sy441); control14.9 ± 0.116<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.101/169hsf-1(sy441); ddl-1(RNAi)14.9 ± 0.317<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment., <0.0001bCompared to N2 grown on the same RNAi bacteria., 0.74cCompared to the same mutants grown on vector control.96/170N2; control (ii)17.2 ± 0.220−63/82N2; ddl-2(RNAi) (ii)19.2 ± 0.2220.0008ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.68/86hsf-1(sy441); control13.6 ± 0.215<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.86/156hsf-1(sy441); ddl-2(RNAi)13.2 ± 0.114<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment., <0.0001bCompared to N2 grown on the same RNAi bacteria., 0.26cCompared to the same mutants grown on vector control.107/156N2; control (iii)19.1 ± 0.222−62/72N2; hsf-1(RNAi)11.2 ± 0.212<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.46/72hsb-1(cg116); control30.0 ± 0.435<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.74/84hsb-1(cg116); hsf-1(RNAi)11.1 ± 0.212<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment., 0.78bCompared to N2 grown on the same RNAi bacteria., <0.0001cCompared to the same mutants grown on vector control.33/84N2 (i)18.9 ± 0.222−60/72ddl-1(ok2916)25.1 ± 0.327<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.65/72hsb-1(cg116) (i)30.3 ± 0.535<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.62/72hsb-1(cg116); ddl-1(ok2916)29.9 ± 0.335<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment., <0.0001dCompared to ddl-1(ok2916) mutants., 0.51eCompared to hsb-1(cg116) mutants.57/72N2 (ii)17.1 ± 0.421−52/72ddl-2(ok3235)22.6 ± 0.326<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.32/72hsb-1(cg116) (ii)26.8 ± 0.432<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.32/72hsb-1(cg116); ddl-2(ok3235)28.6 ± 0.432<0.0001ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment., <0.0026fCompared to ddl-2(ok3235) mutants., 0.32eCompared to hsb-1(cg116) mutants.31/72N2; control(RNAi) (iv)17.2 ± 0.623−82/90N2; ddl-1(RNAi) (iv)21.3 ± 0.5250.0006ap values calculated by pairwise comparisons to N2 grown on vector control of the same experiment.81/90N2; ddl-2(RNAi) (iv)21.4 ± 0.6280."

Here, we identified several androgen-regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) that may contribute to the development of CRPC. Seven miRNAs, miR-21, miR-32, miR-99a, miR-99b, miR-148a, miR-221 and miR-590-5p, were found to be differentially expressed in CRPC compared with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) according to microarray analyses. Significant growth advantage for LNCaP cells transfected with pre-miR-32 and pre-miR-148a was found. miR-32 was demonstrated to reduce apoptosis, whereas miR-148a enhanced proliferation. Androgen regulation of miR-32 and miR-148a was confirmed by androgen stimulation of the LNCaP cells followed by expression analyses. The AR-binding sites in proximity of these miRNAs were demonstrated with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). To identify target genes for the miRNAs, mRNA microarray analyses were performed with LNCaP cells transfected with pre-miR-32 and pre-miR-148a. Expression of BTG2 and PIK3IP1 was reduced in the cells transfected with pre-miR-32 and pre-miR-148a, respectively. Also, the protein expression was reduced according to western blot analysis. BTG2 and PIK3IP1 were confirmed to be targets by 3′UTR-luciferase assays. Finally, immunostainings showed a statistically significant (P<0.0001) reduction of BTG2 protein in CRPCs compared with untreated prostate cancer (PC). The lack of BTG2 staining was also associated (P<0.01) with a short progression-free time in patients who underwent prostatectomy. In conclusion, androgen-regulated miR-32 is overexpressed in CRPC, leading to reduced expression of BTG2. Thus, miR-32 is a potential marker for aggressive disease and is a putative drug target in PC."
https://openalex.org/W2140728495,"Transcriptome sequencing and analysis of hybrid embryos show that in contrast to early animal embryogenesis, early plant embryogenesis is mostly under zygotic control. Maternally derived gene products control embryonic development before the activation of the zygotic genome in animals. The textbook view is that much the same happens in plants, yet this seems to conflict with some genetic and gene-expression results. Using transcriptome sequencing and analysis from carefully constructed hybrid embryos, Michael Nodine and David Bartel show that, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, early embryogenesis is mostly under zygotic control, with both parental genomes making essentially equal contributions to the zygotic transcriptome. In animals, maternal gene products deposited into eggs regulate embryonic development before activation of the zygotic genome1. In plants, an analogous period of prolonged maternal control over embryogenesis is thought to occur based on some gene-expression studies2,3,4,5,6. However, other gene-expression studies and genetic analyses show that some transcripts must derive from the early zygotic genome7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, implying that the prevailing model does not fully explain the nature of zygotic genome activation in plants. To determine the maternal, paternal and zygotic contributions to the early embryonic transcriptome, we sequenced the transcripts of hybrid embryos from crosses between two polymorphic inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and used single-nucleotide polymorphisms diagnostic of each parental line to quantify parental contributions. Although some transcripts seemed to be either inherited from primarily one parent or transcribed from imprinted loci, the vast majority of transcripts were produced in near-equal amounts from both maternal and paternal alleles, even during the initial stages of embryogenesis. Results of reporter experiments and analyses of transcripts from genes that are not expressed in sperm and egg indicate early and widespread zygotic transcription. Thus, in contrast to early animal embryogenesis, early plant embryogenesis is mostly under zygotic control."
https://openalex.org/W1995039837,"Reactivation of the androgen receptor (AR) during androgen depletion therapy (ADT) underlies castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). Alternative splicing of the AR gene and synthesis of constitutively active COOH-terminally truncated AR variants lacking the AR ligand-binding domain has emerged as an important mechanism of ADT resistance in CRPCa. In a previous study, we demonstrated that altered AR splicing in CRPCa 22Rv1 cells was linked to a 35-kb intragenic tandem duplication of AR exon 3 and flanking sequences. In this study, we demonstrate that complex patterns of AR gene copy number imbalances occur in PCa cell lines, xenografts and clinical specimens. To investigate whether these copy number imbalances reflect AR gene rearrangements that could be linked to splicing disruptions, we carried out a detailed analysis of AR gene structure in the LuCaP 86.2 and CWR-R1 models of CRPCa. By deletion-spanning PCR, we discovered a 8579-bp deletion of AR exons 5, 6 and 7 in the LuCaP 86.2 xenograft, which provides a rational explanation for synthesis of the truncated AR v567es AR variant in this model. Similarly, targeted resequencing of the AR gene in CWR-R1 cells led to the discovery of a 48-kb deletion in AR intron 1. This intragenic deletion marked a specific CWR-R1 cell population with enhanced expression of the truncated AR-V7/AR3 variant, a high level of androgen-independent AR transcriptional activity and rapid androgen independent growth. Together, these data demonstrate that structural alterations in the AR gene are linked to stable gain-of-function splicing alterations in CRPCa."

Mechanisms that regulate availability of CXCL12 in tumor microenvironments will substantially impact cancer progression and ongoing efforts to target the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway for cancer chemotherapy. We used dual luciferase imaging to investigate CXCR7-dependent scavenging of CXCL12 in breast tumors in vivo and quantify effects of CXCR7 on tumor growth and metastasis of a separate population of CXCR4+ breast cancer cells. In a mouse xenograft model of human breast cancer, in vivo imaging showed that malignant cells expressing CXCR7 reduced bioluminescent CXCL12 secreted in the primary tumor microenvironment. Capitalizing on sensitive detection of bioluminescent CXCL12, we also demonstrated that CXCR7+ cells reduced amounts of chemokine released from orthotopic tumors into the circulation. Immunofluorescence staining of human primary breast cancers showed expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 on malignant cells in ≈30% of cases. In most cases, CXCR4 and CXCR7 predominantly were expressed on separate populations of malignant cells in a tumor. We modeled these cases of human breast cancer by co-implanting tumor xenografts with CXCR4+ breast cancer cells, human mammary fibroblasts secreting CXCL12, and CXCR7+ or control breast cancer cells. Bioluminescence imaging showed that CXCR7+ breast cancer cells enhanced proliferation of CXCR4+ breast cancer cells in orthotopic tumors and spontaneous metastases. Treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of CXCR7 chemokine limited the growth of CXCR4+ breast cancer cells in tumors that also contained malignant CXCR7+ cells. These studies establish a new in vivo imaging method to quantify chemokine scavenging by CXCR7 in the tumor microenvironment and identify that CXCR7+ cells promote growth and metastasis of CXCR4+ breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2165889264,"Following synthesis, integral membrane proteins dwell in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for variable periods that are typically rate limiting for plasma membrane delivery. In neurons, the ER extends for hundreds of microns as an anastomosing network throughout highly branched dendrites. However, little is known about the mobility, spatial scales, or dynamic regulation of cargo in the dendritic ER. Here, we show that membrane proteins, including AMPA-type glutamate receptors, rapidly diffuse within the continuous network of dendritic ER but are confined by increased ER complexity at dendritic branch points and near dendritic spines. The spatial range of receptor mobility is rapidly restricted by type I mGluR signaling through a mechanism involving protein kinase C (PKC) and the ER protein CLIMP63. Moreover, local zones of ER complexity compartmentalize ER export and correspond to sites of new dendritic branches. Thus, local control of ER complexity spatially scales secretory trafficking within elaborate dendritic arbors."

Studies of CREB have focused on its phosphorylation, although the diversity of CREB functions in the brain suggests additional forms of regulation. Here we expand on a chemoenzymatic strategy for quantifying glycosylation stoichiometries to characterize the functional roles of CREB glycosylation in neurons. We show that CREB is dynamically modified with an O-linked β-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine sugar in response to neuronal activity and that glycosylation represses CREB-dependent transcription by impairing its association with CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC; also known as transducer of regulated CREB activity). Blocking glycosylation of CREB alters cellular function and behavioral plasticity, enhancing both axonal and dendritic growth and long-term memory consolidation. Our findings demonstrate a new role for O-glycosylation in memory formation and provide a mechanistic understanding of how glycosylation contributes to critical neuronal functions.

The speed of recalled spike sequences may reflect the internal dynamics of the network rather than the motion speed. In awake rats, such recall was observed during a synchronized ('quiet wakeful') brain state having large-amplitude, low-frequency local field potential (LFP) but not in a desynchronized ('active') state having low-amplitude, high-frequency LFP.

Protein serine-threonine kinase casein kinase II (CK2) is involved in a myriad of cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation through its phosphorylation of hundreds of substrates, yet how CK2 function is regulated is poorly understood. Here we report that the CK2 catalytic subunit CK2α is modified by O-linked β-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on Ser347, proximal to a cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation site (Thr344). We use protein semisynthesis to show that phosphorylation of Thr344 increases the cellular stability of CK2α by strengthening its interaction with Pin1, whereas glycosylation of Ser347 seems to be antagonistic to Thr344 phosphorylation and permissive to proteasomal degradation. By performing kinase assays with site-specifically phospho- and glyco-modified CK2α in combination with CK2β and Pin1 binding partners on human protein microarrays, we show that the kinase substrate selectivity of CK2 is modulated by these specific post-translational modifications. This study suggests how a promiscuous protein kinase can be regulated at multiple levels to achieve particular biological outputs."

Assembly of the major spliceosome, responsible for splicing of over 90% of human pre-mRNAs, begins with the recruitment of U1 snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles) to the pre-mRNA 5′ exon/intron junction via base pairing of the U1 snRNA with the splice site. U2 snRNPs subsequently bind to the pre-mRNA branchpoint sequence (BPS) near the 3′ intron boundary, also in part via base-pairing interactions. Further remodeling of the spliceosome results in the recruitment of additional snRNPs, including U6 snRNPs that will replace U1 snRNPs at 5′ pre-mRNA splice sites. Base pairing of U6 with U2 snRNAs juxtaposes the 5′ splice site and the BPS, the reactants of the first transesterification reaction. Thus, recognition and removal of introns and subsequent exon ligation depend in part on the dynamic base pairing of snRNAs with pre-mRNAs and with each other. Given the critical importance of pre-mRNA splicing to the regulation of gene expression and proteome diversity, it follows that mutations in RNA-processing proteins that may influence pre-mRNA splicing cause human disease (Cooper et al., 2009Cooper T.A.

Indeed, dominant mutations in multiple ubiquitously expressed protein components of the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP cause retinitis pigmentosa (Mordes et al., 2006Mordes D. Luo X. Kar A. Kuo D. Xu L.

Mutations in the SMN1 (survival of motor neuron 1) gene, which encodes a protein essential for U snRNP biogenesis, cause motor neuron degeneration in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (Lefebvre et al., 1995Lefebvre S.

Although SMN is ubiquitously expressed, alterations in the levels of individual snRNAs and numerous aberrant transcripts were observed in a tissue-specific fashion in SMN-deficient mice (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang Z.

Mutations in genes encoding the ubiquitously expressed DNA/RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS/TLS, are associated with some cases of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2010Lagier-Tourenne C.

These findings strongly implicate alterations in RNA processing as a key event in several neurodegenerative disorders. However, given the multiple functions of these proteins, the pathogenic basis of these diseases remains unclear. Recently, mutations in the gene encoding U4atac snRNA, a component of the minor spliceosome that splices a restricted (U12-dependent) class of introns found in less than 1% of human genes, have been linked to the developmental disorder microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (Edery et al., 2011Edery P. Marcaillou C. Sahbatou M. Labalme A. Chastang J. Touraine R. Tubacher E. Senni F. Bober M.B.

However, to date, mutations in the major spliceosomal snRNA genes have not been associated with disease, perhaps in part due to their ubiquitous expression and essential function. Furthermore, unlike the U4atac gene, the snRNAs of the major spliceosome are encoded by multiple genes and pseudogenes in metazoans (Marz et al., 2008Marz M. Kirsten T. Stadler P.F. Evolution of spliceosomal snRNA genes in metazoan animals.J. Mol. Evol. 2008; 67: 594-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that these genes are highly redundant. Although differing in organization (e.g., U1 and U2 genes exist in large chromosomal clusters in the human genome, whereas other snRNA genes are not clustered; Manser and Gesteland, 1982Manser T.

USA. 1984; 81: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), sequence analysis of snRNA genes suggests that they have apparently undergone concerted evolution, i.e., members of gene families are identical or nearly so within a species (Marz et al., 2008Marz M.

However, the effect of polymorphisms in individual members of these repetitive gene families on pre-mRNA splicing and the extent to which the expression of single genes is independently regulated are largely unknown. Here, we report that a 5 nucleotide (nt) deletion in one member of a cluster of mouse U2 snRNA genes causes neurodegeneration and alternative splicing defects, including the retention of small introns. Our study provides definitive evidence for the causative role of splicing dysfunction in neurodegeneration and a model to dissect the role of major spliceosomal snRNAs on the regulation of mammalian pre-mRNA splicing. The NMF (Neuroscience Mutagenesis Facility) 291 mutation was identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen for recessive mutations that result in neurological phenotypes (Bult et al., 2004Bult C. Kibbe W.A. Snoddy J. Vitaterna M. Swanson D. Pretel S. Li Y. Hohman M.M. Rinchik E. Takahashi J.S. et al.A genome end-game: understanding gene function in the nervous system.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 484-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for this mutation developed mild tremors by 8 weeks of age, which progressed to overt truncal ataxia by 12 weeks (see Movie S1 available online). At 4 weeks of age, the brains of mutant mice appeared grossly normal (Figures S1A–S1D ). However, histological analysis revealed granule cells with pyknotic nuclei in the mutant cerebellum beginning at 4 weeks of age (data not shown). Neuron loss was progressive, and by 4 months of age, most granule cells had degenerated (Figures 1A–1F ). However, other cerebellar neurons, including Purkinje cells, did not degenerate, even in aged mice (data not shown). Although neuron death was most severe in the cerebellum, later-onset degeneration of granule cells in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus was also observed (Figures S1E–S1H).Figure 1Progressive Granule Cell Degeneration in the NMF291−/− CerebellumShow full caption(A–F) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sagittal sections of WT (+/+) and NMF291−/− cerebella.

To determine the nature of neuron death, immunostaining with activated caspase-3 antibodies was performed on cerebellar sections from 6-week-old mice. Many immunopositive granule cells were observed in the mutant, but not the wild-type (WT) cerebellum, suggesting that mutant neurons undergo apoptosis (Figures 1G and 1H). Granule cell apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) analysis (Figures 1I and 1J). The NMF291 mutation was initially localized to distal Chromosome 11 by a genome scan analysis of F2 mice using polymorphic microsatellite markers. Additional recombination mapping narrowed the mutation interval to a 0.52 cM (0.34 Mb) region between D11Mit200 and D11Mit199 containing eight protein-coding genes (Figures 2A , 2B, and S2A). No coding sequence polymorphisms between mutant and WT DNA were found in these genes, nor did we observe differences in the expression of the cerebellar transcripts of these genes between genotypes (data not shown). In addition to the protein-coding genes, a cluster of five U2 snRNA (Rnu2-6 to Rnu2-10) genes also resides in the NMF291 critical interval (Figure 2B). The RNAs encoded by these genes are identical, except for a single nucleotide polymorphism in Rnu2-6 (Figure S2B ). Sequencing of mutant genomic DNA revealed a 5 bp deletion between nt 30 and 34 (30AGUGU34) in a highly conserved region of the Rnu2-8 transcription unit (Figures 2C and 2D). This deletion removes the first 2 nt of the U2 consensus branch site recognition sequence (BSRS) (33GUAGUA38) and the 3 nt linker region (30AGU33) between the BSRS and U2/U6 helix IA (Figures 2D and 2E) (Wahl et al., 2009Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. The spliceosome: design principles of a dynamic RNP machine.Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The deletion was not observed in genomic DNA from several other inbred stains, including C57BL6/J and 129S4/SvJae, from which the F1 ES cells used for mutagenesis were derived (data not shown). To confirm that the U2 gene disrupted by the NMF291 deletion is indeed expressed, we performed northern blot analysis and RNase protection assays (RPAs) using cerebellar RNA isolated from P30 WT and mutant mice. Total U2 snRNA levels were similar between the WT and the NMF291−/− cerebellum (Figure 3A ), and both WT and the deletion-containing Rnu2-8 RNAs were detected in the mutant cerebellum (Figures 3B and 3C), with the mutant transcript found at 78.9% ± 6.3% (n = 6) of the level of the WT U2 snRNA (or ∼45% of total U2 levels). Similar analysis of highly pure granule cell cultures demonstrated that both WT and mutant U2 RNAs were expressed within the same cell type (data not shown). Finally, immunoprecipitation experiments using Y12 antibody, which precipitates U snRNPs (Lerner et al., 1981Lerner E.A. Lerner M.R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Steitz J.A. Monoclonal antibodies to nucleic acid-containing cellular constituents: probes for molecular biology and autoimmune disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78: 2737-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), demonstrated that the mutant U2 snRNAs were assembled into mutant cerebellar U2 snRNPs (Figures S3A and S3B), consistent with previous reports that the free snRNA pool is relatively very small and unstable (Sauterer et al., 1988Sauterer R.A. Feeney R.J. Zieve G.W. Cytoplasmic assembly of snRNP particles from stored proteins and newly transcribed snRNA's in L929 mouse fibroblasts.Exp.

Then we defined the wild-type (+/+) normalized total U2 level and NMF291−/− normalized mutant U2 level as arbitrary unit one for relative total and mutant U2 expression level, respectively. Note that the relative total U2 snRNA levels in the P30 wild-type, NMF291+/–, and NMF291−/− cerebellum are similar, and that the mutant allele specific primers preferentially (∼30 fold) amplify mutant U2 in NMF291−/− cerebellar cDNA relative to wild-type U2 in wild-type cerebellar cDNA.(B) Incorporation of mutant U2 snRNAs into U2 snRNPs in the NMF291−/− cerebellum.

In all panels, values represent mean ± SEM, n = 3. Mammalian U2 snRNAs, like other U snRNAs, are believed to be ubiquitously and highly expressed (Egloff et al., 2008Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Murphy S.

Small nuclear RNA genes: a model system to study fundamental mechanisms of transcription.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26733-26736Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, neurodegeneration in NMF291−/− mice was very distinct, with profound neuron loss occurring within the cerebellum beginning at P30. To determine if expression of mutant Rnu2-8 correlates with the specificity of pathological changes, we performed RPA and northern blot assays using neuronal and non-neuronal tissues from the P30 WT and homozygous mutant mice (Figures 3D and S3C). Surprisingly, mutant Rnu2-8 was differentially expressed between tissues, with highest levels observed in the cerebellum. Furthermore, mutant Rnu2-8 expression was also temporally regulated in the postnatal cerebellum. Mutant U2 RNAs comprised ∼20%–25% of the total U2 RNA levels in the P10 and P20 NMF291−/− cerebellum but rose to ∼45% of the total level at P30 (Figures 3E, S3D, and S3E). This increase was maintained at P40 but dropped slightly at P60, likely due to neuron loss in the mutant cerebellum. This temporal regulation of expression was also observed in heterozygous mice, where amounts of mutant U2 RNA were approximately half of that observed in homozygous mice (Figures 3E and S3E). Together, these data suggest that mammalian U2 snRNAs display previously unsuspected temporal and spatial variation with the expression of mutant Rnu2-8 correlating with the onset and specificity of neurodegeneration in the NMF291−/− mouse. Although mice homozygous for the NMF291 mutation were originally ascertained in our screen, the site of the Rnu2-8 deletion, the multicopy nature of the U2 genes, and the expression of WT U2 snRNAs in the mutant cerebellum suggested that this mutation might act in a gene dosage-dependent fashion. To investigate this possibility, we performed histological analysis of the cerebellum of NMF291+/− mice. Apoptotic granule cells were observed in the cerebellum of 1-month-old and older NMF291+/− mice, but the number of dying neurons was considerably reduced compared to that observed in homozygous NMF291 mice (data not shown). Differences in the overall size of the NMF291+/− cerebellum were not obvious until mice were close to 2 years of age, when mild tremors were apparent, and histological analysis revealed that many granule cells had degenerated (Figures 4A–4F ). To further test the mechanism of the Rnu2-8 mutation, we generated mice transgenic for a 1.5 kb genomic DNA fragment containing the mutant Rnu2-8 transcriptional unit and the basal regulatory elements necessary for U2 transcription and processing (Figure 4G) (Egloff et al., 2008Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Murphy S. Expression of human snRNA genes from beginning to end.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, Hernandez, 2001Hernandez N. Small nuclear RNA genes: a model system to study fundamental mechanisms of transcription.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26733-26736Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Mice from one transgenic line (Tg-MuU2) expressed mutant Rnu2-8 in the cerebellum, and expression was temporally and spatially regulated similar to that observed in NMF291−/− mice (Figures 4H–4J and S4A). Like NMF291−/− mice, hemizygous mice from this line developed pronounced ataxia by 12 weeks of age (data not shown). Histological analysis revealed dying granule cells in the cerebellum of 1-month-old transgenic mice, and by 3 months of age, most granule cells had died, similar to the time course of neuron death in NMF291−/− mice (Figures 4K and 4L; data not shown). As observed in NMF291−/− mice, neuron loss in the dentate gyrus was observed in 3-month-old transgenic mice (Figures S4B and S4C). If the severity of neurodegeneration is indeed dependent on the ratio of mutant to WT snRNAs, then the complementary experiment in which an increase in expression of WT U2 RNA on the NMF291−/− background should lead to attenuation of pathology. To test this hypothesis, we generated a transgenic mouse line carrying a BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome RP23-268K4) containing Rnu2-8 and two other U2 genes (Rnu2-9 and -10; Figure 5A ). This line was crossed to NMF291 mice to generate NMF291−/− mice carrying the BAC transgene. The percentage of mutant/total U2 snRNA was reduced in the cerebellum of Tg-268K4; NMF291−/− and Tg-268K4; NMF291+/− mice relative to that observed in the cerebellum of age-matched NMF291−/− and NMF291+/− mice (Figures 5B, S5A, and S5B). Neurodegeneration was also decreased in the cerebellum of 3-month-old Tg-268K4; NMF291−/− mice relative to that of age-matched NMF291−/− mice (Figures 5C–5F). Surprisingly, when mutant U2 RNAs represented ∼17% of total U2 levels, little granule cell loss was observed in aged Tg-268K4; NMF291+/− mice (Figures S5C–S5F ). When the percentage of mutant/total U2 RNA increased to ∼25% as observed in the NMF291+/− cerebellum, neurodegeneration was slowly progressive (Figures 4A–4F). However, when this percentage reached ∼45% (as in the P30 NMF291−/− and Tg-MuU2 cerebellum), rapid granule neuron loss was observed (Figures 1C and 4L). Taken together, our data demonstrate that the expression of the mutant Rnu2-8 gene is sufficient to induce granule cell death even in the presence of WT U2 expression, and the extent of neuron loss is dependent on the expression level of the mutant U2 snRNAs relative to that of the WT U2 snRNA.Figure S5Expression of Wild-Type U2 snRNAs Decreases Neuron Death in Aged Tg-268K4; NMF291+/− Mice, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) RNase protection assays were performed on cerebellar RNA from 15-month-old wild-type (+/+), NMF291+/– (+/–), Tg-268K4; +/+, and Tg-268K4; NMF291+/– mice.(B) Quantitative analysis of RNase protection assays of cerebellar RNA from 15-month-old NMF291+/– and Tg-268K4; NMF291+/– (Tg-268K4; +/–) mice.

https://openalex.org/W2043379458,"Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is emerging as a useful indicator of the progression and outcome of several cancers. IMP3 expression is associated with triple-negative breast carcinomas (TNBCs), which are aggressive tumors associated with poor outcome. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that signaling pathways, which are characteristic of TNBCs, impact the expression of IMP3 and that IMP3 contributes to the function of TNBCs. The data obtained reveal that IMP3 expression is repressed specifically by estrogen receptor β (ERβ) and its ligand 3βA-diol but not by ERα. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and consequent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway induce IMP3 transcription and expression. Interestingly, we discovered that the EGFR promoter contains an imperfect estrogen response element and that ERβ represses EGFR transcription. These data support a mechanism in which ERβ inhibits IMP3 expression indirectly by repressing the EGFR. This mechanism relates to the biology of TNBC, which is characterized by diminished ERβ and increased EGFR expression. We also demonstrate that IMP3 contributes to the migration and invasion of breast carcinoma cells. Given that IMP3 is an mRNA-binding protein, we determined that it binds several key mRNAs that could contribute to migration and invasion, including CD164 (endolyn) and MMP9. Moreover, expression of these mRNAs is repressed by ERβ and enhanced by EGFR signaling, consistent with our proposed mechanism for the regulation of IMP3 expression in breast cancer cells. Our findings show that IMP3 is an effector of EGFR-mediated migration and invasion and they provide the first indication of how this important mRNA-binding protein is regulated in cancer."

The thyroid index of a tissue was defined as the median expression of these thyroid-specific genes in that tissue. As expected, the thyroid index was inversely correlated with meta-PCNA, a proliferation metagene, across a wide range of thyroid tumors. By contrast, the two indices were positively correlated in a time course of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) activation of primary thyrocytes. Thus, the thyroid index captures biological information not integrated by proliferation rates. The differential diagnostic of follicular thyroid adenomas and follicular thyroid carcinoma is a notorious challenge for pathologists. The thyroid index discriminated them as accurately as did machine-learning classifiers trained on the genome-wide cancer data. Hence, although it was established exclusively from normal tissue data, the thyroid index integrates the relevant diagnostic information contained in tumoral transcriptomes. Similar results were obtained for the classification of the follicular vs classical variants of papillary thyroid cancers, that is, tumors dedifferentiating along a different route. The automated procedures demonstrated in the thyroid are applicable to other organs."
https://openalex.org/W2032204792,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor with a very poor prognosis, calling for novel treatment strategies. Here, we provide first evidence that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) prime glioblastoma cells for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) -induced apoptosis at least in part by c-myc-mediated downregulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP). Pretreatment with distinct HDACI (MS275, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, valproic acid) significantly enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in several glioblastoma cell lines. Monitoring a panel of apoptosis-regulatory proteins revealed that MS275 reduces the expression of cFLIPL and cFLIPS. This leads to decreased recruitment of cFLIPL and cFLIPS and increased activation of caspase-8 to the TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex, resulting in enhanced cleavage of caspase-8, -9 and -3 and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Also, MS275 promotes TRAIL-triggered processing of Bid, activation of Bax, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. MS275-mediated downregulation of cFLIP occurs at the mRNA level independent of proteasome- or caspase-mediated degradation, and is preceded by upregulation of nuclear levels of c-myc, a transcriptional repressor of cFLIP. Notably, MS275 causes increased binding of c-myc to the cFLIP promoter and reduces cFLIP promoter activity. Indeed, knockdown of c-myc partially rescues cFLIPL from MS275-inferred downregulation and significantly decreases TRAIL- and MS275-induced apoptosis. Also, overexpression of cFLIPL or cFLIPS significantly reduces MS275- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Importantly, MS275 sensitizes primary cultured glioblastoma cells towards TRAIL and cooperates with TRAIL to reduce long-term clonogenic survival of glioblastoma cells and to suppress glioblastoma growth in vivo underscoring the clinical relevance of this approach. Thus, these findings demonstrate that HDACI represent a promising strategy to prime glioblastoma for TRAIL-induced apoptosis by targeting cFLIP."
https://openalex.org/W1973980333,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has one of the worst prognoses of all cancers. Mucin 1 (MUC1), a transmembrane mucin glycoprotein, is a key modulator of several signaling pathways that affect oncogenesis, motility and metastasis. Its expression is known to be associated with poor prognosis in patients. However, the precise mechanism remains elusive. We report a novel association of MUC1 with platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGFA). PDGFA is one of the many drivers of tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in PDA. Using mouse PDA models as well as human samples, we show clear evidence that MUC1 regulates the expression and secretion of PDGFA. This, in turn, influences proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells leading to higher tumor burden in vivo. In addition, we reveal that MUC1 overexpressing cells are heavily dependent on PDGFA both for proliferation and invasion, whereas MUC1-null cells are not. Moreover, PDGFA and MUC1 are critical for translocation of β catenin to the nucleus for oncogenesis to ensue. Finally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which MUC1 regulates PDGFA expression and secretion in pancreatic cancer cells. We show that MUC1 associates with Hif1-α, a known transcription factor involved in controlling PDGFA expression. Furthermore, MUC1 facilitates Hif1-α translocation to the nucleus. In summary, we have demonstrated that MUC1-induced invasion and proliferation occurs via increased exogenous production of PDGFA. Thus, impeding MUC1 regulation of PDGFA signaling may be therapeutically beneficial for patients with PDA."
https://openalex.org/W2088667095,"TWIST1 is a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Its misregulation has been observed in various types of tumors. Using the MCF-10A-series of cell lines that recapitulate the early stages of breast cancer formation and EMT, we found TWIST1 to be upregulated during EMT and downregulated early in carcinogenesis. The TWIST1 3'UTR contains putative regulatory elements, including miRNA target sites and two cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE). We found that miR-580, CPEB1, and CPEB2 act as negative regulators of TWIST1 expression in a sequence-specific and additive/cooperative manner."
https://openalex.org/W2055310245,"We report that in breast cancer cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of the estradiol receptor alpha (ERalpha) by Src regulates cytoplasmic localization of the receptor and DNA synthesis. Inhibition of Src or use of a peptide mimicking the ERalpha p-Tyr537 sequence abolishes ERalpha tyrosine phosphorylation and traps the receptor in nuclei of estradiol-treated MCF-7 cells. An ERalpha mutant carrying a mutation of Tyr537 to phenylalanine (ER537F) persistently localizes in nuclei of various cell types. In contrast with ERalpha wt, ER537F does not associate with Ran and its interaction with Crm1 is insensitive to estradiol. Thus, independently of estradiol, ER537F is retained in nuclei, where it entangles FKHR-driving cell cycle arrest. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that overexpression of ER537F in breast cancer cells enhances FKHR interaction with cyclin D1 promoter. This mutant also counteracts cell transformation by the activated forms of Src or PI3-K. In conclusion, in addition to regulating receptor localization, ERalpha phosphorylation by Src is required for hormone responsiveness of DNA synthesis in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1977450402,"Elevated levels of the oncoprotein, osteopontin (OPN), are associated with poor outcome of several types of cancers including melanoma. We have previously reported an important involvement of DNAJB6, a member of heat-shock protein 40 (HSP40) family, in negatively impacting tumor growth. The current study was prompted by our observations reported here which revealed a reciprocal relationship between DNAJB6 and OPN in melanoma specimens. The ‘J domain’ is the most conserved domain of HSP40 family of proteins. Hence, we assessed the functional role of the J domain in activities of DNAJB6. We report that the J domain of DNAJB6 is involved in mediating OPN suppression. Deletion of the J domain renders DNAJB6 incapable of impeding malignancy and suppressing OPN. Our mechanistic investigations reveal that DNAJB6 binds HSPA8 (heat-shock cognate protein, HSC70) and causes dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) at Ser 9 by recruiting protein phosphatase, PP2A. This dephosphorylation activates GSK3β, leading to degradation of β-catenin and subsequent loss of TCF/LEF (T cell factor1/lymphoid enhancer factor1) activity. Deletion of the J domain abrogates assembly of this multiprotein complex and renders GSK3β inactive, thus, stabilizing β-catenin, a transcription co-activator for OPN expression. Our in-vitro and in-vivo functional analyses show that silencing OPN expression in the background of deletion of the J domain renders the resultant tumor cells less malignant despite the presence of stabilized β-catenin. Thus, we have uncovered a new mechanism for regulation of GSK3β activity leading to inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2138625970,"Ddx5 and ddx17 are two highly related RNA helicases involved in both transcription and splicing. These proteins coactivate transcription factors involved in cancer such as the estrogen receptor alpha, p53 and beta-catenin. Ddx5 and ddx17 are part of the splicing machinery and can modulate alternative splicing, the main mechanism increasing the proteome diversity. Alternative splicing also has a role in gene expression level regulation when it is coupled to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. In this work, we report that ddx5 and ddx17 have a dual role in the control of the pro-migratory NFAT5 transcription factor. First, ddx5 and ddx17 act as transcriptional coactivators of NFAT5 and are required for activating NFAT5 target genes involved in tumor cell migration. Second, at the splicing level, ddx5 and ddx17 increase the inclusion of NFAT5 exon 5. As exon 5 contains a pre-mature translation termination codon, its inclusion leads to the regulation of NFAT5 mRNAs by the NMD pathway and to a decrease in NFAT5 protein level. Therefore, we demonstrated for the first time that a transcriptional coregulator can simultaneously regulate the transcriptional activity and alternative splicing of a transcription factor. This dual regulation, where ddx5 and ddx17 enhance the transcriptional activity of NFAT5 although reducing its protein expression level, suggests a critical role for ddx5 and ddx17 in tumor cell migration through the fine regulation of NFAT5 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2155440541,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase aberrantly expressed in neuroblastoma, a devastating pediatric cancer of the sympathetic nervous system. Germline and somatically acquired ALK aberrations induce increased autophosphorylation, constitutive ALK activation and increased downstream signaling. Thus, ALK is a tractable therapeutic target in neuroblastoma, likely to be susceptible to both small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies-as has been shown for other receptor tyrosine kinases in malignancies such as breast and lung cancer. Small-molecule inhibitors of ALK are currently being studied in the clinic, but common ALK mutations in neuroblastoma appear to show de novo insensitivity, arguing that complementary therapeutic approaches must be developed. We therefore hypothesized that antibody targeting of ALK may be a relevant strategy for the majority of neuroblastoma patients likely to have ALK-positive tumors. We show here that an antagonistic ALK antibody inhibits cell growth and induces in vitro antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. Cytotoxicity was induced in cell lines harboring either wild type or mutated forms of ALK. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the dual Met/ALK inhibitor crizotinib sensitized cells to antibody-induced growth inhibition by promoting cell surface accumulation of ALK and thus increasing the accessibility of antigen for antibody binding. These data support the concept of ALK-targeted immunotherapy as a highly promising therapeutic strategy for neuroblastomas with mutated or wild-type ALK."
https://openalex.org/W2093518370,"The transcription of ERCC1 and other nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes is strongly influenced by c-jun. C-jun is transcriptionally regulated by Gli proteins of the Hedgehog pathway. We therefore studied the possible relationships between Gli1, c-jun, and the upregulation of ERCC1, XPD and XRCC1 in cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells. We studied the paired human ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and A2780-CP70. We used a shRNA construct that specifically degrades Gli1 message. Genes we assessed for mRNA and/or protein levels included: c-jun, ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1, Gli1, Gli2, SHH, IHH, GAPDH and α-tubulin. Platinum–DNA adduct repair was assessed by atomic absorbance spectrometry with Zeeman background correction. Use of the anti-Gli1 shRNA in cisplatin-resistant cells resulted in a block of the cell's ability to upregulate genes in response to cisplatin treatment, including: c-jun, ERCC1, XPD and XRCC1. This block in upregulation of c-jun was concurrent with a change in the phosphorylation pattern of the c-jun protein, shifting that pattern from a Ser63/73 dominant pattern, to a Thr91/93 dominant pattern. A2780-CP70 cells were treated at their cisplatin IC50, and DNA repair was assessed after pretreatment with anti-Gli1 shRNA or scrambled shRNA control. Control cells repaired 78% of platinum–DNA adducts at 12 h, compared with 33% repair in cells pretreated with anti-Gli1 shRNA resulting in a 2.4-fold difference. Pretreatment of A2780-CP70 cells with anti-Gli1 shRNA resulted in supra-additive cell killing with cisplatin; shifting the cisplatin IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) from 30 μM to 5 μM. Pretreatment of these cells with cyclopamine did not shift the cisplatin IC50. We conclude that the transcriptional protein Gli1 is important in the upregulation of these three DNA repair genes in human ovarian cancer cells, and that Gli1 strongly influences platinum–DNA adduct repair, and cellular sensitivity to cisplatin. This Gli1 role has c-jun as an intermediate in the pathway. In all, inhibition of Gli1 by a specific shRNA inhibits the upregulation of c-jun Ser63/73, and also inhibits the upregulation of three genes essential to NER (ERCC1, XPD) and base excision repair (XRCC1)."
https://openalex.org/W2090063087,"Angiogenin, a 14-kDa multifunctional pro-angiogenic growth factor, is upregulated in several types of cancers. Anti-angiogenin monoclonal antibodies used as antagonists inhibited the establishment, progression and metastasis of human cancer cells in athymic mice (Olson et al., 1994). Silencing angiogenin and inhibition of angiogenin's nuclear translocation blocked cell survival and induced cell death in B-lymphoma and endothelial cells latently infected with Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (Sadagopan et al., 2009), suggesting that actively proliferating cancer cells could be inducing angiogenin for inhibiting apoptotic pathways. However, the mechanism of cell survival and apoptosis regulation by angiogenin and their functional significance in cancer is not known. We demonstrate that angiogenin interacts with p53 and colocalizes in the nucleus. Silencing endogenous angiogenin induced p53 promoter activation and p53 target gene (p53, p21 and Bax) expression, downregulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene expression and increased p53-mediated cell death. In contrast, angiogenin expression blocked pro-apoptotic Bax and p21 expression, induced Bcl-2 and blocked cell death. Angiogenin also co-immunoprecipitated with p53 regulator protein Mdm2. Angiogenin expression resulted in the inhibition of p53 phosphorylation, increased p53-Mdm2 interaction, and consequently increased ubiquitination of p53. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that angiogenin promotes the inhibition of p53 function to mediate anti-apoptosis and cell survival. Our results reveal for the first time a novel p53 interacting function of angiogenin in anti-apoptosis and survival of cancer cells and suggest that targeting angiogenin could be an effective therapy for several cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2039343577,"Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most frequent among infiltrating tumors of the female genital tract, with myometrial invasion representing an increase in the rate of recurrences and a decrease in survival. We have previously described ETV5 transcription factor associated with myometrial infiltration in human ECs. In this work, we further investigated ETV5 orchestrating downstream effects to confer the tumor the invasive capabilities needed to disseminate in the early stages of EC dissemination. Molecular profiling evidenced ETV5 having a direct role on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In particular, ETV5 modulated Zeb1 expression and E-Cadherin repression leading to a complete reorganization of cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts. ETV5-promoted EMT resulted in the acquisition of migratory and invasive capabilities in endometrial cell lines. Furthermore, we identified the lipoma-preferred partner protein as a regulatory partner of ETV5, acting as a sensor for extracellular signals promoting tumor invasion. All together, we propose ETV5-transcriptional regulation of the EMT process through a crosstalk with the tumor surrounding microenvironment, as a principal event initiating EC invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1979378301,"Intersectin 1 (ITSN1) is a scaffold protein that regulates diverse cellular pathways, including endocytosis and several signal transduction pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Class IIβ (PI3K-C2β). ITSN1's transforming potential in vitro suggests that this scaffold protein may be involved in human tumorigenesis. Herein, we demonstrate that ITSN1 is expressed in primary human neuroblastoma tumors and tumor cell lines and is necessary for their in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic properties. Silencing ITSN1 significantly inhibits the anchorage independent growth of tumor cells in vitro and tumor formation in xenograft assays independent of MYCN status. Overexpression of the ITSN1 target, PI3K-C2β, rescues the soft agar growth of ITSN1-silenced cells demonstrating the importance of the ITSN1-PI3K-C2β pathway in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. These findings represent the first demonstration that the ITSN1-PI3K-C2β pathway has a requisite role in human cancer, specifically neuroblastomas."
https://openalex.org/W2002170815,"Sp1 is important for the transcription of many genes. Our previous studies have shown that Sp1 is degraded in normal cell, but it is preserved in cancer cells during mitosis and exists a priori in the daughter cells, ready to engage in gene transcription and thereby contributes to the proliferation and survival of cancer cells. The mechanism by which Sp1 is preserved in cancer cells during mitosis remains unknown. In this study, we observed that Sp1 strongly colocalized with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B1 during mitosis. Moreover, we showed that Sp1 is a novel mitotic substrate of CDK1/cyclin B1 and is phosphorylated by it at Thr 739 before the onset of mitosis. Phospho-Sp1 reduced its DNA-binding ability and facilitated the chromatin condensation process during mitosis. Mutation of Thr739 to alanine resulted in Sp1 remaining in the chromosomes, delayed cell-cycle progression, and eventually led to apoptosis. Screening of Sp1-associated proteins during mitosis by using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry indicated the tethering of Sp1 to myosin/F-actin. Furthermore, phospho-Sp1 and myosin/F-actin appeared to exist as a congregated ring at the periphery of the chromosome. However, at the end of mitosis and the beginning of interphase, Sp1 was dephosphorylated by PP2A and returned to the chromatin. These results indicate that cancer cells use CDK1 and PP2A to regulate the movement of Sp1 in and out of the chromosomes during cell-cycle progression, which may benefit cancer-cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2078590469,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA; monoacyl-glycerol-3-phosphate) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are bioactive lysophospholipids that regulate critical biological functions and disease processes. LPA and S1P act on distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that initiate multiple signaling cascades in many cell types. There are six known LPA receptors (LPAR1–6) and five for S1P (S1PR1–5). LPAR1-3 and S1PR1–5 constitute the Edg subfamily of GPCRs, whereas LPAR4–6 are more closely related to purinergic receptors. LPA signaling is critical to such diverse processes as vascular and neural development, lymphocyte homing (Kanda et al., 2008), and hair follicle development (Inoue et al., 2011) and is implicated in pulmonary fibrosis (Tager et al., 2008), neuropathic pain, pruritus, fetal hydrocephalus, and tumor progression. S1P signaling is essential for vascular development and endothelial integrity and plays key roles in the immune, central nervous, and cardiovascular systems (Blaho and Hla, 2011; Rivera et al., 2008).

Though LPA and S1P use similar signaling pathways, their biosynthetic routes are quite distinct. Bioactive LPA is produced extracellularly from more complex phospholipids by specific exo/ectophospholipases. In contrast, S1P is mostly synthesized intracellularly by sphingosine kinases and then exported across the plasma membrane. LPA and S1P are present in physiologically relevant concentrations in the circulation; they are rapidly turned over by cell-associated lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs). Plasma S1P regulates vascular barrier function; the role of plasma LPA is less well understood. This SnapShot summarizes the LPA/S1P biosynthetic pathways and highlights selected biological actions of either lipid."
https://openalex.org/W2027849242,"MAP17 is a small, 17-kDa, non-glycosylated membrane protein that is overexpressed in a percentage of carcinomas. In the present work, we have analyzed the role of MAP17 expression during mammary cancer progression. We have found that MAP17 is expressed in 60% human mammary tumors while it is not expressed in normal or benign neoplasias. MAP17 levels increased with breast tumor stage and were strongly correlated with mammary tumoral progression. A significant increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in MAP17-expressing cells, as compared with parental cells. This increase was further paralleled by an increase in the tumorigenic capacity of carcinoma cells but not in immortal non-tumoral breast epithelial cells, which provides a selective advantage once tumorigenesis has begun. Expression of specific MAP17 shRNA in protein-expressing tumor cells reduced their tumorigenic capabilities, which suggests that this effect is dependent upon MAP17 protein expression. Our data show that ROS functions as a second messenger that enhances tumoral properties, which are inhibited in non-tumoral cells. We have found that p38α activation mediates this response. MAP17 triggers a ROS-dependent, senescence-like response that is abolished in the absence of p38a activation. Furthermore, in human breast tumors, MAP17 activation is correlated with a lack of phosphorylation of p38α. Therefore, MAP17 is overexpressed in late-stage breast tumors, in which oncogenic activity relies on p38 insensitivity to induce intracellular ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2074108150,"The Ras association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) is a tumor suppressor whose inactivation is implicated in the development of many human cancers, including breast carcinomas. Little is known about the tumor-suppressive function of RASSF1A in breast tissue and whether its inactivation is mechanistically involved in the initiation and progression of breast tumors. Here, we show that RASSF1A inhibits breast cancer growth in vivo, and suppresses estrogen receptor (ERα) expression and function. Reconstitution of RASSF1A in MCF7 cells led to decreased ERα levels and reduced sensitivity to estrogen (E2). Concomitantly, we observed decreased expression of Id1 as well as the E2-responsive genes Bcl-2 and c-Myc that cooperatively contribute to the immortalization and transformation of breast epithelial cells. This downregulation was associated with induction of cell-cycle arrest and senescence that constitute early barriers to cancer initiation and progression. Knockdown of ERα showed that downregulation of ERα suffices to increase senescence and inhibit expression of Bcl-2, c-Myc and Id1. However, enforced expression of ERα only partially rescued RASSF1A-mediated growth inhibition and senescence, suggesting that suppression of ERα expression and activity is not the only mechanism by which RASSF1A inhibits growth and survival of breast cancer cells. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2, c-Myc and Id1 had little or no effect on RASSF1A-mediated growth arrest, indicating that RASSF1A acts dominantly over these oncogenes. Mechanistically, RASSF1A was found to suppress ERα expression through Akt1. It also transiently inhibited ERα-induced Ras-MAPK activity after exposure of cells to E2. Together, our data show that RASSF1A acts as a tumor suppressor in ERα+ mammary epithelial cells, in part through inhibiting ERα expression and activity. These findings suggest that RASSF1A has a key role in suppressing the transformation of human breast epithelial cells and ERα+ breast cancer initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2129031613,"Mdm2 is the major negative regulator of p53 tumor-suppressor activity. This oncoprotein is overexpressed in many human tumors that retain the wild-type p53 allele. As such, targeted inhibition of Mdm2 is being considered as a therapeutic anticancer strategy. The N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of Mdm2 binds to p53 and thereby inhibits the transcription of p53 target genes. Additionally, the C-terminus of Mdm2 contains a RING domain with intrinsic ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. By recruiting E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme(s), Mdm2 acts as a molecular scaffold to facilitate p53 ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Mdmx (Mdm4), an Mdm2 homolog, also has a RING domain and hetero-oligomerizes with Mdm2 to stimulate its E3 ligase activity. Recent studies have shown that C-terminal residues adjacent to the RING domain of both Mdm2 and Mdmx contribute to Mdm2 E3 ligase activity. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating this process remain unclear, and the biological consequences of inhibiting Mdm2/Mdmx co-operation or blocking Mdm2 ligase function are relatively unexplored. This study presents biochemical and cell biological data that further elucidate the mechanisms by which Mdm2 and Mdmx co-operate to regulate p53 level and activity. We use chemical and genetic approaches to demonstrate that functional inhibition of Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase activity is insufficient for p53 activation. This unexpected result suggests that concomitant treatment with Mdm2/Mdmx antagonists may be needed to achieve therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2063357994,"Decreased mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is a hallmark bioenergetic characteristic of malignancy that may have an adaptive role in carcinogenesis. By stimulating proton leak, mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP1-3) increase mitochondrial respiration and may thereby oppose cancer development. To test this idea, we generated a mouse model that expresses an epidermal-targeted keratin-5-UCP3 (K5-UCP3) transgene and exhibits significantly increased cutaneous mitochondrial respiration compared with wild type (FVB/N). Remarkably, we observed that mitochondrial uncoupling drove keratinocyte/epidermal differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. This increase in epidermal differentiation corresponded to the loss of markers of the quiescent bulge stem cell population, and an increase in epidermal turnover measured using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-based transit assay. Interestingly, these changes in K5-UCP3 skin were associated with a nearly complete resistance to chemically-mediated multistage skin carcinogenesis. These data suggest that targeting mitochondrial respiration is a promising novel avenue for cancer prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2085376492,"Early genetic events in the development of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) may define the molecular basis of the profound structural and numerical instability of chromosomes in this disease. To discover candidate genetic changes we sequentially passaged cells from a karyotypically normal hTERT immortalised human ovarian surface epithelial line (IOSE25) resulting in the spontaneous formation of colonies in soft agar. Cell lines transformed ovarian surface epithelium 1 and 4 (TOSE 1 and 4) established from these colonies had an abnormal karyotype and altered morphology, but were not tumourigenic in immunodeficient mice. TOSE cells showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at TP53, increased nuclear p53 immunoreactivity and altered expression profile of p53 target genes. The parental IOSE25 cells contained a missense, heterozygous R175H mutation in TP53, whereas TOSE cells had LOH at the TP53 locus with a new R273H mutation at the previous wild-type TP53 allele. Cytogenetic and array CGH analysis of TOSE cells also revealed a focal genomic amplification of CXCR4, a chemokine receptor commonly expressed by HGSOC cells. TOSE cells had increased functional CXCR4 protein and its abrogation reduced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, as well as colony size and number. The CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, was epigenetically silenced in TOSE cells and its forced expression increased TOSE colony size. TOSE cells had other cytogenetic changes typical of those seen in HGSOC ovarian cancer cell lines and biopsies. In addition, enrichment of CXCR4 pathway in expression profiles from HGSOC correlated with enrichment of a mutated TP53 gene expression signature and of EGFR pathway genes. Our data suggest that mutations in TP53 and amplification of the CXCR4 gene locus may be early events in the development of HGSOC, and associated with chromosomal instability."
