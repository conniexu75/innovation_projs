These components were named aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2. Structural formulae have been proposed for aflatoxins B1 and G1 (ref. 2) and the relationships between these compounds and B2 and G2 have been established1,3, the double bond in the terminal dihydrofuran ring in the first two components having become hydrogenated in the others."

https://openalex.org/W2021195003,IN the course of investigations concerning the purification of human serum haptoglobin1 we found in the α1-globulin fraction obtained by preparative zone electrophoresis at pH. 8.6 a glycoprotein hitherto not described. Because of its unusual ability to precipitate at relatively low concentrations of neutral salts and ethanol we propose to characterize this α1-glycoprotein by the term ‘easily precipitable’.

Their basic role in membrane reactions has become obvious from many other observations, including that on which we wish to report here."

https://openalex.org/W2057614351,ASCORBIC acid deficiency produces well-known alterations in wound healing. Using histoenzymatic techniques important changes have been described such as a decrease in alkaline phosphatase1 and a relative increase in acid phosphatase2 in scorbutic wounds as compared with controls. With the technique proposed by Wachstein and Meisel3 for the demonstration of adenosine triphosphatase a marked response appears in blood vessels. This investigation was carried out in order to examine adenosine triphosphatase-positive blood vessels in wounds performed in normal and scorbutic animals.
