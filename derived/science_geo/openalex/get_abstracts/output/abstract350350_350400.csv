https://openalex.org/W2085487956,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but aggressive human skin cancer that typically affects elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, a feature suggestive of an infectious origin. We studied MCC samples by digital transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a previously undescribed virus T antigen and a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase. Further investigation led to identification and sequence analysis of the 5387–base-pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus that we call Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV or MCPyV). MCV sequences were detected in 8 of 10 (80%) MCC tumors but only 5 of 59 (8%) control tissues from various body sites and 4 of 25 (16%) control skin tissues. In six of eight MCV-positive MCCs, viral DNA was integrated within the tumor genome in a clonal pattern, suggesting that MCV infection and integration preceded clonal expansion of the tumor cells. Thus, MCV may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of MCC."

https://openalex.org/W1990757263,"Tumour-initiating cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation, which are responsible for tumour growth, have been identified in human haematological malignancies and solid cancers. If such minority populations are associated with tumour progression in human patients, specific targeting of tumour-initiating cells could be a strategy to eradicate cancers currently resistant to systemic therapy. Here we identify a subpopulation enriched for human malignant-melanoma-initiating cells (MMIC) defined by expression of the chemoresistance mediator ABCB5 (refs 7, 8) and show that specific targeting of this tumorigenic minority population inhibits tumour growth. ABCB5+ tumour cells detected in human melanoma patients show a primitive molecular phenotype and correlate with clinical melanoma progression. In serial human-to-mouse xenotransplantation experiments, ABCB5+ melanoma cells possess greater tumorigenic capacity than ABCB5- bulk populations and re-establish clinical tumour heterogeneity. In vivo genetic lineage tracking demonstrates a specific capacity of ABCB5+ subpopulations for self-renewal and differentiation, because ABCB5+ cancer cells generate both ABCB5+ and ABCB5- progeny, whereas ABCB5- tumour populations give rise, at lower rates, exclusively to ABCB5- cells. In an initial proof-of-principle analysis, designed to test the hypothesis that MMIC are also required for growth of established tumours, systemic administration of a monoclonal antibody directed at ABCB5, shown to be capable of inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in ABCB5+ MMIC, exerted tumour-inhibitory effects. Identification of tumour-initiating cells with enhanced abundance in more advanced disease but susceptibility to specific targeting through a defining chemoresistance determinant has important implications for cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1981662243,"Dynein and kinesin motor proteins transport cellular cargoes toward opposite ends of microtubule tracks. In neurons, microtubules are abundantly decorated with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) such as tau. Motor proteins thus encounter MAPs frequently along their path. To determine the effects of tau on dynein and kinesin motility, we conducted single-molecule studies of motor proteins moving along tau-decorated microtubules. Dynein tended to reverse direction, whereas kinesin tended to detach at patches of bound tau. Kinesin was inhibited at about a tenth of the tau concentration that inhibited dynein, and the microtubule-binding domain of tau was sufficient to inhibit motor activity. The differential modulation of dynein and kinesin motility suggests that MAPs can spatially regulate the balance of microtubule-dependent axonal transport."
https://openalex.org/W2081623219,"A common assumption is that ecosystem services respond linearly to changes in habitat size. This assumption leads frequently to an “all or none” choice of either preserving coastal habitats or converting them to human use. However, our survey of wave attenuation data from field studies of mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, nearshore coral reefs, and sand dunes reveals that these relationships are rarely linear. By incorporating nonlinear wave attenuation in estimating coastal protection values of mangroves in Thailand, we show that the optimal land use option may instead be the integration of development and conservation consistent with ecosystem-based management goals. This result suggests that reconciling competing demands on coastal habitats should not always result in stark preservation-versus-conversion choices."
https://openalex.org/W2121533623,"Deletions on chromososme 5q are associated with myelodysplastic lesions. The genes responsible have largely remained elusive. But use of an RNA interference-based approach that can identify haploinsufficient tumour suppressor genes identifies RPS14, which regulates ribosomal RNA processing as a candidate tumour suppressor gene responsible for this so-called 5q− syndrome. Somatic chromosomal deletions in cancer are thought to indicate the location of tumour suppressor genes, by which a complete loss of gene function occurs through biallelic deletion, point mutation or epigenetic silencing, thus fulfilling Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis1. In many recurrent deletions, however, such biallelic inactivation has not been found. One prominent example is the 5q- syndrome, a subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by a defect in erythroid differentiation2. Here we describe an RNA-mediated interference (RNAi)-based approach to discovery of the 5q- disease gene. We found that partial loss of function of the ribosomal subunit protein RPS14 phenocopies the disease in normal haematopoietic progenitor cells, and also that forced expression of RPS14 rescues the disease phenotype in patient-derived bone marrow cells. In addition, we identified a block in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA in RPS14-deficient cells that is functionally equivalent to the defect in Diamond–Blackfan anaemia, linking the molecular pathophysiology of the 5q- syndrome to a congenital syndrome causing bone marrow failure. These results indicate that the 5q- syndrome is caused by a defect in ribosomal protein function and suggest that RNAi screening is an effective strategy for identifying causal haploinsufficiency disease genes."
https://openalex.org/W2034681559,"Gravel-bedded streams are thought to have a characteristic meandering form bordered by a self-formed, fine-grained floodplain. This ideal guides a multibillion-dollar stream restoration industry. We have mapped and dated many of the deposits along mid-Atlantic streams that formed the basis for this widely accepted model. These data, as well as historical maps and records, show instead that before European settlement, the streams were small anabranching channels within extensive vegetated wetlands that accumulated little sediment but stored substantial organic carbon. Subsequently, 1 to 5 meters of slackwater sedimentation, behind tens of thousands of 17th- to 19th-century milldams, buried the presettlement wetlands with fine sediment. These findings show that most floodplains along mid-Atlantic streams are actually fill terraces, and historically incised channels are not natural archetypes for meandering streams."
https://openalex.org/W2117055393,"Dietary vitamin A deficiency causes eye disease in 40 million children each year and places 140 to 250 million at risk for health disorders. Many children in sub-Saharan Africa subsist on maize-based diets. Maize displays considerable natural variation for carotenoid composition, including vitamin A precursors α-carotene, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin. Through association analysis, linkage mapping, expression analysis, and mutagenesis, we show that variation at the lycopene epsilon cyclase ( lcyE ) locus alters flux down α-carotene versus β-carotene branches of the carotenoid pathway. Four natural lcyE polymorphisms explained 58% of the variation in these two branches and a threefold difference in provitamin A compounds. Selection of favorable lcyE alleles with inexpensive molecular markers will now enable developing-country breeders to more effectively produce maize grain with higher provitamin A levels."
https://openalex.org/W2111048777,"In the age of stem cell engineering it is critical to understand how stem cell activity is regulated during regeneration. Hairs are mini-organs that undergo cyclic regeneration throughout adult life, and are an important model for organ regeneration. Hair stem cells located in the follicle bulge are regulated by the surrounding microenvironment, or niche. The activation of such stem cells is cyclic, involving periodic beta-catenin activity. In the adult mouse, regeneration occurs in waves in a follicle population, implying coordination among adjacent follicles and the extrafollicular environment. Here we show that unexpected periodic expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) and Bmp4 in the dermis regulates this process. This BMP cycle is out of phase with the WNT/beta-catenin cycle, thus dividing the conventional telogen into new functional phases: one refractory and the other competent for hair regeneration, characterized by high and low BMP signalling, respectively. Overexpression of noggin, a BMP antagonist, in mouse skin resulted in a markedly shortened refractory phase and faster propagation of the regenerative wave. Transplantation of skin from this mutant onto a wild-type host showed that follicles in donor and host can affect their cycling behaviours mutually, with the outcome depending on the equilibrium of BMP activity in the dermis. Administration of BMP4 protein caused the competent region to become refractory. These results show that BMPs may be the long-sought 'chalone' inhibitors of hair growth postulated by classical experiments. Taken together, results presented in this study provide an example of hierarchical regulation of local organ stem cell homeostasis by the inter-organ macroenvironment. The expression of Bmp2 in subcutaneous adipocytes indicates physiological integration between these two thermo-regulatory organs. Our findings have practical importance for studies using mouse skin as a model for carcinogenesis, intra-cutaneous drug delivery and stem cell engineering studies, because they highlight the acute need to differentiate supportive versus inhibitory regions in the host skin."

Here, we show biochemical evidence, by ligand binding assay and photoaffinity labeling, that the CLV3 peptide directly binds the CLV1 ectodomain with a dissociation constant of 17.5 nM. The CLV1 ectodomain also interacts with the structurally related CLE peptides, with distinct affinities depending on the specific amino acid sequence. Our results provide direct evidence that CLV3 and CLV1 function as a ligand-receptor pair involved in stem cell maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W1984916226,"Many cellular components are present in such low numbers per cell that random births and deaths of individual molecules can cause substantial “noise” in concentrations. But biochemical events do not necessarily occur in single steps of individual molecules. Some processes are greatly randomized when synthesis or degradation occurs in large bursts of many molecules during a short time interval. Conversely, each birth or death of a macromolecule could involve several small steps, creating a memory between individual events. We present a generalized theory for stochastic gene expression, formulating the variance in protein abundance in terms of the randomness of the individual gene expression events. We show that common types of molecular mechanisms can produce gestation and senescence periods that reduce noise without requiring higher abundances, shorter lifetimes, or any concentration-dependent control loops. We also show that most single-cell experimental methods cannot distinguish between qualitatively different stochastic principles, although this in turn makes such methods better suited for identifying which components introduce fluctuations. Characterizing the random events that give rise to noise in concentrations instead requires dynamic measurements with single-molecule resolution."

To analyze this pattern of flow, we compiled observations of seismic anisotropy, as manifested by shear wave splitting. Data from 13 subduction zones reveal systematic variations in both mantle-wedge and subslab anisotropy with the magnitude of trench migration velocity | V t |. These variations can be explained by flow along the strike of the trench induced by trench motion. This flow dominates beneath the slab, where its magnitude scales with | V t |. In the mantle wedge, this flow interacts with classical corner flow produced by the convergence velocity V c ; their relative influence is governed by the relative magnitude of | V t | and V c ."

https://openalex.org/W2100086434,"The earliest step in creating the cerebral cortex is the specification of neuroepithelium to a cortical fate. Using mouse genetic mosaics and timed inactivations, we demonstrated that Lhx2 acts as a classic selector gene and essential intrinsic determinant of cortical identity. Lhx2 selector activity is restricted to an early critical period when stem cells comprise the cortical neuroepithelium, where it acts cell-autonomously to specify cortical identity and suppress alternative fates in a spatially dependent manner. Laterally, Lhx2 null cells adopt antihem identity, whereas medially they become cortical hem cells, which can induce and organize ectopic hippocampal fields. In addition to providing functional evidence for Lhx2 selector activity, these findings show that the cortical hem is a hippocampal organizer."
https://openalex.org/W2095578584,"Spastin, a microtubule severing protein involved in the assembly or function of nuclear protein complexes, has attracted interest because of its role in neuronal synapse formation, and the discovery that mutations in the gene cause hereditary neurodegenerative disease. The structure of spastin has now been determined to atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography, revealing an AAA ATPase cassette augmented by structural elements unique to the microtubule severing enzyme subfamily. Mapping of hereditary spastic paraplegia mutations onto the structure of spastin reveals how disease mutations damage the enzyme. Spastin and kastin are AAA-ATPases that function as microtubule severing enzymes. Mutations in spastin are the predominant cause of hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP). The atomic structure of spastin monomer and coupled with atomic docking generate a model of spastin hexamer is solved. Spastin forms a ring with a prominent central pore and six radiating arms that dock onto the microtubule. Spastin, the most common locus for mutations in hereditary spastic paraplegias1, and katanin are related microtubule-severing AAA ATPases2,3,4,5,6 involved in constructing neuronal7,8,9,10 and non-centrosomal7,11 microtubule arrays and in segregating chromosomes12,13. The mechanism by which spastin and katanin break and destabilize microtubules is unknown, in part owing to the lack of structural information on these enzymes. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Drosophila spastin AAA domain and provide a model for the active spastin hexamer generated using small-angle X-ray scattering combined with atomic docking. The spastin hexamer forms a ring with a prominent central pore and six radiating arms that may dock onto the microtubule. Helices unique to the microtubule-severing AAA ATPases surround the entrances to the pore on either side of the ring, and three highly conserved loops line the pore lumen. Mutagenesis reveals essential roles for these structural elements in the severing reaction. Peptide and antibody inhibition experiments further show that spastin may dismantle microtubules by recognizing specific features in the carboxy-terminal tail of tubulin. Collectively, our data support a model in which spastin pulls the C terminus of tubulin through its central pore, generating a mechanical force that destabilizes tubulin–tubulin interactions within the microtubule lattice. Our work also provides insights into the structural defects in spastin that arise from mutations identified in hereditary spastic paraplegia patients."

https://openalex.org/W2059960675,"Uranium occurs in the environment predominantly as the uranyl dication [UO2]2+. Its solubility renders this species a problematic contaminant which is, moreover, chemically extraordinarily robust owing to strongly covalent U-O bonds. This feature manifests itself in the uranyl dication showing little propensity to partake in the many oxo group functionalizations and redox reactions typically seen with [CrO2]2+, [MoO2]2+ and other transition metal analogues. As a result, only a few examples of [UO2]2+ with functionalized oxo groups are known. Similarly, it is only very recently that the isolation and characterization of the singly reduced, pentavalent uranyl cation [UO2]+ has been reported. Here we show that placing the uranyl dication within a rigid and well-defined molecular framework while keeping the environment anaerobic allows simultaneous single-electron reduction and selective covalent bond formation at one of the two uranyl oxo groups. The product of this reaction is a pentavalent and monofunctionalized [O = U...OR]+ cation that can be isolated in the presence of transition metal cations. This finding demonstrates that under appropriate reaction conditions, the uranyl oxo group will readily undergo radical reactions commonly associated only with transition metal oxo groups. We expect that this work might also prove useful in probing the chemistry of the related but highly radioactive plutonyl and neptunyl analogues found in nuclear waste."

The heat stress response, a highly conserved environmental and developmental program in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, is an important component of the acclimation response of plants. Previous studies have shown that heat shock transcription factors play an important role in thermotolerance in plants and other organisms, controlling the expression of different heat shock proteins and detoxifying enzymes. In contrast, although several other pathways, involving ethylene, salicylic acid (SA), and trehalose, were recently shown to play a central role in thermotolerance in plants, a key regulator of these responses was not identified.

The following annotation for TPS was used: TPS1, At1g78580; TPS2, At1g16980; TPS3, At1g17000; TPS4, At4g27550; TPS5, At4g17770; TPS6, At1g68020; TPS7, At1g06410; TPS8, At1g70290; TPS9, At1g23870; TPS10, At1g60140; TPS11, At2g18700.Protein Purification and Antibody Production—The coding region of MBF1c was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Gold cells using the pCAL-n vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). MBF1c expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in 1 liter of liquid LB medium for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, and MBF1c was purified from inclusion bodies (37Sijwali P.S. Brinen L.S. Rosenthal P.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), resuspended in 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. MBF1c protein was cut from gels and used for the production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies (AnaSpec Inc., San Jose, CA).RESULTSCharacterization of MBF1c Protein in Arabidopsis—MBF1c protein rapidly accumulated in Arabidopsis leaves during heat stress (Fig. 1A). In contrast, MBF1c protein was not detected in wild type plants grown under controlled conditions or in a null mutant of MBF1c (mbf1c; SALK_083813). MBF1c protein was detected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing MBF1c (35S::MBF1c), grown under controlled conditions, or subjected to heat stress (Fig. 1A). The size of MBF1c protein detected by protein blots in Arabidopsis plants precisely corresponded to the predicted molecular weight of the MBF1c open reading frame (16.4 kDa; not shown).To examine subcellular localization of MBF1c, MBF1c-GFP fusion protein (C-terminal fusion) and control GFP protein were expressed in transgenic plants under the control of the 35 S CaMV promoter (35S::MBF1c-GFP and 35S::GFP, respectively). When transgenic plants with constitutive expression of MBF1c-GFP were grown under controlled conditions, MBF1c-GFP fusion protein was mainly localized to the cytosol (Fig. 1, B-D). In contrast, when plants were subjected to heat stress (1 h, 38 °C), MBF1c-GFP protein was mainly detected in nuclei, whereas the localization of the GFP control protein was not altered (Fig. 1, B-D). This response, observed with three independent transgenic lines expressing MBF1c-GFP at different levels (not shown), was not effected by leptomycin B (2 μm), an inhibitor of nuclear export, suggesting that nuclear localization of MBF1c during heat stress is a result of enhanced nuclear import (not shown).Thermotolerance of Knock-out Plants Deficient in MBF1c Expression—A null mutant of MBF1c (mbf1c; SALK_083813) was isolated and subjected to heat stress. mbf1c did not accumulate MBF1c protein in response to heat stress (Fig. 1A). Wild type, mbf1c, and 35S::MBF1c seedlings were directly subjected to heat stress (41, 43, or 45 °C) for 2 h to measure basal thermotolerance or treated at 38 °C for 1.5 h, allowed to recover for 1 h at 21 °C, and subjected to 45 °C for 2 h (38 → 45 °C), to measure acquired thermotolerance. mbf1c plants were not deficient in acquired thermotolerance (38 → 45 °C) but were deficient in basal thermotolerance at different temperatures (41, 43, or 45 °C; Fig. 2A). In contrast to mbf1c, or wild type plants, 35S::MBF1c plants were more tolerant to basal thermotolerance at 45 °C (Fig. 2A). This was also evident when the 45 °C treatment was maintained for longer than 2 h until all wild type plants died (45 °C L). The basal thermotolerance phenotype of the MBF1c null mutant (mbf1c) could be rescued by a low level of constitutive MBF1c expression (Fig. 2, B and C). As shown in Fig. 2D, MBF1c protein accumulated in wild type seedlings subjected to heat stress (41, 43, or 45 °C) for 2 h and used to measure basal thermotolerance (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2Thermotolerance of gain- and loss-of-function MBF1c plants.

Transcript expression of TPS5 was too low to be detected by RNA blots in wild type and mbf1c plants during heat stress (Fig. 3). RT-PCR analysis was therefore used and showed a transient increase in TPS5 expression during heat stress in wild type plants (Fig. 4B). In contrast, TPS5 expression was high in mbf1c plants in the absence of stress but declined during heat stress (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the steady-state transcript level of TPS5 was elevated in 35S::MBF1c plants in the presence or absence of heat stress (Fig. 4C). In silico analysis of all TPS transcripts in Arabidopsis (36Miller G. Mittler R. Ann. Bot. 2006; 98: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 38Zimmermann P. Hirsch-Hoffmann M. Hennig L. Gruissem W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2621-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar) revealed that TPS5 is the only TPS transcript elevated during heat stress in Arabidopsis (Fig. 4D). Moreover, two independent TPS5 null mutants (SALK_144791, tps5-1; SALK_007952, tps5-2) were deficient in basal (45 °C) but not acquired (38 → 45 °C) thermotolerance (Fig. 4E).FIGURE 4Interaction of MBF1c with TPS5.

In contrast, trehalose did not accumulate during heat stress in mbf1c plants (Fig. 5A), suggesting that MBF1c functions upstream to trehalose accumulation during heat stress. We therefore examined whether trehalose will rescue mbf1c plants from heat stress. Trehalose (1 mm) was able to rescue mbf1c plants as well as tps5-1 and tps5-2 and mutants deficient in ethylene (ein2-1) and SA (sid2) (39Nawrath C. Métraux J.P.

https://openalex.org/W1999334180,"Mammalian telomeres are protected by a six-protein complex: shelterin. Shelterin contains two closely related proteins (TRF1 and TRF2), which recruit various proteins to telomeres. We dissect the interactions of TRF1 and TRF2 with their shared binding partner (TIN2) and other shelterin accessory factors. TRF1 recognizes TIN2 using a conserved molecular surface in its TRF homology (TRFH) domain. However, this same surface does not act as a TIN2 binding site in TRF2, and TIN2 binding to TRF2 is mediated by a region outside the TRFH domain. Instead, the TRFH docking site of TRF2 binds a shelterin accessory factor (Apollo), which does not interact with the TRFH domain of TRF1. Conversely, the TRFH domain of TRF1, but not of TRF2, interacts with another shelterin-associated factor: PinX1."
https://openalex.org/W1989429196,"Most eukaryotic genes are interrupted by non-coding introns that must be accurately removed from pre-messenger RNAs to produce translatable mRNAs1. Splicing is guided locally by short conserved sequences, but genes typically contain many potential splice sites, and the mechanisms specifying the correct sites remain poorly understood. In most organisms, short introns recognized by the intron definition mechanism2 cannot be efficiently predicted solely on the basis of sequence motifs3. In multicellular eukaryotes, long introns are recognized through exon definition2 and most genes produce multiple mRNA variants through alternative splicing4. The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay5,6 (NMD) pathway may further shape the observed sets of variants by selectively degrading those containing premature termination codons, which are frequently produced in mammals7,8. Here we show that the tiny introns of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia are under strong selective pressure to cause premature termination of mRNA translation in the event of intron retention, and that the same bias is observed among the short introns of plants, fungi and animals. By knocking down the two P. tetraurelia genes encoding UPF1, a protein that is crucial in NMD, we show that the intrinsic efficiency of splicing varies widely among introns and that NMD activity can significantly reduce the fraction of unspliced mRNAs. The results suggest that, independently of alternative splicing, species with large intron numbers universally rely on NMD to compensate for suboptimal splicing efficiency and accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W2027241185,"The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is the major constituent of the amyloid core of senile plaques found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer disease. Abeta is produced by the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. Cleavage of APP by gamma-secretase also generates the APP intracellular C-terminal domain (AICD) peptide, which might be involved in regulation of gene transcription. APP contains three Gly-XXX-Gly (GXXXG) motifs in its juxtamembrane and transmembrane (TM) regions. Such motifs are known to promote dimerization via close apposition of TM sequences. We demonstrate that pairwise replacement of glycines by leucines or isoleucines, but not alanines, in a GXXXG motif led to a drastic reduction of Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretion. beta-Cleavage of mutant APP was not inhibited, and reduction of Abeta secretion resulted from inhibition of gamma-cleavage. It was anticipated that decreased gamma-cleavage of mutant APP would result from inhibition of its dimerization. Surprisingly, mutations of the GXXXG motif actually enhanced dimerization of the APP C-terminal fragments, possibly via a different TM alpha-helical interface. Increased dimerization of the TM APP C-terminal domain did not affect AICD production."

https://openalex.org/W2032586701,"The evolutionary changes that occur over a small number of generations in natural populations often run counter to what is expected on the basis of the heritability of traits and the selective forces acting upon them. In Soay sheep, dark coat color is associated with large size, which is heritable and positively correlated with fitness, yet the frequency of dark sheep has decreased. This unexpected microevolutionary trend is explained by genetic linkage between the causal mutation underlying the color polymorphism and quantitative trait loci with antagonistic effects on size and fitness. As a consequence, homozygous dark sheep are large, but have reduced fitness relative to phenotypically indistinguishable dark heterozygotes and light sheep. This result demonstrates the importance of understanding the genetic basis of fitness variation when making predictions about the microevolutionary consequences of selection."
https://openalex.org/W1999099522,"Cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) are N-glycosylated, endoplasmic reticulum-resident, integral membrane proteins that catalyze the committed step in prostanoid synthesis. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many types of cells, whereas COX-2 is usually expressed inducibly and transiently. The control of COX-2 protein expression occurs at several levels, and overexpression of COX-2 is associated with pathologies such as colon cancer. Here we have investigated COX-2 protein degradation and demonstrate that it can occur through two independent pathways. One pathway is initiated by post-translational N-glycosylation at Asn-594. The N-glycosyl group is then processed, and the protein is translocated to the cytoplasm, where it undergoes proteasomal degradation. We provide evidence from site-directed mutagenesis that a 27-amino acid instability motif (27-IM) regulates posttranslational N-glycosylation of Asn-594. This motif begins with Glu-586 8 residues upstream of the N-glycosylation site and ends with Lys-612 near the C terminus at Leu-618. Key elements of the 27-IM include a helix involving residues Glu-586 to Ser-596 with Asn-594 near the end of this helix and residues Leu-610 and Leu-611, which are located in an apparently unstructured downstream region of the 27-IM. The last 16 residues of the 27-IM, including Leu-610 and Leu-611, appear to promote N-glycosylation of Asn-594 perhaps by causing this residue to become exposed to appropriate glycosyl transferases. A second pathway for COX-2 protein degradation is initiated by substrate-dependent suicide inactivation. Suicide-inactivated protein is then degraded. The biochemical steps have not been resolved, but substrate-dependent degradation is not inhibited by proteasome inhibitors or inhibitors of lysosomal proteases. The pathway involving the 27-IM occurs at a constant rate, whereas degradation through the substrate-dependent process is coupled to the rate of substrate turnover.

The pathway involving the 27-IM occurs at a constant rate, whereas degradation through the substrate-dependent process is coupled to the rate of substrate turnover.

At the COX active site, AA is oxygenated to form prostaglandin endoperoxide G2 (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 2Rouzer C.A. Marnett L.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2239-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3van der Donk W.A.

Prostaglandin endoperoxide G2 then moves to the peroxidase site, where its hydroperoxy group undergoes a two-electron reduction to form prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L.

Prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 is a common substrate for downstream terminal prostanoid synthases that form various prostanoids. COX-1 is a stable protein that is constitutively expressed in resting cells of many tissues, notably in platelets and vesicular gland (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev.

Both COX-2 mRNA and protein have been found to possess instability elements that target them for rapid degradation. At the 3′-untranslated region of COX-2 mRNA are multiple AUUUA elements that target mRNAs for rapid exonuclease cleavage (21Tanabe T. Tohnai N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 26Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). COX-1 mRNA lacks these 3′-untranslated region AU-rich elements, and COX-1 mRNA is stable in megakaryocytes and vascular endothelial cells (27Xu X.M. Tang J.L. Chen X. Wang L.H. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

We have recently reported that the C-terminal 19-aa of COX-2 causes the enzyme to undergo proteasomal degradation via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (18Mbonye U.R. Wada M. Rieke C.J. Tang H.Y. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35770-35778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, we set out to examine what specific features of the C-terminal 19-aa, in addition to the Asn-594 glycosylation site, are critical for targeting the enzyme to the ERAD system. The role of the helical region upstream of the Asn-594 glycosylation site in regulating Asn-594 was also investigated. Our findings enabled us to identify a C-terminal 27-amino acid destabilizing motif (27-IM) of COX-2 that regulates the glycosylation of the enzyme at Asn-594 and controls, at least in part, the timing and extent of its degradation. In the course of our studies on COX-2 degradation, we discovered that N594A human COX (huCOX)-2, which lacks a functional 27-IM, was degraded rapidly when AA was added to cells expressing this mutant. This led us to examine the impact of COX catalysis on the protein stabilities of COX-1 and COX-2. We have found that the rate of COX-2 protein degradation is enhanced by AA in NIH/3T3 and HEK293 cells in a proteasome-independent manner. We provide evidence that substrate-dependent degradation of COX-2 requires a functional COX active site and proceeds from the substrate-induced inactive form(s) of the enzyme. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), ponasterone A, and tetracycline were obtained from Invitrogen. Bovine calf serum was from Hyclone. Arachidonic acid, (R/S)-flurbiprofen, (S)-flurbiprofen, (R)-flurbiprofen, and NS-398 were from Cayman Chemicals. (S)-flurbiprofen and NS-398 are time-dependent, irreversible inhibitors of COX activity, whereas (R)-flurbiprofen is a competitive COX inhibitor. Cycloheximide, puromcyin, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and GSH were purchased from Sigma. Calcium ionophore (A23187), bradykinin, and MG132 were purchased from Calbiochem. Endoglycosidase H was purchased from Roche Applied Science. [1-14C]AA (55 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Microsomal PGES-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Garavito (Michigan State University). Construction of Plasmids for Transfection—Recombinant ovine COX (ovCOX)-1 and huCOX-2 cDNA were subcloned into the tetracycline-inducible vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen). After subcloning, the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create the following C-terminal mutants: N594A huCOX-2, del595-612 huCOX-2, del602-612 huCOX-2, del607-612 huCOX-2, P607A/T608A huCOX-2, V609A huCOX-2, L610A huCOX-2, L611A huCOX-2, K612A huCOX-2, V591P T592G huCOX-2, ovCOX-1 UPSTRM8 huCOX-2, murine COX (muCOX)-2 UPSTRM8 huCOX-2, ins594-612 ovCOX-1, ins594-612 (N594A) ovCOX-1, ins586-612 ovCOX-1, and ins586-612 (N594A) ovCOX-1. Recombinant ovCOX-1 was also subcloned into the ecdysone-inducible pIND vector (Invitrogen) and used to develop the following constructs: ins594-596 ovCOX-1, ins595-597 ovCOX-1, and ins594-601 ovCOX-1. The COX-2 mutants, scrambled insert 595-612 (Sins595-612) huCOX-2 and Sins597-612 huCOX-2, were created from the cDNA template for native huCOX-2 by overlap extension PCR and then subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO using BamHI and XhoI sites. Correct cDNA orientation and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant ovCOX-1 cDNA and N-terminal His6 ovCOX-1 cDNA were subcloned into pIND (Invitrogen). cDNAs for huCOX-2, ovCOX-1, and N-terminal His6 muCOX-2 were subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH/3T3 fibroblasts at early passage (<6 passages) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. To induce COX-2 expression, the cells were first made quiescent by serum starvation for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine calf serum and thereafter treated with DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS for 4 h. RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. To stimulate COX-2 expression, the cells were challenged with 200 ng/ml LPS for 12 h (30Kang Y.J. Wingerd B.A. Arakawa T. Smith W.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 8111-8122Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HEK293-derived cell lines stably expressing native or mutant COX constructs were generated using either the tetracycline-inducible and ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression systems (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Constructs that were expressed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter were native huCOX-2, G533A huCOX-2, N594A huCOX-2, del595-612 huCOX-2, His6 native muCOX-2, del602-612 huCOX-2, del607-612 huCOX-2, P607A/T608A huCOX-2, V609A huCOX-2, L610A huCOX-2, L611A huCOX-2, K612A huCOX-2, V591P T592G huCOX-2, ovCOX-1 UPSTRM8 huCOX-2, muCOX-2 UPSTRM8 huCOX-2, Sins595-612 huCOX-2, Sins597-612 huCOX-2, native ovCOX-1, ins594-612 ovCOX-1, ins594-612 (N594A) ovCOX-1, ins586-612 ovCOX-1, and ins586-612 (N594A) ovCOX-1. Native ovCOX-1, His6 native ovCOX-1, ins594-596 ovCOX-1, ins595-597 ovCOX-1, and ins594-601 ovCOX-1 constructs were expressed under the control of the ecdysone-inducible promoter. Stably transfected HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and the appropriate pharmacological reagents. Inducible expression was achieved by treatment with 10 μg/ml tetracycline or 10 μm ponasterone A (ecdys-one analog) for 24 h in normal culture medium. Protein Degradation following Drug or Fatty Acid Treatment—Quiescent 3T3 cells were serum-stimulated for 4 h and then treated with 50 μm cycloheximide (CHX) or 50 μm puromycin for different times in the presence or absence of 25 μm kifunensine (KIF), 20 μm AA, 100 μm flurbiprofen (FB; a nonspecific COX inhibitor), 20 μm NS-398 (a COX-2-specific inhibitor), or a combination of 20 μm AA and one of the following: 100 μm FB, 20 μm NS-398, or 20 μm MG132. Alternatively, after serum stimulation, the cells were treated for different times with 50 μm CHX or 50 μm puromycin in the presence or absence of 10 μm A23187 or 10 μm bradykinin with or without 100 μm FB, 20 μm NS-398, or 20 μm MG132. RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were challenged with 200 ng/ml LPS for 12 h and then treated with 50 μm CHX in the presence or absence of 50 μm KIF. HEK293 cells stably and inducibly expressing wild-type or mutant cyclooxygenase constructs were grown to ∼80% confluence, serum-starved for 24 h, and then treated with 10 μg/ml tetracycline or 10 μm ponasterone A in complete culture medium to induce expression. Afterward, the cells were incubated for various times with 50 μm puromycin to block translation in the absence or presence of AA, KIF, MG132, and/or FB. To examine the effect of inhibitors of COX, proteasome, lysosome, and ER to Golgi trafficking on COX-2 protein degradation, cells expressing native huCOX-2, del594-612 huCOX-2, or N594A huCOX-2 were treated for 4 h with 50 μm puromycin with or without AA in combination with one of the following: 20 μm MG132, 100 μm flurbiprofen, 50 μm (S)-flurbiprofen, 50 μm (R)-flurbiprofen, 20 μm NS-398, 50 μm leupeptin, 25 μm E64, or 5 μg/ml brefeldin A. Enyzmatic Deglycosylation—For complete deglycosylation, HEK293 whole cell lysates were denatured by boiling in NuPAGE SDS sample loading buffer (Invitrogen) and then treated for at least 12 h with endoglycosidase H at a concentration of 0.4 milliunits/μl. Western Transfer Blotting—After the appropriate treatments, NIH/3T3, RAW 264.7, and HEK293 cells were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication. Radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was also used for cell lysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The NuPAGE system (Invitrogen) was used to resolve the proteins in the whole cell lysates on a 7% Tris acetate polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotting was performed with the appropriate primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunodetection was performed using the Western Lighting Chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to x-ray film. Densitometry analysis was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Antibodies for Western Analysis—A previously generated (31Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), peptide-specific, polyclonal primary antibody for muCOX-2 against the epitope Ser-598 to Lys-612 was used in the current study to detect muCOX-2 expressed in NIH/3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells. Peptide-specific, polyclonal primary antibodies for ovCOX-1 and huCOX-2 were synthesized by Covance Research Products against the following epitopes: Leu-272 to Gln-283 of ovCOX-1 and Pro-583 to Asn-594 of huCOX-2. A polyclonal antibody raised against whole muCOX-2, which also specifically detects native huCOX-2, was used to immunoblot for the mutants V591P T592G huCOX-2, ovCOX-1 UPSTRM8 huCOX-2, and muCOX-2 UPSTRM8 huCOX-2. Cyclooxygenase Inactivation Assay—Cultured Flp-In T-Rex HEK293 cells stably expressing native ovCOX-1 or His6 muCOX-2 were incubated for 10 min with different concentrations of AA ranging from 2.5 to 50 μm. After incubation, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, buffer containing 5 mm EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture and lysed by sonication. Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by BCA assay. COX activity assays were performed at 37 °C by monitoring the initial rate of oxygen uptake using an oxygen electrode as described previously (18Mbonye U.R. Wada M. Rieke C.J. Tang H.Y. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35770-35778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by adding cell lysate to the assay chamber containing 3 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenol, 5 μm hematin, and 100 μm AA. In some cases, microsomes were prepared from the cell lysates and used to quantify the synthesis of radiolabeled prostaglandins from [1-14C]AA by radio thin layer chromatography using procedures described in detail previously (32Wada M. DeLong C.J. Hong Y. Rieke C.J. Song I. Sidhu S. Warnock S. Schmaie A.H. Yokoyama C. Smyth E.M. Wilson S.J. FitzGerald G.A. Garavito R.M. Sui D.X. Regan J.W. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Effects of Mutations of 19-aa on COX-2 Degradation—The domain structures of COX-1 and COX-2 and the sequences of the C termini of native and mutant COXs are shown in Fig. 1A. We have previously shown that the Asn-594 glycosylation site is necessary, but not sufficient, to enable proteasomal degradation of COX-2 (18Mbonye U.R. Wada M. Rieke C.J. Tang H.Y. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35770-35778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Inserting the COX-2 19-aa cassette near the C terminus of ovCOX-1 also yields a mutant ins594-612 ovCOX-1 that is unstable (t½ ∼ 3 h) (18Mbonye U.R. Wada M. Rieke C.J. Tang H.Y. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35770-35778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, simply inserting a glycosylation site near the C terminus of ovCOX-1 (ins594-596 ovCOX-1 or ins595-597 ovCOX-1) does not destabilize this COX isoform (Fig. 1, B and C). Both ins594-596 ovCOX-1 and ins595-597 ovCOX-1 are variably glycosylated (Fig. 1C) (18Mbonye U.R. Wada M. Rieke C.J. Tang H.Y. Dewitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35770-35778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Inhibition of protein synthesis causes a time-dependent accumulation of the more highly glycosylated forms of these two mutants, suggesting that glycosylation occurs post-translationally at the additional N-glycosylation site (Fig. 1C). These observations indicate that C-terminal N-glycosylation of ins594-596 ovCOX-1 or ins595-597 ovCOX-1 is insufficient to promote their degradation and suggest that in the case of COX-2, a segment of the 19-aa in addition to the Asn-594 glycosylation sequence is needed for degradation to occur.FIGURE 1The C-terminal end of the 19-aa is essential for COX-2 protein degradation. A, domain structures of COX-1 and COX-2 highlighting sites of N-glycosylation. Asn-594 of COX-2, the first amino acid of the 19-aa, is variably glycosylated. The Asn-594 glycosylation site is underlined, and residues of 19-aa that are conserved in humans, mice, sheep, and rats are indicated in gray. B, amino acid sequences of the C termini of cyclooxygenase constructs that were stably transfected into HEK293 cells. The underlined sequence is the consensus N-glycosylation site at the start of the COX-2 19-aa cassette. The C-terminal sequences of native huCOX-2, native ovCOX-1, ins594-612 ovCOX-1, and ins594-612 (N594A) ovCOX-1 are included for comparison. The protein half-life (t½) of each mutant is also shown. C, HEK293 cells stably and inducibly expressing two of the constructs shown in B were grown to ∼80% confluence, subjected to serum starvation for 24 h, and then treated with the appropriate inducing agent (tetracycline or ponasterone A) for 24 h. Puromycin (50 μm) was then added to block translation, and at the indicated times, protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting and densitometry. The Western blotting results for each mutant are representative of at least two separate experiments from which protein half-lives were determined. D, HEK293 cells stably and inducibly expressing COX-2 variants having mutations in the 19-aa were analyzed as in C. E, densitometry analyses of the degradation of the mutants shown in D used to determine the protein half-lives. Densitometry measurements of V609A huCOX-2, L610A huCOX-2, and L611A huCOX-2 are based on three separate experiments. Densitometry measurements of P607A/T608A huCOX-2 and K612A huCOX-2 are based on two separate experiments. The degradation profile of huCOX-2, shown with the solid line, is included for comparison.

The data on rates of protein degradation are summarized in Fig. 1B. Two C-terminal deletion mutants of huCOX-2 (i.e. del602-612 huCOX-2 and del607-612 huCOX-2) and an insertion mutant of ovCOX-1 (i.e. ins594-601 ovCOX-1) that has the region of 19-aa identical to that of del602-612 huCOX-2 were not degraded at a detectable rate (Fig. 1B). Thus, removal of the last 6 residues of 19-aa prevents COX-2 degradation. The fact that COX-2 degradation was prevented by trimming the 19-aa raised the possibility that it was the length of the 19-aa cassette rather than its primary structure that was important in COX-2 degradation. To test this possibility, we prepared two mutants of COX-2 whose 19-aa sequences had been scrambled (Fig. 1B). Sins597-612 huCOX-2 has an intact Asn-594 glycosylation site, but the rest of the 19-aa has been scrambled. Sins595-612huCOX-2 is not only mutated at Asn-594 but also has a randomized version of the remainder of the 19-aa. As summarized in Fig. 1B, both mutants were much more stable (t½ > 24 h) than native huCOX-2 (data not shown). These results suggested that there is primary structure information within the C-terminal 16-amino acid segment of 19-aa, perhaps within the last six residues of the insertion, that is essential for mediating COX-2 protein degradation. To identify which of the last 6 amino acids of 19-aa were important for COX-2 degradation, we performed alanine scanning"
https://openalex.org/W2075235384,"Activation of NFkappaB is a fundamental cellular event central to all inflammatory diseases. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ameliorates both acute and chronic inflammation in a multitude of organ systems through modulating NFkappaB activity; nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanism remains uncertain. Here we report that HGF through inactivation of GSK3beta suppresses NFkappaB p65 phosphorylation specifically at position Ser-468. The Ser-468 of RelA/p65 situates in a GSK3beta consensus motif and could be directly phosphorylated by GSK3beta both in vivo and in vitro, signifying Ser-468 of RelA/p65 as a putative substrate for GSK3beta. In addition, the C terminus of RelA/p65 harbors a highly conserved domain homologue of the consensus docking sequence for GSK3beta. Moreover, this domain was required for efficient phosphorylation of Ser-468 and was indispensable for the physical interaction between RelA/p65 and GSK3beta. HGF substantially intercepted this interaction by inactivating GSK3beta. Functionally, phosphorylation of Ser-468 of RelA/p65 was required for the induced expression of a particular subset of proinflammatory NFkappaB-dependent genes. Diminished phosphorylation at Ser-468 by HGF resulted in a gene-specific inhibition of these genes' expression. The action of HGF on proinflammatory NFkappaB activation was consistently mimicked by a selective GSK3beta inhibitor or GSK3beta knockdown by RNA interference but largely abrogated in cells expressing the mutant uninhibitable GSK3beta. Collectively, our findings suggest that HGF has a potent suppressive effect on NFkappaB activation, which is mediated by GSK3beta, an important signaling transducer controlling RelA/p65 phosphorylation specificity and directing the transcription of selective proinflammatory cytokines implicated in inflammatory kidney disease."

https://openalex.org/W2053992332,"The accumulation of intracellular protein deposits as inclusion bodies is the common pathological hallmark of most age-related neurodegenerative disorders including polyglutamine diseases. Appearance of aggregates of the misfolded mutant disease proteins suggest that cells are unable to efficiently degrade them, and failure of clearance leads to the severe disturbances of the cellular quality control system. Recently, the quality control ubiquitin ligase CHIP has been shown to suppress the polyglutamine protein aggregation and toxicity. Here we have identified another ubiquitin ligase, called E6-AP, which is able to promote the proteasomal degradation of misfolded polyglutamine proteins and suppress the polyglutamine protein aggregation and polyglutamine protein-induced cell death. E6-AP interacts with the soluble misfolded polyglutamine protein and associates with their aggregates in both cellular and transgenic mouse models. Partial knockdown of E6-AP enhances the rate of aggregate formation and cell death mediated by the polyglutamine protein. Finally, we have demonstrated the up-regulation of E6-AP in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells as well as cells exposed to proteasomal stress. These findings suggest that E6-AP is a critical mediator of the neuronal response to misfolded polyglutamine proteins and represents a potential therapeutic target in the polyglutamine diseases."

The full inhibition occurred within 3 h following introduction of mannose and did not involve down-regulation of hyaluronan synthase (Has1–3) mRNA. Following introduction of mannose, there was an ∼50% reduction in the cellular concentration of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines (UDP-HexNAc, i.e. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine). On the other hand, 2 mm glucosamine in the culture medium increased UDP-HexNAc content, stimulated hyaluronan secretion, and negated the effect of mannose, supporting the notion that the inhibition by mannose on hyaluronan synthesis was because of down-regulated UDP-HexNAc content.

There is also evidence for post-transcriptional factors like HAS protein phosphorylation that may contribute to the rate of hyaluronan synthesis (31Bourguignon L.Y. Gilad E. Peyrollier K. J. Biol.

The expression of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) dehydrogenase (UGDH), which converts UDP-Glc to UDP-GlcUA, is often up-regulated at the same time as hyaluronan production increases (33Pitsillides A.A. Wilkinson L.S. Mehdizadeh S. Bayliss M.T. Edwards J.C. Int. J. Exp.

This suggests that the rate of hyaluronan synthesis may also be regulated by the level of HAS substrate concentration.

The pool of UDP-HexNAc is generally the largest among the cellular nucleotide sugars. For example, UDP-GlcNAc is 3–7 times more abundant than that of UDP-GlcUA (36Sweeney C. Mackintosh D. Mason R.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There is an equilibrium between UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), mediated by UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (37Piller F. Hanlon M.H. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10774-10778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-GalNAc ratio of ∼3:1 (36Sweeney C. Mackintosh D. Mason R.M. Biochem.

Hexosamine biosynthesis is started by glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferases (GFAT1 and GFAT2), which are considered as the rate-limiting enzymes in this pathway, and use glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate as substrates to make glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN-6P). GlcN-6P is further converted to glucosamine 1-phosphate (GlcN-1P), acetylated, and used for the production of UDP-GlcNAc. An estimated 2% of total intracellular glucose flux goes to hexosamine biosynthesis (39Schleicher E.D. Weigert C. Kidney Int. 2000; 77: S13-S18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway has received wide interest, because it may act as a cellular glucose sensor and control cellular energy metabolism, being associated with insulin resistance and diabetes (39Schleicher E.D. Weigert C. Kidney Int. 2000; 77: S13-S18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the influences of cellular UDP-HexNAc fluctuations on glycoconjugates have received less attention (40Cayli A. Hirschmann F. Wirth M. Hauser H. Wagner R. Biotechnol.

In this study we present evidence that despite its relatively high cellular content, the UDP-HexNAc level influences the synthesis of hyaluronan, and that depletion of either UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GlcUA alone can limit the rate of hyaluronan synthesis, and that mannose through its ability to decrease UDP-HexNAc is a novel, potentially useful inhibitor of hyaluronan production. Cell Culture—Rat epidermal keratinocytes (REKs) (42Baden H.P. Kubilus J. J. Investig.

Cells were passaged twice a week at 1:5 split ratio using 0.05% trypsin, 0.2% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Bichrom AG, Berlin, Germany). For biochemical assays cells were grown close to confluency in 6-, 12- or 24-well plates and then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, without glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% serum, l-glutamine, the antibiotics, and 5 mm glucose.

Enzyme-linked Sorbent Assay (ELSA) for Hyaluronan—Approximately 60,000 REK cells were plated on 24-well plates and cultured for 2 days. The medium was then changed, and appropriate concentrations of hexoses were added, followed by 6- or 24-h incubations. Hyaluronan content in the culture medium was measured with a sandwich-type ELSA, as described (11Hiltunen E.L. Anttila M. Kultti A. Ropponen K. Penttinen J. Yliskoski M. Kuronen A.T. Juhola M.

Ninety six-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 1 μg/ml of the hyaluronan-binding complex of the cartilage aggrecan G1 domain and link protein (HABC).

Hyaluronan standards (1–50 ng/ml) and samples diluted into 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS were incubated in the wells for 1 h at 37 °C. After washes, the wells were sequentially incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated HABC (bHABC) and horseradish peroxidase/streptavidin (1:20,000 in PBS, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h each at 37 °C, followed by 10 min of incubation at room temperature with the TMB substrate solution (0.01% 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) and 0.005% H2O2 in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 1.5 mm citric acid buffer). The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbances were measured at 450 nm. Histochemical Demonstration of Hyaluronan—The cells cultured on 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Napperville, IL) were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate buffer for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with bHABC (3 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C (43Tammi R. Ågren U.M. Tuhkanen A.L. Tammi M. Prog. Histochem.

The cells were mounted using Supermount (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA). The specificity of the hyaluronan staining was confirmed by pretreatment with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative RT-PCR—For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from monolayer REK cultures with EUROzol (Euroclone). The samples were DNase-treated with TURBO DNA-free™ (Ambion, Austin, TX), quantitated with a spectrophotometer, and equal amounts of RNA were taken for the reverse transcriptase reaction. Quantitative PCR was performed in a MX3000P thermal cycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with Absolute™ MAX two-step quantitative RT-PCR SYBR® Green kit (ABgene, Epsom Surrey, UK), with the specific primers shown in supplemental Table 1. Fold inductions were calculated using the formula 2-(ΔΔCt), where ΔΔCt is the ΔCt (treatment) - ΔCt (control). ΔCt is Ct Has1–3, Gfat1, GPI - Ct Arpo, and Ct is the cycle in which the detection threshold is crossed. Quantitation of Glycosaminoglycans with Dual Labeling—100,000 cells were plated onto 12-well plates and cultured until nearly confluent. The medium was removed, and 0.45 ml of fresh medium containing 0 or 20 mm mannose was added to the wells. The radiolabels 200 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1000 μCi/ml [35S]SO4 (Amersham Biosciences) were added in 50 μl of medium at 0, 3, 6, or 9 h after the medium change, and incubated a further 3 h before samples were harvested, as described (44Tammi R.

Briefly, the labeling medium, trypsin solution, and pelleted cells were analyzed by chromatographic separation of hyaluronan- and chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides following enzymatic digestion with hyaluronidase and chondroitinase and assessment of the specific activity of cellular [3H]hexosamines (45Tammi R.H.

UDP-hexose Analysis with Ion Pairing HPLC-MS/MS—Cells seeded 2 days earlier and treated with various effectors for the indicated times were scraped off in an ice bath, pelleted at 4 °C, and washed with cold PBS. Cold acetonitrile and water were sequentially added to the cell pellet to extract the sugar nucleotides and precipitate proteins. Alternatively, cells on plates were directly extracted with acetonitrile. Samples were centrifuged at 13000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was evaporated using a vacuum centrifuge. Prior to analysis, samples were dissolved in 150 μl of MilliQ water containing 5 μm AppCp (Sigma M7510) as an internal standard. The ion pairing HPLC-MS/MS measurements were carried out with a Finnigan Surveyor MS pump and autosampler and a Finnigan LTQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA). The separation was accomplished with a Gemini C18 reversed phase column (50 × 2.0 mm, 5 μm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Injection volume was 45 μl. An eluent system of 20 mm dimethylhexylamine formate (Sigma) with pH adjusted to 6.8 (eluent A) and 80% methanol containing 2 mm dimethylhexylamine formate (eluent B) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min was used. The gradient was 2 min of eluent A, 0–100% of eluent B in 3 min, 100% eluent B for 4 min, and subsequent stabilization of the column with eluent A for 4 min. Electrospray and negative ion mode were used for the ionization of the molecules. Quantitation was based on multiple reaction monitoring of the characteristic fragment ions as follows: m/z 579 → 403 for UDP-GlcA (Sigma), m/z 606 → 385 for UDP-HexNAc (Sigma), and m/z 504 → 406 for internal standard AppCp. The isomers UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc were not separated from each other in the chromatography and were quantified together. Migration and Proliferation Assays—For migration analysis, 120,000 REK cells were seeded on 24-well plates coated with collagen IV (5 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences). After 24 h, an artificial wound was introduced with a pipette tip to the cell layer. Fresh medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and containing the factors to be examined were changed, and 6 h later the cultures were fixed with methanol. The cell-free area was measured immediately after the scraping and 6 h later using an Olympus CK2 inverted phase contrast microscope (Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), a Panasonic Ww CD 130-L video camera (Matsushita Electric Works, Tokyo, Japan), and NIH Image software. The newly covered wound area was calculated and converted to average migration distance from the wound edge (2Pienimäki J.P. Rilla K. Fulop C. Sironen R.K. Karvinen S. Pasonen S. Lammi M.J. Tammi R. Hascall V.C. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20428-20435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For the proliferation analysis, 60,000 REK cells per well were seeded on 24-well plates, and after 4 h the appropriate concentrations of mannose were added to the cells. The media containing mannose were replaced each day. Cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA at 1–5 days following plating and counted with hemocytometer. Protein Biosynthesis Assay—Nearly confluent cultures were changed into a methionine-free medium (Invitrogen) with 0.1 mCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (GE Healthcare). After 6-h incubations without additives (control), in the presence of 20 mm mannose or 2 mm GlcN, proteins were precipitated in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Results were presented using the ratio of precipitated label to total radioactivity. Mannose Inhibits Hyaluronan Synthesis in Keratinocyte Cultures—The common hexoses glucose, galactose, mannose, and fructose were added at 20 mm final concentrations to the basal culture medium of REKs for 24 h; the incubation media were collected, and secreted hyaluronan was analyzed with an ELSA (Fig. 1A). Although the other hexoses had relatively little effect (Fig. 1A), mannose caused a dose-dependent inhibition, reaching 45% with 15 mm concentration and 54% reduction at 20 mm (Fig. 1B). Cell-associated hyaluronan was also reduced by mannose, as shown by cytochemical staining of hyaluronan with a specific probe. After a 4-h treatment with 20 mm mannose, the cell-associated signal of hyaluronan was decreased (Fig. 1D), as compared with controls (Fig. 1C), and became even weaker after a 24-h treatment (Fig. 1E). Following a shift to mannose-free medium, the cultures showed complete restoration of hyaluronan synthesis (data not shown). The Inhibition of Hyaluronan Synthesis Is Rapid—To obtain more information on the processes that lead to reduced hyaluronan production, we examined hyaluronan synthesis at different times following introduction of 20 mm mannose. Metabolic labeling in 3-h pulses over a 12-h period was used to monitor the rate of hyaluronan synthesis (Fig. 2A). The synthesis of hyaluronan was slightly stimulated by the change of fresh medium, as shown by the higher synthesis levels in control cultures during the 3–12-h time period (Fig. 2A), a finding consistent with earlier data on these cells (2Pienimäki J.P. Rilla K. Fulop C. Sironen R.K. Karvinen S. Pasonen S. Lammi M.J. Tammi R. Hascall V.C. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20428-20435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The inhibition occurred almost immediately after introduction of mannose, because the decrease in the 0–3-h labeling window was as large as during the later labeling periods (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the synthesis of chondroitin sulfates was not affected until in the 3–6-h labeling window and thereafter (Fig. 2B). The Inhibition Does Not Involve Suppression of Has Expression—Alterations in hyaluronan synthesis in REK cells have often been associated with rapid changes in Has mRNA levels (2Pienimäki J.P. Rilla K. Fulop C. Sironen R.K. Karvinen S. Pasonen S. Lammi M.J. Tammi R. Hascall V.C. Tammi M.I. J. Biol.

Real time RT-PCR was therefore used to check possible contribution of lower Has expression in the inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis. Cells treated with 20 mm mannose and analyzed for the levels of Has1, Has2, and Has3 showed no decrease as compared with controls (data not shown). Fructose, galactose, and glucose did not have any marked effect on the expression of the three Has levels (data not shown). The early impact on hyaluronan synthesis without corresponding down-regulation of Has expression indicates that mannose influences a step in HAS regulation beyond transcription. Mannose Reduces UDP-HexNAc Pool Size in Keratinocytes—A previously described hyaluronan synthesis inhibitor (4-MU), with an efficiency and selectivity closely resembling that of mannose (47Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol.

Kojima K. Takagaki K. Endo M. Kannagi R. Ito M. Maruo Y. Sato H. Yasuda T. Mita S. Kimata K. Itano N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33281-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because the HAS enzymes use UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc as building blocks to construct the hyaluronan chain, the concentrations of the nucleotide sugars were measured as candidates for the inhibitory effect. Mannose reduced the UDP-HexNAc pool in a dose-dependent way, with the maximum decrease of ∼50%, whereas the UDP-GlcUA pool size was increased (Fig. 3A). Other hexoses like glucose, galactose, and fructose did not cause any marked changes in the intracellular pools of UDP-HexNAc or UDP-GlcUA (data not shown). The reduction in UDP-HexNAc had occurred by 1.5 h following introduction of 20 mm mannose (Fig. 3B), consistent wi"
https://openalex.org/W2013679113,"Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can self-renew in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Several essential transcription factors have been identified for the self-renewal of mouse ES cells, including STAT3, Oct-3/4, and Nanog. The molecular mechanism of ES cell self-renewal, however, is not fully understood. In the present study, we identified Eed, a core component of Polycomb repressive complex 2, as a downstream molecule of STAT3 and Oct-3/4. Artificial activation of STAT3 resulted in increased expression of Eed, whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of STAT3 or suppression of Oct-3/4 expression led to down-regulation of Eed. Reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that STAT3 and Oct-3/4 directly bind to the promoter region of Eed, suggesting that Eed is a common target molecule of STAT3 and Oct-3/4. We also found that suppression of STAT3, Oct-3/4, or Eed causes induction of differentiation-associated genes as well as loss of Lys27-trimethylated histone H3 at the promoter regions of the differentiation-associated genes. Suppression of STAT3 and Oct-3/4 also resulted in the absence of Eed at the promoter regions. These results suggest that STAT3 and Oct-3/4 maintain silencing of differentiation-associated genes through up-regulation of Eed in self-renewing ES cells.

Kauman M.H. Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6476) Google Scholar, 2Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4325) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified several essential transcription factors for the self-renewal of mouse ES cells, such as Oct-3/4, Nanog, and STAT3 (3Niwa H. Development. 2007; 134: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Oct-3/4 is a POU-family transcription factor involved in inner cell mass formation (4Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Scholer H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2687) Google Scholar). A precise level of Oct-3/4 expression is required for maintenance of ES cells: repression of Oct-3/4 leads to trophectodermal differentiation, and overexpression of Oct-3/4 stimulates differentiation, mainly to extraembryonic endoderm (5Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). Nanog is a homeodomain transcription factor whose overexpression sustains ES cell self-renewal (6Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2664) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the nanog gene results in ES cell differentiation, primarily along the primitive endoderm lineage, suggesting that Nanog prevents ES cells from endoderm differentiation (7Mitsui K.

The pluripotency and self-renewal of mouse ES cells can be maintained by the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF stimulation leads to the activation of transcription factor STAT3. Previously, using a fusion protein consisting of STAT3 and the ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor (STAT3ER), we demonstrated that the self-renewal of ES cells can be maintained by activation of STAT3ER with a synthetic estrogen receptor ligand, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT), even in the absence of LIF (8Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4261-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Another study showed that expression of a dominant negative mutant of STAT3 causes differentiation of ES cells (9Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the activation of STAT3 is essential and sufficient for the self-renewal of mouse ES cells. Despite having found the essential transcription factors, the molecular mechanism behind ES cell self-renewal is poorly understood. When ES cells undergo differentiation, chromatin modification changes dynamically, and expression of a set of differentiation-associated genes is induced, suggesting that in self-renewing ES cells, the expression of the differentiation-associated genes is suppressed, at least partially, through chromatin modification (10Meshorer E. Misteli T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). It is well known that the N-terminal domain of histone is subject to multiple post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and sumoylation (11Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 12Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2682) Google Scholar). These modifications are believed to influence the transition between the open and compacted chromatin structures and to correlate with the activated or repressed status of gene promoters. It is easy to speculate, therefore, that the essential transcription factors in ES cell self-renewal suppress differentiation-associated genes through regulation of histone modification. In this study, we searched for a molecule that would regulate histone modification in self-renewing ES cells, identifying embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) as a downstream molecule of STAT3 and Oct-3/4. Eed is a major component of Polycomb repressive complex (PRC)-2, which is involved in methylation of histone H3 at Lys27. We found that both STAT3 and Oct-3/4 directly bind to the promoter region of Eed and regulate its expression at the transcriptional level. We also found that suppression of STAT3, Oct-3/4, or Eed triggers induction of differentiation marker genes and loss of Lys27-trimethylated histone H3 at their promoter regions. Suppression of STAT3 and Oct-3/4 also resulted in disappearance of Eed from the promoter regions. These results suggest that STAT3 and Oct-3/4 stimulate the expression of the eed gene to silence the expression of differentiation-associated genes in self-renewing ES cells. Cell Culture—ES cell lines A3-1 (13Azuma S. Toyoda Y. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1991; 37: 37-43Crossref Google Scholar), ZHBTc4 (5Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4261-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acid (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), 1× nucleoside mix (Chemicon), 40 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 0.1% mouse LIF, produced as conditioned media from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing LIF. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid Construction—The mammalian expression vector pCAG-IP was constructed by inserting the sequence of internal ribosomal entry site and the puromycin-resistance gene into pCAGGS (14Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar, 15Yoshida-Koide U. Matsuda T. Saikawa K. Nakanuma Y. Yokota T. Asashima M. Koide H. Biochem.

For knockdown experiments, target sequences for RNA interference of Oct-3/4 (5′-AGCCTTAAGAACATGTGTA-3′) and Nanog (5′-GCATCGAATTCTGGGAACG-3′) were introduced into small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vectors, pSi-puro (16Akagi T. Usuda M. Matsuda T. Ko M.S. Niwa H. Asano M. Koide H. Yokota T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were isolated from ES cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and converted to cDNAs by Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT)12–18 primers (Amersham Biosciences). PCR products were subjected to 1.5% agarose electrophoresis gel. Primers used in this study are listed in Table S1. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (5 μg) was separated by electrophoresis in denaturing 1.0% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), followed by UV cross-linking. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled probe in QuikHyb (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 68 °C for 2 h. The membrane was washed in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C, and radiolabeled bands were visualized by a BAS-2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). As probes, we used a 337-bp cDNA portion of Suz12 and full-length cDNAs of Eed, Ezh2, Oct-3/4, Nanog, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Luciferase Reporter Assay—By using genomic DNA of A3-1 cells as a template, a 2.6-kb fragment of the mouse Eed promoter was cloned by PCR with 5′-CGCACGCGTTTAAAAGGTACAACAGCATG-3′ and 5′-CGCCTCGAGAACGAAAGTCTGTGGCCTGG-3′ and inserted into the MluI and XhoI sites of pGL2-basic (Promega) to obtain pGL2-Eed(–2600/–13). To generate pGL2-Eed(–2220/–13), a 2.2-kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR with 5′-CGCACGCGTTATTCATAGAGTTCACCCTGG-3′ and 5′-CGCCTCGAGAACGAAAGTCTGTGGCCTGG-3′ using pGL2-Eed(–2600/–13) as a template and inserted into pGL2-basic. Plasmids pGL2-Eed(–1400/–13) and pGL2-Eed(–400/–13) were constructed by removing the MluI-NcoI fragment and the MluI-KpnI fragment from pGL2-Eed(–2600/–13), respectively. Mutations were introduced to pGL2-Eed(–2600/–13) by PCR with 5′-GAGGAGATGTATGCTCAAATCTTATTCATA-3′ and 5′-TATGAATAAGATTTGAGCATACATCTCCTC-3′ (for STAT3 mt), 5′-TGATTGGCTGTACTTCCTGAAAGGGCTGGT-3′ and 5′-ACCAGCCCTTTCAGGAAGTACAGCCAATCA-3′ (for Oct mt1), and 5′-GATATCAGAGCGTATCCTCCAGTATTGATA-3′ and 5′-TATCAATACTGGAGGATACGCTCTGATATC-3′ (for Oct mt2). Using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), ES cells (1 × 105 cells) in a 6-cm dish were transfected with various combinations of plasmids. Two days after transfection, ES cells were harvested and lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) and a Luminescencer AB-2200 (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Nuclear Extract and Western Blot Analysis—To prepare nuclear extracts, ES cells were harvested and incubated in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and an inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate) for 15 min at 4 °C. Nonidet P-40 was then added at a final concentration of 0.6%. Samples were mixed vigorously and centrifuged. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol, and the inhibitor mixture, sonicated, and centrifuged to save supernatant. A portion of lysate (50 μg of protein) was subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against Eed (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), H3K27triMe (Upstate Biotechnology), lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and Myc epitope (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Establishment of Eed Conditional Knock-out ES Cells—The 15-kb fragment running from 6 kb upstream of the first exon to 0.3 kb downstream of the fourth exon was isolated by PCR from a Lambda FIXII library (Stratagene) and subcloned into the SalI site of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). Two drug resistance cassette vectors, pGT1.8 IRES-hygro-pA2 and pGT1.8 IRES-β-Geo-pA, were digested with SalI, and the fragment containing a drug resistance gene was cloned into the SwaI site of the pBluescript II KS carrying the 15-kb DNA fragment to generate pBS-Eed-IRES-Hygro and pBS-Eed-IRES-β-Geo, respectively. To construct a tetracycline-inducible expression vector pTRE-tTA2p-myc, we first constructed pCAGIP-tTA2 by transferring the coding sequence of tTA2 from ptTA2 (Clontech) to pCAG-IP. The TRE sequence of pTRE-myc (Clontech), the sequence of the Myc epitope tag, and the rabbit β-globin poly(A) sequence of pCAGGS were then combined and inserted into the SspI site of pCAGIP-tTA2 to produce pTRE-tTA2p-myc, to which each cDNA for the Eed isoform was inserted. To establish Eed conditional knock-out ES cells, linearized pBS-Eed-IRES-Hygro was introduced into A3-1 cells by electroporation (240 V, 500 microfarads). Cells were selected with 300 μg/ml hygromycin and subjected to genomic Southern blot analysis. Two of 11 hygromycin-resistant clones were Eed+/– ES cell clones. Tetracycline-inducible vector of each Eed isoform was then transfected into Eed+/– ES cells. After selection with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin, cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Eed+/– ES cells that express Eed in a Tet-dependent manner were electroporated with linearized pBS-Eed-IRES-β-Geo and then selected with 375 μg/ml G418. Genomic Southern blot analyses revealed that, in each case, 1–2% of clones were Eed conditional knock-out ES cell clones. Genomic Southern Blot Analysis—A 670-bp probe was isolated by PCR with 5′-GACCCAAACCTTCTCCTGT-3′ and 5′-GTGGCTACTCTGGGATACA-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. Isolated genomic DNA was digested with ScaI and subjected to 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was soaked in 0.25 m HCl and neutralized in 0.4 n NaOH. The separated genomic DNAs in the gel were then transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane. After UV cross-linking, the membrane was hybridized overnight with 32P-labeled probe in QuikHyb at 68 °C. The membrane was washed in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C, and radiolabeled bands were visualized with BAS-2000. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—For the ChIP assay, 1–5 × 106 ES cells were treated with DMEM containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature for cross-linking, which was stopped by a 10-min incubation with 1.5 m glycine. After washing twice, the cells were resuspended in 300 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) by pipetting and kept on ice for 20 min. The chromatin was then sonicated into fragments with an average length of 0.5–3 kb. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were diluted with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.1% Nonidet P-40, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). The extracts were precleaned by incubation with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 6 h. The supernatants were mixed with antibodies for 16 h and incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads for 12 h. The incubated beads were then washed once with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2% SDS) containing 150 mm NaCl, once with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and once with LiCl wash solution (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The washed beads were incubated in elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) at 65 °C for 12 h, followed by phenol/chloroform treatment and ethanol precipitation. ChIP DNA was amplified by standard PCR using Taq polymerase (Ampliqon III, Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) with the primers listed in Table S2. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extract or recombinant protein was incubated in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 2.5% glycerol) for 30 min at room temperature with 32P-labeled DNA probe and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), with or without a 100-fold molar excess of cold competitors. Samples were separated on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, and radiolabeled bands were visualized with BAS-2000. DNA probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Oligonucleotides used were 5′-AGATTTCTGATAAAATCTTA-3′ and 5′-TAAGATTTTATCAGAAATCT-3′ (for STAT3 probe/STAT3 competitor), 5′-AGATGTATGCTCAAATCTTA-3′ and 5′-TAAGATTTGAGCATACATCT-3′ (for STAT3 mutant competitor), 5′-TCAGAGAGGAGCATCCAGTA-3′ and 5′-TACTGGATGCTCCTCTCTGA-3′ (for Oct-3/4 probe/Oct-3/4 competitor), and 5′-TCAGAGCGTATCCTCCAGTA-3′ and 5′-TACTGGAGGATACGCTCTGA-3′ (for Oct-3/4 mutant competitor). To prepare nuclear extracts, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCAG-IP, pCAGIP-STAT3, or pCAGIP-STAT3ER using Lipofectamine 2000 and cultured for 2 days. For LIF stimulation, transfected cells were cultured for 1 day in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, starved for 1 day in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and stimulated with recombinant human LIF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. For experiments using STAT3ER, the nuclear extract was incubated with 1 μm 4HT for 30 min at room temperature before the DNA binding reaction. A fusion protein between Oct-3/4 and maltose-binding protein (MBP-Oct-3/4) was produced by Escherichia coli transformed with pMAL-c2-FLAG-Oct3 and purified with amylose resin according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mammalian expression vectors, pCAGIP-STAT3 and pCAGIP-STAT3ER, were constructed by inserting cDNAs of wild-type STAT3 and STAT3ER into pCAG-IP, respectively. A bacterial expression vector pMAL-c2-FLAG-Oct3 was constructed by inserting cDNA of FLAG-tagged mouse Oct-3/4 to the EcoRI site of pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). Identification of Eed as a Common Downstream Molecule of STAT3 and Oct-3/4—We previously found that activation of STAT3 is sufficient to maintain self-renewal in mouse ES cells (8Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4261-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). This finding encouraged us to search for a molecule(s) that would regulate histone modification downstream of STAT3. DNA chip analysis using STAT3ER-expressing ES cells identified many possible targets of STAT3. One of them was a Polycomb group protein, Eed. When we examined the expression of Eed in ES cells, the amount of Eed protein was reduced by removal of LIF, an upstream molecule of STAT3 (Fig. 1A). We thus performed Northern blot analysis to examine whether this reduction occurs at the transcriptional level. When ES cells were allowed to differentiate upon LIF withdrawal, the level of Eed mRNA decreased (57 ± 7.5% on day 2, 28 ± 10% on day 4, and 31 ± 15% on day 6, n = 3) (Fig. 1B), suggesting that LIF regulates Eed expression at the transcriptional level. In contrast, mRNA levels of the other PRC2 components, Ezh2 (enhancer of zeste 2) and Suz12 (suppressor of zeste 12), did not diminish even after 6-day depletion of LIF. To confirm that Eed is a downstream molecule of STAT3, we examined the effect of STAT3ER and dominant negative mutant of STAT3 (dnSTAT3) on Eed expression. In agreement with DNA chip analysis, the expression level of Eed did increase in ES cells expressing STAT3ER when cultured with 4HT (Fig. 1C). Ectopic expression of dnSTAT3, on the other hand, resulted in down-regulation of Eed (Fig. 1D). These results suggested that the expression of Eed is controlled by STAT3 in ES cells. We next examined the relationship of Eed to Oct-3/4 and Nanog, other important transcription factors for ES cell self-renewal. To examine the involvement of Oct-3/4 in Eed expression, we used ZHBTc4 ES cells, in which tetracycline (Tet) stimulation leads to down-regulation of Oct-3/4 expression (5Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). ZHBTc4 ES cells were treated with or without Tet, and the expression levels of Eed and Oct-3/4 were determined. Consistent with a previous report (5Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar), Tet stimulation repressed the expression of Oct-3/4 in ZHBTc4 ES cells, and its expression was recovered by removal of Tet (Fig. 1E). In good correspondence with Oct-3/4 expression, the expression level of Eed was decreased by Tet stimulation and restored after Tet removal, suggesting that Eed is a downstream molecule of Oct-3/4 in ES cells. To find out whether Nanog is also involved in the regulation of Eed expression, we knocked down Nanog by RNA interference and examined its effect on Eed expression. Knockdown of Nanog resulted in induction of GATA4 and GATA6 (data not shown), as reported previously (7Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression level of Eed was not altered, regardless of down-regulation of Nanog (Fig. 1F), suggesting that Nanog is not a major regulator of Eed. However, we could not exclude the possibility that suppression of Nanog was not enough to influence Eed expression. STAT3 and Oct-3/4 Directly Bind to the Promoter Region of Eed—To clarify whether Eed is a direct target of STAT3 and Oct-3/4, we first performed a reporter assay. Since there are several putative binding sites for STAT3 and Oct-3/4 in a 2.6-kb upstream region (–2600/–13) of the eed gene, we cloned this region into a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the results of Northern blot analysis, either expression of dnSTAT3 or suppression of Oct-3/4 expression led to the reduction of promoter activity, whereas knockdown of Nanog had no effect (Fig. 2B). Moreover, combined expression of dnSTAT3 and Oct-3/4 siRNA resulted in further reduction of promoter activity. These results suggested that the 2.6-kb fragment contains the binding sites for STAT3 and Oct-3/4. To search for these sites in this fragment, we constructed three deleted mutants of the promoter (–2220/–13, –1400/–13, and –400/–13) and examined the effect of dnSTAT3 and Oct-3/4 siRNA on their promoter activities. dnSTAT3 showed no effect on any of the deleted mutants. Oct-3/4 siRNA reduced the activity of –2220/–13 as compared with the control siRNA but showed no effect on –1400/–13 and –400/–13. These results suggest that the binding sites for STAT3 and Oct-3/4 are located in –2600/–2220 and –2220/–1400, respectively. Based on several target sequences of STAT3 that have been reported (17Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Yuan J. Lottspeich F. Muller-Esterl W. Schindler C. Roeb E. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol.

Biochem. 2006; 288: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the consensus binding sequence of STAT3 seems to be 5′-TTC(C/T)N(A/G)GAA-3′, where N represents any nucleotide. When we looked for this sequence in –2600/–2220, one similar sequence (5′-TTCTGATAA-3′) was found at –2235/–2227. Disruption of this sequence by mutagenesis reduced promoter activity, suggesting that STAT3 binds with this sequence (Fig. 2C). Similarly, we found two candidate sequences for the Oct-3/4-binding site in –2220/–1400, and mutation analysis suggested that Oct-3/4 binds to 5′-AGGAGCAT-3′ at –2019/–2012 but not to 5′-GAATGCAT-3′ at –2089/–2082. In good correspondence with the synergistic effect of dnSTAT3 and Oct-3/4 siRNA on the Eed promoter (Fig. 2B), disruption of both STAT3- and Oct-3/4-binding sites further reduced promoter activity. We next conducted a ChIP assay with antibodies against STAT3 and Oct-3/4. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the DNA fragment encompassing from –2250 to –1882 was co-precipitated with both STAT3 and Oct-3/4. On the other hand, the DNA fragment from –382 to –12, which does not contain any STAT3- and Oct-3/4-binding site, was not co-precipitated, suggesting the in vivo association of STAT3 and Oct-3/4 with the promoter region of Eed through their putative binding sites. To demonstrate that STAT3 and Oct-3/4 directly bind to their putative binding sites in the Eed promoter, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assay. When the STAT3 probe, an oligonucleotide containing the putative STAT3 binding site at –2235/–2227, was incubated with the nuclear extracts isolated from STAT3-expressing HEK293 cells, the mobility of the probe was retarded (Fig. 3C, lane 2). In contrast, no retardation was observed in the case of nuclear extracts prepared from HEK293 cells (lane 6), suggesting that exogenous STAT3 in the extracts binds with the STAT3 probe. This binding was competed by an excess amount of unlabeled STAT3 competitor, whereas mutated STAT3 competitor gave no effect on the binding, suggesting the sequence-specific binding of STAT3 with the DNA probe. Treatment of the cells with LIF enhanced the binding of endogenous and exogenous STAT3 to the probe (Fig. 3C, lanes 10 and 12). Furthermore, when nuclear extracts prepared from STAT3ER-expressing HEK293 cells were stimulated with 4HT and subjected to an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, activation of STAT3ER also resulted in mobility shift of the STAT3 probe (Fig. 3C, lane 14). Similarly, when the recombinant Oct-3/4 protein was incubated with the labeled Oct-3/4 probe, the probe showed retarded mobility (Fig. 3D, lane 2), and this retardation was inhibited by unlabeled competitor but not by mutated competitor (lanes 3 and 4). These data indicate the direct binding of STAT3 and Oct-3/4 with the putative binding sequences in the Eed promoter. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that Eed is a direct target of STAT3 and Oct-3/4 and raised the possibility that Eed plays an important role in suppression of differentiation-associated molecules downstream of these two transcription factors. Reversible Silencing of Differentiation-associated Genes by Eed—If Eed is involved in the STAT3- and Oct-3/4-mediated regulation of gene expression in ES cells, abrogation of Eed expression should lead to the induction of several differentiation-associated genes whose expression is suppressed by STAT3 and/or Oct-3/4 in self-renewing ES cells. Indeed, several groups have already reported that repression of Eed results in the induction of differentiation-specific markers (20Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2072138264,"D6 is a heptahelical receptor that suppresses inflammation and tumorigenesis by scavenging extracellular pro-inflammatory CC chemokines. Previous studies suggested this is dependent on constitutive trafficking of stable D6 protein to and from the cell surface via recycling endosomes. By internalizing chemokine each time it transits the cell surface, D6 can, over time, remove large quantities of these inflammatory mediators. We have investigated the role of the conserved 58-amino acid C terminus of human D6, which, unlike the rest of the protein, shows no clear homology to other heptahelical receptors. We show that, in human HEK293 cells, a serine cluster in this region controls the constitutive phosphorylation, high stability, and intracellular trafficking itinerary of the receptor and drives green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestins to membranes at, and near, the cell surface. Unexpectedly, however, these properties, and the last 44 amino acids of the C terminus, are dispensable for D6 internalization and effective scavenging of the chemokine CCL3. Even in the absence of the last 58 amino acids, D6 still initially internalizes CCL3 but, surprisingly, exposure to ligand inhibits subsequent CCL3 uptake by this mutant. Progressive scavenging is therefore abrogated. We conclude that the heptahelical body of D6 on its own can engage the endocytotic machinery of HEK293 cells but that the C terminus is indispensable for scavenging because it prevents initial chemokine engagement of D6 from inhibiting subsequent chemokine uptake."

https://openalex.org/W2031130917,"Wdr5 is developmentally expressed in osteoblasts and accelerates osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. To address whether Wdr5 is essential for osteoblast differentiation, plasmid-based small interfering RNAs were used to stably suppress endogenous Wdr5 protein levels in MC3T3-E1 cells. Reduction of endogenous Wdr5 levels markedly inhibited osteoblast differentiation, evidenced by a significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity, Runx-2 and osteocalcin mRNAs, and absence of mineralized matrix formation. Wdr5 suppression also resulted in a reduction of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, confirming its critical role in this modification. Because Wdr5 overexpression enhances canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblasts in vivo, the effects of Wdr5 silencing on this pathway were examined. The expression of the canonical Wnt target gene, c-myc, was decreased, whereas that of sfrp2, which is repressed by Wnt signaling, was increased with Wdr5 knockdown. Although only a minimal increase in apoptosis was observed, the antiapoptotic effect of Wnt signaling was also impaired with Wdr5 silencing. The expression of canonical Wnts was significantly decreased with Wdr5 knockdown, resulting in a decrease in nuclear β-catenin protein levels. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway did not overcome the effects of Wdr5 knockdown on the expression of Wnt target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Wdr5 is present on the Wnt1 promoter and on canonical Wnt response elements of the c-myc and Runx-2 promoters. These studies demonstrate that Wdr5 suppression interferes with the canonical Wnt signaling pathway at multiple stages and that optimal Wdr5 levels are required for induction of the osteoblast phenotype.

These proteins bind to Frizzled G protein-coupled receptors and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) cell surface co-receptors. Signaling by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, also referred to as the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, impairs degradation of cytoplasmic β-catenin, resulting in its nuclear translocation and regulation of target gene expression.

Plasmid-based RNA-mediated interference was used to decrease endogenous Wdr5 protein levels in MC3T3-E1 cells.

To evaluate the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, confluent cells were treated for 5 h with control CM or Wnt-3a CM prior to RNA extraction. To evaluate the effect of BMP-2, confluent cells were treated for 2, 4, or 24 h with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) prior to RNA extraction. siRNA Design—Using the “design tool” provided by Ambion (Ambion, Austin, TX), four siRNAs (siRNAs 1, 2, 3, and 4) targeting the mouse Wdr5 cDNA sequences were designed as was one scrambled sequence (siRNA-S). BLAST (NCBI) analyses were performed to exclude homology with other genes in the eukaryotic genome. The selected siRNAs were then subcloned into the pSilencer 3.1-H1 neo siRNA expression vector (Ambion), downstream from the H1 RNA polymerase III promoter. DNA sequence analysis was performed to confirm insertion of the selected siRNAs. Transfections—MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 103 cells/cm2. After 24 h, they were stably transfected with each of the vectors using calcium phosphate precipitation. The following day and every 48 h thereafter for 14 days, medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 300 μg/ml G418. This dose of G418 has been shown to kill 100% of untransfected cells in 10 days. G418-resistant colonies were then isolated to evaluate Wdr5 protein levels. Western Analysis—Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for 4 and 7 days. Cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton. Ten μgof protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Immunodetection was performed with anti-Wdr5 (23Gori F. Divieti P. Demay M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46515-46522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), anti-histone H3 (tri methyl K4) (AbCam, Cambridge, MA), anti-caspase-9, and anti-Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling Technologies). To evaluate β-catenin protein levels, cytosolic and nuclear extracts were isolated using the PARIS Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunodetection was performed with anti-β-catenin (BD Biosciences). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 4 to 29 days. At each time point, the alkaline phosphatase activity in cell lysates was assessed in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1.5 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol for 1 h at 37 °C using p-nitrophenylphosphate as a substrate. The release of p-nitrophenol was monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Real-time PCR—Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 4 to 29 days. Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Sigma). Twenty μg of total RNA was DNase-digested (MessageClean kit, Gen-hunter Corp., Brookline, MA) following which cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the Opticon DNA engine system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The efficacy of DNase digestion was confirmed by performing analyses in the presence and absence of reverse transcriptase. mRNA levels encoding each gene of interest were normalized for actin mRNA in the same sample using the formula of Livak and Schmittgen (24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Amst.). 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar). Measurement of Mineralized Matrix Formation and Calcium Accumulation—Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging from 14 to 29 days. Calcium deposited into the matrix was quantitated by solubilization with 0.6 n HCl overnight at room temperature. The samples and a standard curve of calcium carbonate were reacted with methylthymol blue and measured spectrophotometrically at 620 nm. Quantitation of Apoptotic Cell Death—Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for periods ranging 4–10 days. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry using double staining with annexin V-phycoerythrin and Nexin 7-amino-actinomycin D (Nexin 7-AAD), with a GUAVA Technologies personal cytometer using the GUAVA Nexin kit (GUAVA Technologies Inc. Hayward, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for 7 days. Cells were then transfected with 1 μg of BRE-Luc (25Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4883-4891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and 0.01 μgof Renilla luciferase using Effectene (Roche Diagnostic) and treated or not treated with 50 ng/ml BMP-2. Luciferase activity was determined 24 h later using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Light intensity was measured with a luminometer, and firefly luciferase activity was corrected for Renilla luciferase activity to normalize for transfection efficiency. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analyses—MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 and cultured for 7 days. Formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin samples were isolated using a ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatin samples were incubated with 10 μgof α-Wdr5. Real-time PCR was performed using primers amplifying the Wnt1 promoter (–59/+162) and primers encompassing the TCF elements within the c-myc promoter (26Sierra J. Yoshida T. Joazeiro C.A. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and the Runx2 P1 promoter (27Gaur T. Lengner C.J. Hovhannisyan H. Bhat R.A. Bodine P.V. Komm B.S. Javed A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). Primers amplifying sequences in exon 4 of Runx2 or 10 kb upstream the c-myc promoter were used to normalize for DNA content and to calculate the relative ratio of the promoter sequences over control sequences using the formula of Livak and Schmittgen (24Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Amst.). 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar), in a method identical to that used to normalize levels of RNA of interest to those of housekeeping genes (actin or GAPDH). Fold enrichment reflects the ratio of promoter/control sequences in the immunoprecipitate versus the input samples. Normal rabbit IgG was used as a control. Statistical Analyses—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's paired t test was used to identify significant differences between the scrambled and specific siRNA-transfected cells at each time point. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overexpression of Wdr5 dramatically accelerates the program of osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Studies were, therefore, undertaken to determine whether Wdr5 is essential for osteoblastic differentiation. The murine osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 was chosen for these studies since these cells have features of preosteoblasts and recapitulate the program of osteoblast differentiation when cultured for up to 4 weeks (28Xiao G. Gopalakrishnan R. Jiang D. Reith E. Benson M.D. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In addition, MC3T3-E1 cells have been used by other investigators to study the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (29Almeida M. Han L. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41342-41351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 30Rawadi G. Vayssiere B. Dunn F. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Bone Miner.

MC3T3-E1 cells were stably transfected with vectors containing siRNAs 1, 2, 3, and 4, which specifically target the Wdr5 coding region, or with a scrambled siRNA (siRNA-S) (Fig. 1A). Endogenous Wdr5 protein levels were assessed by Western analyses after 4 and 7 days in culture. At 4 days, clones expressing siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 demonstrated a significant decrease in endogenous Wdr5 protein levels relative to that of the siRNA-S clones (Fig. 1, B and C). This decrease persisted at 7 days in culture, when Wdr5 protein levels are maximally expressed (23Gori F. Divieti P. Demay M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46515-46522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). Wdr5 protein levels were not affected by either siRNA-1 or siRNA-3 (data not shown); therefore, studies were performed with clones expressing siRNA-2, siRNA-4, and siRNA-S. Because Wdr5 is essential for H3K4 trimethylation (1Dou Y. Milne T.A. Tackett A.J. Smith E.R. Fukuda A. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Chait B.T. Hess J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 2Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D. Cell. 2005; 121: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), a marker of actively transcribed genes, the effect of Wdr5 knockdown on H3K4 trimethylation was investigated. Suppression of Wdr5 expression resulted in a significant decrease in H3K4 trimethylation (Fig. 1D). Acquisition of the osteoblast phenotype is characterized by the ability of cells to synthesize alkaline phosphatase; an increase in the specific activity of this enzyme is directly correlated with a more differentiated state. Therefore, the time course of onset and magnitude of alkaline phosphatase activity was evaluated. In contrast to cells expressing siRNA-S, siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells failed to show a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity from 4 to 29 days in culture (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the expression of other markers of osteoblast differentiation was altered when Wdr5 expression was suppressed, the level of the mRNAs encoding Runx2, a transcription factor involved in osteoblast commitment and differentiation, and of osteocalcin, a marker of late osteoblast differentiation, was examined by quantitative real-time PCR. At 4 days in culture, Runx2 mRNA expression was significantly decreased by 5.2 ± 0.18 S.E. and 3-fold ±0.57 S.E. in siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells, respectively, relative to that of cells expressing siRNA-S. This decrease in Runx2 mRNA persisted until 29 days in both the siRNA-2 and the siRNA-4 cells (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2B, cells expressing siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 failed to demonstrate the differentiation-dependent increase in osteocalcin mRNA expression observed in the siRNA-S cells. The final stage of osteoblast differentiation is the formation of mineralized matrix. Cells expressing siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 failed to deposit mineralized matrix (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that Wdr5 knockdown dramatically impairs osteoblast differentiation. This impairment in differentiation was not associated with an alteration in cell doubling time (data not shown). Based on our previous studies demonstrating that overexpression of Wdr5 enhances canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblasts in vivo, investigations were performed to determine whether Wdr5 is essential for Wnt signaling in MC3T3-E1 cells. The expression of Runx-2 and c-myc, which are induced in response to activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (26Sierra J. Yoshida T. Joazeiro C.A. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 27Gaur T. Lengner C.J. Hovhannisyan H. Bhat R.A. Bodine P.V. Komm B.S. Javed A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar), was significantly decreased at both 4 and 7 days in culture (Figs. 2B and 3), whereas mRNA levels of secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 (Sfrp2), the expression of which is repressed by canonical Wnt signaling, was significantly increased in the siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells relative to the siRNA-S cells (Fig. 3). Thus, these findings demonstrate that when Wdr5 levels are suppressed, canonical Wnt signaling is impaired. Because canonical Wnt signaling has been shown to inhibit osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, investigations were performed to address whether enhanced apoptosis was observed with Wdr5 knockdown. After 4 days in culture, no significant differences were observed in activated (cleaved) caspase-9, a key effector of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells relative to siRNA-S cells (Fig. 4, A and B). A significant increase in total and cleaved caspase-9 was observed at 7 days in culture in both siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells relative to that of cells expressing siRNA-S. The increase in caspase-9 was accompanied by decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 at both 4 and 7 days in culture in siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells when compared with siRNA-S cells (Fig. 4, A and B). To determine whether increased apoptosis could be responsible for the impaired osteoblast differentiation observed when Wdr5 protein levels are suppressed, apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry using double staining with annexin V-phycoerythrin to detect phosphatidylserine on the external membrane of early apoptotic cells and the cell-impermeant dye, Nexin 7-AAD, as an indicator of membrane structural integrity. Quantitation of early and late apoptotic cells at 4 and 10 days in culture revealed that suppression of Wdr5 resulted in a significant increase in apoptotic cells in the siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells relative to that of cells expressing siRNA-S. (Fig. 4C) However, the absolute increase in apoptosis remained less than 4% in the siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the observed impairment in osteoblast differentiation is not a reflection of a profound increase in cell apoptosis. Investigations were then performed to address whether changes in the expression of canonical Wnts could account for impaired canonical Wnt signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 5A, the expression of Wnt1 and Wnt3a was markedly decreased in the siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells at both 4 and 7 days in culture when compared with siRNA-S cells. To address the functional consequences of the decreased expression of canonical Wnts, nuclear β-catenin levels were examined. A decrease in nuclear β-catenin levels was observed in the siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells relative to the siRNA-S cells (Fig. 5, B and C), whereas expression of cytosolic β-catenin was not affected at either time point (data not shown). Since BMP-2 has been shown to activate canonical Wnt signaling, we addressed whether our observations could reflect impaired responsiveness to endogenous BMPs produced by MC3T3-E1 cells. Thus, the expression of Runx2 and Wnt1 was examined after treatment of cells with 100 ng/ml BMP-2. As shown in Fig. 6A, Runx-2 and Wnt1 mRNA expression was significantly induced by 2 h of BMP-2 treatment in siRNA-S cells and was markedly impaired by Wdr5 knockdown (Fig. 6A). These findings demonstrate that BMP signaling is impaired when Wdr5 levels are suppressed. However, induction of a transiently expressed BRE-Luc fusion gene was not impaired in the siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells (Fig. 6B), suggesting that optimal Wdr5 levels are required for induction of gene expression only when chromatin modifications are involved. To address whether activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway could overcome the effects of Wdr5 knockdown, induction of gene expression in response to Wnt3a was examined. As shown in Fig. 6C, whereas treatment with Wnt3a conditioned medium resulted in a significant increase in Runx-2 and c-myc mRNA expression in siRNA-S cells, this increase was significantly attenuated in siRNA-2 and siRNA-4 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses were then performed to assess whether Wdr5 interacts with the promoters of these genes. As shown in Fig. 7, Wdr5 was specifically recruited to the Wnt1 promoter and to canonical Wnt response elements of c-myc (–1447/–1144) and Runx-2 (–123/+123), the latter of which overlaps its promoter (27Gaur T. Lengner C.J. Hovhannisyan H. Bhat R.A. Bodine P.V. Komm B.S. Javed A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that when endogenous Wdr5 levels are suppressed, BMP and canonical Wnt signaling is impaired, establishing that Wdr5 is critical for the effects of these pathways on induction of the osteoblast phenotype. A number of transcription factors, cytokines, growth factors, and hormones have been shown to play an important role in osteoblast differentiation. However, investigations in cells or animal models in which expression of these factors is suppressed or ablated do not uniformly identify an essential role for these factors in osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, our investigations into the role of Wdr5 in osteoblast differentiation demonstrate that this WD repeat protein, which activates gene transcription via chromatin remodeling, is not only capable of accelerating osteoblast differentiation when it is overexpressed (3Gori F. Friedman L.G. Demay M.B. Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Gori F. Divieti P. Demay M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46515-46522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but is actually essential for osteoblast differentiation. Although cells with siRNA-mediated Wdr5 knockdown exhibited low levels of Runx2 early in culture, they were incapable of acquiring markers of early or late osteoblasts, including expression of alkaline phosphatase activity, expression of osteocalcin mRNA, or mineralized matrix formation. The finding that trimethylation of H3K4 was impaired when Wdr5 is suppressed is consistent with previous findings that Wdr5 plays a crucial role in histone modification (1Dou Y. Milne T.A. Tackett A.J. Smith E.R. Fukuda A. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Chait B.T. Hess J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 2Wysocka J.

Overexpression of Wdr5 in osteoblasts accelerates endochondral bone formation by interacting with and enhancing the activity of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (3Gori F. Friedman L.G. Demay M.B.

Consistent with our previous findings demonstrating enhanced canonical Wnt signaling when Wdr5 was overexpressed in vivo, suppression of Wdr5 protein levels results in decreased expression of Wnt1 and Wnt3a. As a result, nuclear β-catenin is decreased, and impaired regulation of target genes of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway occurs when Wdr5 levels are suppressed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also show that Wdr5 is found in association with the β-catenin/TCF response elements of the Runx2 promoter (27Gaur T. Lengner C.J. Hovhannisyan H. Bhat R.A. Bodine P.V. Komm B.S. Javed A. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar), with the Lef/TCF binding elements of c-myc promoter as well as with the Wnt1 promoter. Thus, Wdr5 is required for optimal expression of canonical Wnts and for their down-stream actions. Similar to studies demonstrating that β-catenin recruits the MLL2 complex (which contains Wdr5) to the c-myc gene (26Sierra J. Yoshida T. Joazeiro C.A. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), Wdr5 may be required to promote chromatin modifications at the promoters of genes involved in osteoblast differentiation. Although suppression of Wdr5 protein levels leads to impaired expression of mRNAs encoding markers of osteoblast differentiation and of c-myc, which is up-regulated in response to canonical Wnt signaling, this does not reflect a global suppression of gene expression. The expression of the housekeeping gene, actin, was not altered by Wdr5 silencing, and the expression of Sfrp2, which is suppressed by canonical Wnt signaling, was enhanced in response to Wdr5 silencing. Furthermore, BMP-2 induction of a transiently expressed fusion gene was not impaired in cells with Wdr5 knockdown. BMP-2 has been shown to enhance Wnt1 and Wnt3a expression and to activate β-catenin signaling (30Rawadi G. Vayssiere B. Dunn F. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1842-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 32Bain G. Muller T. Wang X. Papkoff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Our findings that Wdr5 is required for effects of BMP signaling on canonical Wnt signaling suggest that Wdr5 may be required for the expression of genes that promote osteoblast differentiation in response to these two signaling pathways. The observation that activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway does not overcome the effects of Wdr5 suppression on Wnt target genes confirms that the impairment in osteoblast differentiation observed in cells stably expressing siRNAs targeting Wdr5 is due, at least in part, to a decrease in canonical Wnt signaling. These data are consistent with in vivo findings that loss or gain of function of several key effectors of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is associated with either a decrease or an increase in osteoblast differentiation and function. However, our investigations cannot exclude the possibility that Wdr5 also interacts with other signaling pathways that play a role in osteoblast differentiation. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway prevents osteoblast apoptosis (4Krishnan V. Bryant H.U. Macdougald O.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 29Almeida M. Han L. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. J. Biol.

Investig. 2005; 28: 3-7PubMed Google Scholar). Wnt1 inhibits apoptosis by blocking caspase-9 activation, and Wnt3a induces expression of Bcl-2 in MC3T3-E1 cells, thereby prolonging their survival (29Almeida M. Han L. Bellido T. Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41342-41351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 36Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased cleavage of caspase-9 and decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, observed in cells stably expressing Wdr5 siRNAs are most likely a consequence of impaired canonical Wnt signaling. However, our results cannot rule out the possibility that Wdr5 plays a role in cell survival by activating or inactivating additional signaling pathways involved in cell survival. Notable in this respect is the observation that, despite the marked effects of Wdr5 silencing on expression of Bcl2 and activation of caspase-9, there is only a minimal increase in apoptosis in these cells. Thus, these data suggest that other factors are called into play in the cells with Wdr5 knockdown that modulate the downstream consequences of enhanced activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, this modest increase in cell death observed cannot account for the dramatic effect of Wdr5 silencing on the program of osteoblast differentiation. Additional investigations will be required to determine the mechanisms by which the effects of Wdr5 on chromatin lead to enhanced osteoblast survival and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1970619948,"The evolutionarily conserved Wnt/Wingless signal transduction pathway directs cell proliferation, cell fate, and cell death during development in metazoans and is inappropriately activated in several types of cancer. The majority of colorectal carcinomas contain truncating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor, a negative regulator of Wnt/Wingless signaling. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila Apc homologs also have an activating role in both physiological and ectopic Wingless signaling. The Apc amino terminus is important for its activating function, whereas the β-catenin binding sites are dispensable. Apc likely promotes Wingless transduction through down-regulation of Axin, a negative regulator of Wingless signaling. Given the evolutionary conservation of APC in Wnt signal transduction, an activating role may also be present in vertebrates with relevance to development and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021096348,"Dystrophic cardiac calcification (DCC) is an autosomal recessive trait characterized by calcium phosphate deposits in myocardial tissue. The Abcc6 gene locus was recently found to mediate DCC; however, at the molecular level the causative variants remain to be determined. Examining the sequences of Abcc6 cDNA in DCC-resistant C57BL/6 and DCC-susceptible C3H/He mice, we identified a missense mutation (Cys to Thr at codon 619, rs32756904) at the 3′-border of exon 14 that creates an additional donor splice site (GT). Accordingly, an alternative transcript variant was detected, lacking the last 5 bp of exon 14 (-AGG(C/T)GCTgtga-) in DCC-susceptible C3H/He mice that carry the Thr allele. The 5-bp deletion was found to result in premature termination at codon 684, in turn leading to protein deficiency in DCC-susceptible mouse tissue as well as in cells transfected with Abcc6 cDNA lacking the last 5 bp of exon 14. All mouse strains that were found to carry the Thr allele, including C3H/He, DBA/2J, and 129S1/SvJ, were also found to be positive for DCC. In summary, we identified a splice variant leading to a 5-bp deletion in the Abcc6 transcript that gives rise to protein deficiency both in vivo and in vitro. The fact that all mouse strains that carry the deletion also develop dystrophic calcifications further suggests that the underlying splice variant affects the biological function of MRP6 protein and is a cause of DCC in mice. Dystrophic cardiac calcification (DCC) is an autosomal recessive trait characterized by calcium phosphate deposits in myocardial tissue. The Abcc6 gene locus was recently found to mediate DCC; however, at the molecular level the causative variants remain to be determined. Examining the sequences of Abcc6 cDNA in DCC-resistant C57BL/6 and DCC-susceptible C3H/He mice, we identified a missense mutation (Cys to Thr at codon 619, rs32756904) at the 3′-border of exon 14 that creates an additional donor splice site (GT).

In western countries such calcification can affect the arterial system in patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. Interestingly, similar deposits are also observed in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a heritable disorder of the connective tissue that prominently affects the arteries of skin, eye, and heart.Both DCC and PXE were reported to develop spontaneously in aging mice and human, respectively. DCC, however, may also be induced in mice by various stimuli such as infectious agents (1Gang D.L. Barett L.V. Wilson E.J. Rubin R.H. Medearis D.N. Am. J.

The genetic basis of DCC was initially facilitated by the identification of a major QTL locus named Dyscalc1 on mouse chromosome 7 that contributes to DCC (12Ivandic B.T. Qiao J.H. Machleder D.

We ultrafine-mapped this locus to an 80-kb region on proximal mouse chromosome 7 that contains only two known genes, epithelial membrane protein-3 (EMP-3) and the ATP binding cassette C 6(Abcc6), and one gene of unknown function (BC013491) using an in silico mapping strategy (13Aherrahrou Z.

In parallel, the locus for PXE was identified on human chromosome 16p13.1 to a 500-kb region that also includes Abcc6 (14Van Soest S. Swart J. Tijmes N. Sandkuijl L.A. Rommers J. Bergen A.A.

ABC proteins bind and hydrolyze ATP to meet the energy requirement for transportation of various molecules across the plasma membrane. Similar processes may take place at intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisome, and mitochondria (19Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome. Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). ABC proteins are involved in the transport or removal of toxic metabolites using substrates such as glutathione (20Ilias A.

The Abcc6 gene encodes a 165-kDa protein named MRP6. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney. Interestingly, these tissues are not predominantly affected by either DCC or PXE (21Beck K. Hayashi K. Nishiguchi B. Le Saux O. Hayashi M. Boyd C.D. J. Histochem.

Amplicons were analyzed after electrophoresis on a 1% QA-Agarose™ gel (Qbiogene) and Sybr Green® I staining. For the amplification of the PCR product flanking the 5-bp deletion, we used primer pairs that produce a 156-bp PCR fragment (Table 1, del-5bp-ex14). For the separation of the 5-bp deletion fragment, high resolution electrophoresis was performed overnight using a 4% MetaPhor® gel (Biozym Scientific GmbH, Oldendorf, Germany) and ethidium bromide staining.Genotyping of Laboratory Mice—Using primer pairs Abcc6.g.ex14 (forward, tggcccactcttgtatctcc/reverse, ttgggtaccaagtgacacga), we amplified PCR fragments containing the Cys to Thr mutation at codon 619 in 11 laboratory mouse strains: C57BL/6J (C57), C57BL/10J (B10), C3H/HeJ (C3H), DBA/2J (DBA), 129S1/SvJ (129S1), Balb/cJ (Balb/c), CBA/J (CBA), AKR/J (AKR), FVB/NJ (FVB), MRL/MpJ (MRL), and NZB/BINJ (NZB).Generation of Abcc6 cDNA Lacking the Last 5 bp at Exon 14—A synthetic clone containing the Abcc6 cDNA sequence (pSG5-Abcc6cDNA) encoding the full-length mouse MRP6 protein (Q9R1S7) was purchased from RZPD (Deutches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomeforschung GmbH). Using primer pairs cgagtaactccagcctcgaaggatc and gatccttcgaggctggagttactcg, the 5-bp deletion was introduced into the template pSG5-Abcc6cDNA (pSG5-Abcc6) by site-directed mutagenesis reaction to generate the pSG5-Abcc6-5bpdel-cDNA (pSG5-Abcc6-5bpdel) constructs using the QuikChange® XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit according to the instruction of the manufacturer (Stratagene). To confirm the correct sequence, both pSG5-Abcc6cDNA and pSG5-Abcc6-5bpdel-cDNA constructs were sequenced (Seqlab).In Vitro Transcription and Translation—pSG5-Abcc6cDNA, pSG5-Abcc6-5bpdel-cDNA, and pSG5 empty vector constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System; Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. [35S]Methionine was obtained from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany). After incubation, 1 μl of the reaction batch was dissolved in Laemmli buffer and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%). To detect the [35S]-labeled proteins, the dried gels were autoradiographed (16 h). The gels were analyzed using the software PCBAS 2.09g (Raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH).Cell Culture and Cell Transfection—Human embryonal kidney cells (HEK-293) were kindly provided by Dr. Stefanie Stoelting (University of Luebeck), and the cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1×) with glucose 4.5 g/liter and l-glutamine-pyruvate, containing 15% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (1×) at 37°C and 5% CO2. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 into Lab-Tek® 4-well glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc Int.). The cells were transfected with DNA from pSG5, pSG5-Abcc6, and pSG5-Abcc6-5bpdel plasmids using nanofectin transfection reagent and following the instruction of the manufacturer (PAA Laboratorie GmbH). Two days after transfection, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and analyzed immunohistologically. Similarly, cells were plated into 24-well plates and transfected with the three constructs for Western blot analysis.Immunohistological Analysis—Immunostaining was performed with a polyclonal anti-mouse MRP6-S20 antibody at 5 μg/ml (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as previously described (11Aherrahrou Z. Axtner S.B. Kaczmarek P.M. Jurat A. Korff S. Doehring L.C. Weichenhan D. Katus H.A. Ivandic B.T. Am. J.

Briefly, bound MRP6 primary antibodies were detected using biotinylated secondary antibodies that were visualized using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex and diaminobenzidine as supplied with the Cell and Tissue Staining kit (R&D systems). Slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Controls were performed without primary antibodies.Western Blot Analysis—Protein extract was prepared from the liver of mice following standard protocols. Liver tissue samples frozen in liquid nitrogen were homogenized using a mortar. Lysis buffer (1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling), 1× Roche cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), and 1 mm Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) containing urea (8 m) was added, and samples were centrifuged. After protein quantification, 30 μg were sampled and separated on a 6.5% SDS-PAGE and afterward electrotransferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% lowfat milk, membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies MRP6-S20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and α-actin from (Abcam plc). The epitope of the polyclonal MRP6 has a length of ∼15-25 aa and maps within aa 1-50 at the N terminus of MRP6 of mouse origin (Swiss Prot protein accession number Q9R1S7). For signal detection, the ECL-plus Western blotting detection system (RPN, 2132; GE Healthcare) was used. Chemiluminescence detection was performed with a Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad).Statistical Analysis—Data analyses were performed by Student's t test, and results are expressed as the means ± S.E., with p <0.05 as significant.RESULTSMRP6 Protein Expression in Mice—Previous reports have shown that the Abcc6 gene product MRP6 is highly expressed in the liver. To find evidence of an association or correlation between the level of MRP6 protein expression and the observed DCC phenotype in mice, we analyzed MRP6 expression in the liver of DCC-susceptible C3H and DCC-resistant C57 mice as well as congenic mice (Cg1). Western blot analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in MRP6 expression in the liver of both DCC-susceptible C3H and Cg1 mice compared with liver tissue from DCC-resistant C57 mice (Fig. 1, A and B). With the MRP6 protein expression level in the liver of C57 mice defined as 100%, the expression levels were determined to be 34 ± 12 and 33 ± 17% in C3H and Cg1 mice, respectively.Sequencing of Abcc6 cDNA—To search for novel genetic regulatory elements that might affect the Abcc6 gene expression and thus of the corresponding encoded protein MRP6, we sequenced the 5′-UTR, the coding region, and the 3′-UTR in the cDNA of Abcc6 from DCC-resistant C57 and DCC-susceptible C3H mice. Comparing the genomic sequences between the two inbred strains of mice, we identified a total of 26 SNPs (Table 2). Of these, 25 were known and one SNP was not published previously. Among these SNPs nine resulted in amino acid substitutions (p.A28V, p.V95M, p.S138A, p.I151V, p.R619S, p.V706A, p.K767R, p.T927I, p.A1368T). In addition, we identified two novel small deletions within this region. The 3′-UTR of DCC-susceptible C3H mice was found to contain a 10-bp deletion (GAGCA(TCACACCGAC/del)TCTGA), which is located in a region important for mRNA stability. C3H mice were also found to be heterozygous for another novel 5-bp deletion that was identified at the 3′-border of exon 14.TABLE 2Genomic sequence analysis of Abcc6 and its respective SNP genotypes repartition on DCC-resistant C57 and DCC-susceptible C3H mouse strains SNPs and deletion (del) are represented in parentheses.PositionSNPsFlanking sequenceAmino acid substitutionPosition in cDNAMbpENSMUST0000000285045897184NT_039424.6_6916921GTGATAGGCC (G/A) CAGGCTCCTGp.A28Vc.8345897156NT_039424.6_6916893CGGCTCTCAC (A/G) AAGCACAGGC45888663NT_039424.6_6908400CACAGAGGCA (C/T) GGCCACGTTGp.V95Mc.28345888260NT_039424.6_6907997GGGAGTCCGG (T/G) CATCCGGGGTp.S138Ac.41245888221NT_039424.6_6907958CCTGGCAAGA (T/G) GCAGCAGAGCp.I151Vc.45145882252rs32758366CTGTCCACGC (C/T) GAGGAGTTGC45880689NT_039424.6_6900426CACTGGACAG (G/A) ACCAGGACCT45880623rs32756118CCAGCCGCTG (G/T) ATGTCCACCG45880584rs32756117AGAGCAGCCA (C/A) AGCCCGTTGA45873318rs31429747ACACGACCAG (C/A) GCCACCAGAA45870623rs32756904TAACTCCAGG (C/T) GCTCCTCGAAp.R619S45866857rs32753990GAGGCACGTA (A/C) GCCACGGAAC45866816rs32753988CACATTCTCC (A/C) CCACAGAGGTp.V706Ac.211745866788rs32753987AGGCACAGGC (A/C) TCTAGAACTT45865814NT_039424.6_6884551TTTTGTACAC (A/G) GCCCGAGCCA45867806rs32757904GGCAGCCTTT (T/G) TGTACACAGCp.K767Rc.230045857780rs32757080GTATATGGTG (G/A) TCTTCACCCGp.T927Ic.278045854592NewTGGGAGAGCG (A/T) GCCACGTCCC45854451NT_039424.6_6874188CTGCCAGGCC (G/A) ACCTCCAGGA45847761rs32752395TCCAGCGCTG (C/T) CCAGATGCCTp.A1368Tc.410245845359rs32753722CAGCGCTCCA (G/A) GGCCGCCTGC45845291rs32753714CTTACCTGGC (A/G) CAGTCCATCA45844875rs32757080TAAGAATCCT (T/C) ATTCAAGCGA45844865rs32752435CGGGGGTTGG (T/A) AAGAATCCTT45844518NewCTCTAGAGCA (TCACACCGAC/del) TCTGA45844358NT_039424.6_6864095TATGTGAAAT (C/T) CTGTCTCAAA45844325rs32751538CAGCAACAAA (G/C) AGAGTTCAGG Open table in a new tab Alternative Splice Variant in DCC-susceptible C3H Mice—To confirm the above mentioned heterozygosity for the 5-bp deletion in exon 14, we designed new primer pairs flanking this region (Table 1, del-5bp-ex14 F/R), producing an ∼150-bp PCR product, suitable for separating on a high resolution 4% MetaPhor gel. Fig. 2 shows three bands in C3H mice (Fig. 2A, lane C3H, arrows): the 5-bp deletion (Mut), the wild type (Wt), and an extra band (Hd). In contrast, the C57 mice contain only one band (Fig. 2A, lane C57). To further analyze the bands in C3H mice, we subcloned the PCR product using the TOPO TA Cloning® kit and screened insert clones for differences in insert size. We found inserts with two different sizes (Fig. 2A, lanes C-1 and C-2), the wild type (C-1) and the 5-bp deletion (C-2). We then sequenced the two inserts after PCR amplification using the M13 universal primers (C-1 and C-2). We did not find clones with an insert that corresponds in size to the third band. So we hypothesized the third band (Fig. 2A, Hd) to be a heteroduplex of the two fragments, the wild type and the 5-bp deletion variants. To test this hypothesis, we ran a PCR on a mixture of plasmid DNA from the two clones, C-1 and C-2, that carry either the wild type sequence or the sequence with the 5-bp deletion. Fig. 2B shows the extra band (Hd) present in this mixture.FIGURE 2Identification of an alternatively spliced Abcc6 transcript in DCC-susceptible C3H mice. Arrows designate bands of the Abcc6 PCR product flanking the splice site. A, lanes C57 and C3H are PCR products from DCC-resistant C57 and DCC-susceptible C3H mice, respectively; lanes C-1 and C-2 are PCR products from two clones after subcloning of the reverse transcription PCR product from C3H mice.

In C3H mice, this mutation leads to an amino acid substitution at position 619 (p.R619S). Interestingly, in pre-mRNA of C3H mice, this mutation creates an additional splice donor site (GU) at codon 619, thus effectively resulting in deletion of the last 5 bp (GUGCU) of exon 14 (Fig. 3). This deletion creates a premature stop codon at codon 685, in turn giving rise to a truncated protein of only 684 aa in C3H mice instead of 1449 aa in C57 mice (Fig. 4).FIGURE 3A single base pair mutation creates an additional donor splice site in C3H mice.

Fig. 5A shows two bands with two different molecular masses, respectively: The predicted wild type protein band (MRP6) of nearly 165 kDa and an additional band (∼50 kDa) corresponding to the truncated protein (MRP6 trun). Similar protein bands could be also demonstrated by Western blot analysis using an anti-MRP6 polyclonal antibody that recognizes epitope in the N-terminal region after transfection of HEK-293 cells with both pSG5-Abcc6 and pSG5-Abcc6-del5bp (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5In vitro overexpression of the MRP6 truncated protein.

In comparison to negative controls (empty pSG5 vector), induction in cells transfected with pSG5-Abcc6-del5bp and pSG5-Abcc6 was 73 ± 12 (p < 0.001) and 475 ± 85 (p < 0.001), respectively (Table 3). Thus, using relative real-time reverse transcription PCR, the gene expression of Abcc6 was found to reach only 15% in cells transfected with pSG5-Abcc6-del5bp as compared with cells transfected with the wild type pSG5-Abcc6. Accordingly, immunohistological analysis showed also a low expression level of the truncated protein in cells transfected with pSG5-Abcc6-del5bp compared with cells transfected with the wild type pSG5-Abcc6 (Fig. 6).TABLE 3Relative real-time RT-PCR of Abcc6 in HEK cells Displayed are means ± S.E.SamplesCycle number-Fold inductionGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseAbcc6pSG5 (n = 4)16.74 ± 0.1030.90 ± 0.381pSG5-Abcc6 (n = 4)16.63 ± 0.0422.22 ± 0.34475 ± 85pSG5-Abcc6-5bpdel (n = 4)16.43 ± 0.0524.69 ± 0.3073 ± 12 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 6Immunohistological analysis of MRP6.

Because mantle helium is efficiently extracted by magmatic activity, it cannot remain in fertile mantle rocks for long periods of time. Here, I suggest that helium with high 3He/4He ratios, as well as neon rich in the solar component, diffused early in Earth's history from low-melting-point primordial material into residual refractory ""reservoir"" rocks, such as dunites. The difference in 3He/4He ratios of ocean-island and mid-ocean ridge basalts and the preservation of solar neon are ascribed to the reservoir rocks being stretched and tapped to different extents during melting."

We have engineered a novel chimeric vector relying on the controlled assembly of a TAT-tagged multisubunit DNA binding protein (EcoR124I) with expression plasmids containing the EcoR124I recognition site. Molecular interactions of this molecular assembly were studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and atomic force microscopy. Maintenance of nanocomplexes in an appropriate stoichiometric ratio was both necessary and sufficient to produce a significant (>8-fold) increase in the activity of the therapeutic alpha-galactosidase A enzyme after intramuscular administration in the mouse model of Fabry disease. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular targeting system significantly enhancing plasmid-based expression in skeletal muscle. Coinjection with pluronic SP1017 produced further enhancement of gene expression, demonstrating cumulative effects of the increased nuclear delivery by TAT chimeras and transcription activation by the pluronic. Cell penetration peptides (CPP), such as TAT, have been shown to improve delivery of macromolecules, when linked directly. However, in our system TAT-enhanced targeting took place even though it was linked to the plasmid DNA molecule indirectly via two noncovalent bonds. Therefore, this proof-of principle result indicates that TAT (and potentially other CPP) can be used for targeting modular chimeric vectors and therapeutic nanodevices."

We have isolated the S. pombe thiamine transporter Thi9 by genetic complementation of mutants defective in thiamine biosynthesis and transport. Thi9 localizes to the S. pombe cell surface and works as a high-affinity proton/thiamine symporter. The uptake of thiamine was reduced in the presence of pyrithiamine, oxythiamine, amprolium, and the thiazole part of thiamine, indicating that these compounds are substrates of Thi9. In pyrithiamine-resistant mutants, a conserved glutamate residue close to the first of the 12 transmembrane domains is exchanged by a lysine and this causes aberrant localization of the protein. Thiamine uptake is significantly increased in thiamine-deficient medium and this is associated with an increase in thi9+ mRNA and protein levels. Upon addition of thiamine, the thi9+ mRNA becomes undetectable within minutes, whereas the Thi9 protein appears to be stable. The protein is distantly related to transporters for amino acids, γ-aminobutyric acid and polyamines, and not to any of the known thiamine transporters.

Beriberi was the first disorder for which the term “deficiency disease” was used. It is caused by a lack of thiamine, a water-soluble vitamin (vitamin B1), which was identified in feeding experiments with deficient birds more than 80 years ago. Thiamine plays a pivotal role as coenzyme in intermediary carbon metabolism.

Most bacteria, fungi, and plants are able to synthesize thiamine. The two structural moieties of thiamine, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP) and 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole (HET), are assembled by separate pathways. These pathways are well established in bacteria but appear to be completely different in most eukaryotes (2Begley T.P. Downs D.M. Ealick S.E. McLafferty F.W. Van Loon A.P. Taylor S. Campobasso N. Chiu H.J. Kinsland C. Reddick J.J. Xi J. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 3Settembre E. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HMP and HET are phosphorylated and condensed to thiamine monophosphate. In eukaryotes, thiamine monophosphate is first hydrolyzed to free thiamine before it is converted to its cofactor form, whereas in bacteria, thiamine monophosphate is directly phosphorylated to TDP. Some microorganisms, algae, protozoa as well as most higher eukaryotes require thiamine as a growth factor (4Koser S.A. Vitamin Requirements of Bacteria and Yeasts. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1968Google Scholar). In some cases, this requirement can be met by HET or HMP or a combination of both, but in other cases only supplementation of thiamine allows growth (4Koser S.A. Vitamin Requirements of Bacteria and Yeasts. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1968Google Scholar). The mammalian diet is rich in phosphorylated forms of thiamine, which are dephosphorylated before they are taken up (5Bässler K-H. Golly I. Loew D. Pietrzuk K. 3 Ed. Vitamin-Lexikon. Urban & Fischer, München, Jena, Germany2002Google Scholar). In many organisms, the availability of thiamine is known to have profound effects on gene expression. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, thiamine represses more than 60 genes, most of which are involved in thiamine metabolism (6Nosaka K. Onozuka M. Konno H. Kawasaki Y. Nishimura H. Sano M. Akaji K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Mojzita D. Hohmann S. Mol. Genet.

In the current model of thiamine sensing, TDP functions as the intracellular thiamine signal. TDP binds to Thi3, a protein with homology to pyruvate decarboxylases and this weakens the interaction of Thi3 with Thi2, a Cys6 zinc-finger motif containing protein. Together, this is thought to diminish the activity of the Thi2·Thi3 complex to act as a positive regulator of thiamine-controlled genes (9Nosaka K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding protein Pdc2, a transcription factor for the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase, appears to control the same set of genes and may link the production of TDP to the available carbon source (7Mojzita D. Hohmann S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2006; 276: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TDP also mediates gene regulation in bacteria. It binds with high affinity to a regulatory RNA structure encoded in the 5′-untranslated regions of thiamine biosynthetic operons, thus reducing the expression of the downstream structural genes by a riboswitch mechanism (10Miranda-Rios J. Navarro M. Soberon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9736-9741Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Rodionov D.A. Vitreschak A.G. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 419: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In summary, most microorganisms have evolved means to ensure that thiamine is not produced in higher amounts than required for TDP biosynthesis. Thiamine-dependant organisms require efficient plasma membrane transport proteins for thiamine acquisition. In S. cerevisiae, thiamine uptake is a high affinity process (Km = 0.18 μm) that accumulates the substrate and displays an acidic pH optimum (13Iwashima A. Nishino H. Nose Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whereas HMP appears to share the same uptake system with thiamine, HET uses a different permeation pathway (14Iwashima A. Kawasaki Y. Kimura Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These results with intact S. cerevisiae cells likely reflect the activity of Thi7, the first thiamine transporter identified on a molecular basis (15Enjo F. Nosaka K. Ogata M. Iwashima A.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two paralogs of Thi7, Thi71 and Thi72, appear to have only a minor contribution to thiamine translocation (7Mojzita D.

Similar to S. cerevisiae, thiamine regulates the expression of genes involved in its synthesis. Of these, nmt1+ and nmt2+ are extensively studied. The Nmt2 protein is ∼60% identical to S. cerevisiae Thi4, the only eukaryotic enzyme of the HET biosynthetic pathway known to date. Thi4 appears to initiate and catalyze a complex series of reactions that use NAD+ as a carbon donor and result in the formation of adenosine diphospho-5-(β-ethyl)-4-methyl-thiazole-2-carboxylic acid (23Chatterjee A. Jurgenson C.T. Schroeder F.C. Ealick S.E. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 7158-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Chatterjee A. Jurgenson C.T. Schroeder F.C. Ealick S.E. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nmt1 is 62% identical to the S. cerevisiae protein Thi5. Thi5 or its paralogs Thi11, Thi12, or Thi13 are necessary for the synthesis of the pyrimidine part that starts from pyridoxine phosphate (25Wightman R. Meacock P.A. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1447-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition to thiamine biosynthesis, sexual agglutination and zygote formation also are under control of thiamine in S. pombe (26Schweingruber M.E. Edenharter E. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These regulatory effects are likely mediated by intracellular thiamine or thiamine derivatives and S. pombe has earlier been shown to take up thiamine from the environment (27Schweingruber A.M. Dlugonski J. Edenharter E. Schweingruber M.E. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Tommasino M. Maundrell K. Curr. Genet. 1991; 20: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we identify and characterize the S. pombe thiamine transporter Thi9 and demonstrate that this protein is not related to any of the thiamine transporters isolated before. In the course of the experiments we also found that the Bsu1 protein, which we previously characterized as pyridoxine transporter (29Stolz J. Wöhrmann H.J.P. Vogl C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) contributes to thiamine uptake in S. pombe. Media and Culture Conditions—Synthetic dextrose medium for S. cerevisiae contained 2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco). Thiamine-free synthetic dextrose was made of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without vitamins (BIO101) and was supplemented with all vitamins except thiamine in standard concentrations. Bacto-agar (Difco) was used for solidification. Liquid cultures of S. pombe were grown in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM), a chemically defined medium for fission yeast devoid of thiamine (30Mitchison J.M. Methods Cell Physiol. 1970; 4: 131-165Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). S. pombe strains were crossed on ME plates (3% malt extract, 2% agar). Growth assays were performed on synthetic dextrose plates with cell suspensions of A600 = 0.06, 0.006, and 0.0006. These were prepared in 96-well plates and transferred to agar plates using a steel replication device. Growth was recorded after incubation for 3 to 5 days at 30 °C. Nucleobases and amino acids were added as required. Yeast Strains and Knock-out Mutants—S. cerevisiae BY4742 (Matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) (31Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) was used as wild type strain and was transformed by standard methods (32Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). To delete THI71, the open reading frame was amplified by PCR with specific primers and cloned into pLitmus28 (New England Biolabs). The LEU2 gene was first ligated as a XhoI-SalI fragment from YEp13 (33Rose A.B. Broach J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 234-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) into the SalI site of pUC19 (pUC19-LEU2 I) and from there inserted into the PstI and NdeI sites within the THI71 ORF. To delete THI72, a 340-bp long 5′- and 490-bp long 3′-region of THI72 was amplified from genomic DNA. LYS2 was excised from YDp-K (34Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and inserted together with both PCR fragments into pUC19. The knock-out cassettes were released from the plasmids and subsequently transformed into BY4742 or BY4742 thi7Δ::kanMX4 (EUROSCARF) resulting in the thi71Δ::LEU2 thi72Δ::LYS2 double knock-out (CVY2) and thi7Δ::kanMX4 thi71Δ::LEU2 thi72Δ::LYS2 triple knock-out strain (CVY3). To delete THI4, the HIS3MX6 marker gene containing S. pombe his5+ was amplified from pFA6a-HIS3MX6 (35Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) with specific primers containing terminal regions with homology to THI4. These mediated homologous recombination after transforming the PCR product into CVY3. The transformation mixture was plated on synthetic dextrose containing 120 μm thiamine and one transformant (CVY4, thi7Δ::kanMX4 thi71Δ::LEU2 thi72Δ::LYS2 thi4Δ:: his5+) was used for complementation. S. pombe strains used in this study were FY254 wild type (ade6-M210 can1-1 leu1-32 ura4-D18 h–) (36Liang D.T. Hodson J.A. Forsburg S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 559-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FY254 bsu1Δ::ura4+ (29Stolz J. Wöhrmann H.J.P. Vogl C. Eukaryot.

Genet. 1991; 19: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which we will refer to as ptr1. Further derivatives of FY254 were generated by sequential gene disruptions using knock-out cassettes. For nmt2+, the gene was amplified by PCR and ligated with blunt ends into the SrfI site of pPCR-ScriptAmp (Stratagene). kanMX4 was excised from pFA6a-kanMX4 (37Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar) with SmaI and EcoRI and inserted into ScaI and MfeI sites of nmt2+. To generate a knock-out construct for thi9+, the ORF was amplified by PCR and cloned into a pUC19 derivative with a single NotI site. An internal HincII/EcoRI fragment of thi9+ was exchanged by kanMX4, which was excised from pFA6a-kanMX4 with SmaI and EcoRI. The nmt2Δ::kanMX4, nmt2Δ::LEU2, and thi9Δ::kanMX4 deletion cassettes were liberated with NotI before transformation, which was performed as described previously (38Bähler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie 3rd, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The majority of the strains used in this work resulted from sequential transformations of FY254 or FY254 bsu1Δ::ura4+ with the knock-out cassettes and were verified by PCR. The ptr1 nmt2Δ double mutant was generated by crossing ptr1 to FY254 nmt2Δ::kanMX4 followed by tetrad dissection and marker analysis. The genotype of the spore used for complementation was ptr1–5 nmt2Δ::kanMX4 pho1+ ade6-M210 ura4-D18 h+. thi9+ was genomically fused to gfp or a triple HA tag using an integrative tagging strategy (39Siam R. Dolan W.P. Forsburg S.L. Methods. 2004; 33: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In pBS-bsu1+-GFP and pBS-bsu1+-3HA (29Stolz J. Wöhrmann H.J.P. Vogl C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the bsu1+ coding sequence was replaced with a PCR fragment containing the thi9+ coding sequence without stop codon. In the resulting plasmids, thi9+ is followed by the tag sequence, the S. cerevisiae ADH1 terminator, and the LEU2 gene as transformation marker. The vectors were linearized with NsiI, which cuts 969 bp after the start ATG of thi9+, and transformed into S. pombe wild type cells and ptr1 mutants. After homologous recombination, this results in tagged versions of thi9+, which are expressed from their own promoters. As a result of plasmid integration, the cells contain a second copy of thi9+, which lacks a promoter and will not be expressed. In ptr1 cells, tagging of thi9+ will result in a fusion protein that carries the E81K amino acid exchange. Plasmids—Two S. pombe gene libraries were used in this study. The cDNA library used for complementation of CVY4 was generated in the S. cerevisiae multicopy vector pFL61, in which the inserts are sandwiched between the PGK1 promoter and terminator (40Nagy M. Lacroute F. Thomas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8966-8970Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The S. pombe genomic library in plasmid pUR19 was published before (41Barbet N. Muriel W.J. Carr A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). THI7 from S. cerevisiae was overexpressed as GFP fusion protein. To this end, THI7 including 640 bp of the promoter sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted into the multicopy plasmid YEplac195-GFP. YEplac195-GFP is similar to YCplac33-GFP but contains a 2-μ origin of replication (42Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). The cloning resulted in a translational fusion of THI7 and gfp, which was followed by the S. cerevisiae ADH1 terminator. For thi9+ overexpression in S. cerevisiae, we made use of a PCR product from S. pombe genomic DNA that included only the coding sequence and was inserted into NotI sites of pFL61. Expression of bsu1+ in S. cerevisiae was performed using p426-GPD (43Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Uptake Experiments—Uptake experiments in S. cerevisiae strains were performed as described previously (44Stolz J. Vielreicher M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard mixture contained 500 μl of cells (A600 = 0.5) in citric acid/phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, and was stirred at 30 °C. After pre-warming for 2 min, the cells were energized with 1% glucose and the experiment was started 1 min later by addition of the labeled substrate for a final concentration of 2 μm. The substrate was a mixture of [3H]thiamine (ART-0710; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) and unlabeled thiamine with a specific activity of 0.19 Ci/mmol. Transport assays with S. pombe were performed with the bsu1Δ mutant (29Stolz J. Wöhrmann H.J.P. Vogl C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were inoculated into fresh EMM to A600 = 0.3 and grown at 30 °C until A600 = 1. After harvesting and washing with ice-cold water and EMM, the cells were resuspended in EMM to A600 = 10 and kept on ice. 500 μl of cells (diluted to A600 = 2) were used for the assay that was performed as with S. cerevisiae cells. For uptake experiments in the absence of glucose, the cells were re-suspended in glucose-free EMM. Competitors were added to a final concentration of 20 μm together with the labeled substrate. HET was obtained from Fluka, pyrithiamine and all other competitors used in Fig. 4 were from Sigma and HMP was a generous gift from T. P. Begley. The uncouplers carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and carbonyl cyanide p-(tri-fluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone were from Sigma and were added 3 min prior to adding the substrate. RNA Preparation and Northern Blotting—FY254 wild type cells were grown in EMM without thiamine and nmt2Δ mutants in EMM supplemented with 8 nm thiamine for 3 days at 30 °C with daily passages to deplete intracellular thiamine pools. Fresh EMM was inoculated with overnight cultures to A600 = 0.2 and the cells were grown for 2 h before repression was started by adding thiamine to a final concentration of 1.2 μm. At each time point, 25 A600 units of cells were harvested and RNA was prepared using the hot phenol method (45Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA were separated on formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The genes thi9+ and act1+ (actin) were used as probes and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. After hybridization, the Northern blots were quantified with a phosphorimager and the actin signal intensities were used for normalization. Western Blotting—For Western blots, 10 A600 units of cells were broken with glass beads in 100 μl of TE buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. The lysate was centrifuged (20,000 × g, 20 min, at 4 °C) and the membrane pellet solubilized in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer at 42 °C. The samples were separated on two 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. One gel containing 10 μl of sample/lane was stained with Coomassie dye to serve as a loading control, the other containing 1 μl of sample/lane was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7392), followed by a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Quantification of band intensities was performed with weakly exposed films with the MultiAnalyst software. Identification of the S. pombe Thiamine Transporter—The main transporter for thiamine in S. cerevisiae is encoded by THI7 (YLR237W, synonym THI10), which shares high homology to two other ORFs, THI71 (YOR071C) and THI72 (YOR192C). We tested strains with deletions of these genes for their thiamine uptake activity. A thi71Δ thi72Δ double mutant (CVY2) was similar to a wild type strain, indicating that the main transport activity derives from Thi7. To generate the best possible starting situation for genetic complementation assays, we generated a thi7Δ thi71Δ thi72Δ triple mutant (CVY3). This strain was highly deficient in thiamine uptake (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with earlier findings that Thi71 and Thi72 have only a minor contribution to thiamine transport (7Mojzita D. Hohmann S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2006; 276: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Enjo F. Nosaka K. Ogata M. Iwashima A. Nishimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19165-19170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Singleton C.K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To additionally block thiamine biosynthesis, THI4 was deleted in CVY3. Thi4 catalyzes an essential step in the HET biosynthetic pathway. Hence, thi4Δ mutants strongly depend on an external source of thiamine (46Praekelt U.M. Byrne K.L. Meacock P.A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The resulting quadruple mutant (CVY4) required at least 120 μm thiamine and showed no growth on plates with lower thiamine concentrations (Figs. 1B and 3B). When THI7 was reintroduced on a plasmid, this strain could again grow on 0.012 μm thiamine, confirming that THI7 alone is sufficient to support the growth of S. cerevisiae.FIGURE 3The pyridoxine transporter Bsu1 contributes to thiamine uptake in S. pombe. A, standard uptake assays were performed with S. pombe cells of the indicated genotype using 2 μm thiamine as a substrate. Uptake velocities were determined with the standard assay in the 2-min time course experiments. B, growth of S. cerevisiae CVY4 (thi7Δ thi71Δ thi72Δ thi4Δ) after transformation with an empty plasmid (control), a pFL61 plasmid harboring the cDNA of S. pombe thi9+, or a p426-GPD plasmid containing bsu1+. The plates were scanned 3 days after plating.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To isolate the S. pombe thiamine transporter, the S. cerevisiae strain CVY4 was transformed with an S. pombe cDNA expression library (40Nagy M. Lacroute F. Thomas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8966-8970Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and the cells were plated on media containing 0.12 μm thiamine. A total of 24 transformants were obtained and their library plasmids were isolated. When retransformed into CVY4, 16 of them complemented the growth phenotype. None of the plasmids allowed growth on thiamine-free plates, eliminating the possibility that they contained nmt2+, the S. pombe ortholog of THI4. A total of 10 complementing plasmids were sequenced and all of them contained the complete coding sequence of SPAC9.10. The remaining six plasmids produced similar restriction fragments as the sequenced plasmids, indicating that they also contained this ORF. Expression of SPAC9.10 lacking all upstream and downstream sequences complemented the growth defect of CVY4 to the same extent as the endogenous thiamine transporter gene THI7 (Fig. 1B). A second strategy to identify the S. pombe thiamine transporter made use of a ptr1 strain 5The terms “ptr1 mutants” or “ptr1 gene” as used in this study do not refer to the gene encoding an mRNA transport protein, for which the same symbol was designated (73Andoh T. Azad A.K. Shigematsu A. Ohshima Y. Tani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). that was isolated as a mutant being resistant to pyrithiamine, a toxic structural analog of thiamine (27Schweingruber A.M. Dlugonski J. Edenharter E. Schweingruber M.E. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Pyrithiamine resistance is caused by a lack of pyrithiamine uptake and has earlier been used in the cloning of the S. cerevisiae THI7 gene (15Enjo F. Nosaka K. Ogata M. Iwashima A. Nishimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19165-19170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Singleton C.K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We first crossed ptr1 mutants with nmt2Δ mutants and analyzed the tetrads. In all complete tetrads, the resistance against pyrithiamine segregated 2:2, indicating that it was caused by a single mutation. One pyrithiamine-resistant spore that combined the ptr1 and nmt2Δ mutations was used in the experiments described below. Consistent with a role of ptr1+ in thiamine uptake, the ptr1 nmt2"
