https://openalex.org/W2149556291,"Microelectrodes for electrophysiological use have been prepared easily and quickly by electrolytically sharpening platinum iridium alloy wire and coating with molten glass. The desirable combination of the electrical characteristics and strength of the platinum iridium wire with the exceptional durability of glass insulation has long been known, but earlier methods of fabrication were difficult and tedious."

Young age at the fault indicates that the accumulated defects in rocks were destroyed by high stress or high temperature at the time of the last fault movement, setting the clock time to zero. The technique was applied to quartz grains crushed by uniaxial compression in the laboratory to verify this interpretation."

At night, low wind speeds and unstable atmospheric conditions result in efficient vertical mixing of the air near the ground. Convective ascent of warm air imparts directionality to the pheromone- dispersion process. The occurrence of males at greater heights than pheromone- emitting conspecific females appears to be a mate-finding strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2091325959,Estimations of the calcium content of the mouse epidermis during the process of experimental carcinogenesis reveal two distinct phases: an immediate reduction in the calcium content which persists at a fairly constant level for many weeks and a further reduction when the epithelial cells have been transformed into cancer cells. Reduction of calcium in the hyperplastic epidermis is an important feature in this experimentally induced precancerous condition. This investigation was aided by grants from the International Cancer Research Foundation and the National Cancer Institute.

https://openalex.org/W2060751846,"Previous reports suggested that Glacier Peak, a volcano in northern Washington State, has been dormant for the past 11,000 years. New radiocarbon dates for volcanic deposits indicate that major volcanic events, such as tephra eruptions, pyroclastic flows, and mudflows traveling tens of kilometers, occurred at least five times in the past 1800 years and nine times in the past 5500 years."

https://openalex.org/W2068997707,A treelike model has been proposed for the structure of lignin. Kinetics of delignification are formulated to account for the cleavage of linkages along the linear primary chains and at the cross-links. Experimental data obtained from isothermal delignification are used to verify this theory. Good agreement has been obtained in calculating the delignification curves. Activation energies are found to be 172 kilojoules per mole of cross-links and 132 kilojoules per mole of aryl ether bonds.
https://openalex.org/W2042201574,"Careful analysis of x-ray scattering intensities of demineralized metaanthracites and high-rank anthracites formed during the Pennsylvanian geological period has revealed the presence of three-dimensional (hkl) reflections of graphite, demonstrating unequivocally that coals graphitize with metamorphism. Graphitization has been observed also with a coal formed before the Cambrian period, much earlier than most coals. A significant degree of graphitization occurs by coalification when the graphite-like layers attain a size of 25 to 30 angstroms as compared to 100 A or more by the heat treatment of amorphous carbons."
