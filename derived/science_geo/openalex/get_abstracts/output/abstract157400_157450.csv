https://openalex.org/W1977378846,"During phagocytosis, gp91 phox , the catalytic subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, becomes activated to produce superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal oxidants. Currently increasing evidence suggests that nonphagocytic cells contain similar superoxide-producing oxidases, which are proposed to play crucial roles in various events such as cell proliferation and oxygen sensing for erythropoiesis. Here we describe the cloning of human cDNA that encodes a novel NAD(P)H oxidase, designated NOX4. The NOX4 protein of 578 amino acids exhibits 39% identity to gp91 phox with special conservation in membrane-spanning regions and binding sites for heme, FAD, and NAD(P)H, indicative of its function as a superoxide-producing NAD(P)H oxidase. The membrane fraction of kidney-derived human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, expressing NOX4, exhibits NADH- and NADPH-dependent superoxide-producing activities, both of which are inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, an agent known to block oxygen sensing, and decreased in cells expressing antisense NOX4 mRNA. The human NOX4 gene, comprising 18 exons, is located on chromosome 11q14.2-q21, and its expression is almost exclusively restricted to adult and fetal kidneys. In human renal cortex, high amounts of the NOX4 protein are present in distal tubular cells, which reside near erythropoietin-producing cells. In addition, overexpression of NOX4 in cultured cells leads to increased superoxide production and decreased rate of growth. The present findings thus suggest that the novel NAD(P)H oxidase NOX4 may serve as an oxygen sensor and/or a regulator of cell growth in kidney.

On the other hand, organisms possess enzymatic systems that physiologically generate ROS. Among the systems to be well characterized is the superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase in mammalian professional phagocytes, which plays a crucial role in host defense against microbial infection (1Smith R.M.

The catalytic core of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is the membrane-integrated flavocytochrome b558, comprising the two subunits p22 phox and gp91 phox , the latter of which contains a complete electron-transferring apparatus (from NADPH to molecular oxygen) with binding sites for heme, FAD, and NADPH (5Rotrosen D.

The oxidase, dormant in resting cells, becomes activated during phagocytosis to generate superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal ROS. The activation requires the two specialized cytosolic proteins p47 phox and p67 phox , and the small GTPase Rac, all of which translocate upon cell stimulation to the membrane to interact with and activate the flavocytochrome (9Sumimoto H.

Such a strict regulation of the phagocyte oxidase activity is clearly important, since uncontrolled production of high amounts of ROS is injurious not only to phagocytes themselves but also to their surrounding tissues, and triggers inflammatory reaction (1Smith R.M.

Interestingly, alternative splicing of the oxidase NOH-1, equivalent to Mox1, generates a short isoform, which functions as a voltage-gated proton channel (27Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.-H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Considerable attention has been paid to an NAD(P)H oxidase in kidney; this organ highly expresses p22 phox , the small subunit of flavocytochrome b558 (28Sumimoto H. Nozaki M. Sasaki H. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Minakami S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), is susceptible to oxidative damage, suggestive of significance of ROS under pathological conditions (29Ueda N. Kaushal G.P. Shah S.V. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 403-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and plays a central role in erythropoiesis by synthesizing erythropoietin (EPO), which is regulated by an oxygen sensor (24Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Molecular nature of the kidney oxidase, however, has remained elusive. Here we describe the primary structure and function of a novel superoxide-producing NAD(P)H oxidase whose expression is almost exclusively restricted to adult and fetal human kidneys. We designate the novel oxidase NOX4 to avoid future confusion about the term, because Drs. Krause, Lambeth, and Lovering have recently established a consensus terminology for the NOX family of NAD(P)H oxidase: NOX1 for Mox1/NOH-1, NOX2 for gp91 phox , and NOX3 for the one, thus far only known from its genomic sequence (accession no.AL031773). 2K.-H. Krause, personal communication. -A search of EST data bases with the C-terminal region of human gp91 phox yielded a cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession no. AI742260). Using the EST clone as a template, we obtained the PCR product of 500 nucleotides with two unique oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GCTGGATCCCGAATGGTCAAAGAAAATTT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCTGAATTCATAGTCAGGTCTGTTCTCTTG-3′ (reverse primer). Here sequences from the EST clone are underlined. The PCR product was used as a probe for screening a human kidney cDNA library (Stratagene). Twelve independent positive clones were obtained from about 6 × 105 plaques, and sequenced in both directions. Among them, six clones encoded the full-length of NOX4. To determine the chromosomal localization of the human NOX4 gene, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (30Hirai M. Suto Y. Kanoh M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, a NOX4 cDNA fragment (corresponding to amino acids 1–578) was labeled with biotin-14-dATP by nick-translation and hybridized to R-banded chromosomes prepared from phytohemaggulutinin-stimulated cultured lymphocytes of normal donors. After overnight hybridization at 37 °C, the slides were washed in 50% formamide, 2× SSC at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by a wash in 1× SSC at room temperature for 15 min. Hybridization signals were amplified using rabbit anti-biotin IgG (Enzo) and fluorescein labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Enzo). The chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide. Sense and antisense cDNA encoding human NOX4 (amino acids 1–578) were subcloned into pREP10 (Invitrogen) or pEF-BOS (31Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), a generous gift form Dr. Shigekazu Nagata (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), for expression of the N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins. COS-7, HEK293, HeLa, or NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pREP10-NOX4, pREP10-antisense-NOX4, or empty pREP10 vector and/or pREP10-p22 phox , or with pEF-BOS-FLAG-tagged-NOX4 or pEF-BOS-antisense-NOX4, using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA fragments encoding the C-terminal domains of NOX proteins, NOX1 (amino acids 378–564), NOX2 (), and NOX4 (), were prepared by PCR, and the products were ligated to pGEX-2T or -4T (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by glutathione-Sepharose-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (9Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). An anti-human NOX4 rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the C-terminal 20 amino acid peptide of human NOX4. Purified proteins or membrane fractions of cells transfected with human NOX4 cDNA were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with the anti-human NOX4 antibody or anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The blots were developed using ECL-plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to visualize the antibodies. Total RNAs of HEK293, HeLa, KPK13 cells (32Naito S. Kanamori T. Hisano S. Tanaka K. Momose S. Kamata N. J. Urol. 1982; 128: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were perpared from with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and RT-PCR for NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 was performed with GeneAmp™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using specific primers: 5′-GATGATCGTGACTCCCAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CAACAATATTGCTGTCCC-3′ (reverse primer) for NOX1; 5′-GGGAAAAATAAAGGAATGCC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGCCAGTGAGGTAGATGTTG-3′ (reverse primer) for NOX2; 5′-GTCATAAGTCATCCCTCAGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TCAGCTGAAAGACTCTTTAT-3′ (reverse primer) for NOX4. HEK293 cells were lysed by sonication, and the sonicate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The resultant supernatant was further centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was used as the membrane fraction. Superoxide production by the membrane was determined as superoxide dismutase (SOD)-inhibitable chemiluminescence detected with an enhancer-containing luminol-based detection system (Diogenes™; National Diagnostics) as described previously (11Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Koga H. Terasawa H. Nunoi H. Takeshige K. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25051-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The membrane (5 μg of protein) was resuspended in 200 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 10 μmFAD, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm EGTA. After preincubation of the membrane solution with the enhanced luminol-based substrate (200 μl), NADH or NADPH was added at the final concentration of 0.5 mm. The chemiluminescence was assayed using a luminometer (Auto Lumat LB953; EG&G Berthold). The reaction was stopped by the addition of SOD (50 μg/ml). COS-7, HEK293, or NIH3T3 cells were seeded with 5.0 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates, and transfected with pREP10-NOX4 or pREP10-antisense-NOX4 by using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS for 56 h, and the cell number was determined photometrically using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma). Human Multiple Tissue Northern™ blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a32P-labeled NOX4 cDNA fragment, encoding the region that corresponds to amino acids 324–491, under high stringency conditions using ExpressHyb™ (CLONTECH). Localization of the NOX4 protein in human kidney was investigated by immunohistochemical study using renal tissue samples obtained by renal biopsy from patients, who were admitted to our hospital because of chance proteinuria or hematuria. All samples revealed neither glomerular and tubular abnormalities nor significant deposition in immunofluorescent study. Biopsy specimens were fixed in Bouin's solution and embedded in paraffin. The procedures of the use of the samples in the present study was in accordance with the guidelines of the local Human Subject Committee at Kyushu University (Fukuoka, Japan). Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously (33Tamaki K. Okuda S. Ando T. Iwamoto T. Nakayama M. Fujishima M. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 525-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, paraffin sections were cut at 3 μm, deparaffinized, and treated with 10 mm citrate, pH 6.0, in 800-watt microwave oven for 15 min for antigen retrieval before immunostaining. After inactivation of endogenous peroxidase with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min at room temperature, the sections were preincubated for 1 h with 5% dry milk and 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4). The samples were subsequently incubated with the anti-human NOX4 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) for overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, and probed with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Nichirei Corp., Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, the sections were reacted with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Nichirei Corp.) for 30 min at room temperature, and the sites of HRP were visualized with diaminobenzidine (Nichirei Corp.) and H2O2, and counterstained with hematoxylin for 2 min. A search of EST data bases with the C-terminal region of human NOX2/gp91 phox yielded a cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession no. AI742260). Using a DNA fragment of the EST clone as a probe, we screened a human kidney cDNA library and cloned a cDNA of ∼2.4 kb. The cDNA clone contains an open reading frame of 1,734 nucleotides with the first methionine codon surrounded by a consensus Kozak sequence, two in-frame preceding termination codons, and a consensus polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) present in the 3′-region (GenBank™ accession no. AB041035). The size of the cloned cDNA is identical to that of the major transcript of about 2.4 kb (see below), supporting that the obtained clone indeed contains the full-length cDNA. The predicted protein consists of 578 amino acids (Fig.1), with 39% and 35% identity to NOX2/gp91 phox and NOX1/Mox1, respectively. Regions, that are considered to be binding sites for FAD and pyridine nucleotide (5Rotrosen D. Yeung C. Leto T. Malech H. Kwong C.

A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), are nearly identical among the NOX proteins (Fig.1). Six putative membrane-spanning segments are also well conserved with four histidine residues that are proposed to be ligated to heme in NOX2/gp91 phox (8Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); His105 and His119 of the third segment, and His194 and His207 of the fifth one in NOX4. Since these features in the primary structure indicate the function as a superoxide-producing NAD(P)H oxidase, we designated the protein NOX4, a novel member of the NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) family. The human NOX2 gene consists of 13 exons, all with lengths similar to the 13 exons of the NOX1 gene (27Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.-H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To know genomic structure of the NOX4 gene, we screened a pooled human genomic library by PCR and obtained the BAC clone RP11–745I13 (GenBank accession no. AP002404), that contains exons 2–16 of NOX4. In addition, a data base search revealed that the two BAC clones RP11–345O16 and RP11–97D10 (GenBank accession nos.AC012198 and AP001815, respectively) also contain exons 1–7 and 3–18 of NOX4, respectively. The NOX4 gene comprises 18 exons, covering a minimum of 160 kb, and its organization is similar to those of NOX2 (Fig.2 A). To determine the chromosomal localization of the human NOX4gene, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, specific hybridization signals were observed on chromosome 11q14.2-q21, whereas no other hybridization sites were detected. Thus, the human NOX4 gene is located on chromosome 11q14.2-q21, while the human NOX1and NOX2 genes are located on chromosome Xq22 and Xp21.1, respectively (27Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.-H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We prepared an antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of human NOX4 as a tool for characterization of the NOX4 protein. As expected, the antibody interacted with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NOX4 expressed as a GST fusion protein, but not with that of NOX1/Mox1 or NOX2/gp91 phox (Fig.3 A). We next expressed NOX4 as a FLAG-tagged protein in COS-7 cells, and detected the protein by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 B, an anti-FLAG antibody bound to a protein with the apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa, the value which is essentially the same as the calculated molecular mass of NOX4. Additional two minor bands with much higher molecular masses were also observed on the blot (Fig. 3 B). The bands likely indicate dimer and/or oligomer(s) of NOX4, since they increased with concomitant decrease of the 66-kDa band when SDS-PAGE was performed under oxidized conditions (data not shown). The antibody to NOX4 only interacted with the same protein as that recognized by the anti-FLAG antibody, among proteins in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 B). These observations indicate that the antibody raised to the C terminus of human NOX4 specifically recognizes NOX4. We also tested effect of expression of p22 phox on the protein level of NOX4. The protein p22 phox is the heterodimeric partner of NOX2/gp91 phox in the cytochrome b558 complex of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, and is required for stabilization of NOX2: NOX2 is absent in phagocytes lacking p22 phox due to defect in the p22 phox gene (1Smith R.M.

Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with both NOX4 and p22 phox cDNAs did not alter the protein level of NOX4, compared with transfection with the NOX4 cDNA alone (data not shown). The finding raises a possibility that NOX4 may not be complexed with p22 phox , but does not exclude another one that NOX4 alone might be localized in an intracellular membrane compartment, but in the presence of p22 phox it may be incorporated into the plasma membrane in a heterodimeric form, a process which has recently been shown to occur in formation of the NOX2/gp91 phox –p22 phox heterodimer (34DeLeo F.R.

It is also possible that COS-7 cells may express an heretofore unidentified p22 phox homologue that could complex with NOX4. Using the membrane fraction of HeLa cells transfected with the NOX4 cDNA, we detected a protein band of about 75 kDa, in addition to the 66-kDa band, on Western blot (Fig. 3 C). The larger protein may be a glycosylated form of NOX4, since there exist four putative N-glycosylated sites in the second and third extracellular loops of NOX4: Asn129-Phe-Ser, Asn133-Tyr-Ser, Asn230-Arg-Thr, and Asn236-Ile-Ser (Fig. 1). The extent of glycosylation may be dependent on cell types; such a 75-kDa protein was not detected in COS-7 cells transfected with the NOX4 cDNA (Fig. 3 B). To obtain experimental evidence that NOX4 is glycosylated, we attempted to digest the 75-kDa protein by N-glycosidase F, which was unsuccessful. Since the NOX4 protein appears to have a tendency to self-aggregate (Fig. 3 B), targets for the glycosidase were possibly inaccessible. The final conclusion that NOX4 is glycosylated thus waits for further investigation. We searched for cultured cells expressing NOX4, and found that the human renal cell carcinoma KPK13 cells (32Naito S. Kanamori T. Hisano S. Tanaka K. Momose S. Kamata N. J. Urol. 1982; 128: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and HEK293 cells express both mRNA and protein of NOX4 by RT-PCR using specific primers (Fig.4 A) and by Western blot using the anti-NOX4 antibody (Fig. 4 B), respectively. Neither NOX1/Mox1 mRNA nor NOX2/gp91 phox mRNA was detected in HEK293 cells, while the former mRNA was expressed in KPK13 cells (Fig. 4 A). In contrast with these cells, human neutrophils exclusively expressed NOX2 (Fig. 4 A). Thus, HEK293 cells appear to be suitable for study on endogenous NOX4, since they express NOX4 but not other NOXs. To investigate function of the NOX4 protein, we prepared the membrane fraction of HEK293 cells and assayed its superoxide-producing activity. We initially used the cytochrome c reduction assay (9Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We could detect only small amounts of superoxide produced by the membrane fraction in the presence of NADH or NADPH: the rates were about or less than 0.5 nmol/min/106 cell equivalents of membrane, respectively, which are several 10-fold lower than the phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity in human neutrophil membranes (9Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Ago T. Nunoi H.

We next assayed superoxide production by the chemiluminescence method, which is much more sensitive to superoxide than the cytochrome c assay, but cannot be used for absolute quantitation. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the addition of NADH to the HEK293 membrane caused enhancement of chemiluminescence. The response was completely inhibited by SOD, indicating the involvement of superoxide. Analysis by this method further revealed that superoxide was also produced by NADPH; the maximal rate with NADH was approxi"

Because these cytokines are potent osteoclastogenic factors and because their signaling pathways are considerably overlapping, we postulated that under pro-inflammatory conditions RANKL and TNF might synergistically orchestrate enhanced osteoclastogenesis via cooperative mechanisms. We found TNF, via TNF type 1 receptor (TNFr1), prompts robust osteoclastogenesis by osteoclast precursors pretreated with RANKL, and deletion of TNFr1 abrogates this response. Enhanced osteoclastogenesis is associated with high expression of otherwise TNF and RANKL-induced mediators, including c-Src, TRAF2, TRAF6, and MEKK-1, levels of which were notably reduced in TNFr1 knockouts. Recruitment of TRAFs and MEKK1 leads to activation of downstream pathways, primarily IκB/NF-κB, ERKs, and cJun/AP-1. Consistent with impaired osteoclastogenesis and reduced expression of TRAFs and MEKK1, we found that phosphorylation and activation of IκB, NF-κB, ERKs, and cJun/AP-1 are severely reduced in RANKL-treated TNFr1-null osteoclast precursors compared with wild type counterparts. Finally, we found that TNF and RANKL synergistically up-regulate RANK expression in wild type precursors, whereas basal and stimulated levels of RANK are significantly lower in TNFr1 knockout cells. Our data suggest that exuberant TNF-induced osteoclastogensis is the result of coupling between RANK and TNFr1 and is dependent upon signals transmitted by the latter receptor.

Recent evidence points out that RANKL is also secreted by T helper 1 lymphocytes, the cells responsible for secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1 (12Kong Y.Y. Fiege U. Sarosi I. Bolon B. Tafuri A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Li J. Elliot R. McCabe S. Wong T. Moran E. Lacey D.L. Fish E. Boyle W. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). More importantly, a direct role of T cell secreted RANKL in promoting joint inflammation, bone, and cartilage destruction has been established (12Kong Y.Y. Fiege U. Sarosi I. Bolon B. Tafuri A.

Thus, RANKL and TNF may orchestrate bone and tissue dissolution in inflammatory bone diseases. In general, TNF receptor family members when activated recruit TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins to their cytoplasmic tail. Acting as adaptor proteins, TRAFs bind to and activate several downstream tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, including c-Src, Akt/PKB, and MEKK-1. These in turn prompt activation, primarily via phosphorylation events, of a signalsome-residing molecules, such as (a) activation of IκB kinase ≫ IκB ≫ NF-κB pathway, (b) MEKK1 ≫ MEK ≫ ERK, and (c) MEKK1 ≫ JNK ≫ c-Jun/AP-1. RANKL transmits its signal via a member of the TNF receptor family, RANK (15Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.-L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Wang L.

A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The complete repertoire of RANK intracellular signaling is unclear; however, similar to other TNF receptors, it recruits members of the TRAF adapter proteins and activates AP-1 and NF-κB (16Darnay B.G.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28335-28359Google Scholar). Activation of these transcription factors entails phosphorylation of inhibitory proteins followed by release and nuclear translocation of the transcription factors. Thus, a considerable overlap exists in the signal transduction pathways transmitted by RANKL and TNF receptors. TNF (18Vilcek J. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) recognizes two receptors: TNFr1 (also known as p55) and TNFr2 (also known as p75) (20Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that TNFr1 promotes osteoclastogenesis (21Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Abu-Amer Y. Erdmann J. Alexopoulou L. Kollias G. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27307-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas TNFr2 is inhibitory. Among the important events following TNF and RANKL occupancy of their respective receptors, as already mentioned, are mobilization of NF-κB and c-Jun/AP-1 (16Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17Wong B.R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol.

The pivotal role that NF-κB plays in osteoclast recruitment is established by the fact that mice lacking both the p50 and p52 NF-κB subunits develop a form of osteopetrosis in which the animal is completely devoid of osteoclasts (24Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Young Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 25Abu-Amer Y. Tondravi M.M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1189-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, ablation of the c-fos component of AP-1 resulted in a similar osteopetrotic bone phenotype (26Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.-Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Finally, dominant-negative blockade of ERK signaling dampens osteoclastogenesis (27Miyazaki T. Katagiri K. Kanegae K. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M. Asano T. Verma I. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that inflammatory osteolysis reflects TNF-induced recruitment of osteoclasts that resorb alveolar bone leading to edentulism (21Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Abundant RANKL in sites of bone erosion further suggests that local differentiation and activation of osteoclasts by pro-inflammatory cytokine is a likely occurring event. Because TNF is also abundant in inflamed bone sites and plays a major role in progression of the disease, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which this inflammatory cytokine accelerates RANK-induced osteoclastogenesis will provide the basis for prevention of inflammatory bone osteolysis. In this study, we show that TNF closely regulates RANK/RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. TNF markedly accelerates basal osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL via its TNFr1. We also find that RANKL and TNF ultimately induce expression and recruitment of TRAF2, TRAF6, MEKK-1, and c-Src. These events led to TNFr1-dependent activation of NF-κB, ERK, and c-Jun/AP-1, induction of RANK, and osteoclastogenesis. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant murine TNF and M-CSF were purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). RANKL was produced in Escherichia coli by fusion of the region from lysine 158 to the C terminus of the mouse cDNA to thioredoxin and will be described in detail elsewhere. ECL kit was obtained from Pierce. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. C3H/HeN males were purchased from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN). Knockout mice for TNF receptors p55 and p75 and their wild type controls were provided by Drs. Warner Lesslauer (Hoffman-LaRoche) and Mark Moore (Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA), respectively. Bone marrow macrophages were isolated from whole bone marrow of 4–6-week-old mice and incubated in tissue culture plates, at 37 °C in 5% CO2, in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF (28Clohisy D.R. Chappel J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5370-5377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h in culture, the nonadherent cells were collected and layered on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. Cells at the gradient interface were collected and plated in α-minimum essential medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF, and plated according to each experimental conditions. Purified marrow macrophages were cultured at 1 × 106 cells/ml in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 20 ng/ml RANKL for 4 days. Cultures were supplemented with M-CSF and RANKL on day 2 of culture. Total cell lysates were boiled in the presence of 2× SDS-sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, distilled water) for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad) and incubated in blocking solution (10% skim milk prepared in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) to reduce nonspecific binding. Membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween buffer and exposed to primary antibodies (1 h at room temperature up to overnight at 4 °C), washed again four times, and incubated with the respective secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1 h, room temperature). Membranes were washed extensively (5 × 15 min), and an ECL detection assay was performed following the manufacturer's directions. Nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (30Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol.

In brief, monolayers of bone marrow macrophages grown in 100-mm2 tissue culture dish were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lifted from the dish by treating with 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 15 min, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.64%. Nuclei were pelleted, and the cytosolic fraction was carefully removed. The nuclei were then resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), vortexed for 30 s and rotated for 30 min in 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged, the nuclear proteins in the supernatant were transferred to fresh tubes, and protein content was measured using standard BCA kit (Pierce). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with an end-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the sequence 5′-AAA CAG GGG GCT TTC CCT CCT C-3′ (32Drouet C. Shakhov A.N. Jongeneel C.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1694-1700PubMed Google Scholar) derived from the κB3 site of the TNF promoter or with commercial cJun/AP-1 oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz). The reaction was performed in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then fractionated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposing dried gel to film. We have shown that TNF stimulates osteoclastogenesis in whole marrow cultures and in co-culture of osteoclast precursors with stromal cells (21Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Abu-Amer Y. Erdmann J. Alexopoulou L. Kollias G. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27307-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basal osteoclastogenesis in these two systems was induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Given the presence of both stromal and osteoclast precursors in those cultures, it is not clear which cell type is targeted by TNF. To address this issue, a pure population of osteoclast precursors, in the form of monocytes/macrophages, was cultured in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF for 4 days. Cells were then treated with carrier or TNF for 24 h, after which cultures were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, a hallmark of osteoclasts (21Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We found that TNF dramatically enhances basal osteoclastogenesis by RANKL-induced bone marrow macrophages (Fig. 1). A 4–5-fold increase in the number of multi-nucleated osteoclasts and a 4–12-fold increase in cell size were observed. The average number of osteoclasts in RANKL-treated wild type cultures (quadruplicate wells ± S.D.,n = 3) was 134 ± 21 compared with 732 ± 115 in RANKL + TNF-treated cells (p < 0.001). TNF transmits its biological signals via two receptors, TNFr1 and TNFr2, and we have shown previously that TNFr1 is the pro-osteoclastic moiety (21Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Abu-Amer Y. Erdmann J. Alexopoulou L. Kollias G. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27307-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using cells derived from mice lacking individual TNF receptor, we found that cells deleted of TNFr1 generate far less osteoclasts in response to RANKL than their wild type counterparts (52 ± 14 versus 134 ± 21, respectively;p < 0.005) (Fig. 1). More importantly, addition of TNF to wild type cells while generating exuberant osteoclast response overnight (top right panel), it failed to impact osteoclastogenesis by TNFr1-null cells (middle right panel). Number of osteoclasts in RANKL-treated TNFr1 conditions was 52 ± 14, which was statistically not different from the number of osteoclasts from TNFr1 treated with RANKL and TNF (61 ± 21 osteoclasts). Furthermore, size and multi-nucleation of osteoclasts in TNFr1 knockout cells were not affected by TNF treatment. In contrast, osteoclastogenesis by cells lacking TNFr2 yet expressing TNFr1 resumed in a similar manner seen in wild type cells (bottom panels). Consistent with our previous observations (22Abu-Amer Y. Erdmann J. Alexopoulou L. Kollias G. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27307-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found an increased number of osteoclasts (189 ± 17) from TNFr2 mice in basal conditions (+RANKL), which was dramatically increased with TNF addition (847 ± 79, p < 0.001). Increased basal and TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis by TNFr2-null cells is consistent with the role of this receptor as an osteoclast suppressor (22Abu-Amer Y. Erdmann J. Alexopoulou L. Kollias G. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27307-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further enforces the requirement of TNFr1 for normal osteoclastogenesis. We next turned to investigate the molecular pathway(s) by which TNF accelerates RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Signaling of TNF and RANKL requires recruitment of TRAFs and activation of subsequent kinases. Thus, we examined the expression of these proteins in osteoclasts differentiated in vitro compared with their precursors. We found that osteoclasts express elevated levels of TRAF2, TRAF6, c-Src, and MEKK-1, whereas expression of these proteins by untreated precursor cells was negligible (Fig.2 A). Contrary to that, we found that expression of these proteins in TNFr1-null osteoclasts is reduced. These data are consistent with the pro-osteoclastic role of TNFr1. Having established the expression levels of TRAF2, TRAF6, and MEKK1 in osteoclasts, we examined expression of these proteins in precursor cells in response to RANKL, TNF, and other pro-osteoclastic agents following 24 h of treatment. We found that expression of TRAF2, TRAF6, and MEKK1 is highly induced in wild type cells by RANKL, TNF, and pro-osteoclastic agents, such as lipopolysaccharide and IL-1 (Fig.2 B). These observations point out that expression of these proteins is likely essential for osteoclast differentiation evident by their reduced expression in TNFr1-null osteoclasts, which were poorly generated with RANKL (Fig. 2 A). These findings further support the possibility that TNFr1 is essential for TNF-enhanced activation of the RANK/RANKL pathway. Recruitment of TRAF2, TRAF6, and MEKK1 to the cytoplasmic tail of TNF receptor family members facilitates binding and activation of multiple downstream kinases. These in turn, lead to activation of (a) MEKK1 ≫ JNK ≫ c-Jun/AP-1, (b) MEKK1 ≫ MEK ≫ ERK, and (c) TRAFs ≫ IκB kinases ≫ IκB ≫ NF-κB signaling pathways, all of which are essential for osteoclast differentiation and survival (24Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Young Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 26Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.-Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 27Miyazaki T. Katagiri K. Kanegae K. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M. Asano T. Verma I. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether, similar to the impaired TRAFs and MEKK1 expression observed in TNFr1-null cells, one or more of these downstream pathways are also impaired. To this end we first examined expression and phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 in RANKL-treated wild type and TNFr1 knockout cells. Activation of MEK1 is manifested by its phosphorylation, at least in part by MEKK1. MEK1 then phosphorylates ERK1/2, leading to their dimerization and nuclear translocation. Reflecting reduced expression of MEKK1 in RANKL-generated TNFr1-null osteoclasts, we found that MEK1 phosphorylation induced by RANKL is significantly reduced in TNFr1-null compared with wild type cells (Fig.3 A). Hypophosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase is specific because MEK1 protein was equally expressed in all conditions. Similarly, we found that ERK1/2 proteins are equally expressed in both cell types (Fig.3 B), and their expression is unaffected by the addition of RANKL. Interestingly, however, and despite the equal expression of the protein in both cell types, phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases resembled that observed with the upstream kinase MEK1. Namely, although ERK1/2 undergo rapid phosphorylation within 10 min, which is sustained up to 4 h after exposure to RANKL, little or no phosphorylation was observed in RANKL-treated TNFr1-null cells. Residual and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in TNFr1 knockout cells was detected only after 40 min of exposure to RANKL. This finding correlates well with reduced expression of MEKK1 in TNFr1-null osteoclasts (generated with RANKL) (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, given the established role of ERK activation as essential for osteoclast activation and survival (27Miyazaki T. Katagiri K. Kanegae K. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M. Asano T. Verma I. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), these findings support the notion that TNFr1 is required for normal osteoclastogenesis. MEKK-1, via JNK, also leads to c-Jun phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we provide evidence that c-Jun is activated in osteoclast precursors induced by RANKL (Fig. 4). More importantly, we found that activation of c-Jun/AP-1 by RANKL is severely reduced in TNFr1-null compared with wild type cells. Mirroring its pro-osteoclastic effect (Fig. 1), TNF alone, although activating the transcription factor in wild type cells as expected (Fig. 4,lanes 6 and 7), fails to trigger such response in TNFr1-null cells (Fig. 4, lanes 12–14). Lack of transcription factor activation in TNFr1-null cells is in keeping with its principal role in induction of RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. NF-κB is essential for osteoclast formation. Activation of this transcription factor is a consequence of IκB phosphorylation and dissociation of the IκB/NF-κB complex followed by nuclear translocation of NF-κB and binding to DNA (23Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). We have documented that expression of the adaptor proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 is impaired in RANKL-generated TNFr1 knockout osteoclasts (Fig.2), a phenomenon consistent with reduced osteoclastogenesis by the same cells (Fig. 1). Thus, we asked whether reduced osteoclastogenesis in RANKL-treated TNFr1-null cells also reflect impaired NF-κB activation, a process mediated through TRAF protein recruitment (23Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). First, we document that RANKL induces rapid phosphorylation of IκB manifested by the indicated slow migrating band (Fig.5 A, IκB-p). This phosphorylation persists for 2 h and diminishes after 3 h. Reflecting IκB phosphorylation, our data show that similar to TNF, RANKL activates NF-κB in wild type cells, evidenced by increased DNA binding activity with time (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–4). In contrast and enforcing the role of TNFr1 in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, we found that IκB is hypophosphorylated (Fig.5 A) and that NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity are severely reduced in cells lacking TNFr1 (Fig.5 B, lanes 8–14). Interestingly, in TNFr1-null cells, activation of NF-κB was severely reduced in the presence of RANKL and absent following TNF treatment. These data, once again, highlight the essential role of TNFr1 as an activator of NF-κB, a transcription factor critical for osteoclast formation. Thus far, our data indicate that signaling of osteoclastogenesis by TNFr1 and RANK is seemingly overlapping, and activation of TNFr1-dependent events accelerates RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. More specifically, deletion of TNFr1 dampens RANKL-induced expression, phosphorylation, and activation of key proteins required for normal osteoclastogenesis, such as TRAFs, MEKK1, c-Src, IκB, NF-κB, AP-1/c-Jun, and ERK proteins. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that endogenous TNFr1 signaling regulates RANK expression/function. To address this issue, we examined RANK expression by TNFr1-null cells. To this end, marrow macrophages from wild type and TNFr1-null cells were cultured for 4 days in the absence or presence of RANKL, and levels of RANK expression were assessed by immunoblots. We found that expression of RANK is reduced in the absence of TNFr1 (Fig. 6,lanes 1–4) and remain low in the presence of RANKL and/or TNF (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, levels of RANK were elevated in wild type cells (Fig. 6, lane 5) and were synergistically increased when treated with RANKL and TNF (lane 8). These observations suggest that signals transmitted by the TNFr1, likely to be NF-κB and/or AP-1-dependent genes, regulate RANK expression. Osteoclastogenesis is mediated via ligation of RANKL to its transmembranal receptor, RANK (13Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T. Elliott R. Colombero A. Elliott G.

Furthermore, osteoclast recruitment and activation is markedly induced in states of inflammatory bone diseases (5Wagner S. Fritz P. Einsele H. Sell S. Saal J.G. Rheumatol.

The recent discovery of RANK signaling pathway in osteoclasts and their precursors enables us to investigate the direct effect, if any, of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors on RANK-induced osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we established that TNF acts directly on osteoclast precursors, thus providing a clear target to prevent TNF signaling in states of bone inflammation. Similar to TNF, RANKL signaling involves recruitment and activation of key proteins essential for osteoclastogenesis, some of which include TRAFs, MEKK1, c-Src, IκB kinases, ERKs, c-Jun, and NF-κB (16Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17Wong B.R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28335-28359Google Scholar). The obvious overlap between TNF and RANKL stimulation of their respective pathways, their abundance in sites of bone inflammation, and their documented pro-osteoclastic role prompted us to investigate possible cooperative signaling between TNF receptors and RANK with regard to events leading to osteoclastogenesis. We found that levels of TRAF2, TRAF6, and MEKK1 are increased in response to treatment of precursor cells with osteoclastic agents, such as RANKL, TNF, IL-1, and lipopolysaccharide, and parallel their high level of expression in differentiated osteoclasts. Interestingly, and in support of its essential role in osteoclastogenesis (35Lomaga M.A. Yeh M.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. Itie A. Wakeham A.

Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), we found expression of TRAF6 is significantly higher than TRAF2. In any case, expression of TRAF2 and TRAF6 by RANKL or TNF-treated macrophages and high expression of these factors in fully differentiated osteoclasts is in keeping with their essential role for c-Jun and NF-κB activation, respectively (37Baud V. Liu Z.-G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 38Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Similar to our previous findings that TNF mobilizes and activates c-Src (21Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 30Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we show in this report that expression of the tyrosine kinase is elevated in RANKL-generated osteoclasts. We also report that RANKL induces expression of the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase, MEKK-1. MEKK-1 normally binds to and is activated by TRAF2 (37Baud V. Liu Z.-G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In its activated form, MEKK-1 induces and activates, among other functions, the JNK and MEK1, leading to c-Jun/AP-1 and ERK activation, respectively (37Baud V. Liu Z.-G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it is reasonable to propose that RANKL-activated pathways converge at the level of TRAF adapter proteins. According to this scenario and consistent with previous observations (36Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 37Baud V. Liu Z.-G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), TRAF6-c-Src complex leads to NF-κB activation, whereas TRAF2-MEKK1 primarily activates the ERK and c-Jun pathways. These pathways are not entirely distinct because of cross-talk at different stages (39Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y.K. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar,40Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). By analogy to RANKL and using similar mechanisms, TNF is capable of inducing NF-κB and c-Jun/AP-1 (20Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 23Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). TNF exerts its effects via two receptors, TNFr1 and TNFr2. Both receptors share functional properties, but it is the TNFr1 that has been implicated as pro-osteoclastic (21Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Abu-Amer Y. Erdmann J. Alexopoulou L. Kollias G. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27307-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although its direct RANKL-independent osteoclastogenic potential remains disputed (41Li J. Sarosi I. Yan X.Q. McCabe S.M. Morony S. Elliot R. Haufmann S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: S149Google Scholar, 42Kobayashi K. Takahashi N. Jimi E. Udagawa N. Takami M. Kotake S. Nakagawa N. Shima N. Yasuda H. Higashio K. Martin T.J. Suda T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), our data indicate that TNF exerts robust osteoclastogenesis by RANKL-primed pre-osteoclasts. Supporting this observation is our finding that deletion of the TNFr1 attenuates endogenous and in vitroRANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis subsequent to reduced NF-κB, ERK, and cJun/AP-1 activation. Reduced activation of NF-κB, ERKs, and cJun/AP-1 in TNFr1 knockout cells is most likely secondary to hypophosphorylation of upstream regulatory proteins, such as IκB, MEK, and JNK, two of which are documented in this study. These impaired signals appear to be TNFr1-dependent, because basal osteoclastogenesis resumes in TNFr1-expressing TNFr2-null cells in a manner greater than that seen by their wild type counterparts. The most challenging of our findings is the endogenous effect of TNF on RANK-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Although equal amounts of total protein were examined, expression levels of RANK were very little in TNFr1-null cells compared with wild type controls. Interestingly, administration of either TNF or RANKL has little or no impact on RANK expression in both species. In contrast, combined addition of TNF and RANKL, while eliciting no effect on TNFr1-null cells, synergistically induce RANK expression within 24 h. Thus, regulation of RANK is under the aegis of TNFr1 and requires preactivation with RANKL. First, our findings point out that basal osteoclast formation by RANKL is reduced in the absence of TNFr1. Thus, endogenous expression of this receptor is essential to maintain higher level of osteoclastic pool. Further treatment with TNF of cells derived from the TNFr1-null mice fails to augment osteoclastogenesis. Second, examination of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors in TNFr1-null nuclear extracts points to reduced DNA binding of both factors compared with wild type-derived cells. This finding mirrors reduced osteoclastogenesis by TNFr1-null cells. These observations are in keeping with the essential role of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors in osteoclast differentiation and activation (16Darnay B.G. Ni J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20551-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17Wong B.R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26396-26401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the finding that TNFr1 transmits signals that up-regulate RANK expression and support osteoclastogenesis favorably argues that RANK gene expression may be regulated by NF-κB and/or AP-1 transcriptional machinery. In conclusion, our findings suggest that overlapping signaling mechanisms of RANKL and TNF result in exuberant osteoclastogenesis and may mediate severe bone resorption. TNFr1 is required for both basal RANK expression/signaling and for the cytokine-enhanced phase of osteoclastogenesis. We thank Dr. John Clohisy for critical reading of the manuscript."

These proteins and their homologs in other mammalian species comprise two previously unrecognized families of integral membrane proteins (CNT and ENT) with quite different predicted architectural designs (3Cass C.E.

The relationships of these NT proteins to the processes defined by functional studies are: CNT1 (cit), CNT2 (cif), ENT1 (es), and ENT2 (ei). Although the NT protein(s) responsible for mammalian cibhave remained elusive, we have recently identified a CNT protein withcib-type transport activity from the ancient marine vertebrate, the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stouti) (18Loewen S.K.

Human and rat CNT1 (650 and 648 residues, 71 kDa), designated hCNT1 and rCNT1, respectively, are 83% identical in amino acid sequence (8Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E.

Zhang Y. Gallagher M.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), in contrast, is a smaller protein with 27% identity to mammalian CNTs, with the major difference being the absence of the equivalents of TM 1–3 and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the other proteins. In structure/function studies, the characteristics of hCNT1/2 chimeras and sequence comparisons between h/rCNTs and hfCNT have identified two sets of adjacent residues in TMs 7 and 8 of hCNT1 that, when converted to the corresponding residues in hCNT2, changed the specificity of the transporter from cit to cif (18Loewen S.K.

Mutation of the two residues in TM 7 alone produced a protein with intermediate,cib-like activity. In this cit/cibconversion, mutation of hCNT1 Ser319 to Gly was sufficient to enable transport of purine nucleosides, whereas mutation of the adjacent residue Gln320 to Met (which had no effect on its own) augmented this transport. TMs 7 and 8 have also been identified as potential determinants of substrate selectivity in rCNT1/2 (21Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and mutation of rCNT1 Ser318 (the rat counterpart of hCNT1 Ser319) resulted in a cib-type phenotype similar to that seen with the hCNT1 Ser319 mutation (22Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2298-2302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although an earlier study had identified a member of the SGLT glucose transporter family, SNST1, as a candidate cib-type transporter (23Pajor A.M. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3557-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its nucleoside-transport activity is very low, and we hypothesized that the missing mammalian concentrative NT was more likely to be a CNT transporter. Following a search for additional mammalian CNT isoforms, we now report the cDNA cloning of new human and mouse members of the CNT transporter family. The encoded proteins, designated hCNT3 and mCNT3, respectively, exhibit strongcib-type functional activity when expressed inXenopus oocytes and have primary structures that place them together with hfCNT in a CNT subfamily separate from h/rCNT1/2. BLAST searches of CNT sequences in the GenBankTM data base identified overlapping human ESTs from mammary gland (AI905993) and colon adenocarcinoma (AW083022) different from established members of the CNT transporter family. Together, they formed a composite cDNA fragment 807 bp in length with an open reading frame of 245 residues followed by 69 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. The cDNA was 62% identical in nucleotide sequence to corresponding regions of the hCNT1 (U62968) and hCNT2 (AF036109) cDNAs and 68% identical to the hfCNT (AF132298) cDNA. The encoded amino acid sequence was 79% identical to the carboxyl terminus of hfCNT and 58 and 62% identical, respectively, to hCNT1 and hCNT2. These indications of a novel human CNT distinct from hCNT1 and hCNT2 were tested by RT-PCR in a panel of total RNA samples from human mammary gland, small intestine, kidney (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and liver (13Ritzel M.W.L. Yao S.Y.M. Ng A.M.L. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1998; 15: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because the close sequence similarity between the EST composite sequence and hfCNT suggested that the new CNT might correspond to system cib, we also performed RT-PCR on differentiated human myeloid HL-60 cells, a source of functionalcib-type transport activity (see below). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript Preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) as primer. The PCR reaction (30 μl) contained 50 ng of template first-strand cDNA, 2.5 units of Taq-DeepVent DNA polymerase (100:1) and 10 pmol each of the 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAAACATGTTTGACTACCCACAG-3′ and 5′-GTGGAGTTGAAGGCATTCTCTAAAACGT-3′. Amplification for one cycle at 94 °C for 55 s, 54 °C for 55 s, and 72 °C for 70 s, two cycles at 94 °C for 55 s, 55 °C for 55 s, and 72 °C for 70 s, and 30 cycles at 94 °C for 55 s, 58 °C for 55 s, and 72 °C for 70 s (Robocycler™ 40 Temperature Cycler, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) generated visible PCR products of the predicted size (480 bp) from four of the samples (differentiated HL-60 cells, mammary gland, small intestine, and liver). We extended the partial EST cDNA sequence by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends amplification of mRNA from differentiated HL-60 cells using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Poly(A)+-selected RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to degrade 5′-truncated transcripts, followed by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to remove cap from the remaining full-length mRNAs. A synthetic RNA adaptor from the kit was then ligated to the full-length 5′-monophosphate transcript population using T4 RNA ligase, followed by first strand cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) as primer. For the initial PCR, the 5′-primer was the outer adaptor primer provided by the kit and the gene-specific 3′-primer was 5′-GATATATATTGCTGCACACCGTTTACAA-3′. Amplification byTaq-DeepVent DNA polymerase (100:1) was for 40 cycles at 94 °C for 55 s, 65 °C for 55 s, and 72 °C for 3 min and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min, the reaction mixture being heated to 94 °C for 1 min before addition of the Taq-DeepVent DNA polymerase mixture. The PCR reaction mixture was resolved on a 1% agarose gel, and faint bands between 1.5 and 2.0 kb in size were isolated and purified (QIAEX II Gel Extraction kit; Qiagen Inc.). This product was then reamplified by nested PCR (35 cycles at 94 °C for 55 s, 65 °C for 55 s, and 72 °C for 3 min and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min) using an inner 5′-primer from the kit and the gene-specific 3′-primer 5′-TTAGCTCAAAACTCAGCTGTGGGTAGTC-3′. A defined band of ∼1.7 kb was isolated, cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced by Taq DyeDeoxyterminator cycle sequencing using an automated model 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The inset overlapped the 807-bp EST sequence by 114 bp and generated an additional 1633 bp of upstream sequence. The new composite 2440-bp sequence was 66% identical to the hfCNT cDNA and contained an open reading frame of 691 amino acids. cDNAs containing the complete coding sequence were then obtained by RT-PCR from differentiated HL-60 cells and mammary gland, as described previously, using 5′- and 3′-primers flanking the open reading frame (5′-CTAAATGAAGAGCGCTTGGGACCT-3′ and 5′-AGCATCTGTACTTCAGAGTTCCACTGG-3′). The resulting ∼2.2-kb products were ligated into pGEM-T and sequenced in both directions to give identical 691-residue open reading frames flanked by 92 bp of 5′-untranslated nucleotide sequence and 41 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. As expected from their identical nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences, there was no difference in hCNT3 transport function between cDNA clones isolated from HL-60 cells or mammary gland. Radioisotope transport studies reported in this paper were performed with the HL-60 clone in pGEM-T. BLAST searches of mouse ESTs in the GenBankTM data base identified 630- and 635-bp sequences from two mammary gland IMAGE clones with 73 and 83% sequence identity to parts of the hCNT3 cDNA sequence. IMAGE clone 1514965 aligned with the 5′-coding region, whereas 1515408 ended 54 bp short of the predicted stop codon. Both clones were obtained from the IMAGE Consortium through the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). PCR showed that they were incomplete, and sequencing of 1515408 gave an additional 85 bp of sequence to complete the 3′-end of the open reading frame. A cDNA with the complete coding sequence was then obtained by RT-PCR from mouse liver RNA (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) with 5′-primer 5′-AGGATGTCCAGGGCAGACCCGGGAAAGA-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-AGATCACAATTTATTAGGGATCCAATTG-3′. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the Thermoscript RT-PCR System (Life Technologies, Inc.), and amplification by Taq-DeepVent DNA polymerase (100:1) was for 2 cycles at 94 °C for 2 min, 64 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min, 2 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min, and one final extension cycle for 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting ∼2.0-kb product was ligated into pGEM-T and subcloned into the enhanced Xenopusexpression vector pGEM-HE (24Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Each was sequenced in both directions, giving identical 703-amino acid residue open reading frames flanked by short 3-bp regions of 5′-untranslated or 3′-nucleotide sequence. By providing additional 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences from aXenopus β-globin gene, the pGEM-HE construct gave greater functional activity and was used in subsequent transport characterization of the mouse protein. pGEM-HE was also used for electrophysiological studies of hCNT3. hCNT3 and mCNT3 plasmid DNAs were linearized withNotI (pGEM-T) or NheI (pGEM-HE) and transcribed with T7 polymerase mMESSAGE mMACHINETM (Ambion). Stage VI oocytes of Xenopus laevis (8Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol.

Transport was traced using the appropriate 14C/3H-labeled nucleoside, nucleoside drug, or nucleobase (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a concentration of 1 and 2 μCi/ml for 14C-labeled and 3H-labeled compounds, respectively. [3H]Gemcitabine (2′,3′-difluorodeoxycytidine) was a gift from Eli Lilly Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Radiochemicals were 98–99% pure (see HL-60 transport studies). Flux measurements were performed at room temperature (20 °C) as described previously (8Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol.

Except where otherwise indicated, the nucleoside concentration was 20 μm. At the end of the incubation period, extracellular label was removed by six rapid washes in ice-cold transport medium, and individual oocytes were dissolved in 5% (w/v) SDS for quantitation of oocyte-associated radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (LS 6000 IC; Beckman). Initial rates of transport (influx) were determined using an incubation period of 5 min (8Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol.

Choline replaced sodium in Na+ dependence experiments, and the transport medium for adenosine uptake contained 1 μm deoxycoformycin to inhibit adenosine deaminase activity. The flux values shown are the means ± S.E. of 10–12 oocytes, and each experiment was performed at least twice on different batches of cells. Kinetic (K m and V max) and Na+ activation parameters (K 50 and Hill coefficient) ± S.E. were determined using ENZFITTER (Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) and SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software, respectively. Oocytes were voltage clamped using the two-electrode voltage clamp. Membrane currents were measured at room temperature by use of a GeneClamp 500B oocyte clamp (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances that ranged from 1–2.5 mΩ. The GeneClamp 500B was interfaced to a computer via a Digidata 1200 A/D convertor and controlled by Axoscope software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Current signals were filtered at 20 Hz (four-pole Bessel filter) and sampled at intervals of 20 ms. For data presentation, the signals were further filtered at 0.5 Hz by use of pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments). Cells were not used if resting membrane potentials were unstable or less than −30 mV. For measurements of hCNT3-generated currents, oocyte membrane potentials were clamped at −50 mV. Oocytes were perfused with the same medium used for radioisotope flux studies, and transport assays were initiated by changing the substrate-free solution to one containing nucleoside (200 μm). In experiments examining Na+ dependence, sodium in the medium was replaced by choline. The human promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, was propagated as suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum using reagents purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Stock cultures were maintained in 5% CO2 without antibiotics at 37 °C, subcultured every 3–4 days and demonstrated to be mycoplasma-free. Cell numbers were determined using a Coulter Counter model Z2 (Coulter Electronics Inc., Luton, UK). To induce differentiation, HL-60 cells (3 × 106) growing in logarithmic phase were placed in 10-cm Falcon Primaria tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson) in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (200 ng/ml) (Sigma) freshly dissolved in acetone. After 48 h, the plates were washed once with transport buffer (see below) to remove nonadherent cells and then incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of 100 μm dilazep. Transport assays were performed on the remaining adherent cells. Total RNA and mRNA were prepared from exponentially growing parent and adherent HL-60 cells using the RNeasy Mini Protocol (Qiagen) and Fast Track 2.0 Isolation kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. Nucleoside uptake by differentiated HL-60 cells was measured as described previously (25Graham K.A. Leithoff J. Coe I.R. Mowles D. Mackey J.R. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2000; 19: 415-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by exposing replicate cultures at room temperature to3H-labeled permeant (10 μm, 1 μCi/ml) in sodium or sodium-free transport medium (130 mm NaCl or 130 mm NMDG/HCl and 3 mmK2HPO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris/HCl, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Radiochemicals (Moravek Biochemicals) were 98–99% pure as assessed by high performance liquid chromatography using water-methanol gradients on a C18 reverse phase column, and transport for timed intervals of 1–6 min was terminated by immersion of the culture dish in an excess volume of ice-cold transport solution. Assays to detect concentrative transport were performed in the presence of 100 μm dilazep (a gift from Hoffman La Roche & Co., Basel, Switzerland) to block equilibrative transport of the test nucleoside. Transport by nonadherent parental HL-60 cells was performed as described previously (26Boleti H. Coe I.R. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 38: 1167-1179Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the inhibitor oil stop method. Values are presented as the means of triplicate measurements ± S.D. A human multiple tissue expression (MTETM) RNA array (CLONTECH) and dot blots of mRNA (0.5 μg) from parent and differentiated HL-60 cells on BrightStar-Plus nylon transfer membrane (Ambion) were incubated with a cDNA probe corresponding to hCNT3 amino acid residues 359–549 labeled with32P using the T7QuickPrime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization at high stringency (68 °C) was performed using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) and 100 μg/ml of sheared herring sperm DNA. Wash conditions were as described in the CLONTECH ExpressHyb user manual. Signals on exposed blots were converted to a high resolution tiff image (Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4C) and quantified using the public domain NIH Image program, version 1.60. For Northern analysis, 5-μg samples of mRNA from human pancreas, bone marrow, trachea, intestine, liver, brain, heart, and kidney (CLONTECH) were separated on a 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gel, blotted on to BrightStar-Plus nylon transfer membrane, and hybridized with the same hCNT3 probe (residues 359–549) under identical high stringency conditions. Possible cross-hybridization between CNT family members was tested on dot blots of dilutions (0.5 μg-5 ng RNA) of hCNT1, hCNT2, and hCNT3in vitro transcripts. Three identical series of blots were incubated either with hCNT3 probe or with equivalent probes for hCNT1 or hCNT2. The hCNT3 probe, which was 63 and 58% identical in nucleotide sequence to the corresponding regions of hCNT1 and hCNT2, respectively, showed no cross-hybridization with hCNT1 or hCNT2 transcripts. Similarly, there was no cross-reactivity between the hCNT1 and hCNT2 probes and hCNT3 RNA. Some cross-hybridization was seen between the hCNT1 and hCNT2 probes (73% nucleotide sequence identity) and their respective transcripts at RNA loadings ≥50 ng. Under the conditions of high stringency used in our experiments, the hCNT3 probe was therefore specific. In TaqManTMquantitative RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems), an oligonucleotide probe, labeled with a fluorescent tag at the 5′-end and a quenching molecule at the 3′-end, is located between two PCR primers.

In this work, we identify a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of the GABA-producing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) that is required for normal oxidative stress tolerance. A high copy number plasmid bearing the glutamate decarboxylase gene (GAD1) increases resistance to two different oxidants, H2O2 and diamide, in cells that contain an intact glutamate catabolic pathway. Structural similarity of the S. cerevisiae GAD to previously studied plant enzymes was demonstrated by the cross-reaction of the yeast enzyme to a antiserum directed against the plant GAD. The yeast GAD also bound to calmodulin as did the plant enzyme, suggesting a conservation of calcium regulation of this protein. Loss of either gene encoding the downstream steps in the conversion of glutamate to succinate reduced oxidative stress tolerance in normal cells and was epistatic to high copy number GAD1. The gene encoding succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (UGA5) was identified and found to be induced by H2O2 exposure.

Biosynthesis and secretion of GABA is a critical step in assuring normal neural function, and defects in metabolism of this glutamate derivative have been linked with clinical manifestations including epilepsy and Parkinson's disease (3Sherwin A.L. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nisbet A.P. Eve D.J. Kingsbury A.E. Daniel S.E. Marsden C.D. Lees A.J. Foster O.J. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 389-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Regulation of GABA levels is a consequence of the balance between GABA synthesis, catalyzed by GAD, and GABA degradation, catalyzed by the concerted action of the enzymes GABA transaminase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) (reviewed in Ref. 5Shelp B.J. Bown A.w. McLean M.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 446-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Human genetic diseases have been linked to loss of each enzyme in this pathway, underscoring its importance in normal physiology (6Jakobs C. Jaeken J. Gibson K.M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 704-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The specific mechanisms that regulate the activity of these GABA metabolic enzymes are not well described except for plant GAD (7Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This GAD enzyme has been found to bind the Ca2+ regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM), a binding step that acts to elevate the specific activity of the plant GAD (8Snedden W.A. Koutsia N. Baum G. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4148-4158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), perhaps by inducing dimerization (9Yuan T. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30328-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This tight regulation is important in plants, as loss of CaM-regulated GAD activity elicits developmental abnormalities in plants (10Baum G. Lev-Yadun S. Fridmann Y. Arazi T. Katsnelson H. Zik M. Fromm H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2988-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Although the role of GAD-produced GABA as an intercellular signal is well established, relatively little is known of the intracellular function of this glutamate metabolite. In this work, we present initial characterization of the GAD/GABA metabolic pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The use of GABA as a nitrogen source in S. cerevisiae has been well studied, especially with regards to the transcriptional control of the GABA transaminase and GABA transporter loci (11Vissers S. Andre B. Muyldermans F. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Cunningham T.S. Dorrington R.A. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4718-4725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Talibi D. Grenson M. Andre B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). UGA1 encodes the GABA transaminase (14Andre B. Jauniaux J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas UGA4 produces the GABA transporter (15Andre B. Hein C. Grenson M. Jauniaux J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence argues that UGA2 may encode the enzyme SSADH (16Ramos G. el Guezzar M. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but definitive data are lacking to substantiate this suggestion.Here we provide evidence that the YMR250w locus is the gene that encodes the S. cerevisiae glutamate decarboxylase. Data are also presented that YBR006w encodes the SSADH enzyme in this organism. Importantly, we find that the S. cerevisiae l-glutamate metabolism pathway is involved in oxidant tolerance. These experiments provide important evidence that, in addition to the roles of GABA as a neurotransmitter and endocrine regulator, glutamate/GABA metabolism is a key contributor to the ability of cells to tolerate oxidative insult.DISCUSSIONThe participation of glutamate decarboxylase proteins in intercellular signaling pathways has received a great deal of attention due to the important role of GABA in neurotransmission (1Mody I. De Koninck Y. Otis T.S. Soltesz I. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) and in plant development (10Baum G. Lev-Yadun S. Fridmann Y. Arazi T. Katsnelson H. Zik M. Fromm H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2988-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Our work provides insight into the intracellular involvement of GAD in oxidative stress tolerance. Increasing the gene dosage of the S. cerevisiae GAD1 locus produced an increased tolerance to two different oxidative agents, diamide and H2O2. This increased tolerance was strictly dependent on the presence of the intact glutamate catabolic pathway leading to the production of succinate from glutamate. Genetic elimination of either enzymatic reaction downstream from glutamate decarboxylase rendered cells hypersensitive to oxidants. Genetic diseases have been described in humans that are associated with loss of either GABA transaminase or SSADH enzymes, further underscoring the importance of maintenance of the intact glutamate catabolic pathway (6Jakobs C. Jaeken J. Gibson K.M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 704-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).The identification of GAD1 as encoding S. cerevisiae glutamate decarboxylase was made on three independent criteria. First, the highest degree of sequence similarity was found between Gad1p and GAD proteins. Second, an antiserum directed against a plant GAD enzyme cross-reacted with bacterially expressed Gad1p. Finally, an increase in the gene dosage of GAD1 elicited an increase of the expression of a gene known to be responsive to GABA levels (UGA4). Another interesting biochemical similarity between the plant and yeast enzymes was the observation that Gad1p was able to bind to calmodulin like several plant GAD enzymes (7Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Snedden W.A. Koutsia N. Baum G. Fromm H. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,38Ling V. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1135-1143PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gallego P.P.

Biol. 1998; 37: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that perhaps S. cerevisiaeGAD activity will be controlled by calcium/calmodulin as are these plant enzymes and may provide an explanation for the failure to detect enzyme activity of the yeast enzyme in vitro. These experiments suggest that, although Gad1p can bind to the mammalian calmodulin protein, perhaps proper regulation of the yeast enzyme requires the authentic S. cerevisiae calmodulin, a possibility currently under investigation.Evidence is also provided that the S. cerevisiae succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase is encoded by the YBR006w locus that we propose be designated UGA5. As mentioned above, earlier work defined a mutation called uga2 that eliminated SSDH activity, but the locus defined by this mutation was not described (16Ramos G. el Guezzar M. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis will be required to determine whether YBR006w and uga2 are allelic. Several independent pieces of evidence support identification of UGA5 as the SSDH locus in S. cerevisiae. UGA5 shares the highest degree of sequence similarity with SSDH enzymes from other organisms of any ORF in the genome, it is required for utilization of GABA as a nitrogen source and it is highly inducible when GABA is present in the medium.SSADH is also a key participant in the ability of elevated Gad1p levels to influence oxidative stress tolerance. Since loss of either UGA1 or UGA5 is epistatic to amplification of the GAD1 locus, we argue that the entire glutamate catabolic pathway is required for the observed increase in oxidant resistance conferred by high copy number GAD1 plasmids. SSADH enzymes produce either NADH or NADPH during their oxidation of succinate semialdehyde to succinate (41Busch K.B. Hromm H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This production of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide can then be coupled to buffering redox changes that would otherwise occur in the presence of oxidants like H2O2 or diamide.The precise nature of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is not known in the case of S. cerevisiae SSADH. Measurements of the enzymatic properties of the yeast SSADH found that this protein had a 2.5-fold higher activity when assayed in the presence of NAD+ rather than NADP+ (16Ramos G. el Guezzar M. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since the [NADPH+NADP+]/[NADH+NAD+] ratio is 35 in yeast (42Anderlund M. Nissen T.L. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Rydstrom J. Hahn-Hagerdal B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seems more likely that NADP+ will serve as the cofactor for the SSADH reaction in this organism. NADPH is critical for maintenance of normal redox balance and is required for regeneration of reduced glutathione and thioredoxin by glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase, respectively (43Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that activity of the pentose phosphate pathway, which also leads to production of NADPH, is critical for normal oxidative stress tolerance (33Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Juhnke H. Krems B. Kotter P. Entian K.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ensuring proper levels of key antioxidants like glutathione and NADPH is crucial for maintenance of normal oxidative stress resistance (33Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Juhnke H. Krems B. Kotter P. Entian K.-D. Mol. Gen.

The data described here indicate that activity of the glutamate catabolic pathway is also an essential contributor to the intracellular pool of antioxidants.The plant and human SSADH enzymes carry out their catalysis in the mitochondrion (41Busch K.B. Hromm H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 45Hearl W.G. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11459-11463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We believe this is unlikely to be the case for the S. cerevisiae protein. As expected for a protein targeted to the mitochondrion, both the plant and human SSADH proteins possess N-terminal targeting sequences (41Busch K.B. Hromm H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 45Hearl W.G. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11459-11463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the alignment of yeast, bacterial, human, and plant enzymes indicates that the yeast protein does not exhibit an N-terminal targeting extension and instead shows strong sequence similarity with the bacterial enzymes. These data suggest that the S. cerevisiae protein will be found in an extra-mitochondrial location. Localization of the yeast proteins is the focus of future work. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)1 is a metabolite of glutamate that is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in animals (see Ref. 1Mody I. De Koninck Y. Otis T.S. Soltesz I. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar for a review).

This finding suggests that perhaps S. cerevisiaeGAD activity will be controlled by calcium/calmodulin as are these plant enzymes and may provide an explanation for the failure to detect enzyme activity of the yeast enzyme in vitro. These experiments suggest that, although Gad1p can bind to the mammalian calmodulin protein, perhaps proper regulation of the yeast enzyme requires the authentic S. cerevisiae calmodulin, a possibility currently under investigation. Evidence is also provided that the S. cerevisiae succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase is encoded by the YBR006w locus that we propose be designated UGA5. As mentioned above, earlier work defined a mutation called uga2 that eliminated SSDH activity, but the locus defined by this mutation was not described (16Ramos G. el Guezzar M. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis will be required to determine whether YBR006w and uga2 are allelic. Several independent pieces of evidence support identification of UGA5 as the SSDH locus in S. cerevisiae. UGA5 shares the highest degree of sequence similarity with SSDH enzymes from other organisms of any ORF in the genome, it is required for utilization of GABA as a nitrogen source and it is highly inducible when GABA is present in the medium. SSADH is also a key participant in the ability of elevated Gad1p levels to influence oxidative stress tolerance. Since loss of either UGA1 or UGA5 is epistatic to amplification of the GAD1 locus, we argue that the entire glutamate catabolic pathway is required for the observed increase in oxidant resistance conferred by high copy number GAD1 plasmids. SSADH enzymes produce either NADH or NADPH during their oxidation of succinate semialdehyde to succinate (41Busch K.B. Hromm H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This production of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide can then be coupled to buffering redox changes that would otherwise occur in the presence of oxidants like H2O2 or diamide. The precise nature of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is not known in the case of S. cerevisiae SSADH. Measurements of the enzymatic properties of the yeast SSADH found that this protein had a 2.5-fold higher activity when assayed in the presence of NAD+ rather than NADP+ (16Ramos G. el Guezzar M. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since the [NADPH+NADP+]/[NADH+NAD+] ratio is 35 in yeast (42Anderlund M. Nissen T.L. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Rydstrom J. Hahn-Hagerdal B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seems more likely that NADP+ will serve as the cofactor for the SSADH reaction in this organism. NADPH is critical for maintenance of normal redox balance and is required for regeneration of reduced glutathione and thioredoxin by glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase, respectively (43Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that activity of the pentose phosphate pathway, which also leads to production of NADPH, is critical for normal oxidative stress tolerance (33Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Juhnke H. Krems B. Kotter P. Entian K.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ensuring proper levels of key antioxidants like glutathione and NADPH is crucial for maintenance of normal oxidative stress resistance (33Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Juhnke H. Krems B. Kotter P. Entian K.-D. Mol. Gen.

The data described here indicate that activity of the glutamate catabolic pathway is also an essential contributor to the intracellular pool of antioxidants. The plant and human SSADH enzymes carry out their catalysis in the mitochondrion (41Busch K.B. Hromm H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 45Hearl W.G. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11459-11463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We believe this is unlikely to be the case for the S. cerevisiae protein. As expected for a protein targeted to the mitochondrion, both the plant and human SSADH proteins possess N-terminal targeting sequences (41Busch K.B. Hromm H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 45Hearl W.G. Churchich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11459-11463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the alignment of yeast, bacterial, human, and plant enzymes indicates that the yeast protein does not exhibit an N-terminal targeting extension and instead shows strong sequence similarity with the bacterial enzymes. These data suggest that the S. cerevisiae protein will be found in an extra-mitochondrial location. Localization of the yeast proteins is the focus of future work.

Nitric oxide (NO) induces HO-1 in many cell types, but the specific contribution of transcriptional or post-transcriptional effects to this induction have remained unresolved. Here we show that the extent of HO-1 mRNA expression in IMR-90 and HeLa cells depends on the rate of NO delivery, and that the induction occurs more slowly in HeLa than in human fibroblast (IMR-90) cells. We used a specific NO scavenger (2-(4-carboxylphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazolin-1-oxyl 3-oxide) that completely prevented the inducible expression of HO-1 by NO, pointing to direct signaling action of NO in this induction. By inhibiting transcription during the NO exposure, we have confirmed that NO treatment activates a mechanism that stabilizes HO-1 mRNA. The increase in the HO-1 mRNA half-life in IMR-90 cells was directly correlated with increasing rates of NO release. We also show here that the stabilization of the HO-1 message does not require de novo protein synthesis. Collectively, these results show that stabilization of HO-1 mRNA can be finely tuned to the NO exposure, and that the effect in human fibroblasts is mediated by a pre-existing protein.

Many other agents or conditions related to oxidant damage such as longer wavelength UV radiation, hyperoxia, hypoxia, hydrogen peroxide, glutathione depletion, endotoxin, and, more recently, nitric oxide (NO) have also been found to stimulate HO-1 expression (5Keyse S.M.

In recent years, several groups have investigated the functional significance of HO-1 induction, usually by observing the ability of cells to resist different stress insults when HO-1 is under- or overexpressed. These studies have supported the designation of an important cellular defense role for HO-1 against oxidant injury (13Vile G.F. Basu-Modak S. Waltner C. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 13: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, the protective mechanism by which HO-1 acts in different situations is not always clear. One key effect may be the ability of HO-1 to degrade the potentially dangerous intracellular pro-oxidant heme (21Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, HO-1 activity also generates bilirubin as a by-product that can act as a potent peroxyl radical scavenger (22Stocker R. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5918-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar,23Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2873) Google Scholar). An indirect effect of HO-1 activity could be the induction of ferritin by the iron released by heme degradation; more effective sequestration by ferritin would limit free iron from participation in the Fenton reaction (24Eisenstein R.S. Garcia-Mayol D. Pettingell W. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 25Vile G.F. Tyrrell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14678-14681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect effects could also arise from HO-1-generated CO changing gene expression (26Thom S.R. Fisher D. Xu Y.A. Notarfrancesco K. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M.

A recent study demonstrated the importance of CO in providing protection against hyperoxic lung injury (28Otterbein L.E. Mantell L.L. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L688-L694PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of cells to modulate HO-1 expression must certainly contribute to the effectiveness of HO-1 in antioxidant defense. The mechanism of HO-1 induction is therefore of great interest. Most known HO-1 inducers (heme, cadmium, UVA irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, sodium arsenite) seem to increase of the rate of transcription of the HO-1 gene (29Srivastava K.K. Cable E.E. Donohue S.E. Bonkovsky H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Takeda K. Ishizawa S. Sato M. Yoshida T. Shibahara S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1990; 10: 4967-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, some contribution of changes in HO-1 mRNA stability have been seen with nitric oxide (32Hartsfield C.L. Alam J. Cook J.L. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L980-L988PubMed Google Scholar, 33Marquis J.C. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3435-3440PubMed Google Scholar). NO, which plays roles in cellular signaling and in cytotoxicity, induces HO-1 expression in various cell types by a cGMP-independent pathway (10Kim Y.M. Bergonia H.A. Muller C. Pitt B.R. Watkins W.D.

Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms have been implicated in this induction. One study using sodium nitroprusside, an NO donor, concluded that the induction was principally at the transcriptional level, since no change in the stability of HO-1 mRNA was observed (38Takahashi K. Hara E. Ogawa K. Kimura D. Fujita H. Shibahara S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was drawn by Durante et al. (39Durante W. Kroll M.H. Christodoulides N. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), who showed that different classes of NO donors increased HO-1 gene transcription 3–6-fold in vascular smooth muscle cells without a significant change in the half-life of HO-1 mRNA. On the other hand, contribution of both transcription and increased mRNA stability were found for vascular smooth muscle cells treated with an NO-donor compound (32Hartsfield C.L. Alam J. Cook J.L. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L980-L988PubMed Google Scholar) and for human fibroblasts treated with pure NO gas (33Marquis J.C. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3435-3440PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, changes in HO-1 mRNA stability may contribute to induction of the activity, but the exact mechanism can vary with the cell type and the NO exposure conditions. In this study, we elucidate further the role of mRNA stabilization in the induction of HO-1 by nitric oxide. We have used different NO donors to demonstrate a direct correlation between the NO flux rate and HO-1 mRNA stability in human fibroblasts, and we have determined whether changes in mRNA stability depend on de novo protein synthesis. DETA NONOate (DETA/NO), spermine NONOate (SPER/NO), and 2-(4-carboxylphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazolin-1-oxyl 3-oxide (carboxy-PTIO) were purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). Cycloheximide, puromycin, actinomycin D (AD), and 5,6-dichloro-1β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) were from Sigma. Primary human fibroblasts isolated from embryonic lung, IMR-90 cells, and the HeLa human cervical cancer cell line were generously provided by Dr. Robert Schlegel. These cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere. All experiments were performed with confluent culture cells. Conditioned medium (CM) was generated by seeding T-162 tissue culture flasks with IMR-90 cells at one-fourth density and growing them to confluence over 3 days. CM was then collected and stored at 4 °C until use. Cells were exposed to NONOates with the concentrations and times indicated in the results. To determine the mRNA stability of HO-1 in NO-treated or untreated cells, the inhibitor of transcription AD was added to the cell culture medium at the final concentration of 10 μg/ml after the NO treatment. Total RNA was extracted after the times indicated in individual figures. Results obtained with AD were checked with DRB at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. When AD was used to study the effect of de novo RNA synthesis on NO-induced HO-1 mRNA stability, it was added at the same time as SPER/NO. However, because the NO treatment time (1 h) was shorter than the transcription inhibition treatment, the medium was changed after 1 h to remove the NO donor, and replaced by CM containing the appropriate transcription inhibitor for further incubation. To study the requirement of de novo protein synthesis on the HO-1 mRNA turnover, two inhibitors of translation were used: cycloheximide (a translation elongation inhibitor) and puromycin (a translation initiation inhibitor). The inhibitor was added to the medium at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, at time 0 in the presence of AD, and total RNA was extracted at time 0, 2, 4, and 6 h. To study the requirement of translation for the stabilization of HO-1 mRNA in response to NO, puromycin and AD were added at the same time as SPER/NO. As mentioned before, media were changed after 1 h to remove SPER/NO and replaced by CM containing the appropriate translation and transcription inhibitors. As DETA/NO and SPER/NO can release by-products other than NO, their possible effect on HO-1 mRNA expression were evaluated by “reverse-order addition” (ROA) experiments. ROA consisted of adding the NO donor to CM to allow it to decompose for 144 h for 1 mm DETA/NO or 48 h for 0.5 mm SPER/NO. Cells were then incubated with these decomposed NO donors as indicated under “Results.” Cells were exposed to either DETA/NO or SPER/NO at concentrations and times indicated, and the rate of NO release was measured in the culture medium by following the disappearance of the DETA/NO and SPER/NO at 251 and 250 nm, respectively. These NONOate compounds (X[N(O)NO]−), which emerge from the precise mixture of a nucleophile molecule (X−) and NO, spontaneously release 2 mol of NO/mol of dissociating ion (41Keefer L.K. Chemtech. 1998; 28: 30-35Google Scholar). In our experiments, these molecules were quantified spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients εDETA/NO = 7,680 m−1cm−1 and εSPER/NO = 8,000m−1cm−1. IMR-90 or HeLa cells were grown in T-25 tissue culture flasks and exposed to NO and other products as described above. After the incubation time indicated under “Results,” total RNA was extracted from the cells using a commercially available kit (RNeasy; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. For each sample, 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed at 65 mV for 2–3 h in a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane, and probed with the 1-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the human HO-1 cDNA (provided by Dr. Rex Tyrrell, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom; see also Ref. 5Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), which was labeled by the random hexamer priming method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After stripping, the blots were then re-probed with a 1.3-kilobasePstI fragment of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA as a loading control. After two washes at room temperature with 2× standard saline phosphate/EDTA (0.15m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), 0.1% SDS for 15 min and a last washing at 60 °C with 0.1× standard saline phosphate/EDTA (0.15 mNaCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), 0.1% SDS for 30 min, the blots were autoradiographed and the intensity of the hybridization signals was quantified with an Instant Imager analyzer (Packard). Cellular toxicity was determined by measuring the release of LDH activity into the culture medium (kit LD-L 10, Sigma Diagnostics). The percentage of LDH released was defined as the ratio of LDH activity in the supernatant to the sum of LDH activities found in the supernatant and in an extract of the cell pellet. Different structural families of NO donors have been used to examine the biological function of this gaseous molecule. In this study, members of the diazeniumdiolate family (called NONOates) were used as sources of bioactive NO because of their predictable and various rates of NO release at physiological pH (41Keefer L.K. Chemtech. 1998; 28: 30-35Google Scholar). In fact, under our experimental conditions (37 °C in DMEM, 5% CO2 atmosphere), DETA/NO had a half-life of 15 h (data not shown) and therefore slowly generated NO in the culture medium. IMR-90 fibroblasts and HeLa cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of DETA/NO for 8 h to provide rates of NO release ranging from 1 to 30 nm/s (Fig.1 B). HO-1 mRNA expression was then observed by Northern blotting (Fig. 1 A). IMR-90 cells expressed a significant basal level of HO-1 mRNA, while HeLa cells did not contain sufficient HO-1 mRNA to detect by Northern blotting in our hands. However, the level of HO-1 mRNA was increased in both cell types after exposure to DETA/NO. Induced HO-1 mRNA was apparent in HeLa cells exposed to 12.5 nm NO/s and in IMR-90 cells exposed to NO at 5 nm NO/s (Fig. 1,A and B). The increased expression of HO-1 mRNA, normalized to GAPDH, was directly correlated in both cell types with the rate of NO release (Fig. 1, B andC). The maximal induction in this experiment was seen with 1 mm DETA/NO, which produced NO at 20–30 nm/s in contact with cells (Fig. 1 B). DETA/NO at 1 mm was used to compare the time course of HO-1 mRNA induction in both cell types (Fig.2). Under these conditions, DETA/NO released NO at a linear rate equivalent to 24 nm/s (data not shown; cf. Fig. 1 B). The results showed that induction of HO-1 mRNA in IMR-90 cells may have occurred somewhat more rapidly, and did achieve a higher maximum level than found for HeLa cells (Fig. 2). Indeed, increased HO-1 mRNA was detected in IMR-90 cells as early as 1 h after starting the DETA/NO exposure whereas ∼2 h of exposure was required for HeLa cells (Fig. 2). For both cell types, the maximal HO-1 induction occurred at ∼4 h of exposure (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Time course of HO-1 mRNA induction in HeLa and IMR-90 cells in response to DETA/NO. A, cells were treated for 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h with 1 mmDETA/NO, which released NO linearly at 24 nm/s. Analysis by Northern blotting was as described for Fig. 1. ROA experiments (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) were performed to determine whether the stable decay by-products of DETA/NO affect HO-1 expression.

The experiments were performed twice (HeLa cells) or three times (IMR-90 cells) and a representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because NO donors can generate by-products other than NO, we have also tested whether such by-products could affect HO-1 mRNA expression. When 1 mm DETA/NO was completely decomposed in CM for several days and the cells were exposed to this material for 8 h (ROA experiment described under “Experimental Procedures”), there was no change in the level of HO-1 mRNA (Fig. 2, right panel, far right lane). Thus, at least the stable by-products of DETA/NO decomposition are not responsible for HO-1 mRNA induction. HO-1 mRNA expression was also measured after SPER/NO exposure, which can mimic a burst release of NO. This compound had a half-life of 36 min under our experimental conditions, with 0.5 mmSPER/NO releasing NO at the rate of nearly 120 nm/s (data not shown). HeLa and IMR-90 cells were exposed to SPER/NO for increasing times ranging from 15 to 60 min and analyzed for HO-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 3, HO-1 mRNA expression was not induced in SPER/NO-treated HeLa cells, while it rapidly increased up to 5.5-fold during a 1-h exposure of IMR-90 cells. In an ROA experiment, the effect of 0.5 mmSPER/NO was reduced 8-fold (data not shown), again indicating that stable reaction by-products of NO are not the major inducers of HO-1 mRNA under our conditions. To determine the involvement of NO itself in the induction of HO-1 mRNA expression, we used carboxy-PTIO. Unlike most NO scavengers, which do not discriminate nitric oxide from NO-derived by-products, carboxy-PTIO immediately reacts with NO⋅ to form the NO2· radical, the closest oxygen-dependent product of NO (41Keefer L.K. Chemtech. 1998; 28: 30-35Google Scholar). Thus, by using carboxy-PTIO as a dual-function NO scavenger and NO2· donor, we could test both the requirement for NO· and the possible effect of NO2· and NO2·-derived products, such as N2O4, NO2−, and NO3−, in induction of HO-1 (42Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 43Yoshida K. Akaike T. Doi T. Sato K. Ijiri S. Suga M. Ando M. Maeda H. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IMR-90 cells were treated with DETA/NO (1 mm, 8 h) in the absence or presence of carboxy-PTIO, then analyzed for HO-1 mRNA. Under our experimental conditions, carboxy-PTIO alone or in combination with DETA/NO did not affect the amount of total RNA recovered (data not shown) or the amount of the GAPDH mRNA present (Fig. 4). Further, only a small increase in the release of LDH was observed under these experimental conditions: control, DETA/NO alone, and carboxy-PTIO alone, all ∼4% release,versus carboxy-PTIO and DETA/NO combined, 14% release (data not shown). Although carboxy-PTIO itself had a weak but measurable effect on HO-1 mRNA induction (Fig. 4, lane 2), this compound completely blocked the action of DETA/NO (Fig. 4, compare lane 2 versus lane 4 and lane 1 versus lane 3). We conclude that NO2· and NO2·-derived species are not involved in HO-1 induction in IMR-90 cells, and the data point toward a direct role for NO itself. By using NONOates, three different rates of NO release were tested for their effect on the turnover of HO-1 mRNA in IMR-90 cells. We used 0.25 mm DETA/NO to generate NO at 4 nm NO/s, with exposure for 16 h as a “chronic” exposure. A more intense chronic regime was achieved with 1 mm DETA/NO (releasing NO at 30 nm/s) for 8 h. Finally, we used 0.5 mm SPER/NO to generate NO at 120 nm NO/s for 1 h in order to mimic a burst exposure. To determine the mRNA half-life of HO-1, the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D was added to the culture medium immediately after NO treatment, and the incubation continued. Untreated-IMR-90 cells had a half-life for HO-1 mRNA of 2.3 h (Fig.5 D), similar to that determined previously (33Marquis J.C. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3435-3440PubMed Google Scholar). When the cells were exposed to a chronic exposure of NO at a rate of 4 nm NO/s, the level of HO-1 mRNA was increased and the HO-1 mRNA half-life was not increased significantly (t 12 = 2.6 h; Fig.5 A). Exposure to NO at 30 nm/s for 8 h dramatically increased the mRNA level and increased the stability of HO-1 mRNA to a half-life of 6.1 h (Fig. 5 B). The stability was further increased to 10.5 h in cells exposed to NO at 120 nm/s (Fig. 5 C). The results are summarized in Fig. 5 D, which shows the strong correlation between the rate of NO release and the half-life of HO-1 mRNA. We were unable to determine whether NO exposure stabilizes HO-1 mRNA in HeLa cells, because the addition of AD was toxic after 4 h of treatment (data not shown). In order to explore the contribution of post-transcriptional events in the induction of HO-1 mRNA by NO, we blocked transcription by adding AD at the same time as SPER/NO. This approach allowed us to determine whether transcription is necessary for NO-induced stabilization of the HO-1 message. As shown in Fig.6, the constitutively expressed HO-1 mRNA in IMR-90 cells was rapidly stabilized in response to a burst of NO, and this stability persisted after SPER/NO was removed to give a half-life for the mRNA of 6.3 h. Thus, the mechanism by which NO increases the stability of HO-1 mRNA does not require de novo RNA synthesis. In order to explore the role of translation in NO-mediated stabilization of the HO-1 mRNA, we employed two inhibitors. We found that the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide by itself increased the stability of the HO-1 mRNA quite strongly (Fig. 7 A). Therefore, this agent could not be used to study the role of translation in NO-induced stabilization. However, puromycin, an inhibitor of translation initiation, had little effect on HO-1 mRNA turnover. The half-life of HO-1 mRNA in puromycin-treated cells (2.8 h) was comparable to that in control cells (Fig. 7 B). It thus became feasible to study the possible requirement of de novo protein synthesis during the NO-induced HO-1 mRNA stabilization. We exposed IMR-90 cells simultaneously to 10 μg/ml puromycin and AD, in the presence or absence of SPER/NO, and measured the HO-1 mRNA levels using Northern blotting. Our results (Fig.8) showed that AD-treated cells and AD-puromycin-treated cells presented a similar half-life of the HO-1 mRNA, close to 2 h (Fig. 8, filled circles and filled squares). Most importantly, the HO-1 mRNA stability induced by SPER/NO was still observed when translation was inhibited (Fig. 8, compareopen circles and open squares), with the HO-1 mRNA half-life for both AD-SPER/NO-treated cells and AD-puromycin-SPER/NO-treated cells ∼6 h (Fig. 8). Thus, de novo protein synthesis is not required for NO-induced stabilization of the HO-1 mRNA.Figure 8Effect of the translation inhibitor puromycin on NO-induced HO-1 mRNA stability in IMR-90 cells. Cells were treated with either 10 μg/ml AD alone (AD), in combination with 10 μg/ml puromycin (AD + puromycin), in combination with 0.5 mm SPER/NO (AD + SPER/NO), or with all three agents combined (AD + SPER/NO + puromycin). After 1 h, the medium was changed to remove the NO donor and replaced with medium containing either AD alone or AD + puromycin. The incubation was then continued, and, at the indicated times, total RNA was extracted and analyzed for both HO-1 and GAPDH mRNA expression by Northern blotting. The hybridization signals were quantified and graphed, with the dotted lines showing the estimated half-life values. The experiments were performed twice with similar results; the results of one experiment are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the effect of nitric oxide on HO-1 gene expression, various NO-releasing compounds (40Takahashi K. Hara E. Suzuki H. Sasano H. Shibahara S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as pure NO gas (33Marquis J.C. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3435-3440PubMed Google Scholar) have been used. In the present study, we used two diazeniumdiolates as NO donors because of their controlled and predictable ability to release NO under physiological conditions (44Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to demonstrate a direct correlation between the rate of NO release in the range 1–30 nm/s and the induction of HO-1 mRNA in IMR-90 cells. However, Takahashi et al. (38Takahashi K. Hara E. Ogawa K. Kimura D. Fujita H. Shibahara S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), using three different classes of NO donors, found a poor correlation between the formation of nitrite (as a measure of NO release) and the HO-1 mRNA level in HeLa cells. They reported that, although sodium nitroprusside released the lowest amount of nitrite (∼10 μm) compared with the compounds S-nitroso-glutathione (∼ 15 μm) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (∼ 40 μm), sodium nitroprusside was the most efficient inducer of HO-1 mRNA (38Takahashi K. Hara E. Ogawa K. Kimura D. Fujita H. Shibahara S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). They obtained similar results in a second study (37Hara E. Takahashi K. Takeda K. Nakayama M. Yoshizawa M. Fujita H. Shirato K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This absence of correlation between the production of nitrite and the induction of HO-1 expression illustrates some problems with use of NO donors, and might be explained as follows. Sodium nitroprusside releases cyanide and iron that may act in additional ways to induce HO-1 mRNA, thus exaggerating the actual NO effect. On the other hand, as 3-morpholinosydnonimine releases NO and superoxide anion simultaneously, the weak effect of 3-morpholinosydnonimine on induction of HO-1 mRNA expression may be due to peroxynitrite formation instead of direct NO production; that would also account for the elevated nitrite release by 3-morpholinosydnonimine. The result from that group may thus be consistent with the data we present here, which point to a role for NO rather than oxygen-dependent NO by-products in HO-1 induction. Under aerobic conditions, the rapid decomposition of NO can follow different pathways. By interacting with oxygen, NO can successively form the radical NO2·, N2O3/N2O4, and then a mixture of nitrite and nitrate. We tested the effect of most of these NO by-products on the induction of HO-1 mRNA by using carboxy-PTIO, which both scavenges NO⋅ and generates NO2· and its derived species (N2O4, NO2−, and NO3−) (43Yoshida K. Akaike T. Doi T. Sato K. Ijiri S. Suga M. Ando M. Maeda H. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3552-3555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that NO2· and its related products are not involved in the induction. Although the data are thus consistent with a key signaling role for NO, products such as N2O3 and nitrosothiols cannot be ruled out. In IMR-90 cells, HO-1 mRNA has a relatively rapid turnover, with a half-life of ∼2 h. We tested whether active translation was required for HO-1 degradation by using cycloheximide and puromycin, two translation inhibitors with different mechanisms of action. Unexpectedly, HO-1 mRNA was strongly stabilized in cycloheximide-treated cells (half-life >8 h; Fig. 7 A). This result could suggest the involvement of the HO-1 nascent peptide in mRNA degradation, as has been reported for the N-terminal Met-Arg-Glu-Ile motif of β-tubulin mRNA in its turnover (45Yen T.J. Machlin P.S. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, the HO-1 N terminus (Met-Glu-Arg-Pro) differs significantly from that of β-tubulin. It was also possible that a labile protein interacts with a cis-regulatory element in the HO-1 mRNA to destabilize it. However, the translation inhibitor puromycin did not significantly stabilize HO-1 mRNA; thus the rapid turnover of HO-1 mRNA does not seem to involve active translation. Since cycloheximide is an inhibitor of translation elongation, it may permit polysome aggregation to stabilize the HO-1 message; in contrast, puromycin dissociates polysomes by causing abortive termination (46Pestka S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1971; 25: 487-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the stabilization of the HO-1 message that is mediated by NO⋅ does not require translation, as it still occurs in puromycin-treated cells. The previous result (33Marquis J.C. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3435-3440PubMed Google Scholar) showing stabilization of HO-1 mRNA by pure NO gas led us to study the effects of more physiological doses and long term NO exposure. This approach also avoided the hypoxia that might accompany prolonged (>2 h) exposures to NO gas (33Marquis J.C. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3435-3440PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia also induces HO-1 mRNA expression (7Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Short S.M. Sutherland R.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). By using the slow NO-releasing compound DETA/NO and the fast NO-releasing compound SPER/NO, we found a gradual increase in the HO-1 mRNA half-life up to 10.5 h correlated with an increasing rate of NO release up to 120 nm/s. Moreover, the change in message stability occurs immediately upon NO exposure and in the absence of active transcription (Fig. 6). These observations suggest that cells are able to sense and respond directly to various levels of NO by adjusting the stability of HO-1 mRNA. Fine-tuning mRNA stability for HO-1 and perhaps for other transcripts may constitute an important cellular response to NO toxicity. NO-inducible stabilization of the HO-1 message is transient, however, and disappears relatively quickly after the NO exposure ceases (33Marquis J.C. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3435-3440PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of others to detect this effect (32Hartsfield C.L. Alam J. Cook J.L. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L980-L988PubMed Google Scholar, 38Takahashi K. Hara E. Ogawa K. Kimura D. Fujita H. Shibahara S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) may be a result of taking time points too late or using NO levels too low. The modulation of HO-1 mRNA stability described here is a rapid process independent of RNA or protein synthesis. Thus, a stable protein already present in the cell may modulate HO-1 mRNA turnover in response to NO. One candidate is the iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1), which regulates iron metabolism at a post-transcriptional level in mammalian cells (47Bouton C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Once activated by NO, IRP-1 recognizes specific sequences called iron-response elements (IREs) on several mRNAs (e.g. those encoding ferritin, and the transferrin receptor). In the case of transferrin receptor mRNA, IRE/IRP-1 interaction in the 3′ end of the message confers stability against endonucleolytic cleavage (48Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M.

However, we have not detected IRP-1 binding to any region of HO-1 mRNA in either control or NO-treated IMR-90 cells (data not shown). Further efforts are directed at identifying the relevant control regions of the HO-1 mRNA and the NO-regulated proteins that interact with them.

https://openalex.org/W2144859756,"An alternative spliced form of the presinilin 2 (PS2) gene (PS2V) lacking exon 5 has previously been reported to be expressed in human brains in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). PS2V encodes the amino-terminal portion of PS2, which contains residues Met1-Leu119 and 5 additional amino acid residues (SSMAG) at its carboxyl terminus. Here we report that PS2V protein impaired the signaling pathway of the unfolded protein response, similarly to familial AD-linked PS1 mutants and caused significant increases in the production of both amyloid β40 and β42. Interestingly, PS2V-encoding protein was expressed in neuropathologically affected neurons of the hippocampal CA1 region and temporal cortex in AD patients. These findings suggest that the aberrant splicing of the PS2 gene may be implicated in the neuropathology of sporadic AD."

In the present study, we investigated the role of the proteasome for ligand-dependent endocytosis and degradation of the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) complex. Proteasome inhibitors impaired internalization of IL-2·IL-2R and prevented the lysosomal degradation of this cytokine. Based on time-course studies, proteasome activity is primarily required after initial endocytosis of the IL-2·IL-2R. Proteasome function was also necessary for the lysosomal degradation of IL-2 internalized by IL-2R that were comprised of cytoplasmic tailless β- or γc-subunits, suggesting that the target protein for the proteasome is independent of either the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-2R β- or γc-subunits and their associated signaling components. Therefore, a functional proteasome is required for optimal endocytosis of the IL-2R/ligand complex and is essential for the subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2, possibly by regulating trafficking to the lysosome.

Malek T.R. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 503-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2 promotes oligomerization of these subunits and activation of a number of receptor-associated signaling molecules, including Janus kinase (Jak)-1/3, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5/3, p56lck, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase that is recruited by the Shc-adapter protein (2Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another immediate consequence of IL-2·IL-2R interaction is ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex. In T lymphocytes, 50% of the receptor-ligand complex is internalized within 10–15 min (3Duprez V. Ferrer M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18639-18643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Weissman A. Harford J. Svetlik P. Leonard W. Depper J. Waldmann T. Greene W. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1463-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced endocytosis of the IL-2R is primarily dependent upon the cytoplasmic tail of γc (5Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 2556-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Studies that have followed the fate of these proteins indicate that IL-2Rα recycles to the plasma membrane from an early endosomal compartment, whereas the β- and γc-subunits as well as IL-2 traffic to the lysosome, where they are degraded (7Hemar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Within the immune system, the proteasome is essential for production of peptides for MHC class I antigen presentation. The proteasome also has a well described role in the degradation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins, including the elimination of misfolded proteins as well as controlling the levels of certain transcription factors or cell cycle regulatory proteins (8Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Most proteins destined for degradation are targeted to the proteasome by ubiquitination (9Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). More recent studies have implicated ubiquitination in the internalization of a growing list of cells surface receptors (10Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 11Strous G.J. Govers R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for the proteasome in regulating the levels of cell surface receptors. In the present study we have used specific inhibitors to explore the potential role of the proteasome for endocytosis and degradation of the IL-2·IL-2R complex.DISCUSSIONThe proteasome is not typically considered as a key regulator of ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this study we show a mandatory role for the proteasome for normal endocytosis of IL-2·IL-2R and subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2. Blockade of the 26 S proteasome did not affect the initial endocytosis of IL-2, but was necessary for sustained endocytosis and was essential for lysosomal degradation of IL-2. These findings add to increasing evidence that rapid ligand-induced internalization of cell surface IL-2·IL-2R complexes occurs by a novel endocytic mechanism. For example, although IL-2R and transferrin receptors are both detected in early endosomes, blockade of coated-pit internalization of the transferrin receptor had minimal effect on the internalization of IL-2·IL-2R (21Subtil A. Hemar A. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these molecules may utilize distinct pathways to traffic to the early endosome. Furthermore, recently a critical endocytic signal has been identified within a 9-amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of γc (6Yu A. Olosz F. Choi C. Malek T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2556-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and this region lacks tyrosine or dileucine motifs that target receptor-ligand complexes to clathrin-coated pits, which are typically necessary for entry into the early endosome compartment.It was possible to delay addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to a point (30 min) where substantial endocytosis of IL-2·IL-2R occurred and still potently inhibit lysosomal degradation of IL-2. This finding raises the possibility that proteasome function may be solely required for trafficking internalized IL-2 from an endosomal compartment to the lysosome. In this scenario the capacity of proteasome inhibitors to impair internalization of IL-2·IL-2R may be secondary to this regulatory role in trafficking. We cannot, however, rule out a broader role for proteasome function for endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex.The molecular target for proteasome action in IL-2·IL-2R endocytosis has not been established. Generally, polyubiquitination of intracellular proteins targets them for recognition and proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. As a number a studies have demonstrated ubiquitination of cell surface receptors (10Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility the cytoplasmic tail of IL-2R β- or γc-subunits might be critical targets for the proteasome. Importantly, proteasome function was still required for lysosomal degradation of IL-2 after internalization by IL-2R that contained cytoplasmic tailless β- or γc-subunits. So far, we have also been unsuccessful in directly demonstrating that these subunits are modified by ubiquitin (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic portion of the IL-2R or their associated signaling components are unlikely to be targets for the proteasome. Consistent with this notion, we showed distinct kinetic requirements for proteasome function for IL-2-mediated endocytosis and IL-2-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation.A number of cell surface receptors are ubiquitinated upon ligand activation. In mammalian cells, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (22Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 83: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were among the first receptors shown to undergo ligand-induced ubiquitination of their cytoplasmic tails. In these cases, the lysosome appears to be the primary target for degradation of these receptors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the G-protein coupled α-factor receptor undergoes enhanced mono- or short chain ubiquitination upon binding α-factor, which facilitates endocytosis and subsequent degradation by the lysosome (27Roth A.F.

The use of yeast defective in ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes established a role for this protein modification in endocytosis (27Roth A.F. Sullivan D.M. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). So far, there has been little direct evidence that proteasome function is involved in this process, and it has been suggested that ubiquitination may serve as a targeting sequence for entry into the endocytic pathway leading to down-regulation of the cell surface receptor (10Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). One exception appears to be endocytosis of the growth hormone receptor. Similar to our results on the IL-2R, proteasome activity appears to be required for ligand-induced endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of growth hormone receptor that is independent of ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of growth hormone receptor (29van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dos Santos C.M. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The fate of the receptor-associated ligand was not determined in that study. Proteasome inhibitors have also been reported to affect the levels of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (22Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the Met kinase receptor (30Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Van de Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but these effects have not been ascribed to regulation of the endocytic pathway. If our findings on the IL-2R are generalized, perhaps the role for proteasome function in regulating these cell surface receptors is to gain entry into a cellular compartment for lysosomal/vacuolar degradation that is independent of ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. The high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R)1 is comprised of three subunits; an α-chain, which functions solely in IL-2 binding, and β- and common γ (γc)-chains that function in both ligand binding and signal transduction (1He Y.-W. Malek T.R. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 503-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2 promotes oligomerization of these subunits and activation of a number of receptor-associated signaling molecules, including Janus kinase (Jak)-1/3, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5/3, p56lck, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase that is recruited by the Shc-adapter protein (2Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another immediate consequence of IL-2·IL-2R interaction is ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex. In T lymphocytes, 50% of the receptor-ligand complex is internalized within 10–15 min (3Duprez V. Ferrer M. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18639-18643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Weissman A. Harford J. Svetlik P. Leonard W. Depper J. Waldmann T. Greene W. Klausner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1463-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced endocytosis of the IL-2R is primarily dependent upon the cytoplasmic tail of γc (5Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S., N., T. Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 6Yu A. Olosz F. Choi C. Malek T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2556-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Studies that have followed the fate of these proteins indicate that IL-2Rα recycles to the plasma membrane from an early endosomal compartment, whereas the β- and γc-subunits as well as IL-2 traffic to the lysosome, where they are degraded (7Hemar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Within the immune system, the proteasome is essential for production of peptides for MHC class I antigen presentation. The proteasome also has a well described role in the degradation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins, including the elimination of misfolded proteins as well as controlling the levels of certain transcription factors or cell cycle regulatory proteins (8Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Most proteins destined for degradation are targeted to the proteasome by ubiquitination (9Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). More recent studies have implicated ubiquitination in the internalization of a growing list of cells surface receptors (10Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 11Strous G.J. Govers R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role for the proteasome in regulating the levels of cell surface receptors. In the present study we have used specific inhibitors to explore the potential role of the proteasome for endocytosis and degradation of the IL-2·IL-2R complex. DISCUSSIONThe proteasome is not typically considered as a key regulator of ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this study we show a mandatory role for the proteasome for normal endocytosis of IL-2·IL-2R and subsequent lysosomal degradation of IL-2. Blockade of the 26 S proteasome did not affect the initial endocytosis of IL-2, but was necessary for sustained endocytosis and was essential for lysosomal degradation of IL-2. These findings add to increasing evidence that rapid ligand-induced internalization of cell surface IL-2·IL-2R complexes occurs by a novel endocytic mechanism. For example, although IL-2R and transferrin receptors are both detected in early endosomes, blockade of coated-pit internalization of the transferrin receptor had minimal effect on the internalization of IL-2·IL-2R (21Subtil A. Hemar A. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these molecules may utilize distinct pathways to traffic to the early endosome. Furthermore, recently a critical endocytic signal has been identified within a 9-amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of γc (6Yu A. Olosz F. Choi C. Malek T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2556-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and this region lacks tyrosine or dileucine motifs that target receptor-ligand complexes to clathrin-coated pits, which are typically necessary for entry into the early endosome compartment.It was possible to delay addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to a point (30 min) where substantial endocytosis of IL-2·IL-2R occurred and still potently inhibit lysosomal degradation of IL-2. This finding raises the possibility that proteasome function may be solely required for trafficking internalized IL-2 from an endosomal compartment to the lysosome. In this scenario the capacity of proteasome inhibitors to impair internalization of IL-2·IL-2R may be secondary to this regulatory role in trafficking. We cannot, however, rule out a broader role for proteasome function for endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex.The molecular target for proteasome action in IL-2·IL-2R endocytosis has not been established. Generally, polyubiquitination of intracellular proteins targets them for recognition and proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. As a number a studies have demonstrated ubiquitination of cell surface receptors (10Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility the cytoplasmic tail of IL-2R β- or γc-subunits might be critical targets for the proteasome. Importantly, proteasome function was still required for lysosomal degradation of IL-2 after internalization by IL-2R that contained cytoplasmic tailless β- or γc-subunits. So far, we have also been unsuccessful in directly demonstrating that these subunits are modified by ubiquitin (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic portion of the IL-2R or their associated signaling components are unlikely to be targets for the proteasome. Consistent with this notion, we showed distinct kinetic requirements for proteasome function for IL-2-mediated endocytosis and IL-2-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation.A number of cell surface receptors are ubiquitinated upon ligand activation.

In these cases, the lysosome appears to be the primary target for degradation of these receptors. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the G-protein coupled α-factor receptor undergoes enhanced mono- or short chain ubiquitination upon binding α-factor, which facilitates endocytosis and subsequent degradation by the lysosome (27Roth A.F.

The NPC1 compartment was shown to be enriched in glycolipids, and internalization of GalNAcβ1–4[NeuAcα2–3]Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1′-ceramide (GM2) into endocytic vesicles depends on the presence of NPC1 protein. The glycolipid profiles of the NPC1 compartment could be modulated by LDL uptake and accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol. Expression in cells of biologically active NPC1 protein fused to green fluorescent protein revealed rapidly moving and flexible tubular extensions emanating from the NPC1-containing vesicles.

This lysosomal pool of cholesterol remains metabolically inert until it has been delivered to other cellular organelles. The metabolic significance and mechanisms of lysosomal cholesterol trafficking have begun to be revealed through the study of Niemann-Pick C (NP-C)1 disease (1Paterson, M. C., Vanier, M. T., Suzuki, K., Morris, J. A., Carstea, E. D., Neufeld, E. B., Blanchette Mackie, E. J., Pentchev, P. G. (2001) in, Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease, C.R. Scriver, A.L. Beaudet, W.S. Sly, D.D. Vale 8th Ed., Chap. 145, pp. 3611–3634 McGraw-Hill, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The prominent cellular feature of this metabolic disorder is the extensive sequestration and accumulation of LDL cholesterol in lysosomes resulting from a defect in the translocation of this sterol pool to other cellular membranes (2Pentchev P.G.

The recognition of this genetically induced sterol-trafficking defect introduced the concept of specific protein-mediated egress of cholesterol from lysosomes. This notion was further supported by the subsequent recognition of two separate defective gene loci for NP-C disease (5Vanier M.T. Duthel S. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Pentchev P.G. Carstea E.D. Am. J.

Analysis of the primary sequence suggests that the NPC1 protein has several different domains likely to have functional significance. In addition to a signal peptide for endoplasmic reticulum insertion (amino acid residues 1–22), the N terminus of NPC1 contains a region (amino acid residues 55–165) that has been termed the “NPC1 domain” because of its high degree of conservation in a wide array of existing NPC1 orthologs. Downstream of the NPC1 domain are five predicted transmembrane domains (at amino acid residues 615–797) in a region with strong homology to the putative sterol sensing domains of several other proteins, including the sterol response element binding protein cleavage-activating protein, the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, and the Hedgehog signaling protein, Patched. The C terminus of NPC1 contains a dileucine motif suggested to be required for the targeting of proteins to lysosomes. The functional significance of these domains was recently confirmed in studies using site-directed mutagenic mapping strategies (8Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Glick J.M. Patel S.

These findings suggested that general retroendocytic trafficking and mobilization of multiple lysosomal cargo are defective at a late endosomal trafficking step. This concept provided an explanation for the accumulation of multiple lipids in NP-C cells and tissues (1Paterson, M. C., Vanier, M. T., Suzuki, K., Morris, J. A., Carstea, E. D., Neufeld, E.

This report also documents an unusual mode of tubular membrane trafficking for the NPC1 compartment that appears to be linked to the NPC1 protein. Based on these results we discuss the concept of a multiple functional repertoire for the NPC1 compartment that includes the sorting of glycolipids and cholesterol.

Fibroblasts were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin/ml in humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For immunocytochemical analyses, fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 20,000 cells/well in McCoy's/5% LPDS medium in 9.5-cm glass chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) coated with human fibronectin. Cells in glass chamber slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were immunocytochemically labeled using an indirect procedure in which all incubations (quench, primary and secondary antibodies, and washes) were performed in blocking solution containing filipin (0.05%) and IgG (2.5 mg/ml) of the secondary antibody species. Primary antibody solutions were used at the following dilutions; NPC1 (1:1000), LAMP2 (1:50), LBPA (1:50), apoD (1:100), M6PR (1:500), Rab7 (1:100), GM2 (1:50), O1 anti-Gal/Lac-Cer (1:100), CTH (1:50), and GD3 (1:50). Secondary FITC Cy5 and LRSC-labeled antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution. Fluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss 410 laser confocal scanning microscope using an Omnichrome model krypton-argon laser (American Laser Corp., Salt lake City, UT) with excitation wavelengths of 488, 633 and 568 nm, for FITC Cy5 and LRSC, respectively. Filipin fluorescence was viewed using an Enterprise model argon laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. Normal (ENZ143) and NP-C fibroblasts expressing mutated (GM3123) or no detectable (DMNB98.16) NPC1 protein were seeded at a density of 500,000 cells in plastic 100-mm dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine medium, 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin/ml in humidified 95% air and 5%CO2 at 37 °C.

The radioactivity of gangliosides identified using authentic standards was determined by liquid scintillation counting.

The plasmid containing GFP-NPC1 cDNA was sequenced to confirm insertion at the appropriate sites. Another mammalian expression vector, pNES-6, was constructed in multiple steps. Briefly, the fragment encoding NPC1 was obtained by restriction digestion of plasmid 1-1 with Eco RI and was inserted into pSV-SPORT1 (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) at theEco RI site. Directionality of this construct, pSN, was confirmed by restriction digestion. A linker encoding 6 histidine residues and a Bam HI site was inserted at the 3′-end of NPC1 to replace the stop codon of NPC1. Finally, GFP from pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was inserted in-frame into the Bam HI site in the linker in pSN to create the plasmid pNES-6 encoding an NPC1-GFP fusion protein. Functional expression of the plasmids pNNE and pNES-6 was confirmed by complementation of the NP-C phenotype in both CT-60 NP-C mutant CHO cells (20Cruz J.C. Shigeki S. Chunjiang Y. Chang T.Y. J.

Earlier immunocytochemical studies showed that the NPC1 protein is located in a unique set of LAMP2-containing vesicles that do not contain mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) or LDL-derived cholesterol (10Neufeld E.B.

We have now further defined the intracellular distribution of the NPC1 protein in cultured fibroblasts with additional markers of the late endosomal pathway. The data are summarized in TableI and are collected from fibroblasts incubated with LDL for 24 h. As previously reported, NPC1 and cholesterol are located in separate vesicles (Fig.1, A and B), but both are positive for LAMPs 2 and 3 and LIMP (Table I). The NPC1 protein-containing vesicle contains the late endosomal marker Rab7 (Fig. 1, C and D, and Table I). The NPC1 compartment is not enriched in cathepsin D (Fig. 1, E andF), and NPC1 sparsely localizes as well with α and β-hexosaminidase (Table I). However, both cathepsin D and α- and β-hexosaminidase strongly colocalize with cholesterol-enriched LAMP-positive vesicles (Table I). The distribution of markers among the separate NPC1 and cholesterol-enriched vesicles confirms that the NPC1 protein is normally localized in a late endosomal compartment apart from cholesterol-enriched lysosomes. These two separate subsets of LAMP-positive vesicles of the endocytic pathway, NPC1-positive late endosomes and LDL-cholesterol enriched lysosomes, are present in all normal fibroblasts and most NP-C fibroblast cell lines studied. We have, however, found two NPC cell lines in which both NPC1 and LDL-derived cholesterol locate together in the same LAMP-positive vesicle. Although a single gene is affected by the NPC1 mutation, the protein has multiple domains each of which may be affected and produce a different phenotype.Table IComparison of the NPC1 containing vesicles with the cholesterol enriched vesicles: immunocytochemical and endocytic marker characterization of fibroblasts incubated with LDL for 24 hNPC1-containing vesiclesCholesterol-enriched vesiclesImmunocytochemical and endocytic markers of vesicle contentPositivePositiveLAMP2, LAMP3 (lysosomal–associated membrane proteins 2 and 3), and LIMP1 (lysosomal integral membrane protein-1)PositiveNegativeRab7 (GTPase)NegativeNegativeM6PR (mannose-6-phosphate receptor)NegativeNegativeAdaptins 1 and 2NegativePositiveApoD (apolipoprotein D)NegativePositiveLBPA (lysobisphosphatidic acid)Some PositivePositiveCathepsin DSome PositivePositiveα- and β-HexosaminidasePositivePositiveDextranNegativePositiveDiI-LDLGlycolipidsPositiveNegative GM2PositiveNegative Gal-Cer/Lac-CerNegativePositive GD3NegativePositive CTH Open table in a new tab In fibroblasts, LDL-cholesterol-enriched lysosomes contain also apolipoprotein D (Table I) and lysobisphosphatidic acid, a presumptive marker for the late endosomal compartments (12Kobayashi T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, A and B, and Table I), whereas neither is present in the NPC1 compartment. Adaptins 1 and 2 are not present in either the NPC1 vesicle or the cholesterol-enriched vesicle (Table I). Cellular uptake of the fluid phase marker, fluorescent dextran, by fibroblasts (Table I), and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) enriched both the NPC1 vesicle (Fig.1, G and H) and the cholesterol-containing (Fig.2, C and D) compartment. DiI-LDL, an endocytosed marker for lysosomes (22Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), colocalized with cholesterol-enriched vesicles in both fibroblasts (Table I) and CHO cells (Fig. 2,E and F). In cholesterol-depleted normal fibroblasts, NPC1 has a diffuse cellular distribution with little discernible vesicular staining (Fig.3 A). During a subsequent period of cellular cholesterol enrichment with LDL, prominent detection of NPC1 protein in endocytic vesicles is now noted (Fig.3 B). This marked alteration in the cytochemical detection of NPC1 appears to reflect changes in the organization and distribution of the protein, because Western blot comparisons of cell extracts from cholesterol-depleted and -enriched cultures did not show any differences in absolute levels (data not shown). Because the NPC1 protein has transmembrane domains, it is likely the diffuse cellular immunofluorescence under conditions of cholesterol depletion represents NPC1's diffuse distribution in an extensive membranous compartment, perhaps the endoplasmic reticulum. A similar effect of cellular cholesterol enrichment on NPC1 protein distribution was reported in an independent study (23Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C. Marks D. Pagano R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in these cholesterol-enriched cells, the NPC1 protein and cholesterol remain in separate and distinct LAMP-containing vesicles. Glycolipids as well as cholesterol accumulate in NP-C disease (1Paterson, M. C., Vanier, M. T., Suzuki, K., Morris, J. A., Carstea, E. D., Neufeld, E. B., Blanchette Mackie, E. J., Pentchev, P. G. (2001) in, Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease, C.R. Scriver, A.L. Beaudet, W.S. Sly, D.D. Vale 8th Ed., Chap. 145, pp. 3611–3634 McGraw-Hill, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Both acidic glycolipids such as the ganglioside GalNAcβ1–4[NeuAcα2–3]Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1′-ceramide (GM2) and neutral glycolipids such as Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1′-ceramide (Lac-Cer) are stored in NP-C tissues and cells. Because earlier studies had suggested that the NPC1 compartment functions in vesicular trafficking of multiple membrane components (10Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol.

We immunocytochemically examined with established mouse monoclonal anti-glycolipid antibodies the intracellular location of the gangliosides GM2 and GD3(NeuAcα2–8NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1–1′-ceramide) and the neutral glycolipids, Galα1–4Galβ1–4Glcβ1-ceramide (ceramide trihexoside or CTH) and (Gal-Cer/Lac-Cer) in both normal and mutant NP-C fibroblasts. In normal fibroblasts cultured with fetal bovine serum, all four internalized glycolipid pools localized to the NPC1 compartment (Fig. 4). These glycolipid pools are modulated by LDL-cholesterol. In cholesterol-depleted fibroblasts that were enriched with cholesterol by co-culture with LDL for 24 h instead of maintenance in fetal bovine serum, GM2 (Fig. 5,A–C) and Gal-Cer/Lac-Cer (Table I) remained in NPC1-positive vesicles. However, GD3 (Fig. 5 D) and CTH (Table I) now translocated to cholesterol-enriched lysosomal vesicles. In stark contrast, NP-C fibroblasts lacking NPC1 expression (Fig.6 A) did not endocytically store GM2 (Fig. 6 B) and Gal-Cer/Lac-Cer (data not shown). These lipids appear to remain at the plasma membrane. Other glycolipids such as CTH and GD3 are internalized into cholesterol-loaded lysosomes in these mutant cell lines (data not shown). The null mutant NPC1 cells were shown to synthesize normal levels of GM2 (Table II). Transfection of these cells with NPC1 cDNA re-established lysosomal cholesterol trafficking (data not shown) and re-established GM2 localization in endocytic vesicles that contained NPC1 (Fig. 6, C and D).Table IIGanglioside synthesis in normal and NP-C fibroblastsGM1GM2GM3DPM/μg proteinWT NPC1279 ± 145620 ± 33212,477 ± 5,830Mutant NPC1236 ± 18427 ± 9510,063 ± 1,237Null NPC1462 ± 151919 ± 3986,209 ± 1,026Normal and NP-C human skin fibroblasts were incubated with 10 μCi ofN-acetyl-[d-3H]mannosamine for 72 h in to label cellular pools of gangliosides and then lipids were extracted and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Normal and NP-C human skin fibroblasts were incubated with 10 μCi ofN-acetyl-[d-3H]mannosamine for 72 h in to label cellular pools of gangliosides and then lipids were extracted and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Further studies of glycolipid transfer through the NPC1 compartment were carried out with NP-C CHO cells (CT-60) that have been shown to carry an early translational termination mutation in theNPC1 gene (20Cruz J.C. Shigeki S. Chunjiang Y. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). When a population of CT-60 cells are transfected with wild type NPC1-GFP, some of the cell population appears in an early phase of fluorescent protein expression with the majority of NPC1-GFP still residing at the periphery of lysosomes that remain filled with cholesterol (Fig.7 A). These particular cells reveal no endocytic GM2 staining (Fig. 7 B). In other cells in which the NPC1-GFP protein resides in the core of endocytic vesicles (Fig. 7 C), GM2 reappears in NPC1-containing vesicles (Fig. 6 D) that are emptied of cholesterol (data not shown). The cellular profile of GD3 distribution in these transfected CT-60 cells differs entirely (Fig.8). In cells that were not transfected (Fig. 8 A), GD3 was found in lysosomes filled with cholesterol (Fig. 8 B). In cells in which NPC1-GFP p"

The R box confers p53-dependent repression on heterologous promoters and binds to p130/E2F4 in response to overexpression of p53. R box-dependent repression requires p21/waf1, and overexpression of p21/waf1 also represses the cdc2promoter.

Whereas p53 is sufficient for G1 arrest, multiple mechanisms mediate G2 arrest in response to DNA damage (3Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W.

G2 arrest occurs in cells lacking p53, possibly because of activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family member Atm, which phosphorylates and activates Chk1 and Chk2 (16Matsuoka S. Huang M.

In the present study, we demonstrate that p53 represses the cdc2promoter through a mechanism involving induction of p21/waf1 and binding of the Rb family protein p130 and the transcription factor E2F4 to the CDE and CHR elements within the R box of the cdc2promoter. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. The TR9-7 cell line, expressing a tetracycline-regulated p53 cDNA, was derived from MDAH041 cells (4Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, mimosine (Sigma), which arrests cells reversibly at the beginning of S-phase (49Hughes T.A. Cook P.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was added at a final concentration of 200 μm to asynchronously growing TR9-7 cells for 48 h. The cells were released from the mimosine block and simultaneously deprived of tetracycline to induce p53-mediated arrest, mainly in G2(4Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl.

Cell supernatant fluids were collected 48 h later, and debris was removed with a 0.2-μm filter. Viral titers were determined by infecting confluent monolayers of HEK293 cells for 2.5 h, removing the medium that contains the virus, and overlaying the cells with a solution of 1% low melting agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Infected cells were identified 72 h later by immunofluorescence with an antibody specific for the adenovirus hexon protein (Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME). Extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Extracts containing equal quantities of proteins, determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were probed with monoclonal antibodies specific for p53 (DO-1), actin (C-2), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Cdc2 (C-19), p130 (C-20), Rb (C-15), p107 (C-18), or E2F4 (C108), all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), using enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont) (4Agarwal M.L.

Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutations were generated using the polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Luciferase activity in extracts of stable pools was corrected for total protein concentrations in each lysate, determined by the Bradford method. Luciferase activity in transient transfections was corrected for transfection efficiency, determined by cotransfection of a plasmid constitutively expressing β-galactosidase. Complexes capable of binding to a consensus E2F site were detected as described by Nevins et al. (52Nevins J.R. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Leone G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 0.075% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaVO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A for 15 min on ice. Nuclei, collected by centrifugation at 1300 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min, were lysed in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 250 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 4 mm NaVO4, 4 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A for 30 min on ice. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Binding reactions contained 2 μl of lysate (3–4 μg of protein), 1 μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (0.5 mg/ml), 1.4 μl of 5× Shift buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 200 mmKCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT, and 5 mm PMSF), 1.5 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), 3.8 μl of H2O, and 0.3 μl of probe end-labeled with T4 polunucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The probe was ATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAA. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C in gels composed of 4% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1), 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-HCl, 44 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA), and 5% glycerol (53Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: B.23Google Scholar). To detect proteins binding to the cdc2 R box, gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously, with an oligonucleotide spanning this region (54Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6901-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in buffer I, containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.3m sucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mmNaVO4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in buffer I without Nonidet P-40 and immediately centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were lysed for 20 min on ice in buffer II, containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mmNaVO4, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min and dialyzed against 50 volumes of buffer III, containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmDTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF. Lysates were again centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. Binding reactions contained 8 μl of lysate (8–10 μg of protein), 1 μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (0.5 mg/ml), 8 μl of buffer III with 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 μl of end-labeled probe and 7 μl H2O. The probe was CCGGGGCCCTTTAGCGCGGTGAGTTTGAAACTGCT. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C using gels composed of 6% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (75:1), 0.5× TAE (20 mm Tris hydrochloride, 10 mm acetic acid, and 1 mmEDTA), and 5% glycerol (53Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: B.23Google Scholar). We have studied regulation of thecdc2 promoter by p53 using the TR9-7 cell line, which contains tetracycline-regulated p53 (4Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Luciferase constructs linked to regions of the cdc2 promoter were transfected into TR9-7 cells, and pools of clones in which the reporter constructs had stably integrated into the genome were analyzed. A reporter construct containing cdc2 promoter sequences from −94 to +75 was repressed ∼3-fold by p53. 2W. R. Taylor and G. R. Stark, unpublished results. However, a construct extending from −74 to +75 was not sufficient for basal promoter activity and was not repressed by p53 (28Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schönthal A.H. Katula K.S. Stark G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A CCAAT element between −94 and −74 binds to the NF-Y transcriptional activator (42Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), suggesting that repression of the cdc2promoter by p53 requires NF-Y. Because the CCAAT element is also required for basal activity of this promoter, it was possible that loss of repression by deletion of the CCAAT element might be due to a loss of basal promoter activity. For example, the construct extending to −74 might not be repressed by p53 because basal level activity is ∼40-fold lower, with repression obvious only when promoter activity is higher (28Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schönthal A.H. Katula K.S. Stark G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 42Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The −94 to +75 region of the cdc2promoter contains an additional regulatory region, called the R box (51Sugarman J.L. Schonthal A.H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), immediately upstream of the start of transcription. The R box is required for repression of the cdc2 promoter by phorbol ester (51Sugarman J.L. Schonthal A.H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test whether the R box is important for repression by p53, several chimeric constructs were stably transfected into TR9-7 cells (Fig.1). Cells were arrested in G2before analysis of luciferase activity (28Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schönthal A.H. Katula K.S. Stark G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The region −36 to +25 containing the R box was replaced with a region from the prolactin promoter from the same position relative to the start of transcription (51Sugarman J.L. Schonthal A.H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whereas the wild-type cdc2 promoter construct CC was repressed 4.4-fold, replacement of the R box region with prolactin sequences (the PP construct) completely eliminated repression by p53 (Fig. 1,A and B). Importantly, this replacement did not substantially affect the basal activity of the promoter, suggesting that the swapped region is required for repression specifically (Fig.1 A). Construct PCP generated by inserting 21 bp of thecdc2 promoter into the prolactin region, was repressed 3.8-fold by p53 (Fig. 1, A and B). However, construct CPC in which 10 bp from the prolactin promoter were inserted into the cdc2 promoter, showed a smaller repression of 2.0-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). These experiments localized the minimal region required for repression to the R box, located at nucleotides −22 to −2. The R box contains several DNA sequence elements that regulate the transcription of the cdc2 and other promoters. The cell cycle-dependent element (CDE) is 4 bp upstream from the cell cycle gene homology region (CHR) (55Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mutation of these elements in the cdc25c, cyclin A, and cdc2promoters relieves the repression that normally occurs upon arrest of the cells in G0 (55Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The CDE in the cdc2promoter overlaps a putative E2F-binding site. Binding of p130/E2F4 to this element was correlated with repression of the promoter in G0-arrested cells (54Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6901-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The factor CDF-1 can also bind to the CDE/CHR elements of the cdc2 promoter (56Liu N. Lucibello FC. Korner K. Wolfraim LA.

Constructs containing mutations in either the CDE or CHR were transfected into TR9-7 cells, and stable pools were incubated in the presence or absence of tetracycline to induce expression of p53. The wild-type promoter was repressed 5.6-fold by p53 (Fig.2 A). Mutation of either the CDE or CHR elements substantially inhibited repression by p53. The promoter with mutations in the CDE was repressed 2.3-fold by p53 (Fig.2 A). Similarly, mutations in the CHR reduced repression to 2.2-fold (Fig. 2 A). A comparison of the sequences in the chimeric and mutant promoters revealed several important points. Replacement of the first 5 bp of the putative E2F site, without altering the CDE, did not substantially affect repression (Figs. 1,A and B, and 2 B, construct PCP), whereas mutations in the CHR that maintain the putative E2F site caused a loss of repression (Figs. 1 A and 2,constructs CPC and mCHR). Mutations in the CDE that disrupt the putative E2F site also caused a loss of repression (Fig. 2, construct mCDE). These analyses localized repression of the cdc2 promoter by p53 to two distinct elements. We placed the region −74 to +75 of the cdc2 promoter, which contains the R box downstream of two different elements capable of stimulating transcription. Protein(s) bound to the R box might interact specifically with NF-Y bound to the CCAAT box between −74 and −94, thereby blocking the ability of NF-Y to activate transcription. Alternatively, the R box might bind to a repressor capable of blocking several different types of upstream activators. TR9-7 cells were stably transfected with constructs containing the R box downstream of binding sites for either AP1 or SP1, two efficient activators of transcription. AP1- and SP1-driven transcription was reduced by 2.5- and 3.0-fold by p53, respectively (Fig. 3). Wild-typecdc2 promoter sequences extending to −94 were used as a positive control. Luciferase activity driven by the cdc2promoter was reduced by 3.3-fold by p53 (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that NF-Y is not specifically targeted by the protein(s) bound to the R box. Instead, the repressor recruited to the R box in response to p53 blocks transcription induced by three different transcriptional activators. Also, the ability of the R box to inhibit transcription driven by upstream activators may explain why deletion of the CCAAT box eliminates repression (28Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A.

Our results show that overexpression of p53 without exogenous activation can repress the cdc2 promoter, suggesting that the down-regulation of cdc2 mRNA caused by DNA damage is due to repression of its promoter by p53.

Amphibians being the first group of organisms forming a connecting link between land and water are forced to adopt and survive in a variety of conditions laden with pathogenic microbes. Thereby, they are endowed with an excellent chemical defense system composed of pharmacological and antimicrobial peptides (9Clarke B.T. Biol. Rev. 1997; 72: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Bombinins were the first antimicrobial peptides characterized from the skin ofBombina variegata in 1969 (10Csordas A. Michl H. Toxicon. 1969; 7: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The discovery of magainins from the skin secretions of Xenopus laevis in 1987 (11Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar) triggered extensive search and characterization of antimicrobial peptides from amphibians (12Bevins C.L. Zasloff M. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 1998; 47: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides from genusRana share an interesting structural motif composed of a disulfide-bridged cationic heptapeptide segment at the COOH-terminal end. Peptides with this motif include brevinins and esculentins which are composed of 24 and 46 amino acids, respectively (14Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Barra D. Biopolym. Pept. Sci. 1998; 47: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The primary structures of large number of peptides belonging to this family have been determined. Another group of short peptides composed of 13 residues called temporins, which do not contain this COOH-terminal ring, have also been characterized from frogs of genusRana (15Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Canofeni S. Miele R. Mangoni M.L. Barra D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, considering the large variety of amphibian species in nature, antimicrobial peptides from only a small number of them have been characterized, that too only with respect to primary structure. Also, studies directed toward determining structure-function relationships have been confined to magainins (16Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and dermaseptins (17Mor A. Nguyen V.H. Delfour A. Migliore D. Nicolas P.

Hence, characterizing host-defense peptides from other species would be of interest and could conceivably result in the identification of new structural motifs which would be useful in designing peptides for therapeutic applications. Rana tigerina is the predominant species of frogs found in India (19Dutta S.K. Amphibians of India and Srilanka. Odyssey Publishing House, Bhubaneshwar, India1997Google Scholar). The skin of these frogs have been used traditionally by some tribal communities to heal both open and burn wounds and the antimicrobial components could possibly contribute to the wound healing process (20Longkumar, Y. (1992) Technical Report: International Conference of the I. U. C. N. SSC, ISRAG, February 23–25 Bhubaneshwar IndiaGoogle Scholar). In this study, we have described the isolation and characterization of antimicrobial peptides from R. tigerina. These peptides are composed of only ∼11–12 residues that do not have primary structural homology to any of the known antimicrobial peptides derived from amphibians. They are characterized by a disulfide-bridged loop composed of 9 amino acids. We have named these peptides as tigerinins. The frogs of the species (R. tigerina) were stimulated to release peptides through adrenergic-mediated granular gland secretion by injecting 0.5 ml of 1 mm adrenaline (Loba Chemie) into the dorsal sacs. The secretions were collected from the dorsal surface in ethanol:water (3:1, v/v) and subsequently dried under reduced pressure so as to remove ethanol and redispersed in water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Solid phase extraction on reverse phase (C18) was carried out with the clarified homogenate which involved the pumping of the extract through eight Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates) connected in series at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Bound material was sequentially eluted with 15, 30, and 60% of acetonitrile in acidified water and freeze dried. These fractions were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The frog skin secretions obtained after partial purification on Sep-Pak cartridges were redissolved in acidified water (HPLC1 pure) and purified further on an analytical reverse-phase Water's μBondapak C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The acetonitrile concentration in the eluting solvent was raised from 0 to 40% in 30 min and from 40% to 100% in 5 min. Fractions were collected according to detection at 210 nm and dried in a vacuum centrifuge and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. HPLC purified active peptide fractions were subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis using a 473 A Applied Biosystems gas phase sequencer. Cysteine residues were identified by the alkylation of the HPLC purified active peptide fractions redispersed in pyridine buffer (pH 8.3) with iodoacetamide incubated in dark for 1 h at 37 °C. Prior to treatment with iodoacetamide, dithiothreitol was added at a concentration of 10-fold molar excess over expected disulfides and nitrogen was flushed to provide an inert atmosphere throughout the reaction (21Allen G. Work T.S. Burdon R.H. Laboratory Techniques: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Sequencing of Proteins and Peptides. North Holland, Amsterdam1981: 17-42Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by using β−mercaptoethanol at a concentration of 10-fold excess to that of the peptide. The alkylated peptides were desalted, run on reverse phase C18 column and were subsequently characterized by protein sequencing and mass spectrometry. Alkylation with iodoacetamide without prior reduction with dithiothreitol was also carried out to ascertain the presence of disulfide bridges. The HPLC purified active peptide fractions as well as iodoacetamide-treated fractions were acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix and loaded on a stainless steel target and the molecular weights were determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (Kratos PC-Kompact MALDI 4VI.1.2). The status of the carboxyl terminus was investigated by digestion of the natural peptides with carboxypeptidase Y that was pretreated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inactivate endopeptidase and amidase activities (22Hayashi R. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 218: 2236-2302Google Scholar). Aliquots of the enzyme digests were taken at 1- and 2-h time points and were subjected to amino acid analysis (LKB 4151 Alpha Plus Amino acid Analyzer). Peptides identified were synthesized manually on amide crowns (Chiron technologies) by the solid phase method using Fmoc chemistry (23Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL, Oxford1989Google Scholar). All amino acids were added as Fmoc hydroxy benzotriazole active esters. The peptides were cleaved from the resin by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/phenol/water/ethanedithiol (16.5:1:1:1:0.5, v/v) overnight at room temperature. The peptides were checked for purity on HPLC using a reverse phase column (Waters μBondapak C18) using a solvent system of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. The cysteines were deprotected with mercury (II) acetate in the ratio of 2 equivalents for each equivalent of cysteine. Mercuric sulfide salts formed were precipitated with 20 eq of β-mercaptoethanol (24Veber D.F. Milkowski J.D. Vargas S.L. Denkelwalter R.G. Hirshmann S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 5456-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The peptides were then desalted and the disulfide bridges were formed with 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (25Tam J.P. Wu C.R. Liu W. Zhang J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6657-6662Crossref Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The synthesized peptides were run on C18 reverse phase HPLC column independently as well as mixing with natural peptide fractions. The synthetic peptides were then used for evaluating antimicrobial activity. Minimal inhibitory concentration of the crude 15, 30, and 60% fractions was monitored by the decrease in turbidity at 600 nm ofEscherichia coli W160.37 cells grown to logarithmic phase in minimal A medium (10.5 g of KH2PO4, 4.5 g of K2HPO4, 1 g of [NH4]2SO4, 0.5 g of sodium citrate, 0.1 mm magnesium sulfate, 0.1 g ofl-arginine, and 1% glucose in 1 liter of water) (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). For evaluating antimicrobial activity of the purified peptides, liquid culture assays were carried out wherein varying concentrations of the peptides were added to 100 μl of suspension of the organisms diluted from a midlogarithmic phase liquid culture to a concentration of 105 cells/ml in sodium phosphate buffer (27Subbalakshmi C. Krishnakumari V. Nagaraj R. Sitaram N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S.L. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The microbicidal activity was determined by counting the number of viable colony forming units on nutrient agar plates after 2 h of incubation with the individual peptides. The microorganisms used werePseudomonas putida, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The kinetics of killing was also evaluated forE. coli and S. aureus by determining the viable cell counts as a function of time. Outer membrane permeability was assessed byN-phenyl-1-N-naphthylamine (NPN, Sigma) uptake assay (29Loh B. Grant C. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 26: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). E. coli W160-37 cells were grown to late logarithmic phase in bactonutrient broth (Himedia) and the cells obtained were washed twice with 5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). A 1-ml aliquot of cells so prepared, adjusted to anA 600 of 0.5 in the same buffer containing 10 μm NPN was taken for each experiment. The excitation monochromator was set at 350 nm and the emission at 420 nm was continuously monitored after the addition of the peptide from an aqueous stock solution. Inner membrane permeability was monitored by theo-nitrophenyl-3-d-galactoside (ONPG) influx as described by Lehrer et al. (30Lehrer R.I. Burton A. Ganz T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In brief, E. coli W160-37 cells were grown to late logarithmic phase in bactonutrient broth (Himedia) in the presence of 5 × 10−4m isopropyl thiogalactoside for inducing the cytoplasmic enzyme β-galactosidase. The culture was then diluted to an A 600 of 0.03 with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing ONPG that serves as a substrate. Aliquots of this were incubated with peptides at 37 °C and the influx of ONPG into the cells was monitored by absorbance measurements at 420 and 550 nm at fixed time intervals. ONPG influx into the cells recorded as (A 420 − 1.75 ×A 550) reflects the permeability status of inner membrane. ONPG influx was monitored also in the presence of divalent cation, calcium. Hemolytic activities of the peptides were evaluated essentially as described earlier (31Sitaram N. Nagaraj R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10438-10442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using rat erythrocytes isolated from heparinized blood by centrifugation. The cells were washed three times with 5 mm HEPES buffer containing 150 mm sodium chloride. Aliquots of 1-ml suspension containing 107 cells in Eppendorf tubes were incubated with different concentrations of peptides in duplicates at 37 °C for 30 min with gentle mixing. The tubes were then centrifuged and absorbance of the supernatants was measured at 540 nm. The lysis obtained with water was considered as 100%. CD spectra of the peptides were recorded in 5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) in a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter in 0.1-cm path-length cells at 25 °C. Calibration was carried out with d 10-camphor sulfonic acid. CD band intensities are represented as mean residue ellipticity. The starting structures were generated in extended conformation with φ,ψ = −180o for nonproline residues and φ,ψ = −75o, −180o for prolines using BIOPOLYMER module of MSI of version 98. The cysteines were bonded to form a disulfide bridge. These structures were minimized for a short duration to remove bad contacts. The structures were then optimized using a combination of minimizers like Steepest Descent, Conjugate Gradient, and Newton Raphson's methods for 3000 iterations till a final convergence of 0.001 was achieved. The Amber force field “amber.frc” provided in the MSI 98 (Biosym technologies, San Diego) was used for all calculations. The final structures were equilibrated for 10 ps duration before they were subjected to dynamics of 500 ps at a constant temperature of 298 K using a NVT ensemble temperature control method. The velocity-verlet integration method was used in this case. The final structures were once again minimized for 3000 iterations to achieve a convergence of 0.001. The optimization and Molecular Dynamics (MD) studies were conducted by using DISCOVER module provided in MSI 98. The dihedral angles for the final structures were calculated by using STRIDE software program developed by Patrick Argos of EMBL (32Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). The Procheck Program indicated that all the dihedral angles were in the allowed regions in the Ramachandran map. The lyophilized material obtained from the adrenaline-stimulated skin secretions or the skin extracts of R. tigerina was initially processed on Sep-Pak cartridges. The fraction that eluted between 15 and 30% acetonitrile contained all the antimicrobial activity against E. coli. This fraction was subjected to further fractionation on a μBondapak C18 column. A chromatogram obtained is shown in Fig.1. The peaks eluting at 21.57, 23.40, and 24.10 min exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli. Mass spectral analysis yielded mass values of 1342, 1368, and 1409, respectively (Fig. 2, A-C). Amino acid sequence analysis indicated the sequences as F_TMIPIPR_Y, RV_FAIPLPI_H, and RV_YAIPLPI_Y. To determine whether the gaps in the sequences could arise due to the presence of cysteine residues, the peptides were alkylated with iodoacetamide, purified on HPLC, and subjected to mass spectral analysis. The data shown in Fig.2, D-F, indicate mass increases which correspond to the alkylation of two cysteine residues. When sequencing of the modified peptides were carried out, the alkylated cysteine residues eluted at the blank positions observed for unmodified cysteines. We have named these peptides as tigerinins. Treatment of tigerinins with carboxypeptidase Y did not result in the release of free amino acids under conditions where free amino acids were released from peptides with free COOH-terminal COOH groups, indicating that the COOH-terminal ends of tigerinins 1, 2, and 3 were amidated. The peptides on alkylation with iodoacetamide, without prior reduction with dithiothreitol, did not yield the alkylated derivatives of cysteine indicating that the two cysteine residues were linked by a disulfide bridge. The sequences of the peptides were further confirmed by chemical synthesis. The synthetic peptides coeluted with their natural counterparts on HPLC and exhibited identical mass values. Reproducible HPLC profiles were obtained with different batches of skin secretions. When the skin extracts were processed using similar protocols, along with the other three peptides an additional peptide, which coeluted with tigerinin 3, with a mass of 1247 was obtained. On treatment with iodoacetamide, this peptide could be separated from tigerinin 3. On the basis of sequence and mass spectral analysis, the primary structure of this peptide is RVCYAIPLPIC-amide. The primary structures of the peptides are summarized in TableI.Figure 2Mass spectroscopic analysis of peptides. A-C are the mass spectra of the peaks obtained by HPLC with retention times 21.57, 23.40, and 24.10 min, respectively.D-F, correspond to mass spectra of the peptides inA-C after treatment with iodoacetamide and purified on HPLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISequences of antimicrobial peptides from R. tigerinaPeptideSequenceTigerinin 1FCTMIPIPRCY-AmTigerinin 2RVCFAIPLPICH-AmTigerinin 3RVCYAIPLPICY-AmTigerinin 4RVCYAIPLPIC-AmAm, COOH-terminal amide.

All the peptides exhibit activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as yeast with minimal inhibitory concentrations varying between 30 and 100 μg/ml. The bactericidal activity of tigerinins was investigated by studying the kinetics of killing of two representative organisms, E. coli and S. aureus. The results are shown in Fig.3. In the first 5 min of incubation itself, between 60 and 80% of cells are killed in the case of all the peptides, even at the lowest concentration of 10 μg/ml. Complete killing is seen between 30 and 120 min. While tigerinin 1 is the most active peptide for S. aureus, tigerinin 2 is the most active on E. coli.

Trends Biotech. 1998; 16: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) and hence the ability of tigerinins to permeabilize the bacterial membranes was examined. The extent to which E. coli OM becomes permeable to NPN in the presence of tigerinins is shown in Fig.4. Tigerinin 1 is most effective in permeabilizing the OM of E. coli and tigerinin 2 and 3 are marginally less active with 50% permeabilizing concentrations (PC50) of 12, 15, and 22 μg/ml, respectively. Tigerinin 4 also possesses considerable OM permeabilizing ability. However, the linear analog of tigerinin 1 (i.e. S-acetamido protected derivative) did not exhibit antimicrobial activity and also did not permeabilize the OM of E. coli. Hence, the S-S bridge appears to be essential for activity. To determine whether tigerinins are capable of permeabilizing the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane (IM) of E. coli, the influx of the chromogenic substrate of the cytoplasmic enzyme β-galactosidase, ONPG in the absence and presence of the peptides was monitored. The data is presented in Fig. 5 A. It is evident that tigerinins permeabilize the IM of E. colieffectively. As tigerinin 2 is the most effective, among tigerinins, in permeabilizing the IM of E. coli, the effect of stabilizing the OM with Ca2+ (33Nikaiodo H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on its IM permeabilizing ability was also investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 5 B. Ca2+, at a concentration of 600 μm, almost completely inhibited IM permeabilization by tigerinin. Tigerinins are thus unable to permeabilize a stabilized OM, suggesting that OM permeabilization is an essential and critical step for its activity. The CD spectra of tigerinins 1–4 in buffer are shown in Fig. 6. All the peptides show a minimum ∼204 nm with crossover at wavelengths <195 nm. The spectra indicate a population of unordered and β-turn conformations (34Perczel A. Hollosi M. Foxman B.M. Fasman G.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9772-9784Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The conformations of tigerinins 1, 2, and 3 were analyzed by theoretical methods involving energy minimization and Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Comparison of the structures are shown in Fig. 7. The dihedral angles of the structures obtained after 500 ps Molecular Dynamics Simulations for both the peptides with those documented for standard β-turn types (35Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M.

The susceptible microorganisms include Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as yeast with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the range of 30 to 100 μg/ml. These three peptides exhibit high homology among themselves, with COOH-terminal amidation and a disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues to form a nonapeptide ring but are not related to any described previously antimicrobial peptides from amphibians. Extensive homology searches from the protein data banks did not yield any other peptide homologous to these peptides. These three peptides were also obtained from the skin extracts of R. tigerina. An additional peptide of 11 residues which lacked the COOH-terminal Tyr in tigerinin 3, but marginally less active than tigerinin 3 on all the organisms tested, was also obtained from the skin extracts. None of the peptides exhibited any hemolytic activity up to a concentration of 200 μg/ml. Tigerinins with 11 and 12 residues are the smallest antimicrobial peptides characterized from amphibians and are different from temporins which are linear peptides with 13 residues (15Simmaco M.

Of these, the first seven families of peptides are all characterized by a highly basic, heptapeptide loop linked by a disulfide bridge at the COOH-terminal end, but with a highly variable sequence and length at the NH2-terminal end. However, the presence of the disulfide bridge does not appear to be critical either for activity or for structure in the case of Rana peptides identified so far (42Kwon M.Y. Hong S.Y. Lee K.H.

The primary structures of tigerinins are compared with other amphibian peptides in TableIII which evidently indicates no sequence homology. It is thus unlikely that tigerinins are derived from similar class of peptides from R. tigerina. All the amphibian antimicrobial peptides, including the Ranapeptides, known thus far, are known to adopt helical structure (15Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Canofeni S. Miele R. Mangoni M.L. Barra D. Eur. J.

Conformational analysis by CD and theoretical methods suggest β-turn conformations for tigerinins and these represent the first examples of nonhelical amphibian antimicrobial peptides. A majority of cationic antimicrobial peptides (1Saberwal G. Nagaraj R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 6Sitaram N. Nagaraj R. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and dermaseptins (17Mor A. Nguyen V.H. Delfour A. Migliore D. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8824-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 18Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), are known to exert their antimicrobial activity by permeabilizing the cytoplasmic membrane. Despite being structurally distinct from other amphibian antimicrobial peptides, tigerinins also are capable of permeabilizing bacterial membranes. While it is conceivable that tigerinins also exert their antimicrobial activity by permeabilizing the microbial membranes, other mechanisms cannot be ruled out. Indolicidin, a 13-residue Trp-rich antimicrobial peptide from bovine neutrophils, which is known to permeabilize the outer and cytoplasmic membranes of E. coli also preferentially inhibits synthesis of DNA leading to filamentation of cells (46Subbalakshmi C. Sitaram N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 160: 91-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This later mechanism appears to contribute to its antimicrobial activity. Recently, many other cationic antimicrobial peptides have been proposed to kill bacteria by alternate mechanisms (47Wu M. Maier E. Benz R. Hancock R.E.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7235-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Like all other amphibian antimicrobial peptides (10Csordas A. Michl H. Toxicon. 1969; 7: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 12Bevins C.L.

Sci. 1998; 47: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), tigerinins are also cationic (Table III). All of them carry a charge of +2 with 1 Arg residue and amidated COOH-terminal end. This low cationicity appears to be sufficient for its biological activity. Earlier we have shown that SPF, a 13-residue synthetic peptide corresponding to the most hydrophobic region of bovine seminal plasmin, with a charge of +1, has both antimicrobial and hemolytic activity (31Sitaram N. Nagaraj R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10438-10442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from brevinins, another antimicrobial peptide, with a single disulfide bond, that is well characterized is thanatin from the hemipteran insect Podisus maculiventus. Thanatin is a 21-residue peptide with 50% homology to brevinins (48Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Chemysh S. Briand J.P. Roussel J.P. Letelbier L. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to a heptapeptide loop at the COOH-terminal end of brevenins, thanatin has an eight-membered ring. Despite the homology, the secondary structure and mechanism of action differs from that of brevenin. Thanatin appears to assume a β-turn structure stabilized by a disulfide bond and is suggested to exert its action by a nonpore forming mechanism.Table IIIRepresentative primary structures of antimicrobial peptides from amphibian skinNameSourceSequenceNet charge at pH 7Magainin 2X. laevisGIGKFLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS+3Dermaseptin S1Phylomedusa sauvagilALWKTMLKKLGTMALHAGKAALGAAADTISQGTQ+3Brevinin-1Rana brevipodaFLPVLAGIAAKVVPALFCKITKKC+4Esculentin-1Rana esculentaGIFSKLGRKKIKNLLISGLKNVGKEVGMDVVRTGIDAGOKIK)GEC+6Gaegurin 5Rana rugosaFLGALFKVASKVLPSVKCAImTKKC+5RanalexinRana catesbianaFFGGLIKIVPAMIPKIFCKITRKC+5Ranateurin 4R. temporariaFLPFIARLAAKVFPSIIC)SVTKKC+4Temporin AR. temporariaFLPLIGRVLSGIL-Am+2Tigerinin 1R. tigerinaFCTMIPIPRCY-Am+2Tigerinin 2R. tigerinaRVCFAIPLPICH-Am+2Tigerinin 3R. tigerinaRVCYAIPLPICY-Am+2Am-amide.

Open table in a new tab Am-amide. Cationic residues are in bold, hydrophobic residues are in bold italics. All the cysteine residues in cysteine containing rana peptides and tigerinins are linked by intramolecular disulfide bridge. The only other short antibacterial peptide with a similar nonapeptide disulfide linkage is bactenecin which has been isolated from bovine neutrophils (49Romeo D. Skerlavaj B. Bolognesi M. Gennaro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 263: 9573-9575Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, bactenecin has 4 arginine residues as compared with one in tigerinins and therefore considerably more cationic. Reduction of the single disulfide bond in bactenecin was observed to result in a drastic change in the antibacterial spectrum (50Wu M. Hancock R.E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The reduced bactenecin showed high selectivity for Gram-positive bacteria with little activity against Gram-negative bacteria whereas native bactenecin was more active against Gram-negative bacteria. In tigerinin, absence of disulfide bridge resulted in loss of antibacterial activity indicating the importance of disulfide bridge for activity. It is very unlikely that tigerinins are related to bactenecins. Thus, this paper describes a family of short and nonhelical antimicrobial peptides in amphibians. As short peptides have the obvious advantage of easy chemical synthesis, the new structural motif observed in tigerinins would be easily amenable for the synthesis of analogs with improved activity and conceivably useful against multidrug-resistant microbes. We are currently investigating other pharmacological activities of peptides from the skin secretions ofRana tigerina. We thank V. M. Dhople for amino acid analysis, Dr. S.

https://openalex.org/W2030844021,"Cell death processes are progressively inactivated during malignant development, in part by loss of tumor suppressors that can promote cell death. The Bin1 gene encodes a nucleocytosolic adaptor protein with tumor suppressor properties, initially identified through its ability to interact with and inhibit malignant transformation by c-Myc and other oncogenes. Bin1 is frequently missing or functionally inactivated in breast and prostate cancers and in melanoma. In this study, we show that Bin1 engages a caspase-independent cell death process similar to type II apoptosis, characterized by cell shrinkage, substratum detachment, vacuolated cytoplasm, and DNA degradation. Cell death induction was relieved by mutation of the BAR domain, a putative effector domain, or by a missplicing event that occurs in melanoma and inactivates suppressor activity. Cells in all phases of the cell cycle were susceptible to death and p53 and Rb were dispensable. Notably, Bin1 did not activate caspases and the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor ZVAD.fmk did not block cell death. Consistent with the lack of caspase involvement, dying cells lacked nucleosomal DNA cleavage and nuclear lamina degradation. Moreover, neither Bcl-2 or dominant inhibition of the Fas pathway had any effect. In previous work, we showed that Bin1 could not suppress cell transformation by SV40 large T antigen. Consistent with this finding, we observed that T antigen suppressed the death program engaged by Bin1. This observation was interesting in light of emerging evidence that T antigen has roles in cell immortalization and human cell transformation beyond Rb and p53 inactivation. In support of a link to c-Myc-induced death processes, AEBSF, a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits apoptosis by c-Myc, potently suppressed DNA degradation by Bin1. Our findings suggest that the tumor suppressor activity of Bin1 reflects engagement of a unique cell death program. We propose that loss of Bin1 may promote malignancy by blunting death penalties associated with oncogene activation."

https://openalex.org/W2018652547,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a complex DNA virus that employs polyprotein processing at Gly-Gly-Xaa sites as a strategy to produce several major core components of the viral particle. The virus gene S273R encodes a 31-kDa protein that contains a “core domain” with the conserved catalytic residues characteristic of SUMO-1-specific proteases and the adenovirus protease. Using a COS cell expression system, it was found that protein pS273R is capable of cleaving the viral polyproteins pp62 and pp220 in a specific way giving rise to the same intermediates and mature products as those produced in ASFV-infected cells. Furthermore, protein pS273R, like adenovirus protease and SUMO-1-specific enzymes, is a cysteine protease, because its activity is abolished by mutation of the predicted catalytic histidine and cysteine residues and is inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. Protein pS273R is expressed late after infection and is localized in the cytoplasmic viral factories, where it is found associated with virus precursors and mature virions. In the virions, the protein is present in the core shell, a domain where the products of the viral polyproteins are also located. The identification of the ASFV protease will allow a better understanding of the role of polyprotein processing in virus assembly and may contribute to our knowledge of the emerging family of SUMO-1-specific proteases.

All the proteolytic cleavages occur after the second Gly of the consensus sequence Gly-Gly-Xaa, which is also recognized as a cleavage site in the maturation of adenovirus structural proteins and in some cellular proteins, including polyubiquitin (9López-Otı́n C.

Although the adenovirus protease that processes at Gly-Gly-Xaa sites is well characterized (13Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G.

Recently, Li and Hochstrasser (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) have described a novel cysteine protease from yeast, designated Ulp-1, that catalyzes the release of the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1/Smt3 from its precursor or from sumoylated proteins, with the cleavage taking place at Gly-Gly-Xaa sequences. Since the publication of this report, other SUMO-1-specific proteases similar to the yeast enzyme have been identified in vertebrates (17Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Saitoh H. Kawakami T. Omata M.

These proteases would regulate the SUMO-1-modified state of certain proteins whose function in a variety of cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression and nuclear import, is dependent on this modification (20Yeh E.T.H. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Li and Hochstrasser (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) have also shown that a “core domain” of ∼90 amino acids of the yeast protease, containing the conserved catalytic cysteine and histidine residues, presents some similarity to gene products from several animal viruses, including the adenovirus L3 protease, the I7 products of fowlpox and vaccinia virus, and open reading frame (ORF) S273R of ASFV. This suggested that the S273R product might be the protease involved in the processing of the ASFV polyproteins. We show here, using an expression system in COS cells, the specific processing of polyproteins pp62 and pp220 in the presence of protein pS273R. Furthermore, inhibitor profiling and site-directed mutagenesis results indicate that this protein is a cysteine protease. Studies on the synthesis and localization of protein pS273R during ASFV infection are also presented. The results are consistent with a role for the virus protease in the assembly of the virus core. Vero and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. The Vero-adapted ASFV strain BA71V was propagated and titrated as described previously (21Enjuanes L. Carrascosa A.L. Moreno M.A. Viñuela E. J. Gen. Virol. 1976; 32: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Highly purified ASFV was prepared as described (22Carrascosa A.L. del Val M. Santarén J.F. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 337-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (23Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) was kindly donated by Dr. B. Moss. Plasmid pRSET-S273R carrying the ASFV S273R gene as an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion was obtained as follows. The S273R gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides 273-PCR1 (5′-CGCGCGCTCGAGATGTCTATATTAGAAAAAATTACGT) and 273-PCR2 (5′-GCGCGCGAATTCTTATGCGATGCGAAACAGATGGGT), digested with XhoI and EcoRI, and cloned into the pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen). The S273R gene was subcloned from pRSET-S273R into the T7 promoter containing mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen), and the recombinant plasmid pcDNA-S273R was used for activity assays in transfection experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis of the S273R gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction (24Herlitze S. Koenen M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using as a template the pcDNA-S273R plasmid. The histidine residue at position 168 was mutated to arginine (S273R,H168R mutant) and cysteine 232 was mutated to serine (S273R,C232S mutant). Amplified mutant fragments corresponding to the complete S273R gene were cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector, and the presence of the desired mutation and absence of additional changes were confirmed by sequencing of the resulting plasmids. The recombinant plasmid KS-CP530R containing ORF CP530R, which encodes the pp62 polyprotein of 530 amino acids under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter, was obtained as described (7Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Almazán F. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5799-5804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid KS-p17C′f, used for the generation of antibodies against both polyprotein pp62 and its mature p35 product, was obtained as follows. The plasmid KS-CP530R was digested with PstI, blunted with Mung Bean exonuclease, and then digested with Mlu I and filled in with Klenow fragment. After ligation, this recombinant plasmid lacks the region spanning amino acid residues 15–175 of pp62 polyprotein. This plasmid was again digested with XhoI to remove the 3′ end of ORF CP530R spanning amino acid residues 343–530. Plasmid pGEM-CP2475L was constructed by cloning the 0.7-kb XbaI /PstI fragment from plasmid pAR-p34 (6Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Viñuela E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2977-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the 6.9-kb PstI/XbaI fragment of the RC′ restriction fragment of the ASFV genome (5Yáñez R.J. Rodrı́guez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enrı́quez C. Rodriguez J.F. Viñuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) into vector pGEM-4 (Promega). The resulting plasmid contained the complete CP2475L ORF, encoding polyprotein pp220, under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter. To prepare antibodies against protein pS273R,Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells harboring the pRSET-S273R plasmid were induced for 1.5 h with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the recombinant protein was purified under denaturing conditions using single-step Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Antibodies against the purified recombinant pS273R protein were raised in rabbits. The mouse monoclonal antibody 18H.H7, which recognizes both the ASFV polyprotein pp220 and its mature product p150, was used in the immunofluorescence studies. This antibody, as well as the rabbit polyclonal anti-p150, anti-p34, and anti-p37/p14 sera, which also recognize polyprotein pp220, have been previously characterized (6Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Viñuela E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2977-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Andrés G. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Sanz A. Garcı́a-Barreno B. Nogal M.L. Viñuela E. Enjuanes L. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 199-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal serum against proteins pp62 and p35 was raised against the 17-kDa recombinant protein encoded by plasmid KS-p17C′f. For this, KS-p17C′f transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were induced for 2 h with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and then incubated for 2 h with rifampicin (0.2 mg/ml). After lysis and centrifugation, the pellet containing the recombinant protein as the main component was used to generate antibodies in rabbits. The rabbit polyclonal serum against ASFV polyprotein pp62 and its mature product p15 has already been described (7Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Almazán F. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5799-5804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with 250 ng of DNA/105 cells of the plasmids indicated in each case using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's indications for 1 h at 37 °C. In cotransfection experiments, the amount of pcDNA-S273R was110 of that of the polyprotein gene-containing plasmid. Subsequently, the cells were infected with vTF7-3 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell, allowing the expression of T7 RNA polymerase and thus of the polyprotein and S273R genes. The infection was carried out in the presence of 40 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside to inhibit vaccinia virus late protein synthesis. The expression and processing of the polyprotein was analyzed at 16 h post-infection by Western blot, as indicated below. COS-7 cells were transfected/infected as described before using the corresponding plasmids. At 16 h post-infection, the cells were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in homogenization buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.28 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and passed through a 25-gauge syringe 15 times. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min to sediment nuclei and unbroken cells, and the supernatant fraction was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the soluble cytoplasm from the membrane/particulate material. The activity assays in vitro were performed using the soluble cytoplasmic fraction as source of protein pS273R and polyprotein pp62 and the membrane/particulate cytoplasmic fraction as a source of polyprotein pp220. Reactions were performed at 30 °C in a final volume of 50 μl containing 5 μl of both protease and polyprotein-containing extracts diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. After the indicated times, the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. For inhibitor studies, the reactions were incubated for 6 h as above in the absence or in the presence of the following protease inhibitors: 10 μm pepstatin, 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 100 μmbenzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-valyl-glycyl-diazomethylketone (Z-LVG-CHN2), or 100 μm l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide-(4-guanidino)-butane (E-64). All the inhibitors were freshly prepared as a 100-fold concentrated stock solution in methanol with the exception of Z-LVG-CHN2 and E-64, prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and water, respectively. For Western blots, equivalent amounts of whole cell extracts or cytosolic fractions were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of the antibodies and then with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit serum (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the proteins were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Vero cells were mock-infected or infected with ASFV (BA71V strain) at a multiplicity of 20 plaque-forming units/cell. To obtain early RNA, the cells were infected in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide or 40 μg/ml cytosine arabinoside for 7 h. Late RNA was isolated from cells infected for 18 h in the absence of inhibitors. Whole cell RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride extraction procedure (26Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. McDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar), and poly (A)+ RNA was selected by oligo (dT)-cellulose chromatography as described by Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 7.26–7.29 and 7.79–7.83 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Northern blot hybridization was carried out as reported elsewhere (28Yáñez R.J. Rodrı́guez J.M Salas M.L. Viñuela E. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with 2 μg of each class of poly (A)+ RNA, using as probe the 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide S273R (5′-TACTTAAACAGCTATCTTTGTTTGTAAGGT), complementary to nucleotides +79 to +50 of gene S273R. Primer extension analysis was performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 7.26–7.29 and 7.79–7.83 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). After 5′ end-labeling with 32P, the oligonucleotide S273R was annealed at 30 °C to the different classes of RNA and extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for 2 h at 42 °C. The primer extension products were then electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel alongside an irrelevant DNA sequence reaction. Vero cells grown on coverslips were mock-infected or infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of infection of 1 plaque-forming unit/cell and fixed at 18 h post-infection with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. The cells were incubated with a 1:250 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-pS273R serum and a 1:10 dilution of mouse monoclonal (18H.H7) anti-pp220 antibody as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5 and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and a 1:500 dilution of Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.). As a control, each antibody was individually tested. Cells were examined with an Axiovert fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Vero cells were infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell and fixed, at 20 h post-infection, with 4% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, for 1 h at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were processed for cryosectioning as detailed by Andrés et al. (29Andrés G. Garcı́a-Escudero R. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8988-9001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrathin thawed cryosections were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with a 1:10 dilution of the anti-pS273R antibody followed by an incubation of 30 min at room temperature with a 1:40 dilution of protein A-gold (diameter, 10 nm; Biocell Research Laboratories). Specimens were examined with a Jeol 1010 microscope. To investigate the putative protease activity of protein pS273R, we have used a system of COS-7 cells transiently coexpressing the S273R gene and the genes coding for polyprotein pp62 and polyprotein pp220, which served as substrates. During ASFV infection, polyprotein pp62 is first cleaved at a Gly-Gly-Gly sequence at positions 157–159 to produce the 15-kDa structural protein p15 and an intermediate precursor of 46 kDa (pp46). A second cleavage at the Gly-Gly-Asn site at positions 462–464 gives rise to the mature structural protein p35 of 35 kDa and to an 8-kDa polypeptide that has not been detected in the infected cells (7Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Almazán F. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5799-5804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A, upper diagram). An alternative, although minor, processing pathway, described in the lower diagram of Fig.1 A, has also been found.2 In this case, processing first takes place at the most C-terminal cleavage site, producing an intermediate pp52 precursor of 52 kDa. Cleavage of this intermediate at the Gly-Gly-Gly sequence at position 157–159 then produces the two structural proteins p15 and p35. As shown in Fig. 1 B (lanes 3 of topand middle panels), a specific band corresponding to the unprocessed pp62 polyprotein was detected by Western blot using both anti-p35 and anti-p15 antibodies in lysates from cells transfected with the polyprotein gene and infected with vTF7-3. When the polyprotein was coexpressed with the S273R gene (Fig. 1 B, top and middle panels, lanes 4), the pp62 band strongly decreased coinciding with the appearance of the proteolytic products p35 (upper panel) and p15 (middle panel), which had the same electrophoretic mobility as the structural proteins p35 and p15 detected in the samples of highly purified ASFV (Fig.1 B, top and middle panels, lanes 5). In addition, the pp46 intermediate could be detected with the anti-p35 serum, whereas the antibody against protein p15 revealed a specific band of 52 kDa, which probably corresponds to pp52 precursor. The expression of gene S273R in the transfected cells is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1 B. The protein had a size of 31 kDa, which is consistent with its predicted molecular weight of 31,550 (30Garcı́a-Beato R. Freije J.M. López-Otı́n C. Blasco R. Viñuela E. Salas M.L. Virology. 1992; 188: 938-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B (bottom panel,lane 5), protein pS273R was also detected in purified virus particles. To assay the activity of protein pS273R in vitro, cytosolic extracts from COS-7 cells expressing protein pS273R or polyprotein pp62, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were mixed and incubated for varying time periods, as indicated in Fig.1 C. After incubation, the samples were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against proteins p35 (upper panel) or p15 (lower panel). Fig. 1 C shows that in the presence of pS273R polyprotein pp62 is processed in a time-dependent and cascade fashion, with the formation of pp52 and pp46 intermediates, which are converted to the mature p35 and p15 products. As can also be seen in this figure, the p15 product, detected at the earliest time examined (15 min), increased at 1 h, and remained constant at later times, whereas the amount of the mature protein p35 increased considerably from 1 to 3 h of incubation. These results suggest that, as it occurs during ASFV infection (7Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Almazán F. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5799-5804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the main initial event in the in vitro processing of pp62 by protein pS273R is the recognition of the cleavage site at position 158–159, with the formation of the mature p15 protein and preprotein pp46. This latter protein would then be cleaved at positions 463–464 to produce the mature protein p35. A similar in vitro assay was performed to analyze whether protein pS273R was also able to cleave polyprotein pp220 into its mature products. During ASFV infection, polyprotein pp220 is firstly cleaved at the Gly-Gly-Gly sequence at positions 43–45 and the Gly-Gly-Ala sequence at positions 892–894 to give rise to the mature product p150 and the intermediate precursor protein pp90 (6Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Viñuela E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2977-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). Preprotein pp90 is subsequently cleaved at a Gly-Gly-Asp sequence at positions 367–369 to generate the mature protein p34 and the intermediate precursor pp55, which is finally processed at a Gly-Gly-Ala site at positions 521–523 to produce the mature products p14 and p37. As shown in Fig.2 B (lanes 1), the antibodies against products p150 (top panel), p34 (middle panel), and p37 and p14 (bottom panel) detected the unprocessed pp220 polyprotein in pp220 containing extracts incubated for 6 h in the absence of protein pS273R. Additionally, lower molecular weight bands, probably corresponding to incomplete forms of the pp220 polyprotein produced in the transfected cells, were observed. After incubation with pS273R containing extracts for 1 h (lanes 2), 3 h (lanes 3), and 6 h (lanes 4), the levels of polyprotein pp220 decreased in a time-dependent fashion coinciding with the appearance and accumulation of proteins of 150 kDa (upper panel), 34 kDa (middle panel), and, more weakly, of 37 kDa, which was only visualized after a longer exposure time (lower panel). These proteolytic products comigrated with the mature proteins p150, p34, and p37 present in samples of purified ASFV particles (lanes 5). Interestingly, a 90-kDa protein was also specifically detected by the antibodies against protein p34 (middle panel, lanes 2–4) and proteins p37/p14 (l ower panel, lanes 2–4), whereas a 55-kDa protein was recognized only by the anti-p37/p14 serum (l ower panel, lanes 2–4). The detection of these proteins is consistent with the formation of the intermediate precursors pp90 and pp55 (Fig. 2 A). The other mature product p14 could not be detected in the in vitro assays because of the poor recognition of protein p14 by Western blot analysis (see lane 5 in the lower panel) and, possibly, because of a low efficiency of processing of precursor pp55. These results indicate that the two ASFV polyproteins pp220 and pp62 are accurately cleaved in the presence of protein pS273R to give rise to the same mature products and intermediate precursors as those produced during ASFV infection. As reported by Li and Hochstrasser (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) and shown in the alignment of Fig.3 A, the ASFV protein pS273R conserves near its C terminus the catalytic core domain of the SUMO-1-specific proteases and the adenovirus protease containing the four key catalytic residues, His, Glu/Asp (Asn in the case of the ASFV protein), Gln, and Cys, which are characteristic of cysteine proteases. To investigate whether the ASFV protein was also a cysteine protease, a number of inhibitors specific for the different classes of proteases were tested using the in vitro assay described above. As shown in Fig. 3 B, inhibitors of aspartic proteases (pepstatin), metallo-proteases (1,10-phenanthroline), or serine proteases (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) had no effect on pp62 processing. On the other hand, two cysteine protease inhibitors,N-ethylmaleimide and the peptidyl diazomethane Z-Leu-Val-Gly-CHN2, completely or partially blocked, respectively, the cleavage of the polyprotein. It is of interest to note that E-64, which is also a specific inhibitor of cysteine proteases, did not inhibit the processing activity of protein pS273R. In this connection, it should be mentioned that the adenovirus protease is also relatively insensitive to this compound (31Tihanyi K. Bourbonnière M. Houde A. Rancourt C. Weber J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1780-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sircar S. Ruzindana-Umunyana A. Neugebauer W. Weber J.M. Antiviral Res. 1998; 40: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To further characterize the pS273R protein as a cysteine protease, the conserved cysteine and histidine residues of the putative catalytic domain were mutated to serine and arginine, respectively, and the activity of the mutant proteins was tested. As shown in Fig.3 C, no cleavage was detected with the pS273R-C232S or pS273R-H168R mutants, indicating that the conserved cysteine and histidine residues are indeed critical for the activity of protein pS273R. To study the transcription of gene S273R during ASFV infection, RNA hybridization and primer extension analysis were carried out with the32P-labeled oligonucleotide S273R (see “Experimental Procedures”) specific for ORF S273R. Hybridization of this oligonucleotide to Northern blots containing RNA from mock-infected cells and early (cycloheximide and cytosine arabinoside) and late RNA from cells infected with ASFV showed a main band of 4.5 kb, as well as other species, in the late RNA sample (Fig.4 A). Primer extension analysis revealed a main band of 93 nucleotides that was detected only in the case of the late RNA sample (Fig. 4 B) and corresponded to initiation of transcription at position −15 relative to the first nucleotide of the translation start codon of ORF S273R. A motif composed of seven or more consecutive thymidylate residues (the 7T motif) has been identified as a signal for 3′-end formation of ASFV mRNAs (33Almazán F. Rodrı́guez J.M. Andrés G. Pérez R. Viñuela E. Rodriguez J.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6655-6667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first 7T motif after ORF S273R is found 52 nucleotides downstream of the contiguous P1192R ORF coding for the virus topoisomerase II (30Garcı́a-Beato R. Freije J.M. López-Otı́n C. Blasco R. Viñuela E. Salas M.L. Virology. 1992; 188: 938-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Termination of transcription at this motif would produce an RNA of 4497 bases, which is consistent with the size of the main RNA band detected by Northern blot. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of a specific band migrating at the expected position for protein pS273R (31 kDa) in ASFV-infected cells (Fig. 4 C). This band was first detected at 8 h post-infection, a time at which viral DNA replication in Vero cells is already underway (34Salas M.L. Rey-Campos J. Almendral J.M. Talavera A. Viñuela E. Virology. 1986; 152: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and accumulated up to 20 h post-infection. Furthermore, the protein band was not seen in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of viral DNA replication and late transcription, indicating that protein pS273R is a late protein. As can also be seen in this figure, protein pS273R synthesized in the infected cells comigrated with that present in purified virus particles (Fig. 4 C, lane 9). To study the intracellular localization of pS273R protein, mock-infected and ASFV-infected Vero cells were fixed at 18 h after infection and analyzed by immunofluorescence with the anti-pS273R serum. As shown in Fig. 5 A, a low background signal was observed in the mock-infected cells used as a control. In contrast, the antibody against protein pS273R strongly stained discrete cytoplasmic areas of the virus-infected cells (Fig. 5 B), which were identified as virus factories by immunolabeling with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the polyprotein precursor pp220 and its mature product p150 (Fig. 5 C) (8Andrés G. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported, the antibody to pp220/p150 proteins also labeled virus particles scattered throughout the cytoplasm (8Andrés G. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although more weakly, the anti-pS273R serum also stained cytoplasmic clusters of virions outside the assembly areas (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that protein pS273R is incorporated into the virus particles, in agreement with the immunoblotting experiments performed with purified virions. To examine in more detail the localization of ASFV protease within the virus factories, we carried out an immunoelectron microscopic analysis of Vero cells infected with ASFV for 20 h. For this, thawed cryosections were incubated with the anti-pS273R antibody followed by protein A-gold. As shown in Fig.6 A, the antibody labeled the region of the viral factories, in keeping with the immunofluorescence results. Within the assembly sites, labeling was essentially associated with both intermediate virus structures (Fig. 6 B) and mature virions (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, gold grains were localized within the core region of immature icosahedral particles that lack the electron dense DNA-containing nucleoid. Within mature particles, the signal was associated with the core shell (Fig. 6 C), the protein domain surrounding the electron dense nucleoid and containing the polyprotein products (8Andrés G. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A new family of structurally related cysteine proteases that process SUMO-1-modified proteins at consensus Gly-Gly-Xaa sequences has been recently described (16Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between the members of this family is largely confined to a C-terminal region of about 200 amino acids that contains a 90-amino acid core domain that is also present in the adenovirus protease, as well as in the poxvirus I7 protein and protein pS273R of ASFV. This core domain contains the active site triad of the adenovirus protease, composed of residues His54, Glu71, and Cys122, which in the crystal structure of this enzyme have a spatial disposition identical to that of the catalytic triad of the classical cysteine protease papain (35Drenth J. Kalk K.H. Swen H.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), although the sequential order of the residues in the polypeptide chain of this enzyme is Cys25, His159, and Asn175. In addition, a fourth residue, Gln115, of the adenovirus protease is in an equivalent spatial position to the Gln19 of papain involved in the formation of the oxyanion hole in the active site. The ASFV protein pS273R conserves the His, Cys, and Gln residues, and, as in the case of papain, has an Asn at the position of the adenovirus protease Glu71 residue. This sequence similarity strongly argued that this protein was the protease implicated in the proteolytic processing of ASFV polyproteins at Gly-Gly-Xaa sites. The results presented here show that protein pS273R processes the virus polyproteins in a specific and accurate way giving rise to the same intermediates and final mature products as those produced in ASFV-infected cells, suggesting that this protein is the protease involved in polyprotein processing during the infection. Furthermore, and as expected from the sequence comparison, the protein has been characterized as a cysteine protease, because its activity is abrogated by mutation of the critical His and Cys residues of the conserved catalytic domain and is inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents. Taking into account the above findings, the ASFV protease can be included in the same group of cysteine proteases as the SUMO-1-specific proteases and the protease from adenovirus. All of these proteins are characterized by the presence of unrelated N-terminal extensions of variable lengths, which most likely account for the specificity of the substrate. In relation to this, it is worth noting that the ASFV protease is the only enzyme of this group that processes polyprotein precursors recognizing several Gly-Gly-Xaa sites in the substrate sequence. Interestingly, during ASFV infection, this processing occurs through an ordered cascade of proteolytic cleavages, which may depend on conformational changes in the intermediate products or on interaction with other proteins during virus morphogenesis (6Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Viñuela E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2977-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Simón-Mateo C. Andrés G. Almazán F. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5799-5804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of the viral protease will help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the cascade processing of the viral polyproteins. It is also possible that the viral enzyme might be able to cleave cellular or viral ubiquitin-like modified proteins. This is an interesting possibility that may provide insight into the structural and functional aspects of this emerging family of cysteine proteases. The studies on the expression and localization of protein pS273R in cells infected with ASFV further support a role for this protein in the processing of the viral polyproteins during the virus morphogenesis. Thus, protein pS273R, as its polyprotein substrates, is synthesized at late times of infection and is localized within the cytoplasmic viral factories where morphogenesis occurs. We have previously shown that the mature proteins p150, p37, p34, and p14, products of polyprotein pp220, are major components of the core shell, representing about 25% of the total protein mass of the virus particle (8Andrés G. Simón-Mateo C. Viñuela E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same location has been found for the structural proteins p35 and p15, which are derived from polyprotein pp62.2 These findings, together with the observed localization of protein pS273R in the virus morphogenetic intermediates, suggest a role for the ASFV protease in the assembly of the viral core. Thus, proteolytic processing might be an essential mechanism for the spatio-temporal control of the interactions between core components, in such a way that only preassembled and properly processed substrates could enter the assembly pathway. In connection with this, it should be mentioned that other complex DNA-containing viruses, such as adenoviruses and poxviruses, use proteolytic processing at similar or identical cleavage sequences for the maturation of major core proteins. In the case of poxviruses, the cleavage of core precursors is crucial for the formation of virus particles, which does not take place if the processing is blocked (36Moss B. Rosenblum E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 81: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, the adenovirus protease acts in newly assembled virions, being needed for their maturation into infectious virions (37Weber J. J. Virol. 1976; 17: 462-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that processing of the viral precursor proteins takes place only after virion assembly, this enzyme employs a unique and complex regulatory mechanism, involving stimulation of its activity by peptide and DNA cofactors (13Webster A. Hay R.T. Kemp G. Cell. 1993; 72: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Mangel W.F. Toledo D.L. Brown M.T. Martin J.H. McGrath W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 536-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to ascertain whether similar mechanisms operate to control the temporal and spatial activity of the ASFV protease. As has also been described for the adenovirus protease and the I7 protein of poxviruses (38Anderson C.W.,. Virology. 1990; 177: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Kane E.M. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2689-2698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ASFV protein pS273R is present in the core of mature virus particles. This finding could merely reflect a residual presence of an enzymatic activity needed during the final steps of ASFV morphogenesis. Another possibility is that protein pS273R is involved in some early event of viral infection. This is the case for the adenovirus protease that has been implicated in virus entry into the host cell and disassembly of the incoming virus particles (40Cotten M. Weber J.M. Virology. 1995; 213: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,41Greber U.F. Webster P. Weber J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1766-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Whether the ASFV protease, besides a morphogenetic role late in the virus replicative cycle, might also cleave other viral or even cellular substrates early in infection is a question that remains to be addressed.

Although studies using lymphoblasts from Niemann-Pick disease patients or acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase)-deficient mice have provided genetic support for this hypothesis, these models have not been universally accepted as definitive. Here, we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from asmase mice manifest cell autonomous defects in apoptosis in response to several stresses. In particular, asmase −/−MEFs failed to generate ceramide and were totally resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis but remained sensitive to staurosporine, which did not induce ceramide.asmase −/− MEFs were also partially resistant to tumor necrosis factor α/ actinomycin D and serum withdrawal. Thus, resistance to apoptosis in asmase −/− MEFs was not global but rather stress type specific. Most importantly, the sensitivity to stress could be restored in the asmase −/− MEFs by administration of natural ceramide. Overcoming apoptosis resistance by natural ceramide is evidence that it is the lack of ceramide, not ASMase, that determines apoptosis sensitivity. The ability to rescue the apoptotic phenotype without reversing the genotype by the product of the enzymatic deficiency provides proof that ceramide is obligate for apoptosis induction in response to some stresses.

Ceramide is the central molecule in this pathway, generated from SM by the action of a neutral sphingomyelinase or acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) or by de novo synthesis coordinated through the enzyme ceramide synthase. Ceramide has been implicated as second messenger for cytokines signaling through the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and for diverse stresses (e.g. ionizing radiation, oxidative stress, ultraviolet C, and heat). Although in some cells ceramide may provide proliferative or differentiating signals, often the outcome of ceramide signaling is the induction of apoptosis. Evidence that ceramide is involved directly in the induction of apoptosis is summarized as follows: (i) agonist-induced ceramide elevations precede biochemical and morphological manifestations of apoptosis (4Tepper A.D.

Lymphoblasts from Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) patients, which have an inherited deficiency of ASMase activity, failed to respond to ionizing radiation with ceramide generation or apoptosis (22Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.

These abnormalities were, however, reversed by transduction of the human asmase cDNA. Furthermore, asmase knockout mice also manifested defects in radiation-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis in endothelium of the lung and throughout the central nervous system (22Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar). asmase knockout mice were, however, normally sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis in thymic cells. In contrast, p53 knockout mice were largely insensitive in the thymus but were not resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis in endothelium. Since these original findings, other reports have confirmed that the Niemann-Pick cells are resistant to ionizing radiation (23Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Zundel W. Swiersz L.M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Whether the ASMase-deficient systems are resistant to Fas-/APO-1-/CD95-induced death has been a matter of debate. Testi and coworkers (26Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) claimed the Niemann-Pick cells manifested resistance to Fas-induced death, whereas Borst and coworkers (27Cock J.G. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7560-7565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) found no differences. Recently, Green and coworkers (28Lin T. Genestier L. Pinkoski M.J. Castro A. Nicholas S. Mogil R. Paris F. Fuks Z. Schuchman E.H. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8657-8663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reported partial resistance to Jo2 anti-Fas-induced liver failure and death in asmase knockout mice in vivo. These genetic models have not uniformly been accepted as definitive. The NPD lymphoblasts described above were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus, and the transformation process itself, as well as known Epstein-Barr virus strain-specific phenotypic differences (29Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Longnecker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Miller C.L. Burkhardt A.L. Lee J.H. Stealey B. Longnecker R. Bolen J.B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9489-9495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), might have played an unknown role in the radiation resistance. Furthermore, the potential for a direct contribution of the mutated ASMase protein to the radiation resistance phenotype has not been assessed. Additionally, it remains possible that the resistance of endothelium to radiation-induced apoptotic death in vivo is not a cell autonomous defect but rather reflects a systemic process. To address these issues directly, we have generated murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from the asmase knockout mice. We observe complete resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in these cells, partial resistance to serum withdrawal or TNFα/ actinomycin D (ActD) treatment, yet complete sensitivity to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, sensitivity to radiation-, serum withdrawal-, and TNFα/ActD-induced death could be restored by pretreatment with minute amounts of natural ceramide. Rescuing the apoptotic phenotype without reversing the genotype by the product of the enzymatic deficiency indicates that ceramide is obligate, in particular for radiation, for apoptotic death. Actinomycin D, Hoechst-33258, and staurosporine were from Sigma. Recombinant mouse TNFα was from Pharmingen. The fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC was purchased from Kamiya Biomedical Co. Anti-phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase and anti-phospho-p38 antibodies were from New England Biolabs, whereas the anti-phospho c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) antibody was from Promega. The anti-TNF receptor (TNFR) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals. LK6D Silica Gel 60A TLC plates were from Whatman. C16-ceramide and C16-dihydroceramide were from Biomol. MEFs derived from asmase +/+ and asmase −/− day 12–13 embryos were prepared as described (32Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured every 3 days for a maximum of six passages. Only MEFs from passages 2–5 were used for experiments. 0.05–0.1 × 106 cells were seeded per 60-mm plate and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were made quiescent by 12-h incubation in 0.5% FBS and then either irradiated using a 137Cs Shepherd Mark-I irradiator or treated with different inducers of apoptosis, as stated in the figure legends. For ceramide rescue, cells were pretreated for 30 min with C16-ceramide or C16-dihydroceramide in dodecane:ethanol (2:98, v/v; 0.05% final concentration). Total cellular lipids were extracted as described previously (13Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). To measure SM mass, equal aliquots of each sample were spotted on TLC plates, and SM was resolved using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:30:8:3, v/v/v/v) as solvent. After chromatography, plates were sprayed with 35% (v/v) sulfuric acid, and lipids were charred by heating in an oven at 180 °C for 30 min and quantified by comparison with a concomitantly run standard curve composed on known quantities of SM. Ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol kinase assay as described previously (33Bose R. Chen P. Loconti A. Grullich C. Abrams J.M. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28852-28859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ASMase and neutral sphingomyelinase activities were measured as described by Lin et al. (34Lin X. Hengartner M.O. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14374-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At different times after treatment, cells were processed for nuclear staining as described (35Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium containing the floating dead cells was aspirated and pooled together with a PBS wash of the monolayer in a 15-ml Falcon conical tube. The remaining adherent cells were trypsinized, collected in the same tube, and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The pellets were gently vortexed and fixed in 400 μl of 10% buffered formalin phosphate for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclear apoptosis was assessed by staining of formalin-fixed cells with the DNA binding fluorochrome Hoechst-33258 as described (13Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). A minimum of 200 cells were scored at each point. The fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC was used to measure caspase 3 activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate plus 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), and the protein concentration was measured. 20 μg of cell lysate were mixed with 8 μm Ac-DEVD-AFC in 200 μl of caspase 3 buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) in a 96-well plate. Fluorescence generated by the release of the fluorogenic group AFC on cleavage by caspase 3 was measured in a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer by excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm. Mitogen-activated protein kinase, JNK, and p38 activation were detected by Western blot with anti-phospho-specific antibodies. After 12 h in 0.5% FBS, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, or 100 ng/ml TNFα for 10 min, washed with PBS, and lysed in 0.2 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Western blots were performed as described (36Xing H.R. Lozano J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17276-17280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ASMase-deficient cells displayed cell autonomous defects in apoptosis, we generated MEFs from wild-type and ASMase-deficient mice. No measurable ASMase activity was detected in the asmase −/− MEFs (TableI), whereas neutral sphingomyelinase activity was unchanged. As a consequence of the ASMase deficiency,asmase −/− MEFs manifested a modest 20% increase in the SM content and a 12% decrease in ceramide levels (Table I). Both wild-type and knockout MEFs grew at similar rates (Table I) and manifested identical morphology (data not shown). The content and distribution of caveolin-1, the primary protein within the sphingolipid-rich microdomains termed caveolae, were similar in asmase +/+ and asmase −/− MEFs (37Lozano, J., Morales, A., Cremesti, A., Fuks, Z., Tilly, J. L., Schuchman, E., Gulbins, E., and Kolesnick, R. (2000) Cell Death Differ., in pressGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, the proportion of detergent-insoluble caveolar membranes isolated and the signaling components found within these membranes appeared similar in asmase +/+ and asmase −/− MEFs (37Lozano, J., Morales, A., Cremesti, A., Fuks, Z., Tilly, J. L., Schuchman, E., Gulbins, E., and Kolesnick, R. (2000) Cell Death Differ., in pressGoogle Scholar). Activation of p38, c-Jun N-terminal, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases in response to platelet-derived growth factor, TNFα, and epidermal growth factor were also identical in asmase +/+ and asmase −/− MEFs (see Table I and Fig. 3 B). Thus, by numerous criteria,asmase +/+ and asmase −/− MEFs appeared similar.Table IComparison of asmase+/+ and asmase−/− MEFsasmase+/+asmase−/−Biochemical properties1-a−, not detected; +, optimal detection of an event.

A 12-h quiescence period was selected to minimize the basal level of apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal, which under these conditions was typically in the range of 4–5%. Fig.1 A, left panel, shows that exposure of asmase +/+ cells to a dose of 20 Gy resulted in time-dependent apoptosis, as measured by bisbenzimide staining. Apoptosis was apparent by 3 h and maximal 12 h after irradiation, when 25–30% of the population manifested chromatin condensation or nuclear segmentation, or both, morphologic characteristics of apoptotic cells. In contrast,asmase −/− cells were resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1 A) for as long as 72 h (data not shown). To determine whether a higher radiation dose might induce apoptosis in the asmase −/−cells, we treated the wild-type and knockout cells with increasing radiation doses and measured apoptosis after 24 h (Fig. 1 A, right panel). As little as 1 Gy increased apoptosis to 13% of the asmase +/+ population, and a maximal effect was obtained with a 20-Gy dose. Quantitatively similar results were reported by Santana et al. (22Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.

In contrast, asmase −/− MEFs were resistant to radiation up to 30 Gy. To confirm the results of Fig. 1 A using a biochemical assay, caspase 3 activity was measured in both asmase +/+ and asmase −/− MEFs at various times after irradiation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, we detected a 2.8 ± 0.1-fold increase in caspase activity at 6 h after 20 Gy irradiation (p < 0.001 versus zero time control) in asmase +/+ MEFs and a maximal 3.4 ± 0.1-fold increase at 10 h. In agreement with the results shown in Fig. 1 A, we could not detect any increase in caspase 3 activity in the asmase −/− MEFs at any time point. These results show that lack of ASMase renders cells resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis. To confirm that ASMase deficiency resulted in resistance to ceramide generation, ceramide levels were measured after irradiation of asmase +/+ and asmase −/− MEFs. In asmase +/+ cells, the ceramide content increased 1.5-fold by 15 min after 20 Gy irradiation (Fig. 1 C;p < 0.05) and returned to baseline within 1 h. In contrast, no ceramide elevation was observed in the asmase −/− MEFs under the same conditions (Fig. 1 C) at any time point up to 4 h. These data indicate that, as in NPD cells, lack of ASMase renders MEFs resistant to radiation-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis. Although these studies are consistent with a role for ceramide accumulation in the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation, they do not constitute proof that the apoptosis resistance resulted from lack of ceramide production. To evaluate whether the mutation leading to the asmase−/− phenotype resulted in a universal inactivation of the apoptotic apparatus, MEFs were exposed to another type of proapoptotic stress.

A family of ETO proteins has recently been described that share homology with the Drosophila gene nervy, and although the function of ETO is not well defined, ETO was recently shown to recruit corepressor molecules (4Lutterbach B.

The most prominent functional consequence of the AML1/ETO fusion is the conversion of AML1 from a context-dependent transcriptional activator into a transcriptional repressor (by its fusion with ETO). The mechanism of repression by AML1/ETO is believed to be the recruitment of corepressor complexes via interactions of mSin3 and N-CoR with the ETO portion of the fusion protein. Nonetheless, transcriptional repression by AML1 and activation by AML1/ETO have been reported (6Lutterbach B. Hou Y. Durst K.L. Hiebert S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4055-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that AML1/ETO can block differentiation of hematopoietic cells in response to several different stimuli (including granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor and the combination of vitamin D3 and TGF-β (5Gelmetti V.

Based on this observation, and considering the critical role of TGF-β in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation of both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells, we examined whether proteins involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway can interact with AML1 and/or AML1/ETO.Smad proteins have been identified as central mediators of TGF-β1 signaling (for a review, see Refs. 12Massagué J.

Activation of TGF-β1 receptors results in phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Smad2 and Smad3, which form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus, where they participate in the regulation of TGF-β1-inducible target genes recognizing the sequence CAGAC (which is the Smad binding motif). Activation of gene expression by Smads may require interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding nuclear proteins, including FAST1 (14Zhou S. Zawel L. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol.

These interactions play a critical role in TGF-β1 signaling, as binding of Smad-interacting proteins to their consensus DNA binding sites enhances Smad-specific transcriptional regulation (27Derynck R.

The possibility that AML1-related proteins could cooperate with TGF-β1 signaling was previously suggested (28Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar, 29Xie X.Q. Pardali E. Holm M. Sideras P. Grundstrom T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The t(3;21) fusion product, AML1/EVI-1, was shown to interact with Smad3 and was proposed to interfere with TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition of myeloid cells via the EVI-1 portion of the protein (30Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, recent reports indicate that AML1 proteins can form complexes with a variety of Smad proteins (including those involved in bone morphogenetic protein or activin signaling) (31Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M. Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ito Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16979-16985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).We identified a region of homology between the Smad interacting domain in FAST1 and FAST2 and the N-terminal portion of AML1 (amino acids 62 to 110), which is retained in the AML1/ETO chimeric protein. Although this region does not include the recently described Smad interacting motif (24Germain S. Howell M. Esslemont G.M. Hill C.S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 435-451PubMed Google Scholar), the homology is similar to that found in other Smad binding factors. We hypothesized that AML1/ETO could interact with Smads, and we have defined this interaction and characterized its effects on the response to TGF-β1.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe first determined whether AML1A, a short isoform of AML1 (amino acids 1–250) that contains the region of homology with FAST1, can interact with Smads, by transiently overexpressing Flag-tagged Smads alone or with AML1A in COS-1 cells and performing immunoprecipitations using anti-Flag antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, AML1A interacted with Smad3, and the interaction was observed in both the presence and absence of TGF-β1. Although in some experiments, including the one shown here, the interaction was increased by TGF-β1 stimulation, this was not uniformly observed. Overexpression of AML1/ETO or AML1B (the larger 479-amino acid isoform of AML1) with Flag-tagged Smad3, followed by immunoprecipitation with the Flag antibody, demonstrated the interaction between both of these proteins and Smad3. These interactions were seen in both the presence and absence of TGF-β1 stimulation and usually (as shown for AML1A in Fig. 1 C and AML1/ETO in Fig. 1 D) but not always (AML1B in Fig. 1 D), this interaction was increased by TGF-β1. Similar variability in TGF-β1 inducibility of AML-Smad interactions was noted by Pardali et al. (32Pardali E. Xie X.Q. Tsapogas P. Itoh S. Arvanitidis K. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Grundstrom T. Sideras P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3552-3560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we demonstrated that other Smad family members (including Smad2 and Smad4) also interact with AML1 proteins (data not shown), similar to that recently reported for AML2 (by Hanai et al. (31Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M. Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31577-31582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)).These results suggest that the Smad interacting domain in AML1 proteins is localized to its N terminus, as neither AML1A nor AML1/ETO contains the C-terminal portion of AML1B. To more precisely map the region of interaction, we used in vitro “GST-pulldown” assays with35S-labeled in vitro translated Smad3 and a variety of bacterially expressed GST-AML1 protein constructs (Fig. 2 A) (34Mao S. Frank R.C. Zhang J. Miyazaki Y. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the GST-AML1 and GST-RHD fusion proteins clearly bind35S-labeled Smad3, whereas neither GST alone nor the very N-terminal portion of AML1 (GST-A1Bsx200) bind 35S-labeled Smad3. Very weak binding of the N-terminal region of the RHD (GST-A1B-(88–119)), as well as the C-terminal fragment of AML1B to Smad3 was seen, providing some additional localizing data. To further define the role of the runt homology domain (RHD) in the interaction between AML1/ETO and Smad3 we used in vitrotranscribed and translated forms of AML1/ETO and AML1B (Fig. 2 C) and full-length GST-Smad3. As shown in Fig. 2 D, full-length AML1/ETO interacted with Smad3, although this interaction is weaker than the interaction of AML1B with Smad3. Deletion of the middle third of the RHD from AML1/ETO (or from AML1B) eliminated their interaction with Smad3; this region partially overlaps with the region in AML1 that shares homology with FAST1. In contrast, deletion of the Ets interacting domain (ΔEID), which is located at the C terminus of the RHD (34Mao S. Frank R.C. Zhang J. Miyazaki Y. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), had much less effect on the ability of AML1/ETO or AML1B to associate with Smad3. These findings suggest that the more N-terminal portion of the AML1 RHD plays a critical role in the interaction of AML1 proteins with Smad3. The stronger interaction of Smad3 with AML1B than with AML1/ETO could reflect the loss of a second Smad interacting domain, which has been found at the C terminus of AML1B (32Pardali E. Xie X.Q. Tsapogas P. Itoh S. Arvanitidis K. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Grundstrom T. Sideras P. J. Biol.

In the absence of TGF-β1, endogenous Smad2 (Fig. 3) and Smad3 (data not shown) are found predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas AML1 is found in the nucleus. TGF-β1 stimulation resulted in the translocation of Smads to the nucleus and their colocalization with AML1. The same pattern of immunofluorescence staining was obtained using the anti-ETO antibody indicating colocalization of AML1/ETO and/or ETO with Smad2 or Smad3. This result suggests that the physiologic association of AML1 proteins and Smads is TGF-β1-inducible; it contrasts with the cytoplasmic AML1B-Smad3 complexes detected by Pardali et al. (32Pardali E.

It is possible that receptor activation, which leads to the association of Smad4 with regulatory Smads (R-Smads), strengthens the protein-protein interactions involving R-Smads by incorporating Smad4 into a multiprotein complex.Figure 3Localization of the endogenous Smad, AML1, ETO, and AML1/ETO proteins in Kasumi-1 cells.

Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6751-6760PubMed Google Scholar, 29Xie X.Q. Pardali E. Holm M. Sideras P. Grundstrom T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We performed transient transfection experiments and observed clearly divergent effects of AML1B and AML1/ETO on the promoter activity, as shown in Fig. 4 A. AML1B alone and TGF-β1 both exerted a stimulatory effect on promoter activity, whereas AML1/ETO blocked the effects of TGF-β1 and repressed basal promoter function. Whereas AML1A was shown to activate the Iα1 promoter in DG75 B cells (29Xie X.Q. Pardali E. Holm M. Sideras P. Grundstrom T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), AML1A (alone or with TGF-β1) weakly suppressed promoter activity in COS cells, perhaps due to its ability to bind to the AML1 consensus binding site but lack of the C-terminal AML1B transactivation domain. Similarly, when Smad3 was overexpressed together with one of the AML1 proteins, AML1B cooperated with Smad3 and AML1/ETO suppressed promoter activity (Fig. 4 B). The inhibitory effect of AML1/ETO is dependent on the presence of the RHD, as the AML1/ETO deletion mutants that lack the middle portion of the RHD have no inhibitory effect on the promoter activity (Fig. 4 C). Removal of the C-terminal 174 amino acids from AML1/ETO decreased inhibition to a level similar to that seen with AML1A. Together, these results demonstrate that AML1/ETO inhibits Smad signaling and that inhibition requires the presence of both the RHD and the C-terminal domains in the chimeric protein.We have demonstrated that the RHD portion of the AML1 protein, which is retained in AML1/ETO, plays a critical role in both its physical association and functional interaction with Smad signaling pathway. This stands in contrast to a recently published report, which indicated that the Smad interacting domain in AML2, a protein quite similar to AML1, maps to the C-terminal portion of the protein (31Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Fukuchi M. Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ito Y. J. Biol.

Whether these reported differences result from different methodologies, e.g.comparing in vivo versus in vitrointeractions, or relate to differences between the AML1 and AML2 proteins, particularly at their C-terminal portions, remains to be determined. It is possible that the presence of other interacting proteins may affect in vivo interactions between AML proteins and Smads and provide an explanation for at least some of the differences.AML1B and AML1/ETO differentially regulate target gene activity, with AML1B exerting a stimulatory effect on basal and TGF-β1-stimulated Igα activity and AML1/ETO repressing basal promoter activity and blocking the response to TGF-β1. The different functional effects of the interaction of AML1B and AML1/ETO with Smad proteins is potentially very important in view of the known critical role of TGF-β1 in hematopoiesis as the regulator of the balance between proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The activation of target genes by TGF-β1 is highly dependent on the presence or absence of different Smad interacting partners and the regulatory DNA context. Disruption of TGF-β1 signaling by either Smad mutations or functional inactivation of Smads has been associated with malignant transformation of a number of solid tumor malignancies, including colon (36Miyaki M.

Our demonstration that AML1/ETO can functionally inactivate the TGF-β1/Smad signaling may provide the basis for some of the malignant features of t(8;21) leukemia. TGF-β1 signaling is apparently impaired by other fusion proteins, such as EWS/FLI-1, which is found in Ewing's sarcoma and AML1/EVI-1 (39Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Imai Y. Ogawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1998; 92: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is formed as a result of the t(3;21) translocation. EWS/FLI-1 decreases the expression of TGF-β1 receptor type II (40Im Y.H. Kim H.T. Lee C. Poulin D. Welford S. Sorensen P.H. Denny C.T. Kim S.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1536-1540PubMed Google Scholar). The AML1/EVI-1 and AML1/MDS/EVI-1 proteins were previously shown to inhibit the effect of TGF-β1 on a TGF-β1-responsive reporter plasmid, 3TP-Lux, which contains AP-1 and Smad binding sites; these fusions also block the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 on hematopoietic cells (39Kurokawa M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2994-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) were shown to interact with CREB-binding protein/p300. Because AML1 interacts with coactivators via its C-terminal portion, which is lost in AML1/ETO, the chimeric protein not only loses its ability to interact with coactivators but acquires an additional ability to recruit corepressors via its ETO partner (4Lutterbach B.

Our results indicate that the C-terminal portion of AML1/ETO plays a role in the repression of the transactivation of the promoter activity by TGF-β1, as deletion of this region from AML1/ETO, which can interact with N-CoR and mSin3, decreases its inhibitory effects. Although AML1B itself can recruit corepressor molecules, its interaction with TGF-β1 signaling is a positive or cooperative one (45Lutterbach B. Westendorf J.J. Linggi B. Isaac S. Seto E. Hiebert S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 651-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Smads can also participate, either directly or indirectly, in the recruitment of corepressors (46Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massagué J.

The t(8;21) is the most frequent chromosomal translocation inde novo acute myelogenous leukemia, and it joins the AML11 gene on chromosome 21 to the ETO gene on chromosome 8, resulting in the formation of an AML1/ETO chimeric transcription factor. AML1 is a member of therunt family of transcription factors, and gene disruption experiments in mice have shown that AML1 is critical for the development of definitive (fetal liver) hematopoiesis (1Okuda T. van Deursen J.

LPS is thought to be a major cause of the widespread cellular activation observed in patients with Gram-negative septic shock. The lipid A portion of LPS consists of a backbone of two phosphorylated glucosamine molecules acylated with fatty acids and contains the pro-inflammatory toxicity associated with LPS (1Raetz C.R.

Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 93-114Google Scholar). LPS activation of mammalian cells is mediated by its interaction with membrane CD14, a 55-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein primarily expressed on phagocytes (3Wright S.D.

In addition to the membrane-bound receptors, blood contains several factors, including soluble CD14 (sCD14) (16Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J.

Third, TLR4 is responsible for the fine discriminatory ability of the LPS receptor. For example, the unique species-specific pharmacology associated with small alterations in lipid A structure can be attributed to differences in the primary structure of TLR4 (23Lien E. Means T.K.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), although it is possible that TLR2 represents an LPS receptor involved in the recognition of non-enteric endotoxins.An important approach to understanding how any receptor system functions is to define its pharmacology. Partial lipid A structures have been important in investigating mechanisms of LPS binding and cell activation (36Lynn W.A. Golenbock D.T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).

One advantage of the synthetic compounds is that they are less likely to be contaminated with minor, but potent, bacterial products that may mislead the investigator, as has been an occasional confounding problem with LPS (35Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 43Manthey C.L. Perera P.Y. Henricson B.E. Hamilton T.A. Qureshi N. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2653-2663PubMed Google Scholar).In an attempt to dissect further the LPS-signaling pathway, we utilized a newly developed lipid A agonist, compound ER-112022. This compound is a symmetric phospholipid dimer connected by a noncarbohydrate backbone. We observed that under serum-free conditions, ER-112022 was able to stimulate cells lacking membrane CD14. Furthermore, ER-112022 appeared to mediate stimulatory effects through the TLR4 and MD-2 pathway. We suggest that ER-112022 interacts directly with the LPS-signaling receptor, obviating the need for CD14.DISCUSSIONThe signaling events leading to the activation of cells by LPS are not fully understood, although recent reports strongly implicate TLR4 and MD-2 as CD14-associated signaling components of an LPS receptor complex. CD14 is the best characterized portion of the LPS receptor, having been shown to actually bind LPS. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the GPI-anchored CD14 is not an actual signal transducer and that it does not account for the specificity of biological responses to endotoxins. When dissecting the mechanisms of signaling in the LPS receptor system, the use of both agonists as well as antagonists may help increase the understanding of the complex interactions between ligands and receptor molecules. Whereas neither pharmacological nor molecular genetic approaches can replace biophysical and biochemical analysis of receptor function, both approaches can add substantially to our understanding of receptor mechanisms.In this study, we describe ER-112022, a unique new acyclic and symmetrical LPS mimetic. ER-112022 activates cells through the LPS-signaling pathway via TLR4 and MD-2 but does not require membrane or soluble CD14. This observation suggests that the role of CD14 in LPS signaling may be limited to the simple transfer of LPS to TLRs and may not involve the formation of a ternary complex involving TLR4/MD-2 and CD14. The symmetrical organization of ER-112022 further suggests that compounds of the correct size, shape, and hydrophobicity may cross-link transmembrane signaling molecules, perhaps resulting in the formation of a TLR4 homodimer, and thus the initiation of a proinflammatory signal.A great deal of effort has been focused on the role of LPS receptor cofactors present as soluble molecules in blood that augment the potency of LPS in vitro and to a lesser (but important) extent in vivo (51Wurfel M.M.

The data presented in this work suggest a series of events that begin with LPS binding to serum LPS-enhancing proteins that alter the conformation of the LPS molecule itself. Transfer of LPS from soluble mediators like LBP and sCD14 to membrane CD14, as well as transfer of LPS from membrane CD14 to TLR4, presumably occurs because of slight alterations in LPS conformation that facilitate Toll receptor binding. ER-112022 seems to have a structural conformation that enables it to bypass all of these LPS-facilitating proteins in binding to TLRs and thus to interact directly with the LPS signal transducer. The structural basis of this remarkable physical property, when elucidated, should shed light on the nature of the microenvironment of the putative LPS-binding pocket on TLR4.The essential components necessary for activation of the LPS-signaling pathway are present in both nonmyeloid and myeloid cells, and the data to date suggest that in vitro work involving transfection of nonmyeloid cells with genes encoding LPS receptors can be highly informative about the nature of phagocyte LPS receptors. The unique structure of the novel acyclic LPS-like agonist ER-112022 allows the compound to interact directly with this pathway in a CD14-independent manner. ER-112022 and derivatives may directly bind to the TLR4-MD-2 complex. Because of its defined synthetic basis, as well as its independence from CD14 and LBP, ER-112022 should be useful for simplifying both the binding and co-crystallization studies with TLR4 that will be necessary for identifying the region or regions of TLR4 that directly contact endotoxin. Hence, these studies may help to design specific drugs for endotoxin-related diseases, including Gram-negative bacterial septic shock. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS,1 endotoxin) is the major constituent of the outer envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS is thought to be a major cause of the widespread cellular activation observed in patients with Gram-negative septic shock. The lipid A portion of LPS consists of a backbone of two phosphorylated glucosamine molecules acylated with fatty acids and contains the pro-inflammatory toxicity associated with LPS (1Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 2Zähringer U. Lindner B. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 93-114Google Scholar). LPS activation of mammalian cells is mediated by its interaction with membrane CD14, a 55-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein primarily expressed on phagocytes (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar, 4Ziegler Heitbrock H.W. Ulevitch R.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). CD14 appears to be the highest affinity receptor for LPS, but other LPS-binding molecules involved in proinflammatory responses by phagocytic leukocytes have been described, such as the β2 integrin family members CD11/CD18 (5Ingalls R.R. Arnaout M.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 433-438PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither CD14, which does not have a trans-membrane domain (6Haziot A. Chen S. Ferrero E. Low M.G. Silber R. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 547-552PubMed Google Scholar, 7Goyert S.M. Ferrero E. Rettig W.J. Yenamandra A.K. Obata F. Le Beau M.M.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 433-438PubMed Google Scholar) appear to transduce a signal directly. Members of the family of Toll-like receptors (TLR), especially TLR4, have recently been suggested as LPS signal transducers (9Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill A.T. Rothe M. J. Exp.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). In addition, a small protein, known as MD-2, enhances the ability of LPS to activate cells via TLR4 (13Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar) and appears to be a part of a TLR4 complex (14Yang H. Young D.W. Gusovsky F. Chow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20861-20866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The Toll family member RP105 may also associate with TLR4 and mediate LPS responsiveness in B cells (15Ogata H. Su I. Miyake K. Nagai Y. Akashi S. Mecklenbrauker I. Rajewsky K. Kimoto M. Tarakhovsky A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition to the membrane-bound receptors, blood contains several factors, including soluble CD14 (sCD14) (16Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and LPS-binding protein (LBP) (17Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar), that are important modulators of LPS activity. Several lines of evidence suggest that TLR4 is the main signal-transducing molecule in the LPS receptor complex. First, animals that lack a functional TLR4, but not those without a functional TLR2, are markedly hyporesponsive to LPS (11Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6382) Google Scholar, 18Qureshi S.T. Larivi Leveque G.

Second, LPS induces activation of HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4 cDNA, and this activation is blocked by a lipid A-based LPS antagonist (12Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Third, TLR4 is responsible for the fine discriminatory ability of the LPS receptor. For example, the unique species-specific pharmacology associated with small alterations in lipid A structure can be attributed to differences in the primary structure of TLR4 (23Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin.

In contrast, TLR2 appears to be involved in responses to a variety of bacterial compounds, such as bacterial lipoproteins, peptidoglycan, and lipoarabinomannan, as well as whole bacteria and yeast particles (21Lien E.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), although it is possible that TLR2 represents an LPS receptor involved in the recognition of non-enteric endotoxins. An important approach to understanding how any receptor system functions is to define its pharmacology. Partial lipid A structures have been important in investigating mechanisms of LPS binding and cell activation (36Lynn W.A. Golenbock D.T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These compounds include several naturally occurring, bacterially derived LPS antagonists such as deacylated LPS, lipid IVa, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A (37Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J.

One advantage of the synthetic compounds is that they are less likely to be contaminated with minor, but potent, bacterial products that may mislead the investigator, as has been an occasional confounding problem with LPS (35Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 43Manthey C.L. Perera P.Y. Henricson B.E. Hamilton T.A. Qureshi N. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2653-2663PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to dissect further the LPS-signaling pathway, we utilized a newly developed lipid A agonist, compound ER-112022. This compound is a symmetric phospholipid dimer connected by a noncarbohydrate backbone. We observed that under serum-free conditions, ER-112022 was able to stimulate cells lacking membrane CD14. Furthermore, ER-112022 appeared to mediate stimulatory effects through the TLR4 and MD-2 pathway. We suggest that ER-112022 interacts directly with the LPS-signaling receptor, obviating the need for CD14. DISCUSSIONThe signaling events leading to the activation of cells by LPS are not fully understood, although recent reports strongly implicate TLR4 and MD-2 as CD14-associated signaling components of an LPS receptor complex. CD14 is the best characterized portion of the LPS receptor, having been shown to actually bind LPS.

In addition, it has revealed a hydrogen bond network of potential catalytic importance not detected in other serine peptidases. This involves a unique intramolecular hydrogen bond between the P1′ amide and P2 carbonyl groups and another between the P2′ amide and Nε2 of the catalytic histidine 680 residue. It is argued that both hydrogen bonds promote proton transfer from the imidazolium ion to the leaving group. Another complex formed with the product-like inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-glycyl-proline, indicating that the carboxyl group of the inhibitor forms a hydrogen bond with the Nε2 of His680. Because a protonated histidine makes a stronger interaction with the carboxyl group, it offers a possibility of the determination of the real p Ka of the catalytic histidine residue. This was found to be 6.25, lower than that of the well studied serine proteases. The new titration method gave a single p Ka for prolyl oligopeptidase, whose reaction exhibited a complex pH dependence for kcat /Km , and indicated that the observed p Ka values are apparent.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 160-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It is presumably involved in the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides (1Wilk S. Life Sci. 1983; 33: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Prolyl oligopeptidase has recently gained pharmaceutical interest, because specific inhibitors reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats (4Yoshimoto T. Kado K. Matsubara F. Koriyama N. Kaneto H.

Cosyns P. Biol. Psychiatry. 1994; 35: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The enzyme also has a role in the regulation of blood pressure by participating in the renin-angiotensin system through metabolism of bradykinin and angiotensin I and II (8Welches W.R. Brosnihan K.B. Ferrario C.M. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 1461-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Prolyl oligopeptidase is unrelated to the well known trypsin and subtilisin families and belongs to a new class of serine peptidases (clan SC, family S9), which also includes dipeptidyl peptidase IV, acylaminoacyl peptidase, and oligopeptidase B (9Rawlings N.D. Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). These enzymes display distinct specificities, and each contains a peptidase domain at the carboxyl-terminal region of the single polypeptide chain. In the case of prolyl oligopeptidase, the active site serine and histidine have been identified as Ser554 and His680, respectively (11Rennex D. Hemmings B.A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Stone S.R. Rennex D. Wikstrom P. Shaw E. Hofsteenge J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A structural relationship between lipases and the peptidase domain of oligopeptidases has been indicated by the similar topology of the catalytic groups and by the homologous amino acid sequences around these residues (13Polgár L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The 1.4-Å resolution crystal structures of the enzyme and its complex with Z1-Pro-prolinal (Protein Data Bank codes 1qfm and 1qfs) have recently been determined (14Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The results show that the enzyme contains a peptidase domain with an α/β-hydrolase fold and that its catalytic triad (Ser554, Asp641, His680) is covered by the central tunnel of an unusual β-propeller, which operates as a gating filter for the active site by excluding large structured peptides (15Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Polgár L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of serine peptidases involves an acyl enzyme intermediate. Both the formation and the decomposition of the acyl enzyme proceed through the formation of a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate that is stabilized by the oxyanion binding site providing two hydrogen bonds to the oxyanion (16Polgár L. New Compr. Biochem. 1987; 16: 159-200Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Polgár L. Mechanisms of Protease Action. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 87-122Google Scholar). In the chymotrypsin-type enzymes the hydrogen bonds are contributed by the main chain NH groups of the catalytic Ser195 and the nearby Gly193. In the subtilisin-type enzymes the side chain amide of an asparagine replaces the main chain NH of Gly193. In prolyl oligopeptidase one of the hydrogen bonds is formed between the oxyanion and the main chain NH group of Asn555, adjacent to the catalytic serine, Ser554. The second hydrogen bond is unique among serine peptidases and provided by the OH group of Tyr473 (14Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Experiments with the Y473F variant of prolyl oligopeptidase have shown that the Tyr473 OH indeed markedly contributes to the transition state stabilization, but the effects are greatly dependent upon the substrate and pH (18Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Structure determination of the hemiacetal group of prolyl oligopeptidase formed with an aldehyde inhibitor, Z-Pro-prolinal, has revealed a limited region of the substrate binding site, involving the S1-S3 subsites (14Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To identify the ligand binding mode of a longer substrate, which possesses amino acid residues on both sides of the scissile bond, we prepared the inactive S554A variant. We also examined the binding of inhibitors to this variant, which allowed us to estimate the p Ka of the catalytic histidine (His680) and of tyrosine (Tyr473) at the oxyanion binding site. Prolyl oligopeptidase of porcine brain was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (18Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined at 280 nm (4Yoshimoto T. Kado K. Matsubara F. Koriyama N. Kaneto H. Tsuru D. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1987; 10: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The S554A mutation was performed with the two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure as described for the Y473F mutant (18Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for mutagenesis: 5′-AACGGAGGTgCAAATGGAGG-3′ and 3′-TTGCCTCCAcGTTTACCTCC-5′. The activity of prolyl oligopeptidase was determined fluorometrically with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (Bachem, Ltd.), using a Jasco FP 777 spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 nm (1.5 nm bandwidth) and 410 nm (5 nm bandwidth), respectively. The substrate with internally quenched fluorescence, Abz-Gly-Phe-Gly-Pro-Phe-Gly-Phe(NO2)-Ala-NH2, was prepared with solid phase synthesis, and its hydrolysis was followed similarly as in the case of Z-Gly-Pro-Nap, except that the excitation and emission wavelengths were 337 and 420 nm, respectively. The specificity rate constants (kcat /Km) were determined under first-order conditions, i.e. at substrate concentrations lower than Km . The first-order rate constant, calculated by nonlinear regression analysis, was divided by the total enzyme concentration to provide kcat /Km . The pH dependence of catalysis was measured in a four-component buffer composed of 25 mm glycine, 25 mm acetic acid, 25 mm Mes, and 75 mm Tris and which contained 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol (standard buffer). The buffer was titrated to the desired pH with HCl or NaOH, while the ionic strength remained fairly constant over a wide pH range. Small changes in the conductivity were adjusted by the addition of NaCl. After the reaction had been completed, the pH of each sample was determined and found to be practically identical with the starting value. Theoretical curves for bell-shaped pH rate profiles were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis, using the following equationk=k(limit)[1/(1+10pK1−pH+10pH−pK2)]Equation 1 and the GraFit software (19Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit , Version 4. Erythacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1998Google Scholar). In Equation 1 k stands for kcat/Km , and (limit) refers to the pH independent maximum rate constant.K1 and K2 are the dissociation constants of a catalytically competent base and acid, respectively. The pH rate profiles composed of two bell-shaped curves were fitted to the following equationk=k(limit)1[1/(1+10pK1−pH+10pH−pK2)]+Equation 2 k(limit)2[1/(1+10pK2−pH+10pH−pK3)]where k(limit)1 and k(limit)2 gave the limiting values of the rate constant for the low pH and high pH forms of the enzyme. The Ki values, the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, were calculated from the following equationki/k0=1/(1+I/Ki)Equation 3 where ki and k0 are pseudo first-order rate constants determined at substrate concentrations at least 10-fold less than Km in the presence and absence of inhibitor (I), respectively. The peptides with the S554A variant of prolyl oligopeptidase were co-crystallized using the conditions established for the wild type enzyme (14Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 70.7 Å, b = 99.7 Å,c = 110.7 Å for the octapeptide complex and a = 71.1 Å, b = 100.1 Å,c = 111.3 Å for the Z-Gly-Pro-OH complex. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on a MAR345 image plate detector at the beam line X11 (EMBL, Hamburg, Germany) using a 0.909-Å wavelength. Data were processed using the HKL suite of programs (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). Refinement of the structures were carried out by alternate cycles of X-PLOR (21Brünger A.T. X-PLOR , Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and manual refitting using O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1qfm). A bulk solvent correction allowed all measured data to be used. Water molecules were added to the atomic model at the positions of large positive peaks (>3.0ς) in the difference electron density, only at places where the resulting water molecule fell into an appropriate hydrogen bonding environment. Restrained isotropic temperature factor refinements were carried out for each individual atom. The final model contains all the 710 amino acid residues in both complexes, the bound peptides, and a large number of solvent (glycerol and water) molecules.

Open table in a new tab We have synthesized an internally quenched fluorogenic peptide, Abz-Gly-Phe-Gly-Pro-Phe-Gly-Phe(NO2)-Ala-NH2, which is to be cleaved between the Pro-Phe bond. Fig.1 A illustrates its binding to the S554A variant. The binding mode of P3-P1 residues (Phe-Gly-Pro) is very similar to that of Z-Pro-prolinal (Fig. 1 C) (14Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The P1 proline ring is stacked against the aromatic Trp595, whose indole nitrogen is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of the Phe residue at the P3 position. The carbonyl oxygen of the scissile bond is in the oxyanion binding site, forming hydrogen bonds to the main chain NH of Asn555 and the OH of Tyr473. Both carbonyl oxygens of glycines at the P2 and P4 positions are hydrogen-bonded to the same Nη1 atom of Arg643. Interestingly, there is no interaction between main chain NH groups of the P2-P4 residues and the enzyme molecule. The amino-terminal Abz does not bind to the protein; consequently the resulting electron density is not defined at this residue (Fig. 1 A). The P1′-P2′ (Phe-Gly) portion is bound close to the imidazolium ion of the active site histidine residue. In the ground state of the reaction, the Nε2 atom of His680 is poised to accept the proton from the OH of Ser554, with the simultaneous generation of the tetrahedral transition state. In the second step, which occurs during decomposition of the transition state, Nε2 of His680 is required to be at a hydrogen bond distance from the main chain NH of the P1′ phenylalanine to facilitate its protonation. The P1′-NH to His680-Nε2 distance in the present S554A structure is longer (3.84 Å) than a normal hydrogen bond. Of course, this distance should be shortened in the tetrahedral intermediate, in which the proton transfer takes place from the Nε2 of His680 to the P1′ NH group. Most interestingly, a further catalytic contribution seems to arise from the main chain NH of the P2′ glycine, which also forms a hydrogen bond with the Nε2 of His680, thereby promoting the proton transfer from the imidazolium ion to the substrate leaving group. This contribution may be regarded as a substrate-assisted catalysis. If Ala554 of the present mutant was converted back to Ser, the additional oxygen atom would be in a proper position to provide nucleophilic attack on the substrate carbonyl carbon while donating its proton to Nε2 of His680. The aromatic side chain of the Phe residue at the P1′ position adopted the most favorable conformation; it is projected back to the cavity to stack against the peptide bond of the P1 and P2 residues. The carboxyl-terminal P3′ and P4′ residues presumably did not bind to the enzyme and must be rather mobile, because they are not seen in the electron density map. Therefore it could be concluded that the enzyme binds no more than six residues (P4-P2′) even from a longer substrate. This is fairly consistent with kinetic investigations, indicating that extension of the substrate over the P3-P2′ region fails to enhance the kinetic specificity constant (3Cunningham D.F. O'Connor B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 160-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab An additional important feature of substrate binding concerns the P2 carbonyl oxygen, which forms two hydrogen bonds, one with Arg643 as already pointed out (15Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Polgár L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the other with the leaving group (NH of the P1′ residue). These hydrogen bonds appear to stabilize the substrate in the proper position for catalysis and explain an earlier observation that a sulfur atom in place of the P2 carbonyl oxygen makes the substrate practically unsuitable for hydrolysis (23Polgár L. Kollát E. Hollósi M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The sulfur substitution of the carbonyl group in the P2 position seems to induce a greater effect on catalysis than does such a substitution in the P1 position, where the carbonyl oxygen is directly involved in the peptide bond cleavage (23Polgár L. Kollát E. Hollósi M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An extensive network of hydrogen bonds (P2′-NH···His680-Nε2, P1′-NH···P2-CO···Arg643-Nη1···P4-CO) has not been observed with other serine peptidases. In summary, the unique intramolecular hydrogen bond (P1′-NH···P2-CO) can possibly help the general acid catalysis, i.e. the proton transfer from the imidazolium ion to the leaving group. It has previously been shown that the acyl product of Z-Gly-Pro-Nap, the classic substrate of prolyl oligopeptidase, is an inhibitor to the enzyme (18Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig.1 B illustrates that the binding mode of Z-Gly-Pro-OH greatly resembles the complex formed between prolyl oligopeptidase and the aldehyde inhibitor Z-Pro-prolinal (Fig. 1 C) (14Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Similarity to the P1-P3 residues of the octapeptide binding (Fig. 1 A) is also apparent, and the interactions are listed in Table II. One of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate ion of Z-Gly-Pro-OH is located in the oxyanion binding site, forming hydrogen bonds with the OH group of Tyr473 and the main chain NH of Asn555. The other oxygen atom is linked to the Nε2 of His680. The strength of this interaction obviously depends on the protonation state of the imidazole group, which can form a strong salt bridge only if it is protonated. This phenomenon offers a possibility to determine the p Ka of the imidazole group by titrating with the inhibitor, as discussed below. The simplest way of estimating the p Ka values of catalytically competent groups utilizes pH-kcat/Km profiles. For example, the pH dependence curves for the subtilisin and chymotrypsin reactions have revealed a p Ka of ∼7 for the catalytic histidine. Unlike the sigmoid or bell-shaped pH rate profiles observed with the classic serine peptidases, the pH dependence for prolyl oligopeptidase is more complicated. This has previously been shown with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (24Polgár L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15000-15005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and also demonstrated here with the octapeptide substrate. As seen in Fig.2 A, the data conform to a doubly bell-shaped curve, which arises from the modification of the usual bell-shaped curve by an additional ionization event involving a group with an apparent p Ka of ∼7 (p K2 in Table III). The resulting pH dependence is composed of two active enzyme species, which are illustrated by broken lines in Fig. 2 A. Both enzyme forms must bear the imidazole group as a base, because its protonated form is catalytically inactive; therefore the p K1 of ∼5 (Table III) could be assigned to His680. However, the p Ka values of both ∼5 and ∼7 can be regarded as apparent dissociation constants, which may be due to the presence of two enzyme forms of different activities. This is supported by the observation that the relative activities of the two forms may change with different substrates, leading to the alteration in p Ka values. 2L. Polgár, unpublished result. Similar effects on the p Ka values are also seen when the kinetic parameters are compared in the absence and presence of 0.5m NaCl (Table III). The possible structural differences between the two pH-dependent forms have also been detected by intrinsic fluorescence measurements, which clearly indicate that the low pH form is more unfolded (26Polgár L. Biochem. J. 1995; 315: 267-271Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Table IIIKinetic parameters for the reactions of prolyl oligopeptidase with the octapeptide substrateWithout NaClWith 0.5m NaClk(limit)1(μm−1s−1)0.9 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.2k(limit)2 (μm−1s−1)3.4 ± 0.16.7 ± 0.4p K15.0 ± 0.55.3 ± 0.1p K27.2 ± 0.17.4 ± 0.1p K39.0 ± 0.18.6 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab In an attempt to obtain a reliable p Ka for the catalytic imidazole of prolyl oligopeptidase, we made use of the interaction observed here between prolyl oligopeptidase and its inhibitor, Z-Gly-Pro-OH (Fig.1 B). To this end, the association constant, 1/Ki of the enzyme-inhibitor complex has been plotted against pH in Fig. 2 B. The binding strength between the enzyme and Z-Gly-Pro-OH greatly increases with decreasing pH, as the imidazole Nε2 becomes protonated and creates a stronger salt bridge with the inhibitor. The proline carboxyl group is fairly acidic (p Ka ∼2), which ensures that its ionized form remains unchanged over the experimentally available pH range. The data fit to the ionization of a group with p Ka of 6.25 ± 0.04, which can be assigned to His680. This approach of titrating the catalytic histidine may be of use for other serine peptidases. For example, streptogrisin A, which is structurally related to chymotrypsin, forms complexes with Ac-Pro-Ala-Pro-Phe-OH and Ac-Pro-Ala-Pro-Tyr-OH, so that their carboxylate ions are bonded to the catalytic histidine, if it is protonated (27James M.N.G. Sielecki A.R. Brayer G.D. Delbaere L.T.J. Bauer C.-A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 43-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is known that high salt concentration depresses electrostatic effects. Therefore it can be expected that addition of salt to the reaction mixture decreases the value of the association constant, provided that the contribution of the salt bridge is significant in the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. This has indeed been found, as shown in Fig. 2 B. Whereas the limiting value of the association constant is reduced from 226 ± 7 to 179 ± 7 μm−1s−1, the p Ka of His680 is not changed (6.22 ± 0.05). These results confirm that the kinetic p Ka values extracted from Fig. 2 A do not represent the His680ionization. Structure determination of the enzyme-substrate complex allows us to describe the stereochemical features of prolyl oligopeptidase in catalytic action. Because the binding of P3-P1 residues is very similar to that of the transition state inhibitor Z-Pro-prolinal, we can conclude that substrate binding to the enzyme favors the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate form. This involves a nucleophilic attack and a general base catalysis as the first elementary catalytic step. Decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate requires that the leaving group and the catalytic histidine approach each other. The general acid catalysis is probably promoted in a substrate-assisted manner, by the strong hydrogen bond formation between the P1′ amide and the P2 main chain oxygen atom. In agreement with earlier kinetic experiments, the structure determination has also revealed that substrate binding is restricted to the P3-P2′ region only. Unlike in the enzymes chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and papain, the main chain NH groups of P2-P4 residues of the substrate do not form a β-sheet with the enzyme. The pH dependence of the rate constant (kcat/Km) gave a complex curve and did not permit the determination of the p Ka of the catalytic histidine. The observed interaction between the product-like inhibitor Z-Gly-Pro-OH and prolyl oligopeptidase, however, allowed us to titrate the enzyme with the inhibitor by measuring the association constant as a function of pH. This resulted in a p Ka of 6.2, lower than that found for chymotrypsin and subtilisin. This titration method for p Ka determination could be employed for other peptidases."
https://openalex.org/W2051818687,"The capacity of adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) to penetrate into target cells depends on post-translational fatty-acylation by the acyltransferase CyaC, which can palmitoylate the conserved lysines 983 and 860 of ACT. Here, the in vivoacylating capacity of a set of mutated CyaC acyltransferases was characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analyses of the ACT product. Substitutions of the potentially catalytic serine 20 and histidine 33 residues ablated acylating activity of CyaC. Conservative replacements of alanine 140 by glycine (A140G) and valine (A140V) residues, however, affected selectivity of CyaC for the two acylation sites on ACT. Activation by the A140G variant of CyaC generated a mixture of bi- and monoacylated ACT molecules, modified either at both Lys-860 and Lys-983, or only at Lys-860, respectively. In contrast, the A140V CyaC produced a nearly 1:1 mixture of nonacylated pro-ACT with ACT monoacylated almost exclusively at Lys-983. The respective proportion of toxin molecules acylated at Lys-983 correlated well with the cell-invasive activity of both ACT mixtures, which was about half of that of ACT fully acylated on Lys-983 by intact CyaC. These results show that acylation of Lys-860 alone does not confer cell-invasive activity on ACT, whereas acylation of Lys-983 is necessary and sufficient. The capacity of adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) to penetrate into target cells depends on post-translational fatty-acylation by the acyltransferase CyaC, which can palmitoylate the conserved lysines 983 and 860 of ACT. Here, the in vivoacylating capacity of a set of mutated CyaC acyltransferases was characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analyses of the ACT product. Substitutions of the potentially catalytic serine 20 and histidine 33 residues ablated acylating activity of CyaC. Conservative replacements of alanine 140 by glycine (A140G) and valine (A140V) residues, however, affected selectivity of CyaC for the two acylation sites on ACT. Activation by the A140G variant of CyaC generated a mixture of bi- and monoacylated ACT molecules, modified either at both Lys-860 and Lys-983, or only at Lys-860, respectively. In contrast, the A140V CyaC produced a nearly 1:1 mixture of nonacylated pro-ACT with ACT monoacylated almost exclusively at Lys-983. The respective proportion of toxin molecules acylated at Lys-983 correlated well with the cell-invasive activity of both ACT mixtures, which was about half of that of ACT fully acylated on Lys-983 by intact CyaC. These results show that acylation of Lys-860 alone does not confer cell-invasive activity on ACT, whereas acylation of Lys-983 is necessary and sufficient.

ACT delivers into cells a catalytic adenylate cyclase domain (AC) that is activated by intracellular calmodulin and catalyzes unregulated conversion of ATP to cAMP (3Wolff J. Cook G.H.

In addition, ACT has the capacity to form small cation-selective membrane channels that account for its weak hemolytic activity (7Khelef N. Zychlinsky A. Guiso N. Infect.

The capacity of ACT to form hemolytic channels and to penetrate target cell membranes and deliver the AC domain (cell-invasive activity) depends on a covalent post-translational fatty-acyl modification (14Barry E.M.

This is catalyzed by a dedicated protein acyltransferase, CyaC, which can acylate the ε-amino groups of two internal lysine residues of ACT, Lys-983 and Lys-860, located within conserved RTX acylation sites (14Barry E.M. Weiss A.A. Ehrmann I.E. Gray M.C. Hewlett E.L. Goodwin M.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 720-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A.

The mechanism of this novel type of protein acylation was recently analyzed in substantial detail for the prototype RTX toxin-activating and acyl-ACP-dependent protein acyltransferase HlyC, which acylates the homologous lysines 564 and 690 of the Escherichia coli α-hemolysin HlyA (18Issartel J.-P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Nature. 1991; 351: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19Ludwig A. Garcia F. Bauer S. Jarchau T. Benz R. Hoppe J. Goebel W. J.

Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several residues, including Ser-20 and His-23, were identified as being potentially involved in acyl transfer catalysis by HlyC (22Trent M.S. Worsham L.M. Ernst Fonberg M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Trent M.S. Worsham L.M. Ernst Fonberg M.L.

A model of the reaction mechanism was proposed, and formation of an intermediary acyl-ACP·HlyC complex was demonstrated (22Trent M.S. Worsham L.M. Ernst Fonberg M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Trent M.S. Worsham L.M. Ernst Fonberg M.L.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Various acyl-ACP-carrying fatty acids, including the most common in E. coli, the palmitoyl (C16:0) and pamitoleil (C16:1) residues, were found to be efficiently used in vitro as acyl donors for modification of HlyA (18Issartel J.-P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Nature. 1991; 351: 759-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26Trent M.S. Worsham L.M. Ernst Fonberg M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4644-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vivo, however, HlyC exhibits a high selectivity for C14:0 myristic acid, which represents only about 2% of total E. coli fatty acids but was found to constitute about 68% of the acyl chains covalently linked to lysines 564 and 690 of native HlyA (27Lim K.B. Bazemore Walker C.R. Guo L. Pellett S. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Ludwig A. Goebel W. Welch R.A. Hackett M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36698-36702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, the extremely rare odd carbon-saturated C15:0 and C17:0 fatty-acyl residues constituted the rest of the in vivo acylation of HlyA from two different E. coli strains (27Lim K.B. Bazemore Walker C.R. Guo L. Pellett S. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Ludwig A. Goebel W. Welch R.A. Hackett M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36698-36702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of this particular in vivo acylation of HlyA remain unknown. Heterogeneity in extent and nature of acyl residues linked to lysines 983 and 860 was observed previously for ACT from different sources. Native ACT produced by the Bordetella pertussis strain 338 (Bp-ACT) was initially found to be acylated exclusively by palmitoyl residues and only on the lysine 983 (16Hackett M. Guo L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Science. 1994; 266: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast, acylation by a mixture of palmitoleil (cis Δ9 C16:1), palmitoyl (C16:0), and myristoyl (C14:0) fatty-acyl residues was found for the recombinant r-Ec-ACT activated by CyaC in E. coli(17Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Sebo P. J. Biol.

Moreover, in addition to acylation of Lys-983, an incomplete (60%) acylation was found at Lys-860 of r-Ec-ACT (17Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F.

Maier E. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27231-27239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A.

Interestingly, however, the capacity of both forms of ACT to insert into target membranes and to deliver the AC domain into cells (cell invasiveness) was identical (15Sebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene. 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have suggested earlier that acylation of Lys-860 might be an artifact of recombinant expression of ACT in E. coli and that it may selectively affect the propensity of r-Ec-ACT to form the oligomeric channels and to lyse erythrocytes (17Hackett M. Walker C.B. Guo L. Gray M.C. Van C.S. Ullmann A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hewlett E.L. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20250-20253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, however, the r-Bp-ACT produced by a recombinant B. pertussis 18323 strain was found to be fully palmitoylated also on Lys-860, whereas its hemolytic activity was higher than that of r-Ec-ACT (47Havlicek, V., Higgins, L.-A., Chen, W., Halada, P., Sebo, P., Sakamoto, M., and Hackett, M. (2001) J. Mass Spectrom 36, in pressGoogle Scholar). This indicates that the extent of Lys-860 acylation may vary as a function of the strain and physiological state of the producing bacteria and the impact of Lys-860 acylation on biological activity of ACT needs to be established. In a previous study, we have shown that Lys-860 is by itself important for ACT function and that a conservative substitution of Lys-860 by an arginine residue drastically reduced the capacity of ACT to insert into and translocate across target cell membrane (28Basar T. Havlicek V. Bezouskova S. Halada P. Hackett M. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This substitution, however, also prevented the acylation of Lys-860 and it could not be rigorously excluded that this acylation itself, independent of the K860R substitution, was important for cell-invasive activity of ACT. In this study we have generated a set of mutant CyaC acyltransferases, aiming at a definition of residues that are critical to the process of ACT acylation. It is shown, by the use of monoacylating variants of CyaC, that in contrast to acylation of Lys-983, the acylation of Lys-860 alone does not confer cell-invasive activity on ACT. The E. coli K12 strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used throughout this work for DNA manipulation and for expression of ACT. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin. pT7CACT1 is a construct derived from pCACT3 (29Betsou F. Sebo P. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3583-3589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was designed for enhanced production of recombinant CyaC-activated ACT in E. coli (r-Ec-ACT) under control of the IPTG-inducible lacZp promoter (28Basar T. Havlicek V. Bezouskova S. Halada P. Hackett M. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To construct pT7NFLAG-CACT1, a synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-TATGGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAATCACG, encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK), was inserted in-frame into the unique NdeI site encompassing the ATG start codon of cyaC. The fusion was verified by DNA sequencing. The individual substitutions were introduced into the cyaC gene by a two-step PCR mutagenesis procedure using Taq DNA polymerase and appropriate mutagenic and amplification primer pairs listed in Table I. In a first step, two complementary mutagenic primers were used in two separate amplification reactions on the cyaC template DNA to introduce the mutation into two partially overlapping PCR products. These were purified on agarose gel and used as a template in a second PCR amplification with an assembly pair of primers (5′-GGAGATATACATATGGATTATAAAG and 5′-TCTAGAGGATCCTTAGGCGGT) to assemble the whole mutagenized cyaC gene with the desired substitution. The final product was recloned as an NdeI-BamHI fragment into the appropriately digested pT7NFLAG-CACT1, to replace the original cyaC allele. The presence of desired substitutions and the absence of any additional secondary site mutations were systematically verified by resequencing the entire mutagenized cyaC alleles within the pT7NFLAG-CACT construct.Table IList of PCR primers used for mutagenesis and assembly of cyaC allelesSubstitutionPrimer pair sequences1-aThe mutagenized codon is printed in boldface characters with substitution bases underlined.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids for coexpression of the truncated ACTΔ protein together with the mutant NFLAG-CyaC proteins were obtained as described previously, by introducing a TAA stop codon at position 1009 of the cyaAgene. This resulted in production of a truncated ACT protein (ACTΔ) with a C-terminal Asp-1008 residue (28Basar T. Havlicek V. Bezouskova S. Halada P. Hackett M. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The nonacylated variants of ACT and ACTΔ were expressed from plasmids from which the cyaC gene was deleted as an NdeI-BamHI fragment. The ACT and ACTΔ proteins were produced in the presence or absence of the various N-FLAG-CyaC acyltransferase derivatives, using the E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) transformed with the appropriate plasmid derivative of pT7NFLAG-CACT. For ACT production, exponential 500-ml cultures were induced with IPTG (1 mm), and the extracts of insoluble cell debris after sonication were prepared in 8 m urea, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, as described previously (15Sebo P. Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Ullmann A. Gene. 1991; 104: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The differently acylated full-length ACT proteins were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (31Sakamoto H. Bellalou J. Sebo P. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13598-13602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the final step, the proteins were eluted with 8 murea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored frozen. The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay for acylation of the ACTΔ has previously been established and was performed as described in detail elsewhere (28Basar T. Havlicek V. Bezouskova S. Halada P. Hackett M. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It allows separation of the non-, mono-, and biacylated forms of ACTΔ in whole cell extracts, due to the loss of one and/or two positive charges upon acylation of the Lys-860 and/or the Lys-983 residues, respectively, which causes alteration of the isoelectric point of the protein. Briefly, whole cell extracts of the respective clones expressing the truncated ACTΔ protein, together with the different CyaC acyltransferase variants, were prepared from exponentially growing cultures induced by IPTG (1 mm) for 3 h. Total protein samples (20 μg) were analyzed by large format two-dimensional (IEF/SDS-PAGE) gel electrophoresis (32O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Investigator system (Oxford Glycosystems). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. We have previously demonstrated that the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of whole cell samples provides a convenient and unambiguous semiquantitative assay for assessment of ACTΔ acylation in vivo. It has further been shown by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight) and tandem mass spectrometry of purified preparations that acylation of ACTΔ reflects well the acylation of full-length ACT produced under similar experimental conditions (28Basar T.

The location and identity of the acyl modifications on ACT produced in the presence of certain NFLAG-CyaC variants were analyzed by LC/MS/MS and MALDI-TOF MS techniques as described previously (16Hackett M.

Tryptic and Asp-N fragments were generated according to standard protocols and separated on 50-μm inner diameter × 12-cm capillary column packed with Magic 5-μm, 200-Å C18 material (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA), at a flow rate of 150 nl·min−1, with a 2–95% acetonitrile gradient (1% acetic acid) over 40 min. Peptide analysis by microcapillary high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a Finnigan TSQ 7000 electrospray tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer was performed as described in detail elsewhere (33Wang H.

Chem. 1998; 70: 205-212Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Positive-ion MALDI-TOF mass spectra were measured on a Bruker BIFLEX-III reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a SCOUT-384 inlet and gridless delayed extraction ion source. Ion acceleration voltage was 19 kV, and the reflectron (ion mirror) voltage was set to 20 kV. For delayed extraction, a 4-kV potential difference between the probe and the extraction lens was applied with a time delay in the range of 200–400 ns after each laser pulse. Samples were irradiated at a frequency of 5 Hz by 337-nm photons from a pulsed Laser Science (Cambridge, MA) nitrogen laser. Typically, 20–50 shots were summed into a single mass spectrum. 4-Hydroxy-α-cyano-cinnamic acid was used as the MALDI matrix. Spectra were calibrated externally using the monoisotopic [M+H]+ ion of a peptide standard (bombesin, Aldrich) and reprocessed by Bruker XMASS 5.0 software. Identities of the C16:0 and C16:1 cis Δ9 fatty acyl groups were confirmed by capillary GC/MS with electron impact ionization after a one-step extraction and derivatization procedure (35Lepage G. Roy C.C. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 114-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylate cyclase (AC) activities were measured as described previously in the presence of 1 μmcalmodulin (36Glaser P. Sakamoto H. Bellalou J. Ullmann A. Danchin A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3997-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). One unit of AC activity corresponds to 1 μmol of cAMP formed per min at 30 °C, pH 8.0. Cell-invasive AC was determined as the amount of AC that became protected against externally added trypsin upon internalization into erythrocytes within 30 min of incubation (9Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hemolytic activity was measured as the hemoglobin released upon incubation of washed sheep erythrocytes (5 × 108/ml) with the toxins for 270 min, respectively (9Bellalou J. Sakamoto H. Ladant D. Geoffroy C. Ullmann A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocyte binding of the toxins was determined as described in detail previously (37Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The acyl-ACP-dependent acyltransferases activating RTX toxins exhibit a very high degree of sequence conservation. This makes identification of functionally essential residues of CyaC difficult. Substitution of several potentially catalytic serine, histidine, and cysteine residues of CyaC was, therefore, performed to probe their functional importance (Fig.1). The substitutions were introduced into a CyaC construct tagged by a FLAG epitope at its N-terminal end (N-FLAG-CyaC). This allowed tracking of mutant CyaC in vivo and discrimination between loss of function and enhanced degradation of CyaC. The N-FLAG-CyaC, carrying various substitutions, were coexpressed in E. coli with the full-length pro-ACT to assess the capacity of CyaC variants to confer cell-invasive activity on ACT. In parallel, the capacity of the CyaC variants to acylate in vivo a C-terminally truncated pro-ACTΔ derivative of ACT was determined by a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis IEF/SDS-PAGE assay (28Basar T.

We have previously demonstrated that this allows a straightforward and reliable assessment of the relative abundance of the differently charged non-mono- and biacylated forms of ACTΔ in whole cell extracts and that pro-ACTΔ undergoes identical acylation as the full-length pro-ACT (28Basar T.

As summarized in Table II and documented in Fig.2 A (fields 1–4), the N-terminal addition of the FLAG epitope did not alter the toxin activation and acylation capacity of CyaC. Replacement of the highly conserved cysteine 67 by a serine residue (Cys-67 → Ser) and of the serine 68 by a threonine residue (Ser-68 → Thr), respectively, had no observable effect on the toxin-activating capacity of N-FLAG-CyaC in vivo, as documented in Table II and illustrated for the S68T-CyaC in Fig. 2 A (fields 5 and 6). In contrast, the ACTΔ proteins produced in the presence of the Ser-30 → Arg (S30R), Ser-30 → Trp (S30W), His-33 → Asp (H33D), and His-33 → Ser (H33S) variants of CyaC, respectively, migrated in two-dimensional gels at the position of nonacylated pro-ACTΔ and resolved quantitatively from the more acidic monoacylated ACTΔK860R and biacylated ACTΔ standards (28Basar T. Havlicek V. Bezouskova S. Halada P. Hackett M. Sebo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), when these were added to the samples (Fig. 2 A, fields 7–15). In agreement with a complete loss of fatty-acyl activation, the toxin activity of full-length ACT produced in vivo in the presence of the same CyaC variants was nil, as shown in Table II. However, normal levels of CyaC proteins carrying the substitutions of Ser-30 and His-33 were detected in cellular extracts by Western blotting (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that the Ser-30 and His-33 residues are specifically required for the acylating activity of CyaC. Indeed, while this work was in progress, the same conclusion on the role of the corresponding Ser-20 and His-23 residues of HlyC was drawn from an extensive in vitro characterization of intact and mutant HlyC variants (22Trent M.S.

An assay was developed wherein conditioned medium derived from the Xenopus XTC cell line induced the formation of a full-length notochord and rows of bilaterally symmetric somites. Basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, retinoic acid, and transforming growth factor type B1 and B2 were not capable of inducing axial structures. Thus, soluble factors can elicit the development of polarity stored in the epiblast and behave as true morphogens since they can induce the formation of the organized complex structures that constitute the embryonic axis."
https://openalex.org/W2060575399,"The xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) is one of the most common forms of this cancer-prone syndrome. XP groups A through G are characterized by defective nucleotide excision repair, whereas the XP-V phenotype is proficient in this pathway. The XPV gene encodes DNA polymerase eta, which catalyzes an accurate translesion synthesis, indicating that the XPV gene contributes tumor suppression in normal individuals. Here we describe the genomic structure and chromosomal localization of the XPV gene, which includes 11 exons covering the entire coding sequence, lacks a TATA sequence in the upstream region of the transcription-initiation, and is located at the chromosome band 6p21.1-6p12. Analyses of patient-derived XP-V cell lines strongly suggested that three of four cell lines carried homozygous mutations in the XPV gene. The fourth cell line, XP1RO, carried heterozygous point mutations in the XPV gene, one of which was located at the splice acceptor site of exon 2, resulting in the omission of exon 2 from the mature mRNA. These findings provide a basis for diagnosis and therapy of XP-V patients."

Although expressed in the intestine of some nematodes, the biological and biochemical functions of the CBL proteins remain unresolved. Di- and tetra-oligopeptides were used as fluorogenic substrates and irreversible/competitive inhibitors to establish CBL functions in the intestine of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus. Cysteine protease activity was detected against diverse substrates including the cathepsin B/L substrate FR, the caspase 1 substrate YVAD, the cathepsin B substrate RR, but not the CED-3 (caspase 3) substrate DEVD. The pH at which maximum activity was detected varied according to substrate and ranged from pH 5.0 to 7.0. Individual CBLs were affinity isolated using FA and YVAD substrates. pH influenced CBL affinity isolation in a substrate-specific manner that paralleled pH effects on individual substrates. N-terminal sequencing identified two isolated CBLs as H. contortus GCP-7 (33 kDa) and AC-4 (37 kDa). N termini of each began at a position consistent with proregion cleavage and protease activation. Isolation of the GCP-7 band by each peptide was preferentially inhibited when competed with a diazomethane-conjugated inhibitor, Z-FA-CHN2, demonstrating one functional difference among CBLs and among inhibitors.

The functions of CBL proteins remain unresolved at both a biochemical and biological level. Severalcbl genes were shown to be expressed in the intestine of the parasitic worm Haemonchus contortus or in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (1Pratt D. Armes L.G. Hageman R.

DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Accordingly, one function of nematode CBLs might be nutrient digestion. CBLs may have application to control of parasitic nematodes in multiple ways. For instance, CBLs that function in host blood digestion are considered potential anthelmintic targets in schistosome flatworms (5Brindley P.J. Kalinna B.H. Dalton J.P. Day S.R. Wong J.Y. Smythe M.L.

Parasitol. 1996; 81: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). CBLs are also currently considered as vaccine candidates for immune control of parasitic nematodes, including H. contortus(6Wasilewski M.M. Lim K.C. Phillips J. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem.

Alternatively, digestive proteases may indirectly mediate anthelmintic efficacy involving benzimidazole anthelmintics (10Jasmer D.P. Yao C. Rehman A. Johnson S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Following fenbendazole treatment of lambs, anterior intestinal cells ofH. contortus undergo fragmentation of nuclear DNA and tissue disintegration (10Jasmer D.P. Yao C. Rehman A. Johnson S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pattern of DNA fragmentation resembled that associated with apoptosis, which can be initiated by caspase and noncaspase cysteine proteases (11Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 12Vaux D.L. Wilhelm S. Hacker G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6502-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), while CED-3 is a prominent nematode caspase (13Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Both tissue disintegration and DNA fragmentation was associated with inhibited transport of secretory vesicles and subsequent cytoplasmic dispersal of vesicle contents in anterior intestinal cells (10Jasmer D.P. Yao C. Rehman A. Johnson S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody (mAb 42/10.6.1) used to monitor secretory vesicle contents binds to a periodate-sensitive determinant found on numerous intestinal membrane and secretory proteins (14Jasmer J.P. Perryman L.E. Conder G.A. Crow S. McGuire T.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5450-5460PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins that were immunoaffinity isolated by this mAb included an intestinal CBL, among other proteases (15Rehman A. Jasmer D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, CBLs might mediate some of the intestinal pathology induced by fenbendazole treatment. Despite these connections with basic aspects of parasite biology, CBLs remain enigmatic. The complexity of the family (16Rehman A. Jasmer D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) has hindered biochemical and functional characterization of CBLs. Intestinal CBLs have predicted signal peptides and are expected to be secreted. CBLs also have predicted proregions, and N termini of some isolated CBLs indicated propeptide cleavage (4Larminie C.G. Johnstone I.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Rehman A. Jasmer D.P. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1990; 41: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cysteine protease activity was detected in H. contortus intestine and excretory-secretory products (ESP). This activity was characterized as cathepsin l-like, based on hydrolysis of Phe-Arg, but not Arg-Arg, dipeptide substrates (18Rhoads M.L. Fetterer R.H. J. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Glu245 was implicated in determining the ability of cathepsin B to degrade substrates with an Arg in the P2 position, a characteristic that is distinct from cathepsins L and S (16Rehman A. Jasmer D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Musil D. Zucic D. Turk D. et al.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Most predicted CBL sequences from H. contortus lack a Glu corresponding to position 245 in cathepsin B (16Rehman A. Jasmer D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which theoretically could compromise the ability of H. contortus CBLs to hydrolyze Arg-Arg substrates. This simple picture is complicated by several observations. In H. contortus ESP, distinct zymogram bands of cysteine protease activity were restricted to acidic pH, while others were active from acidic to neutral conditions (20Karanu F.N. Rurangirwa F.R. McGuire T.C. Jasmer D.P. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phe-Arg substrate-based affinity probes identified four protease bands from ESP. This number was more restricted than expected according to the size of the CBL gene family reported. Substantial amino acid diversity was observed among CBL sequences at multiple positions within predicted S2 and S2′ subsite residues, and then, between CBLs and cathepsin B (16Rehman A. Jasmer D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Musil D. Zucic D. Turk D. et al.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Such diversity might translate into CBL properties that are distinct from related mammalian enzymes. Specific properties have not been attributed to any individual H. contortus CBL, which has hindered more directed research on recombinant forms of these enzymes. In this study, H. contortus intestinal CBLs were directly linked to known cysteine protease activity from this worm. Substrates for known cathepsin L, cathepsin B, caspase 1, and CED-3 (caspase 3) enzymes proved effective for dissecting distinct CBL activities. The results provide guidance to investigate these CBLs in relation to normal biological functions, functional diversity among individual CBLs and CBL contributions to anthelmintic-induced intestinal pathology. Fluorogenic peptide substrates included Ac-YVAD.AMC, Ac-DEVD.AMC, Z-FR.MNA, and Z-RR.MNA. Competitive peptide inhibitors included Ac-YVAD.CHO and Ac-DEVD.CHO. Irreversible peptide inhibitors included Z-FA.CHN2, Bt-YVAD.FMK, and Bt-FA.FMK. All of these substrates were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Approximately 10,000 viable L3 larvae of a Beltsville isolate of H. contortus (21Jasmer D.P. McGuire T.C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to orally infect 4–8-month-old parasite-free lambs, which were killed 25–27 days after infection. Adult worms were harvested for dissection of intestines and for culture to obtain ESP (20Karanu F.N. Rurangirwa F.R. McGuire T.C. Jasmer D.P. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Intestines thawed from −80 °C were homogenized in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Protein concentration of lysates was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). The extracts were stored in 200-μl aliquots at −80 °C. Protease activity was initially determined using the fluorogenic di- and tetrapeptide substrates, Z-FR.MNA, Z-RR.MNA, Ac-YVAD.AMC, and Ac-DEVD.AMC at 50 μm concentrations. Reactions were performed in 1.5-ml volumes with 10 μg of intestinal extracts or ESP and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were evaluated at 30-min intervals for 2 h and activity reported for the 2-h incubations. Worm samples without substrates served as negative control. Inhibition studies incorporated protease-specific class inhibitors including 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm E-64, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 100 μm iodoacetic acid, 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, or 5 mm EDTA. In addition, substrate-based dipeptide (Z-FA.CHN2) and tetrapeptide (Ac-YVAD.CHO, Ac-YVAD.FMK) protease inhibitors were used. The pH activity profiles were established using the following buffers: 100 mm citrate phosphate (pH 3.0–7.0) or 100 mm phosphate (pH 8.0) and 50 mm glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) containing 10 mm DTT. Classic caspase activity was evaluated under conditions of 10 mm DTT, 312.5 mm HEPES, 31.25% sucrose, 0.3125% CHAPS (pH 7.5). Liberation of the leaving fluorescent groups, AMC and MNA, was monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (MPF 42A, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm (AMC), respectively, or 340 and 425 nm (MNA), respectively. Specific activity was determined in picomoles of AMC or MNA liberated per minute per microgram of protein at 37 °C. A standard curve produced with free AMC or MNA was used for these measurements. Enzyme reactions were done by incubating 64 μg of intestinal extract with biotinylated irreversible substrate inhibitors Bt-YVAD.FMK or Bt-FA.FMK (5 μm) in 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 10 mm DTT. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Following this incubation, a mixture of protease inhibitors (100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 10 μm E-64) was added to the solution. The mixture was adjusted to 0.2% SDS and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. This solution was used for affinity isolation procedures described below. Inhibition reactions were run by incubating the intestinal extracts with nonbiotinylated irreversible inhibitors, Ac-YVAD.FMK (5 μm), Z-FA.CHN2 (5 μm), or E-64 (10 μm) for 5 min (37 °C) prior to incubation with biotinylated substrate inhibitors. Proteases conjugated to inhibitors were isolated by incubation with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma, St Louis, MO.) for 2 h at room temperature with gentle rotation. Bound beads were washed 5 times with 0.1 m glycine and 1% SDS (pH 8.0). The streptavidin-agarose beads were boiled in 3X-sample buffer for 15 min. Eluted proteins were fractionated on 7.5–17.5% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (22Towbin H. Gordon H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS, Tween 20 (0.1%), and nonfat dry milk (5%). Membranes were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. Bound streptavidin was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Amersham Place, United Kingdom). TheM r of stained proteins was estimated using prestained Rainbow molecular mass standards ranging from 14.3 to 200 kDa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This mAb (IgG2a) was used on immunoblots of affinity isolated proteases to evaluate glycosylation of CBLs and purity of the preparations. This mAb also provided enhanced sensitivity for evaluating affinity isolated proteins from ESP. Immunoblots were done with mAb 42/10.6.1 (2 μg/ml) as described (14Jasmer J.P. Perryman L.E. Conder G.A. Crow S. McGuire T.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5450-5460PubMed Google Scholar). An isotype control mAb (Babb) against an irrelevant determinant was used as a control on replicate blots. Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:3000 (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). The blot was developed using ECL. Proteases were isolated using Bt-YVAD.FMK (pH 5.0) or Bt-FA.FMK (pH 5.0 and 7.0). Affinity isolation procedures were optimized in standard assays by titrating the following components: peptide inhibitors, DTT, streptavidin-agarose beads, and the incubation time. Affinity isolation assays were then scaled up 50-fold to produce an estimated 450 pmol of proteins. Isolated proteases were fractionated on 7.5–17.5% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Transblotted proteins were visualized by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue for 10 min, followed by rapid destaining. Destained bands were excised and their N-terminal amino acid sequence determined using an Applied Biosystems 494/HT Procise sequencing system (University of Texas Medical Branch, Protein Chemistry Laboratory, Galveston, TX). Location of H. contortus intestinal proteases was determined using the biotinylated peptide inhibitors Bt-YVAD.FMK and Bt-FA.FMK. Whole worms were placed in OCT compound (Tissue-TekR, Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN) and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Five micrometer tissue sections were cut using a cryotome, attached to ProbeOn™ Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and air-dried for 30 min. Tissue sections were fixed in 30% methanol, 60% acetone, and 10% distilled H2O for 30 s at room temperature. Subsequently, the tissues were rinsed in PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in 0.1m citrate-phosphate pH 5.0 buffer, 10 mm DTT, containing 5 μm Bt-YVAD.FMK or 5 μmBt-FA.FMK. Inhibitor control tissue sections were pre-incubated with nonbiotinylated protease inhibitors or 5 μm E-64 for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of biotinylated inhibitors. Negative control tissues were incubated without the peptides. The slides were then washed twice, for 5 min each, in wash buffer and blocked for 30 min at room temperature using PBS, Tween 20 (0.1%), and 10% normal sheep serum. Endogenous peroxidase inhibitor was included in reactions (Peroxidase Suppressor, ImmunoPureR; Pierce). Bound peptides were detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. Streptavidin and biotin complexes were visualized using the ImmunoPure Metal Enhanced DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) substrate kit (Pierce). Protease activity was evaluated in intestinal extracts and ESP using four peptide substrates with the following sequences (designations): FR (cathepsins B/L), RR (cathepsin B), YVAD (caspase 1), and DEVD (caspase 3/CED-3). Initial interest in evaluating caspase substrates arose from the DNA fragmentation that can be induced by fenbendazole in intestinal cell nuclei of this parasite (10Jasmer D.P. Yao C. Rehman A. Johnson S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments at pH 5.0 demonstrated activity against each substrate, with the exception of DEVD (Fig.1). When further evaluated, optimal pH for activity varied according to the substrate used. For example, activity against the YVAD substrate was restricted predominately to acidic pH, while activity against the RR substrate was highest around pH 6.0, and relatively high activity against the FR substrate occurred from pH 4.5 to 7.5 (Fig. 2,A–C). No activity against the DEVD substrate was detected under any of the described pH conditions, including preferred caspase conditions (data not shown). Significant activity against the RR substrate was not expected in H. contortus intestine based on a previous report (18Rhoads M.L. Fetterer R.H. J. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, the preferential activity against YVAD under acidic conditions is inconsistent for caspases, which have neutral pH requirements (11Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).Figure 2pH effects on intestinal and ESP protease activity. Protease activities in intestinal extracts (int) and ESP of H. contortus were assayed at pH 3.0–9.0 with Z-FR.MNA (A), Z-RR.MNA (B), and Ac-YVAD.AMC (C). Means of triplicate assays are shown.Bars represent standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibitory effects of leupeptin and E-64 indicated that the majority of the activities against FR, RR, and YVAD substrates from intestine and ESP are due to cysteine proteases (TableI). Some variation on inhibition was observed among substrates with iodoacetic acid. Similar inhibitory results were obtained for FR and RR substrates at pH 5.0–6.0 (data not shown). Although 1,10-phenanthroline had moderate inhibitory effect on activities (57–87%), cysteine protease inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline may be ascribed to a possible metal ion chelate. Although the relatively low inhibitory effect of EDTA supports this possibility, activity contributed by noncysteine proteases cannot be completely ruled out by these experiments. In contrast to the relative insensitivity of caspases to E-64 and leupeptin, intestinal activity against the YVAD substrate was ablated by both inhibitors. This result and observations on pH requirements suggested that activity against the YVAD substrate is conferred by noncaspase cysteine protease activity.Table IMean percentage of inhibition of protease activity from extracts of adult H. contortus intestineClass InhibitorSubstrates 1-aFluorogenic peptide substrates Z-FR.MNA, Z-RR.MNA, and Ac-YVAD.AMC.YVADFRRRCysteine Leupeptin98.0 1-bPercentage of inhibition (S.D.)

Open table in a new tab The possibility that related cysteine proteases confer activity against each of the substrates was evaluated by cross-inhibition experiments. Fluorogenic peptide substrates and peptide-based irreversible inhibitors were used in these experiments. Since no inhibitor construct was available for the RR substrate, experiments focused on the YVAD- and FR-based inhibitors. Additionally, a FA substrate modified by diazomethane (CHN2) was previously shown to inhibit H. contortus cysteine protease activity (20Karanu F.N. Rurangirwa F.R. McGuire T.C. Jasmer D.P. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and was used here. Activity against each substrate was inhibited at pH 5.0 by the irreversible inhibitors Ac-YVAD.FMK and Z-FA.CHN2 (Fig. 3). The inhibitor Ac-YVAD.CHO had similar effects on both YVAD and FR hydrolysis (data not shown). The high level of cross-inhibition suggested that a major portion of the activity against all substrates resided in the same enzymes at pH 5.0. In contrast to YVAD, hydrolysis of the FR substrate was relatively high at pH 7.0. However, this activity was inhibited by Z-FA.CHN2 (92%), Ac-YVAD.FMK (94%), and Ac-YVAD.CHO (78%). This result suggests that pH 7.0 inhibited protease binding by YVAD to a much lesser extent than protease hydrolysis of this substrate, which will be discussed below. Nevertheless, the higher level of inhibition by the irreversible inhibitor Ac-YVAD.FMK compared with Ac-YVAD.CHO may indicate low level hydrolysis of this substrate at pH 7.0. Biotinylated peptide substrates modified by a fluoromethylketone reactive group were used to isolate, characterize, and identify proteases that hydrolyze the peptide substrates described. Use of Bt-YVAD.FMK led to isolation of multiple prominent bands ranging from 29 to 37 kDa (Fig.4 A), with a 42-kDa band that was weakly visible (lane 2). A 33-kDa band was most prominent in multiple experiments. A similar profile of proteins was isolated by Bt-FA.FMK (lane 6), although the signal was always reduced compared with Bt-YVAD.FMK. A 33-kDa band was also most prominent in this lane, followed by a 37-kDa band. E-64 eliminated bands isolated by each of the biotinylated substrates, indicating they are cysteine proteases. Use of the nonbiotinylated inhibitor Ac-YVAD.FMK produced similar results. A Bt-DEVD.FMK probe failed to isolate any detectable bands from intestinal lysates (data not shown). The diazomethane inhibitor Z-FA.CHN2 was more discriminating, causing obvious reduction of only the 33-kDa band in preparations isolated by both the Bt-YVAD.FMK and Bt-FA.FMK. The two discernible weaker bands remaining at this position may reflect incomplete inhibition. Since Z-FA.CHN2 reduced activity against the FR and YVAD fluorogenic substrates by 100% and 94%, respectively (Fig. 3), proteases from the 33-kDa band may be largely responsible for hydrolyzing these substrates. Alternatively, Z-FA.CHN2 could function in fluorogenic assays as a competitive inhibitor against proteases that are otherwise resistant to irreversible binding by this inhibitor. Previous results suggested that CBLs are modified by the periodate-sensitive determinant recognized by mAb 42/10.6.1 (16Rehman A. Jasmer D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This determinant occurs on a multitude of membrane/secreted/excreted proteins from H. contortus (14Jasmer J.P. Perryman L.E. Conder G.A. Crow S. McGuire T.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5450-5460PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis showed that most, if not all, proteins affinity-purified by Bt-YVAD.FMK and Bt-FA.FMK are modified by the mAb 42/10.6.1 determinant. In addition, the restricted size range of isolated proteins, compared with whole intestinal lysates, demonstrated a high level of purity in these preparations (Fig. 4 B). pH effects were evaluated on affinity isolation at pH 5.0 and 7.0. The bands isolated by Bt-YVAD.FMK at pH 5.0 were eliminated at pH 7.0 (Fig. 5). In contrast, a similar profile of bands was isolated by Bt-FA.FMK regardless of the pH conditions used. These results are consistent with the pH effects on hydrolysis of fluorogenic substrates. Characteristics established for presumptive intestinal proteases were next applied to evaluate proteins in ESP. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase lacked necessary sensitivity for this purpose. Alternatively, mAb 42/10.6.1 provided for a sensitive detection method. A size range of proteins was isolated from ESP by each substrate that paralleled those found in intestine (Fig. 5). The proteins isolated behaved in a substrate- and pH-dependent manner that paralleled intestinal proteins. The results also establish that the isolated proteins are modified by the mAb determinant. Collectively, results agree with a previous report (18Rhoads M.L. Fetterer R.H. J. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that the ESP proteins most likely represent intestinal cysteine proteases excreted from the parasite. N-terminal sequencing was done on two isolated intestinal protein bands. The 33-kDa band was chosen based on evidence of activity against both YVAD and FR substrates. The 37-kDa band was chosen due to the relative resolution of this band and the resistance of the band to inhibition by Z-FA.CHN2. N-terminal sequences were obtained for bands isolated at pH 5.0 (FA, YVAD) and 7.0 (FA). Current data bases contain an estimated 11 published H. contortus CBL sequences (25Schotte P. Declercq W. Huffel S. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and expressed sequence tags for an additional 11 unique CBLs. 2S. Shompole and D. P. Jasmer, unpublished data.The N-terminal sequences from each band had greatest similarity withH. contortus CBLs (Fig. 6). The sequences began at a uniform site consistent for pro-region cleavage, which is expected for the active proteases. Each sequence (20–24 residues) of the 37-kDa protein band isolated by each inhibitor, regardless of pH, exactly matched the H. contortus CBL AC-4 (Fig. 6). The residue corresponding to a single predicted cysteine residue was ambiguous in the protein sequences. The AC-4 sequence has multiple amino acids that are distinct from other CBLs, especially from consensus residues 11–17, providing a high degree of confidence in this identification.

We investigated gene expression during the early phase of the cell death program evoked by potassium deprivation. Using a differential gene display technique, we isolated a cDNA that was increased by potassium deprivation. This cDNA was homologous to the 3′ mRNA end of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a gene encoding a secreted glycoprotein whose expression is restricted to the nervous system. Reverse-Northern and Northern blot analyses confirmed that treatment with low potassium induces overexpression of NP1 mRNA, with a subsequent increase in NP1 protein levels. Time-course studies indicated that overexpression of NP1 protein reaches a maximum after 4 h of exposure to potassium deprivation and 4 h before significant cell death. Incubation of cerebellar granule cells with an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide directed against NP1 mRNA reduced low potassium-evoked NP1 protein levels by 60% and attenuated neuronal death by 50%, whereas incubation with the corresponding sense oligodeoxyribonucleotide was ineffective. Furthermore, acute treatment with lithium significantly inhibited both overexpression of NP1 and cell death evoked by low potassium.

Oppenheim R.W. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 427-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This process determines the size and shape of the vertebrate nervous system (2Kuan C.Y. Roth K.A. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and the cell death that results from it exhibits the morphological features of apoptosis (3Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6721) Google Scholar). Apoptotic death is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation at internucleosomal sites, and degeneration of cell membrane-bound particles that are phagocytized by macrophages without an inflammatory response. Recent evidence indicates that gene expression-dependent apoptosis is also involved in the pathological death of mature neurons observed in various neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, or following brain ischemia or traumatic injury of the central nervous system (4Nicotera P. Leist M. Manzo L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 46-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Leist M. Nicotera P. Exp.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3775-3787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the mechanisms involved in gene expression-dependent apoptotic death of mature neurons are not well characterized. One of the most documented in vitro models to investigate gene expression-dependent apoptosis in mature neuronal cells is death induced by nondepolarizing culture conditions (9D'mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 10Miller T.M. Johnson E.M. J.

Cerebellar granule cells require depolarizing concentrations of potassium (25–30 mm) to be maintained in culture (12Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When these cells are mature, reduction of the extracellular concentration of potassium produces a cell death that is morphologically apoptotic. This cell death evoked by low potassium is associated with DNA fragmentation and requires both new RNA and protein synthesis (9D'mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), because addition of protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors within the first 4 h of exposure to potassium deprivation prevents cell death and results in a complete recovery of the damaged DNA (9D'mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar,13Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P.

Likewise, replacement of high concentrations of potassium within 4 h after treatment with low potassium results in no cell loss. However, the activation of the cell death program becomes irreversible in ∼50% of cerebellar granule cells after 6 h of exposure to low potassium (14Nardi N. Avidan G. Daily D. Zilkhafalb R. Barzilai A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In neurons, apoptotic death may be mediated by posttranslational mechanisms as well as by “de novo” expression of death genes. However, it has been proposed that the mechanisms involved in low potassium-mediated apoptosis of granule neurons are similar to those operating in neuronal death during development or following blockade of neuronal activity, which require new mRNA and protein synthesis (9D'mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Consequently, strategies directed to identify genes whose expression is increased before neuronal cells reach the commitment to die may help to identify new targets for neuroprotection. Based on this assumption, we have investigated gene expression during the early phase of the cell death program. Overexpression of several genes has been associated with cerebellar granule cell death induced by low potassium. Thus, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)1 overexpression has been shown to be involved in the initiation of the apoptotic process evoked by low potassium (16Sunaga K. Takahashi H. Chuang D.M. Ishitani R. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Ishitani R. Sunaga K. Tanaka M. Aishita H. Chuang D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other genes whose overexpression has been found to mediate apoptosis by potassium deprivation include those for the ICE-related protease CPP32 (18Eldadah B.A. Yakovlev A.G. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), c-Jun (10Miller T.M. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Egr-1 (19Catania M.V. Copani A. Calogero A. Ragonese G.I. Condorelli D.F. Nicoletti F. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the transcription factor of cyclin-dependent kinases E2F-1 (20O'Hare M.J. Hou S.T. Morris E.J. Cregan S.P. Xu Q. Slack R.S. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25358-25364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the identification of other genes of the neuronal death program is necessary to understand the relationship among the different biochemical mechanisms of the apoptotic signal pathway activated by reduction of synaptic activity. Using a differential gene display technique (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar), we have investigated gene expression evoked by low potassium in cerebellar granule cells. We now report that treatment with low potassium induces the overexpression of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a gene that was originally identified and isolated as a rat protein that mediates the calcium-dependent uptake of the snake venom toxin, taipoxin (22Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). NP1 encodes a glycoprotein of an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa that is predicted to be secreted and whose expression is restricted to the nervous system (22Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides against NP1 inhibit low potassium-induced cell death. Thus, the present results provide evidence of a new function for NP1 and indicate that NP1 is part of the gene program of apoptotic death in cerebellar granule cells kept under nondepolarizing culture conditions. Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from 7-day postnatal Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Harlan) as described previously (23Olmos G. DeGregorio-Rocasolano N. Regalado M.P. Gasull T. Boronat M.A. Trullas R. Villarroel A. Lerma J. Garcia-Sevilla J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Viu E. Zapata A. Capdevila J.L. Fossom L.H. Skolnick P. Trullas R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar). Procedures involving animals and their care were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Barcelona and conducted in conformity with institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national (Generalitat de Catalunya decree 214/1997, DOGC 2450) and international (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Institutes of Health publication 85-23, 1985) laws and policies. Cells were dissociated in the presence of trypsin and DNase I, and plated in dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml). Granule cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105cells/cm2 in basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated), 0,1 mg/ml gentamicin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 mm KCl. Cerebellar granule cell cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, 95% air and remained undisturbed until experiments were performed. The replication of non-neuronal cells was prevented by addition of 10 μmcytosine-d-arabinofuranoside to the culture medium 24 h after plating. Cells were used for experiments after 8 days in culture (8DIV). Previous studies have shown that cerebellar granule cells maintained in medium supplemented with 25 mm K+ undergo apoptotic death when switched to 5 mm K+ (9D'mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In addition, exposure of cerebellar granule cells to fresh serum-containing medium triggers excitotoxicity (25Yan G.M. Ni B.H. Weller M. Wood K.A. Paul S.M. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This neurotoxicity does not occur if conditioned medium is used (25Yan G.M. Ni B.H. Weller M. Wood K.A. Paul S.M. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, after 8 days in culture, the medium in which cerebellar granule cells had grown, referred to as conditioned medium (Sc+K+), was replaced with one of the following media: fresh unconditioned serum-free medium supplemented with 25 mm potassium (S−K+) or fresh unconditioned serum-free medium containing 5 mmpotassium (S−K−). Immediately after replacement, cells were incubated at 37 °C for different times up to 24 h. Treatments with lithium and antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) were performed at 8DIV immediately after the replacement of the media described above. LiCl was added to the cultures at a concentration of 5 mm. In pilot experiments, we found that the optimal concentration of ODNs was 10 μm. A 21-base-long phosphorothioated antisense ODN against the NP1 mRNA and its corresponding sense ODN were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The sequences were 5′-GCGTGCGGCGCGGCCGGCCAG-3′ for the NP1 antisense ODN (NP1AS) and 5′-C T GGCCGGCCGCGCCGCACGC-3′ for the corresponding sense ODN (NP1S). The phosphorothioated nucleotides are underlined. The NP1 antisense ODN sequence corresponds to nucleotides 4–24, which immediately follow the first initiation codon of the coding sequence of the NP1 cDNA. Cell death was assessed using propidium iodide (PI) staining. PI is excluded by the plasma membrane of viable cells. Injury to the cytoplasmic membrane allows the entry of PI, which, by interacting with nuclear DNA, yields a bright red fluorescence. In time-course experiments, PI fluorescence was measured in 24-well plates using a CytoFluor 2350 scanner (Millipore, Barcelona, Spain) with 530 nm (25-nm band pass) excitation and 645 nm (40-nm band pass) emission filters. The percentage of nonviable cells was measured using a modification of the method described by Rudolph et al. (26Rudolph J.G. Lemasters J.J. Crews F.T. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 221: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Base-line fluorescence F0 was measured immediately after treatment with the corresponding medium and addition of PI (30 μm). Subsequent fluorescence readings were obtained at different times after the beginning of treatment. At the end of the experiment, cells were permeabilized with 375 μm digitonin for 10 min at 37 °C to obtain the maximum fluorescence corresponding to 100% of cell death (Fmax). Percentage of cell death was calculated as follows: % cell death = 100 × (Fn − F0)/(Fmax −F0), where Fn is fluorescence at any given time. Cells were kept in the incubator between measurements. In some experiments, percentage of dead cells was measured counting PI stained over total number of cells using simultaneous fluorescence and phase contrast observation in an epifluorescence microscope. In these experiments, cells were incubated with 10 μm PI for 30 min and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature before addition of a final glycerol protective layer. Gene expression was assessed with the differential display technique as described by Liang and Pardee (21Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4694) Google Scholar) using the RNA image kit from GenHunter. Total RNA from cerebellar granule cells exposed to S−K+ and S−K− for 2 and 4 h was isolated using the Rneasy mini kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I (GenHunter, Nashville, TN). First strand cDNA synthesis and33P-radiolabeled differential display PCR were performed using the RNA image kit (GenHunter). The PCR reactions were performed in duplicate for each treatment. The amplified cDNAs were resolved by electrophoresis using a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After immobilizing the gel on Whatman no. 3MM paper and drying it for 30 min under vacuum at 80 °C, the gel was exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight. The autoradiogram and the dried gel were oriented with needle punches to be able to locate in the gel the bands identified in the film. After developing the film, the patterns of amplified cDNA bands were compared among treatments. We chose cDNA bands exhibiting a higher intensity in S−K− compared with S−K+, which indicates that low potassium treatment induces the overexpression of a gene represented in the band. The cDNA bands of interest were excised from the gel, reamplified by PCR with the same set of primers and PCR conditions used in the mRNA display but with a higher concentration of dNTPs, and ligated into the pCR-TRAP cloning vector (GenHunter). Ligated plasmids were transformed into GH-competent cells and plated on LB plates containing 20 μg/ml tetracycline. The pCR-TRAP vector includes a tetracycline-dependent positive selection of plasmids with DNA inserts. Only recombinant plasmids confer antibiotic resistance. To verify overexpression of the cDNA fragments identified by differential display, we used two different procedures: reverse Northern dot blot and Northern blot. Bands excised from the gel may contain different cDNA species. To identify the cDNA that is overexpressed in the band, we used the reverse Northern dot blot technique (27Zhang H. Zhang R. Liang P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2454-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This procedure allows the isolation and identification of cDNAs that actually correspond to differentially expressed mRNAs, from bands excised from a differential display gel. For reverse Northern dot blot experiments, tetracycline-resistant colonies were randomly picked from each plate and lysed by boiling in 50 μl of lysis buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in TE buffer, pH 8.0). The cloned cDNA fragments were amplified using primers flanking the cloning site of the vector. Each PCR product was dot-blotted onto duplicate nylon membranes using a microfiltration system. The membranes were UV-cross-linked and probed with total [32P]cDNA. The [32P]cDNA probes were prepared by reverse transcription of 20 μg of total RNA obtained from cerebellar granule cells control (S−K+) and treated with low potassium (S−K−) for 4 h, in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Equal counts (5–10 × 106 cpm) of the cDNA probes from each treatment, (S−K+) and (S−K−), were heat-denatured and used to probe the duplicate blots. Once cDNA overexpression was confirmed by reverse Northern dot blot, we performed Northern blots to verify whether the selected cDNAs represent overexpression of a single mRNA. Northern blot experiments were also performed to study time course of NP1 expression. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Denatured RNA samples (20 μg of total RNA) from cerebellar granule cells controls (Sc+K+ and S−K+) and treated with low potassium (S−K−) were electrophoresed in 1.3% agarose and 0.66 m formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-XL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the RNA was fixed to the membranes by baking for 2 h at 80 °C. Hybridization with 32P-labeled probes and washing conditions were performed as described by the membrane manufacturer. Filters were exposed to BioMax films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with intensifying screens for 12–48 h at −80 °C. The NP1 probe used for Northern blot analysis corresponds to nucleotides 5127–5339 of the NP1 cDNA. The NP1 probe was obtained by PCR amplification of a positive clone identified by reverse Northern dot blot. The PCR product was electrophoresed in agarose and purified using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and 32P-labeled using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The β-actin probe was obtained by digestion of a pUC19 vector containing a 1.9-kilobase pair human β-actin insert between BamHI sites. Densitometric values of NP1 mRNA bands were obtained using Kodak DS1 computer software and were normalized with the densitometric values of the corresponding β-actin mRNA band. DNA sequencing was performed with Thermo-Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an ABI Prism 377 fluorescent sequencing instrument at the Serveis Cientı́fico Tècnics (University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain). Data base searches and sequence comparisons were performed using BLAST and BLASTX search servers at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). After the corresponding treatments, cerebellar granule cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and briefly sonicated. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Total protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The polypeptides were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blots were preincubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline before immunostaining. For specific immunodetection of NP1 protein, mouse anti-rat NP1 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA) and rabbit anti-rat polyclonal NP1 antibody (provided by Drs. Carsten Hopf and Paul Worley, Department of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD), were used at their appropriate concentrations in a solution containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk and 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Transduction Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA) or peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies. In addition to the measurement of the amount of protein before loading, we used a rabbit anti-actin antibody (Sigma) to control for the amount of protein loaded. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantification of the intensity of the bands on the films was performed with Kodak DS1 computer software. Densitometry values of the bands representing NP1 immunoreactivity were normalized with the values of the corresponding actin bands. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. Statistical significance of differences was examined using independent t tests or using one-way analysis of variance when required. Post hoc multiple comparisons were performed using Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Treatment of mature cerebellar granule cells with low potassium resulted in a time-dependent increase in neuronal death, measured with propidium iodide fluorescence (Fig.1). The loss of neurons was ∼60%, 24 h after switching from high to low extracellular concentration of potassium. In comparison, in the same time period, control cultures kept in conditioned medium containing serum and high potassium (Sc+K+) exhibited 13% cell death (Fig. 1). As additional controls, we used cultures in which conditioned medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with high (25 mm) potassium, but without serum (S−K+). In these cultures, cell death was 20% after 24 h of treatment. Serum removal did not have a significant effect on cell death until after 12 h of treatment. Moreover, after 24 h of treatment, cell death by serum removal was only 7% compared with undisturbed Sc+K+controls. Treatment with low potassium (5 mm) did not produce any significant cell death until after 8 h of treatment compared with controls. However, 24 h of exposure to low potassium (S−K−) induced 40% cell death, compared with exposure to serum-free medium containing high potassium (S−K+). To identify genes of the death program activated by low potassium before there is significant cell death, we investigated differential gene expression in cells treated with S−K+ and S−K− for 2 and 4 h. We chose these time points because they are well before any significant differences in cell death can be detected between these two treatments (Fig. 1). Moreover, previous studies have shown that cerebellar granule cells can be rescued from low potassium-induced cell death if RNA synthesis inhibitors are added within the first 4 h of treatment but not after (14Nardi N. Avidan G. Daily D. Zilkhafalb R. Barzilai A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify genes whose expression is induced before neuronal death, we systematically compared mRNA display patterns between cerebellar granule cells exposed to high potassium (S−K+), as controls, and cells treated with low potassium (S−K−). RNA from cultures treated with either S−K+ or S−K− was isolated after 2 and 4 h of treatment and subjected to differential gene display analysis.33P-labeled PCR was performed with 24 different 5′ arbitrary primers combined with each one of three different 3′-anchored primers, for a total of 72 different primer combinations. PCR reactions were performed in duplicate for each treatment group and time point. The analysis of differential gene expression was performed by comparing the band pattern of all these primer combinations for each treatment. We chose only those bands that showed a consistent differential expression, in both duplicates and in the two time points analyzed, between the two treatments. We found 102 bands that in both duplicates exhibited consistent differential expression between high and low potassium treatments at both 2 and 4 h of treatment. Among all of these, 62 bands indicated mRNA overexpression. We chose only those bands that exhibited at least a 4-fold higher densitometric intensity in low over high potassium treatments. We reamplified, subcloned, and sequenced the cDNA species from 12 bands that attained the criterion difference between high and low potassium treatments at both time periods. Finally, we isolated a cDNA band that showed overexpression after both 2 and 4 h of low potassium treatment, named AP21G1 (Fig. 2). To identify the cDNA fragment overexpressed in this band, several clones obtained from the reamplified cDNA from this band were subjected to reverse Northern dot blot (Fig. 3 A). Reverse Northern analysis showed that 4 out of 5 clones (AP21G1–1, -2, -3, and -5) obtained from the AP21G1 band exhibited higher signal when hybridized with cDNA from low potassium treated cultures than when hybridized with cDNA from control cultures (Fig. 3 A). This result indicates that these clones correspond to the gene whose overexpression was induced by treatment with low potassium and, therefore, the gene that confers the high intensity signal to the AP21G1 band (Fig. 2). PCR amplification of the inserts of the positive clones revealed a fragment of ∼200 base pairs in the four cDNAs. The sequence of the cDNA inserts of the four positive clones was identical, confirming that reverse Northern actually identified a single cDNA that was overexpressed in the AP21G1 band. The sequence of this cDNA overexpressed by low potassium treatment is 213 base pairs long and it is represented in Fig. 3 B. A search of the GenBank™ data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST program revealed that the AP21G1 fragment is 100% homologous with the 3′-untranslated region of rat NP1 mRNA (GenBank™ accession no. U18772) (22Schlimgen A.K. Helms J.A. Vogel H. Perin M.S.

Random homozygous knock-out (RHKO) is a retroviral-based antisense RNA strategy that can identify chromosomal genes whose functional disablement leads to reversible tumorigenic capabilities. Here we report that RHKO-induced Sam68 deficiency results in neoplastic transformation of murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Whereas simple haploinsufficiency of Sam68 produced by insertion mutagenesis in a single chromosomal allele did not detectably affect cell growth, reduction of Sam68 protein to <25% of the wild type level was associated with anchorage-independent growth, defective contact inhibition, and the ability to form metastatic tumors in nude mice. These properties were reversed by cessation of RHKO inactivation. Our findings, which indicate that the Sam68 protein level can prominently affect cell proliferation, implicate Sam68 function in tumorigenesis. Consistent with these results is evidence that cells undergoing mitosis show a dramatic reduction in the level of Sam68 protein.

The GSG domain is present in functionally diverse proteins that include theCaenorhabditis elegans germ line-specific tumor suppressor protein GLD-1 (18Jones A.R. Schedl T.

While genetic studies have implicated various KH domain and GSG domain proteins in development, differentiation, myelination, and tumorigenesis, the biological functions of Sam68 itself are unknown. Random homozygous knock-out (RHKO)1 is a retrovirus-based antisense RNA strategy devised to identify chromosomally located genes whose inactivation leads to a defined phenotype (25Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 26Liu K. Li L. Nisson P.E. Gruber C. Jessee J. Cohen S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3696-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This approach to the discovery of genes having functions of particular interest uses a regulated promoter within a randomly inserted chromosomally integrated retroviral gene search vector (GSV) to produce antisense transcripts complementary to those originating in the chromosomal gene bracketing the GSV. Since these antisense transcripts are also complementary to transcripts from other copies of the gene containing the GSV, the procedure can accomplish functional homozygous gene inactivation. Use of the β-geo reporter gene within the GSV allows the selection of GSV integration events in transcriptionally active genes and also the monitoring of antisense effects on chromosomally initiated transcripts. The antisense promoter is activated in trans by a gene whose subsequent deletion by site-specific recombination can reverse the antisense effects. We report here the discovery that homozygous functional inactivation ofSam68 in murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts leads to neoplastic transformation, as demonstrated by the ability of RHKO cells to reversibly form colonies in 0.5% agar and tumors in nude mice. We show that such RHKO-induced tumorigenesis is associated with Sam68 protein deficiency and also that a decrease in Sam68 protein level is a feature of cell mitosis. Procedures for NIH3T3 cell culture, transfection, RHKO, and assays for cell transformation and tumorigenesis have been described previously (25Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 26Liu K. Li L. Nisson P.E. Gruber C. Jessee J. Cohen S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3696-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The human glioblastoma cell line T98G was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For experiments where T98G cells were arrested in mitosis, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 12 h. Mitotic cells were collected and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. After mitotic cells were removed, attached cells were also lysed for analysis. Unsynchronous cells were defined as those that were not treated with any nocodazole but were incubated for same time period in complete medium before lysis. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, radicicol (Sigma; used at 20 μg/ml), or proteasome inhibitor, LLnL (Sigma; used at 40 μg/ml), was added, where indicated, together with nocodazole for 12 h prior to lysis to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation or ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, respectively. Polyadenylated mRNA was isolated from RHKO library cells in which the transactivator gene had been removed, and a cDNA library was constructed using the Life Technologies SuperScript®plasmid system. The first cDNA strand reaction was primed with an oligonucleotide (5′-GAC TAG TTC TAG ATC GCG AGC GGC CGC CCG CAT CGT AAC CGT GCA TCT-3′) that maps to the 5′ region of theβ-geo sequence. cDNAs were cloned into pCMVSPORT3.0, and fusions derived from transcripts containing the chromosomal Sam68 and gene search sequence were identified using the Gene Trapper® cDNA positive selection system (Life Technologies). To confirm the fusion of Sam68 and GSV transcript sequences, total RNA isolated from SKΔT2 was subjected to reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a specific forward primer for mouse Sam68 cDNA (5′-GTC GCT GTC GCT CCT GTT CTT CC-3′) and a specific reverse primer for the gene search vector (5′-GAT CCG CCA TGT CAC AGA TC-3′). Sam68 cDNAs were isolated by RT-PCR as described previously (26Liu K. Li L. Nisson P.E. Gruber C. Jessee J. Cohen S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3696-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Sam68-specific reverse primer was 5′-AGG TAC ACT GTT TAT ATT TA-3′, and the forward primer was 5′-GTC GCT GTC GCT CCT GTT CTT CC-3′. Cells were grown to 90% confluence, and whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40 or lgepa CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifty-μg amounts of these lysates were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations Inc.). The gels were run at 100 V for 10 h. Blots were probed with anti-Sam68 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and immunoreactive bands were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin (clone DM 1A; Sigma) as a loading control or with anti-c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-v-Src (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) monoclonal antibody. Anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase was used as the secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein levels were determined in three independent experiments by scanning autoradiograms of Western blots with Scanmaster 3TM (Howtek), which were analyzed using the Quality One program (pdi). Cells were seeded at a density of 0.7 × 105/ml in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. The live cells were counted daily using a hemacytometer. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells by standard procedures, and 25-μg samples were digested with specific restriction enzymes, subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking. The blots were probed with DNA fragments labeled by the random priming method. Using methods described previously (25Li L. Cohen S.N.

Antisense transcription from the pLLGSV-derived provirus into the flanking chromosomal DNA sequence was initiated by transfecting SK cells with pRSV-Cre, which leads to deletion of a DNA segment containing both LAP348 and an adjacent herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (25Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cells excising this segment were identified by their resistance to gancyclovir. Seven of 16 SK-derived gancyclovir-resistant subclones (i.e. SKΔT) no longer produced colonies in 0.5% agar, indicating that their anchorage-independent growth capabilities were reversible, whereas none of 20 individually tested untreated SK cell subclones showed reversal of anchorage-independent growth. SKΔT2, a randomly selected gancyclovir-resistant SK derivative whose ability to generate colonies on agar was lost after treatment with pRSV-Cre (Fig. 1 A, right; Table I) and whose deletion of the LAP348/thymidine kinase transactivator was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization using a LAP348 probe (data not shown), was selected for further study. Coincident with removal of the transactivator, production of β-galactosidase from theβ-geo reporter gene contained in the pLLGSV provirus (see Fig. 2 A) resumed, leading to dark blue staining of SKΔT2 cells by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Injection of SK cells subcutaneously into four athymic “nude” mice resulted in tumors at the sites of injection in all animals receiving these cells (Fig. 1 B) and pulmonary metastasis of a SK-derived tumor in one animal by the time of sacrifice. In contrast, the SK-derived SKΔT2 cell line, which had lost the ability to grow in soft agar following excision of the transactivator, did not generate detectable tumors in any of four injected animals (Fig. 1, Aand B; Table I). To identify the chromosomally encoded transcript sequence fused toβ-geo in the tumorigenic SK cell line, a cDNA library was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using as template poly(A)+ RNA obtained from a pool of SK-derived cells that lack the transactivator. Using a cDNA capture procedure (Gene Trapper®; Life Technologies) that employed an oligonucleotide sequence from theβ-geo 5′-end for capture, we isolated a cDNA derived from a 484-base pair transcript segment fused in frame to the pLLGSV splice acceptor site (SA) 5′ toβ-geo (Fig. 2 A). The sequence of this segment (Fig. 3 A) showed identity to nucleotides 1–482 of the previously reported exonic sequence of the murine Sam68 gene (7Richard S., Yu, D. Blumer K.J. Hausladen D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, an RT-PCR product made using total RNA from SKΔT2 cells as template and two sets of nested oligonucleotides corresponding toβ-geo and the 5′-end coding sequence ofSam68 as primers was found by Southern blotting and sequence analysis (Fig. 3 B) to correspond to aSam68/β-geo fusion transcript. In this transcript, a presumed splice donor site 187 nucleotides within the Sam68 coding sequence was fused to the splice acceptor site 5′ to β-geo (Fig. 3 A), consistent with previous evidence that Sam68 transcripts can undergo alternative splicing (22Barlat I.

Southern blot comparison of genomic DNAs from SK cells and the parental NIH3T3 cell line usingSam68 cDNA as probe provided direct confirmation at the DNA level that SK cells contain pLLGSV inserted within theSam68 gene (Fig. 3 C). Using primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of theSam68 coding sequence and total RNA obtained from SKΔT2 cells, we synthesized Sam68 cDNA by RT-PCR and cloned this cDNA in plasmid pCR3.1 (26Liu K. Li L. Nisson P.E. Gruber C. Jessee J. Cohen S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3696-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in the antisense direction behind the cytomegalovirus early gene promoter (25Li L. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1996; 85: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). An antisense cDNA construct isolated from a randomly selected bacterial clone was introduced into naive NIH3T3 cells, yielding a heterogeneous population of stably transfected cells containing chromosomal inserts at different locations. This population contained clones capable of anchorage-independent growth in 0.5% agar (Fig. 4; frequency, ∼0.5% of 105plated cells). Identically plated naive NIH3T3 cells receiving control constructs consisting of the vector alone showed no colony formation in agar. The low frequency of anchorage-independent growth observed in these transfectants suggests that insertion of the vector had occurred in a high percentage of cells at chromosomal locations where antisense RNA expression was insufficient to effectively inactivate sense RNA from both chromosomal alleles of Sam68. Western blots (Fig. 5 A and TableII) indicated that the native Sam68 protein is present in SK cells at approximately one-fourth the concentration observed for parental (NIH3T3) cells. The nontumorigenic revertant clone SKΔT2 and four randomly selected additional clones that, like SKΔT2, had undergone phenotypic reversion of tumorigenic capabilities following transfection by pRSV-Cre showed more than twice this level of Sam68, consistent with the observed reversal of RHKO. However, the Sam68 level in these clones remained at approximately one-half of normal, consistent with the presence of a resident pLLGSV proviral insert in one chromosomal allele (Fig. 5 A and TableII). The more rapidly migrating band detected by Sam68 antibody in both SK and SKΔT2 cells was associated with the presence of the GSV in these cells and may represent a splice variant. The irreversibility of tumorigenic capabilities in several other clones following introduction of Cre and a consequent increase in Sam68 suggests that neoplastic progression (see Refs. 29Nowell P.C.

This observation is reminiscent of earlier findings showing that the reintroduction of tumor suppressor gene function into cancer cells defective in these genes may not uniformly revert phenotypic abnormalities (33Nikitin A.Y.

The Sam68 decrease in SK cells was additionally associated with an increased rate of growth and defective contact inhibition. As shown in Fig. 5 B, during 5 days of culture SK cells grew to a cell density that was twice that attained by NIH3T3 cells plated at the same initial density. SKΔT2 cells showed growth characteristics similar to those of NIH3T3 cells.Table IIEffect of RHKO on intracellular Sam68 proteinCell linesSam68 (mean ± S.E.)α-Tubulin (mean ± S.E.)Sam68/α-Tubulin 2-aValues for Sam68/α-tubulin are shown in relative density units.CalculatedNormalizedNIH3T38.38 ± 0.423.91 ± 0.662.141.00SK2.70 ± 0.495.36 ± 0.580.500.23SKΔT26.37 ± 0.735.10 ± 0.611.250.58Autoradiograms of Western blots were scanned with Scanmaster 3™ (Howtek) and analyzed using the Quality One program (pdi).

Data represent averages of density traces of autoradiograms from three independent experiments. During mitosis, Sam68 interacts with and is phosphorylated by the Src tyrosine kinase, which itself undergoes mitosis-related phosphorylation at specific serine and threonine residues (40Shalloway D. Bagrodia S. Chackalaparampil I. Shenoy S. Lin P.H. Taylor S.J. Ciba Found Symp. 1992; 170: 248-265PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that induced Sam68 deficiency can affect cell proliferation led us to examine the Sam68 protein level during mitosis. The results of these experiments, which employed human glioblastoma cells, showed a dramatic decrease in Sam68 protein level in cells arrested in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole, compared with an unsynchronized actively dividing cell population (Fig. 6). This mitosis-associated decrease of Sam68, which Northern blot analysis showed is mediated post-transcriptionally (data not shown), was accompanied by a reciprocal increase in c-Src (Fig. 6). However, no alteration of either the intracellular concentration or the extent of phosphorylation of c-Src was observed in the tumorigenic SK line of mouse fibroblasts rendered deficient in Sam68 by RHKO, consistent with the earlier proposal that Sam68 acts downstream of c-Src (1Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 3Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Our results show that Sam68 deficiency can result in reversible tumorigenesis in NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts. Reduction of Sam68 protein to ∼25% of the wild type level was associated with colony formation in 0.5% agar, defective contact inhibition, and the ability to form metastatic tumors in nude mice. While there has been no previously reported evidence that Sam68 can modulate neoplastic transformation, the related GLD-1 protein is known to be a tumor suppressor in C. elegans (18Jones A.R. Schedl T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Sam68 is the only known mitotic target for the oncogenic tyrosine kinase Src, which interacts with and phophorylates Sam68 specifically during mitosis (1Taylor S.J. Shalloway D.

Although it has been speculated that Sam68 may have a role in linking the signaling pathways of Src and other Src family tyrosine kinases such as the threonine kinase, Cdc2, and the insulin receptor to downstream proteins or nuclear targets (5Resnick R.J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In the kidney, HGF is produced solely by the metanephric mesenchyme (6Sonnenberg E. Meyer D.

The Met receptor is expressed by metanephric mesenchyme as well as by the epithelium of the ureteric bud and later by S-shaped bodies and tubules. Neutralizing antibodies against HGF blocked branching morphogenesis by the ureteric bud in organ cultures of kidney rudiments and inhibited the early steps in branching morphogenesis by immortalized ureteric bud cells (UB cells) in three-dimensional organ culture (7Woolf A.S.

Antibodies against HGF, in addition to their effects on branching morphogenesis, inhibited glomerulogenesis and nephrogenesis. HGF is a member of the plasminogen family of serine proteases although it lacks proteolytic activity. Like other members of this group, it is secreted as an inactive zymogen that must be activated by proteolytic cleavage at Arg494-Val495 (9Naka D. Ishii T. Yoshiyama Y. Miyazawa K. Hara H. Hishida T.

A specific serine protease, HGF activator (HGFA), was purified from serum based on this biological activity and has been shown to mediate activation of HGF in injured tissues in vivo (13Miyazawa K.

Other serine proteases, including urokinase, factor XIIa, and tissue plasminogen activator have been shown to activate HGF in vitro, but their biologic role in HGF activation is unknown (11Naldini L.

Pathol. 1993; 143: 949-958PubMed Google Scholar). HGFA is expressed in adult liver and is secreted into the blood (14Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other serine proteases in the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades, HGF activator is secreted as an inactive single chain zymogen. It is cleaved to the catalytically active, disulfide-linked heterodimer by thrombin in vitro. The expression of HGFA during embryonic development is not known. HGF is required for embryonic development (17Uehara Y. Minowa O. Mori C. Shiota K. Kuno J. Noda T. Kitamura N. Nature. 1995; 373: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), so that activators of HGF must be expressed during embryogenesis. What might be the source of HGF activators in the developing metanephric kidney? The organ culture experiments that revealed a role for HGF in renal development contained no serum and hence no exogenous HGF activating activity. Therefore, the developing kidney must contain an endogenous HGF activator. A likely candidate for this activity is HGFA. To test the hypothesis that HGFA is responsible for HGF activation during fetal development, we cloned the murine homolog of the humanHGFA gene. In the earliest stage of renal development, message for HGFA was found only in microdissected ureteric bud and was not detected in mRNA extracted from the adjacent mesenchyme. Immortalized UB cells expressedHGFA message, protein, and an HGF hydrolyzing activity that was inhibited by a variety of serine protease inhibitors including leupeptin. UB cells scattered in response to the single chain zymogen of HGF; this scattering activity was inhibited by the same concentrations of leupeptin that blocked HGF activation. Leupeptin at concentrations that blocked the hydrolysis of HGF by ureteric budin vitro inhibited renal morphogenesis in organ culture. The inhibitory effect of leupeptin could be rescued by activated HGF. These data show that the activation of HGF in developing kidney is kidney autonomous and suggest that activation of HGF is regulated by ureteric bud secretion of HGFA. The coding sequence of human HGFA (GenBankTM accession number D50030) was used to screen the murine EST data base using the BLAST algorithm (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar). Sequences identified by the initial screen were used to re-interrogate the data base. By this process, 9 clones were identified and assembled into a contig. Five of these clones (mx85 g08, uc76a08, mj60f03, mw81a02, and ma52a08) were purchased from ATCC, characterized by restriction mapping, and sequenced in both directions. The sequence of murine HGFA was deposited in GenBankTM (AF224724). A 942-nucleotide EcoRI,NarI fragment of IMAGE clone mj60f03 corresponding to nucleotides 922 to 1864 of the full-length sequence was used as a probe. The probe was labeled with digoxigenin-UTP by random priming and used to screen mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH). For Northern blots of UB cell RNA, total RNA was isolated from UB cell cultures using RNAzol (Cinna) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was denatured and transferred to nylon membranes (Immobilon-N, Millipore). The membrane was hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C and washed with 0.1 × SSC containing 1% SDS at 65 °C. Bound probe was visualized with alkaline phosphatase and chemiluminescent detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RNA was isolated from murine UB cells or from microdissected rat ureteric buds and mesenchymes using RNAzol (Cinna). Poly(A) RNA from rat ureteric buds and mesenchymes was purified from total RNA by affinity chromatography on poly(dT) resin (Oligotex-dT, Qiagen). The microdissected rat kidney rudiments were obtained at embryonic day 13.5, when the ureteric bud had branched a single time. This stage of kidney development in the rat is morphologically equivalent to embryonic day 11.5 in murine kidney development. Primers for RT-PCR of murine HGFA were TGTTCAACCCCAACAACC (forward primer, nucleotides 1474–1491) and GTAAGCCACACCATTCTTCTC (reverse primer, nucleotides 1838–1818). Total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamers. The cDNA was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR using Taq polymerase (Promega). The annealing temperature was 59 °C for PCR with the murine template (UB cell RNA) and 54 °C for PCR with the rat template (dissected ureteric bud or mesenchyme RNA). Amplified DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using QIAEX resin (Qiagen) and directly sequenced by the DNA facility of Columbia University. UB cells (20Barasch J. Pressler L. Connor J. Malik A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F50-F60PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% ITS+ supplement (insulin, transferrin, selenous acid, essential fatty acids), from Fisher Scientific. Conditioned medium was obtained by washing confluent cultures of UB cells three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing no additives. The cells were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C, and washed again three times. Twenty-five ml of medium without additives were then incubated with confluent cultures in 150-cm2 flasks for 48 h to obtain conditioned medium. The conditioned medium was cleared by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min and concentrated 1000-fold with a Centricon Plus-80 Biomax-8 device (molecular mass cutoff 8000 daltons, Millipore). Mouse plasma and serum were purchased from Pelfreez. Activated HGF was obtained from R & D Systems (NSO HGF). The inactive zymogen of HGF (HGFsc) was a gracious gift of Dr. George vande Woude (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Antibodies raised against peptides derived from human HGFA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The peptide used to raise antibody HGFA-L (N-19) is identical in murine and human HGFA (underlined in Fig. 1). Antibodies against human HGF α subunit (N-19 and C-20), WT1 (C-19), and the HGF receptormet were also obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies. TROMA-1 was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rat IgG were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes. For some experiments, TROMA-1 antibodies were purified by anion exchange chromatography and labeled with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Blots were blocked for 1 h with 10% instant nonfat dry milk in PBS and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin. Concentrations of primary antibody were 1/100 for anti-HGF and 1/1000 for anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Met. Blots were washed 3 times in 5% milk and incubated for 45 min in 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Antibody binding was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Serial dilutions of UB conditioned medium were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 200 μg/ml single chain HGF (HGFsc). Aliquots of the mixture were removed at various times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Confluent cultures of UB cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium. The next day, HGFsc was added to the culture medium in the presence or absence of leupeptin or serum and the cultures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cultures were then washed three times in PBS and scraped in SB (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, Complete protease inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Triton X-100). The extracts were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and pelleted for 15 min at 10,000 × g to obtain cleared lysates. Lysates were incubated for 1 h with 1 μg of rabbit anti-Met and then for a second hour with Protein A-Sepharose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The precipitates were washed three times with SB and displayed on a 5% reducing SDS-PAGE. The immunoblots were processed for with anti-phosphotyrosine as described above except that the blots were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). After visualization of phosphotyrosine, the blots were stripped with 25 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and 1% SDS and then re-probed with anti-Met as described above. Kidney rudiments were dissected from timed pregnant Swiss Webster mice at E11.5 when the ureteric bud had branched once. Organs were explanted onto permeable supports (Transwell Clear, 3.0-μm pore size, Costar) in chambers containing 0.25 ml of medium. Cultures were maintained at the air-water interface in 5% CO2 for 96 h at 37 °C and then fixed for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C. Kidney rudiments were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 1% ITS+ (Collaborative Research) and no serum. For HGF and HGFA staining, explants of freshly dissected E12.5 kidneys were incubated for 3–4 h on Transwells and then processed for confocal microscopy. Methanol-fixed organ cultures were stained en bloc as described previously (21Huan Y. van Adelsberg J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fixed organ cultures were re-hydrated in PBS and blocked for 6 h in 1% bovine serum albumin or 10% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cultures were incubated in primary antibody for 24–48 h at 4 °C, washed for 8–24 h in 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated overnight in secondary antibody. The cultures were washed for 2–24 h, post-fixed for 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde, quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS, rinsed in PBS, and mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). The dilutions of primary antibody were: HGF (C-20 or N-19) 1:100, HGFA-L (N-19) 1:50, WT1 (C-19) 1:50, TROMA-1 1:10. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:100. Whole mounts were analyzed by confocal microscopy on a Zeiss 410 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon-krypton laser. The kidney rudiments were visualized with a × 10 or 40 objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 using the 568- and 488-nm laser emission peaks for excitation. Images were collected using a 515–540-nm band pass and a 590-nm long pass filter set. Each kidney rudiment was scanned 10 times 5-μm apart. The scans were recorded as TIFF files and used for image analysis as described previously (21Huan Y. van Adelsberg J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interrogation of the data base of murine ESTs with the coding sequence of human HGFA yielded 9 clones, of which one (mx85g08) contained the complete coding sequence of murine HGFA. One clone (uc76a08) had a 47-nucleotide out of frame deletion in the 5′ end. Clone mj60f03 contained the signal sequence which was followed by a 666-nucleotide in-frame deletion. The sequence of murine HGFA was 82% identical to that of human HGFA at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels (Fig.1). The catalytic domains of the two proteins were 93% identical, with 18 conservative amino acid substitutions and a single nonconservative substitution (Leu553 in mouse for Arg555 in human) in the COOH-terminal 257 amino acids. The thrombin cleavage site at Arg405-Ile406 that is required for activation of HGFA was conserved, as were all the amino acids required for catalytic activity. The fibronectin, epidermal growth factor, and Kringle domains were conserved as were the critical cysteines of all these motifs. The 104 amino acids at the amino-terminal end of the sequence were the least conserved, with 42 amino acid substitutions and 3 amino acid deletions in the murine relative to the human sequence. We used the murine HGFA sequence to search the GenBankTMdata base with the BLAST algorithm and identified only human HGFA and a partial rat HGFA sequence. A human protein similar to HGFA has recently been identified (22Sumiya J. Asakawa S. Tobe T. Hashimoto K. Saguchi K. Choi-Miura N.H. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Tomita M. J. Biochem.

( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AAB46909). This molecule, hyaluronin-binding protein, was only 38% identical to murine HGFA at the amino acid level. As our murine HGFA sequence is 82% identical to the human HGFA sequence, our sequence is murine HGFA, not the murine hyaluronin-binding protein. We probed Northern blots of mRNA isolated from fetal mice and a variety of adult mouse organs and found that HGFA was expressed only in adult mouse liver (Fig.2, A). This result is consistent with the previous finding that human HGFA was expressed only in adult liver by Northern blotting (14Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single transcript of 2.0 kb was detected in mouse liver, which contrasts with the situation in man, where a minor transcript of 3.4 kb was also detected. No HGFA was detected in Northern blots of total embryo poly(A) RNA. These data suggested that either HGFA is not expressed in the developing animal or that it is expressed in concentrations too low for detection by Northern blotting. In support of the latter hypothesis, we found that 7 of the 9 ESTs for murine HGFA were isolated from embryonic mouse libraries. We also identified human ESTs for HGFA in adult ovarian tumor (T72625), fetal liver/spleen (R89811), and a pooled adult lung/testis/B cell library (AI243638 and AA897612), suggesting that HGFA is expressed at low levels in a variety of organs during fetal and adult life in man. To test the hypothesis that HGFA is expressed during kidney development, we screened poly(A) RNA isolated from microdissected rat ureteric buds and mesenchymes by RT-PCR. We found that the predicted 345-base pair fragment was consistently amplified from the ureteric bud but not from the mesenchyme (Fig. 2,C). Treatment of RNA with DNase prior to reverse transcription and PCR did not abolish amplification of this fragment. However, treatment of the samples with RNase blocked amplification. The amplified fragment was purified and sequenced. The sequence was similar, but not identical, to the sequence of murine HGFA. In the area where the fragment overlapped with a partial rat HGFA sequence (GI:3116329), the sequence was identical to the rat sequence. Thus, the amplified fragment arose from rat RNA and could not have been derived from contamination by murine HGFA plasmid DNA. These data show that, during early renal development, HGFA is expressed exclusively by the ureteric bud. To further characterize HGFA in ureteric bud epithelial cells, we screened an immortalized ureteric bud cell line (UB cells) for HGFA expression. The predicted 345-base pair fragment was amplified from UB cell RNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 2, C, UB cells). The sequence of this fragment was identical to the murine HGFA sequence. A single transcript of 2.0 kb was identified in UB RNA by Northern blotting using our murine HGFA probe (Fig. 2, B). These data support the results of the RT-PCR analysis of isolated ureteric buds and mesenchymes and show that ureteric bud epithelial cells express HGFA both in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether UB cells synthesized and secreted HGFA protein, we probed immunoblots of conditioned medium from UB cells with antibodies to HGFA. Antibody HGFA-L (N-19) was raised against a peptide at the amino-terminal end of the 34-kDa catalytic subunit of HGFA (underlined in Fig. 1). It recognized polypeptides of 99 and 34 kDa in murine plasma, representing the intact, uncleaved high molecular mass zymogen of HGFA (99 kDa) and the 34-kDa catalytically active form (Fig. 3 A). Only the 34-kDa catalytically active form was detected in serum (Fig.3 A) and in UB cell conditioned medium (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that UB cells are capable not only of secreting but also of activating HGFA. We examined the distribution of HGFA in early kidney rudiments by confocal microscopy of whole mounts of freshly isolated E12.5 kidneys. We found that HGFA protein was expressed in the ureteric bud, as shown by the orange staining indicating colocalization of HGFA (green) and the ureteric bud marker (TROMA-1, red, arrowhead in Fig. 4 A) (24Piepenhagen P.A. Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Nelson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1417-C1432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mesenchyme, HGFA was localized in a reticular pattern extending 2 to 3 cell diameters from the ureteric bud surface, consistent with deposition of HGFA, a heparin-binding protein (13Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3615-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), in the extracellular matrix surrounding the mesenchymal cells adjacent to the ureteric bud (arrows, Fig. 4 A). Staining was specific for HGFA, as co-incubation of the antibody with the immunizing peptide blocked HGFA labeling but not labeling with the antibody for the ureteric bud specific cytokeratin, TROMA-1 (Fig.4 B). Single optical sections suggested that HGFA was concentrated around the ureteric bud tips (Fig. 4 A). To test this hypothesis, serial optical sections of a kidney rudiment stained for HGFA were optically summed and projected onto a single plane. These images were displayed with a pseudocolor algorithm to show the relative intensity of HGFA staining throughout the rudiment (Fig. 4 C). HGFA immunoreactivity was concentrated around the ampulla of the ureteric bud, shown outlined in white. The distribution of HGFA was different from the distribution of HGF (Fig. 4 D). HGF was localized throughout the mesenchyme and was not concentrated around the ureteric bud ampulla. This result shows that the high concentration of HGFA around the ureteric bud is not an artifact of the high local concentration of mesenchymal cells around the ureteric bud. The identification of a 34-kDa form of HGFA in UB conditioned medium suggested that UB cells secrete and activate HGFA. To test this hypothesis, we incubated the uncleaved zymogen of HGF (HGFsc) with serial dilutions of conditioned medium. HGFsc was completely converted to the active heterodimer (HGFα and HGFβ) by 2.4 μg of protein from UB conditioned medium (Fig.5 A). These data show that UB cells secrete HGFA and hydrolyze HGFsc to a disulfide-linked heterodimer. The molecular weights of the HGF subunits produced by UB conditioned medium are consistent with activation of HGF by hydrolysis between Arg494 and Val495. HGFA is a serine protease whose HGF hydrolyzing activity is blocked by the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin and the serine and cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin, but not by the acid protease inhibitor pepstatin or the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin (10Gak E.

Two or three rudiments were analyzed for each experiment, ±S.E. Activated HGF binds to the Met receptor tyrosine kinase and increases cell motility, producing scattering of islands of HGF-responsive cells in two-dimensional culture. To discover whether the HGF hydrolyzing enzyme secreted by UB cells produced functionally active, heterodimeric HGF from the inactive zymogen (HGFsc), we incubated UB cells with HGFsc in the presence or absence of leupeptin. In serum-free medium without HGF, UB cells were closely associated in islands with smooth borders (Fig. 6, A, no HGF). Activated, heterodimeric HGF produced scattering (Fig. 6,A, activated HGF) as did an equal concentration of HGFsc (Fig. 6, scHGF). The scattering activity of HGFsc was inhibited by 100 and 10 μm leupeptin (Fig. 6 A,100 μm leupeptin and 10μm leupeptin. Note that the UB cells were viable after incubation even in high concentrations of leupeptin (100 μm, Fig. 6 A).) These data show that UB cells responded to HGFsc in a leupeptin-dependent manner. To demonstrate further that UB cells produced the activated form of HGF from the inactive zymogen HGFsc, the HGF receptor met was immunoprecipitated from cultures of UB cells (Fig. 6 B).

In this study, we have identified alternative GLI1 transcripts that differ in their 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and are generated by exon skipping. These are denoted α-UTR, β-UTR, and γ-UTR according to the number of noncoding exons possessed (three, two, and one, respectively). The α- and β-UTR forms represent the major Gli1 transcripts expressed in mouse tissues, whereas the γ-UTR is present at relatively low levels but is markedly induced in mouse skin treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. Transcripts corresponding to the murine β and γ forms were identified in human tissues, but significantly, only the γ-UTR form was present in basal cell carcinomas and in proliferating cultures of a keratinocyte cell line. Flow cytometry analysis determined that the γ-UTR variant expresses a heterologous reporter gene 14–23-fold higher than the α-UTR and 5–13-fold higher than the β-UTR in a variety of cell types. Because expression of the γ-UTR variant correlates with proliferation, consistent with a role for GLI1 in growth promotion, up-regulation of GLI1 expression through skipping of 5′ noncoding exons may be an important tumorigenic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2169268397,"Interleukin-16 (IL-16) is a pleiotropic cytokine that functions as a chemoattractant factor, a modulator of T cell activation, and an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. These diverse functions are exclusively attributed to the secreted C-terminal peptide of 121 amino acids (mature IL-16), which is cleaved from the precursor protein (pro-IL-16) by caspase-3. Human pro-IL-16 is comprised of 631 amino acids with three PDZ domains, one of which is present in secreted mature IL-16. No cellular localization or biologic functions have been ascribed to the unusually large and highly conserved N-terminal prodomain formed as a result of proteolytic release of the third PDZ domain of pro-IL-16. Here we show that the N-terminal prodomain of pro-IL-16 translocates into the nucleus following cleavage of the C-terminal segment. The nuclear localization signal of pro-IL-16 consists of a classical bipartite nuclear targeting motif. We also show that the nuclear targeting of the IL-16 prodomain induces a G0/G1 arrest in the cell cycle. Taken together, the high degree of conservation of the prodomain among species, the presence of two PDZ motifs, and the nuclear localization and subsequent inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression suggest that pro-IL-16 is cleaved into two functional proteins, a C-terminal-secreted cytokine and an N-terminal product, which affects the cell cycle.

IL-16 functions also as a modulator of T cell activation (3Theodore A.C. Center D.M. Nicoll J. Fine G. Kornfeld H. Cruikshank W.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1958-1964PubMed Google Scholar) and as an inhibitor of HIV-1 replication (4Baier M. Werner A. Bannert N. Metzner K. Kurth R.

Control of IL-16 expression occurs at both transcriptional and translational levels (7Baier M. Bannert N. Werner A. Lang K. Kurth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In particular, secreted IL-16 comprises the 121 C-terminal amino acids of the larger intracellular precursor protein following cleavage by caspase-3 (8Zhang Y. Center D.M. Wu D.M.H. Cruikshank W.W. Yuan J. Andrews D.W. Kornfeld H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1144-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Mature IL-16 is unusual in that it contains one of the three PDZ domains present in the C-terminal half of pro-IL-16. There are few, if any, examples of secreted PDZ-containing proteins. There is very high cross species homology of the entire pro-IL-16, including the N-terminal prodomain, which results from caspase-3 cleavage of the mature secreted cytokine (9Keane J. Nicoll J. Kim S. Wu D.M. Cruikshank W.W. Brazer W. Natke B. Zhang Y. Center D.M. Kornfeld H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5945-5954PubMed Google Scholar). Along with the high interspecies homology, the presence of two additional PDZ domains in the prodomain suggests that pro-IL-16 might have intracellular functions in addition to serving as a precursor of the secreted cytokine. The distribution pattern of a protein within the cell can provide important clues to its function. As the first step toward understanding the function of pro-IL-16, we used fluorescence immunochemistry to study the intracellular distribution of this protein. COS cell expression systems were used to provide detailed characterization of subcellular localization of pro-IL-16 and its N-terminal prodomain after proteolytic processing. Previously published data have shown that COS cells do not express endogenous IL-16 but are able to express and process pro-IL-16 via endogenous caspase-3 following cDNA transfection (8Zhang Y.

This processing results in the extracellular release of biologically active mature IL-16, thus mimicking the natural secretory processes previously noted in T cells. Our data demonstrate that in transfected COS cells, pro-IL-16 is distributed in the cytoplasm and is concentrated in the perinuclear region. Following caspase-3 cleavage the remaining N-terminal prodomain translocates to the nucleus. Nuclear localization of IL-16 prodomain in transfected COS cells has a negative effect on cell growth. Pro-IL-16 cDNA was subcloned into vector pXM (Genetics Institute). An N-terminal GFP pro-IL-16 fusion construct was produced by inserting the GFP coding sequence from pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) into pXM-pro-IL-16 using the 5′-KpnI site in the vector and a 3′-BsrGI site introduced after the first methionine of pro-IL-16 by polymerase chain reaction. For the FLAG-tagged constructs, we used polymerase chain reaction to add the FLAG sequence to either the N- or C-terminal of pro-IL-16 either after the first methionine or right before the stop codon, respectively. Truncated pro-IL-16 constructs were created using recombination polymerase chain reaction to delete the selected portion of pro-IL-16 as listed in Fig. 3 A and cloned back into the pXM vector. All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. For the immunoblotting experiments, transfections were performed, and cells were collected as described previously (8Zhang Y. Center D.M. Wu D.M.H.

For the immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were plated on chamber slides 24 h before transfection.

For immunohistochemistry, only the anti-FLAG antibody was used. Briefly, 48 h after transfection, cells growing on the chamber slides were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing twice with PBS, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed twice with PBS, and were then incubated with 5% milk and 50 μg/ml normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. After removing the blocking milk, the cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed three times (5 min each) with PBS/Tween (0.05%) before incubation with rhodamine-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:500) in 1% milk for 1 h. The slides were then washed two times with PBS/Tween, the chamber and gasket were disassembled, the slides were washed once more with PBS/Tween, and were finally rinsed with distilled water. After removal of excess water the slides were mounted with Pro Long antifade solution (Molecular Probes) covered with coverslips and sealed with nail polish. Slides were examined either with confocal microscopy or an Axioplan microscope (Zeiss) with a × 40 objective. Images of cells were captured using 400 ASA slide film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, COS cells grown in P100 plates were harvested by trypsin treatment and resuspended in ice-cold PBS. Cells were rinsed two times with cold PBS prior to incubation with Buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 300 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl and the protease inhibitors aprotinin, chymostatin, antipain, and pepstatin at 10 μg/ml) on ice for 15 min. 20 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added into the 400-μl cell suspension and hand-mixed for 10 s. The sample was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C using a desk-top microcentrifuge to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was further fractionated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction of this centrifugation was collected and classified as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with ice-cold PBS before adding 50 μl of Buffer II (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 350 mm KCl, 25% glycerol and the protease inhibitors aprotinin, chymostatin, antipain, and pepstatin at 10 μg/ml) to lyse the nuclei. After a 15-min incubation on ice, nuclear lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and this supernatant fraction was classified as nuclear. The protein concentration in each fraction was determined using Bio-Rad bovine gamma globulin as standard protein and Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. 5 × 106 COS cells were washed with PBS buffer and fixed in 80% ethanol on ice for 1 h. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS twice before resuspension in RNase A (100 μg/ml)/PIB (propidium iodide staining buffer: PBS buffer with the addition of 0.12% Triton X-100 and 0.12 mmEDTA) for 45 min at 37 °C. PI solution (5 mg/ml propidium iodide dissolved in PIB) was added at 50 μg/ml, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature in the dark for at least 1 h. The analysis was performed on the day of the assay using a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Schematic representations of the wild-type pro-IL-16 and a construct of the full-length 80-kDa pro-IL-16 with a GFP-fused N-terminal and a FLAG-tagged C-terminal (GFP·80·FLAG) are shown in Fig. 1 A. Expression and natural processing of the GFP·80·FLAG protein in the transfected COS cells were compared with wild-type pro-IL-16 by Western blot of the transfected COS cell lysate probed with anti-IL-16 antibody (Fig. 1 B). The Western analysis demonstrates that pro-IL-16 is processed normally in COS cells, justifying the use of this system to explore the fate of pro-IL-16 after cleavage. Double immunofluorescence confocal microscopic analysis of COS cells transfected with the GFP·80·FLAG construct revealed that the GFP green fluorescence localized to both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.2 A). In contrast, staining with a rhodamine-labeled anti-FLAG antibody localized red fluorescence in the cytoplasm only (Fig. 2 B). An overlay of green and red fluorescent images is shown in Fig. 2 C, where the double exposure shows the coincidence of green N-terminal signal and red C-terminal signal as yellow. Specific immunofluorescent staining of pro-IL-16 was confirmed by phase contrast imaging of untransfected COS cells (Fig. 2 D, arrowhead). The differential distribution of red versus green fluorescence of pro-IL-16 in the GFP·80·FLAG-transfected COS cells suggests that the full-length pro-IL-16 protein is localized in the COS cell cytoplasm, particularly concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear region (the reticular pattern of yellow fluorescence resulted from the overlay of Fig. 2, A and B). After cleavage, the N-terminal prodomain of pro-IL-16 appears to translocate into the nucleus (the nuclear staining of green fluorescence) and C-terminal fragment of active IL-16 appears to remain in the cytoplasm (the cytoplasmic distribution of red fluorescence) prior to secretion. To confirm the hypothesis suggested by the experiments depicted in Fig.2, as well as to identify the region responsible for nuclear targeting, we made three selectively truncated pro-IL-16 constructs with N-terminal FLAG tags (Fig.3 A). These constructs produce: 1) a protein truncated at the C terminus after amino acid 510 (60 kDa), which constitutes the N-terminal prodomain of IL-16 following caspase-3 cleavage of pro-IL-16; 2) a protein truncated at the N terminus before residue 511 (20 kDa), which constitutes secreted IL-16; and 3) a protein that is truncated at both N and C termini before residue 258 and after residue 510 (30 kDa) (Fig. 3 A). The authenticity of the protein products of the above constructs was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the transfected COS cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the sizes of these truncated proteins of pro-IL-16 were in agreement with the predicted molecular masses. Immunofluorescence analyses of COS cells transfected with 60- and 20-kDa constructs confirmed the double-stained confocal images of pro-IL-16. Specifically, the N-terminal portion of pro-IL-16 (60-kDa prodomain) translocated into the nucleus (Fig.4 A), and the C-terminal mature IL-16 (20 kDa) remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these data suggest that in the transfected COS cells, the prodomain of IL-16 translocates to the nucleus following cleavage of C-terminal bioactive IL-16. The cytoplasmic fluorescent staining of COS cells transfected with the 30-kDa construct (Fig. 4 C) implies that the nuclear localization signal of pro-IL-16 is located in the N-terminal first 257 amino acid residues of pro-IL-16. Knowing the N-terminal region of pro-IL-16 between amino acid 1 and 257 is responsible for nuclear targeting, we next searched the sequence of pro-IL-16 to see whether there were any consensus nuclear-targeting motifs. One basic region that could function as a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was found between amino acids 79 and 101 (79KKGPPVAPKPAWFRQSLKGLRNR101). Similar bipartite motifs have been found in many nuclear proteins and serve as consensus sequences for nuclear targeting (11Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). To evaluate the nuclear localization properties of this NLS, we performed mutagenesis to change all five basic amino acids into alanines (indicated as underlined) at the both N and C termini of this NLS (79AAGPPVAPKPAWFRQSLAGLANA101). As shown in Fig. 5, the NLS-mutated prodomain of pro-IL-16 shows reduced nuclear-targeting activity (60 kDa NLSM), when compared with nonmutated protein (60 kDa NLSW). To determine whether the prodomain of pro-IL-16 localized to the nucleus has an effect on cell growth, we performed cell cycle analysis on transfected COS cells. To facilitate flow cytometric cell cycle analysis in transiently transfected cells, we made new pro-IL-16 wild-type and NLS mutant constructs with an N-terminal-fused GFP reporter (Fig. 6 A). As a control for the effects of nuclear GFP, we made a construct that fused an NLS sequence from human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) tax protein to GFP (NLS·GFP). To investigate nuclear targeting of the NLS mutant of pro-IL-16 and confirm the distribution of expressed proteins, subcellular fractionation was performed following transfection of COS cells with plasmid GFP constructs; NLS·GFP, GFP·60, or GFP·60-NLSM. Immunoblots of the transfected COS cells with anti-GFP antibody demonstrate that the IL-16 prodomain with mutated NLS (GFP·60-NLSM) shows greatly reduced nuclear targeting activity (TableI and Fig. 6 B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). The integrity of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were confirmed by stripping and reprobing the blot with an anti-tubulin antibody as an indication of nuclear fraction free of the contamination of cytoplasmic proteins (Fig. 6 B, bottom panel). As shown in Table I and Fig. 6 B, in the transfected COS cells GFP is exclusively located in the cytoplasm; NLS·GFP is exclusively located in the nucleus; and the wild-type prodomain of IL-16 (GFP·60) distribute equally both in the cytoplasm and nucleus.Table IIntracellular distribution of GFP and GFP fusion proteinsCOS cells transfected with construct ofPercentage of expressed protein1-aProteins were quantified by densitometric analysis of Western blot. in the cytoplasmPercentage of expressed protein1-aProteins were quantified by densitometric analysis of Western blot. in the nucleus%GFP99.30.7NLS·GFP0.199.9GFP·6046.653.4GFP·60-NLSM77.023.01-a Proteins were quantified by densitometric analysis of Western blot. Open table in a new tab Forty-eight hours after transfecting COS cells with the above constructs, the cells were collected and stained with propidium iodide and then analyzed by flow cytometry to identify transfected cells (GFP-positive). The cell cycle profile of the transfected COS cells (gated on green fluorescent-positive cells) revealed that overexpression of the wild-type prodomain of IL-16 (Fig.7, GFP60), but not NLS mutant (Fig. 7, GFP60 NLSM), induced an accumulation of the cells in G0/G1 phase (TableII). Cell cycle analysis of cells transfected with an independent NLS linked to GFP (Fig. 7, NLS GFP) had a similar G0/G1 profile to GFP alone transfected cells (Fig. 7, GFP) as well as untransfected cells (not shown). Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that ∼40% of GFP or NLS·GFP-transfected cells were in G0/G1, whereas ∼53% of GFP·60-transfected cells remained in G0/G1phase (Table II). There is ∼13% G0/G1 arrest in COS cells overexpressing GFP·60 compared with GFP or NLS·GFP. By contrast, only 41% of GFP·60-NLSM transfected COS cells were in the G0/G1 phase, and COS cells that expressed this mutant protein had a similar cell cycle profile as those cells that expressed GFP or NLS·GFP (Table II). We confirmed these studies by transfection of the same expression vectors in 3T3 cells (data not shown).Table IINuclear targeting of IL-16 prodomain effects on cell cycleConstructG0/G1SG2/MGFP39.70 ± 0.4927.13 ± 4.4733.17 ± 1.97NLS·GFP39.41 ± 2.3827.86 ± 1.4332.73 ± 3.83GFP·6052.85 ± 1.5521.02 ± 1.4826.14 ± 0.06GFP·60-NLSM41.26 ± 3.2625.64 ± 0.0633.10 ± 3.20COS cells were transfected with constructs GFP, NLS·GFP, GFP·60, or GFP·60-NLSM.

Open table in a new tab COS cells were transfected with constructs GFP, NLS·GFP, GFP·60, or GFP·60-NLSM. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Mean % values from three experiments are shown. The autofluorescent (GFP fusion) and immunofluorescent (FLAG tag) localization studies suggest that in transfected COS cells, the N-terminal prodomain of IL-16 translocates into the nucleus following cleavage and release of the C-terminal bioactive IL-16. Using site-directed mutagenesis we were able to identify a putative NLS of pro-IL-16 between amino acids 79 and 101. However, the current studies did not demonstrate whether other sequences in pro-IL-16 might also contribute to the nuclear import. Our cell fractionation results of COS cells transfected with wild-type or NLS-mutated pro-IL-16 constructs correlated with the fluorescent immunohistochemistry results and confirmed the nuclear localization properties of the prodomain of IL-16. The function of pro-IL-16 in the nucleus appears to be cell growth-related as nuclear translocation of the prodomain results in G0/G1 arrest. Our data suggest that the 80 kDa primary pro-IL-16 translation product could have two distinct functions after caspase-3 processing. The C-terminal segment of pro-IL-16 is a secreted protein that acts as a typical cytokine. The remaining N-terminal prodomain of IL-16 translocates to the nucleus after release of C-terminal polypeptide where it may influence cell cycle regulation. A similar phenomenon has been reported for IL-1α. Pro-IL-1α is released by caspase-1 cleavage and appears to affect cell growth (12Stevenson F.T. Turck J. Locksley R.M. Lovett D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). IL-16 and IL-1α share some general similarities. They are both processed by caspase family enzymes. Neither secreted mature cytokine has a secretory leader sequence, and following caspase enzyme processing their remaining prodomains translocate to the nucleus. However, unlike the negative effect we observed with N-terminal prodomain of IL-16, the N-terminal prodomain of IL-1α has been reported to function as a transforming nuclear oncoprotein (12Stevenson F.T. Turck J. Locksley R.M. Lovett D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Pro-IL-16 contains multiple PDZ domains. Proteins with PDZ motifs often function in intracellular signal transduction (13Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and in structures at plasma membrane (14Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 15Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Pro-IL-16 of lymphocyte origin contains one putative cdc2 kinase substrate site (56TPPK59), which lies N-terminal to the nuclear localization sequence. The sequence 56TPPK59 is similar to the consensus sequence that is phosphorylated by the mitotic cdc2 kinase or H1 kinase (16Langan T.A. Gautie J. Lohka M. Hollingsworth R. Moreno S. Nurse P. Maller J. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3860-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The cdc2 kinase motif suggests a way that nuclear pro-IL-16 might participate in cell cycle control. Along these lines, several PDZ domain-containing proteins have been found to localize in the nucleus (17Poulat F. Barbara P.S. Desclozeaux M. Soullier S. Moniot B. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Berta P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7167-7172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Osada H. Hasada K. Inazawa J. Uchida K. Ueda R. Takahashi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 582-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) although their functions are not completely understood. It is unclear how full-length unprocessed pro-IL-16 remains predominantly in the transfected COS cells cytoplasm, whereas the prodomain translocates to the nucleus. Extranuclear sequestration mechanisms for regulating entry of proteins into the nucleus have been reported for many transcription factors, such as NF-kB (19Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, Ref. 20Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), and certain steroid hormone receptors. In each of these cases the entry of protein into nucleus is a regulated event. In the case of SREBP-1 and -2, nuclear entry is controlled by the proteolytic processing of the C-terminal segment bound to the endoplasmic reticular membrane (20Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). However, overcoming an existing nuclear exporting signal controls entry of other nuclear proteins. LIMK-1, a protein serine/threonine kinase concentrates in the nucleus after deletion of a C-terminal portion of PDZ domain, which contains two nuclear exporting signals (21Yang N. Higuchi O. Mizuno K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The perinuclear localization of pro-IL-16 prior to cleavage suggests an element in the C terminus (perhaps the PDZ domain) may bind to a perinuclear protein. Once cleaved from the third PDZ domain, the released N-terminal prodomain is free to translocate into the nucleus. However, any of the previously noted mechanisms might regulate translocation of the prodomain of IL-16 into the nucleus. The cellular localization and the biological function of pro-IL-16 in human T lymphocytes are currently under investigation. We thank Dr. Matthew J. Fenton and Dr. Zhixiong Xiao for many helpful discussions and Terry K. Means and William F. Brazer for technical assistance."

Here, we identified a minimal RNA element in the 3'-UTR, which acts as a cis-acting element of structure-anchored repression (CAESAR). Deletion analyses of the 3'-UTR led us to minimize the element of 84 bases at the junction of the coding region and the 3'-UTR. The minimized RNA segment is predicted, and actually capable of forming a stable secondary structure in vitro. Mutational analyses disclosed a significant relationship between the predicted structure and repressive effect. The utility of CAESAR as a post-transcriptional regulatory element was represented by the fact that steady-state mRNA levels were not affected by CAESAR linked in cis, while protein levels from such a chimeric gene were markedly reduced. Of note, the CAESAR sequence exerted no effect, when it was placed upstream of the promoter. Finally, RNA gel electromobility-shift analyses demonstrated a nuclear factor that interacts with the folded CAESAR. Taken together, it was uncovered that CAESAR of ctgf is a novel post-transcriptional structured RNA regulatory element, probably acting through direct interactions with a nuclear factor as observed in retroviral RNA elements with certain proteins."

The mutation DIPEN(341) to DIGSA(341) partially blocked cleavage by MMP-13 and MMP-8 at the MMP site, while the mutation (342)FFGVG to (342)GTRVG completely blocked cleavage at this site by MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -13, -14. Each of the MMP cleavage site mutants, including a four-amino acid deletion mutant lacking residues ENFF(343), were efficiently cleaved by aggrecanase, suggesting that the primary sequence at the MMP site had no effect on aggrecanase activity in the IGD. The mutation (374)ARGSV to (374)NVYSV completely blocked cleavage at the aggrecanase site by aggrecanase, MMP-8 and atrolysin C but had no effect on the ability of MMP-8 and MMP-13 to cleave at the Asn(341) downward arrowPhe bond. Susceptibility to atrolysin C cleavage at the MMP site was conferred in the DIGSA(341) mutant but absent in the wild-type, (342)GTRVG, (374)NVYSV, and deletion mutants. To further explore the relationship between MMP and aggrecanase activities, sequential digest experiments were done in which MMP degradation products were subsequently digested with aggrecanase and vice versa. Aggrecanase-derived G1 domains with ITEGE(373) C termini were viable substrates for MMPs; however, MMP-derived G2 fragments were resistant to cleavage by aggrecanase. A 10-mer peptide FVDIPENFFG, which is a substrate analogue for the MMP cleavage site, inhibited aggrecanase cleavage at the Glu(373) downward arrowAla bond. This study demonstrates that MMPs and aggrecanase have unique substrate recognition in the IGD of aggrecan and suggests that sequences at the C terminus of the DIPEN(341) G1 domain may be important for regulating aggrecanase cleavage."

KSHV-GPCR contains the amino acid sequence Val-Arg-Tyr rather than the Asp/Glu-Arg-Tyr ((D/E)RY) motif at the intracellular end of TMH3. Mutation of Arg-143 to Ala (R143A) or Gln (R143Q) abolished constitutive signaling whereas R143K exhibited 50% of the basal activity of KSHV-GPCR. R143A was not stimulated by agonist, whereas R143Q was stimulated by growth-related oncogene-α, and R143K, similar to KSHV-GPCR, was stimulated further. These findings show that Arg-143 is critical for signal generation in KSHV-GPCR. In other GPCRs, Arg in this position may act as a signaling switch by movement of its sidechain from a hydrophilic pocket in the TMH bundle to a position outside the bundle. In rhodopsin, the Arg of Glu-Arg-Tyr interacts with the adjacent Asp to constrain Arg outside the TMH bundle. V142D was 70% more active than KSHV-GPCR, suggesting that an Arg residue, which is constrained outside the bundle by interacting with Asp-142, leads to a receptor that signals more actively. Because the usually conserved Asp in the middle of TMH2 is not present in KSHV-GPCR, we tested whether Asp-83 at the intracellular end of TMH2 was involved in signaling. D83N and D83A were 110 and 190% more active than KSHV-GPCR, respectively. The double mutant D83A/V142D was 510% more active than KSHV-GPCR. That is, cosubstitutions of Asp-83 by Ala and Val-142 by Asp act synergistically to increase basal signaling. A model of KSHV-GPCR predicts that Arg-143 interacts with residues in the TMH bundle and that the sidechain of Asp-83 does not interact with Arg-143.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus G protein-coupled receptor transmembrane helix polymerase chain reaction Hank's balanced saline solution HEPES HBSS growth-related oncogene-α inositol phosphate Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)1 (human herpesvirus 8) is a γ-herpesvirus that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma, and a subset of multicentric Castleman's disease (1Nador R.G.

Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4 (419): 419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A G protein-coupled receptor (KSHV-GPCR) is encoded within the genome of KSHV (3Cesarman E. Nador R.G. Bai F.

It has been shown that KSHV-GPCR exhibits constitutive signaling via the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C pathway (5Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). When expressed in mouse fibroblasts, KSHV-GPCR stimulates cell proliferation, causes transformation, and promotes angiogenesis mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (6Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Recently, expression of this viral receptor was shown to induce the formation of angioproliferative lesions in transgenic mice that were similar to the lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (7Yang T.-Y. Chen S.-C. Leach M.W. Manfra D. Homey B. Wiekowski M. Sullivan L. Jenh C.-H. Narula S.K. Chensue S.W. Lira S.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because persistently activated GPCRs can function as human tumor genes (8Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Gershengorn M.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 27-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we suggested that the constitutive signaling activity of KSHV-GPCR may play an important role in KSHV-induced tumorigenesis (9Cesarman E. Mesri E.A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Understanding the details of KSHV-GPCR structure that cause constitutive signaling, therefore, may allow for the design of drugs to treat KS and primary effusion lymphoma. In a previous report (10Ho H.H. Du D. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31327-31332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that the amino-terminal extracellular domain of KSHV-GPCR may serve as a “tethered ligand” that constitutively activates the receptor. Although we found that the amino terminus was important for high affinity binding of chemokines, we showed that the amino terminus was not important for constitutive signaling. This observation was recently confirmed (11Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Holst P.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26309-26315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, other domains within KSHV-GPCR are involved in causing the receptor to signal constitutively. Rosenkilde et al. (11Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Holst P.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26309-26315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) identified residues at the extracellular loop/fifth transmembrane helix (TMH5) and TMH6 boundaries, which when mutated decreased agonist stimulation and residues in TMH2, which when mutated decreased basal signaling. We sought to identify additional domains within KSHV-GPCR that cause the receptor to signal constitutively. In particular, we were interested in discovering mutations that could lead to increased basal signaling so as to use computer models of these receptors to delineate the structural changes that constitute KSHV-GPCR activation. The highly conserved amino acid sequence, Asp/Glu-Arg-Tyr ((D/E)RY), at the intracellular end of TMH3 of other GPCRs of the rhodopsin family has been shown to be important in receptor activation. It was initially shown that the charged pair of Glu-Arg was needed for rhodopsin activation because double mutants of these residues failed to activate transducin (12Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With α1B-adrenergic receptors, mutation of the Arg to some amino acids caused inhibition of stimulated signaling whereas mutation to Lys increased basal signaling, and mutation of Asp to Ala caused a marked increase in basal activity (13Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar,14Scheer A. Costa T. Fanelli F. De Benedetti P.G. Mhaouty-Kodja S. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 219-231PubMed Google Scholar). In the receptor for gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which has an Asp-Arg-Ser sequence at the intracellular end of TMH3, mutation of Arg markedly decreased agonist-stimulated activation whereas the Asp to Asn mutation was less active than the wild type (Asp→Ala did not express, Ref. 15Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

In the CB2 cannabinoid receptor, mutation of Arg to Ala inhibited agonist-stimulated signaling, Asp to Ala abolished signaling, and Tyr to Ala inhibited signaling; there was no apparent effect on basal signaling (16Rhee M.H. Nevo I. Levy R. Vogel Z. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Arg of the DRY sequence in the oxytocin receptor caused the receptor mutant to be constitutively active (17Fanelli F. Barbier P. Zanchetta D. De Benedetti P.G. Chini B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). With the histamine H2 receptor, which is constitutively active, mutation of Asp caused increased constitutive signaling whereas mutation of Arg caused a decrease in signaling activity (18Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Jacobs E.H. Smit M.J. Roovers E. Cotecchia S. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence at the putative intracellular end of TMH3 in KSHV-GPCR is Val-Arg-Tyr. It is particularly relevant, therefore, that mutation of the Asp of the DRY sequence in the chemokine receptor CXCR2 (the human receptor most homologous to KSHV-GPCR) to Val caused constitutive activation of this receptor (19Burger M. Burger J.A. Hoch R.C. Oades Z. Takamori H. Schraufstatter I.U. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2017-2022PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have performed mutational analysis of the residues at the intracellular end of TMH2 and of nonconserved Asp residues in TMH2 and TMH3 in KSHV-GPCR. We have focused primarily on the effects of these residues on constitutive signaling, because it is easier to understand the intramolecular interactions that lead to conformational changes involved in receptor activation in the absence of agonist binding. Arg-143 in KSHV-GPCR was determined to be critical for signaling. Moreover, mutation of Asp-83 caused increased basal signaling, and mutations at these two positions acted synergistically to increase constitutive signaling. A model is presented that predicts these site-specific substitutions act independently to activate KSHV-GPCR. All KSHV-GPCR mutants were constructed by PCR using pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR as template unless otherwise stated. V142N, R143A, R143K, R143Q, Y144A, and Y144F were constructed using the following oligonucleotides: (a) 5′-TACTTGGATATCTTCAGTGTTGTGTGCGTCAGTCTAAACAGGTACCTCCTGGTGGCATATTCTACG-3′; (b) 5′-TACTTGGATATCTTCAGTGTTGTGTGCGTCAGTCTAGTGGCGTACCTCCTGGTGGCATATTCTACG-3′; (c) 5′-TACTTGGATATCTTCAGTGTTGTGTGCGTCAGTCTAGTGAAGTACCTCCTGGTGGCATATTCTACG-3′; (d) 5′-TACTTGGATATCTTCAGTGTTGTGTGCGTCAGTCTAGTGCAGTACCTCCTGGTGGCATATTCTACG-3′; (e) 5′-TACTTGGATATCTTCAGTGTTGTGTGCGTCAGTCTAGTGAGGGCCCTCCTGGTGGCATATTCTACG-3′; and (f) 5′-TACTTGGATATCTTCAGTGTTGTGTGCGTCAGTCTAGTGAGGTTCCTCCTGGTGGCATATTCTACG-3′, respectively, as sense primers, and (g) 5′-CTAGTCTAGAGATCCTCCGGAGAGGCTAGATTAAATTAAGGGGGAAGGGCA-3′ as the antisense primer. EcoRV and XbaI restriction sites were used to clone the PCR fragments into pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR. All the mutants were confirmed by sequencing. For mutants V142D, D132A, and D132N, the following antisense oligonucleotides were used: (h) 5′-CAGGAGGTACCTGTCTAGACTGACGCACACAACACTGAAGAT-3′; (i) 5′-CAGGAGGTACCTCACTAGACTGACGCACACAACACTGAAGATAGCCAAGTAGACATATAAATAGTA-3′; and (j) 5′-CAGGAGGTACCTCACTAGACTGACGCACACAACACTGAAGATATTCAAGTAGACATATAAATAGTA-3′, respectively, and (k) 5′-ATCCG-GCTAGC-AAGCTT-GAATTC-TCCGGA-CCACC-ATGGCGGCCGAGGATTTCCTAACCATCTTCTTA-3′ as the sense primer. HindIII and KpnI restriction sites were used to clone the PCR products into pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR, and the mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Overlapping PCRs were performed to generate D83A and D83N KSHV-GPCRs. In both constructions the same sense and antisense primers were used: (l) 5′-CAAGTG-GAATTC-TCCGGA-AGATCT-AATATT-GTTAAC-CACC-ATGGCGGCCGAGGATTTCCTAACCATCTTC-3′ and (m) 5′-ACTGCTTCTTGGGCCAGGAACGCGTAG-3′. The two overlapping primers were as follows: (n) 5′-CGGGCAGGAGCGATAGCTATACTGCTCCTGGGTATCTGCCTAAAC-3′ and (o) 5′-ACCCAGGAGCAGTATAGCTATCGCTCCTGCCCGCGATCGGTGCTT-3′ for D83A; and (p) 5′-CGGGCAGGAGCGATAAATATACTGCTCCTGGGTATCTGCCTAAAC-3′ and (q) 5′-ACCCAGGAGCAGTATATTTATCGCTCCTGCCCGCGATCGGTGCTT-3′ for D83N. EcoRI and EcoRV restriction sites were used to clone the PCR products into pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR, and the mutants were confirmed by sequencing. The double mutant D83A/D132A was generated using primer kand i as sense and antisense primer, respectively, using D83A KSHV-GPCR as the template. HindIII and KpnI restriction sites were used to clone the PCR products into pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR, and the mutants were confirmed by sequencing. D83A/V142D, D83A/R143K, and D83A/R143Q double mutants were constructed through digesting and ligating the respective single mutants using EcoRI and EcoRV restriction sites. COS-1 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (5Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) with pcDNA 3.1 plasmids encoding the wild-type or mutant KSHV-GPCR. Mock transfectants were cells transfected with plasmid not encoding a receptor. Various amounts of plasmid DNA were used to attain different levels of receptor expression. Transfected cells were re-seeded into 24-well plates 24 h after transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% Nu-Serum (Collaborative Research) and 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 48 or 72 h after transfection, the medium was removed, and cells were rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (HHBSS). The cells were then incubated in HHBSS containing 10 mm LiCl in the absence or presence of growth-related oncogene α (Groα), which is a chemokine agonist for KSHV-GPCR (20Gershengorn M.C. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Clark-Lewis I. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), for 2 h at 37 °C. Accumulated inositol phosphates (IPs) were measured using ion-exchange chromatography as described (22Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). IP accumulation was analyzed as [3H]IPs/([3H]lipids + [3H]IPs). Cells were transfected and seeded as described above except that no myo-[3H]inositol was added. 48 h after reseeding, cells were rinsed once with cold HHBSS and then incubated in cold HHBSS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 10 pm125I-labeled Groα (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of Groα for 4 h at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of cold HHBSS containing 0.5 mNaCl and lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.4 n NaOH. Cell lysates were transferred to glass test tubes and counted in a gamma counter. Construction of the model of KSHV-GPCR was as follows. The helical boundaries of KSHV-GPCR were determined from a multiple alignment of the sequence of the receptor with those of the nine known chemokine receptors. The conserved residues in TMH1 (Asn-65), TMH3 (Arg-143), TMH5 (Pro-233), and TMH7 (Pro-311) were used to align the sequence with that of rhodopsin. Because TMH2, TMH4, and TMH6 of KSHV-GPCR lacked the usual conserved residues of GPCRs of the rhodopsin family, their boundaries were determined from the alignment with the other chemokine receptors in which the conserved residues are present. The assigned helical segments were superimposed on the Cα template of the TMH bundle designed by Baldwin et al.(23Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The short loops, i.e. intracellular loops 1, 2, and 3 and extracellular loop 1 were designed as turns such that the distance between the ends of the loops was approximately equal to the distances between the helices that the loops were connecting. Extracellular loop 2 was divided into two segments. The first extracellular loop 2 segment spanned the sequence from the top of TMH4 to Cys-196, which putatively forms a disulfide bridge with Cys-118 at the top of TMH3. The second segment of extracellular loop 2 spanned the sequence from the disulfide bridge to the point the loop connected with TMH5. Each of the segments was designed as a turn. Because extracellular loop 3 is too long to design as a turn, it was constructed by homology to a sequence identified in a known structure of the protein 1EMS (Nit-Fragile Histidine Triad Fusion Protein) with 77% similarity and 41% identity. The loop has a distinct helical segment followed by a turn, and the distance between the ends of the loop agrees well with the distance between TMH6 and TMH7. The loops were connected manually and the entire system was minimized with a distance-dependent dielectric constant. The construction of the receptor was done with Insight and the structure optimizations with CHARMM 26. The chemokine receptor CXCR2 was constructed in a similar way using the aligned sequence from the multiple alignment as above. Statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance. To show that Arg-143 at the intracellular end of TMH3 is involved in signaling in KSHV-GPCR, Arg-143 was mutated to Ala, Gln, or Lys. The three mutant receptors exhibited binding affinities for125I-labeled Groα that were within 2-fold of the affinity of KSHV-GPCR (Figs. 1 A and2 B). We measured constitutive signaling activity of these receptors as ligand-independent signaling that is directly related to the level of receptors expressed transiently in COS-1 cells. Fig. 1 B illustrates the results from experiments in which the basal production of inositol phosphate second messenger molecules was measured in populations of cells expressing different levels of KSHV-GPCR and mutants of Arg-143. Basal signaling was measured as the slope of the regression line of inositol phosphate production versus receptor level. Mutation of Arg-143 to either Gln or Ala abolished basal signaling (p < 0.001) whereas mutation to Lys created a receptor with 50% of the basal activity of KSHV-GPCR (p < 0.01)(Fig. 2 A). Cells expressing R143A exhibited no significant increase in signaling upon addition of Groα whereas R143Q was stimulated by 2-fold with Groα, and R143K exhibited a response to Groα that was similar to KSHV-GPCR (Fig. 1 C). These data show that Arg-143 is important for basal and stimulated signaling by KSHV-GPCR.Figure 2Comparison of the basal signaling activities and binding affinities of KSHV-GPCRs. The experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

Y144F and Y144A exhibited binding affinities for 125I-labeled Groα (Fig.2 B), basal signaling activities (Fig. 2 A), and Groα-stimulated signaling activities (data not shown) that were not different from KSHV-GPCR. Thus, Tyr-144 is not important for KSHV-GPCR binding and signaling. In contrast to most GPCRs of the rhodopsin family, there is a Val before Arg-Tyr at the intracellular end of TMH3 in KSHV-GPCR. As noted above, mutation of the Asp in the DRY sequence of chemokine receptor CXCR2 to Val caused the receptor to become more constitutively active (19Burger M. Burger J.A. Hoch R.C. Oades Z. Takamori H. Schraufstatter I.U. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2017-2022PubMed Google Scholar). With mutation of Val-142 to Asn and Asp in KSHV-GPCR, V142N exhibited an affinity that was indistinguishable from KSHV-GPCR, and V142D exhibited binding affinity for 125I-labeled Groα that was within 2-fold of KSHV-GPCR (Fig. 2 B). V142N exhibited a basal level of signaling that was indistinguishable from KSHV-GPCR (p > 0.1, Fig. 2 A). Figs.2 A and 3 illustrate that V142D is more basally active than KSHV-GPCR (p < 0.01). The basal signaling activity of V142D, however, was only minimally stimulated by Groα (data not shown). These findings are different from those reported by Rosenkilde et al. (11Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Holst P.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26309-26315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) who concluded that V142D exhibited the same basal signaling activity as KSHV-GPCR. In their analysis, however, Rosenkilde et al. (11Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Holst P.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26309-26315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) did not compare basal signaling to receptor expression but compared it instead to the amount of plasmid used in the transfection and assumed that the levels of receptor expression were similar. We have found that several of the more active mutant receptors were expressed at lower levels than KSHV-GPCR. Moreover, these levels varied from experiment to experiment. We, therefore, determined receptor expression in each experiment to measure basal signaling accurately. Based on data from experiments with other GPCRs, for example, the α1B-adrenerergic receptor (13Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 14Scheer A. Costa T. Fanelli F. De Benedetti P.G. Mhaouty-Kodja S. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 219-231PubMed Google Scholar) and the receptor for oxytocin (17Fanelli F. Barbier P. Zanchetta D. De Benedetti P.G. Chini B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the positive side chain of the Arg of the (D/E)RY sequence may interact with a highly conserved Asp residue in the mid-portion of TMH2. There is no Asp in the usual position in TMH2 in KSHV-GPCR, but there is an Asp near the intracellular end of TMH2 at position 83. With mutation of Asp-83 to Ala and Asn, D83A and D83N exhibited affinities for125I-labeled Groα that were indistinguishable from KSHV-GPCR (Fig. 2 B). D83N exhibited basal signaling activity that was 110% above KSHV-GPCR (p < 0.001), and D83A exhibited activity that was 190% above KSHV-GPCR (p < 0.001)(Figs. 2 A and 4). We next constructed the double mutants D83A/R143K and D83A/R143Q to determine whether these two mutations would interact to affect the phenotype of the doubly mutated receptor. The hypothesis was that if these mutations caused independent effects on basal signaling activity, then the basal activities of the double mutants would be at least the sum of the individual mutations. D83A/R143K and D83A/R143Q exhibited high affinity 125I-labeled Groα binding that was similar to KSHV-GPCR (Fig. 2 B). D83A/R143K exhibited basal activity that was 70% greater than KSHV-GPCR (p < 0.005), and D83A/R143Q showed activity that was 30% above KSHV-GPCR (p < 0.025, Fig. 2 A). These levels of signaling were equal to the addition of the effects of the individual mutations and are consistent with the idea that these substitutions caused effects that were independent of one another. Another negatively charged residue that could be part of a putative hydrophilic pocket in the TMH bundle is Asp-132 in TMH3 in KSHV-GPCR. With mutation of Asp-132 to Ala and Asn, D132A exhibited an affinity that was within 2-fold of KSHV-GPCR and D132N exhibited an affinity that was indistinguishable from KSHV-GPCR (Fig. 2 B). D132A exhibited activity that was 60% above KSHV-GPCR (p < 0.01), and D132N exhibited basal signaling activity that was similar to KSHV-GPCR (p > 0.1)(Figs. 2 A and 4). D132A was not stimulated further by Groα whereas D132N was stimulated by Groα to the same extent as KSHV-GPCR (data not shown). We constructed the double mutant D83A/D132A that exhibited similar basal signaling activity as D83A (Fig. 2 A) and was not stimulated by Groα (data not shown). Thus, a negatively charged residue at position 132 was not as important as at position 83 in maintaining the wild-type level of basal activity. Moreover, the lack of additive effects of substituting Ala for Asp-83 and Asp-132 is consistent with the idea that these substitutions affected basal signaling via similar mechanisms (see below). We next constructed the double mutant D83A/V142D. Although D83A/V142D exhibited the same high affinity for 125I-labeled Groα as KSHV-GPCR, the level of D83A/V142D expression was always lower than KSHV-GPCR when the same amounts of plasmid DNA were used for transfection. D83A/V142D exhibited basal signaling activity that was 510% greater than KSHV-GPCR (p < 0.001, Figs.2 A and 4). That is, the effect of having both mutations in the same receptor was synergistic with regard to basal signaling compared with D83A and V142D with individual mutations. This finding is consistent with the idea that these two substitutions act independently to activate the receptor (see below). The signaling activity of D83A/V142D was not further stimulated by Groα (data not shown). D83A/V142D was the most active KSHV-GPCR receptor mutant we have found. Because other constitutively active GPCR mutants have been shown to be less stable than native, basally inactive receptors (18Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Jacobs E.H. Smit M.J. Roovers E. Cotecchia S. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), it is possible that the low level of expression of D83A/V142D is caused by its decreased stability. Lastly, to determine whether these most constitutively active receptors could be inhibited by the three chemokines found to be inverse agonists of KSHV-GPCR (21Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Ho H. Clark-Lewis I. Gershengorn M.C.

Commun. 1998; 253: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we measured the effects of interferon γ-inducible protein-10, stromal-derived factor-1 and viral monocyte inflammatory protein-II. All three chemokines inhibited V142D and D83A to an extent similar to inhibition of KSHV-GPCR but none of them had a consistent effect on basal signaling by D83A/V142D (Fig.5). We cannot provide an explanation for these differences because the mechanism by which inverse agonists inhibit KSHV-GPCR signaling is not known. It seems, however, that the ability of the inverse agonists to inhibit signaling by these receptors was inversely related to the level of constitutive activity of the receptor. Other KSHV-GPCR mutants have been found to be unresponsive to inverse agonist inhibition but these were receptors with mutations in their amino-terminal domains that caused loss of binding (10Ho H.H. Du D. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31327-31332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Holst P.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26309-26315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We constructed a computer model of KSHV-GPCR to help explain our findings (Fig. 6). The model predicts that Val-142 and Arg-143 in KSHV-GPCR are at the intracellular end of TMH3. In rhodopsin (28Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5002) Google Scholar), in which the sequence at the intracellular end of TMH3 is ERY, as well as in our model of CXCR2 (not shown) in which the sequence is DRY, the side chain of Arg-143 interacts with the negatively charged residue proximal to it. In KSHV-GPCR such an interaction is impossible because Val-142 replaces the negatively charged residue. Thus, the side chain of Arg-143 has no partner to stabilize its positive charge. Asp-83, which is predicted to be positioned at the intracellular end of TMH2 in KSHV-GPCR, is highly conserved in the chemokine receptor family. In other receptors of the rhodopsin family, this residue is an Asn. An examination of the model of KSHV-GPCR (Fig. 6) shows that this residue is directed inbetween TMH1 and TMH7 and is stabilized by a set of interactions with backbone N–H groups. It is also positioned close to Arg-78 in intracellular loop 1. The position and orientation of Asp-83 place it on the opposite side of TMH2 pointing away from TMH3. Thus, this residue shows no interaction with Arg-143 in TMH3. This is in full agreement with the position of the conserved Asn in TMH2 of rhodopsin as seen in its recent crystal structure (28Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5002) Google Scholar). The model predicts that Arg-143 and Asp-83 do not interact. As described above, our experimental findings provide functional evidence that these residues do not interact also. Because basal signaling by KSHV-GPCR is very active (5Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that its structure is a model for the active states of GPCRs of the rhodopsin family including agonist-occupied receptors. Study of the structure-function relationship of constitutively active GPCRs (8Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Gershengorn M.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 27-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has the advantage of elucidating the three-dimensional structure of the active state of the receptor in the absence of a complicating ligand. This approach has been taken in a small number of instances. For example, we showed that models of the three-dimensional structure of constitutively active receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) predict conformations similar to that of the TRH-occupied receptor (29Colson A.-O. Perlman J.H. Jinsi-Parimoo A. Nussenzveig D.R. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 968-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lin et al. (30Lin Z.L. Shenker A. Pearlstein R. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) predicted from a model of the luteinizing hormone receptor the changes in receptor structure that cause activation and used functional analysis of naturally occurring, constitutively active receptors to support their predictions. We suggest that further structure/function studies of basally active GPCRs will provide important insights into the mechanism of receptor activation. In the study reported here, we constructed and characterized a number of mutant receptors in which charged residues in TMH2 and TMH3 were substituted to gain insight into the role of these residues in signaling by KSHV-GPCR. As discussed in the Introduction, charged residues within the (D/E)RY sequence at the intracellular end of TMH3 have been shown to play important roles in signaling in a number of GPCRs (12Franke R.R.

Charged residues in other domains within GPCRs have been shown to be important for signaling also. For example, Perez and coworkers (31Porter J.E. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 32Porter J.E. Perez D.M. J. Biol.

Donohue et al. (33Donohue P.J. Sainz E. Akeson M. Kroog G.S. Mantey S.A. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9366-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) developed support for the idea that a salt-bridge between an Asp at the extracellular loop 1/TMH2 boundary and an Arg at the extracellular loop 3/TMH7 boundary constrained the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor in conformation that is needed for coupling to G proteins. We showed that an Arg residue in TMH6 of the TRH receptor was involved in receptor activation (34Perlman J.H. Laakkonen L. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 480-484PubMed Google Scholar). Here we found several different phenotypes with regard to signaling properties of KSHV-GPCR mutants substituted at charged residues even though all the mutant receptors exhibited high binding affinity for Groα. D132N exhibited basal and Groα-stimulated signaling activity indistinguishable from KSHV-GPCR. R143Q had little basal activity but exhibited-fold stimulation by Groα that was similar to KSHV-GPCR whereas R143K had a 50% reduced basal activity but was stimulated by Groα to the same level as KSHV-GPCR. In contrast, R143A did not signal basally and could not be stimulated by Groα. A number of mutant receptors such as D83A, D83N, and D132A exhibited higher basal activity than KSHV-GPCR but were only minimally stimulated by Groα. Thus, some single site-specific substitutions of charged residues led to receptors that were more basally active than KSHV-GPCR. The double mutants D83A/R143K and D83A/R143Q exhibited basal signaling activity that appeared to be equal to the additive effects of the single mutations. That is, these receptors exhibited basal activities that were intermediate between those of D83A and R143K or R143Q. Perhaps the most interesting receptor phenotype was that exhibited by the double mutant D83A/V142D. This mutant had basal signaling activity that was markedly greater than either single mutant D83A or V142D (see below). Mutations in other domains of KSHV-GPCR have previously been shown to generate receptors with different phenotypes including receptors that do not bind ligands with high affinity (10Ho H.H. Du D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26309-26315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) such as D83A, D83N, and D132A, and receptors that exhibit lowered basal activity but could be stimulated by agonist (11Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Holst P.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26309-26315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), such as R143Q and R143K. Thus, selective mutation of KSHV-GPCR can lead to different phenotypes, similar to what has been reported with other GPCRs. The phenotype of the double mutant D83A/V142D was unexpected. Before the construction of our model, we believed that Arg-143 and Asp-83 may interact, as has been proposed for the Arg of (D/E)RY and a highly conserved Asp in TMH2 of other GPCRs (13Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 15Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10445-10453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), even though Asp-83 was not in the same position in TMH2 as the highly conserved Asp. Our findings, however, are consistent with the idea that Asp-83 at the intracellular end of TMH2 and Arg-143 at the intracellular end of TMH3 are important for KSHV-GPCR signaling but act independently of one another. We draw this conclusion based in particular on the observation that the double mutant D83A/V142D exhibits a higher level of constitutive signaling than would be expected by the addition of the increased signaling exhibited by the two single mutants D83A and V142D. Indeed, if Arg-143 and Asp-83 interact in KSHV-GPCR, we would expect that the double mutant would exhibit basal signaling activity equal to that of one of the individual mutant receptors. Moreover, our model is consistent with independent effects of substituting these two residues because the model of KSHV-GPCR predicts that the sidechain of Arg-143 resides in a hydrophilic pocket formed by helices 1, 2, and 7 within the TMH bundle and the sidechain of Asp-83 faces outside the bundle in a position on the side of TMH2 away from TMH3 near intracellular loop 1. That is, these two residues are predicted to be in the wrong orientation relative to one another and too far apart to interact. We can speculate on a mechanism to explain this phenotype that is consistent with the predictions of our model and with our data. It is possible that Arg-143 resides in the TMH bundle in a partially activated receptor and that movement out of the bundle caused by agonist stimulation in KSHV-GPCR or by interaction with Asp substituted at position 142 in V142D leads to further activation. This may occur because Arg-143 out of the TMH bundle interacts with residues in intracellular loop 3 to promote higher affinity coupling to G protein. Asp-83 interacts with residues in intracellular loop 1 in a partially activated receptor and upon agonist stimulation in KSHV-GPCR or substitution by Ala in D83A this interaction is lost, and the loss of this constraint allows intracellular loop 1 to couple to G protein more effectively. The synergism occurs because when both of these changes occur in the same receptor, the coupling between receptor and G protein is markedly enhanced. These observations support the concept that a receptor can exist in multiple conformational states along a continuum from completely inactive to fully active (35Scheer A. Cotecchia S. J. Recept. Signal Transduct Res. 1997; 17: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have found that charged residues, Arg-143 and Asp-83, at the intracellular ends of TMH2 and TMH3, respectively, upon mutation affect signaling by KSHV-GPCR. We suggest that these residues are directly involved in KSHV-GPCR signaling perhaps by mediating changes in receptor conformation or by interacting with the G protein. It is possible, however, that the signaling changes observed upon their mutation may be caused by indirect effects. Arg at this position, which is highly conserved in all GPCRs of the rhodopsin family, has been shown to be important in signaling in all receptors in which the residue has been studied. Asp at this position, which is found in all chemokine receptors but not in most members of the rhodopsin family, has not been studied in mammalian chemokine receptors. Substitutions that we predict affect both of these residues in D83A/V142D lead to a receptor with more than 6 times the basal signaling activity of KSHV-GPCR but which no longer responds to stimulation by agonist or to inhibition by inverse agonist. KSHV-GPCR is thought to be a pirated chemokine receptor that has mutated to serve an important, but unknown function(s) in the viral life cycle. Our findings show that additional mutation of KSHV-GPCR can create a receptor that is more basally active and not regulatable by chemokines. We suggest, therefore, that the phenotype of high basal but chemokine-regulated signaling activity are attributes of KSHV-GPCR that are important to KSHV survival."

Previous studies have focused on elements within the gene promoter which activate transcription of the gene. Here, we identify two regions of the gene which repress transcription: An element upstream of the basal gene promoter at −1718/−1458, represses expression of a reporter gene by approximately 50%; addition of the first intron to any promoter-reporter construct also strongly represses gene expression. The TIMP-1 gene has a short first exon which is transcribed but not translated, with the translation start site located in exon 2. Deletion analysis through intron 1 reveals a number of potential regions which might mediate its effect.

Where investigated, the control ofTIMP-1 gene expression in connective tissue cells is at the level of transcription.The TIMP-1 gene differs from other TIMP family members in having a short first exon which is transcribed, but not translated, with the translation start site located on exon 2. There is evidence that regulatory sequences exist within the first intron of theTimp-1 gene. Flenniken and Williams (9Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) found that a construct containing around 1.3 kb of murine Timp-1 5′-flanking sequence, exon 1, and most of intron 1 linked to alacZ reporter in transgenic mice was sufficient to reproduce the spatial and temporal expression of the Timp-1 gene in developing mouse embryos. In contrast to this, transgenic mice carryinglacZ linked to 2.7 kb of Timp-1 5′-flanking sequence, but lacking intron 1, display a subset of the correct pattern of expression (e.g. appropriate expression in the developing vertebral column, and absence in the liver), but also inappropriate expression of the the reporter in sites such as the spinal cord. 2D. R. Edwards, unpublished data. 2D. R. Edwards, unpublished data. Thus sequences within intron 1 are likely to repress Timp-1 gene expression.This study investigates in more detail the properties of the first intron in the human TIMP-1 gene, and identifies a further repressive element upstream within the gene promoter. We report that the whole of the first intron strongly represses expression of a reporter gene, while deletion analysis reveals a number of potential regions which might mediate its effect. Protein binding studies and mutational analyses reveal that a repressive element at +684/+748 binds Sp1, Sp3, and an unidentified Ets-related factor to suppress transcription. Furthermore, a region upstream of the promoter between −1718 and −1458 also represses expression of a reporter gene.DISCUSSIONOur previous data (10Clark I.M. Rowan A.D. Edwards D.R. Bech-Hansen T. Mann D.A. Bahr M.J. Cawston T.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) addressed the identity of the minimal promoter for the human TIMP-1 gene, utilizing a −738/+95 fragment as our starting point. However, our genomic clone contained upstream sequences to −1718 and downstream sequences through the first intron and into exon 2 (+1188). In order to study the function of these sequences, more distal to the transcription start point, we performed deletional analyses from both 5′ and 3′ ends of a −1718/+988 construct (containing the translation start point ATG within exon 2 at the 3′ end). In order to increase expression from a CAT reporter, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the experiment, the 5′ deletion set was assessed in a +95 context (downstream sequences being highly repressive, see below). Of the 5′ sequence, the removal of the −1718/−1458 region, increased the basal expression of aCAT reporter gene by approximately 2-fold; no further differences were observed with deletions to −738. Interestingly, this region contains an Alu repeat at −1687/−1487. Alu repeats are sequences interspersed throughout the human genome with an average spacing of 5 kb, with the total number of Alu repeats estimated at more than 500,000 in the haploid human genome (18Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Mol. Gen. Metabol. 1999; 67: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Their function is unclear, but they often delineate genes, and hence, the −1687/−1487 Alu repeat may represent the 5′ boundary of the human TIMP-1 gene. Alternatively, they have been frequently identified in the regulatory regions of genes, both associated with transcriptional enhancers and silencers (19Vansant G. Reynolds W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8229-8233Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role in modulating gene expression. However, until further deletional and mutational analyses of the −1718/−1458 region are performed, the possible role of Alu in expression of the human TIMP-1 gene remains purely speculative.The addition of intron 1 to the −1718/+95 construct repressed basal expression of the CAT reporter to background levels. Since exon 1 of the TIMP-1 gene is transcribed, but not translated, with the translation start site ATG at the beginning of exon 2, we made constructs both with and without the intron 1/exon 2 junction, and with and without the exon 2 ATG: the level of expression from all of these constructs was low. We had predicted this pattern from previous studies with transgenic mice: a lacZ transgene driven by 1.3 kb of the murine Timp-1 5′-flanking sequence, exon 1 and most of intron 1 (−1350/+775 of the murine Timp-1 gene) was reported to be sufficient to reproduce the spatial and temporal expression of the Timp-1 gene during murine embryonic development (9Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); in contrast, our own studies2 showed that a transgene driven by 2.7 kb of murine Timp-1 5′-flanking DNA, part of exon 1, but lacking the intron 1 (−2700/+47), display only a subset of correct developmental expression, with inappropriate expression in sites where the Timp-1 gene itself is silent. This is despite the fact that these same sequences (−2700/+47), driving a CAT reporter in stably transfected cells, recapitulate the responses of the native gene to phorbol ester, serum, transforming growth factor-β, epidermal growth factor, and dexamethasone in vitro. The intronic sequences are therefore implicated in repression of the Timp-1 gene in the mouse, and this is supported by the fact that constructs of −2700/+775 and −223/+775 of the murine Timp-1 gene in a CAT reporter vector show greatly reduced expression compared with constructs with end points at +190. 3S. Logan and Z. Werb, personal communication. It should be noted here that the murine intron 1 is 704 base pairs, compared with the human intron 1 of 929 base pairs. There are several examples of regulatory elements, both positive and negative, within introns, most commonly the first intron; this has perhaps been best described in the collagen gene family (Ref. 20Bornstein P. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, and references therein). These may be important in physiology and pathology, e.g. a G/T polymorphism in an Sp1 site within the first intron of theCol1A1 gene, has been associated with reduced bone mineral density and a tendency for osteoporotic fracture (21Grant S.F.A. Reid D.M. Blake G. Herd R. Fogelman I. Ralston S.H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar).Further 3′ deletional analysis through intron 1 revealed a complex pattern of increasing and decreasing reporter gene expression. We considered the possibility that an mRNA containing intronic sequences might contain many ATG translation start sites followed by in-frame stop codons; however, only three ATG sequences exist within intron 1 at +136/+138, +906/+908, and +915/+917, and their removal does not correlate with changes in reporter gene expression. Furthermore, we discovered experimentally that constructs −1718/+748 and −1718/+684 both undergo splicing of at least part of the intron using cryptic splice junction acceptor sites, removing the ATG at +136/+138. It is possible that intron 1 contains a number of regulatory elements, both positive and negative, and that on deletion of one of these elements, another becomes dominant, explaining the pattern of increased and decreased expression in the 3′ deletion set. This pattern is unlikely to be an artifact since more than one construct exhibits each of the levels of expression observed.Since the first increase in expression of the reporter was observed when the +748/+684 region was deleted, protein binding to this region was assessed using DNase I footprinting. This revealed protection across a sequence containing consensus binding sites for the transcription factors c-Myb, Sp1, and c-Ets. EMSA demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 could bind to the Sp1 consensus at +708/+716; the ability of an anti-Sp1 antibody to block this binding at 4 °C was only partial in the context of a +698/+743 oligonucleotide, whereas, complete abrogation of binding was seen in the context of a shorter, +698/+726 oligonucleotide. This suggests that additional factors binding within +726/+743 are tethering the Sp1 factor to its cognate sequence. This is reinforced by the fact that recombinant Sp1 alone does not bind to either the +698/+743 or +698/+726 oligonucleotides; however, in the additional presence of a nuclear extract, the recombinant Sp1 binds strongly to both oligonucleotides, also displacing the Sp3 which would otherwise bind to this Sp1 consensus. It is also apparent that mutation within the Sp consensus only partially blocks binding of the Sp1-Sp3 complex or the recombinant Sp1 in the context of +698/+743, but completely blocks binding in the context of +698/+726. GC boxes (and the related GT boxes) are one of the most widely distributed motifs in promoter elements, and were originally thought to be bound only by the transcription factor Sp1 (22Kadonga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). More recently, further related proteins have been identified (Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4) which have similar structural features and transcriptional properties (23Suske G. Gene (Amst. ). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). While Sp1 activates transcription, the function of Sp3 is less clear, acting as an activator or repressor depending on the context and number of binding sites (17Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In respect of the humanTIMP-1 gene, there are at least nine Sp1 family consensus sequences within the −1718/+988 region (10Clark I.M. Rowan A.D. Edwards D.R. Bech-Hansen T. Mann D.A. Bahr M.J. Cawston T.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Forced overexpression of Sp1 in primary human skin fibroblasts has little effect on basal expression of CAT reporter from constructs −1718/+988, −1718/+748, −1718/+684; overexpression of Sp3 appears suppressive to these constructs (data not shown). Since this is true for the −1718/+684 construct, suppression is mediated through more than just the +708/+716 site described above.Three sets of point mutations were introduced into the −1718/+988 construct to ascertain the role of the transcription factor binding seen in EMSA: A mutation which abrogated Sp1/3 binding to the +708/+716 site, a mutation which increased Sp1/3 binding to this site (data not shown) but destroys the neighboring c-Ets consensus at +703/+710, and a mutation which destroys the c-Ets consensus without altering Sp1/3 binding. All of these mutations increased expression in the context of −1718/+988 (and in a shorter −1718/+843 construct, data not shown). The cryptic splice junction acceptor sites at −712 and −676 are not used by these constructs, which splice correctly. Hence, it appears that any alteration in this region leads to an increase in expression, perhaps because a higher order protein complex is disrupted,e.g. with proteins binding around the transcription start point.In summary, intron 1 of the human TIMP-1 gene strongly suppresses gene expression. However, within the intron are a number of elements which have the capacity to induce expression, and these may be involved in relieving repression at sites where the gene is expressedin vivo, and/or in response to cytokines and growth factors. Our future work aims to investigate this gene further using a transgenic mouse system. The matrix metalloproteinases are a family of enzymes involved in the turnover and degradation of extracellular matrix (1Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

There are several examples of regulatory elements, both positive and negative, within introns, most commonly the first intron; this has perhaps been best described in the collagen gene family (Ref. 20Bornstein P. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, and references therein). These may be important in physiology and pathology, e.g. a G/T polymorphism in an Sp1 site within the first intron of theCol1A1 gene, has been associated with reduced bone mineral density and a tendency for osteoporotic fracture (21Grant S.F.A. Reid D.M. Blake G. Herd R. Fogelman I. Ralston S.H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar).Further 3′ deletional analysis through intron 1 revealed a complex pattern of increasing and decreasing reporter gene expression. We considered the possibility that an mRNA containing intronic sequences might contain many ATG translation start sites followed by in-frame stop codons; however, only three ATG sequences exist within intron 1 at +136/+138, +906/+908, and +915/+917, and their removal does not correlate with changes in reporter gene expression. Furthermore, we discovered experimentally that constructs −1718/+748 and −1718/+684 both undergo splicing of at least part of the intron using cryptic splice junction acceptor sites, removing the ATG at +136/+138. It is possible that intron 1 contains a number of regulatory elements, both positive and negative, and that on deletion of one of these elements, another becomes dominant, explaining the pattern of increased and decreased expression in the 3′ deletion set. This pattern is unlikely to be an artifact since more than one construct exhibits each of the levels of expression observed.Since the first increase in expression of the reporter was observed when the +748/+684 region was deleted, protein binding to this region was assessed using DNase I footprinting. This revealed protection across a sequence containing consensus binding sites for the transcription factors c-Myb, Sp1, and c-Ets. EMSA demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 could bind to the Sp1 consensus at +708/+716; the ability of an anti-Sp1 antibody to block this binding at 4 °C was only partial in the context of a +698/+743 oligonucleotide, whereas, complete abrogation of binding was seen in the context of a shorter, +698/+726 oligonucleotide. This suggests that additional factors binding within +726/+743 are tethering the Sp1 factor to its cognate sequence. This is reinforced by the fact that recombinant Sp1 alone does not bind to either the +698/+743 or +698/+726 oligonucleotides; however, in the additional presence of a nuclear extract, the recombinant Sp1 binds strongly to both oligonucleotides, also displacing the Sp3 which would otherwise bind to this Sp1 consensus. It is also apparent that mutation within the Sp consensus only partially blocks binding of the Sp1-Sp3 complex or the recombinant Sp1 in the context of +698/+743, but completely blocks binding in the context of +698/+726. GC boxes (and the related GT boxes) are one of the most widely distributed motifs in promoter elements, and were originally thought to be bound only by the transcription factor Sp1 (22Kadonga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). More recently, further related proteins have been identified (Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4) which have similar structural features and transcriptional properties (23Suske G. Gene (Amst. ). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). While Sp1 activates transcription, the function of Sp3 is less clear, acting as an activator or repressor depending on the context and number of binding sites (17Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In respect of the humanTIMP-1 gene, there are at least nine Sp1 family consensus sequences within the −1718/+988 region (10Clark I.M. Rowan A.D. Edwards D.R. Bech-Hansen T. Mann D.A. Bahr M.J. Cawston T.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Forced overexpression of Sp1 in primary human skin fibroblasts has little effect on basal expression of CAT reporter from constructs −1718/+988, −1718/+748, −1718/+684; overexpression of Sp3 appears suppressive to these constructs (data not shown). Since this is true for the −1718/+684 construct, suppression is mediated through more than just the +708/+716 site described above.Three sets of point mutations were introduced into the −1718/+988 construct to ascertain the role of the transcription factor binding seen in EMSA: A mutation which abrogated Sp1/3 binding to the +708/+716 site, a mutation which increased Sp1/3 binding to this site (data not shown) but destroys the neighboring c-Ets consensus at +703/+710, and a mutation which destroys the c-Ets consensus without altering Sp1/3 binding. All of these mutations increased expression in the context of −1718/+988 (and in a shorter −1718/+843 construct, data not shown). The cryptic splice junction acceptor sites at −712 and −676 are not used by these constructs, which splice correctly. Hence, it appears that any alteration in this region leads to an increase in expression, perhaps because a higher order protein complex is disrupted,e.g. with proteins binding around the transcription start point.In summary, intron 1 of the human TIMP-1 gene strongly suppresses gene expression. However, within the intron are a number of elements which have the capacity to induce expression, and these may be involved in relieving repression at sites where the gene is expressedin vivo, and/or in response to cytokines and growth factors. Our future work aims to investigate this gene further using a transgenic mouse system. Our previous data (10Clark I.M. Rowan A.D. Edwards D.R. Bech-Hansen T. Mann D.A. Bahr M.J. Cawston T.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) addressed the identity of the minimal promoter for the human TIMP-1 gene, utilizing a −738/+95 fragment as our starting point. However, our genomic clone contained upstream sequences to −1718 and downstream sequences through the first intron and into exon 2 (+1188). In order to study the function of these sequences, more distal to the transcription start point, we performed deletional analyses from both 5′ and 3′ ends of a −1718/+988 construct (containing the translation start point ATG within exon 2 at the 3′ end). In order to increase expression from a CAT reporter, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the experiment, the 5′ deletion set was assessed in a +95 context (downstream sequences being highly repressive, see below). Of the 5′ sequence, the removal of the −1718/−1458 region, increased the basal expression of aCAT reporter gene by approximately 2-fold; no further differences were observed with deletions to −738. Interestingly, this region contains an Alu repeat at −1687/−1487. Alu repeats are sequences interspersed throughout the human genome with an average spacing of 5 kb, with the total number of Alu repeats estimated at more than 500,000 in the haploid human genome (18Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Mol. Gen. Metabol. 1999; 67: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Their function is unclear, but they often delineate genes, and hence, the −1687/−1487 Alu repeat may represent the 5′ boundary of the human TIMP-1 gene. Alternatively, they have been frequently identified in the regulatory regions of genes, both associated with transcriptional enhancers and silencers (19Vansant G. Reynolds W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8229-8233Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role in modulating gene expression. However, until further deletional and mutational analyses of the −1718/−1458 region are performed, the possible role of Alu in expression of the human TIMP-1 gene remains purely speculative. The addition of intron 1 to the −1718/+95 construct repressed basal expression of the CAT reporter to background levels. Since exon 1 of the TIMP-1 gene is transcribed, but not translated, with the translation start site ATG at the beginning of exon 2, we made constructs both with and without the intron 1/exon 2 junction, and with and without the exon 2 ATG: the level of expression from all of these constructs was low. We had predicted this pattern from previous studies with transgenic mice: a lacZ transgene driven by 1.3 kb of the murine Timp-1 5′-flanking sequence, exon 1 and most of intron 1 (−1350/+775 of the murine Timp-1 gene) was reported to be sufficient to reproduce the spatial and temporal expression of the Timp-1 gene during murine embryonic development (9Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); in contrast, our own studies2 showed that a transgene driven by 2.7 kb of murine Timp-1 5′-flanking DNA, part of exon 1, but lacking the intron 1 (−2700/+47), display only a subset of correct developmental expression, with inappropriate expression in sites where the Timp-1 gene itself is silent. This is despite the fact that these same sequences (−2700/+47), driving a CAT reporter in stably transfected cells, recapitulate the responses of the native gene to phorbol ester, serum, transforming growth factor-β, epidermal growth factor, and dexamethasone in vitro. The intronic sequences are therefore implicated in repression of the Timp-1 gene in the mouse, and this is supported by the fact that constructs of −2700/+775 and −223/+775 of the murine Timp-1 gene in a CAT reporter vector show greatly reduced expression compared with constructs with end points at +190. 3S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Whether the dileucine motif mediates the trafficking of GLUT4 in adipocytes is, however, the subject of much debate (18Yeh J.I. Verhey K.J. Birnbaum M.J.

In addition, the mechanisms that mediate the intracellular retention and recycling of GLUT4 to the intracellular store compartments remain essentially unknown. Here we have investigated the motifs involved in the recycling of endocytosed GLUT4 to the GSC1and study the organization and localization of this. For this purpose, we have stably expressed HA epitope-tagged wild-type GLUT4 and a GLUT4(Ser5), a mutant with the Phe5-Gln6-Gln7-Ile8motif ablated, and studied the intracellular distribution of endocytosed molecules tagged with anti-HA antibodies and the GLUT4-specific reagent Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA. The results of these studies show that the Phe5-Gln6-Gln7-Ile8motif is critical for access of endocytosed GLUT4 to the GSC where the bulk of it is stored. The GSC consists of a flat saccular structure resistant to BFA organized as a reticulum at one of the nuclear poles. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured on plastic dishes or glass coverslips in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 50 mg/liter streptomycin, 100 IU/liter penicillin, nonessential amino acids (complete medium) in a 37 °C humidified CO2 incubator. Clonal 3T3-L1 fibroblasts kept confluent for 3 days were incubated for 3–7 days in IDBX medium (1.6 × 10−5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml biotin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 500 μm 1-isobutyl 3-methylxanthine) and then with 10 –5minsulin in complete medium for different time periods as required. The fibroblasts so treated developed large lipid-droplets in their cytoplasm and will be referred henceforth as adipocyte-like (ADL) cells. ADL cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1 mm Nile blue prepared in phosphate-buffered saline to monitor the development of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. ADL cells fixed with paraformaldehyde were permeabilized for 3 min with cold (−20 °C) methanol and immunostained with specific antibodies as required for their study by immunofluorescence (IMF) microscopy. The mouse monoclonal (mAb16B12) and the rabbit polyclonal (Y11) anti-HA antibodies were from BabCO (Berkeley, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The rabbit polyclonal anti-exofacial loop antibody (pAbEL) was raised against a mixture of two peptides (NH2-CRQGPGGPDSIPQGTLTTLWA-COOH and NH2-CNAPQKVIEQSYNATWLC-COOH) that stretch out from residue 44 to residue 83 on the first large exofacial loop of GLUT4. The rabbit pAb828 was raised against the peptide representing the COOH-tail of GLUT4. These four antibodies were used to study the distribution of native and tagged GLUT4 molecules by IMF microscopy, electron microscopy, and Western analysis. Their use was conditioned by the protocols employed and the origin of the antibodies used as organelle markers (see below). Occasionally the experiments were repeated with two different anti-GLUT4 antibodies to evaluate their effects on the system under study. pAb828 was covalently bound to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to study the fraction of pAbEL bound to the GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) molecules recovered with purified LDM fractions. pAbEL was conjugated to FITC to compare the distribution of surface internalized tagged GLUT4 or GLUT4(Ser5) with Texas red-Tfn and Texas red-dextran beads. The mouse anti-His mAb, rabbit anti-Rab5b, and anti-Rab4 pAb were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit pAb against the Golgi sialoglycoprotein MG160 was a gift of Dr. Gonatas (26Gonatas J.O. Mezitis S.G. Stieber A. Fleischer B. Gonatas N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 646-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit pAb18B11 against thetrans-Golgi network marker GMPt−1 was developed in the laboratory, and its properties have been reported (27Yuan L. Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) Fluorescein and Texas-red conjugated antibodies were from Cappel (Durham, NC). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and F(ab′)2donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cDNAs of GLUT4 were cloned into the modified pPUR vector (CLONTECH) carrying the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) promoter at theApa I/Eco RI sites (20Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT4 was tagged by introducing the HA epitope after Thr78 into the GLUT4 cDNA carried in the pPUR vector (20Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ser was replaced for Phe5 by site-directed mutagenesis using as template HA-GLUT4 (29Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12866-12874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). To introduce the His tag at the COOH-end of HA-GLUT4, this was cloned into the EpiTagTM/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen, NL). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were transfected with cDNAs cloned into the pPUR vector using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (30Reeves R. Gorman C.M. Howard B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3599-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Gorman C.M. Rigby P.W. Lane D.P. Cell. 1985; 42: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Stably transfectants were selected with 7.5 μg/ml puromycin and screened for clones homogeneously expressing the transfected proteins first by IMF microscopy. Developed clones were grown in complete medium and maintained in 7.5 μg/ml puromycin. To study the stability of [35S]GLUT4 and [35S]GLUT4(Ser5)/antibody complexes within the pH 5.5–7.4 range, purified protein G-Sepharose complexes were incubated for 10 min or 1 h at 37 °C with either 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, or 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.4 or 5.5, containing100 mm NaCl and 2 mm EDTA. Intact and dissociated complexes were separated by low speed centrifugation and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and their levels were measured by autoradiography. Cell membranes from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were prepared as follows. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scrapped, and incubated for 30 min in 2 ml of 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.3, and membrane pellets were prepared by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The membranes were then solubilized for 30 min with 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (buffer A) and, after removal of the insoluble material by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min, diluted in 1 volume of buffer A without detergent. All the manipulations were performed at 4 °C. The cellular levels of GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) mutant were measured in 30 μg of membrane protein by Western analysis using the pAb828 and the ECL technique (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To study the fraction of GLUT4 exposed on the surface of stably transfected clonal 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and ADL cells, cells grown to 90% confluence on 60-mm plastic dishes were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 2 mm KCN prepared in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer prior incubation for 10 min at 37°C with or without 2.5 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) (28Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After stopping the trypsin digestion by addition of 0.1m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mg/ml of soybean inhibitor (Sigma), the cells were harvested by centrifugation at low speed and 30 μg of membrane protein, prepared as described above, and analyzed by Western blot using the anti-GLUT4 pAb828. It should be noted that the introduction of the HA tag into the large exofacial loop of GLUT4 enhanced the sensitivity of the GLUT4 molecules to trypsin. The turnover of GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) were studied in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts incubated for 30 min in methionine/cysteine-free complete medium and then labeled for 10 min or 1 h with [35S]methionine/cysteine (>1,000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before their chase for different time periods with cold complete medium (25Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effect of the inhibition of lysosomal proteases on their turnover, the cells were preincubated for 1 h with 50 mm chloroquine and 100 μg/ml leupeptine, and then the inhibitors were added to the labeling and chase medium. GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) were immunoprecipitated using the mAb16B12 and pAbEL bound to protein G -Sepharose (25Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and, after their resolution by 10% PAGE, quantitated by autoradiography. Clone 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and ADL cells stably expressing GLUT4 or the GLUT4(Ser5) mutant were incubated for time periods of 15 min, 1 h, and 18 h with 50 μg/ml of either mAb16B12 or pAbEL prepared in complete medium and, when required, washed and further incubated for different time periods in antibody-free complete medium. To biotinylate the molecules of GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) exposed onto the cell surface, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably expressing the proteins and grown on 10-mm glass coverslips were incubated with 1 mm Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA. (a gift of Dr. Geoff Holman, University of Bath, Bath, UK) prepared in 30 μl of Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer prepared (32Koumanov F. Yang J. Jones A.E. Hatanaka Y. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and UV irradiated six times for 1 min at intervals of 5 min. To investigate whether the GSC was a compartment distinct from the perinuclear recycling compartment traversed by Tfn, fibroblasts stably transfected with GLUT4 or GLUT4(Ser5) were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with FITC-pAbEL, washed, incubated for 10 min with Texas red-Tfn (50 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and then incubated for 10–50 min in plain complete medium. To study whether the endocytosed antibody-tagged GLUT4(Ser5) was downloaded into late endosomes/lysosomes, fibroblasts stably transfected with GLUT4(Ser5) were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with FITC-pAbEL and then incubated for 10 min with Texas red-dextran beads (molecular weight, 70,000; at 0.1 mg/ml; Molecular Probes), before their wash and incubation for 50 min in plain complete medium. Processing of the cells for IMF microscopy was as follows. The cells were quickly washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with cold methanol and stained with specific antibodies or streptavidin (25Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FITC and Texas red-conjugated antibodies were from Cappel (Durham, NC). FITC-conjugated streptavidin was from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). The cellular distributions of tagged GLUT4 molecules, Tfn, and dextran beads were studied by IMF microscopy using an Axiovert 135m inverted microscope (Zeiss) and a confocal Radiance 2000 microscope (Bio-Rad). The cells were photographed through fluorescence. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably expressing GLUT4 and incubated with pAbEL were processed for electron microscopy studies using the pre-embedding procedure (25Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubating the fixed/permeabilized cells for 30 min at room temperature with 0.4% H2O2 before their incubation with a HRP-conjugated F(ab′)2 donkey anti-rabbit antibody. The purification of high density (HDM) and low density microsomes (LDM) from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and ADL cells was performed as described (33Stephens J.M. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). LDM were fractionated by centrifugation on sucrose velocity gradients by a modification of a procedure described recently (34El-Jack A.K. Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1581-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Before harvesting, cells grown for 72 h on 10-cm dishes were poisoned for 5 min at room temperature with 2 mm KCN and then quickly washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Harvesting was in 2 ml of buffer 20 mm Hepes, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4 (buffer B). All the subsequent manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Cells were disrupted with 30 strokes using a Potter Evehjem homogenizer (0.08 mm clearance), and the resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. HDM were pelleted from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 ×g max, and LDM collected form the resulting supernatant by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g max for 90 min. LDM vesicles were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer B, loaded onto a 4.6 ml of 12–30% sucrose gradient prepared in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and fractionated by centrifugation at 300,000 × g max for 55 min using a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. The refractive index of the collected fractions was measured to assess the linearity of the gradients. The gradient profiles of GLUT4, GLUT4(Ser5), Rab4, Rab5b, and endocytosed pAbEL were studied by Western analysis using specific antibodies and the ECL technique. To characterize the intracellular GSC and to study the role of the Phe5-Gln6-Gln7-Ile8motif in the recycling of GLUT4 from the cell surface to the GSC, we traced the intracellular distribution of endocytosed antibody/biotin tagged GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) molecules by IMF microscopy, electron microscopy, and Western analysis. 3T3-L1 clones transfected with a modified pPUR plasmid (20Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying the GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) cDNAs (Fig.1 A) and selected for their ability to grow in puromycin were scrutinized for the capacity of their cells to express the transfected proteins by IMF microscopy using pAb828. Only clones homogeneously expressing the transfected proteins were selected for further scrutiny of their cellular levels. The cellular levels of transfected GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) were measured in clonal 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to select clones with comparable levels of the two proteins and to discard those expressing high levels that could saturate the mechanisms of GLUT4 transport. For this purpose, whole membranes were prepared from clones selected by IMF microscopy, and their content in GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) was studied by Western analysis using pAb828 and the ECL technique (Fig.1 C). The levels of the wild-type protein and the mutant were also analyzed in ADL cells differentiated from fibroblasts in vitro and used before the expression of endogenous GLUT4 (day 2 of insulin treatment; Fig. 1 B). Their study revealed that their levels remained comparable after differentiation (Fig.1 D). The levels of GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and ADL cells were also compared using a trypsin protection assay. For this purpose, cells poisoned with CNBr were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 2.5 mg/ml trypsin (28Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the digestion of GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) was studied by Western analysis using pAb828 and the ECL technique. The study showed that, in fibroblasts, the surface levels of GLUT4(Ser5), 22 ± 2%, were significantly higher than those of GLUT4, 5.5 ± 1% (Fig. 1 B). Comparable results were obtained in ADL cells as the percentage of GLUT4(Ser5) and GLUT4 were 38 ± 2 and 6.5 ± 0.5% (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, when ADL cells were preincubated for 2 h with DMEM and then for 40 min with 10−7m insulin, the levels of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane went up, as shown by the increase in its digestion by trypsin, nearly 10-fold (Fig. 1 D). Interestingly, the increase in the surface levels of GLUT4(Ser5) in response to insulin, less than 2-fold, was significantly smaller than the increase in GLUT4 (Fig. 1 D). Actively endocytosed antibodies when transported through endosomes are exposed to acidic environments that may provoke their dissociation from bound antigens (35Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The use of antibodies to study the targeting of GLUT4 from the cell surface to the GSC required, therefore, to demonstrate that HA-tagged GLUT4/antibody complexes remained stable at low pH. For this purpose, [35S]GLUT4 and [35S]GLUT4(Ser5)/antibody complexes, purified from metabolically labeled cell extracts with mAb16B12/protein G-Sepharose (Fig. 2 A), were incubated for 10 min or 1 h at 37 °C at pH 7.4, 6.4, and 5.5, and the effect of pH on their stability was studied by measuring GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) in the supernatants and pellets separated by low speed centrifugation. The results showed that GLUT4 (upper panel) and GLUT4(Ser5) (lower panel) remained bound to the antibody even at pH 5.5, a value lower than the pH measured in endosomes and typical of lysosomes (35Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Comparable results were obtained when the study was repeated using pAbEL (not shown). From these results as well as from the results of experiments performed in vivo (see Fig. 10), we concluded that mAb16B12 and pAbEL could be used to study the recycling of GLUT4 from the cell surface to the GSC.Figure 10Inactivation of the Phe5-Gln6-Gln7-Ile8Motif Increases the Turnover of GLUT4. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably expressing GLUT4 (▪) or GLUT4(Ser5) (▵, ▴) and grown to 80% confluence were metabolically labeled for 1 h (A and B) or for 10 min (C) with [35S]methionine/cysteine (>1,000 Ci/mmol) and chased for 0, 4, 8, 12, and 18 h (A). To study the effect of the inhibition of lysosomal proteases on the GLUT4(Ser5) turnover, 50 mm chloroquine and 100 μg/ml leupeptin were included during the preincubation, labeling, and chase periods (▴). Radiolabeled GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) were immunoprecipitated with mAb16B12 and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The labeling intensity of the precursor (p) and mature (m) GLUT4 and GLUT4(Ser5) species was quantitated by scanning, and the resulting values were plotted against the chase periods (B). In A, the labeling of the precursor species (0 min chase) is shown at two different exposures. The experiments shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To begin to characterize the pathway of GLUT4 recycling from the cell surface to the GSC, clonal 3T3-L1 fibroblasts either untransfected or stably expressing GLUT4 or GLUT4(Ser5) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with mAb16B12 (Fig.2 B) or pAbEL (data not shown), and the antibody recovered with the fractions enriched in LDM and HDM was studied by Western analysis using the ECL technique. The results showed that fibroblasts stably expressing GLUT4 preferentially accumulated the endocytosed antibody in LDM as compared with HDM (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, ablation of the Phe5-Gln6-Gln7-Ile8motif dramatically decreased the accumulation of the antibody in LDM vesicles (Fig. 2 B). Comparable results were obtained when the studies were repeated in ADL cells (not shown). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably expressing HA-GLUT4 immunostained with anti-GLUT4 pAb828 concentrated GLUT4 in a perinuclear structure organized as a reticulum at one of the nuclear poles, and the rest was in punctuate structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.3 A). The perinuclear compartment will be referred henceforth as the GSC, for GLUT4 storage compartment (20Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the recycling of GLUT4 from the cell surface to the GSC, fibroblasts stably transfected with GLUT4 were incubated for periods of 15 min, 1 h, and 18 h at 37 °C with 50 μg/ml of mAb16B12 or were UV irradiated in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer containing the GLUT4 affinity reagent, Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA. After treatment, the cells were washed and further incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in plain complete medium or were immediately processed for microscopy. The distribution of the tagged GLUT4 molecules was studied after cell fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with methanol. mAb16B12 was stained using FITC/HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies and Bio-LC-GLUT4 with FITC-streptavidin. The results with the two tags were comparable (Fig. 3, B and C). The bulk of mAb16B12 internalized by cells incubated for 1 h with the antibody and then for 1 h in plain complete medium was localized to a reticular structure localized to one of the poles of the nucleus, both organization and localization characteristic of the GSC (Fig. 3, compare A, B, and C). Comparable results were obtained when the incubation with the antibody was reduced to 15 min or extended to 18 h (data not shown). When after incubation with the antibody the cells were immediately processed, the antibody was localized, in addition to the perinuclear reticular structure, to numerous punctate structures preferentially clustered in the same perinuclear area (not shown). To further investigate the similarities between the compartment that retained the internalized antibody and the GSC, cells incubated for 1 h with mAb16B12 were double-stained for the antibody and the Go"
https://openalex.org/W1985087493,"The dynamin family of GTP-binding proteins has been implicated as playing an important role in endocytosis. InDrosophila shibire, mutations of the single dynamin gene cause blockade of endocytosis and neurotransmitter release, manifest as temperature-sensitive neuromuscular paralysis. Mammals express three dynamin genes: the neural specific dynamin I, ubiquitous dynamin II, and predominantly testicular dynamin III. Mutations of dynamin I result in a blockade of synaptic vesicle recycling and receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here, we show that dynamin II plays a key role in controlling constitutive and regulated hormone secretion from mouse pituitary corticotrope (AtT20) cells. Dynamin II is preferentially localized to the Golgi apparatus where it interacts with G-protein βγ subunit and regulates secretory vesicle release. The presence of dynamin II at the Golgi apparatus and its interaction with the βγ subunit are mediated by the pleckstrin homology domain of the GTPase. Overexpression of the pleckstrin homology domain, or a dynamin II mutant lacking the C-terminal SH3-binding domain, induces translocation of endogenous dynamin II from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and transformation of dynamin II from activity in the secretory pathway to receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, dynamin II regulates secretory vesicle formation from the Golgi apparatus and hormone release from mammalian neuroendocrine cells.

Mammals have at least three dynamin genes which code for dynamin I, II, and III. Although the homology between dynamin I and II proteins is 79% and between dynamin I and III proteins is 89%, significant variation occurs at the C-terminal regions. In addition, dynamin I is specifically expressed in neural tissues, whereas dynamin II is ubiquitous and dynamin III is predominantly testicular. These developmentally divergent dynamins may thus represent a large protein family apparently performing a range of functions in association with distinctive sites in mammals (1McNiven M.A. Cao I. Pitts K.R. Yoon I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).While dynamin I has been implicated as playing an important role in mediating synaptic vesicle recycling, little is known of the physiological function of dynamin II. Since dynamin I complexes a large ring-like structure surrounding the necks of clathrin-coated endocytic pits on the cytoplasmic surface of presynaptic plasma membrane during synaptic vesicle recycling (3Kelly R.B. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: E8-E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6De Camilli P. Takei K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 481-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it is thought that dynamin II plays a similar role to that of dynamin I in receptor-mediated endocytosis in non-neuronal cells (4Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 5Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L.

In support of this hypothesis are the findings that the GTPase activities of both dynamin I and II, and of their SH3-binding domain truncation mutants, are similarly stimulatedin vitro by phospholipids, grb2, and microtubules (9Lin H.C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that the modes of interaction of the PH domains from dynamin I and II with phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate and of the SH3-binding domain with microtubules and grb2 are similar in vitro (9Lin H.C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet established why dynamin I and II are concomitantly present in neurons (4Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and why rapid endocytosis in adrenal chromaffin PC12 cells is significantly inhibited by the microinjected PH domain of dynamin I but not by the PH domain of dynamin II (10Artalejo C.A. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Palfrey H.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Given the previous reports that dynamin II associates with the trans-Golgi network in human hepatic (HepG2) cells (11Maier O. Knoblich M. Westermann P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and that dynamin I and/or II immunoreactivity is present in the Golgi apparatus of human foreskin melanocytes and fibroblasts (12Henley J.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that dynamin II might have a different function in membrane trafficking from the endocytic role of dynamin I in mammalian cells (4Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To establish a biological function of dynamin II, the present study was undertaken to explore the activity of dynamin II in mouse pituitary corticotropes (AtT20 cells). We found that dynamin II plays a key role in controlling both constitutive and regulated hormone secretions at the Golgi apparatus of these neuroendocrine cells.DISCUSSIONThe present study defines for the first time dynamin II as a Golgi membrane trafficking protein required for both constitutive and regulated hormone secretion from neuroendocrine cells. A striking consequence of loss of dynamin II function in neuroendocrine cells is lowered hormone secretion with both basal and CRH-stimulated secretion of β-endorphin being affected. A similar phenotype is also found when antisense mRNA is used to block the synthesis of endogenous dynamin II. By contrast, an increase in β-endorphin secretion is observed when wild-type dynamin II is overexpressed. Thus, the extent of both constitutive and regulated hormone secretions from these neuroendocrine cells may be limited by the expression levels of endogenous dynamin II under physiological conditions. This finding is in line with previous findings that dynamin II is associated with the Golgi vesicular buddingin vitro (23Jones S.M. Howell K.E. Henley J.R. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Science. 1998; 279: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and in cultured rat epithelial cells (24Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and that microinjection of dynamin II does not mimic that of dynamin I on rapid endocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells (10Artalejo C.A. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Palfrey H.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since dynamin II has also been implicated in caveolae endocytosis in hepatocytes (25Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and receptor endocytosis in adipocytes (26Volchuk A. Narine S. Foster L.J. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8169-8176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), HeLa cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells without affecting exocytotic pathways (27Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28Kasai K. Shin H.W. Shinotsuka C. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it is possible that the cellular functions of dynamin II are largely determined by its specifically targeted subcellular localization in a cell specific fashion. Subcellular localization studies in neuroendocrine cells suggest the presence of dynamin II at the Golgi apparatus, consistent with dynamin II-regulated hormone secretion. Furthermore, overexpression of the wild type or dynamin II mutant regulates de novo production of secretory vesicles from purified Golgi apparatus and semi-permeabilized cells. Thus, dynamin II may be a major form of the dynamin family playing an obligatory role in secretory vesicle biogenesis at the Golgi apparatus during hormone secretion from neuroendocrine cells, consistent with the most recent findings that dynamin II regulates post-Golgi transport of a plasma-membrane protein (29Kreitzer G. Marmorstein A. Okamoto P. Vallee R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).In addition, structure-function analysis suggests a crucial role for the PH domain in targeting dynamin II to the Golgi. The finding that overexpressed dynamin II PH domain induces dissociation of endogenous dynamin II from the Golgi and inhibition of hormone secretion strongly suggests that the PH domain of dynamin II is involved in interacting with Golgi membrane docking molecule(s) of dynamin II. Given that PH domains from diverse proteins are capable of binding to the phosphate groups of acidic phospholipids (such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate) (30Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), it is possible that dynamin II interacts with these lipid molecules but is specifically targeted at the Golgi apparatus by protein-protein interactions involving its PH domain. In an attempt to search for dynamin II interactive proteins, we detected no interaction between dynamin II and γ-adaptin by immunoprecipitation, although previous studies have shown that dynamin I interacts with α-adaptin (31Wang L.H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and dynamin II mediates clathrin-coated vesicle budding from the TGN (23Jones S.M. Howell K.E. Henley J.R. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Science. 1998; 279: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In contrast, the interaction between dynamin II and the βγ subunit of G-proteins via the dynamin II PH domain is specific, since the small GTP-binding protein Rab6 does not coimmunoprecipitate with G-protein β subunit, nor does dynamin II with β-COP (a Golgi coatamer protein also possessing a WD40 repeat). Previous studies have also shown that purified βγ subunits bind to purified dynamin (32Liu J.-P. Yajima Y. Li H. Ackland S. Akita Y. Stewart J. Kawashima S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 132: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and stimulate secretory vesicle formation (33Barr F.A. Leyte A. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).In addition to the PH domain, our data also support a role for the SH3-binding domain in dynamin II-mediated secretory vesicle production at the Golgi apparatus. Overexpression of dynamin II lacking the SH3-binding domain not only induces dislocation of endogenous dynamin II from the Golgi but also produces inhibition of hormone secretion. The translocation of endogenous dynamin II from the Golgi to the plasma membrane suggests an involvement of the SH3-binding domain in dynamin II association with secretory vesicle membranes (Fig.10). Thus, uncoupling of the SH3-binding domain renders dynamin II ineffective in mediating secretory vesicle biogenesis, an effect paralleling previous finding for dynamin I that disruption of the SH3-binding domain impairs synaptic vesicle recycling (34Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).It is also noteworthy that the SH3-binding domain deletion mutant is more potent than the PH domain mutant in causing inhibition of hormone release (Fig. 7 A) and stimulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 7 B). This difference in potency may reflect a difference between the mutants in competing with endogenous dynamin II at the Golgi. Since the region immediately C-terminal to the PH domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase is also involved in binding to the βγ subunit (35Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Touhara K. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is possible that other regions outside the PH domain of dynamin II are also involved in targeting the protein to the Golgi, and thus that the SH3-binding domain deletion mutant is more effective than the PH domain-only mutant in causing translocation. Once on the plasma membrane, the misallocated dynamin II is capable of mediating clathrin-dependent endocytosis, suggesting that dynamin II is structurally competent to participate in both secretory and endocytic vesicular trafficking, and that its physiological role in the secretory pathway is determined by its localization to the Golgi.Collectively, these data show that dynamin II GTPase is a dominant regulator of both constitutive and regulated hormone secretions from neuroendocrine cells, operating as a polymer at the Golgi controlling secretory vesicle biogenesis. During this process, dynamin II interacts with βγ subunit of G-proteins via a region containing the PH domain; disruption of the interaction causes translocation of dynamin II from the Golgi to plasma membrane. The parallel increases and decreases in dynamin II expression with constitutive and regulated hormone secretion are consistent with expressed levels of dynamin II playing an important physiological role in regulating the capacity of cell secretion in response to environmental stimuli. Molecular targeting to particular dynamin isoforms may therefore provide a potential therapeutic means for controlling Golgi protein trafficking and hormone secretion under particular circumstances (36Shields D. Arvan P. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Dynamin is a polypeptide with a modular structure comprising a GTP-binding domain in the N-terminal third, a middle domain of unknown function, a pleckstrin homology (PH)1 domain and a C-terminal proline-rich or Src homology 3- (SH3-) binding domain (for reviews, see Refs. 1McNiven M.A. Cao I.

Mammals have at least three dynamin genes which code for dynamin I, II, and III. Although the homology between dynamin I and II proteins is 79% and between dynamin I and III proteins is 89%, significant variation occurs at the C-terminal regions. In addition, dynamin I is specifically expressed in neural tissues, whereas dynamin II is ubiquitous and dynamin III is predominantly testicular. These developmentally divergent dynamins may thus represent a large protein family apparently performing a range of functions in association with distinctive sites in mammals (1McNiven M.A. Cao I. Pitts K.R. Yoon I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). While dynamin I has been implicated as playing an important role in mediating synaptic vesicle recycling, little is known of the physiological function of dynamin II. Since dynamin I complexes a large ring-like structure surrounding the necks of clathrin-coated endocytic pits on the cytoplasmic surface of presynaptic plasma membrane during synaptic vesicle recycling (3Kelly R.B. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: E8-E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6De Camilli P. Takei K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 481-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it is thought that dynamin II plays a similar role to that of dynamin I in receptor-mediated endocytosis in non-neuronal cells (4Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 5Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L.

In support of this hypothesis are the findings that the GTPase activities of both dynamin I and II, and of their SH3-binding domain truncation mutants, are similarly stimulatedin vitro by phospholipids, grb2, and microtubules (9Lin H.C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that the modes of interaction of the PH domains from dynamin I and II with phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate and of the SH3-binding domain with microtubules and grb2 are similar in vitro (9Lin H.C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet established why dynamin I and II are concomitantly present in neurons (4Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and why rapid endocytosis in adrenal chromaffin PC12 cells is significantly inhibited by the microinjected PH domain of dynamin I but not by the PH domain of dynamin II (10Artalejo C.A. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Palfrey H.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Given the previous reports that dynamin II associates with the trans-Golgi network in human hepatic (HepG2) cells (11Maier O. Knoblich M. Westermann P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and that dynamin I and/or II immunoreactivity is present in the Golgi apparatus of human foreskin melanocytes and fibroblasts (12Henley J.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that dynamin II might have a different function in membrane trafficking from the endocytic role of dynamin I in mammalian cells (4Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To establish a biological function of dynamin II, the present study was undertaken to explore the activity of dynamin II in mouse pituitary corticotropes (AtT20 cells). We found that dynamin II plays a key role in controlling both constitutive and regulated hormone secretions at the Golgi apparatus of these neuroendocrine cells. DISCUSSIONThe present study defines for the first time dynamin II as a Golgi membrane trafficking protein required for both constitutive and regulated hormone secretion from neuroendocrine cells. A striking consequence of loss of dynamin II function in neuroendocrine cells is lowered hormone secretion with both basal and CRH-stimulated secretion of β-endorphin being affected. A similar phenotype is also found when antisense mRNA is used to block the synthesis of endogenous dynamin II.

Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that the SH3-binding domain deletion mutant is more potent than the PH domain mutant in causing inhibition of hormone release (Fig. 7 A) and stimulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 7 B). This difference in potency may reflect a difference between the mutants in competing with endogenous dynamin II at the Golgi. Since the region immediately C-terminal to the PH domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase is also involved in binding to the βγ subunit (35Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Touhara K. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is possible that other regions outside the PH domain of dynamin II are also involved in targeting the protein to the Golgi, and thus that the SH3-binding domain deletion mutant is more effective than the PH domain-only mutant in causing translocation. Once on the plasma membrane, the misallocated dynamin II is capable of mediating clathrin-dependent endocytosis, suggesting that dynamin II is structurally competent to participate in both secretory and endocytic vesicular trafficking, and that its physiological role in the secretory pathway is determined by its localization to the Golgi. Collectively, these data show that dynamin II GTPase is a dominant regulator of both constitutive and regulated hormone secretions from neuroendocrine cells, operating as a polymer at the Golgi controlling secretory vesicle biogenesis. During this process, dynamin II interacts with βγ subunit of G-proteins via a region containing the PH domain; disruption of the interaction causes translocation of dynamin II from the Golgi to plasma membrane. The parallel increases and decreases in dynamin II expression with constitutive and regulated hormone secretion are consistent with expressed levels of dynamin II playing an important physiological role in regulating the capacity of cell secretion in response to environmental stimuli. Molecular targeting to particular dynamin isoforms may therefore provide a potential therapeutic means for controlling Golgi protein trafficking and hormone secretion under particular circumstances (36Shields D. Arvan P. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1999; 11: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We thank S. Kawashima, P. J. Robinson, and T. C. Sudhof for materials and advice, D. Autelitano and R.

Shifts in the frequency and intensity of severe weather (events lasting hours or days) and climate extremes (events persisting for months or years) could exacerbate this growing problem. Most assessments of recent increases in losses, such as from El Niño 1997 (1), point to society and human behavior as the primary cause. Growth of population and wealth, as well as demographic shifts to coastal areas and to expanding metropolitan areas, have collectively increased the vulnerability of the United States to losses from weather extremes (2)."

Modeling the transition state of the chemical step from the structure of the enzyme-product complex Y-PPase·Mn2(MnPi)2 has led to two models that differ in the identity of the water nucleophile placed between metal ions M1 and M2 in the model of Heikinheimo et al.

Although the former model requires an additional “relaxation” step, in which a new water molecule displaces Pi oxygen from the position between M1 and M2, it has an advantage of providing an efficient mechanism for nucleophile activation through combined action of the two metal ions and an adjacent Asp117 residue (see Fig. 1). In aqueous solution and even in crystalline state, proteins are surrounded with water shells, making identification of function-related water molecules a difficult task. Use of fluoride, a potent and most specific inhibitor of cytoplasmic pyrophosphatase, provides a convenient approach to detect such water molecules because molecules of HF and H2O are isoelectronic and of similar size, as are the anions derived therefrom. Fluoride inhibition of yeast PPase during PPi hydrolysis and synthesis involves a rapid and slow phases (10Smirnova I.N. Baykov A.A. Biokhimiya. 1983; 48: 1643-1653PubMed Google Scholar), which refer to F− binding to enzyme-Pi and enzyme-PPi intermediates, respectively (Scheme FSI). The rapid binding decelerates PPi hydrolysis 10-fold at pH 7.2, whereas the slow binding arrests it completely. These characteristics of the inhibition are consistent with fluoride replacing an essential metal-bound water molecule/OH− ion, acting as nucleophile in the PPi hydrolysis step (11Baykov A.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11939-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present work, we employed fluoride inhibition in combination with site-directed mutagenesis to identify the fluoride binding site and, hence, the essential water molecule in the active site of PPase. Because fluoride inhibition of Y-PPase is closely associated with Mg2+ binding (10Smirnova I.N. Baykov A.A. Biokhimiya. 1983; 48: 1643-1653PubMed Google Scholar, 12Baykov A.A. Tam-Villoslado J.J.

A Y93F variant was also included in this list, because in the PPase mechanism suggested by Harutyunyan et al. (9Harutyunyan E.H. Oganessyan V.Yu. Oganessyan N.N. Avaeva S.M. Nazarova T.I.

The assay medium used to measure fluoride effects on PPase in the presence of Pi contained 13.4 mm MgCl2 (5 mm free Mg2+), 20 mm total Pi, 55 mm TES/KOH buffer, 11 mm KCl, and 33 μm EGTA. Mg2+ binding was assayed by equilibrium microdialysis in combination with atomic absorption spectroscopy to measure Mg content in the dialysis chambers (20Käpylä J. Hyytiä T. Lahti R. Goldman A.

Effects of fluoride on PPi hydrolysis were analyzed in terms of Scheme FSII, a simplified version of Scheme FSI. KF1 is the dissociation constant governing rapid fluoride binding in the presence of PPi, ki , app and kr are the second-order and first-order rate constants for slow fluoride binding and release, respectively. Equations 1 and 2 describe product (P) formation curves at a fixed fluoride concentration, where α is the fraction of enzyme that has not yet undergone slow conversion into Einactive, and v0, appis the initial velocity of product formation.dαdt=kr(1−α)−ki,app[F]αEquation 1 d[P]dt=v0,appαEquation 2 Fitting [P] as a function of both time and [F] was accomplished by making the following substitutions (v0 and v0′ are the initial velocities of product formation observed at [F] equal to zero and infinity, respectively).v0,app=v0′+v0−v0′1+[F]/KF1Equation 3 ki,app=ki1+[F]/KF1Equation 4 Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 were simultaneously fit, with the program SCIENTIST (MicroMath), to sets of product formation curves, each represented by 90–200 pairs of [P] and t values. The calculated and measured curves agreed within 3%. Values of the dissociation constants KM 1and KM 2 for Mg2+ binding to two sites on Y-PPase were estimated by fitting equilibrium dialysis data to Equation 5, where n measures the number of Mg2+ ions bound per monomer (21Belogurov G.A.

Interestingly, every substitution suppressed Mg2+ binding to the low affinity site, the lowest (1.8-fold) effect seen with Y93F, and the highest (147-fold) with E48D substitutions (TableI). Binding of Mg2+ to the high affinity site was markedly suppressed in both Asp120variants (34- and 16-fold effects with D120E and D120N, respectively) and less markedly (4.0-fold effect) in the D152E variant. These data are consistent with M1 being the high affinity site and M2 being the low affinity site, as measured by equilibrium dialysis.Table IDissociation constants for Mg 2+ binding at pH 7.2Enzyme variantKM 1KM 2μmμmWT0.7 ± 0.134 ± 6WT1-aIn the presence of 10 mm NaF.1.4 ± 0.320 ± 3E48D0.7 ± 0.15000 ± 1000Y93F0.7 ± 0.160 ± 10D115E0.8 ± 0.1400 ± 100D117E1.4 ± 0.1170 ± 50D120E24 ± 22800 ± 700D120N11 ± 11400 ± 200D152E2.8 ± 0.21700 ± 5001-a In the presence of 10 mm NaF.

The E48D variant, which exhibited the highest KM 2 value (5.0 mm), is expected to be 50% saturated at the M2 site in the absence of substrate, but keeping in mind that substrate strengthens metal ion binding to the corresponding E-PPase E20D variant (22Volk S.E.

Group I variants (E48D, Y93F, D115E, and D117E) resembled WT-Y-PPase (11Baykov A.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R.

The group II variant (D120E at pH 7.2) exhibited only slow inactivation, without the instant decrease in the initial slope, and the group III variant (D152E) exhibited only instant inactivation. At pH 8.5, D120E-PPase also behaved like a group III member, whereas other variants did not change their behavior. It should be noted that the Pi productions curves look very similar for group I and group II variants (Fig. 3), and they could be only distinguished based on the fitting results shown below; the best-fit value of KF1 tended to approach infinity for D120E-PPase, clearly indicating no change in v0,app in the presence of fluoride. Values for the rate constants ki and kr describing the slow phase of the inhibition and for the equilibrium constant KF1describing the fast step of the inhibition (Scheme FSII) were obtained by simultaneous fitting of Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 to series of product formation curves measured at different fluoride concentrations. The most drastic effects were observed on ki with the D117E and D152E variants (the latter exhibited no slow inactivation step at any pH value), on kr with the D115E and D120E variants, and on KF1 with the D117E variant (TableIII).Table IIIParameters for fluoride inhibition of PP i hydrolysisEnzyme variantpHkikrKF 23-aK F 2 =kr /ki .KF 1k′cat/kcatmm −1 min −1min −1mmmmWT7.22.5 ± 0.3≤0.02≤0.0082.6 ± 0.20.05 ± 0.01E48D7.22.7 ± 0.20.07 ± 0.010.025 ± 0.0052.0 ± 0.1≤0.02Y93E7.20.83 ± 0.04≤0.03≤0.0365.3 ± 0.3≤0.02D115E7.25.0 ± 0.40.34 ± 0.040.07 ± 0.010.74 ± 0.03≤0.02D117E7.20.054 ± 0.003≤0.01≤0.250 ± 10≤0.1D117E3-bMeasured with 50 μmMg2PPi.7.20.06 ± 0.02≤0.01≤0.235 ± 10≤0.1D120E7.22.8 ± 0.10.19 ± 0.040.07 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.02D152E3-cThis variant exhibited no slow inactivation step.7.22.7 ± 0.1≤0.02WT8.50.86 ± 0.03≤0.03≤0.0357.1 ± 0.2≤0.02E48D8.51.8 ± 0.2≤0.03≤0.0173.1 ± 0.2≤0.02Y93E8.50.62 ± 0.05≤0.03≤0.058.5 ± 0.6≤0.02D115E8.52.0 ± 0.20.23 ± 0.040.12 ± 0.023.9 ± 0.4≤0.02D117E8.50.07 ± 0.01≤0.01≤0.1430 ± 5≤0.1D120E3-cThis variant exhibited no slow inactivation step.8.544 ± 5≤0.1D152E3-cThis variant exhibited no slow inactivation step.8.52.5 ± 0.3≤0.023-a K F 2 =kr /ki .3-b Measured with 50 μmMg2PPi.3-c This variant exhibited no slow inactivation step.

This remarkable feature of the active site was completely retained in D117E and D120E variants, partially retained in the D48E, Y93F, and D115E variants and almost completely lost in the D152E variant (TableII and Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, addition of 2 mm fluoride to E48D, Y93F, and D115E variants at pH 7.2 caused a rapid decrease in enzyme-bound PPi, not resolved in time (F−binding to enzyme-Pi complex in Scheme FSI), followed by a slow increase to a higher level (F− binding to enzyme-PPi complex) (Fig. 4), like in wild type Y-PPase (11Baykov A.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11939-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The time course of the slow increase could be described by Equations 8 and 9 (11Baykov A.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R.

Fluoride binding was assumed to be a second-order reaction (see also below).fepp=feppslow+feppfast(100−feppslow)/100Equation 8 dfeppslowdt=ki,app[F−](100−feppslow)−krfeppslowEquation 9 For the D117E and D120E variants, the initial decrease in fepp could be resolved in time. Moreover, no slow increase in fepp followed after its rapid drop in the D120E variant. Values of ki , app, kr , and feppfast for the D117E variant were obtained with Equations 8 and 9 using the points collected at t ≥ 2 min on the curve shown in Fig. 4. The curve for the D120E variant and the initial part of the curve for the D117E variant (t ≤ 2 min) could be described by Equations 10 and 11 for a reversible binding, where r is the percentage of fraction of enzyme-Picomplex containing bound fluoride and the primed rate constants refer to F− binding to and release from enzyme-Picomplex. As the enzyme-Pi complex binds two fluoride ions (see below), Equation 11 contains the second power of fluoride concentration.

Open table in a new tab Upon the incubation with Pi and F− at pH 7.2, the variant PPases were diluted 900–4500-fold into assay medium, and the initial velocity of PPi hydrolysis was estimated from the slope of the Pi production curve 1 min after the dilution (the dead-time of the Pi analyzer increased by comparison with Fig. 3because of the Pi present in the enzyme solution). The extensive dilution and the 1-min delay were expected to completely reverse the fast fluoride binding step seen in Fig. 4 for the E48D, Y93E, and D115E variants and to partially reverse the slower initial binding step observed with the D120E and D117E variants. In agreement with the data reported above, the preincubation with fluoride did not affect the activity of the D152E variant, slightly inactivated the D115E and D120E variants and more deeply inactivated the E48D, Y93E, and D117E variants (Figs. 5 and6). Low degree of the inactivation seen with the D115E variant is consistent with its high kr value (Table IV). For all the variants, the degree of the inactivation observed after 80 min was smaller than for wild type Y-PPase (11Baykov A.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11939-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), consistent with lower ki , app or higher kr value (Table IV). The values of these parameters estimated with Equation 1 for the two variants exhibiting >30% inactivation in Figs. 5 and 6 (Y93F and D117E) were similar to those derived from Fig. 4 (Table IV). For the D117E variant, only points with t > 5 min were used in this estimation.Figure 6Inactivation of D117E-PPase during incubation with F− in the presence of 20 mmPi and 5 mm Mg2+ at pH 7.2.F− concentrations in mmol/liter are shown at the curves.

https://openalex.org/W1972573914,"Abstract Degradation of trans-unsaturated fatty acids was studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Propagation of yeast cells on trans-9 elaidic acid medium resulted in transcriptional up-regulation of theSPS19 gene, whose promoter contains an oleate response element. This up-regulation depended on the Pip2p-Oaf1p transcription factor and was accompanied by induction of import-competent peroxisomes. Utilization of trans fatty acids as a single carbon and energy source was evaluated by monitoring the formation of clear zones around cell growth on turbid media containing fatty acids dispersed with Tween 80. For metabolizing odd-numberedtrans double bonds, cells required the β-oxidation auxiliary enzyme Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase Eci1p. Metabolism of the corresponding even-numbered double bonds proceeded in the absence of Sps19p (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase) and Dci1p (Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase).trans-2,trans-4-Dienoyl-CoAs could enter β-oxidation directly via Fox2p (2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 andd-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) without the involvement of Sps19p, whereastrans-2,cis-4-dienoyl-CoAs could not. This reductase-independent metabolism oftrans-2,trans-4-dienoyl-CoAs resembled the situation postulated for mammalian mitochondria in which oleic acid is degraded through a di-isomerase-dependent pathway. In this hypothetical process,trans-2,trans-4-dienoyl-CoA metabolites are generated by Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase and Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase and are degraded by 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 in the absence of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. Growth of a yeast fox2sps19Δ mutant in which Fox2p was exchanged with rat peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme type 1 ontrans-9,trans-12 linolelaidic acid medium gave credence to this theory. We propose an amendment to the current scheme of the carbon flux through β-oxidation taking into account the dispensability of β-oxidation auxiliary enzymes for metabolizingtrans double bonds at even-numbered positions."

The rate constant for inactivation (k obs) exhibits a nonlinear dependence on reagent concentration withK I = 71 μm andk max = 0.0133 min−1. Complete protection against inactivation is provided by 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate, whereas Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione andS-methylglutathione have little effect onk obs. These results indicate that 17β-iodoacetoxy-estradiol-3-sulfate reacts as an affinity label of the nonsubstrate steroid site rather than of the substrate sites occupied by Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione or glutathione. Loss of activity occurs concomitant with incorporation of about 1 mol14C-labeled reagent/mol enzyme dimer when the enzyme is maximally inactivated. Isolation of the labeled peptide from the chymotryptic digest shows that Cys17 is the only enzymic amino acid modified.

These results and examination of the crystal structure of the enzyme suggest that the interaction between the two subunits of glutathione S-transferase 1-1, and the electrostatic attraction between the 3-sulfate of the reagent and Arg14 of subunit B, are important in binding steroid sulfates at the nonsubstrate steroid binding site and in determining the specificity of this affinity label.

These conjugation products are more water-soluble than the xenobiotic substrates, and they can be further degraded or transported out of the cell. GlutathioneS-transferases have been found in elevated levels within cancerous tumors and have been implicated in the development of resistance to anti-cancer drugs (5Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). The cytosolic enzymes are now grouped into seven classes and within a particular class they can exist as either homo- or heterodimers (1Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res.

Each subunit of the dimer contains a glutathione-binding site and a xenobiotic site that can accommodate a wide variety of compounds. Isozyme 1-1, 2Glutathione S-transferase, isozyme 1-1, is designated as the rGSTA1,2 isozyme in the nomenclature of Hayes and Pulford (5Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). a member of the α class, efficiently catalyzes the isomerization reaction of Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione to Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione, which it binds at the substrate steroid site (13Benson A.M. Talalay P. Keen J.H. Jakoby W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition to this site, isozyme 1-1 also has a nonsubstrate steroid binding site that is located in the cleft between the two subunits (14Hu L. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1635-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Barycki J.J. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This site has been proposed to fulfill a transport function (5Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar) or to act in controlling levels of steroids in target organs (16Listowsky I. Structure and Function of Glutathione S-transferases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 199-209Google Scholar). The nonsubstrate site has a preference for steroid sulfates, which is illustrated by the more potent inhibitory effect of 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate as compared with that of 17β-estradiol. However, previous work in this laboratory (aimed at locating the nonsubstrate site) used the affinity label 3β-(iodoacetoxy)dehydroisoandrosterone (3β-IDA) (shown in Fig. 1), which is structurally related both to substrates of the enzyme, such as Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione, and to inhibitors of the enzyme, such as Δ5-androstene-3β,17β-diol disulfate and 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate. The 3β-IDA modified Cys17 and Cys111 equally with an incorporation of 1 mol of reagent/mol enzyme subunit; analysis of molecular models suggested that the binding site of 3β-IDA is located in the cleft between the subunits (15Barycki J.J. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on the previous data, we have now designed a more specific affinity label for the nonsubstrate steroid site: 17β-iodoacetoxy-estradiol-3-sulfate (17β-IES). This new compound features the negatively charged sulfate that should enhance and direct its binding and a reactive iodoacetoxy group at a position at the opposite end of the molecule from that of 3β-IDA (Fig. 1). The iodide can be displaced from the iodoacetoxy group by nucleophilic attack by the side chains of several amino acids including Cys, Asp, Lys, Met, and His (17Wilchek M. Givol D. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 46: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that this affinity label reacts specifically with Cys17 at a single subunit of the enzyme dimer. Molecular modeling studies support the location of the nonsubstrate binding site within the cleft and the contribution of the sulfate moiety in orienting the ligand within the cleft. A preliminary version of this work has been presented (18Vargo M.A. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1544Google Scholar).

Glutathione S-transferase isozyme 1-1 was purified from rat livers using affinity column chromatography on S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose (19Wang J. Barycki J.J. Colman R.F.

(21Pons M. Nicolas J.C. Boussioux A.M. Descombs B. Crastes de Paulet A. FEBS Lett. 1973; 36: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One molar equivalent of 17β-estradiol-3-sulfate, 1.1 molar equivalents of iodoacetic acid, and 2 molar equivalents of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide were combined in 15 ml of cellosolve. (For the radioactively labeled compound before addition to the reaction mixture, 125 μCi of radioactive iodoacetic acid was added to 0.83 mmol of unlabeled iodoacetic acid in a total of 5 ml.) The reaction was initiated by the addition of a catalytic amount of pyridine (250 μl), and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 ml of distilled water, and the mixture was centrifuged to remove the insoluble dicyclohexylurea. The organic layer, containing 17β-IES, was lyophilized. The product was resuspended in 100 μl of acetonitrile and was brought to a final volume of 1 ml by the addition of distilled water. The 17β-IES was purified by HPLC using a Varian 5000LC equipped with a Vydac C18 column (1 × 25 cm) and a UV-100 detector. The solvent system used was H2O (Solvent A) and acetonitrile (Solvent B). The column was equilibrated with solvent A containing 10% solvent B. After 10 min at 10% solvent B, a linear gradient was run to 100% B in 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 275 nm and 17β-IES eluted at ∼28 min. For comparison, the starting material, 17β-estradiol-3-sulfate, elutes at ∼23 min. For the radioactively labeled compound, the specific radioactivity was 2.17 × 1011 cpm/mol. The product has a UV absorption spectrum with a maximum at 260 nm and a shoulder at 270 nm. The extinction coefficient at 260 nm was measured to be 1810m−1 cm−1, with the concentration determined from the specific radioactivity. Enzymatic activity was measured by using a Hewlett Packard 8453 UV-VIS Spectrophotometer and monitoring the formation of the glutathione (2.5 mm in assay) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (1 mm in assay) conjugate at 340 nm (Δε = 9.6 mm−1cm−1) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 25 °C according to Habig et al. (22Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (0.2 mg/ml, 7.8 μm enzyme subunits) was incubated in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C with various concentrations of 17β-IES. Control enzyme samples were incubated under the same conditions but without 17β-IES. At various time points, an aliquot was removed from the incubation mixture, diluted, and assayed (30 μl) for residual activity. Glutathione S-transferase (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated with 500 μm [14C]17β-IES at pH 7.0 under standard reaction conditions. Aliquots were withdrawn at various times, and excess reagent was removed by the gel centrifugation method using two successive Sephadex G-50 columns (5 ml) equilibrated with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (23Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The protein concentration in the filtrate was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, based on the Bradford method, using a Bio-Rad 2550 RIA plate reader with a 600-nm filter (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Unmodified GST 1-1 was used to generate the standard concentration curve. The amount of reagent present was determined by radioactivity using a Packard 1500 Liquid scintillation counter. Incorporation was expressed as mol 17β-IES/mol of enzyme subunit. Glutathione S-transferase (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated with 500 μm14C-labeled 17β-IES at pH 7.0 under standard reaction conditions for 3 h, at which time the enzyme was maximally inactivated. Excess reagent was removed as described above. Solid guanidine HCl was added to make a 5 m guanidine-HCl solution and was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to denature the protein, followed by treatment with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide at 25 °C for 30 min to block free cysteine residues. The solution was then dialyzed against 6 liters of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, at 4 °C with one change for a total of 18 h, after which the sample was lyophilized. The enzyme was solubilized by adding 250 μl of 8 m urea in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. The solution was then diluted with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate to bring the final concentration of urea to 2 m. Chymotrypsin was added (10% w/w) at 2 h intervals while incubating at 37 °C. The ester bond between the iodoacetic acid and estradiol-3-sulfate was subsequently hydrolyzed by adding 2 n NaOH to yield 0.2 n NaOH and then incubating the enzyme digest at 25 °C for 2 h. The solution was then neutralized by adding HCl to yield 0.2 n. The solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, with no loss of radioactivity and was subjected to HPLC. The chymotryptic peptides were fractionated by a Varian 5000 LC equipped with a Vydac C18 reverse-phase column equilibrated with Solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water). At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the peptides were separated by a linear gradient from 0% to 20% Solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) in 100 min followed by a linear gradient to 100% Solvent B in 30 min. The eluate was monitored by A 220, and 1-ml fractions were collected. An aliquot (300 μl) from each fraction was added to 5 ml of Liquiscint to test for radioactivity. The amino acid sequences of purified peptides were determined on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas phase protein/peptide sequencer, equipped with a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Molecular modeling was conducted using the Insight II modeling package from Molecular Simulations, Inc. on an Indigo 2 work station from Silicon Graphics. The model of rat GST 1-1 was constructed as described previously (19Wang J. Barycki J.J. Colman R.F. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) based on the known crystal structure of human liver isozyme 1-1 (1GUH). The structure of 17β-IES was constructed using the Builder module. Docking of 17β-IES was done manually based on the energy minimized structure of 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate docked into isozyme 1-1 (15Barycki J.J. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Incubation of rat GST 1-1 (0.2 mg/ml, 7.8 μmenzyme subunits), with 300 μm 17β-IES, when assayed with 1-chloro-2,4 dinitrobenzene, results in a time-dependent loss of enzyme activity that reaches a limit of 60% of the original activity, as is illustrated in Fig.2 A. After 180 min, excess reagent was removed, and a second addition of 300 μm17β-IES was added; no further decrease in activity occurred. Because the activity levels off at 60% at long incubation times and over a range of 17β-IES concentrations, the data were calculated using 60% as the end point (Fig. 2 B). Control enzyme incubated under the same conditions but with no reagent present shows no loss of activity. The k obs for inactivation was calculated from the slope of ln([E t −E ∞]/[E 0 −E ∞]) versus time whereE t is the enzyme activity at time t,E 0 is the original enzyme activity, andE ∞ is the enzyme activity at long times, which is equal to 0.6 (E 0). The reaction obeys pseudo-first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.0125 min−1 (Fig. 2 B). GST 1-1 (0.2 mg/ml, 7.8 μm enzyme subunits) was incubated with 20–300 μm of 17β-IES as described above, to determine the rate of inactivation at various reagent concentrations (Fig.3). The apparent rate constantk obs exhibits a nonlinear dependence on reagent concentration. This type of curve is typical of an affinity label, suggesting that a reversible enzyme-reagent complex is formed prior to the irreversible modifcation of the enzyme (26Colman, R. F. (1997) in Protein Function: A Practical Approach, 2nd Ed, Chapter 16, pp. 155–183, Oxford University Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The curve can be described by the equation k obs =k max/(1 + K I /[17β-IES]), where K I is the apparent dissociation constant of the enzyme-reagent complex, and k max is the maximum rate of inactivation at saturating concentrations of the reagent. A least squares fit of the observed data yieldsK I = 71.4 μm andk max = 0.0133 min−1. Various ligand analogues were added to the reaction mixture to determine whether they could protect against the inactivation of the enzyme by 100 μm 17β-IES. The results, given in Table I, are expressed as k +L/k −L, wherek +L is the rate constant for inactivation in the presence of a particular ligand, and k −L is the rate constant for inactivation in the absence of a particular ligand. Glutathione derivatives (Table I, lines 2 and 3) offer some protection, with the protective effect increasing with an increase in alkyl chain length. The 5 mm concentrations used are sufficient to saturate the glutathione site, yetk +L/k −L does not decrease below 0.37. These results suggest that the target site of 17β-IES is near the glutathione site but distinct from it. Electrophilic substrates, such as Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione (Table I, line 4), do not provide any protection. In contrast, including steroid sulfates, such as 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate, cause a striking decrease in the observed inactivation rate constant (lines 5–10). Because these steroid sulfates are known to bind at a nonsubstrate steroid site (15Barycki J.J. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the results indicate that 17β-IES is reacting within this nonsubstrate steroid binding site.Table IEffects of enzyme ligands on the inactivation of glutathione S-transferase by 300 μm 17β-IESLigand addedk +L/k −L 1-ak+L/k −Lwas determined by the ratio of initial inactivation rate with ligand present to that observed in the absence of ligand. 1.None1.00 2.S-Methyl glutathione (5 mm)0.74 3.S-Hexyl glutathione (5 mm)0.37 4.Δ5-Androstene-3,17-dione (500 μm)1.00 5.17β-Estradiol-3-sulfate (100 μm)0.40 6.17β-Estradiol-3-sulfate (500 μm)0.25 7.17β-Estradiol-17-sulfate (100 μm)0.45 8.17β-Estradiol-17-sulfate (500 μm)0.14 9.17β-Estradiol-3,17-disulfate (100 μm)0.3010.17β-Estradiol-3,17-disulfate (500 μm)0.00The inactivation reaction was conducted at 37 °C in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5.1-a k+L/k −Lwas determined by the ratio of initial inactivation rate with ligand present to that observed in the absence of ligand. Open table in a new tab The inactivation reaction was conducted at 37 °C in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. GST 1-1 (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated with 300 μm[14C]17β-IES. A time-dependent incorporation of [14C]17β-IES was observed concomitant with the decrease in enzyme activity. A plot of the percentage of maximum inactivation versus net incorporation (Fig.4) extrapolates to ∼0.5 mol of14C-labeled reagent incorporated per mol of enzyme subunit or 1 mol/enzyme dimer at 100% of maximum inactivation. Maximally inactivated GST 1-1 was prepared and digested with chymotrypsin. The digest was fractionated by HPLC using a reverse-phase column (C18) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and an acetonitrile gradient (Fig.5). One radioactive peptide peak was observed on HPLC. Because the ester linkage of 17β-IES (Fig. 1) was hydrolyzed before the digest was applied to HPLC, the steroid moiety was removed, and the peptide is expected to be labeled with the radioactive carboxymethyl group. The fractions corresponding to this peak were pooled, lyophilized, and subjected to gas phase amino acid sequencing. The results are shown in TableII. The sequence Glu-Xaa-Ile-Arg-Trp corresponds to residues 16–20 in the known amino acid sequence. None of the common phenylthiohydantoin derivatives was detected in cycle 2; instead, there was a peak with a retention time between that of phenylthiohydantoin-Ser and phenylthiohydantoin-Asn. This peak corresponds to that of a phenylthiohydantoin-carboxymethylcysteine standard, indicating that a Cys in this position had been modified. Thus, Cys17 of GST1-1 is the amino acid target of 17β-IES.Table IIRepresentative sequence of modified peptide (Peak I) isolated from the chymotryptic digest of 14 C-labeled glutathione S-transferase 1–1, as illustrated by Fig. 5CycleAmino acidpmol1Glu (141)2Xaa 2-aRetention time is 7.8 min between PTH-Asn and PTH-Ser.3Ile (37)4Arg (34)5Trp (14)2-a Retention time is 7.8 min between PTH-Asn and PTH-Ser. Open table in a new tab 17β-Iodoacetoxy-estradiol-3-sulfate acts as an affinity label of rat liver glutathione S-transferase isozyme 1-1. Upon incubation of the enzyme with 17β-IES, a time-dependent loss of activity is observed, yielding a maximum loss of 40% of the original activity. The rate of inactivation exhibits nonlinear dependence on reagent concentration, as is typical of an affinity label, for which an enzyme-reagent complex forms prior to irreversible modification. Partial protection against inactivation is provided by glutathione derivatives; long chain derivatives, such asS-hexylglutathione, provide more protection than do shorter chain derivatives, like S-methylglutathione, indicating that 17β-IES is binding in a site close to the glutathione site but not within the site. Electrophilic substrate analogues, such as Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione, do not offer any protection, demonstrating that 17β-IES does not bind within the electrophilic substrate site. Steroid sulfates are most effective in protecting against inactivation of GST, 1-1, with 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate providing complete protection. These results indicate that 17β-IES is binding and reacting within the nonsubstrate steroid binding site. Upon maximum inactivation, about 0.5 mol of reagent is incorporated per mol enzyme subunit or 1 mol of 17β-IES/enzyme dimer, and Cys17 is the only amino acid that is modified. In previous work, based on the crystal structure of glutathioneS-transferase from the parasitic worm Schistosoma japonica in complex with praziquantel, an anti-schistosomal drug bound in the cleft between the subunits, only 1 mol of praziquantel is bound per mol of enzyme dimer (27McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling of rat liver GST 1-1 by glutathionyl S-[4-(succinimidyl)-benzophenone] also results in one subunit being modified (28Wang J. Bauman S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5493-5503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Other precedence for binding only 1 mol reagent/mol enzyme dimer comes from work with large conjugation products, such asS-[[(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxy-3-pyrrolidinyl)-carbamoyl]methyl]glutathione (29Schramm V.L. McCluskey R. Emig F.A. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 714-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the aflatoxin glutathione conjugate, 8,9-dihydro-8-(S-glutathionyl)-9-hydroxyl-aflatoxin, which bind to α class glutathione S-transferases with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol dimer (25McHugh T.E. Atkins W.M. Racha J.K. Kunze K.L. Eaton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27470-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the case of glutathionylS-[4-(succinimidyl)benzophenone), only one subunit is modified, yet the enzyme is completely inactivated. The modification of one subunit thus can abolish the enzyme activity of both subunits and, because this label does not occupy the nonsubstrate site, the inhibition is probably the result of a subtle conformational change rather than a physical barrier to the binding of the substrate (28Wang J. Bauman S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5493-5503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There is also complete inactivation by the aflatoxin conjugate, although in this case, the bound conjugate extends into the cleft and therefore may be inhibiting completely either because it is blocking access to the active site of the unmodified subunit or because it induces a conformational change (25McHugh T.E. Atkins W.M. Racha J.K. Kunze K.L. Eaton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27470-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present case, maximum reaction with 17β-IES results in the loss of only 40% of activity; it is likely that the unmodified subunit retains full activity, whereas the other subunit with modified Cys17 is 80% inactive. Incorporation of 17β-IES on one subunit apparently prevents a second molecule from binding to and reacting with the other subunit, but, in contrast to the previous examples, this does not cause complete inactivation of both subunits. The 17β-IES reacts at the steroid site, which is distinct from the active site, and thus there is still some residual activity in the modified subunit, whereas the catalytic site on the other subunit functions independently and is completely active. These results indicate that the observation of apparent cooperativity between the subunits of glutathione S-transferase depends on the particular binding site that is being examined. A homology model for the rat 1-1 isozyme was generated from the crystal structure of the human glutathione S-transferase 1-1. The reagent was manually docked into the model based on an energy-minimized structure of 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate bound to GST 1-1 and the assumptions that the iodoacetoxy group of the 17β-IES must be close to the sulfhydryl group of Cys17 as well as in an orientation to modify only one subunit. The structure shown in Fig.6 meets these requirements. In the proposed model, there is 1 mol of 17β-IES bound in the cleft between the subunits of the enzyme. The reactive iodoacetoxy group is about 3.4 Å from the sulfhydryl group of CysA17. This orientation prevents a second molecule from reacting at Cys17 on subunit B. 17β-IES appears to bind more specifically than does 3β-(iodoacetoxy)dehydroisoandrosterone, which modified both Cys17 and Cys111 (15Barycki J.J. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of 3β-IDA, reaction at the two sites were mutually exclusive,i.e. reaction with Cys17 on one subunit excludes binding and reaction with Cys17 on the other subunit. We now propose that the more specific reaction of 17β-IES with only Cys17 is due to an interaction between the sulfate group of 17β-IES and the guanidino group of Arg14; this interaction would orient the reagent within the binding cleft. Based on the model, the charged sulfate group of 17β-IES is about 3.1 Å from the guanidino group of Arg14. In summary, 17β-IES functions as an affinity label of the nonsubstrate steroid site of rat liver glutathioneS-transferase, isozyme 1-1. Upon incubation with 17β-IES, the enzyme loses 40% of its activity, incorporates about 0.5 mol of reagent/enzyme subunit, and is modified only at Cys17. Protection against inactivation by 17β-IES is best provided by steroid sulfates, such as 17β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate, indicating that Cys17 is within the nonsubstrate steroid binding site of the enzyme and that its binding is more specific than that of 3β-IDA because of the interaction of the sulfate group with the side chain of Arg14. Based on analysis of molecular models, this nonsubstrate site is located within the cleft between the two subunits of the enzyme. We thank Dr. Yu-Chu Huang for obtaining the peptide sequences."

TdT is highly conserved in all vertebrate species, with a second isoform, characterized by a 20-amino acid insertion near the COOH-terminal end, described only in the mouse. The two murine isoforms differ in their subcellular localization, and the long isoform (TdTL) has previously been found to be unable to add N-regions. Using purified protein produced in a high level expression system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we were able to carry out detailed catalytic comparisons of these two TdT isoforms. We discovered that TdTL exhibits terminal transferase activity with kinetic parameters similar to those of the conserved TdT isoform (TdTS). We observed, however, that TdTL is inactivated at physiologic temperature but stable at lower temperatures. This thermal sensitivity of TdTL polymerase activity is not correlated with a significant change in the circular dichroism spectrum of the protein. Thus, the 20-amino acid insertion in TdTL does not affect the catalytic activity but modifies the thermosensitivity."

For example, the fact that the induction of most genes involved with indole acetic acid metabolism is insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX)1 suggests that newly synthesized protein is not necessary for activation of these genes (1Abel S. Nguyen M.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 533-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). CHX has also been reported to enhance and prolong the accumulation of mRNA of expressing genes in a process termed superinduction (2Koshiba T. Ballas N. Wong L.M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 396-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and to induce de novo transcription from nonexpressing genes as documented for PS-IAA4/5 (3Theologis A. Huynh T.V. Davis R.W. J.

Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Superinduction or de novo induction of genes by protein synthesis inhibitors is thought to occur through several distinct processes. CHX can enhance mRNA stability by preventing the synthesis of labile mRNA-degrading enzymes (9Pontecorvi A. Tata J.R. Phyillaier M. Robbins J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); alternatively, some protein synthesis inhibitors cause RNAs to be trapped on polysomes, thus shielding them from cytoplasmic ribonucleases (10Cochran B.H. Reffel A.C. Stiles C.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 939-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 11Edwards D.R. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2415-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For autorepressive genes, the inhibited translation of their protein product can lead to superinduction through an inability to shut off transcription (12Sassone-Corsi P. Sisson J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). CHX may lead to transcriptional activation via the loss of labile negative regulators. CHX can induce the uncoupling of DNA replication and chromatin assembly (because of the continued DNA replication and the absence of histone synthesis during CHX treatment), preventing the formation of a repressive chromatin structure (13Cesari M. Heliot L. Meplan C. Pabion M. Khochbin S. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); alternatively, CHX may induce uncoupling of DNA replication and gene specific repressors, thereby releasing chromatin constraint on transcription. CHX can lead to direct transcription activation by eliciting chromatin-associated signals such as H3 phosphorylation (14Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) or by biochemical modifications that lead to the activation of positive (or the deactivation of negative) transcription factors. Phaseolin, the major seed protein of bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, is encoded by a small gene family whose expression is tightly regulated both temporally and spatially (15Bustos M.M. Guiltinan M.J. Jordano J. Begum D. Kalkan F.A. Hall T.C. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 839-853PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the β-phaseolin gene (phas) is totally inactive during vegetative phases of plant development (16van der Geest A.H.M. Frisch D.A. Kemp J.D. Hall T.C. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is achieved by a repressive chromatin architecture (17Li G. Chandler S.P. Wolffe A.P. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that is remodeled concomitant with gene activation in the developing seed, resulting in disruption of histone-mediated DNA wrapping and permitting abundant factor binding to the phas promoter (18Li G. Hall T.C. Plant J. 1999; 19: 633-641Crossref Google Scholar). Activation of the phaspromoter is a two-step process: chromatin modification mediated by the transcription factor PvALF, followed by abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated transcriptional activation (19Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Toward evaluating the need for the synthesis of protein factors additional to PvALF to permit expression from the phaspromoter, leaves of line 58.1A plants (tobacco transformed with −1470phas/uidA, see Ref. 19Li G.

To our surprise, we found that three potent eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitors (CHX, verrucarin A, and emetine) were able to induce transcriptional expression from the phas promoter in these vegetative tissues without the presence of either PvALF or ABA. We demonstrated that phas activation can also be induced by the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and cantharidin. The stimulation of phas expression by protein synthesis inhibitors and by phosphatase inhibitors suggests that transcription from the phas promoter is regulated through a complex network of interactive signaling components and pathways. Seeds collected from either 58.1A plants or from line PvAlf-14 were surface-sterilized with 20% (v/v) household bleach and then rinsed three times in sterile water. Seedlings (10 days) or leaves from seedlings (30 days), selected on MS medium containing either 400 μg/ml kanamycin or 50 μg/ml hygromycin, were incubated in liquid basal MS medium with or without 100 μm ABA (± cis/trans isomer; Sigma) for 24 h (6 h for the RNase protection experiment) in the dark with gentle shaking at room temperature. Histochemical analysis of GUS activity was according to Jefferson et al.(20Jefferson R.A. Kavanaugh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (8264) Google Scholar). For fluorometric (MUG) assay, leaves or callus were homogenized in the GUS extraction buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Sarkosyl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. Then, 200 μl of extract were mixed with 200 μl of substrate solution (GUS extraction buffer + 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide: 4-MUG, Fluka) and incubated at 37 °C; 100-μl aliquots were removed at 0, 60, or 120 min and the reaction terminated by addition of 900 μl of Na2NO3. Fluorescence was measured on a fluorometer (VersaFluorTM fluorometer, Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations were determined using the colorimetric assay of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Specific GUS activity was calculated as pmol 4-MU h−1 μg−1protein. Antisense constructs for generating riboprobes were prepared by subcloning fragments containing the 3′ end of the uidA and the region encoding 18 S RNA into the vector pPCR-script amp sk(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Antisense uidA and 18 S rRNA riboprobes of 310 and 200 nucleotides, respectively, were synthesized by transcription in vitro, using T3 or T7 polymerase on aHindIII- or EcoRI-linearized plasmid. RPAs were performed in reactions containing 5–10 μg of total RNA using an RPAII kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The protected fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 murea gel. Approximately 5 g of leaf tissue was powdered in a mortar and pestle using liquid nitrogen, then treated with nuclei isolation buffer NIB1 (0.5 m hexylene glycol, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES pH 6.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% (v/v) aprotonin) in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 1400 × g for 10 min and washed twice in NIB2 (NIB1 without Triton X-100). All centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. Nuclei were resuspended in 3 ml RSB (22Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol.

The samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in TE buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% v/v aprotonin, 10 mm NaF). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (23Chadee D.N. Taylor W.R.

The anti-phosphorylated H3 (anti-pH3) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. The membrane containing the histones was immunochemically stained with anti-pH3 and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) using SuperSignal West Pico detection (Pierce). To examine whether de novo protein synthesis is required for PvALF-dependent induction of expression from thephas promoter in the presence of ABA, leaves from either 58.1A (tobacco transformed with −1470phas/uidA, see Ref.19Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or PvAlf-14 plants (line 58.1A additionally transformed withCaMV35S/PvAlf) were subjected to CHX treatment in the presence or absence of ABA. Half of the CHX-treated leaves was used for MUG assays, the other half was used for RPA experiments. MUG analysis showed that CHX was very effective in preventing de novoprotein synthesis, since no GUS accumulation was detected in PvAlf-14 seedling leaves treated with both ABA and CHX (Fig.1 A). Despite the complete inhibition of de novo protein synthesis, phasmRNA was still synthesized (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is not required for phas activation. The synthesis of uidA mRNA appeared to be slightly reduced in the presence of CHX. However, this difference may be due to the variation of PvALF levels among plants (19Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The similar levels of 18 S rRNA seen in each lane of the RPA assay show that comparable amounts of RNA were loaded. Although the above experiments show that the phas promoter can be activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, it is likely that this expression is not through ABA- or PvALF-mediated processes. As shown in Fig. 1 B, treatment of PvAlf-14 leaves with CHX in the absence of ABA or treatment of 58.1A plants with CHX in the presence or absence of ABA can also inducephas mRNA accumulation (Fig. 1 B, lanes2 and 4). This reveals that the CHX treatment can bypass the absolute requirement for PvALF and ABA to activatephas in transgenic tobacco (19Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The samples were cultured in CHX containing MS liquid medium for 6 h in these and subsequent CHX experiments reported in this paper because this period gave maximal accumulation of mRNA from 58.1A leaves (Fig.1 C). A similar induction of expression from the phas promoter by CHX to that seen in transgenic tobacco was obtained using leaf tissue of its native species, P. vulgaris (Fig. 1 D). This shows conclusively that the induction of expression seen in tobacco is not due to the use of a heterologous system. To investigate whetherphas activation by CHX results from the inhibition of protein synthesis, we tested phas induction under different concentrations of CHX. As shown in Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and3, the phas promoter is not activated at low concentrations (0.1 and 1 μm) of CHX that do not greatly reduce protein synthesis (Fig. 2 B). However, a low level of transcription (detected as uidA mRNA; Fig.2 A, lane 4) occurred after 5 h of 10 μm CHX treatment, when protein synthesis was reduced to 25% compared with the control. At 100 μm, CHX was 98% effective in inhibiting protein (GUS) synthesis (Fig. 2 B), and transcription from the phas promoter was strongly induced (Fig. 1 A). It has been hypothesized that treatment of cells with an efficient inhibitor of protein synthesis, such as CHX, would be expected to uncouple DNA synthesis and chromatin assembly and that this may have widespread consequences in relieving chromatin-mediated general transcriptional repression (13Cesari M. Heliot L. Meplan C. Pabion M. Khochbin S. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To determine whether uncoupling of DNA replication and chromatin assembly is responsible for protein inhibitor-inducible phas expression, we tested the effect of DNA replication inhibitors on CHX-induced phasexpression. As shown in Fig.3 A, pretreatment with 10 mm hydroxyurea (HU), a replication inhibitor that inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, for 30 min before adding CHX substantially reduced the degree of induction by CHX. Pretreatment of leaves with 10 mm HU for 24 h before adding CHX further reduced the degree of induction of uidA expression by CHX (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 5 compared withlanes 1 and 3). This reduction was not due to HU toxicity, since HU concentrations of up to 100 mm did not reduce transcription from the CaMV35S promoter (Fig.3 B). We also found that CHX-mediated activation ofphas is higher in young leaves where there is more DNA replication than that in older leaves (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 2 and 4). However, aphidicolin, another DNA replication inhibitor that inhibits DNA polymerase α, had only a small inhibitory effect on CHX-induced phas expression (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 7 and 8 withlane 1). Contrary to the histone depletion hypothesis, mimosine and genistein, compounds shown to inhibit DNA replication in animal (24Kalejta R.F. Hamlin J.L. Exp.

C, the influence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors on phas activation in 58.1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further evaluate the mechanism of CHX-induced phas activation, we examined the effect of alternative protein synthesis inhibitors (verrucarin A, emetine, anisomycin, and puromycin) on activation in leaf tissues of transgenic tobacco plants. Like CHX, verrucarin A and emetine strongly inducedphas expression (Fig. 4,A and B). However, puromycin and anisomycin did not induce phas activation when used at concentrations that are effective for inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of gene expression in animal cell lines (Fig. 4, B andC). Overexposure of the gel revealed uidAmRNA expression at levels barely above background for two different concentrations of puromycin and anisomycin (Fig. 4 C). The trace levels of uidA mRNA in the presence of 100 μg/ml puromycin and 10 μg/ml of anisomycin could be attributed to poor inhibition of protein synthesis at these concentrations, as indicated by MUG assays (Fig. 4 D). However, 10-fold higher concentrations of these inhibitors (1 mg/ml puromycin or 100 μg/ml anisomycin) are very effective in inhibiting protein synthesis (Fig.4 D), yet no uidA mRNA was detected in 58.1A leaves. This suggests that inhibition of protein synthesis alone will not lead to transcriptional activation from thephas promoter. In addition to inhibiting protein synthesis, CHX has been shown to induce histone H3 phosphorylation (14Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Because of the role of chromatin in silencing expression from thephas promoter, we decided to explore the use of okadaic acid, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor that has been shown to induce H3 phosphorylation and early-response gene expression in mammalian cells (14Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid was able to induce transcriptional expression from the phas promoter in leaf tissue of both 58.1A and PvAlf-14 plants (Fig.5 A, lanes 2 and4). The induction of phas expression from leaves of PvAlf-14 was about twice as strong as that from leaves of 58.1A. A similar serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, cantharidin, can also induce phas expression (data not shown). We then tested whether CHX- or okadaic acid-induced phasactivation is related to bulk H3 phosphorylation, as has been shown for early-response genes (14Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Western blotting with antibodies to pH3 showed that there is no discernible difference between the amount of pH3 in transgenic tobacco leaves in the presence or absence of CHX treatment (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 3 and4), suggesting that bulk H3 phosphorylation is not responsible for phas activation. Tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, phenylarsine oxide and sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor for dual specificity phosphatase and tyrosine phosphatase, were not effective in inducinguidA mRNA expression from the phas promoter. Slightly higher than background levels of uidA mRNA were detected only after overexposure of the gel for more than 2 days using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 5 C). Given the remarkable stimulation of expression from the phas promoter, we were interested in exploring the ability of CHX and okadaic acid to induce expression of other seed storage protein genes. As shown in Fig.6, RPA analysis clearly demonstrated that expression of uidA from the normally seed specificDC3 (26Seffens W.S. Almoguera C. Wilde H.D. Vonder Haar R.A. Thomas T.L. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), HaG3 (27Nunberg A.N. Li Z. Bogue M.A. Vivekananda J. Reddy A.S. Thomas T.L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 473-486PubMed Google Scholar), and Arcelin (28Anthony J.L. Vonder Haar R.A. Hall T.C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 839-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) promoters was induced in leaves of tobacco transformed with these constructs by treatment with CHX or okadaic acid, albeit at different efficiencies: DC3 was strongly induced but HaG3and Arcelin were induced only weakly. We have shown previously that the phas promoter adopts an inactive chromatin structure in leaf tissue of transgenic tobacco and that the repressive chromatin structure is disrupted upon transcriptional activation during embryogenesis, processes that require both PvALF and ABA (17Li G. Chandler S.P. Wolffe A.P. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Li G. Hall T.C. Plant J. 1999; 19: 633-641Crossref Google Scholar). The presence of PvALF results in remodeling of the chromatin architecture over the phaspromoter, allowing ABA-stimulated transcriptional activation (19Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we show that several eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitors can induce transcription from the phas promoter in tobacco and bean leaf tissue in the absence of either PvALF or ABA. The expression seen in leaves from bean, the plant from which phas was isolated (29Slightom J.L. Sun S.M. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1897-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), confirms that the induction observed in the case of tobacco does not result from the use of a heterologous system. We also demonstrated that CHX-induced phas activation is associated with inhibition of protein synthesis, although this is not the only requirement. Since phosphatase inhibitors can also inducephas activation, it is possible that protein synthesis inhibitor-induced expression from the phas promoter is mediated through a general signal transduction pathway involving phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. The stimulation of transcription from the Arcelin, Dc3, andHaG3 seed-specific promoters by CHX and okadaic acid (Fig.6) indicates the generality of transcriptional activation by these compounds. CHX-induced mRNA stability or CHX-inhibited autorepression can only contribute to superinduction of genes after their transcription has been activated. Sincephas is not expressed in leaf tissues of transgenic tobacco plants, as shown both by nuclei run-on and by RPA experiments (17Li G. Chandler S.P. Wolffe A.P. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), accumulation of its mRNA in the presence of CHX cannot result from mRNA stabilization or release from autorepression. Further support that mRNA stability is not involved is provided by the decreased level of uidA mRNA seen in leaves after 6 h of exposure to CHX (Fig. 1 C). Additional evidence against the involvement of mRNA stability is provided by the fact that verrucarin A also induces phas expression (Fig.4 A), even though its mode of action is to dissociate mRNAs from ribosomes, thereby exposing them to cytoplasmic ribonucleases. An attractive explanation for protein synthesis inhibitor-induciblephas expression is the uncoupling of DNA replication and chromatin assembly. In the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, the synthesis of both histones and/or non-nucleosomal repressors will be affected. If DNA replication occurs during CHX treatment, histone- or gene-specific repressors may not be present in sufficient quantity to cover the newly replicated phas promoter. In such cases,phas will be expressed, since the transcription complex is still functional (13Cesari M. Heliot L. Meplan C. Pabion M. Khochbin S. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This scenario suggests that CHX-induced transcription should be reduced upon addition of DNA replication inhibitors. Pretreatment of leaf tissue with the DNA replication inhibitor HU did indeed reduce induction by CHX and greater reduction was observed if more HU was added or if the pretreatment was longer (Fig. 3 A). This reduction is not due to HU toxicity, since higher levels of HU did not affect transcription from the constitutiveCaMV35S promoter (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, CHX-mediated induction was much greater for young leaves (in which replication is active) than for mature leaves (Fig. 3 C), where little replication occurs. A slight reduction in CHX-mediated activation was also observed in the presence of aphidicolin (Fig.3 A). In contrast to the above results, incubation of PvAlf-14 leaves with mimosine and genistein, two other inhibitors of replication, led to enhancement of CHX-mediated induction of expression from thephas promoter (Fig. 3 D). Although the different outcomes of experiments using replication inhibitors are puzzling, it is feasible that mimosine and genistein have other functions in addition to the inhibition of replication. It has been well documented that many protein synthesis inhibitors, such as CHX, superinduce mRNA synthesis by de novo transcriptional activation (2Koshiba T. Ballas N. Wong L.M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 396-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Greenberg M.E. Hermanowski A.L. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 31Messina J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11700-11705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lusska A. Wu L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15146-15151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wang P. Nuss D.L. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A widely accepted interpretation of this effect is that a labile transcription repressor is degraded following protein synthesis inhibition, resulting in transcriptional activation. The strong correlation seen here between protein synthesis inhibition andphas promoter activation supports this interpretation: cycloheximide (100 μm), verrucarin A, and emetine are effective protein synthesis inhibitors and all induce expression from the phas promoter. In contrast, puromycin (100 μg/ml) and anisomycin (10 μg/ml) are not effective inducers of phasactivation and are relatively weak inhibitors of protein synthesis in plants (puromycin at 100 μg/ml was only 45% effective in inhibiting GUS protein synthesis, and anisomycin at 10 μg/ml was 64% effective). However, at higher concentrations, puromycin (1 mg/ml) and anisomycin (100 μg/ml) are very effective in inhibiting protein synthesis (Fig. 4 D), but transcription was not activated in their presence (Fig. 4 C). While these results appear to detract from the possibility that a labile repressor is involved in regulating expression from the phas promoter, or that uncoupling of DNA replication and chromatin assembly is the cause ofphas induction, they may reflect the inhibition of specific components of the activation processes. For example, the individual protein synthesis inhibitors may be differentially effective with regard to specific components or those inhibitors that do induce expression may have side effects that lead to transcriptional activation. Another possible explanation for CHX-inducible expression from the phas promoter is that CHX can actively elicit chromatin-associated signals that lead to transcription activation. CHX has been shown to superinduce the c-jun gene in human cells (14Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), which was later shown to be correlated with bulk histone H3 phosphorylation (34Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In this case, activation of gene expression was not related to the inhibition of protein synthesis, and a subinhibitory concentration of protein synthesis inhibitor was able to superinduce c-jun transcription (35Edwards Y. Hopkinson D.A. Nature. 1980; 284: 511-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and cantharidin can inducephas activation (Fig. 5), immunoblotting of bulk histone with anti-pH3 antibodies showed that CHX treatment does not increase the level of bulk histone pH3 level. This suggests that CHX-inducedphas expression is not through global H3 phosphorylation, but certainly does not eliminate the possibility that localized H3 phosphorylation of phas chromatin is involved. It is likely that the inhibition of protein phosphatase by protein phosphatase inhibitors or of its synthesis by protein synthesis inhibitors has several biochemical consequences on signal transduction mechanisms. These could include phosphorylation or dephosphorylation events that lead to the activation of positive, or the deactivation of negative, transcription regulators (36Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Indeed, our experiments suggest that the inhibitors can act through a passive activation pathway (Fig. 7, stepsA or B) or an active pathway (Fig. 7, stepsC–F). We favor the active pathway as being the predominant explanation for our results, because the passive events require significant depletion of histones; this should be especially apparent for cells that are actively replicating. However, while our experiments with the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (Fig. 3 A) and to a lesser extent, aphidicolin, do show a decrease in protein synthesis inhibitor-induced activation, the effect is not striking and does not appear to be sufficient to account for the rapid induction of expression from the phas promoter upon exposure of leaves to protein synthesis inhibitors (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation of pre-existing substrates, appear to provide a feasible basis for the rapid induction of phas expression. In the putative active pathway, we postulate that a key protein phosphatase exists. The depletion of this phosphatase by protein synthesis inhibitors (Fig. 7, step F) and the inhibition of its activity by the inhibitors okadaic acid and cantharidin (Fig. 7, step C1) result in the induction of expression from thephas promoter. Either or both depletion and inhibition of the phosphatase (Fig. 7, steps C1–C3 or step F) could lead to the modification of the activity of transcription factors, directly or indirectly through the activation of additional phosphatase(s) or kinase(s). An alternative or additional set of events resulting from the depletion or inactivation of the postulated protein phosphatase could lead to chromatin potentiation as shown in Fig. 7, steps D and E. Potentiation can be achieved by targeted alterations in the chromatin environment encompassing specific genes, both directly, by phosphorylation of nucleosomal and chromatin proteins, or indirectly by allowing the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases to specific phosphoepitopes on transcription factors (Fig. 7, step E). Our experiments provide clues regarding the nature of the putative protein phosphatase. Because okadaic acid and cantharidin can inducephas expression while sodium orthovanadate cannot suggests that this protein phosphatase is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1, PP2A, or PP2B) that normally negatively regulates expression from the phas promoter. Interestingly, okadaic acid has been shown to inhibit most gibberellic acid-inducible events and partly inhibits the induction of a HVA gene by ABA (37Kuo A. Cappelluti S. Cervantes-Cervantes M. Rodriguez M. Bush D.S. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Kinase and phosphatase inhibitors have been shown to affect gene expression in response to ABA (38Knetsch M.L.W. Wang M. Snaar-Jagaska B.E. Heimovaara-Dijkstra S. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 39Sheen J. Science. 1996; 274: 1900-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 40Wu Y. Kuzma J. Marechal E. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Foster R. Chua N.H. Science. 1997; 278: 2126-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). For example, the DNA binding activity of the G-box-binding bZIP factor GBF1 can be stimulated through phosphorylation by a kinase from nuclear extracts (41Klimczak L.J. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and it is known that phosphorylation of bZIP factors in vivo initiates their translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (42Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Since CHX is a protein synthesis inhibitor, its inhibition of the putative phosphatase synthesis may mimic the loss of phosphatase activity and hence lead to a gain of function through the phosphorylation of kinases or transcription factors. The factor phosphorylated as a result of the presence of CHX should therefore be constitutively present in vegetative tissues, e.g. an EmBP-like bZIP factor or an helix-loop-helix factor such as PG1 (43Kawagoe Y. Murai N. Plant Sci. 1996; 116: 47-57Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phosphatase inhibition resulting from exposure to the protein inhibitors CHX, emetine, or verrucarin A could lead to both chromatin modification and transcriptional activation. Since we have shown that there is no bulk H3 phosphorylation as a result of CHX treatment, chromatin modification is unlikely to operate through direct H3 phosphorylation. However, it is possible CHX-triggered phosphorylation or dephosphorylation can activate a factor that can attract a nucleosome remodeling complex, or a histone acetyltransferase, or even a histone kinase that leads to local H3 phosphorylation. The same transcription factor or another factor activated by CHX must be a component of the ABA signal transduction pathway that leads to transcriptional activation of the phas gene (19Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The results obtained here are dramatic with regard to our understanding of the regulation of expression from the phas promoter. First, they show that the normally tight repression of expression from the phas promoter in vegetative tissue can be overcome rapidly by exposure to the potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, CHX. Second, while tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors had no discernible effect, inhibition of by okadaic acid activated transcription from thephas promoter, strongly implicating the presence of a serine/threonine phosphatase as a key regulator. Third, our findings extend previous studies that have demonstrated the ability of CHX to induce or superinduce transcription (2Koshiba T. Ballas N. Wong L.M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 396-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by showing that other protein synthesis inhibitors can act similarly. Fourth, the findings provide the insight that phosphorylation of a kinase or a transcription factor are likely components of the ABA-mediated activation pathway. Additional insight may be gained through future experiments to determine why the protein inhibitors anisomycin and puromycin do not effectively activate phas expression as do CHX, emetine, and verrucarin A. Similarly, the basis for the differential effects of the replication inhibitor HU compared with the inhibitors genistein and mimosine on CHX-mediated activation remains to be resolved. The differences may reflect specific modes of action of the inhibitors, or they may reflect differential interactions of the inhibitors or of downstream products resulting from inhibitor activity with components of the signal transduction and transcriptional activation systems that remain to be identified. We thank Mahesh Chandrasekharan for his detailed suggestions and Tom McKnight, Mike Manson, Dorothy Shippen, and Terry Thomas for valuable discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2324620113,"In the present studies, we have examined the effect of Sp1 on the activation of the human DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol), a TATA-less promoter. A HeLa cell nuclear extract (NE) based in vitro runoff transcription system of core beta-pol promoter human DNA (pbetaP8) three-step kinetic model of transcription initiation were used to describe the kinetic effect of Sp1. The results showed that distal Sp1-binding sites in the core beta-pol promoter are important for transcriptional activation of the pbetaP8 promoter. A detailed kinetic analysis showed that Sp1 stimulates the activity of the pbetaP8 promoter through distal Sp1-binding sites by increasing the amount of recruitment, instead of stimulating the apparent rate of RPc assembly (k1). There was no significant effect of Sp1 on the apparent rate of open complex (RPo) formation (k2) or on the apparent rate of promoter clearance (k3) of the pbetaP8 promoter. These studies define the kinetic mechanisms by which Sp1 may regulate the rate of transcript formation of the pbetaP8 promoter, and these results may have implications for Sp1 regulation of TATA-less promoters."

Although PBGS proteins from different organisms differ in their use of metal ions, there is remarkable sequence conservation between the PBGS from eubacteria, archaea, and eucaryotes implying a commonality in the overall protein architecture and reaction mechanism (1Jaffe E.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

The overall protein sequence identity between E. coli and human PBGS is 42%, and the active site residues are significantly more conserved. Considerable effort has been applied to the characterization of PBGS proteins from various organisms, and several crystal structures are now available (6Erskine P.T. Senior N. Awan S. Lambert R.

Only one intermediate, an enzyme-substrate Schiff base, has been identified (11Nandi D.L. Shemin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 31: 1236-1242Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Several x-ray crystal structures contain levulinic acid bound in a fashion analogous to the Schiff base (Protein Database codes 1B4K, 1YLV, and 1B4E), and the actual Schiff base involving ALA has been observed by 13C and15N NMR for a chemically modified form of bovine PBGS (12Jaffe E.K. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4258-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,13Jaffe E.K. Markham G.D. Rajagopalan J.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8345-8350Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This work describes the catalytic and physical properties of PBGS variants with mutations to the Schiff base forming lysine, which for E. coli and human PBGS are Lys-246 and Lys-252, respectively. An appealing aspect of these variants is their expected inability to catalyze porphobilinogen formation and thus there exists the potential of observing new enzyme-bound reaction intermediates using 13C NMR. Although the proteins were found not to be sufficiently inactive for that purpose, the 13C NMR spectra of E. coli Lys-246 mutants with 13C-labeled product bound at the active site are presented. The number of functional active sites reported for the PBGS homo-octamer varies between four and eight, and it remains unclear if there is a unifying thread that will resolve this apparent discrepancy. For instance, data on E. coli PBGS have been interpreted to support both four and eight active sites/octamer (3Spencer P. Jordan P.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Spencer P. Jordan P.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Mitchell L.W. Volin M. Jaffe E.K.

ALA-HCl, KPi, Bis-tris propane, and p-(dimethylamino)-benzaldehyde were from Sigma. 2-Mercaptoethanol (βME) was from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY) and distilled under vacuum prior to use. HgCl2, ZnCl2, MgCl2 (ultrapure), and high purity KOH were from Aldrich. [4-13C]ALA was custom-synthesized by C/D/N Isotopes (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada).

DNA plasmid purification kits were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized in-house by the Fannie Ripple Biotechnology Center. All other chemicals were reagent grade. PBGS activity assays were as described previously for E. coli (2Mitchell L.W. Jaffe E.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and human PBGS (4Jaffe E.K. Volin M. Bronson-Mullins C.R. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Kervinen J. Martins J. Quinlan Jr., J.F.

The standard assay buffer contained 0.1m KPi, pH 7.0, 10 mm βME, 10 μm Zn(II), and ∼5–15 μg ml−1 PBGS. E. coli PBGS assays also contained 1 mm Mg(II). The standard assay is started by the addition of ALA-HCl to a final concentration of 10 mm, which lowers the pH to 6.8. After 5 min the reaction is quenched, and porphobilinogen is determined using Ehrlich's reagent. Up to 1 mg ml−1 of purified PBGS and a 15-min incubation were used for mutant proteins. The plasmid pCR261, containing the E. coli hemBgene for PBGS, was a kind gift of Dr. C. Roessner of Texas A & M, College Station, TX (21Roessner C.A. Spencer J.B. Ozaki S. Min C. Atshaves B.P.

A 1400-base pair fragment containing the 1100-base pair hemB gene was excised from the EcoRI and BamHI site of pCR261 and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pUC119 to form pLM1228. The Muta-Gene kit from Bio-Rad was used for site-directed mutagenesis on hemBas described previously (15Mitchell L.W. Volin M. Jaffe E.K. J. Biol.

The plasmids, pK246N, pK246G, pK246W, pK246H, and pK246M, were transformed into the E. coli strain HB101; the plasmid sequences were confirmed throughout the entire hemB gene by the FCCC DNA Sequencing Facility such that two independent complementary data sets were obtained for all coding sequences. All plasmid preparations used for sequencing were derived directly from bacterial growths used for protein preparations. All plasmids contained the expected mutation and no second site mutations. The sequence agreed with the hemBgene sequence derived from the 6′-8′ region of the E. coligenome (GenBankTM accession number U73857). There are significant differences between these and earlier published hemB gene sequences (22Echelard Y. Dymetryszyn J. Drolet M. Sasarman A. Mol. Gen.

In an unsuccessful attempt to obtain inactive protein not contaminated with chromosomally encoded wild-type E. coli PBGS, the plasmids pK246N, pK246G, pK246H, pK246M, and pK246W were each transformed into the hemB − strains RP523 or HU1000 in the presence of hemin. HU1000 (hemB, thr1, leuB6, thi1, lacY1, tonA21, suppE44, λ−, F−) and its parent strain RP523, the kind gifts of Drs. C. Russell and S. Cosloy of City College of New York, do not express a functional PBGS, require hemin, and are hemin-permeable (which most E. coli are not) (24Umanoff H. Russell C.S. Cosloy S.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4969-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation was determined as described previously (15Mitchell L.W. Volin M. Jaffe E.K. J. Biol.

The transformants proved unstable, and it was not possible to obtain expression of inactive recombinant PBGS from these constructs, even when the bacteria were grown fermentatively to minimize the metabolic requirement for tetrapyrroles. Human PBGS was expressed as described previously (4Jaffe E.K. Volin M. Bronson-Mullins C.R. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Kervinen J. Martins J. Quinlan Jr., J.F. Sazinsky M.H. Steinhouse E.M. Yeung A.T. J.

This human PBGS corresponds to the most abundant of two common alleles and contains a lysine at position 59 (K59). Purification of wild-type E. coli PBGS was as described previously (2Mitchell L.W. Jaffe E.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Jaffe E.K. Ali S. Mitchell L.W. Taylor K.M. Volin M. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All purification buffers contained 10 μm Zn(II) and 1 mm Mg(II). Yields were ∼15 mg of protein/g of cells. All five mutant proteins were purified from transformants of strain HB101. In these cases, the crude extract was subject to a 45% ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the pellet was redissolved and run through a Sephacryl S-300 column; the major protein peak at 41–46% column volume was then purified on a DE-Biogel A column, and resultant protein was concentrated and stored at −70 °C. Some NMR studies of protein samples to which substrate was added revealed the time-dependent loss of porphobilinogen and formation of an alternative pyrrole thus indicating a contaminant protein that metabolized porphobilinogen. This contaminant could be removed by a second passage through the S-300 column. Based on an assay of background levels of PBGS expressed by HB101, mutant protein preparations from constructs in HB101 are contaminated with endogenous wild-type PBGS encoded by the hemB gene of E. coli strain HB101 at a level of 0.02–0.1%. Human PBGS corresponding to the K59 allele and the K252G variant were purified as described previously where the DEAE column provided a separation of the Mg(II)-responsive and chromosomally encoded E. coli PBGS from Mg(II)-insensitive human PBGS (4Jaffe E.K. Volin M. Bronson-Mullins C.R. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Kervinen J. Martins J. Quinlan Jr., J.F. Sazinsky M.H. Steinhouse E.M. Yeung A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2619-2626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). E. coli PBGS (wild-type and Lys-246 variants) at 2 mg ml−1 were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 0.1 m KPi, pH 7, 10 mm βME, 10 μm Zn(II), and 1 mmMg(II) (Buffer I). The proteins were then placed on ice for ∼5 min followed by the addition of 1.9 mg of NaBH4 and 1 min later by the addition of [4-14C]ALA (9 × 104cpm/μmol) to a final concentration of 10 mm ALA-HCl. Controls were included in which water replaced NaBH4 and 0.1 n HCl replaced the stock 0.1 m ALA-HCl. After 10 min, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 3 volumes of ice-cold, saturated (NH4)2SO4and allowed to sit for 30 min. The precipitated protein was centrifuged, and the protein pellets were redissolved in ∼1 ml of Buffer I. The protein samples were then dialyzed overnight versus 4 liters of Buffer I prior to radioactivity, protein concentration, and catalytic activity determinations. Schiff base trapping studies on human PBGS used unlabeled ALA and followed the same protocol with the exception that Mg(II) was omitted from Buffer I. E. coli PBGS and all the Lys-246 variants (∼200 μg) were digested overnight using 2 μg of AspN protease after cysteine residues were modified by iodoacetamide. The resultant peptides were mapped by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (20Jaffe E.K. Abrams W.R. Kaempfen H.X. Harris Jr., K.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2113-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Peaks were collected manually. “Matching” peaks were identified by inspection of the peptide map. All matching peaks as well as major “additional peaks” were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis using a Perseptive Voyager DE instrument. The program PAWS (R. C. Beavis, New York University) was used to help identify the various peptides. For identification of the Schiff base containing peptide, high specific radioactivity [3H]ALA and NaBH4 were used as above to label the reactive lysine; then the Schiff base-modified peptide was identified following AspN protease digestion. The amino acid sequence of the radiolabeled peptides was obtained using Edman degradation techniques by W. R. Abrams in the Protein Analytical Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine. Atomic absorption analysis of E. coli PBGS for Zn(II) and Mg(II) were done on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 100 spectrometer using an air/acetylene flame. Slide-A-Lysers containing each PBGS variant, ∼0.2 ml at 25–35 mg ml−1, were dialyzed together against 2 liters of 0.1 m Bis-tris propane, pH 8, containing 10 mm βME, 1 mmMg(II), and either 10 μm or 30 μm Zn(II). The dialysate was analyzed for Zn(II) directly without dilution. The dialysate was diluted 50-fold prior to analysis for Mg(II) to be within the linear range of the instrument. The protein samples were each diluted ∼50-fold prior to analysis for Zn(II), Mg(II), and protein. E. coli PBGS samples, at concentrations of both 7 mg ml−1 (0.2 mm subunits) and 25–35 mg ml−1(∼1 mm subunits) in ∼250-μl volumes, were placed in Slide-A-Lysers (0.5 ml maximum volume) and equilibrated by dialysis at room temperature against 40 ml of 0.1 m Bis-tris propane, pH 8, 10 mm βME, 10 μm Zn(II), 1 mm Mg(II), and various concentrations of porphobilinogen ranging from 5 μm to 1.4 mm. The concentration of porphobilinogen inside and outside the Slide-A-Lyser was determined using Ehrlich's reagent. Protein concentrations were determined by quantitative total amino acid analyses using vapor phase hydrolysis in 6 n HCl, 0.1% phenol, at 110 °C for 22 h followed by phenylisothiocyanate pre-column derivatization and high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. Spectral parameters were as described previously (12Jaffe E.K. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4258-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The E. coli protein samples uniformly contained 100–150 mg of PBGS in 1.8 ml (∼1 mm active sites) of buffer containing 20% D2O. The buffers were 0.1m KPi or Bis-tris propane-HCl, 10 mm βME, 1 mm Mg(II), 10 μmZn(II) at pH 6, 7, or 8. In all cases, natural abundance13C NMR spectra of the proteins were obtained (12,000–36,000 scans) prior to the addition of [4-13C]ALA. Following addition of [4-13C]ALA, all samples catalyzed the stoichiometric conversion to [3,5-13C]porphobilinogen. Dialysis at pH 6 was used to remove enzyme-bound product after the enzyme-product spectra were obtained. The chemical shifts of [3,5-13C]porphobilinogen (both free and bound) are insensitive to these changes in buffer or pH. However, the Kd for the enzyme-product complex is highly pH-dependent (15Mitchell L.W. Volin M. Jaffe E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24054-24059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Spectra obtained after dialysis at pH 6 confirmed the dissociation of enzyme-bound product. The E. coli PBGS proteins K246M, K246W, K246H, K246G, and K246N as purified from the E. coli host strain HB101 have specific activities ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 μmol h−1mg−1, compared with the wild-type enzyme value of ∼50 μmol h−1mg−1 (Table I). Thus, these mutants are remarkably impaired in their catalytic potency. Some proportion of the activities observed in these mutants was determined to be due to variable levels of the chromosomally encoded wild-type PBGS because this activity can be reduced significantly by treatment with ALA and NaBH4 (see below). The mutant protein K246G was designed to contain a “hole” at the active site into which the lysine side chain surrogate ethylamine might bind and restore activity. Addition of 50 mm ethylamine had no effect on the specific activity of the K246G preparation or wild-type PBGS and did not alter the chemical shifts of [3,5-13C]porphobilinogen bound to K246G (see below). The purification properties of all the mutant proteins did not differ appreciably from wild-type E. coli PBGS protein. All were stable, highly soluble, octameric proteins. Attempts to obtain expression of inactive Lys-246 mutants in the hemB − hosts, RP523 and HU1000, either failed or resulted in recombination events that regenerated wild-type protein. Human PBGS and the K252G mutant were purified from a BLR(DE3) host E. coli strain (4Jaffe E.K. Volin M. Bronson-Mullins C.R. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Kervinen J. Martins J. Quinlan Jr., J.F. Sazinsky M.H.

Fig. 2shows that the chromosomally encoded E. coli PBGS activity separates from the relatively inactive human PBGS K252G variant during the DEAE chromatography step used during purification. Whether the residual activity is due to E. coli PBGS can be shown by its ability to be activated by Mg(II). The low activity of the final purified K252G from the S-300 column showed no activation upon addition of Mg(II). The purified human PBGS K252G variant showed a Km of 5.6 mm and a Vmax of 0.026 μmol h−1 mg−1 relative to the wild-type values for K59 of 0.1 mm and 44 μmol h−1 mg−1 for Km and Vmax, respectively, giving a 105-fold reduction in V/K. In this case, the low level of activity was not sensitive to inactivation through treatment with ALA and NaBH4 (see below). Thus, we can exclude the possibility that the activity is due to either 1) translational error or 2) incorporation of E. coli PBGS monomers into the homo-octameric human PBGS. Human PBGS K252G activity is also sensitive to inhibition by Pb(II) which indicates that the alternative Lys-252 Schiff base independent mechanism depends on the catalytic Zn(II) (25Jaffe E.K.

The binding of Zn(II) and Mg(II) to E. coliPBGS is cooperative (5Jaffe E.K. Ali S. Mitchell L.W. Taylor K.M. Volin M. Markham G.D.

To address the role of Lys-246 in this cation binding process, we analyzed the ability of the Lys-246 variants to bind Zn(II) and Mg(II). For all five mutants, atomic absorption analysis showed binding of Zn(II) and Mg(II) at the same stoichiometry and affinity as wild-type PBGS (see Table I). Thus, Lys-246 is not functional in the cooperativity of Zn(II) and Mg(II) binding. Because the mutants are not defective in metal binding, this supports an alternative E. coli PBGS reaction mechanism involving the catalytic Zn(II) but lacking the Schiff base to Lys-246. All the E. coliproteins in this study were subjected to Schiff base trapping using radiolabeled ALA and NaBH4. Controls were carried out in the absence of ALA or NaBH4 and both reagents. The results are presented in Table II. For wild-type E. coli PBGS, the control samples, which included all the physical manipulations to the protein, retained complete catalytic activity. In contrast, when treated with both [4-14C]ALA and NaBH4, three samples of wild-type PBGS each showed ∼80% inactivation and 14C labeling at 0.42–0.49 ALA/subunit. This stoichiometry is consistent with four functional active sites per octamer. The mutants K246N, K246G, K246H, K246M, and K246W were not significantly radiolabeled under these conditions; however, in mutants for which activity was above detection levels, the trace activities were significantly reduced, indicating that the activity of these preparations derives from contamination by chromosomally encoded wild-type E. coli PBGS.Table IIALA-dependent NaBH 4 inactivation and [4- 14 C]ALA labeling of PBGSEnzymePercent remaining activity without NaBH4Percent remaining activity with NaBH42-aControls with NaBH4without substrate all gave greater than 95% recovery of activity.14C per octamer with NaBH42-bControls using [4-14C]ALA without NaBH4 all labeled at less than 0.05 per octamer.Wild type E. coli9414–193.36, 3.44, 3.922-cThree separate determinations.K246N92190.08K246G100≤472-dAssay results at detection limit.0.08K246WND2-eND, not determined.ND0.24K246MNDND0.16K246HNDND0.24Wild-type human (K59)9935NDK252G8585ND2-a Controls with NaBH4without substrate all gave greater than 95% recovery of activity.2-b Controls using [4-14C]ALA without NaBH4 all labeled at less than 0.05 per octamer.2-c Three separate determinations.2-d Assay results at detection limit.2-e ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Human PBGS K59 and K252G were subjected to Schiff base trapping studies using unlabeled ALA. In this case, 83% inactivation was observed for K59, and no inactivation was observed for the K252G variant, which indicates that the activity observed for the latter does not depend upon Schiff base formation between ALA and the protein. Prior studies on mammalian PBGS uniformly show >85% inactivation at stoichiometries approaching 0.5 NaBH4 trapped [14C]ALA per subunit (11Nandi D.L. Shemin D. J. Biol.

AspN protease digestion followed by peptide mapping was carried out for all the E. coli proteins under study. In cases without radioactivity, the identity and sequence of the peptides were deduced from the masses determined by MALDI-TOF analysis. Some peptides were found to result from N-terminal cleavage at glutamic acid. The Lys-246 containing peptide (retention time, ∼52 min, see “Experimental Procedures”) was confirmed by sequencing. In the case of K246M and K246W, the retention time of this peak moved in a predictable fashion as calculated by the program PEPTIDESORT of the GCG package (+10.3 min and + ∼20 min, respectively). For K246G, K246H, and K246N, the match between the predicted and observed variation in retention time was less precise. The observed changes were +9.4 min, −0.4 min, and −4.9 min (predicted times were +2.7, +4.0, and 1.6 min, respectively). As illustrated in Table I, the peptide masses confirmed the identity of the mutation. For wild-type E. coli PBGS treated with tritiated ALA and NaBH4, the radioactivity was found in a cluster of peptide peaks in"
https://openalex.org/W1969666533,"The human adenovirus type 2 E2 early (E2E) transcriptional control region contains an efficient RNA polymerase III promoter, in addition to the well characterized promoter for RNA polymerase II. To determine whether this promoter includes intragenic sequences, we examined the effects of precise substitutions introduced between positions +2 and +62 on E2E transcription in an RNA polymerase III-specific, in vitro system. Two noncontiguous sequences within this region were necessary for efficient or accurate transcription by this enzyme. The sequence and properties of the functional element proximal to the sites of initiation identified it as an A box. Although a B box sequence could not be unambiguously located, substitutions between positions +42 and +62 that severely impaired transcription also inhibited binding of the human general initiation protein TFIIIC. Thus, this region of the RNA polymerase III E2E promoter contains a B box sequence. We also identified previously unrecognized intragenic sequences of the E2E RNA polymerase II promoter. In conjunction with our previous observations, these data establish that RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III promoter sequences are superimposed from approximately positions -30 to +20 of the complex E2E transcriptional control region. The alterations in transcription induced by certain mutations suggest that components of the RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III transcriptional machines compete for access to overlapping binding sites in the E2E template."
