https://openalex.org/W2054260525,"Studies with peptide-based and macromolecular inhibitors of the caspase family of cysteine proteases have helped to define a central role for these enzymes in inflammation and mammalian apoptosis. A clear interpretation of these studies has been compromised by an incomplete understanding of the selectivity of these molecules. Here we describe the selectivity of several peptide-based inhibitors and the coxpox serpin CrmA against 10 human caspases. The peptide aldehydes that were examined (Ac-WEHD-CHO, Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-YVAD-CHO,t-butoxycarbonyl-IETD-CHO, and t-butoxycarbonyl-AEVD-CHO) included several that contain the optimal tetrapeptide recognition motif for various caspases. These aldehydes display a wide range of selectivities and potencies against these enzymes, with dissociation constants ranging from 75 pm to >10 μm. The halomethyl ketone benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD fluoromethyl ketone is a broad specificity irreversible caspase inhibitor, with second-order inactivation rates that range from 2.9 × 102m−1 s−1 for caspase-2 to 2.8 × 105m−1 s−1 for caspase-1. The results obtained with peptide-based inhibitors are in accord with those predicted from the substrate specificity studies described earlier. The cowpox serpin CrmA is a potent (K i < 20 nm) and selective inhibitor of Group I caspases (caspase-1, -4, and -5) and most Group III caspases (caspase-8, -9, and -10), suggesting that this virus facilitates infection through inhibition of both apoptosis and the host inflammatory response.

Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases, which at present includes 11 homologues of human origin, are important mediators of both inflammation, where they are involved in the production of several inflammatory cytokines, and apoptosis, where they participate in signaling and effector pathways (for review, see Ref. 1Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). The evidence for the central role of these enzymes in both of these biological processes was initially obtained using potent peptide-based and macromolecular inhibitors. For example, the finding that Ac-YVAD-CHO, a potent inhibitor of caspase-1, prevented the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β)1 from monocytes, suggested that this enzyme was, in fact, the pro-IL-1β-processing enzyme (2Thornberry N.A.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). This was later confirmed with the description of caspase-1-deficient mice, which are defective in the production of this cytokine (3Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku F. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 4Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Towne E. Tracey D. Wardwell S. Wei F.-Y. Wong W. Kamen R. Seshadri T. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Similarly, the observation that apoptosis could be attenuated by the cowpox serpin CrmA, also known to be a potent caspase-1 inhibitor, provided the first compelling evidence that caspases play an important role in mammalian cell death (5Gagliardini V. Fernandez P.-A. Lee R.K.K. Drexler H.C.A. Rotello R.J. Fishman M.C. Yuan J. Science. 1994; 263: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). This has recently been confirmed by several studies, including the description of caspase-3-deficient mice, which have a striking defect in the programmed cell deaths that occur during neuronal development (6Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Studies using these and other caspase inhibitors continue to be an important component of the repertoire of scientists investigating these complex biological processes in whole cells and in vivo. Regarding the latter, there are numerous recent reports that some caspase inhibitors are efficacious in several different animal disease models. For example, both reversible and irreversible peptide-based inhibitors have been reported to be effective in animal models of stroke, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, liver disease, and traumatic brain injury (7Yakovlev A.

Unfortunately, little information has been available on the selectivity of these inhibitors for caspase family members. The most distinguishing catalytic features of caspases are their stringent specificity for Asp in the S1 subsite and a requirement for at least four amino acids to the left of the cleavage site (2Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional crystal structures of caspase-1 and caspase-3 suggest that these enzymes employ a typical cysteine protease mechanism, involving a catalytic diad of Cys and His (13Wilson K.P.

Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This information has led to the identification of several classes of peptide-based inhibitors using strategies that have proven successful for inhibition of other cysteine proteases (for review, see Ref. 16Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Nicholson D.W. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1995; 2: 389-399Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Examples of reversible inhibitors include aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones. Among the irreversible caspase inhibitors that have been described are diazomethyl ketones, acyloxymethyl ketones, and halomethyl ketones. The most potent of these compounds contains a tetrapeptide recognition motif that is optimal for the enzyme of interest. In this regard, we have recently described a combinatorial approach that has been used to determine the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 10 human caspases (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The results indicate that, although all of these enzymes have a common stringent requirement for Asp in the P1 position, their extended specificities are distinct. Specifically, the results divide these enzymes into three major groups and identify P4 as the single most important determinant of specificity among caspases. Group I enzymes (caspase-1, -4, and -5) prefer the sequence WEHD, but are rather promiscuous compared with other caspases. The optimal tetrapeptide recognition motif for Group II enzymes (caspase-2, -3, and -7) is DEXD, and these enzymes are highly selective, with a near absolute specificity for Asp in P4. Group III caspases (caspase-6, -8, -9, and -10) prefer the sequence (LV)EXD. These results, together with those from several independent studies, suggest that Group I caspases function primarily as inflammatory mediators, whereas Group II and Group III caspases play important roles in the effector (Group II) and signaling (Group III) events during apoptosis. An intimate understanding of the individual substrate specificities of the caspases permits the design of potent peptide-based inhibitors. In this study, we have investigated the potency and selectivity of several peptide aldehyde inhibitors, the fluoromethyl ketone Z-VAD-FMK and the cowpox serpin CrmA. The results are in accord with predictions from the earlier substrate specificity results and facilitate the interpretations of previous studies that have employed some of these compounds in whole cells and in vivo models of disease. Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO were purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Ac-WEHD-CHO was prepared as described (18Rano T.A. Timkey T. Peterson E.P. Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Becker J.W. Chapman K.T. Thornberry N.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 149-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The tetrapeptide aldehydes were reconstituted in Me2SO as 10 mm stock solutions; subsequent dilutions were made in distilled water and kept at −20 °C. The P1 Asp methyl ester of Z-VAD-FMK (methyl ester) was a generous gift from Enzyme Systems (Dublin, CA). To generate the free acid, this compound was incubated in a 50% methanol and 10% triethylamine aqueous solution at room temperature for 5 min. Under these conditions, the half-life of the free acid is ∼50 min. Ac-YVAD-AMC, Ac-DEVD-AMC, and Ac-YVAD-CHO were obtained from the Peptide Institute. Ac-WEHD-AMC and Ac-VEHD-AMC were prepared as described previously (18Rano T.A. Timkey T. Peterson E.P. Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Becker J.W. Chapman K.T. Thornberry N.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 149-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Commercially available N-Boc-O-benzylthreonine was first treated with mesyl chloride and allyl alcohol in the presence of pyridine to afford the corresponding allyl ester in 50% yield. Treatment of this intermediate with trifluoroacetic acid followed by coupling with N-Boc-glutamic acid benzyl ester using hydroxybenzotriazole and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride provided the protected dipeptide in 90% yield. TheN-Boc deprotection-coupling sequence was repeated usingN-Boc-isoleucine, and N-Boc-IET allyl ester was obtained in 76% yield. The allyl group was then removed by treatment with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium and pyrrolidine to provideN-Boc-IET-COOH in 88% yield.N-Allyloxycarbonylaspartic acid benzyl acetal was prepared from allyloxycarbonylaspartic acid tert-butyl ester in 34% overall yield using the following sequence. First, the carboxylic acid was activated with isobutyl chloroformate and N-methylmorpholine and selectively reduced by sodium borohydride. Then, oxidation was carried out using oxalyl chloride and Me2SO, followed by treatment of the resulting aldehyde with benzyl alcohol and tosic acid. The tripeptideN-Boc-IET-COOH was then coupled withN-allyloxycarbonylaspartic acid benzyl acetal in the presence of bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium chloride, tributyltin hydride, hydroxybenzotriazole, and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, and the title product N-Boc-IETD-CHO was obtained in 64% overall yield by treatment with hydrogen and 10% palladium hydroxide on carbon. The same synthetic sequence applies to the synthesis of Boc-AEVD-CHO. In this case, alanine was used instead of isoleucine, and valine instead of threonine. An Escherichia coli expression vector containing CrmA, which contains an N-terminal His tag, was obtained from Long Quan and Guy Salvesen (Burnham Institute). Cells from an overnight culture were diluted 15-fold and grown in LB medium at 37 °C toA 600 = 0.7. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 × g, resuspended in fresh LB medium (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A1Google Scholar), and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA. Pellets were resuspended in 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl using a Dounce homogenizer and lysed using a French press. The soluble proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then loaded on a freshly prepared Talon column (2.5 × 8 cm, CLONTECH), and the column was washed using the resuspension buffer. The protein was eluted using 100 mm imidazole. Fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmDTT, and 300 mm NaCl. This protein was maintained at 4 °C without loss of activity for at least 1 year. The method used for production of caspase-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, -8, and -9 involves folding of active enzymes from their constituent large and small subunits, which are expressed separately in E. coli. Subunits were engineered for expression as described previously (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). 2The small subunit of caspase-8 was engineered for expression as the Met-Ser375–Asp479 small subunit. During folding and purification, this subunit was autoproteolytically cleaved at Asp384-Leu385 to generate a subunit with a molecular mass of 10,880.4 Da. The selections of subunit boundaries were based on a comparison of the proenzyme sequences with the sequences of those caspase subunits that have been purified from natural sources (caspase-1 and caspase-3). Consequently, it is possible that, in some cases, the enzyme produced using this method is not identical to that which exists in nature. Exponentially growing E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells carrying the respective expression plasmid were cultured in M9 medium at 37 °C with overnight induction using 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for expression of the recombinant proteins. Under these conditions, the subunit protein was localized in the inclusion body fraction, where it generally constituted >90% of the total protein. To obtain active enzyme, the individual subunits from purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl and then rapidly diluted to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml at room temperature under conditions determined to be optimal for each enzyme. Caspase-1, -4, and -5 were folded in 100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.25–1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm DTT, pH 7.5, in the presence of the peptide aldehyde inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO (10 μm). Caspase-2 was folded in 100 mm HEPES, 20% sucrose, and 10 mm DTT, pH 7.5. Caspase-3 was folded in 100 mmTris, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm DTT, pH 8.0. Caspase-7, -8, and -9 were folded in 100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mmDTT, pH 7.5. Folding was achieved by overnight incubation at room temperature. Following folding, active enzyme was separated from inactive subunit protein by ion-exchange chromatography. With the exception of caspase-5, which was purified by cation-exchange chromatography using a 1-ml Hi-Trap SP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the enzymes were purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a 1-ml Hi-Trap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Caspase-1 was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography as reported previously (18Rano T.A. Timkey T. Peterson E.P. Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Becker J.W. Chapman K.T. Thornberry N.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 149-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Active recombinant caspase-6 and caspase-10 were instead prepared by expressing a construct encoding the entire proenzyme, minus the N-terminal peptide, in E. coli under conditions where a portion of the protein produced is cytosolic and undergoes self-maturation. Caspase-6 was engineered as a Met-Ser-Phe25–Asn293 N-terminal domainless construct, and caspase-10 as a Met-Leu-Lys221–Ile479 N-terminal domainless construct. Exponentially growing E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells carrying the respective expression plasmid were cultured in LB medium at 25 °C with a 3-h incubation using 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for expression of the recombinant proteins. The E. coli cells were harvested; washed in phosphate-buffered saline; and broken by a French press in 25 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 4 mmDTT, pH 7.5, in the presence of protease inhibitors (Sigma P2714), taking care to keep the solutions on ice. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The enzyme in the resulting supernatant was subsequently partially purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Hi-Trap Q columns). The activity of each enzyme was measured using continuous fluorometric assays analogous to those previously described for caspase-1 and caspase-3 (2Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R.

In each case, a substrate with the general structure Ac-XEXD-AMC was employed, incorporating a peptide that is identical or similar to the optimal tetrapeptide recognition motif for each enzyme (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Briefly, appropriate dilutions of enzyme were added to reaction mixtures containing substrate (at a concentration ≤ K m) and various concentrations of the inhibitor of interest in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. Liberation of AMC was monitored continuously at room temperature using a Tecan Fluostar 96-well plate reader (black plates from Dynatech Laboratories Inc.) using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were carried out at room temperature under standard reaction conditions defined as 0.1 m HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm DTT, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. All kinetic constants were computed by direct fits of the data to the appropriate equation using a nonlinear least-squares analysis computer program (NLIN) developed in this laboratory. For the reversible inhibitors (peptide aldehydes and CrmA), in cases where no time-dependent inhibition was observed, reaction rates were fit by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition to obtain a value for the dissociation constant K i. In cases where inhibition was time-dependent, K i was instead calculated from the steady-state velocities or from the rate constants for association (k on) and dissociation (k off) of enzyme-inhibitor complexes according to the equations developed by Morrison and Walsh (21Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar) for analysis of slow and tight-binding inhibitors. The second-order inactivation rates (k) for the irreversible caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was measured as described previously (22Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Zhao J.J. Howard A.D. Griffin P.R. Chapman K.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The errors in reproducing the rate and dissociation constants were never >10%. The selection of tetrapeptide aldehydes for this study was based on an understanding of the known substrate specificity of these enzymes (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The aldehydes Ac-WEHD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO contain the optimal tetrapeptide recognition motif for Group I and II caspases, respectively. The peptide in Boc-IETD-CHO resembles the preferred sequences for Group III caspases. This is also the sequence found at the site of cleavage of the caspase-3 proenzyme, a likely endogenous substrate for these enzymes. Ac-YVAD-CHO was selected because it was formerly the most potent reversible caspase inhibitor known and, as a consequence, has been used extensively as a biological tool. Finally, Boc-AEVD-CHO was included as it was anticipated to be a broad specificity caspase inhibitor, based again on the known amino acid preferences of these enzymes. All of these aldehydes were evaluated for inhibition against 10 human caspases, and the relevant kinetic parameters were determined. In every case, the observed inhibition was competitive and reversible. Potent inhibition was generally observed to be time-dependent, reflecting the low aldehyde concentrations employed and relatively small association rate constants for these inhibitors (0.08 × 105m−1 s−1 –4 × 105m−1 s−1). The results, summarized in Table I and shown graphically in Fig. 1, are in accord with the known substrate specificity of these enzymes and their catalytic efficiency for cleavage of tetrapeptide substrates. Group I caspases are relatively promiscuous; although Trp is preferred in aldehyde inhibitors, other amino acids are also well tolerated, such that all of the aldehydes tested had K i values <1 μm. Among these enzymes, the dissociation constants for caspase-4 and caspase-5 are significantly higher (average of 340-fold) than those for caspase-1, despite the fact that WEHD is the preferred tetrapeptide recognition sequence for all of these enzymes. This is consistent with the finding that caspase-4 and caspase-5 havek cat/K m values for cleavage of their preferred substrate, Ac-WEHD-AMC, that are ∼100-fold lower than that for caspase-1 under these conditions 3M. Garcia-Calvo, unpublished data. and the fact that aldehyde inhibitors of caspases are known to form a thiohemiacetal with the catalytic cysteine.Table IInhibition of caspases by peptide aldehydesEnzymeAldehyde K iWEHDYVADDEVDIETDAEVDnmGroup I Caspase-10.0560.7618<6<12 Caspase-497362132400375 Caspase-543163205223438Group II Caspase-31960>10,0000.2319542 Caspase-7>10,000>10,0001.63280425 Caspase-2>10,000>10,00017109400>10,000Group III Caspase-63090>10,000315.652 Caspase-821.13520.921.051.6 Caspase-95089706010848 Caspase-103304081227320 Open table in a new tab The only potent aldehyde inhibitor of Group II caspases is Ac-DEVD-CHO. This observation reflects the stringent specificity of these enzymes for Asp in their S4 subsites. As is observed with Group I caspases, the observed potency correlates with the catalytic efficiency of these enzymes for cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AMC. For example, Ac-DEVD-CHO is a potent inhibitor of caspase-3 (K i = 230 pm), a highly efficient catalyst with ak cat/K m value of 1.6 × 106m−1 s−1. In contrast, caspase-2 cleaves the tetrapeptide substrate poorly (k cat/K m = 24m−1 s−1) and is only weakly inhibited by this aldehyde (K i = 1.7 μm). Group III caspases are broadly inhibited by Boc-IETD-CHO, Ac-DEVD-CHO, and Boc-AEVD-CHO, with K i values ranging from ∼1 to 300 nm. As anticipated from the substrate specificity studies, Ac-WEHD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO are relatively poor inhibitors of this group of enzymes, consistent with the finding that hydrophobic amino acids in P4 are generally not well tolerated by members of this group and, in the case of Ac-YVAD-CHO, reflecting this group's stringent specificity for Glu in S3. The results obtained with the fluoromethyl ketone inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK are summarized in TableII. It was found to be a competitive and irreversible inhibitor of all 10 caspases. It is a broad specificity inhibitor, with second-order inactivation rates (k) that vary from 2.9 × 102m−1s−1 for caspase-2 to 2.8 × 105m−1 s−1 for caspase-1. These rate constants indicate that the half-life for irreversible inhibition at 1 μm inhibitor is ≤40 min for all of these enzymes.Table IIInhibition of caspases by Z-VAD-FMKEnzymekt 12 at 1 μmm−1s−1sGroup I Caspase-1280,0002.5 Caspase-45500130 Caspase-5130,0005.3Group II Caspase-316,00043 Caspase-718,00039 Caspase-22902400Group III Caspase-67,10098 Caspase-8280,0002.5 Caspase-9180,0003.9 Caspase-10ND2-aND, not determined.ND2-a ND, not determined.

Many studies have examined the cellular production of Aβ from its membrane-bound precursor, including the role of the presenilin proteins therein, but almost nothing is known about how Aβ is degraded and cleared following its secretion. We previously screened neuronal and nonneuronal cell lines for the production of proteases capable of degrading naturally secreted Aβ under biologically relevant conditions and concentrations. The major such protease identified was a metalloprotease released particularly by a microglial cell line, BV-2. We have now purified and characterized the protease and find that it is indistinguishable from insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a thiol metalloendopeptidase that degrades small peptides such as insulin, glucagon, and atrial natriuretic peptide. Degradation of both endogenous and synthetic Aβ at picomolar to nanomolar concentrations was completely inhibited by the competitive IDE substrate, insulin, and by two other IDE inhibitors. Immunodepletion of conditioned medium with an IDE antibody removed its Aβ-degrading activity. IDE was present in BV-2 cytosol, as expected, but was also released into the medium by intact, healthy cells. To confirm the extracellular occurrence of IDE in vivo, we identified intact IDE in human cerebrospinal fluid of both normal and Alzheimer subjects. In addition to its ability to degrade Aβ, IDE activity was unexpectedly found be associated with a time-dependent oligomerization of synthetic Aβ at physiological levels in the conditioned media of cultured cells; this process, which may be initiated by IDE-generated proteolytic fragments of Aβ, was prevented by three different IDE inhibitors.

Converging lines of evidence support the hypothesis that progressive cerebral accumulation of the 40–42-residue amyloid β-proteins (Aβs)1 is an early, invariant, and necessary step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a result, there is growing interest in decreasing cerebral Aβ levels as a therapeutic and preventative approach to the disease. Aβ is generated by endoproteolysis of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and secreted constitutively by most mammalian cells throughout life. Whereas many studies have examined the proteolytic processing of APP and the mechanisms of Aβ production, almost nothing is known about how Aβ peptides are normally degraded and cleared following their secretion. We recently screened the conditioned media of several different cell lines for Aβ-degrading activity and found that the principal such activity was conferred by a nonmatrix metalloprotease that was released by microglial cells and other cells and efficiently degraded both endogenous and synthetic Aβ (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The release of the protease from microglial cells was augmented by activating the cells with lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that physiological and pathological stimuli may regulate the degree of Aβ degradation in extracellular fluids (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The properties of the Aβ-degrading metalloprotease we described are reminiscent of those of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a metalloendopeptidase that can cleave a variety of small peptides, including insulin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor, and insulin-like growth factors I and II (reviewed in Refs. 2Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and 3Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar). IDE was recently identified as the protease responsible for the conversion of β-endorphin to γ-endorphin (4Safavi A. Miller B.C. Cottam L. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14318-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The protease was also recently reported to be present in human brain tissue, where it was shown to bind and cleave synthetic Aβ peptides at neutral pH (5Kurochkin I.V. Goto S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 6McDermott J.R. Gibson A.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, the latter studies relied on homogenized brain, so that IDE released from the cytosol could have conferred the Aβ-degrading activity nonphysiologically. Indeed, the two major reported locations of IDE in cell types studied to date, the cytosol and peroxisomes (3Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kuo W.-L. Gehm B.D. Rosner M.R. Li W. Keller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22599-22606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chesneau V. Perlman R.K. Li W. Keller G.-A. Rosner M.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3444-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), raise the question of whether and how this protease could function to degrade endogenous Aβ, considering that the peptide has not been found in these two subcellular sites. In this study, we have compared the properties of the extracellular, Aβ-degrading metalloprotease, which we previously described (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), with those of IDE and find that the two are indistinguishable. Partial purification of the protease from the conditioned medium of a microglial cell line demonstrates that the Aβ-degrading activity is IDE. This conclusion is confirmed by immunodepletion of IDE from conditioned medium. We further report experiments that suggest that the enzyme is released into the extracellular fluid by intact microglial cells that show no abnormal permeability. That such release occursin vivo in humans is confirmed by the immunochemical detection of authentic, 110-kDa IDE in freshly obtained lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition to a role for IDE in degrading secreted Aβ, we find that a time-dependent oligomerization of synthetic Aβ in the conditioned media of cultured cells is completely blocked by three different inhibitors of IDE activity. This finding suggests that IDE is capable of regulating the level of monomeric Aβ by both degradation and oligomerization. The implications of these findings for the fate of Aβ monomers and the role of Aβ accumulation in AD are discussed. Mouse BV-2 microglial cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To characterize Aβ-degrading activity in their conditioned media (CM), the cells were conditioned in either fresh RPMI 1640/10% FBS or the serum-free medium, N2, for 16–18 h, and the CM was passed through a 0.22-μm filter to remove floating cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with βAPP770 cDNA containing the V717F FAD mutation (7PA2 cells) (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and G418 (200 μg/ml). Confluent monolayers of 7PA2 cells in 10-cm dishes were preincubated for 30 min in methionine- and serum-free medium and labeled for 4 h with 300 μCi of [35S]methionine. The labeled CM were centrifuged at 2100 × g for 30 min and used immediately or stored at −70 °C. Two ml of labeled CM were mixed with 2 ml of unconditioned N2 medium (control) or BV-2 CM or fractions of the latter obtained during IDE purification (see below), either in the absence or presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or 1,10-phenanthroline or human insulin (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The amount of labeled Aβ remaining in each sample was assessed by immunoprecipitation with the high affinity Aβ polyclonal antibody R1282 followed by 10–20% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE and gel fluorography (9Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of BV-2 or human kidney 293 cells were detached from 15-cm dishes with 20 mm EDTA in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted. These cells or aliquots of frozen human brain tissue were suspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 msucrose, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture) and disrupted using 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer followed by four passages through a 25-gauge needle. Nuclei and unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatants from both centrifugation steps were combined and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 1 h to separate the cytosol and membrane fractions. Equal volumes of (a) cytosols prepared from BV-2 cells or human kidney 293 cells, (b) BV-2 CM (concentrated to a volume equal to that of the BV-2 cytosol by NH4SO4 precipitation), (c) human CSF, or (d) human CSF concentrated 10-fold by a Centricon 30 (Amicon) filter were electrophoresed on 10% Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (10Qiu W.Q.

The SuperSignal HisProbe Western blotting kit (Pierce) was used for immunoblotting IDE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal antibody 2BS, raised specifically against IDE (7Kuo W.-L. Gehm B.D. Rosner M.R. Li W. Keller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22599-22606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used at 1:10,000 dilution. 125I-Aβ (IAβ) (specific activity, ∼2000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, dissolved in H2O, aliquoted, and stored at −20o until use to avoid freeze/thawing. 10,000 cpm were added per ml of medium to whole cultures or their collected CM. After increasing intervals of incubation at 37 °C, aliquots of the media were removed, centrifuged, and examined by 10–20% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE and gel fluorography to observe any degradation or oligomerization of Aβ. At the same time, 90 μl of each aliquot was mixed with 110 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid and incubated on ice for 15 min to precipitate undegraded IAβ. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 10 min), and the amounts of label in the supernatant (representing degraded products) and the pellet (representing intact Aβ) were counted. Because partially degraded peptide products of Aβ may still be precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, this assay underestimates the absolute level of substrate degradation compared with assaying by SDS-PAGE/gel fluorography. BV-2 cells were routinely grown at 37 °C in RPMI, 10% FBS. At increasing intervals up to 24 h, CM were collected and filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate, and the amount of lactate dehydrogenase in each sample was measured by an in vitro toxicology assay (Sigma) according to instructions. In addition, BV-2 cells were grown in the presence or absence of 10% FBS at 37 °C for 24 h followed by the LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity assay (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay, polyanionic calcein is retained within live cells, producing an intense uniform green fluorescence (excitation/emission = 495/515 nm). Ethidium bromide, normally excluded, enters cells having damaged membranes and undergoes a 40-fold enhancement of fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids, thereby producing a bright red fluorescence in permeable cells (excitation/emission = 495/635 nm). As a positive control in these experiments, BV-2 cells were briefly treated (5 min) with digitonin (0.05%) to permeabilize them. BV-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS in T100 flasks for 3 days. The cells were collected, washed, changed to serum-free N2 medium, and further cultured for 16 h at 37 °C. Pooled CM (∼1 liter) were filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate to remove floating cells. The CM were precipitated with 40% NH4SO4, and the resultant supernatant was further precipitated with 60% NH4SO4. The latter precipitate was dissolved in ∼100 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and dialyzed in the same buffer overnight. The sample was assayed for Aβ-degrading activity by immunoprecipitation of endogenous Aβ with R1282 as described above and then applied to a Bio-Scale Q (Bio-Rad) anion exchange column, which was preequilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 10 mm to 1 m run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Aliquots of the resultant fractions (1.5 ml) were assayed for Aβ-degrading activity either by immunoprecipitation of [35S]Met-labeled endogenous Aβ or by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of synthetic IAβ, as described above. Fractions containing the most Aβ-degrading activity were pooled and concentrated to 200 μl by Centricon 30, followed by chromatography on a Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column. This column was equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the sample was eluted in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions (0.9 ml) were monitored for protein by UV absorbance at 280 nm, for Aβ-degrading activity and Aβ oligomer formation as described above, and for protein composition by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The fractions were also assayed for IDE by Western blotting with antibody 2BS. We recently reported that the clearance of secreted Aβ peptides from the media of several neural and nonneural cell lines was principally mediated by a nonmatrix metalloprotease released by these cells (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because the properties of the enzyme we described were similar to those of insulin-degrading enzyme, we further examined the metalloprotease with several reagents known to inhibit IDE. Using BV-2 microglial cells, which release higher levels of the Aβ-degrading metalloprotease than other cell types we screened (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent NEM. Confluent BV-2 cells were washed and changed to the serum-free medium, N2, for conditioning at 37 °C for 16 h. The CM were then filtered and collected. CHO cells stably transfected with APP770 cDNA containing the V717F mutation were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine as described (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the resultant medium, containing abundant labeled Aβ and p3 peptides, was incubated with the filtered BV-2 CM (or with unconditioned N2 medium as a control) for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of NEM. (p3 is a peptide comprising residues 17–40 (or 17–42) of Aβ that results from constitutive proteolysis of APP by α- and then γ-secretases, whereas Aβ (residues 1–40 or 1–42) results from constitutive proteolysis of APP by β- and then γ-secretases.) Subsequent immunoprecipitation with an Aβ antibody (R1282) and gel fluorography revealed the expected marked decrease of Aβ in the BV-2 CM, and this was completely inhibited by 100 μm NEM (Fig. 1 A). This result, together with the previously observed inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggests that Aβ degradation in BV-2 CM is specifically mediated by a thiol metalloprotease such as IDE. In parallel, we examined the degradation of iodinated insulin (10 pm) in the BV-2 CM and observed a time-dependent loss of intact insulin by SDS-PAGE that was similar to the degradation of iodinated Aβ1–40 at the same concentration. The insulin degradation was likewise inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline and NEM (data not shown). To further characterize the protease released by the microglial cells, we added the principal substrate of IDE, insulin, to the reaction mixture to determine whether insulin can compete out the Aβ-degrading activity. Degradation of endogenous Aβ in BV-2 CM was found to be progressively inhibited by increasing amounts of insulin between 100 nm and 10 μm (Fig. 1 B). One μm insulin inhibited degradation of Aβ by ∼50%, and 10 μm completely prevented the loss of Aβ. At the latter dose, insulin was as effective in this assay as 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 1 B), which we previously found to inhibit the Aβ-degrading metalloprotease completely (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To support the conclusion that it is IDE that degrades Aβ in BV-2 CM, we added other known substrates of IDE such as glucagon, transforming growth factor-α, or brain natriuretic peptide to the reaction mixture and showed that each of these inhibited the Aβ-degrading activity, but to a lesser extent than insulin did on a molar basis (data not shown). The p3 peptide is relatively resistant to degradation by the protease (Fig. 1, A and B), as reported previously (1Qiu W.Q. Ye Z. Kholodenko D. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6641-6646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this regard, the cleavage sites in synthetic Aβ1–40 generated by IDE purified from the cytosol of CHO cells have recently been localized to residues 4–5, 13–14, 14–15, and 20–21, 2A. Safavi and L. Hersh, unpublished data. potentially explaining the relative resistance of the p3 peptide (Aβ 17–40/42) to IDE-mediated degradation. To demonstrate directly the presence of IDE in the BV-2 CM, we used an IDE-specific polyclonal antibody, 2BS (11Kuo W.L. Montag A.G. Rosner M.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), to immunoblot the CM. Aliquots of human 293 cytosol (which contains abundant IDE and serves as a positive control), BV-2 cytosol, and BV-2 CM (concentrated by NH4SO4 precipitation to a volume equal to that of the BV-2 cytosol sample) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted with 2BS (Fig. 1 C). The mobilities of human IDE (lane 1) and mouse IDE (lanes 2 and 3) are slightly different. In all three samples, a characteristic 110-kDa protein was specifically immunolabeled, suggesting that BV-2 cells release intact IDE into their medium under our culture conditions. Because the above data suggested that IDE or an IDE-like protease can efficiently degrade Aβ, we substantially purified and further characterized the activity from ∼1 liter of CM of BV-2 cells conditioned in serum-free N2 medium at 37 °C for 16 h. The CM was subjected to sequential fractionation by ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography on a Bio-Scale Q column, and size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column (TableI). Aβ-degrading activity was monitored at each step by immunoprecipitation/gel fluorography of [35S]Met-labeled 7PA2 medium (for analyzing endogenous Aβ) or by the degradation of synthetic IAβ followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Any apparent oligomers of the IAβ (bands migrating above the 4-kDa monomer position) were simultaneously visualized by SDS-PAGE (12Podlisny M.B. Walsh D.M. Amarante P. Ostaszewski B.L. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochem. 1998; 37: 3602-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The final fractions obtained from the size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2 A) were incubated with IAβ, and those fractions that caused degradation in the absence but not the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline were identified by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (Fig. 2 B). Comparison of this proteolytic activity curve with the size standards showed that the Aβ-degrading moiety eluted from the column with a molecular mass of ∼100–150 kDa (Fig. 2, A and B). The Aβ-degrading activity of these fractions was further confirmed using the Aβ immunoprecipitation assay on endogenous([35S]Met-labeled) Aβ (Fig. 2 C). Western blotting with the 2BS antibody specifically identified intact 110-kDa IDE in the active fractions (Fig. 2 D), and its amount in each active fraction correlated closely with the relative Aβ-degrading activity of the fractions. Coomassie staining of the active fractions revealed the 110-kDa IDE band plus three or four other light bands (not shown), indicating marked enrichment but not full purification of IDE by this method. However, all of the other bands were equally or more abundant in fractions that had low or no Aβ-degrading activity. When the active column fractions (fractions 9–15) were incubated with IAβ followed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography, we observed the decrease in the IAβ monomer as well as an apparent SDS-stable oligomerization of some of the peptide (Fig. 2 E) (see below). Taken together, the results in Fig. 2 establish that the amount of IDE present in column fractions during purification correlates very closely with the degree of Aβ degradation.Table ISummary of partial purification of insulin-degrading enzyme from BV-2 CMPurification StepVolumeProteinTotal proteinYieldAβ-degrading activitymlmg/mlmg%BV-2CM10000.20200100+Ammonium sulfate800.1084+Bio-Scale Q150.081.20.6+Superose 122.70.110.30.15+ Open table in a new tab To prove unequivocally that IDE is the protease in CM responsible for the degradation of Aβ, we performed immunodepletion of CM with an IDE monoclonal antibody, 9B12 (5Kurochkin I.V.

In parallel with the removal of Aβ-degrading activity, immunodepletion of IDE simultaneously removed insulin-degrading activity (Table II).

One explanation for this finding could be that the cells are more prone to injury in the absence of serum and thus release more protease, particularly in light of the general assumption that IDE is localized to cytosol and not normally released by intact cells. To address this issue, we used a highly sensitive assay to detect Aβ degradation in the presence of 10% FBS; 125I-labeled synthetic Aβ (∼20 pm) served as the substrate and was incubated in whole BV-2 cultures or in their CM alone. The loss of intact IAβ during a 24-h incubation was assayed by quantitating trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts, a method widely used to study the degradation of other iodinated substrates of IDE (e.g. Refs. 6McDermott J.R. Gibson A.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar and 13Garcia J.V. Stoppelli M.P. Decker S.J. Rosner M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in both the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble pellets (representing intact peptide) and the supernatant (representing the products) was measured. Because partially degraded fragments of Aβ may still be precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, this assay underestimates the absolute level of substrate cleavage. Whole BV-2 cultures degraded ∼50% of the extracellular IAβ during an 18-h incubation (Fig. 3 A), and this was completely inhibited by 10 μm insulin (Fig. 3 B). We also performed this experiment on cultures of M17 human neuroblastoma cells and rat PC12 cells. Substantially less degradation of IAβ occurred in M17 then in BV-2 cultures, and the PC12 cultures showed very little or no detectable degradation under the same conditions (data not shown). Because both M17 and PC12 cells have similar amounts of IDE in their cytoplasm as do BV-2 cells (not shown), the secretion of IDE activity capable of mediating extracellular Aβ degradation is cell type-dependent and does not simply reflect nonspecific release in cell culture. Because the loss of intact IAβ in whole cultures could be due to a mixture of cell-based and secreted activities, we asked whether just the CM of BV-2 cells is sufficient to mediate the degradation of Aβ seen in the above experiments. IAβ was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C solely in the CM of BV-2 cells conditioned in the presence of 10% FBS. The CM degraded ∼50% of the IAβ during the incubation (Fig. 3 C), similar to the whole cultures, and this was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 3 D), NEM (Fig. 3 E), and insulin (Fig. 3 F). These results clearly indicate that Aβ degradation is largely mediated by extracellular IDE activity in BV-2 cultures. To confirm that this release of IDE into the culture medium occurs while BV-2 cell membranes are intact, we simultaneously assayed lactate dehydrogenase activity in the CM of cultures conditioned in 10% FBS and found no significant release of this cytoplasmic enzyme at time points up to 24 h (Fig. 4 F). To prove further the intactness of the plasma membrane, the LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity assay was performed on BV-2 cells cultured in the presence (Fig. 4,A and B) or absence (Fig. 4, C and D) of 10% FBS for up to 24 h. We observed no significant cell death (by calcein AM signal and ethidium bromide staining) even in the absence of serum, whereas sister cultures permeabilized briefly with digitonin (0.05%) were clearly positive in this assay (Fig. 4 E). Taken together, these several assays provide no evidence that the release of proteolytically active IDE from the BV-2 microglial cells occurs as a secondary result of cell injury. Although there have been reports of the release of IDE from cells (14Roth R.A. Mesirow M.L. Cassell D.J. Yokono K. Baba S. Diabetes Res. Clin.

This oxidative stress-induced activity promotes the production of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can contribute to the pathology of many disease states associated with aging. The administration to aged mice of agents capable of activating the α isoform of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) was found to restore the cellular redox balance, evidenced by a lowering of tissue lipid peroxidation, an elimination of constitutively active NF-κB, and a loss in spontaneous inflammatory cytokine production. Aged animals bearing a null mutation in PPARα failed to elicit these changes following treatment with PPARα activators, but remained responsive to vitamin E supplementation. Aged C57BL/6 mice were found to express reduced transcript levels of PPARα and the peroxisome-associated genes acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase. Supplementation of these aged mice with PPARα activators or with vitamin E caused elevations in these transcripts to levels seen in young animals.

Multicellular organisms have evolved complex homeostatic mechanisms to sense and respond to a diverse range of exogenous and endogenous signals. One such mechanism appears to require the biochemical events which follow the activation of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR).1 PPARs are members of the nuclear steroid hormone receptor superfamily and function to transduce a variety of environmental, nutritional, and inflammatory signals into a defined set of cellular responses (1Lemberger T.

While PPARs had long been considered to be orphan receptors, recent reports indicate that a number of natural and xenobiotic ligands with specificity for PPARs do indeed exist. The first ligands described were the insulin-sensitizing thiazoladinediones which are specific ligands for the PPARγ isoform (10Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M.

Since that time, a number of natural endogenous molecules have been found to be capable of activating PPARs. For example, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14prostaglandin J2 represents a natural PPARγ ligand (11Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Wilson T.W. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M.

Studies employing the PPARα-deficient mouse have also revealed that the natural steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone-3β-sulfate (DHEAS) is a specific activator of PPARα (19Peters J.M. Zhou Y.-C. Ram P.A. Lee S.S.T. Gonzalez F.J. Waxman D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 67-74PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a vast array of man-made compounds are capable of activating PPARα. These include the synthetic arachidonic acid analog eicosatetrayeinoic acid, the hypolipidemic agents WY-14,643 and clofibrate, certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, phthalate ester plasticizers, plus a number of other xenobiotic compounds (1Lemberger T.

Based upon their capacity to elicit cellular responses to a variety of stimuli, the PPARs may represent a class of molecules which allow the biochemical adaptation to a diverse range of internal and external signals. These include nutritional and inflammatory agents as well as a number of potentially toxic substances. PPARα activation results in the transcriptional up-regulation of many genes, including those involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, some lipid binding proteins and apolipoproteins, certain isozymes of the cytochrome P450 family, and antioxidant enzymes (1Lemberger T.

There is strong evidence to suggest that the deleterious changes to the immune system that occur as an individual or experimental animal ages, including a reduced capacity to be effectively vaccinated and the dysregulated production of a number of pleiotropic cytokines, are associated with a decreased ability to effectively handle oxidative stress (29Bunker V.W.

The redox-regulated and oxidant stress-activated transcription factor NF-κB has been reported to be active in the heart, liver, kidney, brain, and cardiac muscle of aged experimental animals, without alterations in the amounts of NF-κB subunits or of the inhibitory molecule IκBα present in the cytosol (37Helenius H. Hanninen M. Lehtinen S.K. Salminen A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 38Helenius M. Hanninen M. Lehtinen S.K. Salminen A. Biochem.

Under resting conditions, NF-κB exists in the cytoplasm as a dimer bound to the inhibitory protein IκB. Signaling by various cell stimuli appear to converge at the generation of increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IκB and its release from NF-κB. The NF-κB dimer then translocates to the nucleus and binds to the promoter region of genes possessing a κB motif (consensus GGGRNNT(Y)CC), thereby causing recruitment of transcriptional machinery and induction of gene transcription (40Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that NF-κB is also present in an active state in the macrophages and lymphocytes which reside in the spleens of aged mice (34Spencer N.F.L. Poynter M.E. Im S.-Y. Daynes R.A. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This active NF-κB was demonstrated to correlate with the expression of the NF-κB-regulated genes IL-6, IL-12, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, cyclooxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (34Spencer N.F.L. Poynter M.E. Im S.-Y. Daynes R.A. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We found that the administration of specific PPARα activators or the dietary antioxidant vitamin E to aged rodents effectively reduced the elevated levels of active NF-κB, reestablished control over proinflammatory cytokine production, and reduced lipid peroxide levels in various tissues (34Spencer N.F.L. Poynter M.E. Im S.-Y. Daynes R.A. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for PPARα in the maintenance of redox balance during the aging process. The studies presented herein demonstrate that low dose DHEAS or WY-14,643 administration to aged animals elicits a number of biologic changes, which are mediated through a process involving PPARα activation. We employed a strain of mice bearing a null mutation in PPARα (PPARα −/−) to experimentally demonstrate that normal PPARα function is necessary to effectively maintain a balance in cellular redox state. PPARα −/− mice were found to express indicators of oxidative stress much earlier in their lifespans than wild-type mice. Administration of PPARα-specific activators to wild-type and knockout animals was capable of reducing the age-associated elevations in NF-κB activity and constitutive pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the PPARα wild-type animals but not their PPARα-deficient counterparts. Vitamin E supplementation lowered the levels of active NF-κB present in the spleens of both aged wild-type and aged knockout animals. Similar results were obtained using young PPARα +/+ and PPARα −/− mice rendered redox-imbalanced at an early age by feeding a vitamin E-deficient diet. In addition, a decline in cellular PPARα expression was observed to occur with normal aging. This was accompanied by similarly reduced levels of acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase mRNA expression, enzymes that are transcriptionally up-regulated following administration of PPARα activators. Either vitamin E supplementation or treatment of aged mice with PPARα activators was able to cause elevations in splenic PPARα, acyl-CoA oxidase, and catalase mRNA to levels typically observed in the spleens of young animals. Our findings indicate that the therapeutic administration of PPARα activators is able to regulate cellular oxidant/antioxidant balance through a mechanism that appears to require a functional PPARα. Colonies of PPARα wild type (PPARα +/+) and homozygous knockout (PPARα −/−) mice were expanded from breeding pairs obtained from Dr. F. J. Gonzalez (Metabolism Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The derivation and phenotypic characteristics of these animals have previously been reported (41Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Female mice were used for all of the experiments reported herein. Six-week-old and 20–24-month-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Institute on Aging. All mice were housed in the University of Utah Animal Resource Center, which routinely monitors for the most prevalent murine pathogens, employs sentinel animals as a means for early detection of murine hepatitis virus, and guarantees strict compliance with regulations established by the Animal Welfare Act. Normal maintenance chow, vitamin E-deficient (tocopherol-stripped) chow, and vitamin E-containing control chow were purchased from Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI). Mice were anesthetized with halothane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Any mice with evidence of gross internal or external pathology at the time of sacrifice were excluded from the study. DHEAS (5-androsten-3β-ol-17-one 3-sulfate) (Sigma), dissolved directly in the drinking water at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, was prepared fresh on a weekly basis and was available to the mice ad libitum, resulting in doses of approximately 300–500 μg/day. WY-14,643 ([4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio] acetic acid) (Chemsyn Science Laboratories, Lenexa, KS) was added directly to the chow resulting in 250 μg/day doses. α-Tocopherol (Sigma) was applied to the chow in order to achieve a supplemental vitamin E dose of 4.6 mg/day. Peroxisome-proliferating doses of DHEA (5-androsten-3β-ol-17-one) (Sigma) and WY-14,643 were provided in the chow at 0.5% w/w (25 mg/day) and 0.1% w/w (5 mg/day), respectively. Freshly prepared food was provided every 2–3 days and was continuously available to the mice during the 2-week supplementation period. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cell suspensions of whole spleens using a modified protocol of Dignam et al. (42Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmDTT, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min on ice, vortexing every 2 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed with 1 ml of buffer A without Nonidet P-40. 25 μl of buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mmPMSF, and 1 mm DTT) was added to the pellet and, following sonication for 10 s, incubated for 30 min on ice. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, the protein content of the nuclear extract determined (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed. While contamination of the nuclear extracts with small quantities of cytosolic proteins is possible, cytosolic NF-κB will not bind DNA due to its association with the inhibitory molecule IκB (44Frankenberger M. Pforte A. Sternsdorf T. Passlick B. Baeuerle P.A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts (2 μg of protein) were incubated with 30,000 cpm of 32P labeled NF-κB specific probe (Promega). Reactions were performed in a 20-μl total volume containing 2 μg of nuclear extract, 4 μl of 5× gel shift binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol), 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μl of probe. For supershift assays, 2 μl of an appropriate anti-NF-κB subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to each reaction. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, loaded on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, and run in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. NF-κB-specific bands were confirmed by competition with a 50-fold excess of an unlabeled NF-κB probe, which resulted in no shifted band, or by preparing the reaction with excess labeled nonspecific probe, which did not reduce the intensity of the NF-κB band. Cells obtained from the spleens of PPARα +/+ or PPARα −/− animals were cultured under serum-free conditions. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with halothane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Single cell suspensions were prepared from the spleens of these animals. The collected splenocytes were washed three times in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and cultured at 107 cells/ml in freshly prepared serum-free medium consisting of RPMI 1640, 1% Nutridoma-SR (Boehringer Mannheim), 200 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, and 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cell culture supernatants were then collected for quantitative evaluation of immunoactive IL-6 or IL-12 (p40) by ELISA, as described previously (45Spencer N.F.L. Norton S.D. Harrison L.L. Li G.Z. Daynes R.A. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Monoclonal rat anti-murine cytokine antibodies and murine recombinant IL-6 and IL-12 cytokine standards were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). mRNA was prepared by the method of Chomczynski (46Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and RT-PCR was performed with adaptations for rapid cycling with the 1605 air thermocycler (Idaho Technology, Idaho Falls, ID), as described previously (45Spencer N.F.L. Norton S.D. Harrison L.L. Li G.Z. Daynes R.A. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were: denaturation, 94 °C for 1 s, annealing for 1 s, and elongation, 72 °C for 8 s. 16 cycles were performed for β-actin and 30 cycles were performed for PPARα, acyl-CoA oxidase, and catalase. Gene-specific sequences were derived from GenBank submissions. Oligonucleotides and annealing temperatures (AT) used for these analyses are as follows: β-actin (AT = 60 °C): 5′-GGG TCA GAA GGA CTC CTA TG-3′ and 5′-GTA ACA ATG CCA TGT TCA AT-3′. PPARα (AT = 55 °C): 5′-GTG GCT GCT ATA ATT TGC TGT G-3′ and 5′-GAA GGT GTC ATC TGG ATG GGT G-3′. Acyl-CoA oxidase (AT = 55 °C): 5′-CGA CCT TGT TCG GGC AAG TGA GGC GC-3′ and 5′-GGA GCT CAG ACG TGT CCC AGG G-3′. Catalase (AT = 55 °C): 5′-ATG TCG GAC AGT CGG GAC C-3′ and 5′-CAT GTC AGG ATC CTT CAG G-3′. Following PCR, the samples were mixed with an equal volume of stop solution, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide gel. Bands were detected by autoradiographic exposure for 16 h at −70 °C. Sizes of the bands were determined by comparing to the migration pattern of a 32P-end-labeledMspI digest of pBR322 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Immediately following sacrifice, mouse livers were perfused with cold 0.9% NaCl via the portal vein prior to removal. Livers were weighed, and 10% homogenates were prepared in 1.15% KCl using a Tissue Tearor homogenizer. Supernatants obtained by centrifugation at 3500 × g of liver homogenates were either left on ice or subjected to an oxidative stressin vitro by incubating them for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm FeSO4, after which time EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Lipid peroxides were assayed using a modified procedure of Buege and Aust (47Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10916) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μl of 10% tissue homogenate or working standard (1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane; Sigma) was added to 500 μl of TCA-TBA-HCl reagent (15% w/w trichloroacetic acid, 0.375% w/v thiobarbituric acid, 0.25 n hydrochloric acid). The resulting mixture was vortexed and heated at 95 °C for 15 min. The mixture was then cooled on ice for 15 min, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 535 nm was determined using a Molecular Devices multiwell plate spectrophotometer. The degree of lipid peroxidation was expressed as concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) participating in the reaction per gram of tissue. While expanding the PPARα +/+ and PPARα −/− mouse colonies, it became apparent that the body weights of 14-week-old PPARα −/− mice were greater than age-matched PPARα +/+ mice. As has been described previously (48Lee S.S.T. Gonzalez F.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 49Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Ward J.M. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 117-121Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), an observed 30% increase in body weight persisted throughout adulthood, and the overweight phenotype was more exaggerated in males. Gross pathologic examination revealed a markedly increased amount of intraabdominal adipose tissue in the PPARα −/− mice (data not shown). The recent report that PPARα −/− mice demonstrate reduced basal levels of mitochondrial fat-metabolizing enzymes may offer an explanation for these observations (23Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). An inability to efficiently catabolize fatty acids would cause them to be redirected for storage in adipose tissue, thereby accounting for the obese phenotype of PPARα −/− mice. The reported inability of PPARα −/− mice to transcriptionally up-regulate enzymes for fatty acid catabolism in response to administration of PPARα activators may be why these mice exhibit lipid droplets in their livers following an overnight fast (48Lee S.S.T. Gonzalez F.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,49Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Ward J.M. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 117-121Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that endogenous molecules (i.e. fatty acids) are not capable of activating PPARα, or of being enzymatically metabolized, in the PPARα −/− mice. When splenocytes were obtained from 4-month-old PPARα +/+ and PPARα −/− mice and analyzed by EMSA for NF-κB activity, PPARα +/+ mice did not express nuclear NF-κB activity in their spleens, while age-matched PPARα −/− mice already exhibited high levels of nuclear NF-κB activity (Fig. 1 A). In vitroactivation of splenocytes from PPARα +/+ and PPARα −/− mice with a low dose of LPS (10 ng/ml) was able to modestly increase nuclear NF-κB activity in both groups (Fig. 1 A). The levels of NF-κB activity seen in splenocytes from 4-month-old PPARα +/+ mice following activation with LPS, however, did not reach the levels seen in splenocytes from age-matched PPARα −/− mice in the absence of exogenous activators (Fig. 1 A). The secretion of two NF-κB-driven cytokines, IL-6 and IL-12, by either control or LPS-activated splenocytes from PPARα +/+ and PPARα −/− mice was quantitated by ELISA. PPARα −/− splenocytes were found to produce 2–3 times more IL-6 and IL-12, both in the absence of exogenous stimulation (Fig. 1 B) and following activation with LPS (Fig. 1 C), than splenocytes from PPARα +/+ mice. We questioned whether the effects that we have previously reported to occur following the administration to aged mice of natural and xenobiotic agents capable of activating PPARα (45Spencer N.F.L.

Daynes, submitted for publication. were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARα. PPARα +/+ and PPARα −/− mice at 2 and 15 months of age were compared in these studies. As has been previously demonstrated with C57BL/6 strain mice (45Spencer N.F.L. Norton S.D. Harrison L.L. Li G.Z. Daynes R.A. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), both PPARα +/+, and PPARα −/− mice at 2 months of age exhibited only minimal levels of nuclear NF-κB activity in their spleens (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W1965477067,"Abstract We investigated the transport of cationic neurotoxins and neurotransmitters by the potential-sensitive organic transporter OCT3 and its steroid sensitivity using heterologous expression systems and also analyzed the expression of OCT3 in the brain. When expressed in mammalian cells, OCT3 mediates the uptake of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and the neurotransmitter dopamine. Competition experiments show that several cationic neuroactive agents including amphetamines interact with OCT3. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, OCT3-mediated MPP+ uptake is associated with inward currents under voltage-clamp conditions. The MPP+-induced currents are saturable with respect to MPP+ concentration, and half-maximal saturation (K 0.5) occurs at about 25 μm MPP+ with membrane potential clamped at −50 mV. The K 0.5 for MPP+ is markedly influenced by membrane potential. OCT3 is inhibited by several steroids, and β-estradiol is the most potent inhibitor (K i ∼1 μm). The pattern of steroid sensitivity of OCT3 is different from that of OCT1 and OCT2 but correlates significantly with that of the extraneuronal monoamine transporter (uptake2). The transport characteristics and steroid sensitivity provide strong evidence for the molecular identity of OCT3 as uptake2. OCT3 is expressed in the brain as evidenced from Northern blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization using OCT3-specific probes. The molecular identity of the transcript hybridizing to the probe has been established by sequencing the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction product and also by the isolation of the OCT3 cDNA from a brain cDNA library. Regional distribution studies with in situ hybridization show that OCT3 is expressed widely in different brain regions, especially in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. OCT3 is likely to play a significant role in the disposition of cationic neurotoxins and neurotransmitters in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2118593499,"The voltage-gated potassium channel in T lymphocytes, Kv1.3, is an important molecular target for immunosuppressive agents. A structurally defined polypeptide, ShK, from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthusinhibited Kv1.3 potently and also blocked Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and Kv1.6 at subnanomolar concentrations. Using mutant cycle analysis in conjunction with complementary mutagenesis of ShK and Kv1.3, and utilizing the structure of ShK, we determined a likely docking configuration for this peptide in the channel. Based upon this topological information, we replaced the critical Lys22 in ShK with the positively charged, non-natural amino acid diaminopropionic acid (ShK-Dap22) and generated a highly selective and potent blocker of the T-lymphocyte channel. ShK-Dap22, at subnanomolar concentrations, suppressed anti-CD3 induced human T-lymphocyte [3H]thymidine incorporation in vitro. Toxicity with this mutant peptide was low in a rodent model, with a median paralytic dose of ∼200 mg/kg body weight following intravenous administration. The overall structure of ShK-Dap22 in solution, as determined from NMR data, is similar to that of native ShK toxin, but there are some differences in the residues involved in potassium channel binding. Based on these results, we propose that ShK-Dap22 or a structural analogue may have use as an immunosuppressant for the prevention of graft rejection and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Earlier studies showed that structurally dissimilar blockers of this channel suppressed mitogen-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation and interleukin-2 production by T lymphocytes (1Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G.

The critical role of Kv1.3 during T-cell activation, coupled with its functionally restricted tissue distribution, has stimulated a search for potent and selective Kv1.3 antagonists for potential use as immunosuppressants (e.g. see Refs. 8Kath J.C.

Many potent polypeptide inhibitors of Kv1.3 have been isolated from scorpion venom. These polypeptides adopt well defined conformations constrained by 3 or 4 disulfide bonds and bind with extremely high affinity to a shallow vestibule at the external entrance to the Kv1.3 pore (10Aiyar J.

Extensive efforts are therefore ongoing to identify other more selective and potent peptide and non-peptide inhibitors of Kv1.3. Recently, a 35-amino acid-residue polypeptide (ShK) from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus was shown to block the Kv1.3 channel at low picomolar concentrations (15Pennington M.W. Mahnir V.M.

Like scorpion toxins, ShK has a well defined conformation constrained by three disulfide bonds, minimizing possible structural changes upon its binding to the channel. However, the structure of ShK is significantly different from those of scorpion toxins (17Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K. Pennington M.W. Norton R.S. Nat. Struct.

Despite differences in the scaffolds, the sea anemone and scorpion toxins share a conserved diad of residues that is essential for block of potassium channels (16Pennington M.W. Mahnir V.M.

This diad consists of a critical lysine (Lys27 in the scorpion toxins and Lys22 and Lys25 in ShK and BgK) and a neighboring aromatic residue (Tyr36 in ChTX, Tyr23 in ShK, Tyr26in BgK) separated by ∼7 Å (19Dauplais M.

A better understanding of the interactions between ShK and the Kv1.3 channel may guide the design of specific ShK mutants with the potential to be used clinically as immunosuppressants. Here, we describe a mutant polypeptide that shows selectivity for Kv1.3, inhibits T-cell activation in vitro, and is minimally toxic in vivo. Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were obtained from Bachem A.G. (CH-4416 Bubendorf, Switzerland). Solid-phase assembly was initiated with Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-2-chlorotrityl resin to minimize potential racemization of the C-terminal Cys residue (21Fujiwara Y. Akaji K. Kiso Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994; 42: 724-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Automated stepwise assembly was carried out entirely on an ABI-431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Fmoc-Dap(t-butyloxycarbonyl) was substituted in place of Lys22 in the assembly of the polypeptide. The Dap22-substituted polypeptide was cleaved and deprotected with reagent K (22King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1990; 6: 255-266Google Scholar) containing 5% triisopropylsilane. The ShK-Dap22 analogue was solubilized, oxidized, and purified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography using the same method described previously for other ShK analogues (15Pennington M.W.

High pressure liquid chromatography-pure fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The structure and purity of the peptides were confirmed by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography, amino acid analysis, and electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy analysis. All other ShK analogues were synthesized, purified, and characterized as reported previously (15Pennington M.W. Mahnir V.M. Krafte D.S. Zaydenberg I. Byrnes M.E. Khaytin I. Crowley K. Kem W.R.

Rat Kv1.6 and rKv3.4 were gifts from Dr. Olaf Pongs (ZMNH Hamburg, Germany). 125I-ChTX was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Fetal calf serum andl-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was acquired from Biomeda Inc (Foster City, CA). Membranes were prepared from a cell line stably transfected with the hKv1.3channel. The membranes were suspended at 50 μg/ml in incubation buffer (5 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mmHEPES, 6 mm glucose, pH 8.4) in Falcon 96-well polystyrene plates. Peptides were added in triplicate to wells at various concentrations. Cold ShK, ShK-Dap22, or MgTX was added to the membranes for 30 min; 125I-ChTX (25 pm, 2200 Ci/mmol) was then added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 22 °C for a further 20 min. The reaction was stopped by harvesting the membranes onto Packard GF/C Unifilter 96-well filter plates and by washing twice rapidly with ice-cold wash buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0). The filter plates were dried overnight, scintillation mixture (Packard Microscint-20; Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT) was added, and the plates were counted in a scintillation counter (Packard Top Count). Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding (defined by 100 nm unlabeled ChTX) from total binding. This binding assay was protein dependent, saturable (Bmax = 916 ± 37 fmol/mg protein), and of high affinity (K d = 23 pm). Several doses of ShK or ShK-Dap22 were administered by intravenous tail vein injection into 15–20-g Swiss-Webster male mice. Loss of righting ability (paralysis) was assessed over a 4-h period. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated over a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (Sigma). The isolated MNCs were incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2) for ≤2 days in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The assay was conducted in a 96-well plate by first adding monoclonal anti-CD3 and various polypeptide concentrations to wells in triplicate. Anti-CD3 was titrated to dilutions that produced a 4–25-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. MNCs were resuspended in fresh media and then added to wells at a final concentration of 0.3 × 106 cells/well (final volume 200 μl). For determination of background uptake, anti-CD3 was not added to six wells in each plate, and the average [3H]thymidine uptake from these wells subtracted from wells containing anti-CD3. Plates were incubated for 48 h, and [3H]thymidine was added during the last 6 h. The contents of the wells were harvested onto glass fiber filters (Packard GF/C unifilters) using a multi-well harvester, and cells were lysed with water. Filters were air-dried overnight. Scintillation mixture (Packard Microscint-20) was added, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured by counting in a scintillation counter. Each construct was linearized withEcoRI and transcribed in vitro (8Kath J.C. Hanson D.C. Chandy K.G. Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 1997; 32: 181-190Google Scholar, 10Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P.

Cells measured in the whole cell configuration were normally bathed in mammalian Ringer solution containing (in mm) 160 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, with an osmolarity of 290–320 mosm. A simple syringe-driven perfusion system was used to exchange the bath solutions in the recording chamber. The internal pipette solution for Kv channel recordings contained (in mm) 134 potassium fluoride, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.2 (with KOH), with an osmolarity of 290–320 mosm.

Series resistance compensation (80%) was used if the current exceeded 2 nA. Capacitative and leak currents were subtracted using the P/8 or P/10 procedure.

Whole oocytes were held at –100 mV and depolarized to +40 mV over 500 ms; time between pulses was 30 s. Capacitative and leak currents were subtracted prior to analysis using the P/4 procedure. The dissociation constant was calculated assuming a 1:1 binding of toxin to Kv1.3 as described (10Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M.

This method provides a simple way to evaluate the strength of interaction between any two pairs of protein residues (25Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). For each mutant cycle, we measured the potency (K d) of ShK and each of its mutants on Kv1.3 and each of the channel mutants. Three positively charged ShK residues, Lys9, Arg11, and Lys22, were replaced individually by the neutral residues alanine (Ala) or norleucine (Nle). In the mutant cycle studies, the wild-type polypeptide was compared against the corresponding neutral polypeptide. In addition, we replaced Lys22 with the non-natural positively charged residues, diaminopropionic acid (Dap) or ornithine (Orn). These residues vary in their side chain lengths (Dap = 2.5 Å, Orn = 5.0 Å, Nle = 5.0 Å, Lys = 6.3 Å). The positively charged position-22 mutants (along with Lys22) were treated as wild-type in the mutant cycle analysis and compared against the mutant polypeptide containing the neutral residue Nle22. Four residues of the Kv1.3 channel were selected for mutagenesis: His404, Asp402, Tyr400, and Asp386. His404 was replaced with the hydrophobic residue Val, and Asp386 was replaced with Lys. As substitutions at positions 400 and 402 result in nonfunctional channels, we generated dimeric constructs containing one wild-type subunit and one mutant subunit. The resulting tetramers would be composed of (Asn4022,Asp4022) and (Val4002,Tyr4002). All of these channel mutants and the dimeric constructs have been used previously in mapping studies with kaliotoxin (10Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J.

The mutant cycles for Kv1.3-His404 and various ShK residues are shown as follows: Kv1.3(His404 → Val404)-ShK(Arg11 → Ala11), Kv1.3(His404 → Val404)-ShK(Lys9→ Ala9), Kv1.3(His404 → Val404)-ShK(Lys22 → Nle22), Kv1.3(His404 → Val404)-ShK(Dap22→ Nle22), and Kv1.3(His404 → Val404)-ShK(Orn22 → Nle22). Similar cycles were constructed to measure coupling interactions between Asp386 (Asp386 → Lys386), Asp402 (Asp4024 → Asn4022,Asp4022), Tyr400 (Tyr4004 → Val4002,Tyr4002), and polypeptide positions 9, 11, and 22. The change in coupling energy, ΔΔG, for a given pair of ShK-Kv1.3 residues and their mutants was calculated using the formula ΔΔG = kTlnΩ, where Ω is a dimensionless value given by the formula Ω = [K d (Wt ShK-Wt Kv1.3) × K d (mut ShK-mut Kv1.3)]/[K d (mut ShK-Wt Kv1.3) ×K d (Wt ShK-mut Kv1.3)]. For Ω values <1 the inverse was taken (10Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M. Dethlefs B. Lee C-L. Hall J.E. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G.

Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) reported that ΔΔG values of ≥0.5 kcal·mol−1 (2ς error) correspond to an inter-residue distance of ≤5 Å, and higher ΔΔG values match shorter inter-residue distances. We used a ΔΔG value of >0.8 kcal·mol−1 as an indicator of a close interaction (≤5 Å) between a pair of peptide and channel residues. Although high ΔΔG values indicate tight interactions, residues that are physically close may be energetically “silent” and may not be detected by this method (26Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). All of the peptide-mapping studies were performed on channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, whereas the studies described in Fig. 1were performed on channels expressed in mammalian cells. In general, there was good correspondence between the K d values measured on channels expressed in mammalian cells and oocytes, although ShK-Dap22 was about 6-fold more potent in the oocyte system (K d = 3.3 ± 1.9 pm,n = 12) compared with mammalian cells (see Fig. 1). Two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz on a ∼2 mm solution of synthetic ShK-Dap22 in 90% H2O, 10%2H2O (v/v) or 100%2H2O at pH 4.9 and 293 K, as described (17Tudor J.E. Pallaghy P.K.

Spectra were also recorded at 278 K in an attempt to sharpen backbone amide resonances from Ser2, Cys3, Met21, Dap22, and Tyr23. Chemical shifts for Dap resonances in the synthetic peptide GlyGlyDapGlyGly-OH were measured from one-dimensional and total correlation spectroscopy spectra at 293 and 298 K in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O at pH 5.0, using 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as internal standard. A figure (Fig. S1) included in the “Appendix” summarizes the sequential assignments, slowly exchanging amides, backbone coupling constants, and medium-range NOEs for ShK-Dap22, together with a table of 1H chemical shifts (Table SI).

The aim of this study was to examine the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of α-tocopherol on O⨪2 production by human monocytes. In activated monocytes O⨪2 is produced by the NADPH-oxidase enzyme complex. The oxidase activation elicited by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) requires membrane translocation of several cytosolic factors. We found that in human PMA-stimulated adherent monocytes, α-tocopherol (but not β-tocopherol) inhibited O⨪2production in intact cells but had no effect on a membrane preparation containing activated NADPH-oxidase, suggesting that α-tocopherol impairs the assembly process of the enzyme complex. We showed that translocation and phosphorylation of the cytosolic factor p47phox were reduced in monocytes preincubated with α-tocopherol. We verified that the tryptic phosphopeptide map of monocyte p47phox was similar to that of neutrophil p47phox, indicating that several serine residues were phosphorylated. Peptides whose phosphorylation is dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) were phosphorylated to a lesser degree when p47phox was immunoprecipitated from α-tocopherol-treated monocytes. In vitro, the activity of PKC from monocytes was inhibited by α-tocopherol in a specific manner compared with that of β-tocopherol or Trolox®. Membrane translocation of PKC was not affected. These results show that α-tocopherol inhibits O⨪2production by human adherent monocytes by impairing the assembly of the NADPH-oxidase and suggest that the inhibition of phosphorylation and translocation of the cytosolic factor p47phox results from a decrease in PKC activity.

Biophys. 1988; 264: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).The purpose of this study was to explore the underlying mechanism of α-tocopherol-induced inhibition of O⨪2 production by monocytes. We found that α-tocopherol treatment of human adherent monocytes inhibited PMA-induced translocation and phosphorylation of the cytosolic oxidase component p47phox.DISCUSSIONIn this study α-tocopherol depressed the PMA-induced respiratory burst of human adherent monocytes without affecting the assembled oxidase activity of membrane preparations originating from PMA-activated monocytes or neutrophils. This strongly suggests that the α-tocopherol inhibition of O⨪2 production is at least in part related to a functional impairment of the NADPH-oxidase assembly. Indeed, we found that α-tocopherol inhibited p47phoxtranslocation to the membrane and impaired p47phoxphosphorylation.In human neutrophils, oxidase activation by PMA is believed to be mediated by PKC (15el Benna J.

The results described here in human monocytes suggest that the PKC pathway is involved in O⨪2 production, as PMA-induced p47phox phosphorylation was inhibited by GF109203X (Fig. 3 A), a potent inhibitor of PKC (25Toullec D.

The lack of effect of α-tocopherol on basal activity of unstimulated cells suggests that PKC isoforms that can be activated by PMA are sensitive to α-tocopherol.The mechanism by which α-tocopherol interacts with PKC is unclear. In our model α-tocopherol failed to inhibit PKC translocation to the membrane (Fig. 5), suggesting that it modulates only the activity of membrane-bound enzyme. In vitro, α-tocopherol inhibited monocyte PKC activity only when α-tocopherol was incorporated in PS/DG liposomes (Fig. 6). There was no action when α-tocopherol was supplied as a solution in ethanol (data not shown) or when it was replaced by Trolox, a hydrophilic analog of α-tocopherol that is unable to penetrate liposomes but has a preserved antioxidant moiety (Fig. 6). These results suggest that α-tocopherol incorporation into the lamellar (pseudo-membrane) structure of liposomes is a prerequisite for its inhibitory action on PKC. Tocopherol compounds have been shown to alter the structural organization of liposomes (26Urano S. Yano K. Matsuo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Several lipids known to incorporate into membrane structures are able to modulate PKC activity (28Epand R.M. Lester D.S. Trends Pharmacol.

Our results further suggest an additional specific effect of α-tocopherol on PKC, as α-tocopherol inhibited PKC activity much more strongly than did β-tocopherol (Fig. 6).Taken together these results suggest that the inhibition of PKC activity (i) is not directly due to the antioxidant capacity of α-tocopherol, (ii) requires the integration of α-tocopherol in a pseudo-membrane structure, and (iii) is due to an interaction between the α-tocopherol molecular structure and PKC. In addition, as α-tocopherol inhibited both PKC activity and superoxide production whereas β-tocopherol and Trolox did not (this report and Ref, 10), these data support a link between the effect of α-tocopherol on PKC activity and O⨪2 production.Vitamin E is a natural lipophilic antioxidant compound that protects lipid structures from peroxidation. It is the first antioxidant to be consumed during oxidative modification of LDL (31Esterbauer H. Fat Sci. Technol. 1989; 91: 316-324Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies and intervention trials have suggested a potential effect of vitamin E in the prevention of atherosclerosis (5Stephens N.G. Parsons A. Schofield P.M. Kelly F. Cheeseman K. Mitchinson M.J. Brown M.J. Lancet. 1996; 347: 781-786Abstract PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 32Gey K.F. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1995; 6: 206-236Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This beneficial role has been defined as the ability of vitamin E to increase LDL resistance to oxidation (6Princen H.M.G. van-Duyvenvoorde W. Buytenhek R. van-der-Laarse A. van-Poppel G. Gevers-Leuven J.A. van-Hinsbergh V.W.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Vitamin E may also protect LDL by attenuating the respiratory burst, as NADPH-oxidase activity and O⨪2 production by monocytes and macrophages are able to induce LDL oxidation (2Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Aviram M. Rosenblat M. Etzioni A. Levy R. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 1069-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Monocytes from volunteers taking oral vitamin E showed lower O⨪2 production together with an impaired capacity to oxidize LDL (8Devaraj S. Li D. Jialal I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Similarly, J774 macrophages supplemented in vitrowith vitamin E lost their power to oxidize LDL (35Suzukawa M. Abbey M. Clifton P. Nestel P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 110: 77-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Our results provide a model for a monocyte-mediated effect of vitamin E in preventing LDL oxidation; following PKC inhibition, p47phoxtranslocation and phosphorylation are inhibited, thereby decreasing superoxide production. As well as elucidating the way in which vitamin E delays and/or decreases oxygen-radical injury of LDL, this cellular model provides new insights into the potential beneficial effect of vitamin E on atherogenesis. Oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 appears to be a key event in the early stages of atherogenesis (1Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). Monocyte release of superoxide anion (O⨪2), a reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces LDL oxidation (2Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17508-17515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vitamin E (α-tocopherol), a lipophilic molecule present in plasma lipoproteins, is one of the most important natural antioxidants (3Liebler D.C. Burr J.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is able to scavenge acyl-peroxyl radicals in membrane structures and may prevent or delay cardiovascular diseases (4Janero D.R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 129-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 5Stephens N.G. Parsons A. Schofield P.M. Kelly F. Cheeseman K. Mitchinson M.J. Brown M.J. Lancet. 1996; 347: 781-786Abstract PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar), possibly through its capacity to increase LDL resistance to oxidative modification (6Princen H.M.G. van-Duyvenvoorde W. Buytenhek R. van-der-Laarse A. van-Poppel G. Gevers-Leuven J.A. van-Hinsbergh V.W.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The possibility that α-tocopherol has additional antioxidant effects by inhibiting ROS generation has received little attention. We (7Cachia O. Léger C.L. Descomps B.

Atherosclerosis. 1998; 138: 263-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), rat macrophages, and neutrophils (8Devaraj S. Li D. Jialal I. J. Clin.

Free Radical Res. 1995; 22: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the mechanism(s) underlying this inhibitory effect are unknown. The system responsible for O⨪2 production in phagocytic cells is the multicomponent enzyme NADPH-oxidase. This complex includes membrane-bound cytochrome b 558 and cytosolic proteins (p47phox, p67phox, Rac1/2, and p40phox) (11Chanock S.J. el Benna J. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that translocate to the membrane during stimulation to form a catalytically active oxidase (12DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). During NADPH-oxidase activation, p47phox is phosphorylated on several serine residues (13el Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in NADPH-oxidase activation and can phosphorylate p47phox (14Babior B.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,15el Benna J. Faust L.R.P. Johnson J.L. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). PKC is a family of Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases that play a pivotal role in agonist-stimulated cell functions (16Nishizuka Y. Cancer. 1989; 63: 1892-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Several PKC isoforms have been described (17Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). The conventional PKCs αPKC and βPKC are present in monocytes and are activated by phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (18Chang Z.L. Beezhold D.H. Immunology. 1993; 80: 360-366PubMed Google Scholar). In human monocytes and neutrophils, PMA induces the production of O⨪2 and the phosphorylation of several proteins, one of which is p47phox(14Babior B.M. Arch. Biochem.

This beneficial role has been defined as the ability of vitamin E to increase LDL resistance to oxidation (6Princen H.M.G. van-Duyvenvoorde W. Buytenhek R. van-der-Laarse A. van-Poppel G.

Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Vitamin E may also protect LDL by attenuating the respiratory burst, as NADPH-oxidase activity and O⨪2 production by monocytes and macrophages are able to induce LDL oxidation (2Li Q. Cathcart M.K.

Monocytes from volunteers taking oral vitamin E showed lower O⨪2 production together with an impaired capacity to oxidize LDL (8Devaraj S. Li D. Jialal I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Similarly, J774 macrophages supplemented in vitrowith vitamin E lost their power to oxidize LDL (35Suzukawa M. Abbey M. Clifton P. Nestel P.J. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 110: 77-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results provide a model for a monocyte-mediated effect of vitamin E in preventing LDL oxidation; following PKC inhibition, p47phoxtranslocation and phosphorylation are inhibited, thereby decreasing superoxide production. As well as elucidating the way in which vitamin E delays and/or decreases oxygen-radical injury of LDL, this cellular model provides new insights into the potential beneficial effect of vitamin E on atherogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2044374425,"We previously demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and H2O2differentially regulate interleukin-8 (IL-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) gene expression in endothelial and epithelial cells. H2O2 induced IL-8 expression in the A549 and BEAS-2B epithelial cell lines, but not in the human microvessel endothelial cell line, HMEC-1 or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In contrast, H2O2 induced ICAM-1 only in endothelial cells. Unlike H2O2, the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα induced IL-8 and ICAM-1 in both cell types. In this study, we examine the role of the redox-responsive transcription factors AP-1 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the differential expression of IL-8. DNA binding studies using nuclear protein extracts from HMEC-1 and A549 cells stimulated with H2O2 or TNFα demonstrated differential activation and promoter binding of AP-1 and NF-κB. H2O2 activated AP-1 but not NF-κB in A549, whereas TNFα activated AP-1 as well as NF-κB. In HMEC-1, TNFα activated NF-κB but not AP-1, while H2O2 did not activate either transcription factor. The differential activation of the factors was also reflected in their differential binding to the IL-8 promoter. Moreover, the H2O2 concentration dependent increase in epithelial IL-8 mRNA expression directly corresponded to the H2O2 concentration dependent binding of AP-1 to the IL-8 promoter. Supershift analysis revealed H2O2 as well as TNFα induced AP-1 complexes containing c-Fos and JunD. TNFα induced NF-κB complexes containing Rel A (p65). Immunohistochemical staining of HMEC-1 and A549 cells revealed TNFα stimulated nuclear localization of Rel A, whereas no translocation of Rel A was detected in either cell type stimulated by H2O2. These data indicate that the cell type-specific induction of IL-8 gene expression by H2O2 and TNFα in HMEC-1 and A549 cells can be explained by the differential binding of AP-1 and NF-κB to the IL-8 promoter."

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation in eucaryotes is a key mechanism for cellular control, because it is involved in several processes, such as cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). A fine balancing of cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation levels is determined by regulating the activities of protein-tyrosine kinases and/or protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs).1 Receptor protein-tyrosine kinases are considered to be the major enzymes regulating mitogenic protein phosphorylation cascades; nevertheless, the presence of SH2 domains in particular PTPs and the receptor-like structure of some membrane PTPs clearly indicate that PTPs are also regulated in the cell. The PTP superfamily consists of four main families: the tyrosine-specific phosphatases, the VH1-like dual specificity phosphatases, the cdc25 phosphatases, and the low molecular weight phosphatases (LMW-PTPs). Despite extremely limited sequence similarity, all share an active site motif consisting of a cysteine and an arginine separated by five residues (CXXXXXR, where X is any amino acid). All PTPs have identical catalytic mechanism, which involves the formation of a cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate (2Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Recent papers from our laboratory have demonstrated that LMW-PTP is involved in the regulation of cellular signaling started by the activation of PDGF and insulin receptors (3Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In fact, the overexpression of the wild type enzyme in NIH/3T3 cells causes decrease of cellular growth rate and of phosphorylation level of the PDGF receptor (3Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overexpression in NIH/3T3 cells of a dominant negative mutant (C12S), which is still able to bind substrates but is catalytically inactive, has opposite effect (6Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments (using anti-PDGF receptor, anti-insulin receptor, and anti-LMW-PTP antibodies) performed with cells overexpressing the dominant negative enzyme form have demonstrated that the enzyme associates with these receptors only when they are stimulated by their specific growth factors (5Chiarugi P.

Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies performed on the mitogenic transduction pathways starting from tyrosine kinase receptors demonstrated that LMW-PTP selectively interferes with the Src and the signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways in PDGF downstream signaling (4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the Src pathway in insulin downstream signaling (5Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the case of the latter receptor, we have also demonstrated that overexpression of the dominant negative and wild type LMW-PTPs influences glycogen synthesis rate (5Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other studies have also demonstrated that LMW-PTP was phosphorylatedin vitro by v-Src and by Lck kinases and that the phosphorylation caused a strong enhancement of its activity (7Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S.

Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) found that LMW-PTP is phosphorylated in resting T cells and that the protein rapidly loses its phosphotyrosine on stimulation of these cells. All of these findings indicate that there are complex relationships, still not adequately understood, among LMW-PTP, protein-tyrosine kinase receptors, and Src kinases. Very recently, the recruitment of LMW-PTP by ephrin-tyrosine kinase receptors has been demonstrated (9Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1988; 12: 667-678Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This paper deals with the mechanism of LMW-PTP inactivation by hydrogen peroxide, a compound endogenously produced in the cell. Significant enzyme inactivation levels are determined by physiological concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, such as those produced during oxidative stress conditions or during signaling processes initiated by a variety of ligands including cytokines, peptide growth factors acting through tyrosine kinase, and G-protein-coupled receptors (10Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). This suggests that H2O2 regulates LMW-PTP activityin vivo. Human recombinant LMW-PTPs (IF1 and IF2 isoenzymes) were prepared as described previously (11Marzocchini M. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Taddei N. Thunnissen M.G.M.M. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Iodo[14C]acetate was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Trypsin was purchased from Sigma. The HPLC separations were performed by a reverse-phase C4-column, 4.5 × 75 mm, 5 μm, Altex ULTRAPORE RPSC, or with a reverse-phase column, 4.5 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Vydac Peptide and Protein C18. All other reagents were the purest commercially available. Protein concentration was assayed by the BCA kit, purchased from Sigma. PTP activity was assayed as described previously, using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate at pH 5.3 and 37 °C (12Caselli A. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pazzagli L. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24878-24882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate per min under the described conditions. The experimental data were fitted with the kinetic equations using the Fig.P program (Biosoft). All initial rate measurements were carried out at least in triplicate. Stock solutions of H2O2 were titrated before use, using a standard solution of KMnO4. The modification reactions were performed at 25 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The incubation mixture (300 μl) contained 10 μg of LMW-PTP (IF1 or IF2 isoform) and varying H2O2concentrations (0.01–0.25 mm). Aliquots were withdrawn at different time intervals, and the residual activity was immediately assayed. In protection experiments with inorganic phosphate, a well known LMW-PTP inhibitor, the ligand was added prior to the addition of the H2O2 stock solution. Free thiol groups were titrated by 5-(octyldithio)-2-nitrobenzoate as described by Faulstichet al. (13Faulstich H. Tews P. Heintz D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This reagent is able to react with protein thiol groups faster than Ellman reagent, because it contains a lipophilic carbon chain and no negative charges. The reagent easily diffuses in the protein core and thus it rapidly reacts with all protein thiols. Free thiols were titrated both before and after 90% of the enzyme was inactivated by H2O2. The modified and radiolabeled enzyme (see below) was dissolved in 50 μl of 0.2m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, containing 6 mguanidinium chloride; then, 250 μl of 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, was added in order to adjust the concentration of guanidinium chloride to 1 m. This solution was incubated for 4 min in a boiling water bath and then chilled in ice. The trypsin digestion was initiated by adding a small volume of trypsin solution (final concentration, 5%, w/w). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min, and peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC using the Vydac C18 column. HPLC was using an Altex ULTRAPORE RPSC column (4.5 × 75 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min (solvent A, 10 mm trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 10 mm trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The elution gradient was as follows: 0–20 min, 10–50% solvent B. The column flux was continuously introduced into the electrospray source of the mass spectrometer, and mass spectra were acquired. Electrospray mass spectra were acquired on a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA) 1100 MSD mass spectrometer. The electrospray mass spectra of LMW-PTPs were obtained under the following conditions: electrospray capillary voltage, 4 kV; fragmentor voltage, 120 V; nebulizer gas (N2), 40 psi; drying gas (N2), 10 liters/min at 300 °C; scan range, 500–2000 m/z; scan rate, 3 ms/atomic mass unit; resolution, >1 atomic mass unit. Incubation of both IF1 and IF2 isoforms of LMW-PTP with H2O2 at pH 7.5 and 25 °C resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of enzymatic activity (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). These figures show that in the range 0.01–0.25 mm H2O2 concentrations, the inactivation reactions obey apparent first-order kinetics. The apparent first-order inactivation constants (k obs) can be calculated by plotting the ln of percent residual activityversus time and fitting a linear equation. The replots of k obs as a function of H2O2 concentration (Fig. 1, A and B, insets) gave straight lines, indicating that the inactivation of LMW-PTP by H2O2 is a bimolecular process. The calculated second-order rate constants for the H2O2 inactivation of IF1 and IF2 LMW-PTP isoforms are 13.1 ± 0.2 and 18.3 ± 0.5m−1 s−1, respectively. Similar experiments were performed in the presence of 2 mm EDTA and gave the following second-order rate constants values: IF1 = 10.9 ± 0.4 m−1 s−1, IF2 = 13.2 ± 0.6 m−1s−1. Inorganic phosphate, which is a competitive inhibitor of LMW-PTP, was tested in order to determine whether or not it protects the enzyme from inactivation. Fig. 2 shows that Pi protects both LMW-PTP isoforms from H2O2 inactivation, suggesting that the reaction is directed at the active site. The inactivation was completely reverted by thiol compounds. In fact, Fig. 2 also shows that when the inactivated isoenzymes were treated with an excess of dithiothreitol, they rapidly recovered their activity. TableI shows the titration data of free thiols performed on untreated and H2O2-inactivated IF1 and IF2 isoenzymes. Both untreated IF1 and IF2 LMW-PTPs contain 8 free thiols per enzyme molecule, whereas each H2O2-inactivated isoform contains only about 6 free thiols per enzyme molecule. These findings indicate that H2O2 inactivates LMW-PTPs through the oxidation of two cysteine residues.Table IStoichiometry of LMW-PTP modification by H2O2LMW-PTPFree thiol groups1-aDetermined spectrophotometrically (13).IF18.2 (8)H2O2-modified IF16.1IF27.9 (8)H2O2-modified IF25.81-a Determined spectrophotometrically (13Faulstich H.

Open table in a new tab These analyses were performed in order to reveal the type of chemical modification of LMW-PTPs caused by H2O2. The left panels of Fig. 3 show the HPLC time-course analyses carried out during LMW-PTP (IF1 isoenzyme) inactivation. It can be seen that the decrease in enzyme activity due to the H2O2 reaction is accompanied by formation and increase of a new protein peak (peak II) having a retention time lower than that of the untreated enzyme (peak I). Fig. 4, A and C, shows the electrospray mass spectra of peaks I and II, respectively. Fig. 4,B and D, reports the charge distribution of a number of peaks selected by the computer deconvolution program to calculate the protein masses from A and C spectra (Fig. 4, Band D, insets). It can be seen that the H2O2-inactivated IF1-LMW-PTP (peak II; Fig. 3,left panels) has a molecular mass of 18,081 Da, which is 2 units lower than that of the untreated enzyme (molecular mass, 18,083 Da). These findings, as well as the titration of free thiols remaining in the enzyme molecule after inactivation, indicate that H2O2 induced the formation of a single disulfide bridge in the enzyme molecule, which contains eight cysteine residues. Identical conclusions can be drawn from the results found for the IF2-LMW-PTP isoform (Fig. 3, right panels). In this case, the electrospray mass spectra of peaks I and II gave the following results: mass of peak I, 17,990 Da; mass of peak II, 17,988 Da.Figure 4Electrospray mass spectra of the unmodified and H2O2-modified enzymes.

At the level of 10% residual activity, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 volumes of cold ethanol to precipitate the H2O2-modified enzyme. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 25,300 × g, washed with cold ethanol, collected again by centrifugation, and newly dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.7, containing 6m guanidinium chloride and 0.645 m iodoacetate to derivatize all free thiol groups. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The oxidized and carboxymethylated enzyme was purified from reagents by reverse phase HPLC on the ULTRAPORE RPSC column. This Cm enzyme (20 nmol) was dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 6 mguanidinium chloride and treated with 5 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was incubated overnight at 40 °C in order to reduce S—S bonds formed during the H2O2 enzyme inactivation and then treated with 0.645 miodo[14C]acetate (specific radioactivity, 0.85 μCi/μmol) to label all cysteines oxidized by H2O2 during enzyme inactivation. After 15 min at room temperature, the mixture was treated with 5 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol, and the labeled protein was purified from reagents by reverse phase HPLC (C4-column) as described above. The enzyme peak was dried by a Savant vacuum evaporator, dissolved in 6 mguanidinium chloride, and purified again by reverse phase HPLC (C4-column) in order to completely eliminate low molecular weight radioactive compounds. The 14C-labeled protein was digested with trypsin, and tryptic peptides were separated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 shows the HPLC separation of tryptic peptides performed with the Vydac C18 column. All peaks were collected manually, and 14C radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. We found that only three tryptic fragments (T3, T25, and T37) were consistently labeled by iodo[14C]acetate. Most of radioactivity was associated with T25 and T37: both peaks were rechromatographed at different conditions using a Vydac C18-column and the following solvents: 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). The amino acid analyses of T3, T25, and T37 are reported in Table II; T3 is identified as the CCR150 tryptic peptide, whereas T37 is identified as the SVLFVCLGNICR18 tryptic peptide (the underlined characters indicate the conserved active site motif of PTPs). Furthermore, the amino acid composition of T25 enabled us to identify it as the fragment VCLGNICR18, originating from an unexpected subfragmentation of T37 (all sequence positions refer to the natural human IF1 LMW-PTP isoform; the recombinant enzyme contains two additional N-terminal residues (Gly-Ser)). We measured the specific radioactivity of all labeled peaks. Table II shows the results: it can be seen that the stoichiometry of iodoacetate incorporation into T25 is 2.2 Cm groups/mol of peptide (near integer = 2), whereas into T37 it is 1.9 (near integer = 2) Cm groups/mol of peptide. These findings demonstrate that both Cys-12 and Cys-17 were completely derivatized with iodo[14C]acetate. On the other hand, the stoichiometry of modification of T3 by iodo[14C]acetate is 0.25 mol of Cm groups per mol of peptide; because T3 contains 2 Cys residues per mol of peptide, this value suggests that only a fraction of one or both Cys residues was derivatized by iodo[14C]acetate.Table IIIdentification of the cysteine residues oxidized by H2O2: amino acid analysis and characterization of14C-labeled peptidesT3T25T37Cm-Cys1.91.81.6Asp1.01.1Ser1.1Gly1.11.2Val0.91.9Ile1.01.0Leu1.01.8Phe1.1Arg1.01.01.0SequenceCCRVCLGNICRSVLFVCLGNICRSequence position2-aNatural human IF1 LMW-PTP isoform; the recombinant enzyme contains two N-terminal additional residues (Gly-Ser).148–15011–18 7–18Total radioactivity (dpm)2-bdpm, disintegrations/min.75401575025374Specific radioactivity (dpm/nmol of peptide)48442873578Molar ratios [14C]Cm/peptide0.252.201.90 [14C]Cm/Cys residue0.131.100.95The H2O2-modified enzyme was treated with iodoacetate to derivatize the unreacted cysteines.

Open table in a new tab The H2O2-modified enzyme was treated with iodoacetate to derivatize the unreacted cysteines. Then, the purified protein was reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the produced protein thiols were labeled by iodo[14C]acetate. Analyses were performed on HPLC-purified peptides. Amino acid analyses are expressed as molar ratios. All of these findings, together with those obtained with the HPLC electrospray mass spectrometry analyses, demonstrate that the mechanism of H2O2 inactivation of LMW-PTP involves the formation of a disulfide bridge between Cys-12 and Cys-17, both contained in the enzyme active site. The rather good separation between the H2O2-inactivated and active enzymes observed in the reverse phase HPLC analyses (Fig. 3) suggested to us that the formation of the disulfide bridge between Cys-12 and Cys-17 is accompanied (or determined) by an enzyme conformational change. In fact, the partition of proteins between the two chromatography phases depends on the protein surface properties. The hypothesis of fold modifications during H2O2 inactivation agrees with the x-ray crystal structure of LMW-PTP. Whereas the Cys-12 –SH group is localized at the bottom of the active site cavity (where the phosphate moiety of the substrate establishes the main interactions), the –SH group of Cys-17 is localized at a distance of about 7 Å from the Cys-12 –SH group (Fig. 6). The formation of an S—S bridge requires that the two thiol groups move from their original positions and approach each other. Thus, we performed fluorescence spectroscopy experiments to test this hypothesis. Fig. 7 A shows that the decrease of IF1 activity caused by H2O2 is accompanied by a red-shift of the fluorescence emission λmax, whereas the quantum yield does not greatly change (the excitation wavelength was 280 nm). On the contrary, similar experiments performed with IF2 gave different results. Fig. 7 C shows that the H2O2 inactivation of IF2 isoenzyme causes a blue-shift of the fluorescence emission λmax and a fairly strong decrease of the fluorescence quantum yield. We also compared the spectra of H2O2-inactivated LMW-PTPs with those of the thermally denatured forms. Fig. 7, B and D, shows representative fluorescence emission spectra of the untreated and thermally denatured IF1 and IF2. It can be seen that the reduction of fluorescence quantum yields of both denatured proteins is stronger than that observed for H2O2-inactivated enzymes. Furthermore, both denatured proteins show red-shifts of the fluorescence emission maximum, indicating an exposure of Trp residues to a more polar environment. Considering H2O2 inactivation, we can note that the stronger effects on fluorescence properties observed for the IF2 isoform with respect to those of IF1 could be justified taking into account that IF2 contains two Trp residues (Trp-39 and Trp-49), whereas IF1 contains Trp-39 only. Trp-49 is localized in a long loop near the active site pocket and exposed to the solvent, whereas Trp-39 is inserted into the main hydrophobic protein core (Fig. 6). We suggest that the strong decrease in the fluorescence emission quantum yield of the H2O2-inactivated IF2 is due to a change in the local environment of the loop containing Trp-49, with little modification of the main protein fold. This agrees with the small fluorescence differences between the untreated and H2O2-inactivated IF1, which does not contain Trp residues in this loop. All of these findings indicate that H2O2 oxidation of LMW-PTPs causes changes in the arrangement of secondary structures of the enzyme core that are limited but sufficient to favor the formation of the disulfide bridge between Cys-12 and Cys-17. We have also measured the kinetics of fluorescence modifications during H2O2inactivation of both IF1 and IF2. The data fit well with first-order kinetics; in Table III, the calculatedk obs values for the fluorescence signal reduction are compared with those calculated from H2O2 inactivation experiments. Thek obs values for both IF1 and IF2 inactivation are higher than those calculated for the fluorescence signal reduction, demonstrating that the inactivation precedes the conformational change. These findings also suggest that the inactivation is due to the reaction of H2O2 with one of the two cysteines contained in the active site region, producing a reactive intermediate, which successively reacts with the proximal cysteine forming the disulfide bond.Table IIIKinetic analysis of inactivation and of conformational change of LMW-PTPInactivation k obsConformational change,3-aThe kinetics of conformational change was determined by recording the fluorescence decrease at λmax during the experimental time.

Open table in a new tab Several important cellular processes are regulated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The activation of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors transiently enhances cellular protein phosphorylation, which is rapidly reverted by the action of potent cellular PTPs, both membrane-bound and soluble enzymes (2Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the high number of PTPs codified in the eucaryotic genome suggests that the regulation of cellular protein phosphorylation levels does not depend exclusively on the regulation of protein-tyrosine kinases, but also on the regulation of certain PTPs. LMW-PTPs do not have general sequence homology with other PTPs but share the common active site motif CXXXXXR (C and R are essential catalytic residues) and also have the same catalytic mechanism (2Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Whereas many enzymes in the other PTP families possess regulatory or targeting domains, LMW-PTP is composed of a catalytic domain alone. Two LMW-PTP isoforms, produced from a single gene through alternative splicing, are expressed in mammalian cells. Recently, LMW-PTP has been implicated in the regulation of cell signaling started by the activation of PDGF and insulin receptors (3Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 238: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Its activity seems to be regulated by the phosphorylation of Tyr-131 and Tyr-132 by Src family kinases (7Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,8Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Some years ago, we proposed that PTPs may be regulated by the transient chemical modification of the essential cysteine contained in the active site. In fact, we observed that nitric oxide reacts in vitrowith the PTP essential cysteine, forming an S-nitrosothiol derivative (12Caselli A. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pazzagli L. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24878-24882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of LMW-PTP, the presence of an additional proximal cysteine within the active site loop determines the formation of a disulfide bond. The reduction of the modified protein with low molecular weight thiols rapidly restores the enzyme activity. Additional experiments performed with macrophages (RAW 264.6 line), stimulated by a bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ to produce NO in the cell, demonstrated a strong decrease of both membrane-bound and soluble PTP activities, suggesting that nitric oxide really regulates PTPs in vivo (14Caselli A. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results described in this paper reveal an additional mechanism for the regulation of LMW-PTP activity: hydrogen peroxide, produced during cellular oxidative stress conditions and during mitogenic signaling starting from a number of membrane receptors (15Suzuki Y.J. Forman H.J. Sevanian A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), inactivates both LMW-PTP isoenzymes at physiological concentration levels. The inactivation, which is reverted by low molecular weight thiols, is caused by the specific oxidation of both active site loop Cys-12 and Cys-17, which form a disulfide bond. Only these two cysteines out of eight contained in the enzyme (all are in the −SH form (16Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Modesti A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2560-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) show high reactivity versus hydrogen peroxide. Probably, the presence of two vicinal thiol groups in the active site region favors the formation of the observed disulfide bridge. A similar event has been previously observed in the mechanism of LMW-PTP inactivation by nitric oxide (12Caselli A. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pazzagli L. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24878-24882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, Finkel (10Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) observed that there is a potential analogy between nitric oxide and other ROS produced in the cell. In both cases, high levels of these reactive compounds are produced by immune effector cells, whereas lower amounts are used by other cell types for signal transduction. We consider it very interesting that both nitric oxide and H2O2inactivate PTP modifying a unique molecular target, i.e. the essential active site cysteine thiol. Searching the main sequence data banks (GenBank, SWISS-PROT, EMBL, PIR), we have noted that LMW-PTP is the sole PTP containing two cysteine residues within the conserved active site motif (CXXXXXR), which is strictly conserved in all members of the large PTP family. In all prokaryotic and eucaryotic organisms, both LMW-PTP Cys-12 and Cys-17 are conserved, indicating that these two vicinal thiols are involved in some peculiar cellular functions or regulations. With respect to the mechanism of LMW-PTP inactivation by H2O2, we considered two possibilities. Taking into account that H2O2 has moderate reactivity, it could act to generate more reactive species, such as the hydroxyl radical produced in vitro by metal-dependent breakdown of H2O2 (17Halliwell B. Gutteridge M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar) (trace metal may be present in the buffer). Alternatively, considering that the catalytic Cys-12 of LMW-PTPs has a remarkably low pK a (18Peters G.H. Frimurer T.M. Olsen O.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5383-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and therefore it is in the thiolate form at physiological pH values, we would expect that it reacts with H2O2 by a nucleophilic displacement reaction forming a cysteine sulfenic acid; this mechanism was suggested for the catalytic pathways of a number of enzymes in which a catalytic thiolate ion reacts with hydroperoxides (19Poole L.B. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12330-12338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Miller H. Claiborne A J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19342-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Yeh J.I. Claiborne A. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed LMW-PTP inactivation experiments by H2O2 both in the absence and in the presence of 2 mm EDTA. We found that the addition of this metal chelator to the reaction mixtures causes 17 and 28% decreases of the second-order rate constants for H2O2inactivation of IF1 and IF2 LMW-PTP isoforms, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the observed inactivation is mainly due to a direct action of H2O2 on the isoenzymes, although the hydroxyl radical also contributes to inactivation. Denu and Tanner (23Denu J.M. Tanner K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) have recently reported that some PTPs are inactivated by H2O2 and that the inactivation is due to the oxidation of the –SH group of the catalytic cysteine, producing a sulfenic acid. Although our H2O2inactivation experiments, performed with LMW-PTPs using HPLC-mass spectrometry analyses, do not reveal the formation of any sulfenic acid functions, we do not exclude that this is formed as a transient intermediate in the pathway that leads to the production of the disulfide bond found in H2O2-treated LMW-PTPs. The involvement of physiological low molecular weight thiols and thioredoxin in the transient modification of the enzyme active sitein vivo cannot be ruled out. Thomas et al. (24Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) proposed that cellular proteins react with metabolically generated oxidative compounds forming reactive sulfhydryl intermediates, such as thiyl radicals or sulfenic acids. These modifications may be reverted by the rapid reaction with glutathione, forming S-thiolate derivatives, followed by reductive processes that include direct reduction by glutathione or, more likely, by dithiol redox proteins, such as thioredoxin or glutaredoxin. A growing body of evidence has indicated that cellular redox status modulates various functions in normal and pathological conditions. Oxidative stress has been implicated in a wide range of disease states and degenerative processes, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory states, and aging (25Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989: 416-508Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of ROS insult to cells is not yet well defined. The transient rise in ROS observed following ligand activation of a number of membrane receptors (15Suzuki Y.J. Forman H.J. Sevanian A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar) is actually considered very important for signaling processes. In fact, the transient increase in ROS has been observed in vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated by PDGF (26Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar) and in A431 cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (27Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Thee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Lee et al. (28Lee S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Kim S.-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) found that PTP 1B is transiently inactivated after stimulation of A431 cells with epidermal growth factor and suggested that this action, which is concurrent with that performed by the epidermal growth factor-receptor tyrosine kinase, contributes to determining the steady-state level of protein phosphorylation necessary for growth stimulation. The activation of transcription factor nuclear factor κB, which is stimulated by a host of ligands, is blocked by antioxidant treatment (29Schreck R. Rieber R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar), indicating that ROS are implicated in such signaling processes. Very interesting is the work of Schreck et al. (29Schreck R. Rieber R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar, 30Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar); they reported that hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides, but not the superoxide anion, activate nuclear factor κB in some cell lines. We think that our findings on the reversible H2O2 inactivation of LMW-PTP, an enzyme involved in the regulation of some signaling pathways starting from tyrosine kinase receptors, may contribute to understanding the mechanisms of some ROS cellular actions. We thank Dr. N. Taddei and Dr. P. Paoli for assistance and discussion in fluorescence spectroscopy experiments."

Old Yellow Enzyme Old Yellow Enzyme isoform 1 coupled gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde. Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE1; EC 1.6.99.1), revealed as the first protein requiring the use of an FMN prosthetic group by Theorell (1Theorell H. Biochem. Z. 1935; 266: 377-411Google Scholar), opened a new chapter in the history of enzymology by unveiling the significance of small organic molecules in catalysis. Despite the enzyme's antiquity, the physiological function of OYE has persisted as an unsolved question. OYE, originally isolated from brewer's bottom yeast (2Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1933; 266: 377-411Google Scholar), has been shown to be a heterogeneous mixture consisting of several isoforms (3Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme exists as a dimer of 49-kDa subunits containing one non-covalently bound FMN per subunit (4Matthews R.G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1779-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene for the isoform OYE1 from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis has been cloned (5Saito K. Thiele D.J. Davio M. Lockridge O. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20720-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), providing the opportunity to apply molecular biology techniques to probe enzyme function. In addition, a crystal structure of OYE1 has been solved at a resolution of 2.0 Å, revealing several residues likely involved in catalysis and ligand binding (6Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 234: 502-507Google Scholar, 7Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Karplus P.A. Fox K.M. Massey V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1518-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The structure supports the long established fact that NADPH serves as the physiological reductant for the enzyme and provides insight into the nature of potential oxidants. Although molecular oxygen serves as a substrate for the oxidative half-reaction, the slow rate and biochemical non-productivity of such a reaction make it unlikely to be the physiological oxidant. Work in this laboratory has revealed that quinones and, more recently, many α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones serve as efficient substrates for the oxidation of OYE, in which the olefinic bond is reduced (3Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vaz A.D.N. Massey V. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 949AGoogle Scholar). OYE is characterized by its ability to form deeply colored long wavelength charge-transfer complexes on binding a wide variety of phenolic compounds (4Matthews R.G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1779-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Matthews R.G. Massey V. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9294-9298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These phenolic ligands, as well as the substrates for the oxidative and reductive half reactions, share a common binding site (12Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the si-face of the flavin. The charge-transfer absorption has been attributed to stacking interactions observed in the crystal structure at the flavin-ligand interface between the π systems of oxidized FMN and the representative ligandp-hydroxybenzaldehyde (7Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 11Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When similar long wavelength absorption was observed upon equilibration with a variety of cyclic enones, most notably with 2-cyclohexenone, these were originally attributed to analogous charge-transfer complexes (3Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Massey V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1993. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1994: 371-380Crossref Google Scholar). Further investigation revealed a novel dismutation reaction occurring whereby oxidation of the cyclic enone led to aromatization via a stereospecifictrans dehydrogenation (14Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Several α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones were shown to be efficient substrates for the turnover reaction with NADPH (Fig. 1). Studies withR-[2H]NADPH and D2O have established that the reduction of cinnamaldehyde, a representative α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, proceeds via stereospecific transfer of hydride to the carbon β to the carbonyl and uptake of a solvent-derived proton at the α position (14Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure reveals that Tyr-196 is ideally suited to serve as an active-site acid in the reduction of an enone, as it is primed to deliver a proton to the α position (8Karplus P.A. Fox K.M. Massey V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1518-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Studies with the MurBEscherichia coli enzyme, which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the vinyllic bond of enoyl-pyruvyl-UDP-GlcNAc in cell wall biosynthesis, have revealed a catalytically significant serine residue homologous to Tyr-196 in OYE (15Benson T.E. Walsh C.T. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In an effort to characterize the mechanism of reduction of the enone, a tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y196F) mutation of OYE1 was constructed. The reduction of the substrate double bond is demonstrated to consists of two phases, hydride transfer and proton uptake, which are coupled to varying degrees depending on the identity of the substrate. Kinetic characterization of the mutation with a variety of substrates reveals the role of Tyr-196 in the protonation reaction. In addition, Y196F OYE1 is used to probe the manner in which the enzyme primes the substrate for the oxidative half-reaction in the Michaelis complex. The Old Yellow Enzyme demonstrates that it has much new information to reveal regarding the nature of catalysis of redox reactions. OYE1 cloned in the pET expression system as described previously (5Saito K. Thiele D.J. Davio M. Lockridge O. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20720-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in conducting a novel method for polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis (16Kohli R.M. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). By substituting a silent mutation introducing a restriction site, two overlapping polymerase chain reaction fragments containing the desired mutation are fused and mutant fragment subcloned into the wild type vector. The generation of the mutation is confirmed by screening digestion for the incorporation of a CfoI restriction site encoded by the introduction of a silent mutation in the mutagenic primer and by sequencing by automated fluorescent sequencing carried out by the University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facility.E. coli strain BL21-DE3 harboring the Y196F OYE1-pET plasmid was used to express mutant OYE1 by induction with 400 μmIPTG 8 h after 1% inoculation of 10 L of LB/Amp. The cells were harvested 8 h after induction. Purification of the mutant enzyme was carried out as described previously (17Niino Y.S. Chakraborty S. Brown B.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1983-1991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all studies with Y196F OYE1 were conducted at pH 7.0 and 25 °C in the presence of 0.1 m potassium Pi. Titrations by various ligands of OYE were recorded by following absorbance changes with a Varian Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Titrations were conducted by addition of small volumes of concentrated ligand to oxidized enzyme in 1-ml quartz cuvettes. Dissociation constants were determined by assessing from the amount of spectral perturbation the relative amounts of boundversus unbound ligand relative to unbound enzyme. Turnover assays were conducted with NADPH as the substrate for the reductive half-reaction and various substrates for the oxidative half-reaction. The standard assay was conducted in 1 ml with 100 μm NADPH, 1 mm substrate for the oxidative half-reaction, and 10 nm enzyme. Aerobic turnover reactions were conducted at air saturation (256 μm) of O2. Turnover numbers, reported as moles of pyridine nucleotide oxidized per molecule of FMN per minute, were determined by following the rate of change in absorbance at 340 nm as a function of [NADPH] and extrapolating to a theoretical maximum for [NADPH] by fitting a double-reciprocal plot. The reaction product was extracted into dichloromethane and concentrated. The products of the turnover reaction were analyzed by GC/MS using instrumentation described previously (14Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The reductive half-reaction with NADPH and the oxidative half-reaction with various substrates were studied using a Kinetic Instruments stopped flow spectrophotometer with tungsten lamp, monochrometer, and photomultiplier for absorbance detection as described previously (19Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4611-4618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The system was made anaerobic by incubation overnight with an anaerobic solution of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase. All buffer and substrate solutions were made anaerobic by bubbling argon through the solution for at least 15 min before use. For the oxidative half-reaction with oxygen, solutions of various concentrations of oxygen were made up by equilibrating 0.1m potassium Pi solutions by bubbling with the desired concentration of oxygen. Enzyme solutions were made anaerobic in a tonometer by alternately applying a vacuum and purging with argon. For studies of the oxidative half-reaction, reduced enzyme was generated by addition of an NADPH-generating system containing 4 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 40 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.03 μm NADP+, from a sidearm after the tonometer had been made anaerobic. Analysis was conducted by fitting data to exponential equations using the Marquardt algorithm (20Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969Google Scholar) with Program A, developed by C.-J. Chiu, R. Chung, J. Diverno and D. P. Ballou at the University of Michigan. The slow oxidative half-reaction with 2-cyclohexenone was studied with the Varian Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer by taking enzyme in an anaerobic cuvette with slightly less than a stoichiometric equivalent of NADPH in one sidearm and varying concentration of 2-cyclohexenone in the second sidearm. After making the cuvette anaerobic, the enzyme was first reduced by addition of the contents of the NADPH sidearm. After a stable reduced enzyme spectrum appeared, reoxidation was subsequently followed for up to 6 h after addition of 2-cyclohexenone. The rate of reoxidation was determined by fitting a single exponential to the appearance of absorbance at 462 nm marking the regeneration of oxidized flavin. The complex of 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde bound to Y196F OYE1 was observed using a High-Tech Scientific SF-61 stopped flow spectrofluorimeter apparatus with a diode array spectrophotometer. Purification of Y196F OYE1 was conducted by affinity chromatography withN-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)aminohexyl-agarose (18Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The successful isolation of the Y196F noted by the generation of a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggests that ligand binding interaction with the p-hydroxybenzaldehyde analog remains tight with the mutant enzyme. The expression and purification system generated Y196F OYE1 in a yield of 26 mg/liter of culture. The spectrum of Y196F has a wavelength maximum identical to that of the wild type enzyme at 462 nm (Fig. 2) and an extinction determined as described previously (21Brown B.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) of ε462 = 10,700 m−1cm−1. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we seek to specifically isolate and alter the residue Tyr-196 while leaving other aspects of the system unchanged. The concern regarding undesired structural rearrangements was allayed through several lines of evidence. The interaction of Y196F with a series of phenolic ligands provides ample data regarding the nature of the FMN and conformation of the active site. Ligand binding as measured by K d is seen to be alternately unaffected, as with p-chlorophenol, or moderately enhanced, as with p-fluorophenol. Upon binding to these phenolic compounds, the long wavelength absorption of the bound complex has been attributed to formation of a charge-transfer complex (11Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5327-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The perturbation of the oxidized enzyme spectrum upon addition of ligand looks much like that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 2). However, with Y196F OYE1, across the series of bound ligands, the λmax of the charge-transfer complex is seen to be modestly blue-shifted (Table I). In earlier studies, by replacement of FMN with a series of artificial flavins, the energy of the long-wavelength transitions was shown to correlate with the oxidation-reduction potential of the flavin. A plot of the reported redox potential of the free artificial flavins and the location of the charge-transfer maxima of thep-chlorophenol bound to enzyme demonstrates a linear relationship, which correlates with a modest reduction in flavin potential for Y196F of approximately 10–15 mV (11Abramovitz A.S.

Open table in a new tab Initial efforts to characterize the kinetic parameters of the reaction of Y196F were attempted though analysis of the aerobic steady state turnover assays with NADPH. Assays of the wild type enzyme, conducted by following oxidation of NADPH at saturating conditions and air saturation of oxygen, typically give turnover rates that accelerate from 51 min−1 to over 220 min−1 upon the addition of 1 mm2-cyclohexenone (3Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When a similar assay was conducted with Y196F, the rate of turnover decreased from an initial rate of 60 min−1 with NADPH/O2 to a rate of 2 min−1 upon the addition of 1 mm2-cyclohexenone. The products of the turnover reaction were analyzed by GC/MS and showed no detectable cyclohexanone. In the turnover scheme, apparently 2-cyclohexenone is no longer the oxidant of choice for Y196F. When the turnover was observed anaerobically with 2-cyclohexenone as the only substrate for the oxidative half-reaction, we observed a nearly complete loss of catalysis. These results also signal a significant departure from data obtained with residues proposed to be involved in ligand binding (21Brown B.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the case of mutation of the His-191 and Asn-194 residues, upon addition of the enone substrate, aerobic turnover was unchanged by the mutation as the enzyme fails to bind the enone well and O2 reactivity is unaffected. For Y196F, inhibition of the normal turnover was observed in the presence of the substrate. Several possibilities exist to explain such a marked reduction in turnover in the presence of 2-cyclohexenone. To examine the full kinetics of the turnover and to determine the effect of Y196F on catalysis, we studied the individual half-reactions. Given our hypothesis regarding the role of Tyr-196 as an active-site acid, reductive half-reaction kinetics are expected to be unaffected in Y196F as transfer of the 4-pro-R hydridic hydrogen of NADPH to oxidized flavin proceeds without a mechanistic need for a proton donor or acceptor. As demonstrated in Scheme FS1, the reductive half-reaction, examined by stopped-flow, demonstrates no appreciable changes in the observable mechanistic steps. Typically, after a dead-time binding event, charge-transfer complex formation between oxidized enzyme and reduced pyridine nucleotide, followed by flavin reduction and product release, is observed (17Niino Y.S. Chakraborty S. Brown B.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1983-1991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The rates for the binding event and charge-transfer formation remain largely unchanged as determined from the fitting of absorbance data at varied concentrations of NADPH. The charge-transfer intermediate Y196F OYE1:NADPH* complex is apparent from the transitory appearance of long-wavelength absorption in the course of the reaction. As with the wild type enzyme, k red shows minimal concentration dependence on NADPH for Y196F and the reduction rate constant of 5.4 s−1 does not differ significantly from the reported wild type value of 5.1 s−1 (21Brown B.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Given that kinetics of the reductive half-reaction were not responsible for the dramatic change in rates with the aerobic turnover in the presence of 2-cyclohexenone, we turned our attention toward the oxidative half-reaction. The oxidative half-reaction with 2-cyclohexenone proved to be amenable to study by monitoring the absorbance at 462 nm, corresponding to the slow appearance of oxidized enzyme, after mixing various concentrations of substrate with reduced enzyme in an anaerobic cuvette. The reduced enzyme shows minimal absorbance in the region of oxidized enzyme. Upon mixing with 2-cyclohexenone, there is an immediate increase in absorbance with a maximum of 455 nm (Fig. 3). The initial burst in absorbance is followed by the very slow generation of a final spectrum, which is that of oxidized OYE bound to 2-cyclohexenone. The spectrum initially formed upon mixing seems deceptively like the oxidized enzyme spectrum. However, a closer examination reveals that the sharp flavin peak is replaced instead by a broader absorbance spectrum reminiscent of the charge-transfer complexes seen with oxidized enzyme and phenolic compounds. The spectrum initially observed after mixing is tentatively assigned to the formation of a complex between reduced enzyme and 2-cyclohexenone. The rate of oxidation was measured by monitoring the disappearance of the reduced enzyme complex and the appearance of the spectrum of oxidized enzyme bound to substrate. Wild type enzyme in the presence of 2-cyclohexenone typically undergoes a dismutation reaction whereby oxidized enzyme oxidizes 2-cyclohexenone to phenol, which successively forms a long-wavelength absorbing charge-transfer complex (14Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The lack of the appearance of such a long-wavelength species even after following the oxidation over the period of many hours suggests that the dismutation reaction occurs at an undetectable rate with Y196F OYE1. This is consistent with the concept that oxidation of the 2-cyclohexenone would require Tyr-196 to act as an active site base and deprotonate the non-vinyllic α-carbon to the carbonyl. The oxidation of enzyme-bound reduced flavin was examined at a series of concentrations of substrate to assess the complete kinetics of the oxidative half-reaction. At all concentrations, the oxidation is seen to fit a single exponential, which represents the slow oxidation rate. The k obs includes the typically rapid rate of product dissociation and binding of oxidized enzyme to excess substrate. Ligand binding and dissociation typically occur on the millisecond time scale and thus do not affect the observed rate. A double-reciprocal plot of the data gives an oxidation rate constant of (1.4 ± 0.2) × 10−2 min−1 which represents nearly 6 orders of magnitude decrease in the oxidation rate constant of wild type enzyme with 2-cyclohexenone (21Brown B.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The individual data points show significant scatter, which allow only an approximate estimate of the enzyme affinity for substrate in the low micromolar range. The reaction with molecular oxygen as a substrate for the oxidative half-reaction was studied by rapid reaction methods and the results are presented in Fig. 4. The reaction is second order with respect to O2 concentration. The k oxvalue obtained for O2 is double that of the wild type enzyme (Table II). Given the slowing in oxidation with 2-cyclohexenone, the increased rate with molecular oxygen suggests that the oxidation of molecular oxygen proceeds without the mechanistic need for a proton donor, forming the stable peroxide anion. The result is also consistent with the concept that the flavin potential is modestly lowered, as indicated previously by the shifted maxima of the charge-transfer complexes with phenolic ligands.Table IIOxidative half-reaction with various substratesSubstrateWT OYE12-aData for 2-cyclohexenone and molecular oxygen are from Ref. 21.Y196F OYE1Ratio of k ox (Y196F/WT)k oxK dk oxK dμmμm2-Cyclohexenone102 ± 5 s−132(2.4 ± 0.3) × 10−4 s−1132 × 10−6Methyl vinyl ketone660 ± 170 s−1400.59 ± 0.06 s−11059 × 10−4Cinnamaldehyde17 ± 1 s−11250.48 ± 0.02 s−11803 × 10−2l-Nitrocyclohexene(6.1 ± 0.2) × 105m−1s−1(5.2 ± 0.2) × 105m−1s−10.85(second order)(second order)Molecular O2(3.8 ± 0.1) × 103m−1s−1(7.0 ± 0.1) × 103m−1s−11.85(second order)(second order)2-a Data for 2-cyclohexenone and molecular oxygen are from Ref. 21Brown B.J.

Open table in a new tab The slow rate of oxidation by 2-cyclohexenone with Y196F suggests a model by which to view the turnover data which demonstrated the curtailing of aerobic NADPH oxidase activity in the presence of the enone (Fig. 4). In such a model, on the time scale of the reaction with oxygen, catalysis of oxidation by 2-cyclohexenone may be ignored due to its reduced k ox. The reversible and rapid binding of the enone to the enzyme, however, may influence the oxidative half-reaction with molecular oxygen by reducing the effective concentration of reduced enzyme and making it unavailable for the second-order reaction with oxygen. To assess the validity of this model, the oxidative half-reaction with oxygen was examined in the presence of varying concentrations of 2-cyclohexenone. The reaction is no longer fit to a single exponential. An initial lag phase exists, which can be attributed to the reduced enzyme complex with cyclohexenone previously observed (Fig. 3). The second phase of the reaction is fit to a single exponential, and the direct plot of thek obs values demonstrates the decrease in second-order rate constant with increasing concentration of 2-cyclohexenone, as predicted by the model. The ratio of the rates of the inhibited to the uninhibited reaction were taken as a measure of free enzyme (1-α) in solution at a given concentration of 2-cyclohexenone. A direct plot of the bound enzyme (α)versus varying concentration of 2-cyclohexenone produces a good hyperbolic fit and a K d of 13 μm(inset, Fig. 4). The existence of a charge-transfer complex between reduced enzyme and 2-cyclohexenone is supported by the presence of the initial phase in the reoxidation by molecular oxygen in the presence of the enone. As a test of the accuracy of the model of inhibition and the value for theK d of 2-cyclohexenone generated by the model, we observed the rapid reaction mixing of reduced enzyme with low concentrations of 2-cyclohexenone. With saturating enone (500 μm) and no molecular O2 present, there is a dead-time increase in absorbance which remains unchanged with time. This gives a measure for a fully bound reduced enzyme complex with an extinction of 2700 m−1 cm −1. Mixing slightly more than half enzyme plus K dconcentration of the enone causes an immediate dead-time increase in the absorbance to a value two-thirds between the reduced and fully bound spectra. This suggests that the determined K dis reasonably accurate and that the dead-time absorbance increase can be confidently assigned to 2-cyclohexenone bound to the reduced enzyme. We may speculate that a similar complex to that detected with Y196F forms with wild type enzyme, but passes as an undetectable dead-time binding event due to the rapid rate of the subsequent reoxidation. Given that kinetic evidence suggests that Tyr-196 acts as a necessary active site acid for the reduction of 2-cyclohexenone, the effect of the residue upon other substrates was examined by observation of their oxidative half-reactions (Table II). Methyl vinyl ketone was selected as a representative straight chain ketone, cinnamaldehyde as a representative extensively conjugated aldehyde and 1-nitrocyclohexene as a member of the class of newly discovered unsaturated nitro substrates for the oxidative half-reaction. 2Y. Meah and V. Massey, manuscript in preparation. The rates were measured by following the reoxidation of the enzyme by monitoring the absorbance at 460 nm with a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The oxidative half-reaction with methyl vinyl ketone occurs largely in the dead time with wild type enzyme, giving statistically difficult to measure rate constants. For the half-reactions with cinnamaldehyde and methyl vinyl ketone, the phase corresponding to the largest change in absorbance was assigned to the oxidation of flavin and used to determine the k ox and K dthrough a double-reciprocal plot. For the half-reactions with 1-nitrocyclohexene and oxygen, the reaction appears second order with relation to concentration of substrate up to the highest concentrations used (800 μm 1-nitrocyclohexene and 620 μmO2). Across the series of substrates for the enzyme, reduced Y196F binds all substrates slightly more weakly than wild type enzyme with the exception of 2-cyclohexenone. The rate of olefinic bond reduction varies significantly across the series of compounds. In all cases with organic substrates, the oxidative half-reaction is impaired in the mutant Y196F. The tight binding of cinnamaldehyde to reduced enzyme without the rapid reduction of the double bond offered a unique opportunity to study the Michaelis complex for the oxidative half-reaction. The cinnamaldehyde analog, 4-N, N-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACNA), introduces an electron-donating dimethylamino group to the cinnamaldehyde chromophore, giving free substrate an absorbance maximum at 398 nm. When reduced Y196F OYE1, generated by the use of an NADPH-generating system, is mixed with DMACNA in the stopped flow diode array spectrophotometer, the initial spectra produced demonstrate a maximum at 428 nm (Fig. 5). This red shift may be attributed to enzy"

Three cDNA clones encoding SATase isoforms (SAT-c, SAT-p, and SAT-m) have been isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the significance of the feedback regulation has not yet been clear in these different isoforms of SATase fromA. thaliana. We constructed the overexpression vectors for cDNAs encoding three SATase isoforms of A. thaliana and analyzed the inhibition of SATase activity by cysteine using the recombinant SATase proteins. In the case of SAT-c, the activity was feedback-inhibited by a low concentration of cysteine (the concentration that inhibits 50% activity; IC50 = 1.8 μm). By contrast, SAT-p and SAT-m were feedback inhibition-insensitive isozymes. We also determined the subcellular localization of three SATase isozymes by the transient expression of fusion proteins of each SATase N-terminal region with jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) in 4-week-old Arabidopsis leaves. The SAT-c-GFP fusion protein was stayed in cytosol, whereas SAT-p-GFP and SAT-m-GFP fusion proteins were localized in chloroplasts and in mitochondria, respectively. These results suggest that these three SATase isoforms, which are localized in the different organelles, are subjected to different feedback regulation, presumably so as to play the particular roles for the production of OAS and cysteine in Arabidopsis cells.

Cysteine biosynthesis in plants plays a key role in the sulfur cycle in nature, because the inorganic sulfur in the environment (e.g. sulfate ion in the soil and sulfur dioxide gas in the air) is fixed into cysteine mainly by this biosynthetic pathway in plants (1Saito K. Singh B. Plant Amino Acids: Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 267-291Google Scholar). Cysteine is incorporated into proteins and glutathione (GSH)1 or serves as the sulfur donor of methionine and sulfur-containing secondary products in plants. The cysteine biosynthetic pathway involves several enzymatic reactions (1Saito K. Singh B. Plant Amino Acids: Biochemistry and Biotechnology.

The final step of cysteine biosynthesis is the reaction of incorporating sulfide moiety into the β-position of alanine. The amino acid moiety is derived from serine throughO-acetyl-l-serine (OAS). Two enzymes, serine acetyltransferase (SATase) (EC 2.3.1.30) and cysteine synthase (O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase) (CSase) (EC 4.2.99.8) are committed in this step. This final step of cysteine biosynthesis seems to exist necessarily in three major compartments of plant cells, cytosol, chloroplasts, and mitochondria, because the presence of SATase (5Smith I.

SATase, which catalyzes the formation of OAS from acetyl-CoA andl-serine, is responsible for the entry step from serine metabolism to cysteine biosynthesis; therefore, it would be logical to postulate the existence of regulation at this step. SATase has been characterized with the purified or partially purified preparations fromPhaseolus vulgaris (5Smith I. Plant Physiol. 1972; 50: 477-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Smith I.K.

The activity of SATase was associated with that of CSase as a multienzyme complex during the purification procedures (16Ruffet M.L. Droux M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Nakamura K. Hayama A. Masada M. Fukushima K. Tamura G.

The cellular activity of SATase is 100–300-fold less than that of CSase (16Ruffet M.L. Droux M. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The importance of OAS in regulation of the entire flux of cysteine formation has been suggested from several physiological studies (19Brunold C. De Kok L.J. Stulen I. Rennenberg H. Brunold C. Rauser W.E. Sulfur Nutrition and Assimilation in Higher Plants-Regulatory Agricultural and Environmental Aspects. SPB Academic Publishing, The Hague, Netherlands1993: 61-75Google Scholar). In fact, the availability of OAS has been found to be rate-limiting for cysteine biosynthesis in feeding experiments (20Rennenberg H. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 560-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Neuenschwander U. Suter M. Brunold C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Saito K. Kurosawa M. Tatsuguchi K. Takagi Y. Murakoshi I. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of OAS to plants led to increase in mRNA accumulation of the sulfate transporter and the rate of sulfate uptake in barley roots (23Smith F.W. Hawkesford M.J. Ealing P.M. Clarkson D.T. Vanden Berg P.J. Belcher A.R. Warrilow A.G.S. Plant J. 1997; 12: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The activities of ATP sulfurylase and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase in Lemna minor were also enhanced by supplement of OAS (21Neuenschwander U. Suter M. Brunold C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that SATase and OAS are the major regulatory factors in the biosynthesis of cysteine in plants. We have previously isolated a cDNA clone encoding SATase of presumable cytosolic localization from Citrullus vulgaris(watermelon) (24Saito K. Yokoyama H. Noji M. Murakoshi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant watermelon SATase produced in Escherichia coli was highly sensitive to feedback inhibition by l-cysteine, the end-product of the biosynthetic pathway, at the physiological concentration (∼3 μm) in an allosteric manner (24Saito K. Yokoyama H. Noji M. Murakoshi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of cysteine is normally ∼10 nmol/g fresh weight (22Saito K. Kurosawa M. Tatsuguchi K. Takagi Y. Murakoshi I. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar,25Rennenberg H. Phytochemistry. 1982; 21: 2771-2781Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, we proposed that this feedback inhibition at the physiological concentration of l-cysteine certainly plays a central role in the regulation of cysteine biosynthesis. However, in P. vulgaris (15Smith I.K. Thompson J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and spinach (7Brunold C. Suter M. Planta. 1982; 155: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the inhibition for SATase was observed only at nonphysiologically high cysteine concentrations for partially purified enzyme preparations. Hitherto, fromArabidopsis thaliana, several cDNA clones of SATase have been isolated (8Ruffet M.L. Lebron M. Droux M. Douce R. Eur. J.

Thus, the significance of regulation by the feedback inhibition has not yet been clear in plant SATases, in particular, for different isoforms presumably localized in particular organelles. The present study was conducted to confirm that the feedback inhibition of SATase is actually effective in the regulation of cysteine biosynthesis in particular organelle by analyzing the mode of inhibition using the recombinant SATases from Arabidopsis. In view of amino acid sequences and the difference in subcellular localization, which is clarified in our present study, of the Arabidopsis SATase isoforms, these SATase isoforms can be divided into three groups: (i) SAT-c, that is a cytosolic isoform, identical to SAT52 (30Howarth J.R. Roberts M.A. ray J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); (ii) SAT-p, that is a plastidic isoform, identical to SAT1 (27Murillo M. Foglia R.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and SAT-A (28Hell R. Bogdanova N. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1498Google Scholar) except for the length of N-terminal region. SAT1–6 and SAT-A lack the 87 and 55 N-terminal amino acid residues of SAT-m, respectively. Therefore, we refer these three SATase isoforms as SAT-c, SAT-p, and SAT-m throughout in this paper. Here we report that there are two types of SATase isoforms in Arabidopsis regarding cysteine feedback inhibition, one feedback-sensitive and the other feedback-insensitive. We also clarified the subcellular localization of these SATase isozymes in Arabidopsis leaves, and then we discuss the implication of the differences in feedback inhibition of SATase for the regulation of cysteine biosynthesis in different organelles. A. thaliana (Columbia ecotype) plants were grown on germination medium agar plates (31Valvekens D. Montagu M.V. Lijsebettens M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5536-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) under 16-h light (approximately 2500 lux) and 8-h dark cycles at 22 °C. After 3–6 weeks, the plants were used for isolating total RNA and experiments of particle gun bombardment. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidine hydrochloride/phenol method (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989Google Scholar) from whole plants of Arabidopsis that have been grown for 3 weeks. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography as described elsewhere (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989Google Scholar). First-stranded cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA by use of First-strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Differently, total RNA was isolated from the above-ground part of 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants by the phenol/SDS method and precipitated by LiCl (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989Google Scholar). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA by using CapFinder cDNA Synthesis kit (CLONTECH). The plasmids used in this study are described in Table I.

Roberts M.A. ray J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) or TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa) was used for all PCR experiments. Two oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the N and C terminus of SAT-c were synthesized as follows: forward, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCCACCGGCCGGAGAACT-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCTACCCATATGACAACAACTTTATATGATGTAATC-3′. We designed these primers to create the NdeI sites to both ends of amplified SAT-c cDNA fragment. The oligonucleotide primers were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase as described elsewhere (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989Google Scholar). The amplified cDNA fragment of SAT-c was subcloned into theEcoRV site of pBluescript II KS− (Stratagene), and the resulting plasmid was designated as pSAT-c. Then, the nucleotide sequence of SAT-c cDNA was confirmed to be identical to that reported as SAT52 (30Howarth J.R. Roberts M.A. ray J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) by the dideoxy chain termination method using Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a Shimadzu DNA sequencer model DSQ1000. The full-length version of SAT-m cDNA, which is identical to Sat-1 (29Roberts M.A. Wray J.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was obtained from Arabidopsis double-stranded cDNAs by PCR using two synthetic primers (forward, 5′-TTTTTGGATCCATGTTGCCGGTCACAAGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACGATCCATGGACTTTTTCAAATTACA-3′), which were derived from the previously reported sequence (29Roberts M.A. Wray J.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into the pT7Blue T-Vector (Novagen) to afford pSAT-m, and the nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA fragment was confirmed by sequencing as described above. The 0.95-kilobase pair NdeI fragment containing the full-length cDNA of SAT-c was recovered from the plasmid, pSAT-c, described above and was inserted into NdeI site of pET3a (33Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) (Novagen) to afford pAS-c. For the overexpression of SAT-p, NcoI sites were created on both ends of SAT-p coding region by PCR engineering using two synthetic primers: forward, 5′-ACGATCCATGGCAACATGCATCCACAC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTCCCCATGGTGTTAAATCACATAAT-3′. The engineered cDNA fragment was inserted into the NcoI site of pET3d (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989Google Scholar) (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid was designated as pAS-p. Likewise, we constructed the overexpression vector of truncated SAT-m, which was designated as pAS-m, using primers: forward, 5′-ACTCCCCATGGCTGCGTGCATCGACAC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACGATCCATGGACTTTTTCAAATTACA-3′. In these plasmids, pAS-c, pAS-p, and pAS-m, each SATase cDNA was placed under the strong φ10 promoter in the sense orientation. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE cell (Novagen), in which the gene for lysogenic T7 RNA polymerase under the lac UV5 promoter is induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, was used as host for overexpression of the recombinant SATase proteins. Overnight cultures of E. coli cells carrying the recombinant plasmid were inoculated at 1:100 dilution in 1 liter of LB medium (10 g of Bacto-tryptone, 5 g of Bacto yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl/liter) containing 100 mg/ml carbenicillin and were grown for 3 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. The cells (5 g) were harvested, washed with saline once, and resuspended in buffer A (50 ml) containing 200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The cell suspensions were disrupted by sonication, for 10 times at 100 watts for 20 s each on ice. The soluble protein extracts of E. coli BL21 transformants were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g and then were subjected to fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate (20–80% saturation). The precipitates redissolved in buffer B, containing 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanal, and 0.5 mm EDTA, were desalted by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column and then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column. The absorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1–0.5 m) in buffer B. The combined fractions containing each SATase isozyme were concentrated by the ultrafiltration using Deaflo Ultrafilters (Amicon). SDS-PAGE was carried out in 12% acrylamide gel by the standard method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The molecular weight marker kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for calibration. Protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye using a Quick CBB kit (Wako). Western blotting and immunostaining were carried out on an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) using phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Life Technologies, Inc.) as substrates. The rabbit primary antibody against the recombinant SATase of watermelon (24Saito K. Yokoyama H. Noji M. Murakoshi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16321-16326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was used at 1:400 dilution. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The SATase activities were determined by monitoring of the decrease in A 232due to the cleavage of thioester bond of acetyl-CoA (35Baecker P. Wedding R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The standard mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA, 1 mml-serine, and enzyme solution, in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of l-serine and carried out at 37 °C. The initial velocity of the decrease in absorbance at 232 nm was monitored. The molar extinction coefficient of acetyl-CoA of ε = 4500 was used for calculation. The cDNA fragments of SATase N-terminal regions were obtained from each full-length SATase cDNA by PCR and fused toSalI-NcoI site at the 5′-end of GFP. A 176-base pair fragment of SAT-c (PCR-amplified with primers: forward, 5′-TACGCGTCGACATGCCACCGGCCGG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCATGCCATGGCCGCCTTGATCTGTGTCC-3′), a 185-base pair fragment of SAT-p (amplified using primers: forward, 5′-TACGCGTCGACATGGCAACATGCATC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCATGCCATGGCTTTGAGCATCTTGATCC-3′), and a 416-base pair fragment of SAT-m (amplified using primers: forward, 5′-TACGCGTCGACATGTTGCCGGTCAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCATGCCATGGCTTCTCGGATTTTGGCCC-3′) were subcloned into the GFP expression vector, sGFP (S65T) (36Chiu W.L. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), in which GFP gene is driven by cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and the resulting plasmids were designated pSAT-c-GFP, pSAT-p-GFP, and pSAT-m-GFP, respectively. The plasmid, 35SΩ-TP-sGFP (S65T) (36Chiu W.L. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), carrying transit peptide sequence obtained from the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) small subunit polypeptide of Arabidopsis (37Krebbers E. Seutinck J. Herdies L. Cashmore A.R. Timko M.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 745-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control for localization in chloroplasts. The plasmid, pCS-C-GFP, containing the transit peptide sequence of spinach mitochondrial cysteine synthase C (CS-C) (38Saito K. Tatsuguchi K. Takagi Y. Murakoshi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28187-28192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Takahashi H. Saito K. Plant Pysiol. 1996; 112: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) fused to GFP, was used as a positive control for localization in mitochondria. The primers (forward, 5′-TACGCGTCGACATGGCAACTGTGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCATGCCATGGCATTAGTCCCAGTA-3′) were used for PCR amplification of CS-C transit peptide sequence. The plasmid, sGFP (S65T), without any fusion protein was used as a positive control for localization in cytosol and partly in nuclei as intrinsic nature of GFP. Particle gun bombardment on Arabidopsis tissues was carried out by Helios Gene-Gun System (Bio-Rad) by following standard protocol provided by the supplier. Gold particle (diameter: 1.0 μm), microcarrier loading quantity of 0.5 mg gold/target and DNA loading ratio of 2 μg DNA/mg gold were chosen for the particle bombardment, and 4- or 6-week-old Arabidopsis plants were bombarded at pressure 100 p.s.i./shot. After bombardment, Arabidopsis plants were cultivated for 20 h under illumination at 22 °C. Individual leaf was visualized with a fluorescent microscope (BX50-FLA, Olympus) using the Chroma's Dual Band filter, FITC & TRITC (Olympus), which provides excitations at 475–490 and 545–565 nm and emissions at 510–530 and 585–620 nm. We constructed three recombinant genes, pAS-c, pAS-p, and pAS-m, for overexpression of SATase cDNA in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE cells to obtain the recombinant SATase proteins. The recombinant genes, pAS-c and pAS-p, were designed to produce the full-length recombinant proteins of SAT-c (32.7 kDa) and SAT-p (34.2 kDa), respectively, whereas pAS-m was constructed to produce the truncated recombinant SAT-m (36.5 kDa), which was translated from internal ATG codon (methionine 56) of the full-length SAT-m cDNA (Fig. 1). This lack of 55 N-terminal amino acid residues of SAT-m protein does not presumably influence the enzymatic property of mature SAT-m, because the lacking region is in the part of transit peptide (see later). The overexpressed recombinant SATase isozymes were obtained fromE. coli transformants and then partially purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The partially purified SATase isoforms were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent dye staining (Fig. 2 A) and immunostaining (Fig. 2 B). The protein bands corresponding to recombinant SATase proteins evidently detected by both dye staining and immunostaining in each transformant with pAS-c, pAS-p, and pAS-m. The apparent molecular mass of SAT-c (34.5 kDa) was larger than the predicted molecular mass of SAT-c on SDS-PAGE gel. The partially purified SAT-m exhibited two bands of 36.5 and 33 kDa that reacted with antibody. The 33-kDa protein was detected in the fresh extract of E. coli transformed with pAS-m, and the amount of the 33-kDa protei"

A number of NHRs are involved in developmental and/or metabolic processes, and modulation of NHR activity is an effective strategy in the treatment of a variety of cancers, such as breast cancer (2Jordan V.C.

Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations and is characterized by a post-insulin receptor defect that has been difficult to target therapeutically until the recent discovery that thiazolidinediones (TZDs) enhance the actions of insulin at a level distal to the insulin receptor (6Henry R.R. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1997; 26: 553-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).The mechanism of TZD action is not completely understood, but a number of lines of evidence point to their function as ligands for a member of the NHR superfamily called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), the natural ligand of which may be derived from or related to prostaglandin J2 (7Yu K.

One of the most potent TZDs, BRL49653, binds to PPARγ with an affinity in the nanomolar range (10Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

Cobb J.E. Cowan D.J. Wiethe R.W. Correa I.D. Prakash S.R. Beck K.D. Moore L.B. Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 12Berger J.

Nevertheless, a number of questions remain with regard to the mechanism of TZD potentiation of insulin action. The main problem is that PPARγ is primarily expressed in adipose tissue (13Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 14Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), whereas muscle is ordinarily the main site of insulin-dependent glucose disposal in mammals. This apparent paradox has not yet been satisfactorily resolved.We have studied a novel TZD called MCC-555 that is more potent than BRL49653 in vivo yet has lower affinity for PPARγ. Moreover, MCC-555 binding activates transcription by the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD) differently in different contexts, in part because of novel effects on coactivator recruitment. This raises the possibility that only a subset of the functions of activated PPARγ contributes to insulin sensitivity, and that therapeutic strategies for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that target these functions may lead to compounds with increased potency and decreased toxicity.DISCUSSIONThe treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has recently been improved by the identification of TZDs as novel agents with the unique ability to potentiate insulin action at a level of signaling that is distal to the insulin receptor. The discovery that TZDs are nanomolar PPARγ ligands and that their abilities to activate PPARγ correlate with their enhancement of insulin action suggests that these two actions of TZDs are related. Our results are very important in this context. There are a number of current theories of TZD action. PPARγ is mainly expressed in adipose tissue, and thus one possibility is that PPARγ activation stimulates insulin-mediated glucose uptake to such a large extent in adipose tissue that blood sugar is lowered despite the fact that muscle is ordinarily the main site of insulin-dependent glucose disposal in mammals. Another possibility is that TZD activation of PPARγ induces adipocytes to send an insulin-enhancing signal to muscle; possibilities include reduced levels of adipocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor α (40Peraldi P. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) or free fatty acids (41Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.-M. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the very low amounts of PPARγ in muscle are sufficient for TZDs to directly affect insulin action in that tissue (42Parks K.S. Ciaraldi T.P. Abrams-Carter L. Mudaliar S. Nikoulina S.E. Henry R.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or that TZDs have other direct effects on muscle besides activation of PPARγ.The ability of MCC-555 to function as a potent antidiabetic agent and to possess novel PPARγ-activating properties has a number of potential implications. Certainly, if PPARγ activation is sufficient for the antidiabetic effects of TZDs, the potency of MCC-555 indicates that partial or context-dependent agonism of PPARγ is sufficient for these antidiabetic effects. Moreover, the antidiabetic potency of MCC-555 is increased relative to BRL49653, which has higher affinity for PPARγ. The effects on adipose gene expression in vivo are likely to be related to more favorable pharmacokinetics of MCC-555, leading to stimulation of PPARγ-responsive genes in adipose tissue. However, MCC-555 is also associated with reduced cardiac and hematopoietic side effects relative to other TZDs (20Ishii S. Wasaki M. Ohe T. Ueno H. Tanaka H. Diabetes. 1996; 45 Suppl. 2 (abstr.): 141AGoogle Scholar). Thus, it is possible either that 1) the differential ability of MCC-555 to activate the PPARγ LBD depending on the context of the DBD to which it is fused is somehow favorable in terms of antidiabetic effects or 2) a subset of the full range of agonistic effects of other TZDs, such as BRL49653, is somehow detrimental to the therapeutic effects of these full agonists. Of course, it is also possible that MCC-555 has other targets in addition to PPARγ. There may thus be additional or alternative targets of MCC-555 in fat or muscle that contribute to its unique pharmacological and therapeutic profile in diabetes.The unique properties of MCC-555 are not completely understood. Unlike the ER partial agonist tamoxifen, the A/B domain of PPARγ was not essential for full activation from a PPRE-containing reporter gene. While this work was under review, Blanco et al. (43Blanco J.C. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) reported that p300/CBP-associated factor functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator by binding to the receptor DBD (43Blanco J.C. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This could explain the ability of MCC-555 to fully activate PPARγ transcription from the PPRE, because that process requires the PPARγ DBD, which is absent from the Gal4 and tet fusion proteins. By contrast, the ability of MCC-555 to function as a full agonist with full-length PPARγ suggests that SRC-1, the recruitment of which by MCC-555 is submaximal, is not rate-limiting in this situation. This is consistent with the recent description of promoter-specific requirements for p300/CBP-associated factor, CBP, SRC-1, and other coactivators (44Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). We also cannot rule out the possibility of a specific coactivator that plays a critical role in insulin action and is differentially recruited by MCC-555. Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs)1 constitute a class of transcription factors with activity that is regulated by natural or synthetic lipophilic ligands (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

A number of NHRs are involved in developmental and/or metabolic processes, and modulation of NHR activity is an effective strategy in the treatment of a variety of cancers, such as breast cancer (2Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), prostate cancer (3Dorkin T.J. Neal D.E. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 1997; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and acute promyleocytic leukemia (4Casini T. Grignani F. Pelicci P.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 473-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), as well as metabolic diseases including thyroid disease (5Refetoff S. Weiss R.E. Usala S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 348-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) and diabetes. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations and is characterized by a post-insulin receptor defect that has been difficult to target therapeutically until the recent discovery that thiazolidinediones (TZDs) enhance the actions of insulin at a level distal to the insulin receptor (6Henry R.R. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1997; 26: 553-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The mechanism of TZD action is not completely understood, but a number of lines of evidence point to their function as ligands for a member of the NHR superfamily called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), the natural ligand of which may be derived from or related to prostaglandin J2 (7Yu K.

One of the most potent TZDs, BRL49653, binds to PPARγ with an affinity in the nanomolar range (10Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar), and the rank order of TZD potency for in vivo plasma glucose lowering correlates well with their rank order potency for PPARγ activation (11Willson T.M. Cobb J.E. Cowan D.J. Wiethe R.W. Correa I.D. Prakash S.R. Beck K.D. Moore L.B. Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 12Berger J.

Nevertheless, a number of questions remain with regard to the mechanism of TZD potentiation of insulin action. The main problem is that PPARγ is primarily expressed in adipose tissue (13Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 14Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), whereas muscle is ordinarily the main site of insulin-dependent glucose disposal in mammals. This apparent paradox has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. We have studied a novel TZD called MCC-555 that is more potent than BRL49653 in vivo yet has lower affinity for PPARγ. Moreover, MCC-555 binding activates transcription by the PPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD) differently in different contexts, in part because of novel effects on coactivator recruitment. This raises the possibility that only a subset of the functions of activated PPARγ contributes to insulin sensitivity, and that therapeutic strategies for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that target these functions may lead to compounds with increased potency and decreased toxicity. DISCUSSIONThe treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has recently been improved by the identification of TZDs as novel agents with the unique ability to potentiate insulin action at a level of signaling that is distal to the insulin receptor. The discovery that TZDs are nanomolar PPARγ ligands and that their abilities to activate PPARγ correlate with their enhancement of insulin action suggests that these two actions of TZDs are related. Our results are very important in this context. There are a number of current theories of TZD action. PPARγ is mainly expressed in adipose tissue, and thus one possibility is that PPARγ activation stimulates insulin-mediated glucose uptake to such a large extent in adipose tissue that blood sugar is lowered despite the fact that muscle is ordinarily the main site of insulin-dependent glucose disposal in mammals. Another possibility is that TZD activation of PPARγ induces adipocytes to send an insulin-enhancing signal to muscle; possibilities include reduced levels of adipocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor α (40Peraldi P. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) or free fatty acids (41Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.-M. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the very low amounts of PPARγ in muscle are sufficient for TZDs to directly affect insulin action in that tissue (42Parks K.S. Ciaraldi T.P. Abrams-Carter L. Mudaliar S. Nikoulina S.E. Henry R.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1230-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or that TZDs have other direct effects on muscle besides activation of PPARγ.The ability of MCC-555 to function as a potent antidiabetic agent and to possess novel PPARγ-activating properties has a number of potential implications. Certainly, if PPARγ activation is sufficient for the antidiabetic effects of TZDs, the potency of MCC-555 indicates that partial or context-dependent agonism of PPARγ is sufficient for these antidiabetic effects.

In particular, by sequencing additional 28.5 kilobase pairs we show that the nine modules involved in the binding of the nine amino acids of syringomycin are localized on SyrB and SyrE, with SyrE carrying eight modules. The recombinant SyrB and the first and second modules of SyrE (SyrE1 and SyrE2) have been expressed in Escherichia coliand purified. The biochemical data indicate that SyrB binds threonine, the putative precursor of the last amino acid of syringomycin, whereas SyrE1 and SyrE2 bind serine, the first and the second amino acids of syringomycin, respectively. On the basis of the sequence analysis and the biochemical data presented here, it appears that syringomycin synthetase is unique among peptide synthetases in that its genetic organization does not respect the “colinearity rule” according to which the order of the amino acid binding modules along the chromosome parallels the order of the amino acids on the peptide. This feature, together with the absence of a single transcription unit and the absence of epimerase-like domains make syringomycin synthetase more related to the eukaryotic peptide synthetases than to the bacterial counterparts.

Syringomycin is composed of a polar peptide head, having the sequence Ser-d-Ser1-d-Dab-Dab-Arg-Phe-Dhb-(3-OH)Asp-(4-Cl)Thr, linked to a hydrophobic 3-hydroxy fatty acid tail with 10, 12, or 14 carbon atoms (4Scaloni A.

Natural Product Lett. 1994; 4: 159-164Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Transposon mutagenesis has revealed that insertions in a chromosomal region larger than 25 kb result in the loss of syringomycin production probably as a consequence of the inactivation of one or more large proteins proposed to be part of the syringomycin synthetase complex (1Xu G-W.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while syrC encodes a thioesterase-like enzyme, a protein often found at one end of bacterial peptide synthetase operons (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Interestingly, syrD, transcribed in the opposite orientation with respect to syrBand syrC, codes for a protein remarkably similar to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette transporter proteins involved in target-specific secretion. It has been proposed that thesyrD product might be involved in the transport of syringomycin across the cytoplasmic membrane (6Quigley N.B. Mo Y-Y. Gross D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally,syrP (7Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is located between syrB and syrD, exhibits similarity to the phosphotransfer regions of histidine kinases such as CheA (9Surette M.G. Levit M. Liu Y. Lukat G. Ninfa E.G. Ninfa A. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Ypd1 (10Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed to participate in a phosphorelay mechanism of signal transduction that controls syringomycin synthesis and influences the virulence of P. syringae.The structural features and, most relevant, the available sequence information indicate that syringomycin is synthesized by means of a multienzymatic complex. However, the genetic analysis carried out so far would suggest that the syringomycin synthetase system differs from the typical bacterial peptide synthetases. In fact, all bacterial peptide synthetases are organized in operon-type structures, with the amino acid binding domain coding regions aligned along the chromosome according to the “colinearity rule” (11Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kleinkauf H. von Dohren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In syringomycin, a gene coding for one of the putative amino acid binding domains (thesyrB gene) is not part of an operon encoding all the amino acid binding domains. Furthermore, on the basis of transposon mutagenesis experiments it could be predicted that additional structural genes are located downstream fromsyrC. 2B. K. Scholz-Schroeder, I. Grgurina, and D. Gross, unpublished observations. 2B. K. Scholz-Schroeder, I. Grgurina, and D. Gross, unpublished observations.In an attempt to shed light on the structural organization of the syringomycin synthetase genes, we sequenced the 30 kbp region located downstream from syrC. From the sequence analysis as well as from the biochemical data presented here we show that the syringomycin synthetase has unique structural features more similar to eukaryotic peptide synthetases than to the bacterial counterparts. Furthermore, the unusual architecture with which two amino acid binding modules are structured provides an additional example of how elegantly nature takes advantage of the organization of peptide synthetases in functionally independent domains to generate new enzymes.DISCUSSIONWith the present work we have completed the characterization, started by Gross and co-workers (1Xu G-W. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5680-5688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of the genetic region which in P. syringae is responsible for the synthesis of the lipopeptide syringomycin. From the previously published work as well as from the data reported here, it appears that syringomycin synthetase has a number of features both at the genetic and structural level that make it unique among all bacterial peptide synthetases so far characterized.The first unusual feature is the organization of the syringomycin synthetase structural genes. Four genes had been previously identified to be involved in the synthesis of syringomycin, syrB and syrC with putative structural properties and syrDand syrP with secretory and regulatory functions (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Quigley N.B. Mo Y-Y. Gross D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now completed the characterization of the syringomycin gene cluster and from this work we found that syrB is actually organized in two ORFs, syrB1 and syrB2 encoding two proteins with a molecular mass of 67 kDa and 36 kDa, respectively. The 67-kDa protein carries all the relevant conserved regions of the amino acid binding modules of peptide synthetases. Still unknown is the putative function of SyrB2. Furthermore, an additional structural gene (syrE) was localized downstream from syrCencoding a protein of 9454 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 1,038,663 Da, the largest bacterial protein so far identified. 3GenBankTM sequence data base,http://www.NCBI.nlm.nih.gov (submission 7/98). Secondly, our biochemical data indicating that SyrB1 binds threonine, the putative precursor of the amino acid found at the ninth position in syringomycin, and SyrE1 binds the first amino acid serine, clearly show that the colinearity rule, according to which the order of the amino acid binding modules along the chromosome parallels the order of the amino acids in the peptide, does not hold for the syringomycin synthetase system. These experimental data fit nicely the observation that in SyrB1 the condensation domain typically found at the N terminus of the first domains of lipopeptide synthetases is missing whereas such a domain is fused to SyrE1. This is the first example of such an organization among all peptide synthetases studied so far. Interestingly, very recently we have demonstrated that in surfactin synthetase the coordinated transcription of the enzyme subunits can be altered and the amino acid binding modules can be dissociated without substantially affecting the synthesis of surfactin at both the qualitative and quantitative level (19Merriman T.R. Merriman M.E. Lamont I.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 252-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data, together with the experimental evidence showing that the purified surfactin synthetase subunits can reassociate in vitro to give a functional enzyme (22Menkhaus M. Ullrich C. Kluge B. Vater J. Vollenbroich D. Kamp R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7678-7684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), led us to the conclusion that protein-protein interactions rather than coordinated transcription and translation guide the correct assembling of peptide synthetases. In this context, syringomycin synthetase is a natural example of what we have demonstrated by gene manipulations.Thirdly, in all prokaryotic peptide synthetases the thioesterase moiety, which appears to be involved in the release of the mature peptide chain from the enzyme, is fused to the C-terminal end of the last amino acid binding module (8Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In the case of syringomycin synthetase, the TE domain is found fused to the C terminus of SyrE8 and not, as one would predict, at the end of SyrB1. Apart from its unusual feature, this structural organization poses the question on how can a premature peptide of eight amino acids not be released before the completion of syringomycin synthesis. Most likely, the answer to this question is found in the atypical architecture of SyrE8. Differently from the other synthetases in which the TE domain is directly fused at the C-terminal end of the last amino acid binding module, in SyrE8 an intervening sequence keeps TE apart from the thiolation motif and most likely prevents the thioesterase from releasing the 8-amino acid peptide. Even more interesting is the fact that the intervening sequence is constituted by an amino acid binding module in which the adenylation domain is missing. Considering that in SyrB1 the adenylation domain is not preceded by the condensation domain, one could envisage a situation in which a fully functional module is reconstituted by the proper interaction of SyrB1, which provides the amino acid specificity domain, with the intervening sequence of SyrE8, which provides the condensation and the thiolation domain (Fig. 5).Finally, because the second and third amino acids of syringomycin are in the d configuration (d-serine andd-aminobutyric acid (4Scaloni A. Bachmann R.C. Takemoto J.Y. Barra D. Simmaco M. Ballio A. Natural Product Lett. 1994; 4: 159-164Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), comparisons to other bacterial peptide synthetases predict the presence of an epimerization domain fused to the C terminus of both SyrE2 and SyrE3. However, such domains are missing in the SyrE subunit. Therefore, the mechanism by whichd-amino acids are incorporated into syringomycin could involve the direct binding of the d-isomers to the adenylation domains, as postulated for the eukaryotic cyclosporin and Helminthosporium carbonum toxin synthetases (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar,24Scott-Craig J.S. Panaccione D.G. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26044-26049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the attempt to shed light on the mechanism of d-amino acid incorporation, we have also cloned and expressed the SyrE2 domain to determine its amino acid specificity. From our data it appears that SyrE2 recognizes l-serine, in line with the sequence analysis showing a 90% identity between the adenylation modules of SyrE1 and SyrE2. This raises the interesting question on how and when the change of configuration takes place during syringomycin biosynthesis. A possible mechanism could envisage that racemization occurs at the peptidyl or at the aminoacyl stage, as has been proposed for the incorporation of d-valine in both GrsA and TycA (25Pfeifer E. Pavela-Vrancic M. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7450-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Stein T. Kluge B. Franke P. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Vater J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4633-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), provided that an external racemase takes part in the synthetase complex. Considering that various amino acid racemases and epimerases with broad substrate specificity have been characterized from several Pseudomonas and Aeromonas strains (27Inagaki K. Tanizawa K. Tanaka H. Soda K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 173-180Google Scholar, 28Lim Y-H Yokoigawa K. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that some of them might play a role in syringomycin biosynthesis. The mechanism of racemization in syringomycin synthetase could therefore differ from the one proposed for the d-amino acid incorporation in cyclosporin A and Helminthosporium carbonum toxin, where the direct binding of d-amino acids has been postulated. However, it has to be pointed out that there is no experimental evidence showing that purified, recombinant domains of eukaryotic peptide synthetases bind the d-isomers. Therefore, the existence of these two different pathways of d-amino acid incorporation still awaits experimental demonstration.As far as substrate specificity is concerned, the observation that SyrB1 appears to bind threonine and not its chloro derivative is interesting, suggesting that, as is the case for serine epimerization, threonine modification also occurs after recognition and possibly at the peptidyl level. This is in line with the observation that a deschloro analogue of syringomycin is produced in vivo whenP. syringae pv. syringae is grown under chlorine-free conditions (29Grgurina I. Barca A. Cervigni S. Gallo M. Scaloni A. Pucci P. Experientia. 1994; 50: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The length of SyrE, the absence of racemase motifs, and the independent transcription of the coding genes make syringomycin synthetase more similar to the eukaryotic enzymes than to the prokaryotic counterparts. For instance, the 9454-amino acid-long SyrE resembles the cyclosporin synthetase constituted by a single giant protein of 15,282 amino acids containing 11 modules (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and as is the case for syringomycin synthetase, no racemase-like domain can be identified in cyclosporin synthetase (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).How can an enzyme with eukaryotic features be present in a prokaryotic organism? One possible explanation is direct gene transfer from an eukaryotic organism to P. syringae. In line with this hypothesis is (i) the relative poor homology between SyrB and SyrE as compared with the homologies existing among SyrE modules (50% identities among SyrE domains versus the lesser 37% identity between SyrB and any of the SyrE modules) and (ii) the GC content of syrB. While it is similar to the average GC content of other P. syringae pv. syringae genes (59.5% (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), the GC content of syrE is 62.5%. The horizontal transfer of a peptide synthetase gene from prokaryotes to eukaryotes has already been postulated in the case of the ACV (δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine) synthetase (30Weigel B.J. Burgett S.G. Chen V.J. Skatrud P.L. Frolik C.A. Queener S.W. Ingolia T.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Coque J.J. Martin J.F. Calzada J.G. Liras P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our data would suggest that in peptide synthetases such gene exchange could also go in the other direction.If SyrE has been acquired from a eukaryotic organism, why has its structure not changed during evolution to become more similar to the prokaryotic enzymes? Among the possible explanations an attractive one is that the gene could be transcribed and translated in the infected plant cells to exacerbate its pathogenic functions. It should not be difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally. Of relevance is the fact that the syringomycin synthetase genes are activated in response to specific plant signal molecules (7Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mo Y-Y. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5784-5792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus making syringomycin synthetase the only known thiotemplate system for toxin synthesis regulated by external host factors. Most phytopathogenic strains of Pseudomonas syringaepv. syringae secrete cyclic lipodepsipeptide toxins with phytotoxic activity and a wide spectrum of antimicrobial and antifungal properties. The cyclic lipodepsinonapeptide syringomycin is a key virulence determinant of P. syringae pv. syringaestrain B301D and contributes to disease symptom development (1Xu G-W. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5680-5688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Takemoto J.Y. Verma D.S. Molecular Signals in Plant-Microbe Communications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 247-260Google Scholar) by disrupting ion transport and the electrical potential of host plasma membranes (3Hutchison M.L. Gross D.C. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Syringomycin is composed of a polar peptide head, having the sequence Ser-d-Ser1-d-Dab-Dab-Arg-Phe-Dhb-(3-OH)Asp-(4-Cl)Thr, linked to a hydrophobic 3-hydroxy fatty acid tail with 10, 12, or 14 carbon atoms (4Scaloni A. Bachmann R.C. Takemoto J.Y. Barra D. Simmaco M. Ballio A. Natural Product Lett. 1994; 4: 159-164Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Transposon mutagenesis has revealed that insertions in a chromosomal region larger than 25 kb result in the loss of syringomycin production probably as a consequence of the inactivation of one or more large proteins proposed to be part of the syringomycin synthetase complex (1Xu G-W. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5680-5688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four independently transcribed genes, syrB, syrC, syrD, and syrP, covering approximately a 7-kb region, have been sequenced and partially characterized (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Quigley N.B. Mo Y-Y. Gross D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). syrB shares strong similarities with the amino acid binding domains of peptide synthetases (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while syrC encodes a thioesterase-like enzyme, a protein often found at one end of bacterial peptide synthetase operons (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Interestingly, syrD, transcribed in the opposite orientation with respect to syrBand syrC, codes for a protein remarkably similar to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette transporter proteins involved in target-specific secretion. It has been proposed that thesyrD product might be involved in the transport of syringomycin across the cytoplasmic membrane (6Quigley N.B. Mo Y-Y. Gross D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally,syrP (7Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is located between syrB and syrD, exhibits similarity to the phosphotransfer regions of histidine kinases such as CheA (9Surette M.G. Levit M. Liu Y. Lukat G. Ninfa E.G. Ninfa A. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Ypd1 (10Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed to participate in a phosphorelay mechanism of signal transduction that controls syringomycin synthesis and influences the virulence of P. syringae. The structural features and, most relevant, the available sequence information indicate that syringomycin is synthesized by means of a multienzymatic complex. However, the genetic analysis carried out so far would suggest that the syringomycin synthetase system differs from the typical bacterial peptide synthetases. In fact, all bacterial peptide synthetases are organized in operon-type structures, with the amino acid binding domain coding regions aligned along the chromosome according to the “colinearity rule” (11Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kleinkauf H. von Dohren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In syringomycin, a gene coding for one of the putative amino acid binding domains (thesyrB gene) is not part of an operon encoding all the amino acid binding domains. Furthermore, on the basis of transposon mutagenesis experiments it could be predicted that additional structural genes are located downstream fromsyrC. 2B. K. Scholz-Schroeder, I. Grgurina, and D. Gross, unpublished observations. 2B. K. Scholz-Schroeder, I. Grgurina, and D. Gross, unpublished observations. In an attempt to shed light on the structural organization of the syringomycin synthetase genes, we sequenced the 30 kbp region located downstream from syrC. From the sequence analysis as well as from the biochemical data presented here we show that the syringomycin synthetase has unique structural features more similar to eukaryotic peptide synthetases than to the bacterial counterparts. Furthermore, the unusual architecture with which two amino acid binding modules are structured provides an additional example of how elegantly nature takes advantage of the organization of peptide synthetases in functionally independent domains to generate new enzymes. DISCUSSIONWith the present work we have completed the characterization, started by Gross and co-workers (1Xu G-W. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5680-5688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of the genetic region which in P. syringae is responsible for the synthesis of the lipopeptide syringomycin. From the previously published work as well as from the data reported here, it appears that syringomycin synthetase has a number of features both at the genetic and structural level that make it unique among all bacterial peptide synthetases so far characterized.The first unusual feature is the organization of the syringomycin synthetase structural genes. Four genes had been previously identified to be involved in the synthesis of syringomycin, syrB and syrC with putative structural properties and syrDand syrP with secretory and regulatory functions (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Quigley N.B. Mo Y-Y. Gross D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now completed the characterization of the syringomycin gene cluster and from this work we found that syrB is actually organized in two ORFs, syrB1 and syrB2 encoding two proteins with a molecular mass of 67 kDa and 36 kDa, respectively. The 67-kDa protein carries all the relevant conserved regions of the amino acid binding modules of peptide synthetases. Still unknown is the putative function of SyrB2. Furthermore, an additional structural gene (syrE) was localized downstream from syrCencoding a protein of 9454 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 1,038,663 Da, the largest bacterial protein so far identified. 3GenBankTM sequence data base,http://www.NCBI.nlm.nih.gov (submission 7/98). Secondly, our biochemical data indicating that SyrB1 binds threonine, the putative precursor of the amino acid found at the ninth position in syringomycin, and SyrE1 binds the first amino acid serine, clearly show that the colinearity rule, according to which the order of the amino acid binding modules along the chromosome parallels the order of the amino acids in the peptide, does not hold for the syringomycin synthetase system. These experimental data fit nicely the observation that in SyrB1 the condensation domain typically found at the N terminus of the first domains of lipopeptide synthetases is missing whereas such a domain is fused to SyrE1. This is the first example of such an organization among all peptide synthetases studied so far. Interestingly, very recently we have demonstrated that in surfactin synthetase the coordinated transcription of the enzyme subunits can be altered and the amino acid binding modules can be dissociated without substantially affecting the synthesis of surfactin at both the qualitative and quantitative level (19Merriman T.R. Merriman M.E. Lamont I.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 252-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data, together with the experimental evidence showing that the purified surfactin synthetase subunits can reassociate in vitro to give a functional enzyme (22Menkhaus M. Ullrich C. Kluge B. Vater J. Vollenbroich D. Kamp R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7678-7684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), led us to the conclusion that protein-protein interactions rather than coordinated transcription and translation guide the correct assembling of peptide synthetases. In this context, syringomycin synthetase is a natural example of what we have demonstrated by gene manipulations.Thirdly, in all prokaryotic peptide synthetases the thioesterase moiety, which appears to be involved in the release of the mature peptide chain from the enzyme, is fused to the C-terminal end of the last amino acid binding module (8Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In the case of syringomycin synthetase, the TE domain is found fused to the C terminus of SyrE8 and not, as one would predict, at the end of SyrB1. Apart from its unusual feature, this structural organization poses the question on how can a premature peptide of eight amino acids not be released before the completion of syringomycin synthesis. Most likely, the answer to this question is found in the atypical architecture of SyrE8. Differently from the other synthetases in which the TE domain is directly fused at the C-terminal end of the last amino acid binding module, in SyrE8 an intervening sequence keeps TE apart from the thiolation motif and most likely prevents the thioesterase from releasing the 8-amino acid peptide. Even more interesting is the fact that the intervening sequence is constituted by an amino acid binding module in which the adenylation domain is missing. Considering that in SyrB1 the adenylation domain is not preceded by the condensation domain, one could envisage a situation in which a fully functional module is reconstituted by the proper interaction of SyrB1, which provides the amino acid specificity domain, with the intervening sequence of SyrE8, which provides the condensation and the thiolation domain (Fig. 5).Finally, because the second and third amino acids of syringomycin are in the d configuration (d-serine andd-aminobutyric acid (4Scaloni A. Bachmann R.C. Takemoto J.Y. Barra D. Simmaco M. Ballio A. Natural Product Lett. 1994; 4: 159-164Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), comparisons to other bacterial peptide synthetases predict the presence of an epimerization domain fused to the C terminus of both SyrE2 and SyrE3. However, such domains are missing in the SyrE subunit. Therefore, the mechanism by whichd-amino acids are incorporated into syringomycin could involve the direct binding of the d-isomers to the adenylation domains, as postulated for the eukaryotic cyclosporin and Helminthosporium carbonum toxin synthetases (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar,24Scott-Craig J.S. Panaccione D.G. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26044-26049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the attempt to shed light on the mechanism of d-amino acid incorporation, we have also cloned and expressed the SyrE2 domain to determine its amino acid specificity. From our data it appears that SyrE2 recognizes l-serine, in line with the sequence analysis showing a 90% identity between the adenylation modules of SyrE1 and SyrE2. This raises the interesting question on how and when the change of configuration takes place during syringomycin biosynthesis. A possible mechanism could envisage that racemization occurs at the peptidyl or at the aminoacyl stage, as has been proposed for the incorporation of d-valine in both GrsA and TycA (25Pfeifer E. Pavela-Vrancic M. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7450-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Stein T. Kluge B. Franke P. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Vater J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4633-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), provided that an external racemase takes part in the synthetase complex. Considering that various amino acid racemases and epimerases with broad substrate specificity have been characterized from several Pseudomonas and Aeromonas strains (27Inagaki K. Tanizawa K. Tanaka H. Soda K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 173-180Google Scholar, 28Lim Y-H Yokoigawa K. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that some of them might play a role in syringomycin biosynthesis. The mechanism of racemization in syringomycin synthetase could therefore differ from the one proposed for the d-amino acid incorporation in cyclosporin A and Helminthosporium carbonum toxin, where the direct binding of d-amino acids has been postulated. However, it has to be pointed out that there is no experimental evidence showing that purified, recombinant domains of eukaryotic peptide synthetases bind the d-isomers. Therefore, the existence of these two different pathways of d-amino acid incorporation still awaits experimental demonstration.As far as substrate specificity is concerned, the observation that SyrB1 appears to bind threonine and not its chloro derivative is interesting, suggesting that, as is the case for serine epimerization, threonine modification also occurs after recognition and possibly at the peptidyl level. This is in line with the observation that a deschloro analogue of syringomycin is produced in vivo whenP. syringae pv. syringae is grown under chlorine-free conditions (29Grgurina I. Barca A. Cervigni S. Gallo M. Scaloni A. Pucci P. Experientia. 1994; 50: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The length of SyrE, the absence of racemase motifs, and the independent transcription of the coding genes make syringomycin synthetase more similar to the eukaryotic enzymes than to the prokaryotic counterparts. For instance, the 9454-amino acid-long SyrE resembles the cyclosporin synthetase constituted by a single giant protein of 15,282 amino acids containing 11 modules (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and as is the case for syringomycin synthetase, no racemase-like domain can be identified in cyclosporin synthetase (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).How can an enzyme with eukaryotic features be present in a prokaryotic organism? One possible explanation is direct gene transfer from an eukaryotic organism to P. syringae. In line with this hypothesis is (i) the relative poor homology between SyrB and SyrE as compared with the homologies existing among SyrE modules (50% identities among SyrE domains versus the lesser 37% identity between SyrB and any of the SyrE modules) and (ii) the GC content of syrB. While it is similar to the average GC content of other P. syringae pv. syringae genes (59.5% (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), the GC content of syrE is 62.5%. The horizontal transfer of a peptide synthetase gene from prokaryotes to eukaryotes has already been postulated in the case of the ACV (δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine) synthetase (30Weigel B.J. Burgett S.G. Chen V.J. Skatrud P.L. Frolik C.A. Queener S.W. Ingolia T.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Coque J.J. Martin J.F. Calzada J.G. Liras P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our data would suggest that in peptide synthetases such gene exchange could also go in the other direction.If SyrE has been acquired from a eukaryotic organism, why has its structure not changed during evolution to become more similar to the prokaryotic enzymes? Among the possible explanations an attractive one is that the gene could be transcribed and translated in the infected plant cells to exacerbate its pathogenic functions. It should not be difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally. Of relevance is the fact that the syringomycin synthetase genes are activated in response to specific plant signal molecules (7Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mo Y-Y. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5784-5792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus making syringomycin synthetase the only known thiotemplate system for toxin synthesis regulated by external host factors.

Secondly, our biochemical data indicating that SyrB1 binds threonine, the putative precursor of the amino acid found at the ninth position in syringomycin, and SyrE1 binds the first amino acid serine, clearly show that the colinearity rule, according to which the order of the amino acid binding modules along the chromosome parallels the order of the amino acids in the peptide, does not hold for the syringomycin synthetase system. These experimental data fit nicely the observation that in SyrB1 the condensation domain typically found at the N terminus of the first domains of lipopeptide synthetases is missing whereas such a domain is fused to SyrE1. This is the first example of such an organization among all peptide synthetases studied so far. Interestingly, very recently we have demonstrated that in surfactin synthetase the coordinated transcription of the enzyme subunits can be altered and the amino acid binding modules can be dissociated without substantially affecting the synthesis of surfactin at both the qualitative and quantitative level (19Merriman T.R. Merriman M.E. Lamont I.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 252-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data, together with the experimental evidence showing that the purified surfactin synthetase subunits can reassociate in vitro to give a functional enzyme (22Menkhaus M. Ullrich C. Kluge B. Vater J. Vollenbroich D. Kamp R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7678-7684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), led us to the conclusion that protein-protein interactions rather than coordinated transcription and translation guide the correct assembling of peptide synthetases. In this context, syringomycin synthetase is a natural example of what we have demonstrated by gene manipulations. Thirdly, in all prokaryotic peptide synthetases the thioesterase moiety, which appears to be involved in the release of the mature peptide chain from the enzyme, is fused to the C-terminal end of the last amino acid binding module (8Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In the case of syringomycin synthetase, the TE domain is found fused to the C terminus of SyrE8 and not, as one would predict, at the end of SyrB1. Apart from its unusual feature, this structural organization poses the question on how can a premature peptide of eight amino acids not be released before the completion of syringomycin synthesis. Most likely, the answer to this question is found in the atypical architecture of SyrE8. Differently from the other synthetases in which the TE domain is directly fused at the C-terminal end of the last amino acid binding module, in SyrE8 an intervening sequence keeps TE apart from the thiolation motif and most likely prevents the thioesterase from releasing the 8-amino acid peptide. Even more interesting is the fact that the intervening sequence is constituted by an amino acid binding module in which the adenylation domain is missing. Considering that in SyrB1 the adenylation domain is not preceded by the condensation domain, one could envisage a situation in which a fully functional module is reconstituted by the proper interaction of SyrB1, which provides the amino acid specificity domain, with the intervening sequence of SyrE8, which provides the condensation and the thiolation domain (Fig. 5). Finally, because the second and third amino acids of syringomycin are in the d configuration (d-serine andd-aminobutyric acid (4Scaloni A. Bachmann R.C. Takemoto J.Y. Barra D. Simmaco M. Ballio A. Natural Product Lett. 1994; 4: 159-164Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar)), comparisons to other bacterial peptide synthetases predict the presence of an epimerization domain fused to the C terminus of both SyrE2 and SyrE3. However, such domains are missing in the SyrE subunit. Therefore, the mechanism by whichd-amino acids are incorporated into syringomycin could involve the direct binding of the d-isomers to the adenylation domains, as postulated for the eukaryotic cyclosporin and Helminthosporium carbonum toxin synthetases (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar,24Scott-Craig J.S. Panaccione D.G. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26044-26049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the attempt to shed light on the mechanism of d-amino acid incorporation, we have also cloned and expressed the SyrE2 domain to determine its amino acid specificity. From our data it appears that SyrE2 recognizes l-serine, in line with the sequence analysis showing a 90% identity between the adenylation modules of SyrE1 and SyrE2. This raises the interesting question on how and when the change of configuration takes place during syringomycin biosynthesis. A possible mechanism could envisage that racemization occurs at the peptidyl or at the aminoacyl stage, as has been proposed for the incorporation of d-valine in both GrsA and TycA (25Pfeifer E. Pavela-Vrancic M. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7450-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Stein T. Kluge B. Franke P. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Vater J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4633-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), provided that an external racemase takes part in the synthetase complex. Considering that various amino acid racemases and epimerases with broad substrate specificity have been characterized from several Pseudomonas and Aeromonas strains (27Inagaki K. Tanizawa K. Tanaka H. Soda K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 173-180Google Scholar, 28Lim Y-H Yokoigawa K. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that some of them might play a role in syringomycin biosynthesis. The mechanism of racemization in syringomycin synthetase could therefore differ from the one proposed for the d-amino acid incorporation in cyclosporin A and Helminthosporium carbonum toxin, where the direct binding of d-amino acids has been postulated. However, it has to be pointed out that there is no experimental evidence showing that purified, recombinant domains of eukaryotic peptide synthetases bind the d-isomers. Therefore, the existence of these two different pathways of d-amino acid incorporation still awaits experimental demonstration. As far as substrate specificity is concerned, the observation that SyrB1 appears to bind threonine and not its chloro derivative is interesting, suggesting that, as is the case for serine epimerization, threonine modification also occurs after recognition and possibly at the peptidyl level. This is in line with the observation that a deschloro analogue of syringomycin is produced in vivo whenP. syringae pv. syringae is grown under chlorine-free conditions (29Grgurina I. Barca A. Cervigni S. Gallo M. Scaloni A. Pucci P. Experientia. 1994; 50: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The length of SyrE, the absence of racemase motifs, and the independent transcription of the coding genes make syringomycin synthetase more similar to the eukaryotic enzymes than to the prokaryotic counterparts. For instance, the 9454-amino acid-long SyrE resembles the cyclosporin synthetase constituted by a single giant protein of 15,282 amino acids containing 11 modules (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and as is the case for syringomycin synthetase, no racemase-like domain can be identified in cyclosporin synthetase (23Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). How can an enzyme with eukaryotic features be present in a prokaryotic organism? One possible explanation is direct gene transfer from an eukaryotic organism to P. syringae. In line with this hypothesis is (i) the relative poor homology between SyrB and SyrE as compared with the homologies existing among SyrE modules (50% identities among SyrE domains versus the lesser 37% identity between SyrB and any of the SyrE modules) and (ii) the GC content of syrB. While it is similar to the average GC content of other P. syringae pv. syringae genes (59.5% (5Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), the GC content of syrE is 62.5%. The horizontal transfer of a peptide synthetase gene from prokaryotes to eukaryotes has already been postulated in the case of the ACV (δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine) synthetase (30Weigel B.J. Burgett S.G. Chen V.J. Skatrud P.L. Frolik C.A. Queener S.W. Ingolia T.D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3817-3826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Coque J.J. Martin J.F. Calzada J.G. Liras P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our data would suggest that in peptide synthetases such gene exchange could also go in the other direction. If SyrE has been acquired from a eukaryotic organism, why has its structure not changed during evolution to become more similar to the prokaryotic enzymes? Among the possible explanations an attractive one is that the gene could be transcribed and translated in the infected plant cells to exacerbate its pathogenic functions. It should not be difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally. Of relevance is the fact that the syringomycin synthetase genes are activated in response to specific plant signal molecules (7Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mo Y-Y. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5784-5792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus making syringomycin synthetase the only known thiotemplate system for toxin synthesis regulated by external host factors.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is the port of entry of membrane and secretory proteins into the central vacuolar system of all eukaryotic cells (1Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). It is the site at which these proteins are folded to acquire the biological function at their final destination (2Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ER is responsible for delivering only properly folded proteins to their site of action, which requires a very efficient quality control system to recognize aberrant proteins and prevent their further transport (3Gething M., J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar, 4Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 5Pryer N.K.

Improperly folded proteins are subjected to rapid proteasomal degradation after retrograde transport back to the cytosol (6Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A.

This process of retrograde transport (8Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) requires the Sec61 translocon, as demonstrated for a mutated yeast carboxypeptidase yscY (CPY*) (9Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), a mutated pro-α-factor (10Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and the major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain after infection with human cytomegalovirus (11Wiertz E.J.

The latter demonstrates the implication of the ER degradation system in the development of several severe human diseases: in addition to human cytomegalovirus, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has been postulated to take advantage of this pathway to suppress the immune response of the host, thereby increasing the virulence of the infection (12Kerkau T.

Bennink J.R. Orlowski M. Strebel K. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the dedifferentiation of malignant melanocytes seems to be affected by the ER degradation system (14Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the common genetic disease cystic fibrosis a mutated form of the cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator, although otherwise functional, is retained in the ER and rapidly degraded via the proteasome (15Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 16Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator degradation, as well as of degradation of other polytopic membrane proteins known to undergo the ER degradation (as are, for instance, HMG-CoA reductase (17Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and the mutant Sec61–2 protein (18Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar)), remained a mystery: are entire transmembrane proteins extracted from the ER membrane, or are instead only cytosolic domains shaved off by the proteasome acting like a razor? Is this process generally dependent on components known to be crucial for breakdown of ER-localized proteins (7Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)? Cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator and Pdr5, on which we focus in this study, are both members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily of membrane transport proteins, operating from microorganisms to mammalian cells (19Higgins C., F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar, 20Kuchler K. Thorner J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 499-514PubMed Google Scholar). Pdr5, a protein with 12 putative transmembrane spanning domains, is localized in the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (21Egner R. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Egner R. Mahe Y. Pandjaitan R. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and is crucial for the export of cytotoxic compounds, such as antifungal azoles, cycloheximide, rhodamines, and steroids, thereby mediating pleiotropic drug resistance (pdr) (23Bissinger P.H. Kuchler K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, the mutant allelepdr5–26 was described, the product of which, Pdr5-C1427Y, or simply Pdr5*, is retained in the ER membrane and found to have a remarkably reduced steady-state level as compared with wild type Pdr5 localized at the plasma membrane. The mutation is predicted to reside in the last lumenal loop of Pdr5, most likely disturbing proper folding inside the ER (24Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). If Pdr5* were subjected to the ER degradation process described for several mutated proteins (6Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) it could serve as a general model of how polytopic proteins, including mutated cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator, were discovered as to be improperly folded, removed from the ER membrane, and hydrolyzed. Here, we show that Pdr5* is indeed a substrate of the ER degradation process. This led us to uncover the mechanism by which this protein is removed from the ER membrane and degraded. Genetic experiments and methods employing molecular biology were carried out using standard methods (25Guthrie C. Fink G., R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar).

For pulse-chase experiments, 1 ml of cells corresponding to 10 A 600were taken for each time point and labeled with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine. The chase period was performed in prewarmed complete synthetic medium supplemented with 0.6% methionine and 0.2% BSA. Cell lysis, preparation of membranes, and immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described (18Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Pdr5 and Pdr5* were sedimented completely by isolating membranes as verified by immunoblotting. 2R. K. Plemper, R. Egner, K. Kuchler, and D. H. Wolf, unpublished data. After immunoprecipitation, the collected protein A-Sepharose beads were resuspended in sample buffer (8 m urea, 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.03% Bromphenol Blue, 1.5% dithiothreitol) and incubated at 35 °C for 45 min. Proteins were separated on 7.5 or 9.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by fluorography. Cells were grown to anA 600 of 1.0, followed by immunoprecipitation and deglycosylation essentially as described (8Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes were prepared from 10 A 600 of cells, subjected to immunoprecipitation, treated with 0.06 units of endoglycosidase F for 1 h at 37 °C, and finally resuspended in sample buffer. Cells were grown as described and then adjusted to approximately 8 A 600/ml. After adding cycloheximide with a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, 8A 600 of cells were removed at the indicated time points, suspended in sodium azide solution (final concentration, 10 mg/ml), and kept at −80 °C. Cell lysis and preparation of membranes were performed as described before. Collected membranes were incubated in sample buffer at 35 °C for 15 min with vigorous agitation and separated on 7.5 or 9.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins on immunoblots were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown to anA 600 of 1.0–1.5 as described. For Western analysis, 6 A 600 of cells were taken and subjected to lysis, preparation of membranes, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting as described before. Immunofluorescence analysis to determine intracellular localization of Pdr5* was performed as described for Der1 (26Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Cells were grown as described previously. After spheroplasting 50A 600 units of cells (9Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), these cells were gently lysed using a tissue grinder. The lysate was cleared of remaining cells and debris by repeated centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 ×g. The cleared lysate was split into aliquots corresponding to 12.5 A 600. From the time of lysis, all material was kept on ice. Separation of membranes was done by a 30-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. For protease treatment of the pellet, trypsin was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml after resuspension of the pellet, and the samples were incubated for 30 min on ice. If added, Triton X-100 was present at 1%. All treatments were stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid with a final concentration of 10%. After resuspending the pellet in sample buffer at 35 °C for 45 min, proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. For extraction of microsomes, intact vesicles were prepared as described before and incubated for 30 min on ice with the agents indicated, followed by a 20,000 ×g centrifugation for 30 min and trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the supernatant. Pellets and trichloroacetic acid precipitates were resuspended in sample buffer. The Pdr5 peptide AKTGYLTDENATDTC of the extracellular loop 6 (amino acids 1438–1452) was coupled to maleimide activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin of Megathura crenulataaccording to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled hapten was subsequently used for the immunization of rabbits to generate the polyclonal Pdr5-αL6 antiserum. Specificity of Pdr5-αL6 was verified by immunoblotting with total cell lysate obtained from yeast wild type and Δpdr5 strains.2 We first addressed the question of whether the lowered steady state level of Pdr5* is due to rapid degradation and, if so, which cellular degradation system is involved in this process. Therefore, we performed a pulse-chase analysis of Pdr5* in wild type cells to determine its turnover rate (Fig. 1 A). Pdr5* turned out to be unstable with an estimated half-life of approximately 18 min when compared with wild type Pdr5 as calculated from three different experiments (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the apparent molecular mass of Pdr5* was slightly reduced from 175 kDa of wild type Pdr5 to approximately 171 kDa. Treatment with endoglycosidase F showed this to result from a different glycosylation pattern of Pdr5* and Pdr5 (Fig. 1 B). Native Pdr5 is removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis followed by degradation within the vacuole (21Egner R. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Egner R. Mahe Y. Pandjaitan R. Kuchler K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5879-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Hence, the rapid degradation of Pdr5* suggested either acceleration of the vacuolar proteolytic pathway (32Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7963-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Knop M. Schiffer H.H. Rupp S. Wolf D.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or utilization of a different degradation pathway, such as the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome degradation machinery (34Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide chase studies confirmed that the degradation of Pdr5* was unaffected in a proteinase yscApra1/pep4-deficient yeast strain, ruling out an accelerated vacuolar degradation (35Rupp S. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Woolford C.A. Daniels L.B. Park F.J. Jones E.W. Van Arsdell J.N. Innis M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2500-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, Pdr5* was dramatically stabilized in a pre1–1 pre2–2 double mutant, which has functionally attenuated proteasomes unable to degrade several short-lived proteins (37Heinemeyer W. Gruhler A. Mohrle V. Mahe Y. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5115-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). In a mutant strain lacking the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6 and Ubc7, almost complete stabilization of Pdr5* was observed (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that the mutated ABC transporter is indeed degraded by a process that requires Ubc6, Ubc7, and the cytosolic proteasome. We wanted to address the question of whether polyubiquitination of Pdr5* is necessary for degradation (38Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed the mutated ubiquitin species Ub-R48, with Lys48 being replaced by arginine (29Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This prevents the formation of polyubiquitin chains and therefore inhibits hydrolysis of proteasomal substrates (38Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 D, expression of Ub-R48 caused accumulation of Pdr5*, giving direct proof for the necessity of polyubiquitination for proteolysis to occur. In previous studies, several components of the ER degradation system were described that are crucial for the efficient degradation of soluble (e.g. CPY* (8Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar)) and transmembrane ER-localized proteins (e.g. Sec61–2p (18Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and HMG-CoA reductase (17Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar)). These prerequisites of degradation include, for example Der3/Hrd1 (30Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and Hrd3 (17Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar).2 In order to investigate whether the rapid degradation of Pdr5* requires processes in common with the turnover of CPY*, Sec61–2p or HMG-CoA reductase, we expressed Pdr5* in mutant strains lacking theDER3/HRD1 or HRD3 gene. Pulse-chase analysis performed in a der3/hrd1 deletion strain revealed a 4-fold stabilization of Pdr5* (Fig. 3 A), and Western blot with extracts from a Δhrd3 strain demonstrated a dramatic increase in the steady state level of Pdr5* (Fig. 3 B). Immunofluorescence analysis of Pdr5* confirmed for both mutant strains that the accumulated antigenic Pdr5* material was still ER-localized (Fig. 3 C).2 Moreover, we expressed a carboxyl-terminal GFP-tagged version of Pdr5* in theΔder3/hrd1 strain. Likewise, this Pdr5* fusion protein exhibited perinuclear staining indicating ER localization (Fig. 3 C). Based on the finding that wild type GFP-tagged Pdr5 is fully functional,2 we assume no further effects of the GFP tag itself on Pdr5*. In accordance with our results for Sec61–2p, the Pdr5* steady state level was unaffected in yeast cells lacking theDER1 gene required for CPY*-degradation (26Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).2Because it is known that the RING-H2 finger domain within the lumenal tail of Der3/Hrd1 is essential for its function (30Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), a truncated version of Der3, Der3-ΔR, lacking this domain, was expressed in aDER3/HRD1 deletion strain. In a cycloheximide chase experiment, the mutated protein Der3-ΔR was unable to complement theDER3/HRD1 deletion; the degradation rate of Pdr5* was even further reduced when compared with the Δder3/hrd1 strain (Fig. 3 D). Because we obtained similar results for the degradation rate of CPY* and Sec61–2p even when expressing Der3-ΔR in DER3 wild type strains,2 we consider this strong stabilization of Pdr5* to be due to a dominant negative effect of the der3-ΔR allele. Based on these findings and considering the lumenal mutation of Pdr5*, we conclude that the ER degradation process of Pdr5* as a whole is initiated within the lumen of the ER, most likely at the lumenal face of the ER membrane, followed by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation at the cytosolic face. The complete degradation of lumenal ER or single membrane-spanning proteins by the cytosolic proteolytic system requires their dislocation into the cytosol, which is mediated by the Sec61 translocon (9Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 10Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K.

Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), otherwise known as the essential channel for protein import into the ER (1Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Degradation of a multimembrane-spanning protein like Pdr5* in a Sec61p-dependent fashion would indicate retrograde transport of all transmembrane and lumenal domains back into the cytosol. To address this question, we performed pulse-chase analysis of Pdr5* in a yeast strain carrying the temperature-sensitivesec61–2 mutation (39Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) at 25 °C, conditions under which protein import into the ER is unaffected (9Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results obtained for CPY* (9Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), the half-life of Pdr5* increased by 2.3-fold, suggesting a role of Sec61p in the degradation of the polytopic protein (Fig. 4, Aand B). Therefore, membrane extraction of at least some transmembrane domains of the protein has to be assumed. Furthermore, our quantification is based on the disappearance of the antigenic material with a molecular mass of 171 kDa, representing the full-length glycosylated Pdr5* molecule. This excludes an initial cut by additional proteases within cytosolic regions of Pdr5* prior to its rapid degradation by the proteasome, because in such a case one would expect the rapid appearance of at least one degradation intermediate eventually followed by its delayed further degradation. However, we observed no such degradation intermediate of Pdr5* in our pulse-chase analysis. Also, removal of any of the cytosolic tails of Pdr5* by the proteasome prior to extraction can be excluded as the entire Pdr5* molecule is stabilized in the sec61–2 background. To confirm our conclusion that degradation of Pdr5* requires complete membrane extraction, it was important to demonstrate a proper insertion of Pdr5* into the ER membrane in the sec61–2 background. Indeed, ER localization of the Pdr5* protein was unaffected by thesec61–2 mutation. When the GFP-tagged version of Pdr5* was expressed in the sec61–2 strain, perinuclear staining indicating ER localization was observed (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, we determined the general topology of the molecule by analyzing the trypsin sensitivity of the antigenic material after separating cells into a pellet fraction containing the microsomes and"

Exposure to environmental sources of lead is a serious public health concern. In humans chronic lead exposure produces neurotoxicity, anemia, and kidney damage, and acute lead toxicity can be fatal. Neither the specific lead transporters nor the regulatory elements that control the expression of the transporter genes have been identified. As models for human metal toxicity, we have been characterizing transporters for toxic metals and their genetic regulation (1Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Molecular Biology and Toxicology of Metals.in: Koropatnik D.J. Zalups R.K. Taylor and Francis, London1998Google Scholar, 2Rosen B.P. Metalloproteins.in: Higgins S.J. Ballou D.P. 34. Portland Press, Ltd., London1998Google Scholar) and report here the identification of two P-type ATPases that are responsible for Pb(II) extrusion and resistance in bacteria.Bacterial metal ion resistance probably arose early in evolution due to widespread geological occurrence of metals. Bacterial cells have chromosomally and plasmid-encoded mechanisms for extrusion of antimicrobial substances, including toxic soft metals (3Dey S. Rosen B.P. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 103-132Google Scholar). While the ionic forms of some of these metals such as zinc and copper are essential for all organisms, all of these ions are toxic in excess. ZntA from Escherichia coli and CadA from plasmid pI258 of Staphylococcus aureus are both members of the superfamily of P-type cation-translocating ATPases but belong to a subgroup of soft metal transporters that includes CopA, a Cu(I) pump fromEnterococcus hirae, and eukaryotic Cu(I) homeostasis proteins such as the Menkes and Wilson disease-associated proteins (1Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Molecular Biology and Toxicology of Metals.in: Koropatnik D.J. Zalups R.K. Taylor and Francis, London1998Google Scholar,4Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H.

A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and CadA has been shown to transport Cd(II) (7Tsai K.J. Yoon K.P. Lynn A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both have been shown to confer resistance to cadmium and zinc ions (8Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl.

The pI258 cadCA operon is regulated at the transcriptional level by the product of thecadC gene, which encodes the 122-residue CadC repressor (11Yoon K.P. Silver S. J.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, we show that CadC repression of the cadpromoter is relieved upon addition of soft metals, with the order of effectiveness Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Zn(II). In E. coli Zn(II) responsiveness could be observed only in a zntA-disrupted strain. The zntA-disrupted strain of E. coliexhibited hypersensitivity to Pb(II) that was complemented bycadA, indicating that both soft metal-translocating P-type ATPases are essential for Pb(II) resistance in bacteria. Everted membrane vesicles from cells expressing either zntA orcadA exhibited ATP-dependent65Zn(II) accumulation. Since no radioisotopes of Pb(II) are available, direct transport of Pb(II) was not assayed. However, Pb(II) inhibited 65Zn(II) transport, indicating that Pb(II) is a substrate of the two P-type ATPases. These results support the concept that ZntA and CadA are Pb(II) pumps with physiological functions that include to provide resistance to environmental lead.DISCUSSIONIn humans chronic exposure to low levels of lead may cause neurological, reproductive, and developmental problems. Lead exposure is especially harmful to children, and nearly one million American children below the age of 5 years have blood-lead levels that exceed those considered as elevated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (22Environmental Protection Agency Federal Register. 1998; 63: 30301-30356Google Scholar). Even though lead affects virtually every organ and tissue in the body, little is known about the routes of lead ion uptake and extrusion. Even less is known about Pb(II)-regulated gene transcription, and there are no genetic markers for lead exposure. We have undertaken a study of Pb(II)-responsive genes and transporters. The CadC repressor and CadA/ZntA pumps represent the first proteins demonstrated to have a physiological function that includes providing the host organism with a protective response to environmental lead stress.CadA and ZntA are members of the superfamily of P-type cation-translocating ATPases, but belong to a group of soft metal transporters that includes bacterial enzymes such as the CopA Cu(I) pump (23Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the yeast CCC2 Cu(I) pump (24Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the human Cu(I)-transporting ATPases such as MNK (25Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar) and WND (26Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). The soft metal pumps can be further subdivided into the Cu(I)/Ag(I)-translocating ATPases and the Zn(II)/Cd(II)/Pb(II) ATPases (1Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Molecular Biology and Toxicology of Metals.in: Koropatnik D.J. Zalups R.K. Taylor and Francis, London1998Google Scholar). While none of these proteins has yet been demonstrated to catalyze ATP hydrolysis, several have been shown to have properties consistent with being cation-translocating ATPases. First, transport requires ATP and is inhibited by orthovanadate, a classical inhibitor of P-type ATPases (5Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Second, P-type ATPases form a β-acylphosphate intermediate, and several soft metal pumps have been shown to form these intermediates (27Tsai K.J. Linet A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Solioz M. Camakaris J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).CadA had been shown to catalyze ATP-coupled, vanadate-sensitive Cd(II) transport (7Tsai K.J. Yoon K.P. Lynn A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate (27Tsai K.J. Linet A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ZntA has been shown to transport both Zn(II) and Cd(II) in an ATP-requiring, vanadate-sensitive reaction (6Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this paper we report that CadA also transports Zn(II). Despite the unavailability of lead isotopes for direct transport assays, the results described here are consistent with Pb(II) transport catalyzed by members of this subgroup of P-type ATPases. First, Pb(II) induces expression of CadA (Fig. 1). Second, both ZntA and CadA confer Pb(II) resistance (Fig. 2). Third, Pb(II) inhibits 65Zn(II) transport by both ZntA and CadA (Fig. 3, A and B). Fourth, inhibition of ZntA activity by Pb(II) was essentially identical to inhibition by Cd(II), a known pump substrate (Fig. 3 C).Copper pumps are widely distributed in nature, and genetic diseases such as Menkes and Wilsons result from mutations in the genes for these pumps (25Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 26Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). We predict that Zn(II)/Cd(II)/Pb(II) P-type ATPases exist in humans, and it is not unreasonable to expect that there are diseases related to defects in the genes for these pumps. Elucidation of these bacterial model systems may also lead to the development of biomarkers for lead exposure and susceptibility in humans. Exposure to environmental sources of lead is a serious public health concern. In humans chronic lead exposure produces neurotoxicity, anemia, and kidney damage, and acute lead toxicity can be fatal. Neither the specific lead transporters nor the regulatory elements that control the expression of the transporter genes have been identified. As models for human metal toxicity, we have been characterizing transporters for toxic metals and their genetic regulation (1Rensing C. Rosen B.P.

ZntA from Escherichia coli and CadA from plasmid pI258 of Staphylococcus aureus are both members of the superfamily of P-type cation-translocating ATPases but belong to a subgroup of soft metal transporters that includes CopA, a Cu(I) pump fromEnterococcus hirae, and eukaryotic Cu(I) homeostasis proteins such as the Menkes and Wilson disease-associated proteins (1Rensing C.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both have been shown to confer resistance to cadmium and zinc ions (8Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl.

The pI258 cadCA operon is regulated at the transcriptional level by the product of thecadC gene, which encodes the 122-residue CadC repressor (11Yoon K.P. Silver S. J.

In this report, we show that CadC repression of the cadpromoter is relieved upon addition of soft metals, with the order of effectiveness Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Zn(II). In E. coli Zn(II) responsiveness could be observed only in a zntA-disrupted strain. The zntA-disrupted strain of E. coliexhibited hypersensitivity to Pb(II) that was complemented bycadA, indicating that both soft metal-translocating P-type ATPases are essential for Pb(II) resistance in bacteria. Everted membrane vesicles from cells expressing either zntA orcadA exhibited ATP-dependent65Zn(II) accumulation. Since no radioisotopes of Pb(II) are available, direct transport of Pb(II) was not assayed. However, Pb(II) inhibited 65Zn(II) transport, indicating that Pb(II) is a substrate of the two P-type ATPases. These results support the concept that ZntA and CadA are Pb(II) pumps with physiological functions that include to provide resistance to environmental lead. DISCUSSIONIn humans chronic exposure to low levels of lead may cause neurological, reproductive, and developmental problems. Lead exposure is especially harmful to children, and nearly one million American children below the age of 5 years have blood-lead levels that exceed those considered as elevated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (22Environmental Protection Agency Federal Register. 1998; 63: 30301-30356Google Scholar). Even though lead affects virtually every organ and tissue in the body, little is known about the routes of lead ion uptake and extrusion. Even less is known about Pb(II)-regulated gene transcription, and there are no genetic markers for lead exposure. We have undertaken a study of Pb(II)-responsive genes and transporters. The CadC repressor and CadA/ZntA pumps represent the first proteins demonstrated to have a physiological function that includes providing the host organism with a protective response to environmental lead stress.CadA and ZntA are members of the superfamily of P-type cation-translocating ATPases, but belong to a group of soft metal transporters that includes bacterial enzymes such as the CopA Cu(I) pump (23Odermatt A.

The soft metal pumps can be further subdivided into the Cu(I)/Ag(I)-translocating ATPases and the Zn(II)/Cd(II)/Pb(II) ATPases (1Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Molecular Biology and Toxicology of Metals.in: Koropatnik D.J. Zalups R.K. Taylor and Francis, London1998Google Scholar). While none of these proteins has yet been demonstrated to catalyze ATP hydrolysis, several have been shown to have properties consistent with being cation-translocating ATPases. First, transport requires ATP and is inhibited by orthovanadate, a classical inhibitor of P-type ATPases (5Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Second, P-type ATPases form a β-acylphosphate intermediate, and several soft metal pumps have been shown to form these intermediates (27Tsai K.J. Linet A.L. Arch. Biochem.

Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this paper we report that CadA also transports Zn(II). Despite the unavailability of lead isotopes for direct transport assays, the results described here are consistent with Pb(II) transport catalyzed by members of this subgroup of P-type ATPases. First, Pb(II) induces expression of CadA (Fig. 1). Second, both ZntA and CadA confer Pb(II) resistance (Fig. 2). Third, Pb(II) inhibits 65Zn(II) transport by both ZntA and CadA (Fig. 3, A and B). Fourth, inhibition of ZntA activity by Pb(II) was essentially identical to inhibition by Cd(II), a known pump substrate (Fig. 3 C).Copper pumps are widely distributed in nature, and genetic diseases such as Menkes and Wilsons result from mutations in the genes for these pumps (25Vulpe C.

We predict that Zn(II)/Cd(II)/Pb(II) P-type ATPases exist in humans, and it is not unreasonable to expect that there are diseases related to defects in the genes for these pumps.

We now show that CL1 belongs to a family of closely related receptors called CL1, CL2, and CL3. CLs exhibit an unusual multidomain structure with similar alternative splicing and large extra- and intracellular sequences. CLs share domains with other G-protein-coupled receptors, lectins, and olfactomedins/myocilin. In addition, CLs contain a novel, widespread cysteine-rich domain that may direct endoproteolytic processing of CLs during transport to the cell surface. Although the mRNAs for CLs are enriched in brain, CLs are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. To examine how binding of α-latrotoxin to CL1 triggers exocytosis, we used PC12 cells transfected with human growth hormone. Ca2+-dependent secretion of human growth hormone from transfected PC12 cells was triggered by KCl depolarization or α-latrotoxin and was inhibited by tetanus toxin and by phenylarsine oxide, a phosphoinositide kinase inhibitor. When CL1 was transfected into PC12 cells, their response to α-latrotoxin was sensitized dramatically. A similar sensitization to α-latrotoxin was observed with different splice variants of CL1, whereas CL2 and CL3 were inactive in this assay. A truncated form of CL1 that contains only a single transmembrane region and presumably is unable to mediate G-protein-signaling was as active as wild type CL1 in α-latrotoxin-triggered exocytosis. Our data show that CL1, CL2, and CL3 perform a general and ubiquitous function as G-protein-coupled receptors in cellular signaling. In addition, CL1 serves a specialized role as an α-latrotoxin receptor that does not require G-protein-signaling for triggering exocytosis. This suggests that as an α-latrotoxin receptor, CL1 recruits α-latrotoxin to target membranes without participating in exocytosis directly. α-Latrotoxin, a potent excitatory neurotoxin, binds to two receptors: a G-protein-coupled receptor calledCIRL/latrophilin 1 (CL1) and a cell-surface protein called neurexin Iα.

Meldolesi J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). α-Latrotoxin is thought to act by binding to specific cell surface receptors (2Tzeng M.C. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1979; 33: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain how α-latrotoxin induces exocytosis. 1) α-Latrotoxin activates exocytosis by a Ca2+-independent mechanism that involves the secretory apparatus directly (3Frontali N. Ceccarelli B. Gorio A. Mauro A. Siekevitz P. Tzeng M.C. Hurlbut W.P. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 462-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 2) α-Latrotoxin acts indirectly in exocytosis as a Ca2+ ionophore, allowing Ca2+ influx into the cell (4Finkelstein A. Rubin L.L. Tzeng M.-C. Science. 1976; 19: 1009-1011Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The two proposed mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Each mechanism is supported by a large amount of data, suggesting that both mechanisms are being used (5Matteoli M. Haimann C. Torri-Tarelli F. Polak J.M. Ceccarelli B. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl.

In nerve terminals, α-latrotoxin induces synaptic vesicle exocytosis equally well with or without Ca2+ (3Frontali N. Ceccarelli B. Gorio A. Mauro A. Siekevitz P. Tzeng M.C. Hurlbut W.P. J.

In neuroendocrine cells such as chromaffin cells and PC12 cells, α-latrotoxin stimulates exocytosis only in the presence of Ca2+(11Cattaneo A. Grasso A.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that in neuroendocrine cells, α-latrotoxin primarily uses the second mechanism of action and stimulates exocytosis by Ca2+ influx. Although a direct receptor-based α-latrotoxin action in chromaffin cells has also been proposed (14Bittner M.A. Krasnoperov V.G. Stuenkel E.L. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the inability of neuroendocrine cells to respond to α-latrotoxin in the absence of Ca2+ suggests that these cells lack synaptic components required for a Ca2+-independent mechanism. Two receptors for α-latrotoxin have been cloned. A neuron-specific cell surface protein called neurexin Iα was initially characterized as an α-latrotoxin receptor (15Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). More recently, a G-protein-linked receptor for α-latrotoxin was independently identified by two laboratories and named CIRL or latrophilin1 (abbreviated here as CL1)1 (16Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G.

Neurexin Iα and CL1 bind α-latrotoxin with similarly high affinities but exhibit strikingly different properties. Neurexin Iα binds α-latrotoxin only in the presence of Ca2+, suggesting that α-latrotoxin does not mediate the Ca2+-independent effect of α-latrotoxin (18Davletov B. Krasnoperov V. Hata Y. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23903-23905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CL1, in contrast, binds α-latrotoxin Ca2+ independently. This led to the proposal that CL1 may be responsible for most or all of the actions of α-latrotoxin (16Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R.

Experiments with knockout mice revealed that in the absence of neurexin Iα, the Ca2+-dependent activities of α-latrotoxin were impaired, whereas Ca2+-independent release triggered by α-latrotoxin was unaffected (19Geppert M. Khvotchev M. Krasnoperov V. Goda Y. Missler M. Hammer R.E. Ichtchenko K. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus neurexin Iα functions either as a genuine α-latrotoxin receptor or as an essential Ca2+-dependent co-receptor for α-latrotoxinin. The identification of CL1 as a G-protein-coupled receptor for α-latrotoxin raised the exciting possibility that CL1 constitutes a novel synapse-specific G-protein-linked receptor with a function related to exocytosis. This possibility was supported by the apparent brain-specific expression of CL1 (16Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D.

A synapse-specific G-protein-coupled receptor that directly modulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis would have major implications for our thinking about synaptic regulation. Such a receptor could directly function in regulating synaptic transmission and provide novel approaches to understanding the molecular mechanisms of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Recently we showed that recombinant α-latrotoxin was fully active in triggering neurotransmitter release. 2Ichtchenko, K., Khvotchev, M., Kiyatkin, N., Simpson, L., Sugita, S. S., and Südhof, T. C., EMBO J., in press. Mutant α-latrotoxins with substitutions in conserved cysteine residues or with an insertion of four amino acids lacked this activity. Surprisingly, the mutant toxin with a four-amino acid insertion still bound to CL1 and to neurexin Iα with the same affinity as wild type toxin and stimulated phospholipase C similar to wild type toxin. This result was confirmed in experiments with La3+. La3+ blocked the ability of α-latrotoxin to induce exocytosis without inhibiting its ability to stimulate phospholipase C.2 These data suggest that binding of α-latrotoxin to its receptors and stimulation of phospholipase C are not sufficient for α-latrotoxin to induce exocytosis. However, these findings did not reveal if CL1 is a novel type of G-protein-linked receptor with a synapse-specific function. We have addressed this question in the current study. Our data define CL1 as a member of a novel gene family of related G-protein-linked receptors of unusual size and structure. We find that the receptors related to CL1 are ubiquitously expressed outside of neurons, suggesting a general function not directly related to synapses. Furthermore, we have investigated the mechanism by which α-latrotoxin acts in PC12 cells and demonstrate that CL1 acts in a manner that does not require coupling to G-proteins. Our findings support a model whereby α-latrotoxin evolved to bind to multiple receptors that primarily serve to recruit the toxin to its site of action without mediating its ability to trigger exocytosis. Data bank searches identified multiple human and mouse EST clones encoding homologs of CL1. We used restriction enzyme fragments from three human EST clones (CL2, 0.8-kbEcoRI-XhoI fragment from clone 71509, GenBank accession number T47902; CL3, 0.5-kbEcoRI-HindIII fragment from clone 33529, accession number R19057, and 0.37-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment from clone 285779, accession number N69329) and a PCR product of the 5′ end of the CL1 cDNA to isolate cDNA clones for CL1, CL2, and CL3 from a rat brain cDNA library as described (20Ichtchenko K.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nine independent CL1 clones were isolated and sequenced. The largest clone, pBSCL1OR4, lacked the first 23 amino acids of CL1 (16Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W.

Of four clones extending to the N-terminal site of alternative splicing (residues 132–136, see Fig. 1), two clones (pBSCL1OR4, CL1OR12) lacked and two clones (pBSCL1OR10, CL1OR11) contained an insert. For the alternatively spliced cytoplasmic sequence of CL1 (residues 1146–1189, see Fig. 1), two cDNA clones (pBSCL1OR6 and CL1OR9) contained and two clones (pBSCL1OR1 and CL1OR4) lacked an insert. Of five independent CL2 cDNA clones, pBSCL2–2 contained the entire coding region. The sequence of this clone revealed a possible mutation between residues 125–135 that caused a frameshift and premature termination. To test if this was a cloning artifact, we amplified the corresponding region by PCR with rat brain cDNA. The sequence of the single product confirmed the presence of an open reading frame homologous to that of CL1 and CL3; no PCR products corresponding to the frameshift in pBSCL2–2 were recovered (data not shown). Analysis of the 3′-coding region of CL2 in various cDNA clones uncovered two regions of alternative splicing. At the first (residues 1038–1053, see Fig. 1), an insert was present in pBSCL2–2, CL2–5, and CL2–8 and absent in pBSCL2–1 and CL2–3. The second region (residues 1175–1227) exhibited a complicated pattern of alternative splicing. pBSCL2–1 lacked residues 1175–1184 but contained residues 1185–1227, pBSCL2–3 and CL2–5 contained residues 1175–1185 but lacked residues 1186–1227, and pBSCL2–2 and CL2–8 contained both alternatively spliced regions (see Fig. 1). Of the seven CL3 cDNA clones isolated, four included the N terminus but lacked the C terminus. Three of the N-terminal clones (pBSCL3–15, pBSCL7–6, pBSCL7–13) contained an insert next to the signal peptide (see Fig. 1); one cDNA clone lacked the insert (pBSCL7–4). The C-terminal region of CL3 was recovered in three clones (pBSCL3–1, CL3–2, CL3–7). pBSCL3–2 contained the alternatively spliced regions A and B in the cytoplasmic tail (see Fig. 2), CL3–1 contained only B, and pBSCL3–7 lacked inserts A and B. Sequences were analyzed using the BLAST program suite of NCBI and submitted to GenBank (accession numbers AF081144, AF081145, AF081146, AF081147, AF081148,AF081149, AF081150, AF081151, AF081152, AF081153, AF081154, AF081155,AF081156, AF081157, AF081158, and AF081159).Figure 2Alternative splicing of the intracellular domain of rat and human CL3. The rat DNA sequence is shown on top; nucleotides in the human DNA sequence that are not identical with the rat sequence are noted above the rat DNA sequence. The protein sequence (Pro) is shown below the DNA sequence. Two regions of alternatively spliced DNA sequences were observed in a tandem arrangement. Region A is in-frame (yellow letters on black background) and is followed by region B, which disrupts the reading frame (white letters on black background). Region A corresponds to residues 1271–1313 in Fig. 1 and is also alternatively spliced in CL2; region B is not shown in Fig. 1. Rat cDNA clones lacking regions A and B or containing region B with and without region A were sequenced. Human EST clones containing or lacking both regions were identified in the data banks (e.g. accession numbersR60519 and T78230) and exhibit almost identical sequences. It is possible that all CLs are alternatively spliced with region A and B inserts, leading to shorter (ProA) and longer (ProB) protein variants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The initial CL1 expression vector (pCMVCL1–1) was constructed in the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pCMV5 by fusing a 5.2-kb NheI-HindIII fragment of pBSCL1OR4 to a 0.15-kb EcoRI-NheI PCR fragment from the 5′ end of the mRNA. pCMVL1–1 lacked inserts in both of the alternatively spliced sites and was used to derive pCMVCL1–4, containing an insert in the C-terminal site, and pCMVCL1–5, containing an insert in the N-terminal site of alternative splicing. pCMVL1–4 was generated by replacing the C-terminal BamHI-XbaI fragment in pCMVL1–1 with the 4.1-kb BamHI-AvrII fragment of pBSCL1OR9. pCMVCL1–5 was obtained exchanging the N-terminalBglII-BamHI fragment of pCMVL1–1 with the 0.3-kbBglII-BamHI fragment of pBSCIRLOR10 and shortening the 3′-untranslated region to the AvrII site. The truncated CL1 expression plasmid with a stop codon after the first TMR (pCMVCL1–1STOP891) was constructed in pCMV5 by PCR. The CL2 expression vector pCMVCL2–1 was made by fusing a 4.2-kbBglII-AvrII fragment of pBSCL2–2 to a 0.2-kbBglII PCR fragment from the 5′ end of pBSCL2–2 at theBglII-XbaI site of pCMV5. When it became apparent that the 5′ end of pBSCL2–2 carries a mutation, we replaced it with a 0.25-kb BglII-MfeI PCR fragment to create pCMVCL2–3. Furthermore, we generated a hybrid CL1/CL2 expression vector (pCMVCL2–4) in which a 0.2-kb EcoRI-BglII fragment of pCMVCL1–1 was exchanged for the corresponding fragment in pCMVL2–3. The resultant construct contained N-terminal 70 residues of CL1 followed by the 1407 residues of CL2. For CL3, we obtained a chimeric construct (pCMVCL3/CL1) with the N-terminal 1026 residues of CL3 followed by C-terminal 530 residues of CL1–1 (see Fig. 1). For expression of human growth hormone (hGH) in PC12 cells, a 2.6-kbBamHI-EcoRI fragment encoding hGH was subcloned into the blunted XhoI site of the pCMV5 vector to produce phGHCMV5 in which hGH expression is driven by the SV40 promoter. To test the effect of tetanus toxin light chain on hGH secretion, the coding region of tetanus toxin light chain was subcloned into the polylinker of phGHCMV5 to create phGHCMV-TeTx (22McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y. Link E. Edelman L. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of CL expression on hGH secretion triggered by KCl or α-latrotoxin, phGHCMV5 was co-transfected with pCMVCLs. As control, phGHCMV5 was co-transfected with the empty pCMV5 vector. Expression of the different constructs of CLs were confirmed by COS cell transfections (20Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C and transfected using DEAE-dextran with chloroquin and a 2-min glycerol shock with 6.6 μg of DNA for 900,000 cells in a 10-cm dish. Cells were washed with PBS 72 h after transfections and harvested in 0.4 ml of sample buffer. Samples were passed through a 25 gauge needle (10 times). Aliquots (5–20 μl) were analyzed by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using ECL detection. PC12 cells were maintained in 75-cm2 flasks (uncoated) in RPMI 1640 with heat-inactivated 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Confluent cells were harvested and dissociated by trituration through a 5-ml serological pipette and plated onto collagen-coated, 6-well 35-mm dishes (Costar) at 40–50% confluency. 40–48 h later (70–80% confluency), 2.4 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected by Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium devoid of serum and antibiotics to increase transfection efficiency. After 6 h, 4 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium was added. Two-three days after transfection, PC12 cells from dishes transfected with the same plasmids were harvested and pooled and then re-plated into 12-well 22-mm dishes (Corning) in a ratio of two 22-mm wells for one transfected 35-mm well. One day after re-plating, secretion experiments were conducted with all test and control conditions carried out on the same pool of transfected cells. Controls were treated with physiological saline solution (145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). KCl-triggered secretion was induced by a 15-min incubation with high K+ saline solution (physiological saline solution containing 95 mm NaCl and 56 mm KCl). α-Latrotoxin stimulations were carried out with the indicated concentrations of α-latrotoxin applied for 10 min or 15 min in physiological saline solution. The amounts of hGH secreted into the medium and retained in the cells were measured by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute, CA). RNA blotting experiments were carried out as described (20Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) using commercially available human multitissue RNA blots (CLONTECH). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analyses were performed as described (20Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

The antibodies used were reported previously except for the polyclonal CL1 antibodies, which were raised against an N-terminal 17-residue peptide (LSRAGLPFGLMRRELAC) (antibody U552) and a C-terminal 9-residue peptide (GQMQLVTSL) (U554) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described (20Ichtchenko K.

Multiple candidate EST clones were identified and employed in cDNA library screens to isolate full-length rat clones. In this manner, we obtained cDNA clones encoding three different CLs: CL1 that was described previously and two new homologs that we named CL2 and CL3. We determined the nucleotide sequences of overlapping cDNA clones for all three CLs and aligned their deduced amino acid sequences for maximal homology (Fig. 1). The following findings suggest that our sequences are full-length with respect to the coding region. 1) All three sequences contain an N-terminal sequence resembling a signal peptide; 2) the putative starting methionine codon conforms well to the consensus of initiator methionines; and 3) the previously determined N-terminal sequence of CL1 (16Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G.

The three CL isoforms are closely related proteins of approximately 165,000–175,000 Daltons that are homologous to each other over their entire lengths. Hydrophobicity plots suggest that all three proteins are serpentine receptors with seven transmembrane regions (TMRs) and large extra- and intracellular sequences (data not shown). Pairwise comparisons between the sequences show that they are similarly related to each other, with an overall sequence identity of 54–63%. The extracellular domains and the transmembrane regions exhibit the highest degree of identity, whereas the intracellular sequences are more variable. Data bank searches identified human and mouse ESTs encoding the CLs whose sequences are highly homologous to the rat sequences, suggesting that all three isoforms are evolutionarily conserved (data not shown; see also Fig. 2). Comparisons between the sequences of multiple cDNA clones for CL1, CL2, and CL3 revealed several variations between clones (underlined in Fig. 1). These variations were probably caused by alternative splicing because they were present in independent cDNA clones and/or EST sequences. It is possible that the alternatively spliced long sequences at the C terminus of CL1 and at the N terminus of CL3 represent unspliced introns. However, this is improbable because these inserts were observed in multiple independent cDNA clones in the context of full-length sequences with open reading frames. Several of the alternatively spliced sequences include conserved regions. In two cases, different CLs appear to be alternatively spliced at the same position. CL1 and CL3 are alternatively spliced in the N-terminal extracellular domains, whereas CL2 is not. In CL1, a short sequence was either present or absent in the N terminus (KVEQK; residues 131–135). The insert-plus variant was reported in the CL1 sequence by Krasnoperovet al. (16Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and the insert-minus variant was reported by Lelianova et al. (17Lelianova V.G. Davletov B.A. Sterling A. Rahman M.A. Grishin E.V. Totty N.F. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21504-21508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although the alternatively spliced sequence is conserved among CLs, it does not appear to be alternatively spliced in CL2 or CL3. The CL3 sequence contains a large insert (residues 19–86 of CL3) at the N terminus close to the site of signal peptide cleavage. This alternatively spliced sequence is proline- and glycine-rich but otherwise unremarkable. The intracellular sequences of all three CLs are subject to alternative splicing. CL1 contains a long variable sequence at residues 1146–1190 that is not present in CL2 or CL3. In CL2, the third intracellular loop that connects the fifth and sixth TMR includes an alternatively spliced region (residues 1138 to 1153). Although we isolated no CL1 or CL3 cDNA clones with a similar variation, data bank searches revealed that human EST clones encoding CL3 exhibit similar alternative splicing. It is possible that alternative splicing of the third cytoplasmic loop is a general phenomenon of CLs. This could be functionally important because of the critical role of this cytoplasmic loop for G-protein coupling in other G-protein-linked receptors (23Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

Besides the primary product, 1-hexadecanol, the conversion of hexadecane yielded up to five additional metabolites, which were identified by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry as hexadecanal, hexadecanoic acid, 1,16-hexadecanediol, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, and 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid. As shown by substrate binding studies, the final product 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid acts as a competitive inhibitor of n-alkane binding and may be important for the metabolic regulation of the P450 activity. Kinetic studies of the individual sequential reactions revealed highV max values for the conversion of hexadecane, 1-hexadecanol, and hexadecanal (27, 23, and 69 min−1, respectively), whereas the oxidation of hexadecanoic acid, 1,16-hexadecanediol, and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid occurred at significantly lower rates (9, 9, and 5 min−1, respectively). 1-Hexadecanol was found to be the main branch point between mono- and diterminal oxidation. Taken together with data on the incorporation of 18O2-derived oxygen into the hexadecane oxidation products, the present study demonstrates that a single P450 form is able to efficiently catalyze a cascade of sequential mono- and diterminal monooxygenation reactions fromn-alkanes to α,ω-dioic acids with high regioselectivity.

The metabolic functions of P450 in these yeasts have been established thus far in the terminal oxidation of long-chain n-alkanes to fatty alcohols as the first and rate-determining step of then-alkane degradation pathway and in the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids, initiating the diterminal degradation pathway (Refs.12Käppeli O.

Sequential gene disruption revealed that in C. maltosa, four of its eight CYP52genes, namely CYP52A3, CYP52A4, CYP52A5, and CYP52A9, are directly involved in alkane assimilation (16Ohkuma M.

After heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, each of the corresponding P450 isoenzymes was found to exhibit an individual substrate specificity in terms of the preferred class (n-alkanes or fatty acids) and the chain length of the hydroxylated aliphatic compounds (17Scheller U.

In the present study, we addressed the question of whether P450 monooxygenases may be involved not only in the primary hydroxylation reactions mentioned above but also in the subsequent oxidation steps leading to the formation of fatty acids and long-chain dioic acids, which are then subjected to peroxisomal β-oxidation. For that purpose, P450 52A3,1 which represents the major alkane-inducible P450 form in C. maltosa (16Ohkuma M. Zimmer T. Toshiya I. Schunck W.-H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J.

Its substrate specificity is characterized by a preferential binding and hydroxylation of n-alkanes compared with fatty acids and by a general chain length optimum for such compounds with 16 carbon atoms (3Schunck W.-H.

Therefore, hexadecane and the putative oxidation intermediates on the way to 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid were used as model substrates, and the kinetics of their P450 52A3-catalyzed conversion and the incorporation of 18O2-derived oxygen into the products were studied. To avoid potential contaminations with other P450 forms or additional C. maltosa enzymes, P450 52A3 and the corresponding NADPH-P450 reductase were heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae, purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, and reconstituted into an active enzyme system. The results clearly demonstrate that P450 52A3 is able to catalyze the complete oxidation of n-alkanes to α,ω-dioic acids, and that this conversion is based on sequential mono- and diterminal monooxygenation reactions. [1-14C]Hexadecane, 1-[1-14C]hexadecanol, and [1-14C]hexadecanoic acid with specific activities of 57, 54, and 56.6 mCi/mmol, respectively, were purchased from either Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) or Amersham-Buchler (Braunschweig, Germany). [1-14C]Hexadecanal was produced by enzymatic oxidation of labeled 1-hexadecanol using the peroxisomal fatty alcohol oxidase from the yeast C. maltosa as described previously (14Blasig R.

Biotechnol. 1988; 28: 589-597Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 1,16-[14C]Hexadecanediol and 16-[14C]hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were prepared by the P450 52A3-catalyzed hydroxylation of labeled 1-hexadecanol in a reconstituted system composed as described below.18O2 gas (95 atom %) was purchased from Linde (München, Germany), and tert-butyl-dimethyl-chlorosilane and N-nitroso-N-methyl-p-toluenesulfonamide were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). P450 52A3 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) from C. maltosa were heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae GRF18 and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as described previously (17Scheller U. Zimmer T. Kärgel E. Schunck W.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Scheller U. Kraft R. Schröder K.-L. Schunck W.-H. J. Biol.

For identification of the hexadecane metabolites by thin layer chromatography and GC-EIMS, the reaction mixture had a final volume of 4 ml and contained 2 nmol of P450 52A3 and 8 nmol of CPR. To achieve reconstitution, both of the protein components containing 0.3% (w/v) sodium cholate from previous purification steps were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C at a P450:CPR molar ratio of 1:4 and dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C against 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer containing 20% glycerol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. The complete system contained 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 0.02% (v/v) Emulgen 913 (Kao Corp., Tokyo, Japan), 1 μmol of labeled hexadecane or 1-hexadecanol (10 μl of a 100 mm ethanolic solution with a specific radioactivity of 1–2 × 103dpm/nmol substrate), and the constituents of a NADPH-regenerating system (5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 2.8 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 3.1 mmglucose-6-phosphate). After preincubations at 30 °C for 10 min, reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 μl of NADPH (final concentration, 5 mm). After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped with 2 ml of 0.8% (v/v) H2SO4. Hydroxylation experiments under an atmosphere enriched in 18O2 were carried out as described above, except that: (i) the incubation system consisted of a vial sealed with a rubber stopper and plastic seal, and (ii) it was evacuated several times, flushed with nitrogen, and filled with18O2 from a low pressure steel flask by means of a three-way valve. After evacuation and the introduction of18O2, the reaction was started by the injection of NADPH in a solution that was previously evacuated and flushed with nitrogen. For kinetic studies on the hydroxylation of hexadecane and the individual intermediates of the hexadecane degradation pathway, the enzyme system was reconstituted from the purified protein components by the cholate dialysis method in the presence of the total microsomal phospholipid fraction of S. cerevisiae, as described previously (17Scheller U. Zimmer T. Kärgel E. Schunck W.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric titration of purified P450 52A3 with C16 substrates was performed at different substrate concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 0.50 mm, as described previously (17Scheller U. Zimmer T. Kärgel E. Schunck W.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For inhibitory studies on hexadecane binding, substrate difference spectra were also recorded in the presence of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mm1,16-hexadecanedioic acid. Experimental conditions for product extraction, separation by TLC, and determination of the enzyme activity were as described previously (17Scheller U. Zimmer T. Kärgel E. Schunck W.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For preliminary product identification, the R F values of the radiolabeled hexadecane metabolites were compared with those of authentic standards visualized with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein under UV light. For final product identification by GC-EIMS as well as the preparation of stock solutions of commercially unavailable 14C-labeled substrates, each marked spot was cut off from the TLC plate, and the corresponding product was then extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:2); the extract was evaporated, and the residue was redissolved in methanol. Before GC-EIMS analysis, the following derivatization reactions were performed: (i) methylation of hexadecanoic acid and 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid with diazomethane (22Schlenk H. Gellerman J.L. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1312-1314Crossref Scopus (879) Google Scholar), and (ii) silylation of both the methyl ester of 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid and 1-hexadecanol withtert-butyl-dimethyl-chlorosilane/imidazole reagents (23Woollard P.M. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1983; 10: 143-153Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). GC-EIMS was recorded at 70 eV with a Fisons GC 8000 quadrupole gas chromatograph coupled with a Fisons MD 800 mass spectrometer. The experiments were carried out with injector, ion source, and interface temperatures of 230 °C, 220 °C, and 250 °C, respectively. Samples in methanol (1 μl) were injected in the splitless mode and run on a capillary column (coating thickness, 60 m × 0.25 mm; 95% dimethylsiloxane cross-linked with 5% phenylmethylsiloxane, DB5 MS; J & W Scientific). The oven temperature was programmed for 2 min at 110 °C and then increased linearly to 300 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min. The carrier gas was helium. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the oxidation of hexadecane by P450 52A3 yielded five metabolites that were detectable as radioactive spots by TLC analysis and were preliminarily identified by a comparison of their R F values with those of unlabeled standards. Hexadecanol and hexadecanoic acid with R Fvalues of 0.44 and 0.57 were found as the main products. Hexadecanediol, hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, and hexadecanedioic acid withR F values of 0.18, 0.25, and 0.34 were detected as additional products. As shown in the time course (Fig. 1 B), hexadecane was initially oxidized to hexadecanol, which reached a steady-state level after about 10 min, obviously due to its further oxidation to secondary products. For identification of the hexadecane oxidation products detected by radio-TLC, the corresponding spots were extracted from the silica plate and subjected to GC-EIMS analysis. The products were identified by a comparison of their retention times and mass fragmentation pattern with those of authentic standards (Fig. 2). The major product of hexadecane oxidation, which comigrated in TLC with the hexadecanol standard, was silylated at the hydroxyl group by treatment with thetert-butyl-dimethyl-chlorosilane/imidazole reagent. The derivative showed a single peak at 17.4 min in GC-EIMS with a fragment ion of (M-57)+ at m/z 299 due to the scission at the tert-butyl group (Fig. 2 A). Selected ion monitoring carried out at m/z 299 revealed only one peak with a retention time in GC that corresponded exactly to that of the silyl derivative of the 1-hexadecanol standard (data not shown). Products of subterminal hydroxylation were not detectable, confirming the high regioselectivity of P450 52A3. The fragmentation pattern of the second major product of hexadecane oxidation, which comigrated in TLC with the hexadecanoic acid standard, is shown as methylated derivative in Fig. 2 B. After methylation, a single peak was detected in GC at 15.2 min that showed the molecular ion atm/z 270. This ion is consistent with the molecular ion of the methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid (24Blau K. Halket J. Handbook of Derivatives for Chromatography.in: Blau K. Halket J. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., London1993Google Scholar). Typical diagnostic fragments with m/z 74 (McLafferty rearrangement), 87 (γ-cleavage), 143, and 227 were also detected for both the metabolite and the authentic hexadecanoic acid standard. The formation of 1,16-hexadecanediol was verified without further derivatization by its retention time in GC (17.5 min) and its mass fragment pattern, which was identical to that of the authentic underivatized standard compound. As shown by the mass spectra (Fig. 2 D), a diagnostic fragment ion at m/z 31 was detected, indicating the cleavage of -CH2OH, which is common to primary alcohols (24Blau K. Halket J. Handbook of Derivatives for Chromatography.in: Blau K. Halket J. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., London1993Google Scholar). Although the mass spectra of underivatized 1-hexadecanol and 1,16-hexadecanediol were found to be very similar, their retention times in GC differed by more than 3 min, and they could therefore be distinguished. After silylation of the methyl ester derivative of a product comigrating in TLC with 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, this compound yielded a single peak at 20.4 min in GC. It showed strong signals of fragment ions corresponding to (M-57-32)+ at m/z 311 due to the scissions at the tert-butyl and methanol groups and (M-57)+at m/z 343 due to the scission at the tert-butyl group (Fig. 2 C). No additional fragment ions of [CH3(CH2)n-CH-O-tert-BDMS]+(n ≥ 0) were detectable by selected ion monitoring carried out for hexadecanoic acid at m/z 311 (data not shown). This demonstrated that subterminal hydroxylation did not occur with P450 52A3. The formation of 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid was verified by GC-EIMS after its conversion to dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester by its retention time in GC (17.2 min) and its mass fragment pattern, which were identical to those of the authentic standard. As shown in Fig. 2 E, typical methyl ester peaks were found at m/z 283 (M+-31) and m/z 241 (M+-73). In addition to the McLafferty fragment at m/z 74, a fragment ion at m/z 98 was detected, which is specific for long-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid dimethyl esters (25Benz W. Henneberg D. Benz W. Massenspektrometrie Organischer Verbindungen. Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft Geest & Portig K.-G., Leipzig, East Germany1969: 181-186Google Scholar). As shown above, P450 52A3 is capable of catalyzing sequential mono- and diterminal oxidation steps on an n-alkane substrate. To determine the kinetic parameters of the individual reactions, all intermediates formed during hexadecane oxidation were further considered as individual substrates. Catalytic activities were determined after short reaction times (5 min) to minimize further oxidation of the products formed during the initial oxidation. The kinetic parameters obtained are shown in Table I. The data indicate that the first step of P450 52A3-catalyzed n-alkane oxidation resulting in the formation of 1-hexadecanol occurred with a highV max (27 min−1) and a comparatively low apparent K m (54 μm). The oxidation of 1-hexadecanol was catalyzed with similar efficiency (V max = 23 min−1,K m = 28 μm). Two independent prominent products were formed simultaneously within the first 5 min: (i) hexadecanoic acid, and (ii) 1,16-hexadecanediol (Fig. 1, Cand D). In addition, hexadecanal was detected in trace amounts by TLC analysis (Fig. 1 C). Its formation as a primary product of the monoterminal oxidation of 1-hexadecanol was further confirmed by GC-EIMS (see below). However, direct estimation of the kinetic parameters for the reaction of 1-hexadecanol to hexadecanal failed due to the rapid further oxidation of hexadecanal to hexadecanoic acid as the corresponding secondary product (V max = 69 min−1; Table I). TheV max values of the further oxidation of hexadecanoic acid and 1,16-hexadecanediol to form the common product 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid were almost identical but were significantly lower when compared with those of the prior oxidation steps (about 9 min−1). However, the correspondingK m values (94 and 66 μm for hexadecanoic acid and 1, 16-hexadecanediol) indicated a kinetically slightly favored oxidation of hexadecanediol to hydroxyhexadecanoic acid. The lowest V max value (4.7 min−1) and the highest apparent K m (126 μm) were estimated for the oxidation of 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid to 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid as the final product, which itself is not subjected to further oxidation. A putative carboxyaldehyde intermediate was not detected, obviously due to its rapid further oxidation.Table IKinetic constants for the conversion of the individual intermediates formed during the P450 52A3-catalyzed hexadecane oxidation cascadeSubstrateV max(min−1)K m (μm)Primary productHexadecane27.3 ± 1.754.5 ± 1.71-Hexadecanol1-Hexadecanol22.7 ± 0.128.2 ± 1.0Hexadecanal and 1,16-HexadecanediolHexadecanal69.4 ± 4.066.9 ± 12Hexadecanoic acidHexadecanoic acid9.4 ± 0.393.8 ± 2316-Hydroxyhexadecanoic acid1,16-Hexadecanediol8.8 ± 1.765.5 ± 2516-Hydroxyhexadecanoic acid16-Hydroxyhexadecanoic acid4.7 ± 0.6126.4 ± 341,16-Hexadecanedioic acid1,16-Hexadecanedioic acidND1-aND, catalytic activity was not detectable.NDNo product formationThe reconstituted system contained 0.2 nmol of purified P450 52A3, 3.2 units of purified CPR, and 0.35 mg of total phospholipid extracted fromS. cerevisiae.

Catalytic activities were determined at seven different substrate concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 mm. Data obtained from duplicate titration experiments were fitted against the Michaelis-Menten equation using ENZFITcomputer software. As shown earlier (17Scheller U. Zimmer T. Kärgel E. Schunck W.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the titration of P450 52A3 with hexadecane induced strong type I spectral changes, indicating a high-affinity binding of the primary substrate to the P450 active site. In this study, 1-hexadecanol and hexadecanal were also found to be effective type I substrates for P450 52A3 withK s values of 58 and 18 μm. The addition of 1,16-hexadecanediol, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, or 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid did not induce any spectral changes. To check the possibility of inhibition of the initial steps in hexadecane oxidation caused by an accumulation of the final product, purified P450 52A3 was titrated with hexadecane in the presence of various concentrations of 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid. The resulting spectral effect was measured by means of substrate difference spectrophotometry. As shown in a double-reciprocal plot of the absorbance change ΔA 389–421 nm versus the hexadecane concentration (Fig. 3), the linear graphs obtained crossed they axis at 1/ΔA max, indicating the 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid as a competitive inhibitor of hexadecane binding. From the slope of the corresponding lines, aK i value of 74 μm was estimated. As studied in detail for the P450 52A3-catalyzed oxidation of 1-hexadecanol, product formation was completely dependent on the presence of P450, CPR, oxygen, and NADPH (TableII). The omission of any of these components as well as the replacement of NADPH by NAD resulted in no observable product formation. The addition of catalase and superoxide dismutase to the reaction mixture altered neither the catalytic activity nor the corresponding product profile, even after long-time incubation (TableII). This indicates that hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, which could be produced in the reconstituted system, were not involved in nonenzymatic reactions outside the active site of P450 52A3 during the individual oxidation steps.Table IIComponents required and the effect of catalase and superoxide dismutase on oxidation of 1-[14C]hexadecanol by P450 52A3 in a reconstituted systemReaction systemActivity [nmol × min−1 × (nmol P450)−1]Complete22.7NADPH omitted0.0NADPH replaced by NAD0.0Oxygen omitted0.0CPR omitted0.0P450 omitted0.0complete + 20 units of catalase23.4complete + 200 units of catalase22.8complete + 200 units of superoxide dismutase22.0complete + 800 units of superoxide dismutase21.5The complete reaction system was as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with 0.2 μm 1-[14C]hexadecanol as substrate.

In the other experiments, the components indicated were selectively omitted or added to the complete reaction system. Experiments performed in 18O2-enriched media were carried out to obtain further insight into the mechanism of the P450 52A3-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Three different substrates were chosen to follow 18O incorporation/retention during their oxidation by the reconstituted system: (i) hexadecane (experiment 1) to follow isotope enrichment during the first oxidation step, (ii) 1-hexadecanol (experiment 2) to examine 18O incorporation into hexadecanal and during its further oxidation to hexadecanoic acid, and (iii) 1-[18O]hexadecanol (experiment 3) to study the retention of the first 18O label. The pattern of label incorporation from an 18O-enriched atmosphere into the products of monoterminal oxidation is given in TableIII.Table IIIIncorporation of 18O into metabolites formed by P450 52A3-catalyzed monoterminal oxidation of hexadecane and 1-hexadecanolExperiment no./substrateGasRelative intensities of peaks corresponding to:1-Hexadecanol1-Hexadecanal1-Hexadecanoic acidR3-aR represents the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain.-H2COH m/z299R-H2C18OH m/z 301R-H2COm/z 29R-H2C18O m/z31R-HCOOH m/z 270R-HC18OOH m/z272R-HC18O18OH m/z 2741/Hexadecane16O2982ND3-bND, not detectable in TLC and GC-EIMS.ND9820 (R-CH3)18O21090 NDND603732/1-Hexadecanol16O2 10009820 (R-H2COH)18O2 1000583843/[18O]1-Hexadecanol3-cThis substrate represents the 18O-labeled hexadecanol product formed in experiment 1.16O2 10009550 (R-H2C18OH)18O2 100054388The 18O content of the products was determined from the peaks of the diagnostic fragment ions of the corresponding mass spectra (compare Fig. 4).3-a R represents the aliphatic hydrocarbon chain.3-b ND, not detectable in TLC and GC-EIMS.3-c This substrate represents the 18O-labeled hexadecanol product formed in experiment 1. Open table in a new tab The 18O content of the products was determined from the peaks of the diagnostic fragment ions of the corresponding mass spectra (compare Fig. 4). The extent of18O incorporation into hexadecanol was determined from the ion intensities of (M-57)+ at m/z 299 and 301, corresponding to the tert-BDMS esters of 1-[16O]hexadecanol and 1-[18O]hexadecanol after the scission of the tert-butyl group. A single oxygen atom derived from molecular oxygen was introduced into the 1-methyl group of hexadecane during the first hydroxylation step, as verified by the nearly complete transformation (90%) of the16O-containing diagnostic fragment ion at m/z299 to the 18O-containing ion at m/z 301 (TableIII; Fig. 4, A and B). Taking into account the isotope purity of the18O2 gas used (95 atom %), the results indicate that only a few isotope dilutions occurred under these experimental conditions. The formation of this aldehyde product was only detected by TLC when using 1-hexadecanol, and not hexadecane, as a substrate. Therefore, unlabeled 1-hexadecanol and 1-[18O]hexadecanol were used to follow18O2 incorporation (experiment 2) and retention (experiment 3; Table III). A comparison of the retention time and the mass fragmentation pattern in GC-EIMS to those obtained for the hexadecanal standard clearly revealed the formation of hexadecanal as a primary product of hexadecanol oxidation. Interpretation of the mass spectra shown in Fig. 4 C indicated that two fragment ions could serve to determine the extent of 18O incorporation into hexadecanal: (i) the mass fragment at m/z 29 corresponding to H-C≡O+, and (ii) the mass peak atm/z 44 due to scission at the β-bond close to the aldehyde group accompanied by a shift of one hydrogen to the oxygen-containing fragment (McLafferty rearrangement; Refs. 26Remane H. Herzschuh R. Remane H. Herzschuh R. Massenspektrometrie in der Organischen Chemie. Akademie-Verlag, Berlin1977: 80-81Google Scholar and 27Hanna J.G. Patai S. The Chemistry of the Carbonyl Group. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., London1966: 375-420Google Scholar). The mass spectra of hexadecanal formed both in the presence of18O2 from unlabeled 1-hexadecanol (experiment 2) and 1-[18O]hexadecanol (experiment 3) did not show any significant enrichment of 18O in the carbonyl group. This is indicated by the complete absence of fragment ions at m/z31 and 46, i.e. two mass units heavier (Fig. 4, Cand D). The 18O label in the residual 1-[18O]hexadecanol remained completely unchanged as detected by mass spectrum analysis after its extraction from the reaction mixture (data not shown). The results obtained from experiments 2 and 3 indicate that enzymatically formed hexadecanal is obviously rapidly hydrated in the incubation medium, and on the time scale of these experiments, the oxygen atom is completely exchanged with solvent water. Hexadecanal is further oxidized to hexadecanoic acid (Table I); also, this reaction was strictly dependent on the presence of P450, CPR, NADPH, and oxygen (data not shown). A single molecular ion at m/z 270 was shown by GC-EIMS for the methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid formed under air (Fig. 4 E), whereas hexadecanoic acid formed under18O2 (experiment 2) as well as from 1-[18O]hexadecanol (experiment 3) showed molecular ions at m/z 270 (M+), 272 (M++2), and 274 (M++4), with an averaged distribution of 57:37:5 (TableIII, Fig. 4 F). Detection of the molecular ion M++2 at m/z 272 revealed significant incorporation of one 18O atom into the carboxylic group (37 atom % excess). The extent of 18O incorporation was found to be identical in all three experiments. The molecular ion M++4 at m/z 274 revealed a very low degree of labeling of both the oxygen atoms of the carboxylic group. A reconstituted system consisting of purified recombinant P450 52A3 and CPR was used to define the enzymatic functions of this P450 with respect to the n-alkane metabolism of C. maltosa. The main result is that a single P450 enzyme can efficiently catalyze not only the terminal hydroxylation of long-chainn-alkanes and the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids as previously suggested (12Käppeli O. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 244-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schunck W.-H. Mauersberger S. Huth J. Riege P. Müller H.-G. Arch.

Biotechnol. 1988; 28: 589-597Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but also the complete sequence of mono- and diterminal oxidation steps finally yielding α,ω-dioic acids. This conclusion is based on the product pattern arising from the time course of P450 52A3-catalyzed hexadecane oxidation and the observation that each of the intermediates of the reaction cascade can serve as a separate P450 substrate. Based on the components required for the oxidation reactions and on quantitative measurements of oxygen incorporation derived from18O2 into the primary and secondary products of hexadecane oxidation, it can be proposed that all steps proceed according to a P450-catalyzed monooxygenase reaction (Fig. 5). As expected, this is clearly the case for the first hydroxylation of the terminal methyl groups, leading to the formation of 1-hexadecanol and 1,16-hexadecanediol. The subsequent formation of the aldehyde is also completely dependent on the presence of molecular oxygen, NADPH, and P450 and is assumed to proceed via a hydroxylation of the -CH2OH group to a gem-diol. Such a reaction type was clearly demonstrated for the generation of aldehydes from benzylic alcohols by P450s 2B4 and 2E1 (28Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6442-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Additional examples in which multiple P450-catalyzed hydroxylations at one carbon position should lead to gem-diol intermediates are the 14α-demethylation of lanosterol (29Aoyama Y. Yoshida Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the C-19 demethylation in estrogen biosynthesis (30Wright J.N. Akhtar M. Steroids. 1990; 55: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and, more directly related to the present study, the oxidation of (ω-n)- and of ω-hydroxy fatty acids to ketones and aldehydes by P450 102 (31Boddupalli S.S. Pramanik B.C. Slaughter C.A. Estabrook R.W. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and P450 4A1 (32Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Holmans P.L. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, direct evidence for an incorporation of oxygen from18O2 in the course of aliphatic aldehyde formation could not be obtained. This was obviously due to a rapid exchange with solvent water, which would also explain the loss of18O from the labeled hexadecanol upon further oxidation. The mechanism for the subsequent palmitic acid formation is assumed to involve a monooxygenation of the putative gem-diol to an ortho acid intermediate, followed by its dehydration and the release of the carboxylic group. The possible implication of a gem-diol as a substrate for this reaction was already postulated for the oxidation of a xenobiotic aldehyde (11-oxo-Δ8-tetrahydrocannabiol) to a carboxylic acid as catalyzed by P450 2C29 (33Watanabe K. Narimatsu S. Yamamoto I. Yoshimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2709-2711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the extent of18O incorporation into the carboxylic group was significantly lower than the theoretically expected 2:1 ratio between RCO18OH and RCOOH. The experimentally determined 1:2 ratio indicates that there is an uneven probability for the loss of either oxygen in the dehydration of the ortho acid, suggesting that this process occurs with some stereoselectivity in the P450 active site, in a similar manner to that proposed for the dehydration of nascentgem-diols (28Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6442-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The ability of P450 52A3 to efficiently catalyze an oxygenation cascade on a given n-alkane substrate provides new insights into the metabolic function of P450 monooxygenases in alkane-assimilating yeasts and leads us to propose a partially modified scheme of the alkane degradation pathway (Fig. 6). In accordance with previous models (15Mauersberger S. Ohkuma M. Schunck W.-H. Takagi M. Wolf K. Nonconventional Yeasts in Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1996: 411-580Crossref Google Scholar, 34Bühler M. Schindler J. Rehm H.J. Reed G. Biotechnology.

Eng. 1981; 19: 217-237Google Scholar), the main route of degradation should include a channeling of fatty alcohols produced by P450s in the endoplasmic reticulum to the fatty alcohol oxidase (37Mauersberger S. Drechsler H. Oehme G. Müller H.-G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 37: 66-73Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) in the peroxisomes. This process may be facilitated by the close contact of the two membrane compartments revealed by electron microscopy (38Vogel F. Gengnagel C. Kärgel E. Müller H.-G. Schunck W.-H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 285-291PubMed Google Scholar). The other oxidation steps now shown to be catalyzed by P450 could be important in providing fatty acids for lipid biosynthesis. Moreover, they allow by-passing of the peroxisomal fatty alcohol oxidase and fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (39Ilchenko A.P. Tsfasman I.M. Biokhimiya. 1987; 52: 58-65Google Scholar) in producing fatty acids and/or dicarboxylic acids for β oxidation. This, together with the multiplicity of the P450 forms (see the “Introduction”), may lead to a “complementation” of the substrate specificities of the different enzymes involved and could be the basis for the efficient growth of C. maltosa on a broad chain-length range of n-alkanes (C7 to C40). An additional feature of the new scheme is that it includes several possibilities for a metabolic regulation of P450 activities based on substrate/product competitions. As shown by the results of substrate difference spectra, the dicarboxylic acid clearly acts as a competitive inhibitor of n-alkane binding. Such end product inhibition may be an important element in controlling P450 activity and adjusting it to the rate of transport of intermediates out of the endoplasmic reticulum. We are grateful to E. Hammer and U. Stündl for support in the analysis of the hexadecane metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We also thank Dr. K. Ruckpaul and Dr. M. J. Coon for critical reading of the manuscript. In particular, we are indebted to Dr. M. J. Coon for help in interpreting the oxidation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2118817852,"Aerolysin is secreted as an inactive dimeric precursor by the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila. Proteolytic cleavage within a mobile loop near the C terminus of the protoxin is required for oligomerization and channel formation. This loop contains the sequence KVRRAR432, which should be recognized by mammalian proprotein convertases such as furin, PACE4, and PC5/6A. Here we show that these three proteases cleave proaerolysin after Arg-432 in vitro, yielding active toxin. We also investigated the potential role of these enzymes in the in vivo activation of the protoxin. We found that Chinese hamster ovary cells were able to convert the protoxin to aerolysin in the absence of exogenous proteases and that activation did not require internalization of the toxin. The furin inhibitor alpha1-antitrypsin Portland reduced the rate of proaerolysin activation in vivo, and proaerolysin processing was even further reduced in furin-deficient FD11 Chinese hamster ovary cells. The cells were also less sensitive to proaerolysin than wild type cells; however, transient transfection of FD11 cells with the cDNA encoding furin conferred normal sensitivity to the protoxin. Together these findings argue that furin catalyzes the cell-surface activation of proaerolysin in vivo."

Under those conditions, the tripartite sensor kinase ArcB undergoes autophosphorylation at the expense of ATP and subsequently transphosphorylates its cognate response regulator ArcA through a His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay pathway. In this study we used various combinations of wild-type and mutant ArcB domains to analyze in vitro the pathway for signal decay. The results indicate that ArcA-P dephosphorylation does not occur by direct hydrolysis but by transfer of the phosphoryl group to the secondary transmitter and subsequently to the receiver domain of ArcB. This reverse phosphorelay involves both the conserved His-717 of the secondary transmitter domain and the conserved Asp-576 of the receiver domain of ArcB but not the conserved His-292 of its primary transmitter domain.

Signal transduction by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cellular proteins plays pivotal roles in regulating numerous cellular processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, signaling by phosphoryl group transfer reactions depends on two-component systems typically comprising a sensor kinase and its cognate response regulator (1Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, the sensor kinase undergoes ATP-dependent autophosphorylation at a conserved histidine. The kinase then activates its cognate response regulator by transphosphorylating it at a conserved aspartate. Often, the kinase exhibits a third activity that promotes the release of Pifrom the phospho-response regulator. Such two-component systems have also been found in archaebacteria (2Rudolph J.

The Arc (anoxic redox control, formerly aerobic respiration control) two-component system of Escherichia coli consists of ArcB as the membrane-bound sensor kinase and ArcA as its response regulator (Fig. 1). This system regulates the expression of some 30 operons (the Arc modulon) in response to redox conditions of growth (10Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Results from a previous in vitro study on the Arc system indicated that, following ArcB autophosphorylation at the conserved His-292 of H1, the phosphoryl group is successively transferred to the conserved Asp-576 of D1, the conserved His-717 of H2, and the conserved Asp-54 of ArcA in a His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay (24Georgellis D.

So far most studies on these signal transduction pathways have focused on the ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of the sensor kinase and the subsequent phosphotransfer reaction(s) to the response regulator. Considerably less is known about the pathways for signal decay that are equally important in adaptive responses. Here we report experiments designed to analyze the route of ArcA-P dephosphorylation. The results led us to propose a novel pathway for signal decay. E. coli M15 and plasmids pREP4 and pQE30 were obtained from Qiagen Ltd. Plasmids pQE30ArcB78–778, pQE30ArcB78–661, pQE30ArcB78–520, pQE30ArcB521–778, pQE30ArcB521–661, pQE30ArcB638–778, and pQE30ArcA, used for expression of His-tagged derivatives of ArcB and ArcA, have been described previously (24Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To create pQE30ArcA′, a 440-base pair region of DNA containing the coding sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 1–136 of ArcA was amplified by the PCR1 using primers 5′-CCCGGATCCCATATGCAGACCCCGCACATTCTTATC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGATCCTGCAGTCATTAGCTTTCAACGCTACGACGTTCTTC-3′ with pMW2 (10Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1888-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) as template. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and PstI, and the resulting fragment was cloned between theBamHI and PstI sites of pQE30. To create pQE30ArcB521–778, D576A, primers 5′-CCCGGATCCCATATGCCTTTACCGGCGCTGAATGTGC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGATCCATGCATCGCGCACCCCGGTCTAGCC-3′ were used in the PCR with pBB35 (12Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The PCR product was digested withBamHI and NsiI and cloned between theBamHI and PstI sites of pQE30. To create pQE30ArcB521–778, H717Q the mutagenic primer 5′-GGCATTGTTGAGGAAGGACAGAAAATTAAAGGTGCGGCG-3′ and primer 5′-CCCGGATCCATGCATCGCGCACCCCGGTCTAGCC-3′ were used in the PCR with pBB25 (12Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The product of this reaction was purified and used as a megaprimer for PCR in combination with primer 5′-CCCGGATCCCATATGCCTTTACCGGCGCTGAATGTGC-3′ and pBB25 as template. Finally, the product of the second PCR reaction was digested withBamHI and NsiI and cloned between theBamHI and PstI sites of pQE30. All DNA fragments cloned from PCR-amplified material were verified by sequencing at Micro Core Facility of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School. Expression and purification of the His6-tagged proteins were described previously (24Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of His6-ArcA1–136 (∼0.4 nmol) was carried out at 25 °C in 20 μl of buffer A (33 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing His6-ArcB78–778 (∼50 pmol) and 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 2 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). After 10 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 3% Triton X-100). His6-ArcB78–778 was separated from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration, using a Nanosep 30K device (Pallfiltron). The filtrate, containing His6-ArcA1–136-P was passed through a Nanosep 10K device, and the retained material was washed 4 times with 500 μl of buffer B and once with 500 μl of buffer A to remove small molecules such as ATP and Pi. Finally, the retained material containing His6-ArcA1–136-P (essentially free of His6-ArcB78–778, nonhydrolyzed ATP and Pi) was diluted to a final volume of 200 μl with buffer A. Dephosphorylation reactions were carried out at 25 °C in mixtures of 35 μl of buffer A, containing ∼50 pmol of His6-ArcA1–136-P and ∼5 pmol of ArcB78–778 or its subdomain(s). At various time points, a 5-μl sample was withdrawn, mixed with 5 μl of SDS sample buffer, and kept on ice. One μl of each sample was analyzed for Pi by TLC in 2 n formic acid and 0.5m LiCl for 45 min, using polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Aldrich). The rest of the sample (9 μl) was analyzed for the proteins by SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels. The radioactivity of proteins or Pi resolved on SDS gels or TLC plates was determined qualitatively by autoradiography with X-Omat AR (Kodak) and quantitatively by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To test whether ArcB catalyzes the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P, we carried out an exploratory experiment in which His6-ArcB78–778 (hereafter referred to as H1-D1-H2) and His6-ArcA (hereafter referred to as ArcA) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. An N-terminally truncated ArcB was used because the removal of the two transmembrane segments facilitated the purification of the protein which is constitutively active as an autokinase (24Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 min of incubation, the reaction mixture was divided into 2 aliquots as follows: one served as the control and the other was fortified with additional H1-D1-H2 (Fig. 2). In the control reaction, the amount of ArcA-P continued to increase until it reached a steady state. By contrast, in the reaction mixture supplemented with H1-D1-H2, the amount of ArcA-P decreased rapidly. Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated H1-D1-H2 in the second reaction mixture increased transiently. This increase may reflect either the autophosphorylation of the added protein or its transphosphorylation by ArcA-P. The radioactivity lost from ArcA greatly exceeded that acquired by H1-D1-H2. The difference is essentially accounted for by the Pi liberated (not shown). The results suggest that ArcB catalyzes both the phosphorylation of ArcA and the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P. Efforts to isolate ArcA-P for direct assays of its dephosphorylation were unsuccessful due to its tendency to aggregate during the purification process. Since a previous study showed that the response regulator NtrC, possessing only its N-terminal receiver domain, retained the activity as a substrate of the cognate sensor kinase (32Keener J. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we used a similar approach to bypass our problem. His6-ArcA1–136 (hereafter referred to as ArcA′), containing the receiver domain but lacking the HTH (DNA binding) domain, was prepared. The purified ArcA′ was indeed found to be an effective substrate for phosphorylation when incubated with H1-D1-H2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The product, ArcA′-P, was separated from H1-D1-H2, ATP, and Pi and used as substrate for testing the phosphatase activity of ArcB or its subdomains. We used H1-D1-H2 and its modular derivatives to test the ArcA-P dephosphorylating activities, since in a previous study on signal transmission, these polypeptides were found to be catalytically active (24Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ArcA′-P was first tested for the intrinsic stability of its phospho-aspartyl bond. When incubated in buffer A (pH 7.5) at 25 °C, the half-life of the phospho-protein was found to exceed 1 h (Fig. 3 A). Incubation of ArcA′-P with purified H1-D1-H2 resulted in a rapid release of Pi with concomitant loss of radiolabel from ArcA′-P. During the course of this reaction, there was a slight transient rise of labeled H1-D1-H2 followed by a gradual decay, suggesting that the phosphoryl group was transferred from ArcA′-P to H1-D1-H2 and subsequently to H2O (Fig. 3 B). Attempts were then made to locate the dephosphorylating activity in H1-D1-H2 by the use of its various modular derivatives. The possibility of the phosphatase activity residing in H1 (His6-ArcB78–521) was first tested by incubating this domain with ArcA′-P. No dephosphorylating activity was detected (Fig. 3 E). H1-D1 (His6-ArcB78–661) also had no effect on the stability of ArcA′-P (Fig. 3 D). Moreover, neither H1 nor H1-D1 acquired the phosphoryl group from ArcA′-P at a detectable level. By contrast, D1-H2 (His6-ArcB521–778) catalyzed the hydrolysis of ArcA′-P at a rate similar to that by H1-D1-H2 and became transiently labeled itself (Fig. 3 C). When D1 (His6-ArcB521–661) or H2 (His6-ArcB638–778) was tested separately, no ArcA′-P dephosphorylating activity was observed (Fig. 3, Fand G). A mixture of the two proteins, however, did (Fig. 4 A). The rate was equivalent to that catalyzed by the covalently linked D1-H2 (compare with Fig. 3 C). Thus D1 and H2 each provides an essential catalytic function for the ArcA′-P dephosphorylation process. Because of the similarity in molecular weights of D1, H2, and ArcA′, this experiment could not reveal whether or not D1 or H2 acquired the phosphoryl group from ArcA′-P. To probe whether both His-717 of H2 and Asp-576 of D1 are critical in the concerted process of ArcA′-P dephosphorylation, a mixture of D1D576A and H2 or a mixture of D1 and H2H717Qwas tested. Neither exhibited any significant phosphatase activity (Fig. 4, B and C). To answer the question of whether the order of phospho-transfer was from ArcA′-P to H2 and then to D1, mutant D1-H2 proteins were used, since they could be separated from ArcA′-P. When ArcA′-P was incubated with D1D576A-H2, the phosphoryl group was transferred to the mutant protein, and the radiolabel lost from ArcA′-P was accounted for by the radiolabel gained by D1D576A-H2. By contrast, when ArcA′-P was incubated with D1-H2H717Q, the mutant protein did not receive any phosphoryl group. As expected, neither mutant protein catalyzed the release of Pi (Fig. 5). It thus appears that ArcA′-P dephosphorylation proceeds in the reverse direction of the His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay (24Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that H1 is dispensable. It has been reported that ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analogs accelerate the dephosphorylation of the response regulators by their orthodox cognate sensors, namely NtrB (32Keener J. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 33Ninfa A.J. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14509-14514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of ATP, ADP, AMP-PMP, ATPγS, and GTP on the dephosphorylation of ArcA′-P by H1-D1-H2. No significant effect was observed (data not shown). In a previous study on ArcB128–778, physiological concentrations (mmrange) of d-lactate, acetate, or pyruvate were found to accelerate the rate of autophosphorylation, heighten the peak phosphorylation level, and slightly retard the rate of Piloss from the kinase protein. Because the intracellular levels of these compounds were known to be elevated during anoxia, it was suggested that they serve as input signals by retarding the autophosphatase activity of ArcB (37Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we tested the influence of those metabolites on the ArcA′-P dephosphorylating activity of H1-D1-H2 and D1-H2, none of them showed any significant effect on either the rate of ArcA′-P decay or Pi release (data not shown). Preliminary experiments indicated that these effectors act on the kinase phosphorelay pathway. 2D. Georgellis, unpublished data. Several modes for signal decay seem to have evolved for the two-component systems. The rate of dephosphorylation of a response regulator appears to be controlled by the inherent lability of the mixed anhydride phospho-aspartyl bond and/or a phosphatase-like activity embodied in the cognate sensor kinase or another protein. The rate of spontaneous hydrolysis may be intrinsically set by the protein structure, since the half-life of the phospho-response regulators vary from seconds to hours (Ref. 38Wright G.D. Holman T.R. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5057-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and references therein).

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5057-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) is not essential for the dephosphorylating activity. Another class of phospho-response regulator dephosphorylations involve a third protein. Examples include the Ntr and Che systems of E. coli and the Kin/Spo phosphorelay system of B. subtilis. The dephosphorylation of NtrC-P by NtrB is controlled by the protein PII (33Ninfa A.J. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the dephosphorylation of SpoOA-P (the terminal receiver domain) is catalyzed by SpoOE (53Ohlsen K.L. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the dephosphorylation of SpoOF-P (the intermediate receiver domain) is catalyzed by a family of Rap (responseregulator aspartate phosphatases) proteins (54Perego M.

From the mechanistic point of view, the dephosphorylation by sensor kinases or other proteins may involve either their direct participation in the hydrolytic reaction or their allosteric binding to the cognate phospho-response regulator, resulting in destabilization of the phosphoryl bond (50Sanna M.G. Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 57Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-52Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to resolve this issue. Yet another mode of signal decay emerged from our in vitrostudy on ArcA-P dephosphorylation by the ArcB tripartite kinase: Pi release through a reverse phosphorelay (Fig. 6). The relatively long half-life of ArcA-P (>1 h) seems to render its spontaneous hydrolysis as an insignificant factor in signal decay. Instead, before the phosphoryl group is hydrolyzed, it needs to be transferred from ArcA-P to H2 at the conserved His-717 and subsequently to the conserved Asp-576 of D1. This conclusion is supported by in vivo studies involving plasmid-borne wild-type or mutant ArcB domains. 3D. Georgellis and O. Kwon, unpublished data. However, the possibility of additional dephosphorylation pathways catalyzed by unknown proteins cannot be excluded. It is noteworthy that H1, the classical transmitter domain, plays no apparent role in the dephosphorylation process of ArcA-P. Despite the previous observation that H1 transphosphorylated ArcA at a relatively low rate (24Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is unable to accept a detectable amount of the phosphoryl group from ArcA-P, possibly because of an unfavorable equilibrium constant. It was originally suggested that the primary transmitter of ArcB serves as the direct phosphoryl group donor for ArcA (12Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the secondary transmitter is involved in cross-talk with a hypothetical response regulator(s) (13Tsuzuki M. Ishege K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Ishige K. Nagasawa S. Tokishita S.-I. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5195-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies showed that in vitro H2 is more effective than H1 in transphosphorylating ArcA (24Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that in vivo both may serve as phosphoryl group donors, depending on the regulatory inputs (58Matsushika A. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3973-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study of BvgA/S and EvgA/S demonstrated that the specificity of the phosphorelay is mediated by the secondary, rather than the primary, transmitter domain (28Perraud A.-L. Kimmel B. Weiss V. Gross R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, a sixA(signal inhibitory factor-X) gene was discovered to encode a phosphatase that is active on the His-717-P of ArcBH292L, D576Q but not on the His-273-P of an N-terminally truncated version of EnvZ (59Ogina T. Matsubara M. Kato N. Nakamura Y. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A specific physiological role of SixA on the Arc signal transduction system, however, remains to be shown. In the BvgS/A system, the phosphorylated receiver domain of BvgS has been shown to reversibly transphosphorylate the secondary transmitter or to undergo spontaneous hydrolysis (60Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33176-33180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although not demonstrated, the dephosphorylation of BvgA-P is likely to occur through a reverse phosphorelay (Asp → His → Asp), as in the case of ArcA-P. Indeed, such a multi-step dephosphorylation pathway may apply to all two-component systems comprising a tripartite sensor kinase. An advantage of a multi-step phosphorelay network may be the availability of different rate control points for signaling, as illustrated by the Kin/Spo system (52Perego M. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 53Ohlsen K.L. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the Arc system, it has been suggested that the ArcB autophosphatase activity is regulated at the receiver domain by several fermentative metabolites, such asd-lactate (37Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study with modular ArcB units, however, failed to confirm any inhibiting effect ofd-lactate on the various steps of ArcA-P dephosphorylation. In any event, the receiver domain seems to play a pivotal role in directing the phosphoryl group reversibly to His-717 or irreversibly to H2O. A challenge therefore remains to pinpoint the action of the effectors and to determine whether there are additional elements that influence signal transmission and signal decay."
https://openalex.org/W2087468051,"Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) binds phenolic ligands forming long wavelength (500–800 nm) charge-transfer complexes. The enzyme is reduced by NADPH, and oxygen, quinones, and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones can act as electron acceptors to complete catalytic turnover. Solution of the crystal structure of OYE1 from brewer's bottom yeast (Fox, K. M., and Karplus, P. A. (1994) Structure 2, 1089–1105) made it possible to identify histidine 191 and asparagine 194 as amino acid residues that hydrogen-bond with the phenolic ligands, stabilizing the anionic form involved in charge-transfer interaction with the FMN prosthetic group. His-191 and Asn-194 are also predicted to interact with the nicotinamide ring of NADPH in the active site. Mutations of His-191 to Asn, Asn-194 to His, and a double mutation, H191N/N194H, were made of OYE1. It was not possible to isolate the N191H mutant enzyme, but the other two mutant forms had the expected effect on phenolic ligand binding, i.e. decreased binding affinity and decreased charge-transfer absorbance. Reduction of the H191N mutant enzyme by NADPH was similar to that of OYE1, but the reduction rate constant for NADH was greatly decreased. The double mutant enzyme had an increased rate constant for reduction by NADPH, but the reduction rate constant with NADH was lower by a factor of 15. The reactivity of OYE1 and the mutant enzymes with oxygen was similar, but the reactivity of 2-cyclohexenone was greatly decreased by the mutations. The crystal structures of the two mutant forms showed only minor changes from that of the wild type enzyme."

PMA (5 nm) reduced the GABA response in oocytes expressing the α1β2γ2L receptor construct, as measured by the two-electrode voltage-clamp method. GABA responses declined to approximately 25% of their pretreatment value within 45 min. GABA responses in oocytes expressing a receptor construct from which the known PKC phosphorylation sites were absent, α1β2(S410A), were comparably inhibited. Phorbol 12-monomyristate (PMM; 5 nm), which does not activate PKC, did not alter the GABA response in either construct, while the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (0.5 μm) prevented the PMA effect. To further investigate PMA inhibition of the GABA response, a GABAAreceptor α1 subunit/green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera (α1GFP) was used to visualize GABAA receptor distribution. Similar to the wild type constructs, PMA robustly decreased GABA responses in oocytes expressing α1GFPβ2γ2L and α1GFPβ2(S410A) receptor constructs. Following PMA treatment, GFP fluorescence in the oocyte plasma membrane was decreased to approximately 45% of the pretreatment values indicating GABAA receptor internalization. This effect of PMA was prevented by calphostin C and was not produced by PMM. Experiments with bd24, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes an extracellular epitope of the α1 subunit, were used to demonstrate that PMA, but not PMM, decreases α1 subunit immunoreactivity in the plasma membrane of intact oocytes expressing the α1β2γ2L construct, thus confirming the results obtained with the chimeric receptor. It is concluded that, in Xenopusoocytes, PMA induces an internalization of the GABAAreceptor through PKC-mediated phosphorylation of an unidentified protein(s) and that this contributes to the decrease in electrophysiological responses to GABA following PKC activation.

Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1116-1123PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that activation of PKC inhibits GABAA receptor function. In contrast, catalytically active PKC increases GABA responses in fibroblasts expressing recombinant GABAAreceptors (17Lin Y.-F. Browning M.B. Dudek E.M. Macdonald R.L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1424-1431Google Scholar). The basis of these contradictory findings has not been resolved. The mechanism by which PKC activation inhibits GABAAreceptor function in Xenopus oocytes remains to be fully explained. Phorbol esters decrease GABAA receptor responses in both A293 cells and Xenopus oocytes expressing rat wild type receptor constructs but not corresponding mutant constructs lacking known PKC phosphorylation sites (6Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In contrast, in oocytes expressing mouse receptor constructs, PMA inhibits both wild type receptor constructs and also constructs that contain PKC phosphorylation site mutations (15Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that, under some experimental conditions, PKC-mediated inhibition of GABA responses may be due to: 1) phosphorylation of the receptor on unidentified sites, 2) phosphorylation of receptor-associated proteins, or 3) alteration of PKC-dependent processes within the oocyte, which may decrease GABA responses. In the current set of experiments, the effect of PKC activation on the function and plasma membrane distribution of recombinant human GABAA receptor constructs expressed in Xenopusoocytes was investigated using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique and confocal microscopy. Our results demonstrate that PMA causes GABAA receptor internalization by a mechanism that is PKC-dependent but does not involve phosphorylation of the known PKC phosphorylation sites on the receptor. Furthermore, receptor internalization occurs concurrently with the decrease in GABAA receptor function observed following PMA treatment. Female Xenopus laevis were purchased from Xenopus I (Ann Arbor, MI). Drugs and reagents were obtained from the following sources: GABA and THDOC (3α, 21-dihydroxy-5 α-pregnan-20-one), Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA); propofol, Aldrich; calphostin C, Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); monoclonal anti-α1 subunit antibody (bd24), Boehringer Mannheim; Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The β2 subunit mutant, β2(S410A) was constructed using polymerase chain reaction methodology by National Biosciences (Plymouth, MN) and was confirmed by sequencing. For this construct serine 410 was replaced with an alanine. The GABAA receptor α1 subunit GFP chimera was constructed using the F64L S65T GFP variant. For this construct, GFP was fused to the C terminus of the α1 subunit as described elsewhere. 2Bueno, O., Robinson, L. C., Alvarez-Hernandez, X., and Leidenheimer, N. J. (1998) Mol. Brain Res. 59,165–177. GABAA receptor subunit cDNAs (in the pCDM8 vector) were obtained originally from Dr. Paul Whiting (Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories). All other chemicals and drugs were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma. PMA, PMM, calphostin C, and THDOC were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), stored at −20 °C at stock concentrations, then diluted to working concentrations with ND96. The Me2SO concentration in working solutions was ≤0.1%. Propofol was dissolved in ethanol, then diluted to working concentration with ND96. The final ethanol concentration was 0.05%. Oocytes were isolated from mature female X. laevis anesthetized in a cold 0.2% tricaine solution as described previously (16Leidenheimer N.J. Chapell R. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 52: 173-181Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Following a topical application of lidocaine (4%), a small abdominal incision was made and a portion of the ovary was removed. Individual oocytes were separated by placing small pieces of ovary in a solution of 83 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing collagenase type 2A (2 mg/ml), for 3 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Defolliculated oocytes were placed in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and the oocyte nucleus was injected with cDNAs encoding human GABAA receptor subunits (30 nl of sterile H2O containing 0.5 ng of cDNA/subunit). Injected oocytes were maintained at room temperature in ND96 supplemented with 2 mm pyruvate, 0.5 mmtheophylline, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments were performed as described previously (16Leidenheimer N.J. Chapell R. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 52: 173-181Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At least 24 h following injection, oocytes were placed in a perfusion chamber (100 μl volume) and perfused with ND96 at a rate of either 5 or 1 ml/min as indicated. Cells were voltage-clamped at −60 mV with a model OC-725B Oocyte Clamp (Warner Instruments Corp., Hamden, CT) using two glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl (resistance 0.5–1.5 megohms). GABA responses were recorded using a chart recorder, and peak current amplitudes were measured. Oocytes were perfused with GABA (10 μm), THDOC (10 μm), propofol (100 μm), or pentobarbital (300 μm) until the peak current amplitude of the response was obtained. THDOC, propofol, and pentobarbital were perfused at 10-min intervals, while GABA was perfused at either 5- or 10-min intervals. Each experiment was begun after three successive responses to the agonist did not vary by more than 10%. Differences between treatment groups were analyzed by a Student's t test using InStat 2.0. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. PMA or PMM (5 nm in 0.1% Me2SO) was perfused for 10 min beginning 5 min after a stable agonist response. The beginning of phorbol ester perfusion is defined as 0 min in all experiments, and agonist application following PMA treatment was begun 5 min after the cessation of the 10-min PMA perfusion. Response of the receptor to agonist was assessed for a period of 1 h following phorbol ester treatment. The perfusion rate was 5 ml/min, except for experiments in which calphostin C was used. Because of the expense of continuous perfusion with calphostin C, the perfusion rate was 1 ml/min for these experiments. The change in perfusion rate did not alter the effect of PMA in the absence of calphostin C. In antagonism experiments, oocytes were perfused with 0.5 μm calphostin C in 0.05% Me2SO for 30 min prior to PMA treatment, during which time responses to GABA (10 μm) were assessed at 5-min intervals. GABA solutions for these experiments also contained 0.5 μm calphostin C. After the 30-min perfusion with calphostin C, oocytes were perfused with 5 nm PMA + 0.5 μm calphostin C (final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO) for 10 min. Oocytes were then perfused continuously with calphostin C for an additional 35 min, and GABA (10 μm) responses were assessed in the presence of calphostin C (0.5 μm) at 5-min intervals. The effect of phorbol esters on GFP fluorescence in the oocyte plasma membrane was assessed in oocytes expressing α1GFPβ2γ2L or α1GFPβ2(S410A) receptor constructs using confocal microscopy. For these experiments, a repeated measures design was utilized such that the GFP fluorescence of each oocyte was assessed before and after treatment. Oocytes were individually incubated for 10 min in 2 ml of ND96 containing either PMA (5 nm) or PMM (5 nm). Following this treatment, oocytes were individually rinsed five times in 3 ml of ND96 and incubated another 35–55 min in ND96, and GFP fluorescence was then assessed. For antagonism experiments, oocytes were incubated in 0.5 μm calphostin C or 0.05% Me2SO for 30 min prior to PMA treatment and then incubated with PMA for 10 min in the presence of calphostin C or 0.1% Me2SO. Following PMA treatment, oocytes were rinsed in ND96 containing calphostin C or Me2SO, incubated an additional 35 min in ND96 containing calphostin C or Me2SO, and GFP fluorescence was determined. To investigate the effect of phorbol esters on the surface expression of the wild type α1β2γ2L receptor construct, intact oocytes were labeled with bd24, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope on the α1 receptor (19Ewert M. Shivers B.D. Luddens H. Mohler H. Seeburg P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2043-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Kellenberger S. Eckenstein S. Baur R. Malherbe P. Buhr A. Sigel E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These oocytes were first screened for electrophysiological responses to GABA (10 μm), and the PMM and PMA treatment groups were matched according to expression levels. Oocytes exhibiting electrophysiological responses to GABA (10 μm) of 6600–9800 nA were used. Oocytes were incubated in 20 ml of ND96 containing either PMA (5 nm) or PMM (5 nm) for 10 min. Following phorbol ester treatment, oocytes were rinsed five times with 15 ml of ND96 each rinse, and incubated in ND96 for an additional 35 min. Oocytes were then incubated in 500 μl of ND96 containing 10 μg of bd24 monoclonal anti-α1 subunit antibody for 30 min. Following this incubation, oocytes were rinsed five times in 20 ml of 4 °C rinse buffer (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Oocytes were then incubated for 1 h in 500 μl of ND96 containing 3 μg of Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG. Oocytes were again rinsed five times in rinse buffer. Surface immunofluorescence was then examined by confocal microscopy. Oocytes were imaged using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 Z confocal imaging system with a krypton/argon laser. Oocytes were placed in a specially constructed holding chamber and positioned with the equator perpendicular to the plane of imaging. Oocyte position and plane of imaging was adjusted to give maximal fluorescence of the animal pole since GABAA receptor expression is restricted to the animal pole (21Peter A.B. Schittny J.C. Niggli V. Reuter H. Sigel E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).2 GFP fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission filter set at 540 ± 30 nm. Texas Red fluorescence was measured by excitation at 568 nm, and the emission was measured at 605 ± 32 nm. A 10× (numerical aperture 0.45) objective lens was used, and the laser intensity, photomultiplier gain, and pinhole aperture were kept constant for all experiments. Images were captured using Lasersharp MRC-1024 software and analyzed using NIH Image software. Surface fluorescence was expressed as the area of the fluorescent signal of the oocyte multiplied by the mean intensity of fluorescence of the signal. PMA (5 nm) treatment of oocytes expressing the α1β2γ2L receptor construct decreased the peak amplitude of the GABA (10 μm) response to approximately 25% of the pretreatment control response by 1 h (Fig. 1 A). No effect of PMM (5 nm) treatment was observed throughout this time course. The effects of PMA (5 nm), PMM (5 nm), and PMA (5 nm) + the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (0.5 μm) on the GABA response at the 45-min time point are shown in Fig. 2 B for oocytes expressing α1β2γ2L and α1β2(S410A) receptor constructs. The α1β2γ2L receptor construct contains two PKC phosphorylation sites on the γ2L subunit and one putative PKC phosphorylation site on the β2 subunit that is homologous to that present on the β1 subunit (5Moss S.J. Doherty C.A. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α1β2(S410A) receptor construct lacks these sites. In oocytes expressing α1β2γ2L and α1β2(S410A) receptor constructs, PMA inhibited the GABA response to 27 ± 4% and 15 ± 4% (mean ± S.E., n = 7 and 6, respectively) of pretreatment GABA response. The inactive PMA analog PMM did not affect GABA responses of either receptor construct, with GABA responses of 103 ± 8% and 91.5 ± 2% (mean ± S.E., n = 6 each construct) of the pretreatment GABA response. GABA responses following PMA treatment were significantly different from those in the PMM treatment group (p ≤ 0.0001, unpaired t test). In the presence of calphostin C, PMA treatment of oocytes expressing α1β2γ2L and α1β2(S410A) receptor constructs resulted in GABA responses that were 86 ± 7% and 77 ± 3% (mean ± S.E., n = 3 each construct), respectively, of the pretreatment GABA responses. For each construct, GABA responses following PMA treatment in the presence of calphostin C were significantly different from responses following treatment with PMA alone (p ≤ 0.0001, unpairedt test).Figure 2PMA inhibition of GABA responses in oocytes expressing α1GFPβ2γ2L or α1GFPβ2(S410A) receptor constructs. Oocytes were treated with PMM (5 nm;n = 6 each construct), PMA (5 nm;n = 9, 6), or PMA (5 nm) + calphostin C (0.5 μm; n = 3, 5) for 10 min. Oocytes treated with PMA in the presence of calphostin C were pretreated with calphostin C for 30 min prior to PMA treatment, and calphostin C was present thereafter for the duration of the experiment. The GABA response average shown was collected 45 min after the onset of phorbol ester treatment and is expressed as a percentage of pretreatment GABA response (mean ± S.E.). An asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference between PMA treatment and both PMM and PMA+ calphostin C treatments in oocytes expressing the same receptor construct (p ≤ 0.0005, unpaired ttest).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PMA inhibition of GABA responses was also observed in oocytes expressing constructs containing the α1 subunit/GFP chimera (Fig. 2). This chimera has been previously characterized in Xenopusoocytes and shown to function in a manner indistinguishable from wild type receptors with respect to receptor desensitization, agonist potency, allosteric modulation and rectification.2 GABA responses in oocytes expressing α1GFPβ2γ2L or α1GFPβ2(S410A) receptor constructs were reduced to 17 ± 3% and 9 ± 5% (mean ± S.E., n = 9 and 6, respectively), of pretreatment GABA responses 45 min following PMA treatment. PMM treatment of oocytes expressing these receptor constructs yielded GABA responses at 45 min which were 108 ± 7% (α1GFPβ2γ2L) and 88 ± 2% (α1GFPβ2(S410A)) (mean ± S.E.,n = 6 each construct) of the prePMM GABA responses. For each chimeric construct tested, GABA responses in the presence of PMA were significantly inhibited when compared with GABA responses in the presence of PMM (p ≤ 0.0001, unpaired ttest). In the presence of calphostin C, PMA treatment in oocytes expressing either α1GFPβ2γ2L or α1GFPβ2(S410A) receptor constructs resulted in GABA responses that were 90 ± 7% (n = 3) and 68 ± 10% (n = 5) (mean ± S.E.) of the pretreatment GABA responses. These values were significantly different from the corresponding responses in oocytes treated with PMA in the absence of calphostin C (p ≤ 0.0005, unpaired t test). The effect of PMA on the surface expression of the GABAAreceptor/GFP chimera was investigated using confocal microscopy at a time point corresponding to maximal PMA inhibition of the GABA response (Fig. 3, A and B). The distribution of the α1GFPβ2γ2L receptor construct, as indicated by fluorescence at 509 nm, was restricted to the animal pole. No such fluorescence was observed in oocytes expressing wild type receptors (data not shown). Forty-five min after a 10-min treatment with PMA (5 nm), the presence of receptor on the oocyte membrane surface, as indicated by GFP fluorescence, was reduced to 43 ± 7% (mean ± S.E.) of pretreatment levels (pairedt test, p ≤ 0.0001, n = 18). GFP fluorescence in PMM-treated oocytes was 107 ± 9% (mean ± S.E.) of the pretreatment levels (n = 12). In the presence of calphostin C, PMA treatment resulted in fluorescence that was 112 ± 13% (mean ± S.E.) of the fluorescence present prior to PMA treatment (n = 6). Surface expression of the receptor was similarly affected in oocytes expressing the α1GFPβ2(S410A) construct (Fig. 4, A and B). PMA decreased GFP fluorescence to 45 ± 8% (mean ± S.E.) of pretreatment levels following PMA treatment (paired t test,p ≤ 0.0001, n = 16) (Fig. 4 B). GFP fluorescence in oocytes treated with PMM (5 nm) was 101 ± 16% (mean ± S.E.) of pretreatment fluorescence (n = 12). In oocytes treated with PMA in the presence of calphostin C, GFP fluorescence was 74 ± 10% (mean ± S.E.) of pretreatment levels (n = 6). There was no difference between PMM and PMA + calphostin treatment groups. Interestingly, no intracellular GFP fluorescence was observed in the oocytes under any conditions. This may be due to 1) the inability of the laser to penetrate far into a large 1 mm cell, 2) the quenching of the GFP signal by the oocyte yolk/pigment, or 3) the fact that the intracellular distribution of the GFP signal may be so diffuse that it is below detection levels. Although we cannot distinguish between these possibilities, potassium channel/GFP chimeras expressed in oocytes also show a GFP signal restricted to the plasma membrane (22Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (50) Google Scholar) similar to that observed here. In the case of the potassium channel/GFP chimera, fluorescence microscopy was performed on fixed, sectioned oocytes. Using this protocol, limited laser penetration and the quenching of the GFP signal by the yolk/pigment would have been minimized, thus supporting the possibility that the intracellular GFP signal is too diffuse for detection. To determine if PMA treatment would decrease the surface immunoreactivity of a wild type receptor construct, immunofluorescence experiments were performed on oocytes expressing the α1β2γ2L receptor construct (Fig. 5). The presence of this construct on the oocyte surface was assessed using a monoclonal antibody to an extracellular epitope of the α1 subunit (19Ewert M. Shivers B.D. Luddens H. Mohler H. Seeburg P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2043-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Kellenberger S. Eckenstein S. Baur R. Malherbe P. Buhr A. Sigel E. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Indirect anti-α1 subunit antibody immunofluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy with a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Texas Red fluorescence in oocytes treated with PMA (5 nm) was 45 ± 6% (mean ± S.E.) of that observed in oocytes treated with PMM (5 nm). This difference was statistically significant (p ≤ 0.0001, unpairedt test) and similar in magnitude to the percentage decrease in GABAA receptor observed using the GABAAreceptor-GFP chimeric construct. The GABAA receptor is allosterically modulated by a variety of compounds that have distinct binding sites on the receptor complex. At higher concentrations, many of these compounds can directly gate the chloride channel in the absence of GABA. These compounds include propofol, pentobarbital, and THDOC (23Hara M. Yoshihisa K. Ikemoto Y. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 24Peters J.A. Kirkness E.F. Callachan H. Lambert J.L. Turner A.J. Br. J.

Neuron. 1990; 4: 759-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). While the mechanisms by which these compounds directly gate the channel are not well defined, evidence exists that they activate the channel through sites distinct from the GABA-binding site (25Puia G. Santi M. Vicini S. Pritchitt D.B. Purdy R.H. Paul S.M. Seeburg P.H. Costa E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 759-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 26Turner D.M. Ransom R.W. Yang J.S.J.

If PMA induces GABAAreceptor internalization, it would predicted that PMA treatment would also decrease the direct channel-gating effects of THDOC, propofol and pentobarbital. Following PMA (5 μm) treatment, the electrophysiological responses of α1β2γ2L receptor constructs to these compounds were 5 ± 0.4%, 13 ± 6%, and 9 ± 2% (mean ± S.E.) of the prePMA responses, respectively (Fig. 6). These values were significantly different from those observed in oocytes treated with PMM (5 nm) (p ≤ 0.05, unpaired t test,n = 3 each compound). In the present study, activation of PKC by PMA decreases GABA responses in oocytes expressing α1β2γ2L and α1β2(S410A) receptor constructs, indicating that this effect is not due to phosphorylation of known PKC sites on the receptor. PMA also decreases GABA responses in oocytes expressing α1GFPβ2γ2L and α1GFPβ2(S410A) receptor constructs. The decrease in electrophysiological responses to GABA is accompanied by GABAA receptor internalization as determined using receptor-GFP chimeric constructs and immunofluorescence experiments with wild type receptor constructs. Consistent with receptor internalization, PMA also decreases the direct channel-gating effects of pentobarbital, propofol, and THDOC. A decrease in the presence of surface receptors is consistent with previous findings in Xenopus oocytes, showing that PMA decreases the efficacy of GABA (10Leidenheimer N.J. McQuilkin S.J. Hahner L.D. Whiting P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1116-1123PubMed Google Scholar, 16Leidenheimer N.J. Chapell R. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 52: 173-181Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PKC modulation of membrane protein trafficking has been demonstrated previously in Xenopus oocytes. Activation of PKC decreases the number of endogenous sodium/potassium ATPase transporters (28Vasilets L.A. Schmalzing G. Madefessel K. Haase W. Schwarz W. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 118: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and recombinant rabbit and rat sodium/glucose cotransporters (29Wright E.M. Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D.F. Zampighi G.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the plasma membrane. In contrast, PKC activation increases the number of GAT1 transporters in the plasma membrane (30Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that is dependent on the presence of a leucine heptad repeat in the GAT1 transporter (31Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activation does not affect the trafficking of all heterologously expressed proteins since RCK1 potassium channel activity is decreased by PKC without an alteration in the number of surface channels (32Peretz T. Levin G. Moran O. Thornhill W.B. Chikvashvili D. Lotan I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 1: 71-76Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The above studies suggest that PKC-mediated internalization of GABAA receptors in oocytes is not due to a general effect of PKC in stimulating internalization of surface receptors. Further evidence that PKC does not stimulate the internalization of general membrane proteins is suggested by PKC-mediated increases in the activity of NMDA receptors (33Kelso S.R. Nelson T.E. Leonard J.P. J. Physiol. 1992; 449: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34Yamakura T. Mori H. Shimoji K. Mishina M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8204-8208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the human sodium/glucose cotransporter (29Wright E.M. Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D.F. Zampighi G.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, PMA inhibited GABA responses in Xenopusoocytes expressing rat GABAA receptors. One and a half minutes after phorbol ester application, the α1β2γ2S receptor construct was inhibited by 30% while α1β2(S410A)γ2S, α1β2γ2S(S327A) or α1β2(S410A)γ2S(S327A) receptor constructs, which possess mutated PKC phosphorylation sites, were inhibited to a significantly lesser extent (15Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By 13.5 min, PMA inhibited the α1β2γ2S construct by 60%, an effect that was only slightly reduced in the α1β2(S410A)γ2S receptor construct and not at all in the α1β2γ2S(S327A) receptor construct. These data indicate that PKC-mediated inhibition of the GABAA receptor occurs in part at known PKC phosphorylation sites on the receptor but also independently of these sites. In contrast, phorbol esters inhibit GABA responses in Xenopus oocytes expressing mouse α1β1, α1β1γ2S, or α1β1γ2L GABAA receptor constructs but do not affect α1β1(S409A), α1β1(S409A)γ2S(S327A), or α1β1(S409A)γ2L(S327A, S343A) receptor constructs, indicating that PKC phosphorylation sites on the receptor mediate phorbol ester inhibition of GABAA receptors (6Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancies between studies examining phorbol ester effects on GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes is unclear. Differences in phorbol ester concentrations and treatment length may be important. Krishek et al. (6Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) treatedXenopus oocytes with PMA (250 nm) for 30–90 min (although effects were apparent within 10 min), Kellenberger et al. (15Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) treated oocytes with 10 nm PMA for 1 min every 4 min throughout the experiment, and in the present study oocytes were perfused with 5 nm PMA for 10 min. In addition to PMA protocol differences, the various studies expressed subunits from different species with rat (15Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (6Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and human (present study) subunits used. Furthermore, β1 subunits were used in the Krishek study (6Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), while β2 subunits were used here and by Kellenbergeret al. (15Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results agree more closely with those of Kellenberger et al. (15Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the same β subunit isoform was used and similar PMA concentrations and application times were employed. None of the previous studies which show that PKC activation inhibits GABAA receptors assessed whether GABAA receptor internalization may underlie the decrease in GABA response. It is possible that receptor internalization may account in part for the inhibition of GABA responses observed by Kellenberger et al.study (15Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) since, similar to the present study, PMA decreased GABA responses in oocytes expressing receptors lacking known PKC phosphorylation sites. Receptor internalization may not explain the PMA-induced decrease in receptor responsiveness observed by Krisheket al. (6Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) since PMA inhibition of GABA responses was not observed in GABAA receptors that lack PKC phosphorylation sites and therefore is different from the present results. Thus, it appears that PKC activation modulates GABAA receptor function both by a direct effect of phosphorylation on ion channel function and also by controlling the number of GABAAreceptors in the plasma membrane. Which mechanism(s) is operable in a given experiment may depend on the experimental parameters. The existence of these two distinct mechanisms may contribute to the disparate results in the literature. Although our results demonstrate that phosphorylation of previously identified PKC phosphorylation sites on the GABAA receptor are not involved in receptor internalization, we cannot rule out the possibility that there may be other phosphorylation sites on the receptor that are important. These sites may be phosphorylated either by PKC or secondarily to PKC activation by other kinases. In this regard, the GABAA receptor is phosphorylated by tyrosine kinase (36Valenzuela C.F. Machu T.K. McKernan R.M. Whiting P. VanRenterghem B.B. McManaman J.L. Brozowski S.J. Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Harris R.A. Mol.

Man H.Y. Braunton J. Wang W. Salter M.W. Becker L. Wang Y.T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5062-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase A (5Moss S.J. Doherty C.A. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (39Machu T.K. Firestone J.A. Browning M.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40McDonald B.J. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18111-18117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PMA stimulates internalization of receptor constructs lacking the γ2L subunit, phosphorylation of this subunit can be ruled out as being required for PMA-induced internalization of the receptor. Additionally, we do not rule out the possibility that, in our experiments, the receptors were phosphorylated on the known PKC phosphorylation sites but only conclude that phosphorylation of these sites is not required for receptor internalization. Although the decrease in GABAA receptor responses noted in the present study may be explained, at least in part, by receptor internalization, internalization of the receptor is unlikely to explain some of the previously reported effects of PMA treatment on recombinant GABAA receptors expressed in oocytes. In this regard, PMA treatment alters GABAA receptor desensitization (10Leidenheimer N.J. McQuilkin S.J. Hahner L.D. Whiting P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1116-1123PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increases the potentiation of GABA responses by diazepam, pentobarbital (41Leidenheimer N.J. Whiting P.J. Harris R.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and THDOC (16Leidenheimer N.J. Chapell R. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 52: 173-181Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The above effects are unlikely to be explained by receptor internalization and may be the result of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor, which alters the desensitization kinetics of the receptor and enhances allosteric coupling mechanisms. Regulation of cell surface receptor number is thought to be a mechanism by which synaptic strength is controlled. In cultured neurons, the GABAA receptor undergoes continuous cycling of insertion into the membrane and reuptake into a cytosolic compartment (42Borden L.A. Czajkowski C. Chan C.Y. Farb D.H. Science. 1984; 266: 857-859Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although we have not distinguished whether PMA stimulates GABAA receptor internalization by inhibiting receptor insertion into the plasma membrane or stimulating removal of the receptor from the plasma membrane, it seems more plausible that PMA stimulates the removal of the receptor from the plasma membrane since the former mechanism would require that the GABAA receptor population in the plasma membrane have an extremely rapid basal turnover rate. Recently, the number of GABAA receptors present in the plasma membrane of transfected cells and cultured hippocampal neurons has been shown to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (18Wan Q. Xiong Z.G. Man H.Y. Ackerley C.A. Braunton J. Lu W.Y. Becker L.E. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Nature. 1997; 388: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Insulin activation of tyrosine kinase activity induces the transport of GABAA receptors from the intracellular compartment to plasma membrane, resulting in an increased electrophysiological response to GABA. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation appears to play a role in GABAA receptor trafficking in neurons. It is possible that serine/threonine phosphorylation may also regulate neuronal GABAA receptor trafficking. In conclusion, PMA induces a PKC-mediated internalization of GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes concurrent with a decrease in the electrophysiological response to GABA. This effect was not due to the phosphorylation of any of the known PKC sites on the receptor. Additionally, our results validate the use of a GABAA receptor-GFP chimera for studying GABAA receptor trafficking in living cells. Finally, the present findings highlight the importance of considering the role of receptor trafficking in the interpretation of data obtained when studying the effects of phosphorylation on neurotransmitter receptor function.

In this study, we have examined the role of the α isoenzyme of protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of LPS-initiated signal transduction in macrophages. To this end, we have stably overexpressed a dominant-negative (DN) version of PKC-α (DN PKC-α) in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Clones overexpressing DN PKC-α were indistinguishable from the parental line with respect to morphology and growth characteristics. At the functional level, DN PKC-α overexpression strongly inhibited LPS-induced interleukin-1α mRNA accumulation, and to a lesser extent inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor-α expression. DN-PKC-α overexpression did not cause a general unresponsiveness to LPS, as secretion of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 was up-regulated in our DN PKC-α-overexpressing clones. Moreover, LPS-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, NF-κB activation, as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, were not affected by DN PKC-α overexpression. Collectively, these data provide evidence that PKC-α regulates selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation.

Mononuclear phagocytes are multipotential cells that can be modulated to perform a variety of functions including secretion of nitric oxide (NO)1 and proinflammatory cytokines, which are important mediators in host defense and inflammation. In this regards, LPS, a major component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, is one of the most potent and best characterized modulator of macrophage function. Binding of LPS to the cell surface CD14 molecule triggers multiple intracellular biochemical cascades, including the phosphorylation of several proteins by either tyrosine or serine/threonine kinases (1Wright S.D.

Although the identity of the protein tyrosine kinases that mediate LPS-initiated signal transduction remains to be determined with certainty (4English B.K. Ihle J.N. Myracle A. Yi T. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar), and experiments using various PKC inhibitors indicated that PKC activity is required for the expression of several macrophage functions, including TNF-α and IL-1 secretion, NO production, and tumoricidal activity (9Shapira L. Takashiba S. Champagne C. Amar S. Van Dyke T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1818-1824PubMed Google Scholar, 13Novotney M. Chang Z.L. Uchiyama H. Suzuki T.

Sakano T. Hamasaki T. Kashiwa H. Ueda K. Immunology. 1989; 67: 210-215PubMed Google Scholar). PKC was first characterized as a Ca2+-dependent and phospholipid-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase that requires diacylglycerol for activity (19Parker P.J. Coussens L. Totty N. Rhee L. Young S. Chen E. Stabel S. Waterfield M.D. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been established that PKC is not a single entity, but rather a family of closely related isoenzymes comprising at least 12 different members (20Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). Differences in their structure, requirement for activity, subcellular localization, and substrate specificity suggest that in a given cell, the various PKC isoenzymes may exert specific functions (20Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar, 21Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Macrophages and monocytic cells express the Ca2+-dependent isoenzymes α, βI, and βII, the Ca2+-independent isoenzymes δ and ε, and the atypical isoenzyme ζ (10Fujihara M. Connolly N. Ito N. Suzuki T. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1898-1906PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zheng L. Zomerdijk T.P.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 3981-3987PubMed Google Scholar). However, our current knowledge on their respective contribution to the regulation of macrophage function is limited and mainly concerns the regulation of nitric oxide production. In one study, differential down-regulation of PKC isoenzymes induced by phorbol ester treatment revealed that PKC-βII participates in LPS-induced iNOS gene expression and nitrite production in the J774 macrophage cell line (10Fujihara M. Connolly N. Ito N. Suzuki T. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1898-1906PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, transient PKC isoenzymes transfection studies in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line showed that iNOS gene expression is also regulated by PKC-ε, but in contrast to the pathway regulated by PKC-βII, the PKC-ε-dependent pathway is apparently not involved in the LPS response (24Diaz-Guerra M.J.M.

Elucidation of the role of a particular PKC isoenzyme in cellular regulation is complicated by the concomitant expression of several isoenzymes and by the lack of isoenzyme-specific activators or inhibitors. In the present study, we have investigated the role of PKC-α in the regulation of LPS-induced functions by overexpressing a kinase-deficient mutant of this isoenzyme in the murine macrophage line RAW 264.7. Such catalytically inactive mutants, which behaves as a dominant-negative molecule, acts by competing with the corresponding endogenous isoenzyme (21Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 25Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we obtained evidence that PKC-α activity regulates selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. The wild type human PKC-α cDNA (26Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Hug H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). A dominant-negative version of the gene, DN PKC-α (K368D), was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer System with the mutagenic primer AD-5 (5′-GTATGCAATCGATATCCTGAAGAAGG-3′), as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The sequence of this mutant was confirmed by sequence analysis. Replacement of the conserved lysine residue in the ATP-binding domain yields an enzymatically inactive trans-dominant mutant (27Rosson D. O'Brien T.G. Kampherstein J.A. Szallasi Z. Bogi K.

Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20 (; 106, 108–110): 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and the resulting construct was designated pCIN-DN PKC-α. The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (American Type Culture Collection, kindly provided by D. Oth) was cultured in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamine (Life Technologies Inc., ON, Canada), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 10 mm Hepes pH 7.3, and antibiotics (complete medium). Stable transfections were performed as described (31Stacey K.J. Ross I.L. Hume D.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected in complete medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies Inc.) and individual clones were harvested, expanded, and examined for PKC-α levels by Western blot analysis. Adherent cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Total proteins (15 μg) were fractionated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted onto Hybond-ECL membranes (Amersham Life Science Inc., ON, Canada) and immunodetection was achieved by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Life Science). Anti-PKC isoenzyme monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα was analyzed with the PhosphoPlus IκBα (Ser32) Antibody kit from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), phosphorylation of the p38 MAP kinase was determined with the PhosphoPlus p38 MAPK (Tyr182Antibody kit, New England Biolabs), and phosphorylation of the Jun N-terminal kinase was analyzed with the Anti-Active JNK pAb from Promega (Madison, WI). [3H]Phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) binding was determined as described (32Jaken S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells plated in 24-well plates were washed twice with binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.0) and incubated in the presence of 10 nm [3H]PDBu (DuPont NEN, ON, Canada) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 0.1n NaOH, and bound [3H]PDBu was measured by liquid scintillation counting. All experiments were done in triplicate determinations, in the presence (nonspecific binding) or absence (total binding) of 10 μm unlabeled PDBu (Sigma). Specific binding was the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding. RNA preparation and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (33Descoteaux A. Matlashewski G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 846-853PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that probes were radiolabeled by random priming (34Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). The TNF-α probe was the 1.5-kilobase PstI fragment from pmTNF-1 (35Fransen L. Muller R. Marmenout A. Tavernier J. Van der Heyden J. Kawashima E. Chollet A. Tizard R. Van Heuverswyn H. Van Vliet A. Ruysschaert M.R. Fiers W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4417-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), provided by W. Fiers, the IL-1α probe was the 2.0-kilobase BamHI-HindIII fragment from pmIL1A (36Lomedico P.T. Gubler U. Hellmann C.P. Dukovich M. Giri J.G. Pan Y.C. Collier K. Semionow R. Chua A.O. Mizel S.B. Nature. 1984; 312: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) probe was the 817-base pairHincII-EcoRI fragment from piNOSL3 (37Xie Q.W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A. Troso T. Nathan C. Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar) (provided by D. Radzioch). Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of LPS (Escherichia coli, strain 0127:B8, Sigma) for 18 h and the amount of nitrite released into supernatants was determined with the Griess reagent as described (38Green S.J. Meltzer M.S. Hibbs J.J. Nacy C.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 278-283PubMed Google Scholar). Adherent cells were incubated in the absence or presence of LPS for 18 h and the amounts of TNF-α and IL-1α in cell supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For TNF-α levels, a rat anti-mouse TNF-α monoclonal antibody and a biotin-labeled rat anti-mouse TNF-α monoclonal antibody (both from Cedarlane Laboratories, ON, Canada) were used. For IL-1α, a hamster anti-mouse IL-1α monoclonal antibody (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), a rabbit anti-mouse IL-1α polyclonal serum (Cedarlane, ON, Canada), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were used. Secretion of MMP-9 in cell supernatants was determined by gelatin zymography, as described previously (39Tremblay P. Houde M. Arbour N. Rochefort D. Masure S. Mandeville R. Opdenakker G. Oth D. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots from cell supernatants were fractionated by electrophoresis in a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1% gelatin (Sigma). Gels were washed to remove SDS and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in renaturing buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100). MMP-9 activity was visualized following staining/destaining of the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and was quantitated by computerized image analysis (Bio-Rad, model GS-670 Densitometer). Results were expressed as arbitrary scanning units. Adherent cells (107 per 100-mm tissue culture dishes) were stimulated with LPS for various time points, washed, and scraped into 1.5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell suspensions were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, pelleted, and the nuclear protein extracts were prepared essentially as described (40Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Protein contents were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and the extracts were stored at −70 °C. EMSA were performed by incubating 32P-labeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′, obtained from Promega) with 10 μg of nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature. The incubation mixture contained 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol). The DNA-protein complexes were separated from free oligonucleotide by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions in 4% native polyacrylamide gels in a buffer containing 44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm borate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. The specificity of binding was determined by competition with excess unlabeled oligonucleotide. After electrophoresis, gels were exposed to films at −70 °C. Stable transfectants from two independent populations of RAW 264.7 macrophages electroporated with pCIN-DN PKC-α were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. Western blot analyses were performed on three clones selected from each independent populations of transfectants to determine their PKC-α expression levels. The three clones from the first population (clones DN PKC-α B1, C2, and D1), and one clone from the second population (clone DN PKC-α A2) expressed immunoreactive PKC-α above endogenous levels (not shown). To determine whether DN PKC-α overexpression had any effect on LPS-induced responses, we measured the ability of these four DN PKC-α-overexpressing clones to secrete nitrite in response to LPS. As shown in Table I, LPS-induced nitrite secretion was inhibited in the four DN PKC-α-overexpressing clones (clones DN PKC-α B1, D1, A2, C2) with respect to the RAW 264.7 cells transfected with the empty vector. Inhibition of LPS-induced nitrite production was likely a consequence of DN PKC-α overexpression, as LPS-induced nitrite secretion in three clones of RAW 264.7 cells transfected with a construct containing the wild-type murine PKC-ζ cDNA (41Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. Mischak H. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was similar to that of RAW 264.7 cells transfected with the empty vector (clones PKC-ζ A1, A2, B1) (Table I).Table IDN PKC-α inhibits LPS-induced nitrite secretionCellsTreatment (ng/ml LPS)010100μm1-aThese values represent the mean ± S.E. of one experiment performed in triplicate samples.Exp. 1 pCIN-42.1 ± 0.544.5 ± 2.848.0 ± 2.4 DN PKC-α A23.0 ± 0.612.3 ± 1.017.5 ± 3.2 DN PKC-α C22.1 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.88.1 ± 0.9 DN PKC-α B12.3 ± 0.25.0 ± 0.68.1 ± 1.9 DN PKC-α D11.7 ± 0.110.6 ± 0.515.6 ± 3.6Exp. 2 pCIN-42.9 ± 0.714.5 ± 4.319.4 ± 2.5 PKC-ζ A13.2 ± 0.215.6 ± 1.920.4 ± 5.2 PKC-ζ A23.0 ± 0.510.4 ± 1.117.4 ± 2.9 PKC-ζ B13.2 ± 0.211.8 ± 1.219.1 ± 1.4Adherent cells (2.5 × 105 per well) were incubated in the absence or presence of either 10 or 100 ng/ml LPS for 18 h.

In Experiment 2, clones of RAW 264.7 cells transfected with a PKC-ζ construct were compared to RAW 264.7 cells transfected with the empty vector. Clone DN PKC-α A2, with a 2-fold increase in immunoreactive PKC-α levels, and clone DN PKC-α C2, with a 10-fold increase in immunoreactive PKC-α levels (Fig. 1 A), were selected for further analyses. Increased DN PKC-α levels in these clones was also demonstrated by measuring [3H]PDBu binding levels (42Knopf J.L. Lee M.H. Sultzman L.A. Kriz R.W. Loomis C.R. Hewick R.M. Bell R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), which were higher (1.3-fold for clone A2 and 2-fold for clone C2) than in the parental line (RAW 264.7 transfected with pCIN-4) (Fig. 1 B). Finally, clones A2 and C2 were similar to the parental cells with respect to their growth characteristics and morphology (not shown). Of note, we were unsuccessful, despite several attempts, in generating stable G418-resistant clones overexpressing a wild type PKC-α construct, suggesting that elevated levels of wild type PKC-α is toxic for the RAW 264.7 cells. Exposure of macrophages to LPS induces TNF-α, IL-1α, and iNOS mRNA accumulation. To assess the contribution of PKC-α in this process, we determined the levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and iNOS mRNA in RAW 264.7 control cells (transfected with the empty vector) and in the DN PKC-α-overexpressing clones A2 and C2 after LPS stimulation (10 and 100 ng/ml) for 6 h. In control RAW 264.7 cells, LPS induced the expression of these three genes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3). DN PKC-α overexpression had a minor inhibitory effect on the induction of TNF-α mRNA accumulation (20–25% reduction in clone A2 and 45 to 55% in clone C2 with respect to control cells) (Fig. 2, top panel). In contrast, LPS-induced IL-1α mRNA accumulation was reduced by 50–70% in clone A2 (Fig. 2, second panel, lanes 5 and 6) with respect to control cells (lanes 2 and 3), and abolished in clone C2 (lanes 8and 9). Finally, iNOS mRNA accumulation was reduced by 50–60% in clones A2 (Fig. 2, third panel, lanes 5 and 6) and by 65–75% in clone C2 (lanes 8 and 9) with respect to iNOS mRNA levels present in control cells (lanes 2 and 3). This inhibition can be correlated with DN PKC-α expression levels. We next compared the ability of control RAW 264.7 cells and clones A2 and C2, to produce TNF-α, IL-1α, and nitrite. In the presence of 10 and 100 ng/ml LPS, RAW 264.7 cells secreted high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and nitrite in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A-C). Secretion of immunoreactive TNF-α (Fig. 3 A) by clone A2 was similar to that of RAW 264.7 cells and was reduced by 40–50% in clone C2. Similarly, secretion of TNF-α was reduced by 55% in clone B1 and by 40% in clone D1 in response to 100 ng/ml LPS (data not shown). Consistent with the inhibition of IL-1α mRNA accumulation, clones A2 and C2 failed to produce significant IL-1α levels in response to 10 ng/ml LPS (Fig. 3 B). At 100 ng/ml LPS, IL-1α secretion was slightly increased for clone A2 and was barely above basal levels for clone C2. Similar results were obtained with clones B1 and D1, both of which failed to secrete IL-1α in response to 100 ng/ml LPS (data not shown). Nitrite secretion (Fig. 3 C) was reduced by approximately 60–70% for clone A2, and by 80–90% for clone C2 with respect to RAW 264.7 cells. Thus, DN PKC-α overexpression had a major inhibitory effect on LPS-induced IL-1α and NO production. In addition to inflammatory cytokines and nitrite, LPS stimulates macrophages to secrete various hydrolases, including the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 (43Van Ranst M. Norga K. Masure S. Proost P. Vandekerckhove F. Auwerx J. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on data obtained with PKC inhibitors, it has been proposed that PKC exerts both positive and negative regulation on LPS-induced MMP-9 secretion in macrophages (39Tremblay P. Houde M. Arbour N. Rochefort D. Masure S. Mandeville R. Opdenakker G. Oth D. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine the role of PKC-α in this process, we measured the secretion of MMP-9 in the supernatants of control cells and of clones A2 and C2 after stimulation with either 10 or 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4, MMP-9 levels were significantly higher in the supernatants of clones A2 (2-fold,lanes 7–10) and C2 (4-fold, lanes 12–15) than in the supernatants of normal cells (lanes 2–5). Of note, the reduced MMP-9 secretion by normal cells stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS (lanes 4 and 5) was not observed with clones A2 (lanes 9 and 10) and C2 (lanes 14and 15). Thus, increased LPS-stimulated MMP-9 secretion in DN PKC-α-overexpressing RAW 264.7 cells suggests that PKC-α negatively regulates MMP-9 secretion. Treatment of macrophages with LPS rapidly induces the dissociation of NF-κB from IκB and its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences (14Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 44Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). This process is initiated with IκB phosphorylation by the IκB kinase, IKK-α, on specific serine residues (45Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 46DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar), followed by its ubiquitination and degradation. To investigate whether DN PKC-α overexpression affected this pathway, we measured the kinetics of LPS-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation by immunoblotting analysis. In both control cells (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–5) and clone C2 (lanes 6–10), IκBα phosphorylation was maximal within 10–20 min following the addition of LPS. Decline in phosphorylated IκBα levels was observed between 20 and 30 min post-stimulation. Kinetics of IκBα degradation were also similar in control cells (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–5) and in clone C2 (lanes 6–10), with a sharp decline occurring between 10 and 20 min after LPS stimulation. Consistently, the kinetics of NF-κB nuclear translocation were similar in LPS-stimulated control cells and in clone C2 as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 6). Similar to clone C2, both clones B1 and D1 showed normal kinetics of LPS-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation (data not shown). Thus, DN PKC-α overexpression did not interfere with LPS-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation and with NFκB nuclear translocation in RAW 264.7 cells.Figure 6Effect of DN PKC-α overexpression on LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Adherent cells (vector alone,lanes 1–3; and clone C2, lanes 4–6) were incubated in the presence of 100 ng/ml LPS for 15 and 30 min. Cell extracts were prepared and EMSA for NF-κB were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In lane 7, 50-fold excess cold probe was co-incubated with the reaction mixture containing nuclear extracts from control cells incubated with LPS for 30 min prior to EMSA. Similar results were obtained in four different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LPS induces the signaling pathways leading to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK1/2, p38, and JNK (47Han J.

In 1990, a series of prostaglandin (PG)1 F2-like compounds termed isoprostanes F2α (iPF2α) was discovered to be produced in abundance in humans by a free radical mechanism independent of the cyclooxygenase enzyme from arachidonic acid (1Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J., II. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Formation of these prostanoids proceeds through bicyclic endoperoxide intermediates that are reduced in vivo to isoprostanes F2α. In addition, the unstable bicyclic endoperoxide intermediates (2Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) may also readily rearrange in an aqueous environment to isothromboxane (3Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Wu A. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C.

Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J., II J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4317-4326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four regioisomers for each of the D2, E2, and F2 isoprostanes are formed from arachidonic acid, each of which is comprised of 16 stereoisomers (5Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 6Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Progr. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Interest in these molecules stems not only from the fact that they have been shown to provide a valuable index of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation in vitro and in vivo but also from the finding that isoprostanes E2and F2 exert potent biological activities in mammals (6Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Progr. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). As early as the 1960s, it was shown by Nutgeren et al. (7Nutgeren D.H. Vonkeman H. Van Dorp D.A. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1967; 86: 1237-1245Google Scholar) that prostaglandin-like compounds could be formed by autoxidation of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid. Some years later Pryor et al.(8Pryor W.A. Stanley J.P. Blair E. Lipids. 1976; 11: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) autoxidized methyl linolenate and obtained mass spectra evidence for the formation of PGF-type products after reduction of the autoxidation mixture. Porter and co-workers prepared a single hydroperoxy fatty acid from γ-linolenic acid and allowed it to react in the presence of oxygen and a free radical source. After reduction, GC-MS analysis indicated the presence of a number of PGF-like compounds, one of which was identical with an authentic sample of dinor-PGF1α (9Porter N.A. Funk M.O. J. Org. Chem. 1975; 40: 3614-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanism of formation of dinor isoprostanes involves initial hydrogen abstraction from one of the two bisallylic methylene groups of α-linolenic acid at carbons 11 and 14. Two bicyclic endoperoxide regioisomeric families, each comprising 16 members, result from the subsequent reaction of the initial linolenate free radical with two oxygen molecules, where each of the isomers has a cyclopentane ring containing a cis-1,3-endoperoxide moiety. Two alkyl chains extend from the cyclopentane ring, one containing the original carboxylic acid moiety, and the second chain containing the methyl terminus (see Fig. 1). The stereochemical aspects of the formation of bicyclic endoperoxides from hydroperoxy methyl α- and γ-linolenate have been studied, and it was found that the side chains of the bicyclic endoperoxides are almost exclusively oriented cis similar to the C20 isoprostanes (10O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 223-224Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to prostaglandins formed by cyclooxygenase in which the side chains are exclusively orientedtrans. The bicyclic endoperoxide moiety of the molecules easily rearranges in the presence of water to E- and D-ring compounds having a hydroperoxy group in the side chain, which in turn may be reduced in vitro or in vivo to dinor isoprostanes E1 and D1 (see Fig. 1; see Ref. 12Rokach J.

In the present study, we demonstrate that α-linolenic acid autoxidizes readily via the 12- and 13-hydroperoxyradical intermediate to dinor isoprostanes of the E-type in aqueous buffers, a reaction that can be catalyzed by soybean lipoxygenase. Dinor isoprostanes were prepared in the mg scale and characterized by mass spectroscopy and NMR. Analytical methods were developed that allowed us to quantitate the formation of the two dinor isoprostane E1(dinor-iPE1) regioisomers in vitro by HPLC and GC-MS and to demonstrate that plants form dinor-iPE1 in vivo. Soybean lipoxygenase (L-8383, Type-I-S, 43,000 units/mg) was from Sigma. α-Linolenic acid (puriss. p.a.) was purchased from Fluka. Silica solid phase extraction columns (500 mg) were from Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany. Silica gel 60 (particle size 63–100 μm) for column chromatography was from Merck. Oxygen-18O2 gas (99.1 atom % 18O) was obtained from Isotec, Miamisburg, OH. Plant suspension cultures were obtained from the departmental culture collection and grown as described (13Parchmann S. Gundlach H. Mueller M.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Linolenic acid (6 g) was dissolved in chloroform, loaded on a silica column (10 g), and eluted with hexane/diethyl ether (9:1, v/v) to remove any contaminating oxygenated fatty acids. The eluate was taken to dryness in a 500-ml round bottom flask and dissolved in 12 ml of methanol/water (1:1, v/v). In the case of the labeling experiment, the flask was evaporated in vacuo and filled with 500 ml of oxygen-18O2 gas (99.1 atom % 18O). After stirring the mixture for 7 days at room temperature, the autoxidation reaction was stopped by the addition of 6 g of triphenylphosphine in 50 ml of chloroform. After 30 min of incubation time, 12 ml of saturated NaCl solution was added. The organic phase was evaporated in vacuo, reconstituted in 60 ml of chloroform, and loaded on a silica column (30 g of silica gel 60). The remaining linolenic acid, monohydroperoxides, and triphenylphosphine were eluted with 600 ml of diethyl ether/acetic acid (99:1, v/v) and discarded. A crude mixture of [18O]dinor-iPE1s labeled with three 18O atoms was obtained by eluting the column with 500 ml of diethyl ether/acetone/acetic acid (7:3:0.1, v/v). The eluate containing an isomeric mixture of [18O]dinor-iPE1s was quantitated by HPLC (see below) and used without further purification as the internal standard for GC-MS analysis. Unlabeled dinor-iPE1 compounds were produced analogously by using 16O2 gas. Aqueous samples containing dinor-iPE1 were obtained from autoxidation of linolenic acid (5 mg) in methanol/water or LOX-catalyzed oxidation of linolenic acid (5 mg) in borate buffer (see below). For HPLC analysis, samples were spiked with 5 μg of PGE1 as internal standard. After the addition of 0.05% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (w/v), the incubation mixture was acidified with citric acid to pH 3 and extracted with diethyl ether. The ether phase was taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in chloroform. The sample was incubated with 20 mg of triphenylphosphine to reduce peroxides to their corresponding hydroxy derivatives for 5 min and applied to a silica solid phase extraction column (500 mg). The column was washed with 9 ml of diethyl ether/acetic acid (98:2, v/v) and 3 ml of chloroform/acetone/acetic acid (8:2:0.1, v/v), thereby removing remaining fatty acids and monohydroperoxides thereof. Any isoprostane-like compounds of the B-type, if present, will also be lost during this procedure. Dinor-iPE1 compounds were eluted with 6 ml of diethyl ether/acetone/acetic acid (6:4:0.1, v/v). The eluate was taken to dryness, reconstituted in 100 μl of a solution of 0.25% BHT (w/v) in methanol, and treated with 400 μl of 1 m KOH for 10 min at 40 °C. Under these conditions, dinor-iPE1 and PGE1 undergo base-catalyzed dehydration (14Andersen N.H. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 320-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to form the corresponding B1-ring compounds (see Fig. 2). The incubation mixture was acidified with citric acid to pH 3 and extracted with diethyl ether. The diethyl ether phase was taken to dryness and analyzed by HPLC. Dinor isoprostanes B1 and PGB1 were separated on a LiChrospher 100 reversed phase18 end-capped column (5-μm particle size, 250 × 4 mm, Merck) eluted with a mixture of acetonitrile/methanol/water/acetic acid with the ratio of 24:28:48:0.01 (v/v) for 15 min and then with 30:35:35:0.01 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. UV spectra were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 1040A diode array detector. The chromatogram showed the presence of three strongly UV-absorbing compounds (λmaxat 278 nm) representing dinor-iPB1 type I and type II and the derivative of the internal standard, PGB1 (see Fig. 3). Because the dinor isoprostanes B1 contain the same chromophore as PGB1, we used the molar absorption coefficient of PGB1 (ε = 30,000 cm-1m-1) to quantitate the dinor-iPB1s.Figure 3Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of linolenate autoxidation products after base treatment. Aliquots of linolenate autoxidation mixtures were spiked with 5 μg of PGE1 and worked up as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peaks I and II correspond to dinor isoprostane B1 type I and II, respectively. The UV spectra of the compounds are shown as theinset.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a series of preparative HPLC runs, the two peaks corresponding to dinor-iPB1 type I and type II were collected and analyzed by two-dimensional NMR, which revealed unambiguously their structures (data not shown). Cells (10 g) were harvested from plant cell suspension cultures 3 days after transfer into fresh medium by suction filtration, shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and suspended in 10 ml of a saturated NaCl solution in water containing 0.05% BHT (w/v), 20 mg of triphenylphosphine, and 0.2 ml of 1m citric acid. As internal standard, a mixture of [18O]dinor isoprostanes E1 containing 100 ng of type I regioisomers and 92 ng of type II regioisomers was added. The frozen cells were broken up and extracted with 20 ml of diethyl ether using a high speed disperser. The ether phase was taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, reconstituted in 2 ml of chloroform, and further purified as described above. The sample obtained after the base-catalyzed dehydration of E-ring compounds containing the corresponding B-ring derivatives was reconstituted in chloroform and loaded on a silica solid phase extraction column. The column was washed with 3 ml of hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (2:1:0.03, v/v), and B-ring compounds were eluted from the column with 6 ml of diethyl ether/acetic acid (98:2, v/v). Because all contaminants that can be eluted from the silica column with diethyl ether/acetic acid (98:2, v/v) have been removed in the first step of purification, the diethyl ether/acetic acid (98:2, v/v) eluate of the second silica column represents a highly purified dinor-iPB1 extract. For NCI GC-MS analysis, dinor-iPB1s were converted to pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) ester and trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers as described (5Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). NCI GC-MS analysis was carried out on a Finnigan SSQ 700 mass spectrometer. GC was performed using a 25-m, 0.25-μm film thickness Optima 5-fused silica capillary column (Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany). The column temperature was programmed from 175 °C to 285 °C at 30 °C/min and from 285 °C to 300 °C at 2.5 °C/min and kept at 300 °C for 5 min. The major ion generated in the NCI mass spectra of the PFB ester, TMS ether derivatives of unlabeled and 18O-labeled dinor-iPB1 is the m/z 379 and m/z 381 carboxylate anion (M-181), respectively. Quantitation was performed by comparison of the peak areas of unlabeled and labeled dinor-iPB1 after correction for the fraction (1.5%) of unlabeled dinor-iPB1 derived from the internal standard. For electron impact ionization (EI) GC-MS, dinor isoprostanes B1 were methylated in ethanol with an excess of ethereal diazomethane and silylated withN, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide as described (5Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). High resolution EI mass spectra from the dinor-iPB1 derivatives were obtained on a Finnigan MAT 95Q mass spectrometer. Fatty acid peroxidation was assessed by two different approaches. Autoxidation of α-linolenic acid is accompanied by an increase in UV absorbance at 234 nm because of the formation of diene-conjugated peroxides. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was diluted into 100 mm borate buffer, pH 7.5, and from the absorption at 234 nm, the concentration of conjugated dienes was calculated by using the molar absorption coefficient of hydroperoxylinolenate of 23,000 cm-1m-1. To identify and quantitate different positional isomers of the monohydroperoxylinolenates formed by the action of LOX or during autoxidation, samples were treated with Na+ to reduce the hydroperoxides to their corresponding hydroxy derivatives. The mixture was then extracted with diethyl ether, taken to dryness, and analyzed by straight phase HPLC on a LiChrospher Si60 column (5-μm particle size, 250 × 4 mm, Merck) operated isocratically with hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (98:2:0.05, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Hydroxylinolenates were quantitated at 234 nm and collected for GC-MS analysis. Purified isomers were hydrogenated, methylated, and silylated essentially as described (15Guido D.M. McKenna R. Mathews W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Herold M. Spiteller G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 79: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By EI GC-MS it was possible to assign the position of oxygenation unambiguously. Hydroperoxides were determined by the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange assay as described (17Nourooz-Zadeh J. Tajaddini-Sarmandi J. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). A preparative method was developed to obtain dinor isoprostanes E1 for analytical characterization and as internal standard for GC-MS analysis in the mg scale. Unlabeled and 18O-labeled dinor isoprostanes E1 were produced separately by autoxidation of α-linolenic acid (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). An aliquot of the [18O]dinor isoprostanes E1was isomerized by base treatment to the corresponding B1-type compounds (see Fig. 2) and analyzed by HPLC. The overall yield as determined by HPLC analysis was 27 mg of dinor isoprostane E1 type I and 25 mg of dinor isoprostane E1 type II; the ratio of type I/type II was 1: 0.92. In NCI GC-MS, the carboxylate anions of [18O]iPB1 type I and type II compounds were detected at m/z 381, whereas unlabeled reference compounds were detected at m/z 379, indicating the presence of one 18O atom/molecule labeled with 98.5 atom % oxygen-18. High resolution EI mass spectra of the unlabeled dinor isoprostanes B1 (as methyl esters and TMS ethers) revealed a characteristic fragmentation pattern for each of the two B1 regioisomers: type I, EI-MS (70 eV),m/z (%) = 394.2571 (13Parchmann S.

Because the 18O-label was lost during electron impact-induced fragmentation as C18O, it is likely that the label is located in the carbonyl group of dinor isoprostanes B1. The other two 18O atoms originally present in dinor-iPE1 were lost during the base-catalyzed dehydration process. We first analyzed linolenic acid for the presence of any autoxidized material. Interestingly, on a molar basis linolenic acid (puriss. p.a., stored under argon at −20 °C) was found to be contaminated with 0.72% hydroperoxy compounds and 0.022% dinor isoprostanes E1type I and type II in a ratio of 1:0.8. A ratio of dinor-iPE1 type I/type II of 1:0.75 ± 0.2 is typically found when linolenic acid is autoxidized in water/methanol or without any solvent (see Fig. 3). Therefore, the dinor isoprostane E1 concentration was checked in every batch of linolenic acid before use, and the results were corrected accordingly. Alternatively, linolenic acid was purified by silica column chromatography (see above) before use. To assess the time course of the formation of linolenic acid oxidation products generated by the action of LOX, linolenic acid (60 mg, 216 μmol) was dissolved in 1.2 ml of n-octane and incubated with 48 mg of soybean lipoxygenase in 600 ml of 100 mmsodium borate buffer, pH 7.5. The incubation mixture was sonicated for 1 min and stirred at room temperature. The linolenic acid hydroperoxide (HPOTE) concentration increased linearly over the first 2 h of incubation and then reached a plateau (see Fig. 4). Two h after onset of the reaction, an aliquot of the mixture was analyzed for hydroperoxy fatty acids by straight phase HPLC and GC-MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The main compounds formed were 13- and 9-HPOTE in a ratio of 9:1. Only minor amounts of the 12- and 16-hydroperoxy isomers (<2%, see “Experimental Procedures” for details) were found, whereas 10- and 15-hydroperoxides were not detectable with HPLC. In addition, dinor isoprostanes E1 were quantitated by HPLC as their B1-type derivatives. The time course of product formation is shown in Fig. 4. Synthesis of linolenic acid hydroperoxides and dinor isoprostanes E1 occurred almost in parallel. Both theoretically possible dinor-iPE1regioisomers were formed: type II compounds, which are derived from 13-HPOTE radicals, and type I compounds, which must have been formed via the 12-HPOTE radical (see Fig. 1). The ratio of type I to type II regioisomers detected at different time points after the addition of LOX linearly increased from 1:0.80 at zero time (=E1-dinor isoprostane contaminants of the starting material) to 1:1.5 after 5 h. To explore the effect of LOX on dinor isoprostane E1formation in more detail, linolenic acid (5 mg, 18 μmol) dissolved in 100 μl of n-octane was incubated in 50 ml of borate buffer, pH 7.5, for 5 h in the presence and absence of LOX (4 mg) and analyzed for conjugated diene, HPOTE, and dinor-iPE1formation. Without LOX or with heat-inactivated LOX, only minute amounts of these products were formed (Fig. 5). Inclusion of the radical scavenger, BHT, resulted in a significant increase of conjugated diene compounds and hydroperoxides formed within 5 h (+61%) but efficiently suppressed the formation of dinor-iPE1s (−78%), indicating that dinor-iPE1 synthesis involves free radicals. To further ascertain that LOX catalytic activity rather than a LOX product is responsible for the generation of dinor-iPE1s, we incubated linolenic acid (18 μmol) with 13-hydroperoxylinolenate (9 μmol) and t-butylhydroperoxide (18 μmol) in two separate experiments. The 13-HPOTE used for the assay was produced by LOX-catalyzed oxidation of linolenic acid, purified by reversed phase-HPLC, and quantitated before incubation with linolenic acid. However, both types of hydroperoxides had no significant effect on the autoxidation of α-linolenic acid as indicated by only minor formation of conjugated dienes, hydroperoxides, and dinor-iPE1s, suggesting that LOX activity is required to form significant amounts of dinor isoprostanes (Fig. 5). In all these experiments, n-octane has been added to facilitate the dispersion of α-linolenic acid and to increase the yield of prostaglandin-like cyclization products. However, omission of octane in the standard incubation mixture still resulted in the formation of dinor-iPE1s but reduced the yield to 39%. Thus, a hydrophobic environment, i.e. n-octane droplets, increased the formation of dinor isoprostanes but was not strictly required. Increasing the pH of the borate buffer in the standard incubation to pH 9.6 also decreased the yield of dinor-iPE1s (49%), which may be because of the base-catalyzed conversion of E1 into B1-type compounds, which will not be detected in our assay system. Although the HPLC analysis method described above is rapid and allows the detection of 100 ng of dinor-iPE1 in linolenate autoxidation mixtures, the sensitivity and specificity is not high enough to analyze these compounds in plants. For high sensitivity detection of these compounds, a NCI GC-MS method was employed. To identify unesterified dinor isoprostanes E1 in plant cell cultures, cells of four taxonomically distant plant species were collected and shock frozen with liquid N2. Dinor-iPE1s were extracted, purified, converted into the corresponding dinor-iPB1s, and quantified by NCI GC-MS as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Nicotiana tabacum (Solanaceae), Glycine max (Fabaceae),Rauvolfia serpentina (Apocynaceae), and Agrostis tenuis (Poaceae) contained dinor isoprostanes E1 of the type I and type II in the range of 4.5 -61 ng/g of dry weight (Table I). A representative NCI GC-MS chromatogram (R. serpentina) is shown in Fig. 6. Because of the low concentrations of unesterified dinor isoprostanes E1 in plants, it was not possible to obtain EI mass spectra. To further ascertain the identity of these compounds, we prepared the dinor isoprostane B1 t-butyldimethylsilyl ether and PFB ester derivatives from the plant dinor-iPE1s. These derivatives showed the same GC-MS retention time as authentic reference compounds and yielded identical quantitative data as obtained with the TMS ether derivatives (Fig. 6).Table IConcentration of dinor isoprostanes E1 in plant cell culturesDinor-iPE1 type I mean ±S.D.

In addition, quantification is difficult because of the presence of up to 16 theoretically possible stereoisomers for each regioisomer, which cannot all be separated by GC or HPLC procedures. The conversion of E-ring into B-ring compounds has been shown to facilitate the work-up procedure for GC-MS analysis leading to highly purified dinor-iPB1 samples (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Furthermore, by this procedure the 32 stereoisomers of dinor-iPE1 are converted into 2 racemic dinor-iPB1 compounds (Fig. 2). On GC and HPLC, the two dinor-iPB1 peaks are well separated (Fig. 3 and 6) and represent an integrative measure for the type I and type II dinor-iPE1 regioisomers, thereby enhancing the limit of detection considerably. In contrast to E-, D- and F-ring (dinor) isoprostanes, it is possible to detect B-ring compounds at a convenient wavelength (278 nm) that allows the straightforward quantification of these compounds by HPLC. In vitro synthesis of 18O-labeled and unlabeled dinor isoprostanes yielded mg quantities of these compounds, which were ideally suited as internal standards and reference compounds for GC-MS analysis. We speculated that bicycloendoperoxides might be generated more easily and in a regioisomeric pure form from autoxidation of 13(S)-HPOTE, which is the main product produced from linolenic acid by many plant lipoxygenases. Therefore, we incubated linolenic acid with soybean lipoxygenase, which catalyses the formation of predominately 13(S)- and 9(S)-HPOTE in a ratio of 9:1. Because 13-HPOTE but not 9-HPOTE can autoxidize to bicycloendoperoxides, we expected the formation of regioisomer II almost exclusively. Furthermore, the initially formed bicycloendoperoxides are prone to rapid rearrangement of the endoperoxide group to yield dinor isoprostanes E1 in an aqueous environment with a t 12 of less than 10 min as has been shown for the corresponding C20 endoperoxide PGH2 (2Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we observed not only the formation of type II- but also of type I-dinor isoprostanes E1 in lipoxygenase/linolenic acid incubations (Fig. 4 and 5). This result together with the finding that dinor-iPE1formation was strongly inhibited by BHT suggests that both regioisomers are formed predominately from linolenic acid by a free radical-catalyzed mechanism. However, some of the dinor isoprostane E1 type II compounds were apparently formed from LOX-dependent free radical-catalyzed oxidation of 13-HPOTE, because the ratio of type II to type I dinor-iPE1s increased from 0.75 (typical ratio observed after linolenate autoxidation) to 1.5 during the first 2 h of incubation while LOX was active. It is well known that (especially under low oxygen tension) many lipoxygenase isozymes can generate singlet oxygen and free alkoxyl radicals that may leak out from the active site during the catalytic cycle, i.e. formation of 1-hydroperoxy-2(E),4(Z)-pentadiene systems from 1(Z),4(Z)-pentadiene structures, reviewed in Ref.18Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar. These radicals may attack the lipoxygenase leading to time-dependent suicide inhibition of the enzyme but are also responsible for so-called secondary reactions such as carotenoid and chlorophyll bleaching in vivo (19Siedow J.N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 145-188Crossref Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Thus, BHT may have a dual effect by scavenging free radicals generated by LOX anaerobic cycling, namely preventing suicide inactivation of LOX resulting in higher HPOTE formation and suppression of dinor-iPE1formation. Hydroperoxides such as 13-HPOTE and t-butyl hydroperoxide have been shown to be inefficient inducers of linolenate autoxidation (Fig. 5). Therefore, a free radical source such as LOX appears to be required to catalyze dinor isoprostane formation. In plants, the respiratory chain, the photosynthetic apparatus, and cytochrome P450 enzymes may be important additional sources of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, synthesis of PGF2 from arachidonic acid by soybean LOX-2 was reported by Axelrod and co-workers in 1978 (20Bild G.S. Bhat S.G. Canadai S. Ramadoss C.S. Axelrod B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 21-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the reaction mechanism leading to the formation of apparently several prostaglandin-like compounds has not been clarified. Because the stereochemistry of the PGF2-like product(s) has not been established, it is possible if not likely that not PGF2 but rather isoprostanes F2 were formed, some of which exhibit similar EI GC-MS properties as PGF2α. To investigate if dinor isoprostanes can be generated in vivo, we analyzed different plant cell cultures for the presence of dinor isoprostanes E1. Linolenic acid is a major constituent of plant membranes where it is predominately esterified in glycolipids, phospholipids and neutral lipids. However, in contrast to mammalian cells, up to 0.25% of the total fatty acids are found unesterified as free acids in comparable high concentrations (about 8 μg/g of dry weight (21Conconi A. Miquel M. Browse J.A. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar)). Analysis of four different plant species revealed that both theoretically possible dinor isoprostane E1 regioisomers (Fig. 6, Table I) are present as free acids at low concentrations. In analogy to the pathway in animals, it is likely that even higher levels of dinor isoprostanes are found esterified in membranes rather than unesterified in the cytosol and that dinor isoprostanes F1α and D1 may be also present in plants. Isoprostanes, however, cannot generally be formed in plants because arachidonate is rarely found in significant quantities in higher plants (22Bundy G.L. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1985; 14: 229-262PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, dinor isoprostane formation from α-linolenate may not be significant in animals because of the relatively low concentration of this fatty acid in mammalian membranes. Thus, parallel pathways in plants and animals are operative, each leading to a series of characteristic prostaglandin-like compounds. Dinor isoprostanes may be suitable markers of lipid peroxidation in plants or plant products similar to the isoprostanes, which have been demonstrated to represent specific and reliable markers of oxidant stress in the animal kingdom. In the future, it will be exciting to study if there is also a functional analogy between the mammalian isoprostane and the plant dinor isoprostane pathway. These are fundamental issues to be addressed in the future. We thank Meike Eisenmann and Petra Bauer for excellent technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2026781911,"Receptor-enhanced entry of Ca2+in non-excitable cells is generally ascribed to a capacitative mechanism in which the activation of the entry pathway is specifically dependent on the emptying of agonist-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. Although such entry can be clearly demonstrated under conditions of maximal or near-maximal stimulation, it is uncertain whether such a mechanism can operate during the oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals that are frequently seen following stimulation with low concentrations of agonists. In this study, we report that the stimulation of human m3 muscarinic receptors stably transfected into HEK293 cells results in the appearance of a novel arachidonate-mediated Ca2+ entry pathway. We show that the generation of arachidonic acid and the activation of this pathway are specifically associated with stimulation at the low agonist concentrations that typically give rise to oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals. At such agonist concentrations, however, the generation of arachidonic acid is independent of the simultaneous activation of the phospholipase C-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway. We further show that the arachidonate-mediated Ca2+ entry demonstrates characteristics that distinguish it from the corresponding capacitative pathway in the same cells and therefore is likely to represent an entirely distinct pathway that is specifically responsible for the receptor-enhanced entry of Ca2+ during [Ca2+]i oscillations.

Calcium signaling in non-excitable cells is composed of two components: a release of calcium from intracellular stores and an increased entry of calcium from the extracellular medium. The role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3),1generated as a result of the receptor activation of phospholipase C, in the release of calcium from specific intracellular stores is well established, but the nature of the calcium entry pathway and its regulation is far from clear. To date, discussion of such calcium entry has generally focused on the so-called “capacitative model,” in which calcium entry is activated as a direct consequence of the emptying of the intracellular calcium stores and is independent of how this emptying is actually achieved (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The precise nature of the mechanism for the activation of capacitative entry is, as yet, unclear, but it may involve the release and/or generation of a diffusible signaling molecule within the cell that activates the plasma membrane channels (“store-operated channels”) responsible for calcium entry. Alternatively, a more direct molecular coupling between the stores and the plasma membrane channels may occur (3Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Although such capacitative entry can be clearly demonstrated in a wide variety of different cells, it is far from certain that such a mechanism is the only one involved in the increase in calcium entry in non-excitable cells following receptor activation (4Penner R. Fasolato C. Hoth M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). For example, many cells show an oscillatory [Ca2+]i signal when stimulated at low agonist concentrations (6Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar, 7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and such signals are associated with an enhanced entry of Ca2+. However, evidence indicates that the activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry generally requires significantly higher levels of agonist-generated InsP3 than does the release of Ca2+ from the bulk of the agonist-sensitive internal stores (i.e. at low concentrations of InsP3, substantial release of Ca2+ from agonist-sensitive stores can occur without any activation of capacitative entry) (8Parekh A. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Hartzell C. J. Gen.

Consequently, it is far from clear that the transitory (and/or incomplete) nature of calcium store depletion during [Ca2+]i oscillations would provide an adequate or appropriate signal for the activation of calcium entry via a capacitative mechanism. Such considerations led us previously to investigate the nature of receptor-activated increases in Ca2+ entry during [Ca2+]ioscillations in cells from the exocrine avian nasal gland. In these studies, we showed that such Ca2+ entry was non-capacitative in nature (11Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and appeared to involve a novel arachidonate-activated pathway (12Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we extend our earlier findings to another, more widely used and functionally less highly specialized cell type, namely HEK293 cells. The specific cell line chosen had been stably transfected with the human m3 muscarinic receptor (m3-mAChR), thereby avoiding possible complications resulting from the presence of multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes. Using this cell line, we were able to show that the receptor-mediated generation of arachidonic acid is independent of the simultaneous activation of the PLC-InsP3 pathway, indicating that the m3-mAChR is capable of coupling both to the activation of PLC and the generation of arachidonic acid in a separate but parallel manner. Furthermore, we show that the arachidonate-mediated calcium entry pathway demonstrates characteristics that distinguish it from the more well known capacitative or store-operated entry of calcium. Cultures of the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 that were stably transfected with the human m3 muscarinic receptor (m3-HEK cells) were obtained from Dr. Craig Logsdon (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) (see Ref. 13Yang J. Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Logsdon C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 477-485PubMed Google Scholar for details). These cells were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. Changes in [Ca2+]i in single individual cells were determined following loading with the fluorescent probe indo-1. Loading was achieved by incubation in 4 μm indo-1/AM for 12 min, followed by washing (three times) in saline. Cells were then incubated for a further 30 min at 37 °C to allow for complete hydrolysis of the acetoxymethyl ester. [Ca2+]i was measured as the ratio of the emitted fluorescence, measured as photon counts, at 405 and 485 nm using excitation at 350 nm as described previously (14Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,15Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The technique utilized for the simultaneous determination of changes in [Ca2+]i and Mn2+ quench was as described previously (15Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the experiments designed to eliminate the effects of increases in [Ca2+]i, cells were loaded with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA by preincubation in saline containing 15 μm BAPTA/AM for 20 min. Preliminary experiments showed that this was sufficient to completely abolish any detectable [Ca2+]i signals in cells subsequently stimulated with concentrations of carbachol up to 5 μm. Determinations of arachidonic acid release were essentially as described previously (12Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, m3-HEK cells were cultured in six-well plates until ∼50% confluent. 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid was then added to each well, and culture was continued overnight. The cells were then washed three times with saline containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin prior to addition of agonist and/or drugs as appropriate. Arachidonic acid released during a 5-min incubation was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the supernatant and normalized to the total counts in the cells, determined following solubilization with 1.5m NaOH. Total inositol phosphates were determined in a similar manner. Cells cultured in six-well plates were incubated overnight in the presence of 5 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol, followed by washing three times in saline. To enhance detection of inositol phosphate generation and turnover, experiments were performed in the presence of lithium (10 mm) following a 10-min preincubation in the same concentration of lithium. At the end of the experimental period (5 min), the saline was removed and replaced with 1 ml of 0.5m trichloroacetic acid. After incubation for 15 min on ice, the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was extracted with ether and neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, and the extract was applied to Dowex columns. The loaded columns were washed with water, followed by 60 mm sodium formate plus 5 mm borax, before eluting the inositol phosphates with 1.2 m ammonium formate in 100 mm formic acid. Samples of the eluted inositol phosphates were counted by liquid scintillation. Total inositol phosphate generation is expressed as percent total counts in the phosphoinositide pool, determined from counting samples of the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble tissue fractions following their digestion overnight with 1.5 m NaOH. Arachidonic acid, isotetrandrine, indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), and U73122 were from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc., and the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Calbiochem. [3H]Arachidonic acid and [3H]inositol were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. We first determined whether activation of the transfected m3 muscarinic receptor in HEK cells was coupled to the generation of arachidonic acid, as described previously for the native muscarinic receptor in avian nasal gland cells (12Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that addition of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol to cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid resulted in a marked increase in arachidonic acid generation. This increase was dependent on agonist concentration and was clearly apparent even at agonist concentrations close to the threshold for inducing detectable [Ca2+]i signals in these cells (∼1 μm carbachol). Concentrations of carbachol >5 μm were not examined as, based on our earlier studies (12Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we believed that the receptor activation of arachidonic acid generation and the associated increase in calcium entry were specifically associated with stimulation at low agonist concentrations, when, typically, oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals are seen. To examine the effect of arachidonic acid on [Ca2+]i signaling in m3-HEK cells, low concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid were added to otherwise unstimulated cells. Addition of as little as 3–8 μmarachidonic acid resulted, after a variable lag period of several tens of seconds, in a slow increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2 A). Such an increase in [Ca2+]i could result from an increase in calcium entry from the extracellular medium or from release of calcium from intracellular stores. To distinguish between these two alternatives, lanthanum was used as a generic blocker of calcium entry channels. In the presence of 100 μm La3+, addition of exogenous arachidonic acid failed to increase [Ca2+]i, and only when the La3+ was removed was an increase in [Ca2+]i observed (Fig. 2 B). The failure to observe any increase in [Ca2+]i in the presence of La3+confirms that such an increase reflects an increase in Ca2+entry. These data also rule out the additional possibility that arachidonic acid was inducing an increase in [Ca2+]i by inhibition of the plasma membrane calcium pump. At high concentrations (∼1 mm or higher), La3+ is also known to block the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, but such an effect would be expected to further increase [Ca2+]i, not to block such an increase. To confirm that arachidonic acid was indeed activating calcium entry, simultaneous determinations of changes in [Ca2+]i and Mn2+ quench were performed. In these, extracellular Mn2+ (0.2 mm) is used as a surrogate for Ca2+ as, at low external concentrations, it readily passes through many kinds of Ca2+ channels. On entering the cytosol, the Mn2+ binds to and quenches the fluorescence of such probes as indo-1, and the rate of fluorescence quenching can then be used as an indirect measure of the rate of Mn2+ (and hence Ca2+) entry, at least through those pathways permeable to Mn2+. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the arachidonate-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was associated with a simultaneous increase in the rate of Mn2+quench, indicating that Ca2+ entry is increased. To characterize the effects of the carbachol-induced generation of arachidonic acid and the consequent increase in Ca2+ entry on [Ca2+]i signals in m3-HEK cells, we examined the effect of the biscoclaurine alkaloid isotetrandrine. This substance acts as an apparently specific and readily reversible inhibitor of agonist-induced arachidonic acid generation (16Akiba S. Kato E. Sato T. Fujii T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Hashizume T. Yamaguchi H. Sato T. Fujii T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as demonstrated in our earlier studies on the avian nasal gland (12Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Consistent with those studies, isotetrandrine (10 μm) had no effect on carbachol-induced inositol phosphate generation in m3-HEK cells, but completely blocked the simultaneous carbachol-induced generation of arachidonic acid (Fig. 3). Addition of 10 μm isotetrandrine to cells demonstrating an oscillatory [Ca2+]i signal in response to low concentrations of carbachol resulted in an immediate cessation of the oscillations, which subsequently rapidly returned with normal amplitude and frequency on removal of the isotetrandrine (Fig. 4 A). This is identical to the effect seen in these cells if Ca2+ entry was inhibited during an oscillatory [Ca2+]i response. For example, addition of La3+ to a cell during an oscillatory [Ca2+]i response to carbachol resulted in the immediate cessation of the oscillations, which promptly returned on removal of the La3+ (Fig. 4 B). To confirm that exposure to isotetrandrine during oscillations was indeed inhibiting Ca2+ entry, we again used the Mn2+ quench approach. As previously reported by us (11Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Martin S.C. Shuttleworth T.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and by others (18Jacob R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 421: 55-77Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 19Thorn P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 275-281Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), oscillations in [Ca2+]i were associated with a constant enhanced rate of Mn2+ quench, reflecting a constant Ca2+ entry. Fig. 4 C shows that addition of isotetrandrine induced an immediate inhibition of this rate of Mn2+ quench, which was rapidly restored on removal of the isotetrandrine. The observed effects on Mn2+ quench (and hence, presumably Ca2+ entry) were temporally directly associated with the inhibition of the [Ca2+]ioscillations. It should be noted that the acute sensitivity to inhibition of Ca2+ entry during oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals seen here is not a universal feature in all cell types, some of which will continue to oscillate for some time even after complete removal of extracellular Ca2+(e.g. Xenopus oocytes). Such variation most likely reflects differences in surface-to-volume ratios and in the relative activities of the Ca2+ pumps on the plasma membrane and on the intracellular stores (as well as levels of cytosolic buffers, etc.). However, such differences should not be interpreted as indicating that Ca2+ entry plays no consistent or critical role in oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals as, even in Xenopusoocytes, changes in Ca2+ entry profoundly influence the frequency of agonist-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations (20Girard S. Clapham D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Figure 4A, effect of isotetrandrine on carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. A cell loaded with indo-1 was stimulated with carbachol (1 μm) to induce an oscillatory response in [Ca2+]i, measured as changes in the 405/485 nm fluorescence ratio. During the period indicated (solid bar), isotetrandrine (10 μm) was added. B, effect of inhibiting Ca2+ entry by addition of La3+ (500 μm) on carbachol-induced [Ca2+]ioscillations.

To determine whether the observed effects were due to arachidonic acid itself or to one of the many products of arachidonic acid metabolism, we examined the effects of inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway, using nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and the cyclooxygenase pathway, using indomethacin. Addition of either of these agents to carbachol-stimulated cells showing oscillating [Ca2+]i signals caused an increase in oscillation frequency, which often progressively developed into a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5, A and B). If the activation of Ca2+ entry observed was dependent on the metabolism of arachidonic acid by these pathways, then their inhibition would be expected to result in the reduction or cessation of the [Ca2+]i oscillations, much as seen above when arachidonic acid generation was inhibited by isotetrandrine (Fig. 4). As such, the responses observed are clearly incompatible with the proposal that products of these metabolic pathways for arachidonic acid are responsible for the observed increases in Ca2+ entry during oscillations. The effects seen are, however, consistent with a progressive increase in arachidonic acid levels in stimulated cells subsequent to inhibition of the normal metabolic pathways responsible for its degradation. Such increases might be expected to further increase Ca2+ entry, resulting in a sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i, as observed. The direct effect of arachidonic acid was further confirmed in experiments showing that addition of the non-metabolizable arachidonic acid analog ETYA to unstimulated cells caused an increase in [Ca2+]isimilar to that seen with arachidonic acid (Fig. 5 C). In these experiments, it was noted that the effects of ETYA were frequently more rapid in onset than those seen with arachidonic acid, but required somewhat higher concentrations (∼20 versus∼5 μm). Such data are consistent with the response to exogenously added arachidonic acid being muted by metabolism in the intact cell, yet showing some selectivity for arachidonic acid over its analog ETYA. Together, the above data indicate that it is arachidonic acid itself that is the active moiety responsible for the observed effects on Ca2+ entry. They also suggest that both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways are active in HEK293 cells and, in vivo, act to limit increases in receptor-stimulated levels of arachidonic acid. The m3-mAChR is known to couple, via a member of the Gq family of G proteins, to the activation of phospholipase C and the generation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The former activates protein kinase C, whereas the latter is integral to the initiation of [Ca2+]i signals. To determine whether the observed increased generation of arachidonic acid was a downstream effect of the simultaneous activation of this PLC pathway, various approaches were employed. The possible involvement of InsP3-mediated increases in [Ca2+]iwas examined by determining arachidonic acid generation in cells loaded with the calcium chelator BAPTA (as described under “Materials and Methods”) prior to stimulation with carbachol. As shown in Fig. 6, the carbachol-induced generation of arachidonic acid was completely unimpaired in such BAPTA-loaded cells, indicating that this effect was not dependent on the receptor-activated [Ca2+]i signals. We next examined the possible involvement of the PLC-mediated generation of diacylglycerol and the consequent activation of PKC in the observed mAChR-induced arachidonic acid release. Direct stimulation of PKC activity by addition of the phorbol ester PMA (preincubation for 5 min in the presence of 0.1 μm PMA) resulted in a modest, but significant, inhibition of arachidonic acid release in unstimulated cells (0.14 ± 0.01% in PMA-treated cellsversus 0.18 ± 0.1% in control cells). More significantly, pretreatment with PMA completely abolished the normal mAChR-induced arachidonic acid release seen following addition of carbachol (Fig. 7). These data indicate that the principal effect of PKC activation appears to be to uncouple the stimulation of arachidonic acid release by mAChRs. Although the precise basis for this effect is unknown, these data clearly indicate that the activation of PKC does not result in the stimulation of arachidonic acid generation. Based on the above data from BAPTA-loaded cells and PMA-treated cells, it seems that neither the PLC-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i nor the activation of PKC is involved in the observed activation of arachidonic acid release. Nevertheless, we were concerned that the above experiments may not entirely eliminate a potential involvement of the PLC pathway. For example, it has been reported in several cell types that the stimulation of PKC can exert a negative feedback on receptor-activated PLC activity. It was therefore possible that the failure of PMA to stimulate arachidonic acid release may have simply reflected the concomitant inhibition of PLC activity. Experiments on m3-HEK cells confirmed that PMA (0.1 μm with preincubation for 5 min) did indeed significantly inhibit the carbachol-induced increase in inositol phosphate generation, an effect consistent with a reduction of agonist-activated PLC activity (data not shown). Alternatively, it is possible that the mAChR activation of arachidonic acid generation requires an increase in both [Ca2+]iand PKC activity. We therefore carried out an additional series of experiments examining the effect of the drug U73122 (21Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar) on mAChR activation of arachidonic acid generation. Although not always entirely specific, U73122 has been extensively used as an inhibitor of PLC activity, and consistent with this, we found that in the presence of 10 μm U73122, carbachol-induced inositol phosphate generation was completely abolished (Fig. 8 A). However, under identical conditions, carbachol-induced arachidonic acid generation was unaffected (Fig. 8 B). These data confirm that the observed receptor-activated arachidonic acid generation is not a downstream effect of any PLC activity.Figure 8Effect of U73122 on carbachol-induced inositol phosphate generation (A) and arachidonic acid release (B). Total inositol phosphate generation and arachidonic acid release were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Prior to stimulation with carbachol (CCh) at the concentrations indicated, experimental cells were exposed to U73122 (10 μm) for 10 min. Data are presented as the carbachol-induced increase in total inositol phosphate generation or arachidonic acid release over the corresponding controls in the absence (shaded columns) or presence (stippled columns) of U73122. Values are the means ± S.E. (n = 4 (arachidonic acid (AA)) and n = 3 (total inositol phosphates (IPs))).

However, under normal circumstances of receptor stimulation, the discharge of the intracellular Ca2+ stores occurs as a result of the PLC-mediated generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which activates Ca2+-permeable channels on the stores. The demonstration that mAChR activation of arachidonic acid generation is not a downstream effect of the simultaneous activation of PLC (see above) suggests that the arachidonate-activated Ca2+ entry is unlikely to be part of a capacitative mechanism. This is further supported by the fact that isotetrandrine, which, as shown, is an effective inhibitor of receptor-activated arachidonic acid generation, has no effect on the capacitative entry of Ca2+ induced by thapsigargin (data not shown). Similar data were obtained in our earlier studies on avian nasal gland cells (12Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and have been reported for the related compound tetrandrine in adrenal glomerulosa cells (22Rossier M.F. Python C.P. Capponi A.M. Schlegel W. Kwan C.Y. Vallotton M.B. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, this does not entirely preclude the possibility that arachidonic acid is involved in some way in the capacitative mechanism. For example, the complete depletion of the stores induced by thapsigargin may result in such a profound stimulation of the capacitative mechanism that isotetrandrine is not able to reverse it significantly. Alternatively, a single type of Ca2+ entry channel (store-operated channel) may be capable of being activated by the capacitative signal, whatever its nature, or by arachidonic acid depending on the circumstances. To preclude these possibilities, we examined the effect of reducing extracellular pH on the Ca2+ entry activated by thapsigargin and by arachidonic acid. Modest reductions in extracellular pH have been shown to have a profound inhibitory effect on capacitative Ca2+ entry in a range of different cell types (23Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G917-G924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Negulescu P.A. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G770-G778PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wakabayashi I. Groschner K. Biochem. Biophys.

A family of DGKs has been identified in multicellular organisms over the past few years, but the physiological function(s) of this diversity is not clear. One clue has come from theDrosophila DGK2, rdgA, since mutations in this gene cause retinal degeneration. We isolated a novel DGK, which we designated DGKι, from human retina and brain libraries. DGKι contains two cysteine-rich repeats, a region similar to the phosphorylation site domain of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a conserved catalytic domain, and four ankyrin repeats at its C terminus. By primary structure, it is most similar to human DGKζ and Drosophila rdgA. An >12-kilobase mRNA for DGKι was detected only in brain and retina among the tissues examined. In cells transfected with the DGKι cDNA, we detected an approximately 130-kDa protein by immunoassay, and activity assays demonstrated that it encodes a functional DAG kinase. The protein was found to be in both the cytoplasm and nucleus with the localization controlled by PKC isoforms α and γ. The gene encoding DGKι was localized to human chromosome 7q32.3–33, which is known to be a locus for an inherited form of retinitis pigmentosa.

Diacylglycerol (DAG)1 is essential for synthesis of membranes because it is a central intermediate for phospholipid biosynthesis and has an equally important role in energy storage by virtue of being a precursor for triacylglycerols. DAG also is a component of a ubiquitous signal transduction pathway; in response to many types of stimuli, including mitogens, there is a rapid rise in cellular DAG, which serves as an allosteric activator of protein kinase C (PKC). This protein kinase mediates many cellular responses including growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), which catalyzes phosphorylation of DAG to phosphatidic acid (PA), is thought to be a key enzyme in the regulation of DAG levels and, as a result, to be responsible for attenuating the activation of PKC. For example, a constitutively elevated level of DAG (leading to activated PKC) is common in transformed cells, and experimental overexpression of DGKα decreased the elevated DAG level in ras-transformed fibroblasts (3Fu T. Sugimoto Y. Okano Y. Kanoh H. Nozawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This type of experiment suggests that conversion of DAG to PA suppresses a mitogenic signal, but this conclusion is complicated by the fact that PA itself may be mitogenic (4Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Tilly B.C. Verlaan I. Bierman A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in the regulation of DNA synthesis, in the induction of c-myc, c-fos, and platelet-derived growth factor; in cAMP formation (5Bocckino S.B. Wilson P.B. Exton J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6210-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Van Corven E.J. Van Rijswijk A. Jalink K. Van DerBend R.L. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem.

Thus, since both DAG and PA can act as second messengers, their interconversion, for example by DGK, is likely to be tightly regulated. DGK activities have been detected from a variety of tissues and organisms from Arabidopsis thaliana and Escherichia coli to mammals. Eight mammalian DGKs have been identified and characterized; they differ in their activators, expression patterns, substrate specificity, and structural domains. DGKs can be divided into five subfamilies according to distinctive structural motifs. Type I includes DGKα (9Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T.

The pleckstrin domain domain has been found in a number of proteins involved in signal transduction and serves as a site of protein-protein and protein-phospholipid interactions (16Musacchio A.

McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10237-10241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), has the simplest structure in the DGK family and shows substrate selectivity for DAG with an arachidonoyl residue at thesn-2-position. Type IV is typified by DGKζ (19Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which has four ankyrin repeats at its C terminus and a region similar to the MARCKS phosphorylation site domain. The Drosophila DGK2rdgA gene also belongs to this group, and it is expressed almost exclusively in the retina (20Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A mutation in rdgAcauses degeneration of photoreceptor cells and blindness (20Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl.

Interestingly, the photoreceptor cells degenerate regardless of whether the cells are exposed to light or not, implying thatDrosophila DGK2 rdgA may be required for more than just a light-signaling cascade, and a recent study showed that the degeneration begins with disruption of organelles responsible for the transportation of phospholipids to the photoreceptor membrane (21Masai I. Suzuki E. Yoon C.S. Kohyama A. Hotta Y. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of the mutations that results in the retinal degeneration phenotype in Drosophila is a stop codon before the ankyrin repeats, and these motifs are known to mediate protein recognition (22Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins containing ankyrin repeats are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as gene regulation (23LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L.

Here, we report the identification of the ninth member of the DGK family in mammals, DGKι; it contains two cysteine-rich repeats, the highly conserved DGK catalytic domain, a region similar to the phosphorylation site domain in MARCKS, and four ankyrin repeats at its C terminus. Domain comparison shows that it is a type IV DGK, and its expression in retina and brain suggests that it may have an important function in vision. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol), ECL detection reagents, and Hybond-N nylon membrane were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A human retina 5′-STRETCH cDNA library (λgt11, oligo(dT) + random primed), human brain 5′-STRETCH plus cDNA library (λgt11, oligo(dT) + random primed), pEUK-C1 expression vector, and human multiple tissue Northern blot were purchased fromCLONTECH. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, streptomycin, lipofectAMINE, and BenchMarkTMprestained protein ladder were from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and RNase inhibitor were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Avanti Polar Lipids provided phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid; all other lipids were from Serdary. Octyl β-glucopyranoside (ULTROL Grade) was purchased from Calbiochem. ATP and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat F(ab′)2anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody were from Biosource International. DGKζ cDNA sequence was used to perform a BLAST search against the EST data base. An EST clone (GenBankTM accession H37913) was found that was similar to the cysteine-rich region of the DGK family, but its nucleotide sequence was distinct. The EST purchased from ATCC was I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone ID 437714 and was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) cDNA. This cDNA clone was sequenced and used to probe other libraries. One million phage recombinants were plated from a human retina cDNA library (CLONTECH). All plaques were transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were screened with two HindIII- and XhoI-digested EST fragments. Membranes were prehybridized (4 h; 65 °C) in 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS, and 0.1% Na2P4O7. Hybridization was performed (overnight; 65 °C) in the same solution. The membranes were washed twice in 0.6× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% Na2P4O7 (30 min; 65 °C). Two positives were isolated from the screening. These two positives were released from λgt11 vector by EcoRI, subcloned into pBluescriptII, and sequenced. This library was screened once more by using these two clones as probes. Since the 3′ coding sequence is missing in these clones, the first two isolated clones were further used as probes to screen a human brain λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) to obtain the full-length sequence. Over 2 million clones were plated and screened as described previously. Positives were isolated and subcloned into pBluescriptII. The 3′ coding sequence was found from this screening. More clones containing longer 3′-UTR sequence were found by brain library screening and EST searches using sequences obtained from isolated clones. Clone R13-1, containing the sequence around the catalytic domain region of DGKι in a pBluescriptII vector was linearized by HindIII and used as a template for digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe synthesis. The human multiple tissue Northern blot and multiple human brain Northern blots were performed by using this probe following the procedure previously described (19Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Two μg of total RNA from human brain, kidney, pancreas, placenta, and skeletal muscle (CLONTECH) and about 0.5 μg of mRNA (CLONTECH) and total RNA from retina were used for cDNA synthesis. Total RNA from human retinal sample was extracted by using the guanidinium thiocyanate extraction method. RNA samples were heated for 5 min at 90 °C before cDNA synthesis reactions, which were performed in a 20-μl reaction with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 3 mm MgCl2, 75 mmKCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 2.5 mm oligo(dT), 40 units of RNase inhibitor, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were diluted into 130 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O, and 10 μl of the dilution was used for each PCR amplification. The primers used for amplifying DGKι were LD 23-1 (5′-TGA ATC CCA AGA GTG GAG GCA AC-3′ and LD 23-2 (5′-GGA GGT TCC AGC GAT CTA GCT G-3′). The primers were chosen from different exons to avoid amplifications from potential contamination of genomic DNA in the RNA samples. Glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers were used as control primers. The PCR reactions were carried out for 35 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Human DGKι cDNA clones were subcloned into pEUK-C1 (CLONTECH) in the forward orientation. Some of the UTR sequence was not included. COS-7 cells in P35 dishes were transfected with 1 μg of DGKι containing pEUK-C1 plasmid DNA and 5 ml of LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were harvested after 48 h of incubation and scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor). All homogenates were frozen and stored at −70 °C until assayed. The DGK assay was performed as described previously (19Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the PKC cotransfection experiment, 500 ng of DNA encoding PKCα, -β, or -γ (in PCDNA3/Amp; a gift from J. Metherall, University of Utah) were combined with 500 ng of full-length DGKι. Cells were transfected as described above (19Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An anti-peptide rabbit polyclonal antibody was made to a peptide ((C)AGQKEKDEALEEKLRN) (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton MA), which corresponded to DGKι residues Ala109–Asn124. The extra cysteine residue (shown in parentheses) was used to couple the peptide to a carrier protein (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) prior to immunization. The antibody was affinity-purified from serum using the same peptide. Transfected COS-7 cells were harvested and separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as described previously (28Payrastre B. Nievers M. Boonstra J. Breton M. Verkleij A.J. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples from transfected COS-7 cells and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to the Millipore membrane. For the peptide competition experiment, the primary antibody was incubated with 4 volumes of 100 ng/ml peptide at 4 °C for 2 h prior to incubation with the membrane. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). DGKι cDNA was purified and used to isolate a genomic clone from a human Bac library (Genome System Inc). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (29Pinkel D. Straume T. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (2958) Google Scholar). We used the cDNA sequence from DGKζ to perform a BLAST search against the EST data base and found a sequence from a retina library that was similar to the cysteine-rich repeats region of DGKζ but appeared to be a novel DGK. To further analyze this EST (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone ID 437714), we sequenced it completely; it was 1.9 kb in length, contained two cysteine-rich repeats and part of the conserved DGK catalytic domain, and was similar to DGKζ. However, there was a deletion in the catalytic domain that included a portion of the ATP binding site (Fig. 1 A), which would have rendered it inactive. Additionally, the 3′ sequence of this clone was not homologous to DGKζ (19Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and an unexpected early stop codon was found. Thus, although this clone appeared to be a novel DGK, it was not clear that it encoded a functional enzyme; however, we hypothesized that the partial deletion of the catalytic domain and other uncommon features might have resulted from aberrant splicing. To test this, we used the EST clone as a probe to search for the putative novel DGK in a retina library. Our first retina library screening yielded two clones, R11-1 and R13-1 (Fig. 1). Clone R11-1, which was ∼1.4 kb, overlapped the EST clone and continued about 700 bp upstream. It contained a putative translation start site and an in frame stop codon 30 bp upstream from the ATG site. The second clone, R13-1 (∼0.8 kb) contained the full catalytic domain including the missing ATP binding site. The sequence of this clone that was 3′ to the catalytic domain shared regions of identity with DGKζ and lacked the early stop codon of the EST clone but was incomplete. To find the full open reading frame, millions of recombinant phages from several retina libraries were screened and several more clones were isolated (e.g.clone R2-1; Fig. 1), but none of them contained a substantial 3′ extension.Figure 1Sequence of the human DGKι cDNA isolated from retina and brain libraries.

Using clones R11-1 and R13-1 as probes, 14 positives were found from two separate screenings. Clone B23-1 (∼2 kb) overlapped with clone R13-1 and contained the missing coding sequence at the 3′-end. Four ankyrin repeats and a stop codon were found in this clone. Another clone, B13-1 (∼3.6 kb), had about 1.6 kb of 3′-untranslated sequence but did not contain a poly(A) tail. Clone B23-1 and B13-1 were used to do further searches against the EST data base, which revealed additional clones that contained more 3′-UTR sequence. These were obtained and sequenced; the overlapping map of all of the cDNAs is shown in Fig. 1 A. The combined sequence revealed a DGK with an open reading frame of 3198 nucleotides and a predicted protein that would contain 1065 amino acids. We designated this isoform ι. Like other DGKs, it contained the conserved cysteine-rich repeats near the N terminus and the typical DGK catalytic domain. The first and second cysteine-rich repeats included the motifs HX 11CX 6CX 12CX 2CX 4HX 2CX 10C and HX 11CX 2CX 19CX 2CX 4HX 4CX 9C, respectively (Fig. 1 B). DGKι has a well conserved ATP binding site (Fig. 1 B). However, it did not contain the EF-hand motifs present in the type I DGKs, so it presumably would lack the trait of being stimulated by Ca2+. The proteins that are most closely related to human DGKι are human DGKζ (72% similarity, 63% identity) and the Drosophila DGK2rdgA (49% similarity, 40% identity). Like DGKζ, DGKι contains a region that is similar to the phosphorylation site domain from MARCKS (RKKKRTSFKRKASKR) and, like both DGKζ and Drosophila rdgA, contains four ankyrin repeats near the C terminus. A comparison of the ankyrin repeats among DGKι, DGKζ, and rdgA is shown in Fig. 1 C. Despite the similarity in the coding sequence of DGKι and DGKζ, the size of DGKι message is much larger than DGKζ as a result of the long 3′-UTR sequence. Interestingly, this portion of the DGKι sequence is more similar to the rdgA gene, for which the mRNA is ∼9 kb (20Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), than to human DGKζ. We analyzed a variety of human tissues by Northern blot to determine the size and expression pattern of human DGKι. We found that DGKι was expressed only in brain among the eight tissues examined and that the size of the mRNA was ≥ 12 kb (weak signals at about 9.5 and 7.5 kb also were detected) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, human DGKζ mRNA was present in all eight tissues at sizes of 3.7 and 4.2 kb (19Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We next examined samples from specific regions of human brain and found DGKι mRNA in almost every region but in different amounts. It was highly expressed in hippocampus, caudate nucleus, occipital pole, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. Therefore, DGKι has a more restricted expression pattern than DGKζ despite the similarity of their domain motifs. Since our original clone was described in a retina library, and because rdgA is highly expressed in Drosophila retina, we suspected that DGKι is expressed in human retina. To assess this possibility, we used reverse transcription-PCR to amplify a 366-bp fragment from the catalytic domain region of the DGKι and found expression exclusively in human retina and brain. No signals were detected even after 35 cycles of the PCR reaction in samples from pancreas, placenta, kidney, and skeletal muscle. The glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase control primers amplified relatively equally from all samples (Fig. 2 B). This result confirmed the results from our Northern blots and added additional evidence that rdgA and human DGKι are orthologs, since their tissue distribution, like their primary structure, is conserved. To test whether the cloned DGKι encodes a functional DGK, we subcloned two EcoRI fragments containing the entire coding sequence of DGKι into a mammalian expression vector. We also developed an antibody to a unique peptide from the predicted amino acid sequence. The cDNA expression construct was transfected into COS-7 cells, and homogenates were prepared for both enzymatic assay and immunoassay. A protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 130 kDa was recognized by the peptide antibody in extracts of the transfected cells. The molecular mass of the protein expressed from the DGKι cDNA compares favorably with the predicted size of 117 kDa. Extracts from cells transfected with the vector alone or with no DNA did not react with the antibody. Furthermore, preincubation of the peptide antigen with the antibody blocked the recognition of the 130-kDa protein, confirming that the interaction was specific (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the predicted translation start site can be used effectively to make a 130-kDa protein. In other work, Topham et al. (31Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) found that the region in DGKζ that is homologous to the MARCKS phosphorylation site domain can function as a nuclear localization sequence. Since DGKι has this same sequence (Fig. 1 B), we predicted that a portion of the enzyme would be found in the nucleus. To test this possibility, homogenates from transfected COS-7 cells were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, which were analyzed by immunoblotting. An antibody against a cytoplasmic protein was used as a control to ensure the purity of each fraction. About one-quarter to one-third of the DGKι was found in the nuclear fraction, with the majority in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 B). This result demonstrated that DGKι is distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The MARCKS protein is a major substrate for protein kinase C in all cells. We recently showed that residues in the MARCKS phosphorylation site domain in DGKζ are targets for PKCα and -γ, but not other isoforms, and that this phosphorylation results in exclusion of the DGK from the nucleus (31Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We questioned whether the nuclear localization of DGKι also is regulated by PKC. We cotransfected DGKι with one of the three PKC isoforms (PKCα, -β, or -γ) into COS-7 cells, respectively. Homogenates from transfected COS-7 cells were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, which were analyzed by immunoblotting. We found that the nuclear localization of DGKι was lost when PKCα or PKCγ were expressed, but not when PKCβ was expressed (Fig. 3 C). Thus, as with the related isoenzyme, DGKζ, the subcellular localization of DGKι is regulated by specific isoforms of PKC. Homogenates from cells transfected with the DGKι cDNA or vector alone were assayed for DGK enzymatic activity. The cells transfected with DGKι showed much greater activity than those transfected with vector alone or nontransfected cells, which demonstrated that human DGKι encodes a functional enzyme. We tested two different substrates and found that DGKι displayed a pattern similar to DGKζ in that it utilized 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol equally well (Fig. 4); i.e. DGKι has no preference for DAG with an arachidonoyl residue at thesn-2-position unlike DGKε. The DGKι cDNA was used to isolate a genomic clone from a human Bac library. To determine the physical location of the DGKι gene, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization using the Bac clone as a probe and found that it localized to chromosome 7q32.3–33 (Fig. 5). We report here the identification of the ninth member of the mammalian DGK family, DGKι, which we discovered by searching the EST data base with a known member of the DGK family. DGKι has highest sequence similarity with human DGKζ and Drosophila rdgA(72 and 49%, respectively, at the amino acid level). DGKι shares the domain motifs that typify the type IV DGKs: two cysteine-rich repeats, a conserved catalytic domain, and four ankyrin repeats at their C termini. Like the other members of the DGK family, DGKι shares the greatest amount of homology with other DGKs in the catalytic domain. Interior to that domain, DGKι also has the conserved putative ATP binding site GXGXXG, of which a mutation in the second glycine in Drosophila DGK2 causes the rdgAphenotype. In addition, DGKι contains a sequence similar to the phosphorylation site domain in MARCKS, which has been shown to serve as a nuclear localization signal and PKC phosphorylation site in DGKζ (31Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Our study shows that the majority of DGKι protein is located in the cytoplasm, with a smaller fraction in the nucleus. The existence of a potential nuclear export signal at Leu442–Leu450 may explain this bimodal distribution. Alternatively, the nuclear localization of DGKι is regulated by phosphorylation in much the same manner as DGKζ, in which phosphorylation by PKC attenuates the nuclear localization (31Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). With DGKζ, the nuclear localization attenuates the accumulation of DAG in response to a mitogenic stimulus (31Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and DGKι may have a similar effect, which could affect growth and differentiation. The dominant structural feature that defines DGKι, DGKζ, and dDGK2rdgA as members of a subfamily is the domain with multiple ankyrin repeats, which have been shown to be crucial for the function of Drosophila DGK2 rdgA. A DrosophilaDGK2 nonsense mutation in the linker region between the catalytic domain and the ankyrin repeats leads to a truncated protein and causes the mutant phenotype. Although the exact function of the ankyrin repeats in mammalian type IV DGKs is not known, these sequences in other proteins have been implicated in a variety of cellular regulatory processes including protein-protein interaction, gene regulation, and cell cycle control (23LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24Watanabe H. Sawada J.I. Yano K.I. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 26Andrews B.J. Herskowitz I. Nature. 1989; 342: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The similar pattern of tissue expression between DGKι and Drosophila DGK2 suggests that the ankyrin repeats may play an important role in the function of DGKι as they do in Drosophila DGK2. A potential explanation for the high similarity between DGKι and DGKζ is that they may have resulted from gene duplication during evolution. In C. elegans and Drosophila, there appears to be only a single isoform of the type IV DGKs based upon homology searches (not shown). The product of such a duplication could lead to the two genes DGKι and DGKζ, which share great similarity between their sequences and motifs yet have distinct expression patterns and markedly different sizes of their messenger RNA. DGKι was shown to be expressed exclusively in brain and retina by Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR, whereas DGKζ is produced abundantly in many tissues (19Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Ding L. Bunting M. Topham M.K. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5519-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mRNAs of DGKζ are about 3.7 and 4.2 kb in length, while the message of DGKι is >12 kb and includes a very long 3′-UTR. Worthy of note is that Drosophila DGK2 also has a long message length of 9 kb, and 3′-UTR sequences have been found to be involved in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation (32Tanguay R.L. Gallie D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 33Schwartz M.L. Bruce J. Shneidman P.S. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26364-26369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is possible that DGKι and Drosophila DGK2, rdgAUTR sequences are involved in the regulation of their tissue-specific expression and the stability of their messages. DGKs catalyze the conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid, which probably is relevant to two important cellular functions; it is a crucial step in the synthesis of phospholipids and also serves to turn off signals transduced through DAG. The latter is likely to be the explanation for the presence of multiple isoforms, since compartmentalization of signals and the relevant enzymes has been shown in many systems. Both DAG and phosphatidic acid can have signaling functions, and since DGK catalyzes this reaction, it may play a pivotal role in regulation of signaling through the phosphatidylinositol pathway. In support of this possibility, the mutation in Drosophila rdgA causes retinal degeneration within a week of eclosion. The lack of catalytic function was confirmed by measuring the levels of DAG, which were found to be near normal, and PA, which were markedly reduced (34Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Hotta Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5996-6000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result from Drosophila suggests that human DGKι may be important for the production of PA in retina, which has a relatively high amount of PA compared with other tissues. Mutations in phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) (35Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), DGK2 (20Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and PKC (36Smith D.P. Ranganathan R. Hardy R.W. Marx J. Tsuchida T. Zuker C.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) all have been found to cause retinal degeneration in Drosophila, so other members of this signaling pathway have similar phenotypes. A corresponding mutation has not yet been found in humans, but the phosphatidylinositol cycle and the PKC signaling pathway are well conserved between insect and mammal, and our identification of DGKι may help to elucidate retinal signaling pathways. Interestingly, a dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa 10 has been genetically mapped to a locus in the same chromosomal region, 7q32.3–33, as we found for DGKι, which suggests it as a candidate gene for this disorder.

https://openalex.org/W2061287402,"The seed lectin from Dioclea grandiflora (DGL) has recently been shown to possess high affinity for 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranose, the core trimannoside of asparagine-linked carbohydrates, but lower affinity for biantennary complex carbohydrates. In the previous paper, the thermodynamics of DGL binding to deoxy analogs of the core trimannoside and to a biantennary complex carbohydrate were determined by isothermal titration microcalorimetry. The data suggest that DGL recognizes specific hydroxyl groups of the trimannoside similar to that of the jack bean lectin concanavalin A (ConA) (Gupta, D. Dam, T. K., Oscarson, S., and Brewer, C. F.

In the present paper, the x-ray crystal structure of DGL complexed to the core trimannoside was determined to a resolution of 2.6 Å. The overall structure of the DGL complex is similar to the structure of the ConA-trimannoside complex (Naismith, J. H., and Field, R. A. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 972–976). The location and conformation of the bound trimannoside as well as its hydrogen-bonding interactions in both complexes are nearly identical. However, differences exist in the location of two loops outside of the respective binding sites containing residues 114–125 and 222–227. The latter residues affect the location of a network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that interact with the trisaccharide. Differences in the arrangement of ordered water molecules in the binding site and/or protein conformational differences outside of the binding site may account for the differences in the thermodynamics of binding of the two lectins to deoxy analogs of the trimannoside. Molecular modeling studies suggest how DGL discriminates against binding the biantennary complex carbohydrate relative to ConA.

Molecular modeling studies suggest how DGL discriminates against binding the biantennary complex carbohydrate relative to ConA. concanavalin A, lectin from jack bean seed lectin from D. grandiflora mannose. Lectins derived from the seeds of leguminous plants are a well known group of carbohydrate-binding proteins (cf. Refs. 1Sharon N. Lis H.

Concanavalin A (ConA),1 the lectin fromCanavalia enisformis (jack bean), is the best known member of the Leguminosae lectins because of its numerous biological applications related to its carbohydrate binding activity (cf.

The affinity of ConA for simple saccharides possessing Man or Glc residues has been known for over 60 years (cf. Ref. 4Goldstein I.J. Hollerman C.E. Smith E.E. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 876-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). However, the high affinity of ConA for certainN-linked carbohydrates is due to its specificity for 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranose, the core trimannoside present in N-linked carbohydrates (5Brewer C.F.

The binding epitopes of the trimannoside have recently been investigated by isothermal titration microcalorimetry using deoxy analogs of methyl 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside (1 in Fig. 1) (7Mandal D.K.

The results indicate the involvement of specific hydroxyl groups on all three residues of the trimannoside in binding to ConA. Importantly, the solution isothermal titration microcalorimetry data agree with the recently reported 2.3-Å x-ray crystal structure of ConA complexed to the trimannoside (9Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J.

Recently, DGL was shown to bind with high affinity to the core trimannoside (16Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5685-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Gupta D.

Furthermore, hemagglutination inhibition studies using deoxy analogs of 1 suggested that DGL and ConA recognize similar epitopes of the trisaccharide (17Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, DGL was also shown to possess relatively weak affinity for a biantennary complex carbohydrate (2 in Fig. 1), while ConA shows high affinity for the oligosaccharide (13Dam T.K. Cavada B.S.

Differences have also been reported in the biological properties of both lectins, including different histamine release activities in rat peritoneal mast cells (19Gomes J.C. Rossi R.R. Cavada B.S. Moreira R.A. Oliveira J.T.A. Agents Actions. 1994; 41: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed, the histamine release activities of nine Diocleinae subtribe lectins including DGL and ConA have been recently shown to correlate with their relative affinities for pentasaccharide 2 (13Dam T.K. Cavada B.S. Grangeiro T.B. Santos C.F. de Sousa F.A.M. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12082-12088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since DGL and ConA showed the lowest and highest affinities, respectively, for2 (13Dam T.K. Cavada B.S. Grangeiro T.B. Santos C.F. de Sousa F.A.M. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol.

In the present study, the crystal structure of DGL complexed with1 has been determined to a resolution of 2.6 Å. The results allow comparison of the structure of the DGL-trimannoside complex with the structure of the corresponding ConA complex. The possible structural basis for the differences in the thermodynamic binding data of the two lectins for certain deoxy analogs of 1 (18Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) is also addressed. Last, molecular modeling has been used to investigate differences in the binding specificities of the DGL and ConA for2 and hence their biological activities. DGL was isolated from D. grandiflora seeds obtained from northeastern Brazil (Albano Ferreira Martin Ltd., Sao Paulo, Brazil) as described previously (11Moreira R.A. Barros A.C.H. Stewart J.C. Pusztai A. Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the amino acid sequence was verified. 2C. F. Brewer and X.-J. Tang, unpublished results. Crystals of DGL were produced at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique (20Blundell T.L. Johnson L.N. Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). The well contained 0.6 m NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MnCl2. The drop contained 25 mg/ml protein and 5 mm sugar. An x-ray diffraction data set was collected to a resolution of 2.6 Å at room temperature using a single crystal of size 0.4 × 0.5 × 0.8 mm. During refinement, data to 2.4 Å were included. The x-ray source used was a Rigaku RU-200 generator with a copper rotating anode (CuK αλ = 1.54 Å). The x-ray detector used was a Siemens X-1000A multiwire. The raw data were integrated and scaled with the SADIE/SAINT software package (Siemens Inc., Madison, WI).

The solvent content of the crystals is 75%, and the asymmetric unit contains two subunits of the tetramer. Each subunit consists of residues 1–237. The subunits of the asymmetric unit are related by a nearly perfect (180.1°) noncrystallographic two-fold axis (only a 0.23-Å deviation in α-carbon position). In addition, the two subunits of the asymmetric unit are related to two other subunits through a perpendicular crystallographic two-fold axis, with the resulting tetramer possessing 222 symmetry. Initial phases for the structure factor data were obtained using the molecular replacement technique. The atomic coordinates of a single subunit of ConA (Protein Data Bank, entry code 5CNA) were used as the search model (with all sugar atoms and water molecules removed). Solutions for the rotation function were obtained using AMoRE (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) incorporated into the CCP4 package (22Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19734) Google Scholar). Subsequent Patterson correlation refinement of the rotation function solutions and determination of the translation function solutions were performed with XPLOR (23Brunger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Additional rigid body refinement with XPLOR gave anR value = 37.7%, and R free of 36.3%. Electron density maps were then calculated, and the location of bound trimannoside 1 could be clearly identified, verifying the correctness of the molecular replacement solution. The appropriate amino acid changes were made to convert the molecular model replacement of ConA to DGL, and simulated annealing refinement was performed (R value = 26.7%;R free = 34.3%) using XPLOR. Throughout all refinements, each subunit of the dimer was allowed to refine independently; i.e. noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not applied. The correctness of the model was verified with a series of XPLOR simulated annealing omit maps. Two molecules of1 (one for each subunit of the dimer) and 190 ordered water molecules were placed in the model over the course of cycling between manual model building using the program CHAIN (24Sack J.S. Quiocho R.A. CHAIN: A Crystallographic Modeling Program. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX1988Google Scholar) and XPLOR positional refinement followed by individual temperature factor refinement (finalR value = 18.9%, final R free = 25.2%). Model refinement statistics are in TableI. In order to compare the final structure of the DGL-trimannoside complex with the ConA-trimannoside complex (PDB entry code 5CVN) (9Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and the ConA-pentasaccharide (2) complex (PDB entry code 1TEI) (25Moothoo D.N. Naismith J.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the atomic coordinates of the ConA complexes were superimposed onto that of DGL using the Dabsch method (26Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2328) Google Scholar, 27Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1978; 34: 827-828Crossref Scopus (908) Google Scholar) applied to the α-carbon positions. In order to compare the positions of the ordered water molecules between the DGL-trimannoside complex and the ConA-trimannoside complex, a composite set of coordinates was created for a single subunit of the ConA-trimannoside complex by combining all of the water molecule positions from different superimposed subunits of the asymmetric unit and then eliminating redundant positions. The x-ray crystal structure of DGL complexed with trimannoside1 has been determined to a resolution of 2.6 Å. The thermodynamics of DGL binding to 1 and deoxy analogs of1 obtained in the previous paper (18Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) can now be compared with the structure of the DGL complex with 1. In addition, the structural and thermodynamic data for DGL can be compared with corresponding structural (9Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Loris R. Maes D. Poortmans F. Wyns L. Bouckaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30614-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and thermodynamic data for ConA (8Gupta D. Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6388-6392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Determination of the structure of the DGL complex with 1also permits molecular modeling of the interactions of the lectin with complex carbohydrate 2 (Fig. 1) and a comparison with the recently determined structure of ConA complexed to 2 (25Moothoo D.N. Naismith J.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The overall structure of DGL determined by x-ray crystallography consists of four identical 237-residue subunits, each of which fold into two β-sheets (Fig. 3 A). The DGL tetramer is formed by the combination of two perpendicular two-fold symmetry axes, creating a molecule with 222 symmetry. The structural fold and subunit association of DGL are very similar to that of ConA, as expected from their high amino acid sequence homology (Fig. 1). The root mean square deviation in α-carbon positions over all residues between the DGL-trimannoside tetramer and the ConA-trimannoside tetramer is only 0.84 Å. Although the overall structures of the two lectins are similar, there exist two differences, which are highlighted in Fig. 3 A. The α-carbon backbone of two loops, residues 114–125 and residues 222–227, deviates by as much as 6.0 and 3.0 Å, respectively. Residues 114–125 differ by 5 amino acids in the two lectins (Fig. 2) and are located at a subunit interface in both proteins. Residues 222–227 contain only one amino acid difference (at position 226; Gly in DGL, Thr in ConA) and are located near the carbohydrate binding regions in both proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 B, residues 114–125 in DGL involve different pairs of contacting residues in the dimer subunit interface than in ConA (28Hardman K.D. Ainsworth C.F. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4910-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In DGL, the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ile120 hydrogen bonds to the side chain of His131 of the adjacent subunit. At the same location in ConA, residues 114–125 are shifted from that of DGL (the α-carbon position of Ile120 in DGL and Thr120 in ConA deviate by 6.5 Å), allowing different residues to make the same interface contact. The structure of ConA in this region has been reported to be fairly disordered (9Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in DGL the loop comprising residues 114–125 is more ordered and buried deeper into the subunit interface than the corresponding loop of ConA. Residues 222–227 in DGL and ConA are much closer to the carbohydrate binding site in both complexes and show differences in their polypeptide chain structures (Fig. 3 C). These differences appear to relate to thermodynamic differences in carbohydrate binding discussed below. Fig. 4 displays the 2‖Fo‖ − ‖F c‖Φc electron density of 1 bound to DGL and gives an indication of the high quality of the x-ray data and accuracy to which the atomic position assignments are made for all three residues of the trisaccharide. The results show that the trimannoside is bound in the exact same conformation in both DGL and ConA and that the same conserved amino acid residues (Tyr12, Pro13, Asn14, Thr15, Asp16, Leu99, Asp208, and Arg228) directly interact with the carbohydrate in both complexes (TableII).Table IIHydrogen bonding and polar contact distances (<3.5 Å) between trimannoside 1 and DGL and ConA as determined by x-ray crystallographySugar residueProtein/WaterDGL distancesConA distancesÅα(1,6) Man O-3Arg228N2.92.9 O-4Asn14 ND22.82.9 O-4Asp208 OD22.92.7 O-4Arg228 N3.2(3.5) O-5Leu99 N2.92.9 O-6Leu99N2.93.1 O-6Tyr100 N3.03.1 O-6Asp208 OD13.32.9Central Man O-2OW 392.82.6 O-2Asp16OD1(3.7)3.1 O-4Tyr12 OH2.72.8α(1,3) Man O-3Pro13 O3.02.9 O-3Thr15 N2.92.8 O-3Thr15OG2.92.9 O-4Thr15 OG12.63.1 O-4Asp16 N2.93.0 O-4Asp16OD12.93.3Data for ConA are from Naismith and Field (9Naismith J.H.

Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The α(1,6) Man residue of 1 binds to the “monosaccharide” binding site of DGL, which is a negatively charged pocket, while the central Man and α(1,3) Man residues fit into a shallower negatively charged grove. As shown in Fig. 5 A, two conserved residues, which contribute to the negatively charged surface, Asp16and Asp208, directly interact with the trimannoside. The side chain of Arg228 forms the only positively charged area on this surface. A conserved ordered water molecule (W39) is involved in the indirect interaction between the side chain of Arg228 and 1, which is also observed in ConA (9Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The presence of conserved ordered water molecules has also been observed in other members of the family of leguminous plant lectins (cf. 29). Fig. 6 shows the changes in the enthalpy (ΔΔH) of binding of DGL to deoxy analogs of1, relative to 1 (18Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and ConA (8Gupta D. Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6388-6392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Changes of ∼1 kcal mol−1 or greater in the ΔΔHvalues for individual deoxy analogs suggest loss of binding at the position of substitution. The predicted interactions of specific hydroxyls of 1 with ConA derived from the ΔΔHdata for lectin binding to the deoxy analogs has recently been shown to agree well with the x-ray crystal structure of the ConA complex with1 (Fig. 5) (9Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure in Fig. 5 Aand the thermodynamic data in Fig. 6 show that the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyls on the α(1,6) Man arm, the 2- and 4-hydroxyls of the central Man residue, and the 3- and 4-hydroxyls of the α(1,3) Man residue of 1 are involved in binding to ConA. The overall pattern of ΔΔH data for DGL binding to the deoxy analogs of 1 is similar to that for ConA (Fig. 6). Furthermore, with one exception, all of the interactions of DGL with1 indicated by the solution thermodynamic data are present in the crystal structure of the DGL complex (Fig. 5 A). The exception involves interactions at the 2-OH on the α(1–6) arm of1. Unlike ConA, which shows a small 0.7 kcal mol−1 change in ΔΔH for the 2-deoxy α(1,6) arm analog of 1 (relative to 1), the thermodynamic data for DGL indicates a significant change in ΔΔH (3.4 kcal mol−1) for the same analog, suggesting the involvement of the 2-hydroxyl on the α(1,6) arm of1 in binding. The crystal structure of the DGL complex with1, however, shows no direct protein-carbohydrate binding interactions at this site. The reduction in binding indicated by the thermodynamic data for the α(1,6) Man 2-deoxy analog appears to reflect indirect binding to the protein of the 2-hydroxyl at this position in 1 via a water molecule in the binding site. Details of this interaction are discussed below. Although the overall pattern of ΔΔH data for DGL in Fig. 6 is similar to that for ConA, the magnitude of the ΔΔHdata for certain analogs of the α(1,6) arm of 1 is different. Thus, the 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) Man analogs of1 possess ΔΔH values that are nearly twice as great for DGL (∼6.1 kcal mol−1) as for ConA (∼3.2 kcal mol−1). Table II lists the hydrogen bonding and polar contact residue assignments and distances for DGL and ConA with1. It is clear that the two protein complexes are nearly identical, both in terms of the residues involved in binding to1 as well as the number of hydrogen bonds and their distances to 1. Therefore, differences in the ΔΔH values of the two lectins for the 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) Man analogs of 1 are not due to differences in the direct lectin-carbohydrate hydrogen-bonding interactions (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the ∼2.9 kcal mol−1 difference in the average ΔΔH values for the 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) analogs binding to DGL (6.1 kcal mol−1) and to ConA (3.1 kcal mol−1) (Fig. 6) is nearly the same as the ∼2.7 kcal mol−1 difference in ΔΔH values for the 2-deoxy α(1,6) analog binding to DGL (3.4 kcal mol−1) versus to ConA (0.7 kcal mol−1) (Fig. 6). This suggests a common mechanism underlying the differences in the thermodynamics of binding of all four α(1–6) deoxy analogs to the two lectins. In this regard, it is interesting that the average ΔΔH values for the 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) analogs are nearly the same magnitude for each lectin. The relatively constant ΔΔH values of the 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) analogs for each lectin occur despite the different number and type of hydrogen bonds at each respective position in the parent trisaccharide. This further suggests a common thermodynamic mechanism of binding of the 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) analogs to each lectin. Fig. 7 shows the superposition of the atomic coordinates of the binding site regions of DGL and ConA for1. There are four amino acid differences found within a more extended area surrounding the ligand, which are residue 21 (Asn in DGL, Ser in ConA), residue 168 (Asn in DGL, Ser in ConA), residue 205 (Glu in DGL, His in ConA), and residue 226 (Gly in DGL, Thr in ConA). These residues are indirectly involved in ligand binding. They interact with a network of hydrogen-bonded ordered water molecules, which in turn directly interact with 1. As shown in Fig. 7, the largest deviation in ordered water molecule organization appears near the shift in residues 222–227. In ConA, the side chain of Thr226 is oriented to make direct hydrogen bond interactions with the ordered water molecule network, and the smaller side chain of Ser168 accommodates a water between itself and Thr226. In DGL, residue 226 is a Gly, and ordered water molecules fill the space of the missing side chain. Importantly, this network of hydrogen-bonded ordered water molecules directly interacts with the hydroxyl oxygens at positions 2 and 3 of the α(1,6) arm of 1, and thermodynamic data indicate that the strength and specificity of DGL and ConA binding differ at these positions in 1 (18Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the differences observed in the ΔΔH values for DGL and ConA binding to the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) Man analogs of 1 may be due to altered structural water molecules in this region of the binding sites of the lectins. Alternatively, DGL and ConA may undergo different conformational transitions upon binding 1 and the deoxy analogs that may contribute to the observed differences in the ΔΔH values of the analogs. In any case, it is clear that differences in the ΔΔH values of the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) Man analogs of 1 binding to DGL and ConA are not due to direct protein-ligand interactions. The x-ray structure of DGL with1, together with the ΔΔH data shown in Fig. 6, demonstrates that the enthalpy contributions to binding of individual hydroxyl groups of 1 determined from the corresponding monodeoxy analogs are nonlinear. For example, the magnitude of loss in ΔΔH values for DGL binding to the 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy α(1–6) Man analogs of 1, relative to1, are nonlinear. The ΔΔH value for the 3-deoxy α(1–6) Man analog is 5.5 kcal mol−1, and TableII shows that there is a single hydrogen bond from Arg228 N to the 3-OH of 1 at this position. On the other hand, the ΔΔH value for the 4-deoxy α(1–6) Man analog is 5.3 kcal mol−1, and Table II shows that there are three hydrogen bonds from the protein to the 4-OH at this position, involving Asn14 ND2, Asp208 OD2, and Arg228N. Similar nonlinear relationships exist between the magnitude of the ΔΔH data for the other deoxy analogs and the distances of the hydrogen bonds and the nature of the donor-acceptor pairs in the hydrogen bonds in Table II. Thus, the observed ΔΔH value for each deoxy analog does not represent direct measurements of the enthalpy contribution to binding at each hydroxyl group of1, but rather differential contributions of the solvent and protein to the thermodynamics of binding of the analogs. Similar conclusions can be made from the ΔΔG values for each analog (18Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings support similar conclusions regarding the nonlinear nature of the observed ΔΔH values of the deoxy analogs binding to DGL based on the relative loss in ΔΔH of a tetradeoxy analog of 1 as compared with the sum of the losses in ΔΔH of the corresponding monodeoxy analogs binding (18Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results confirm similar conclusions regarding the binding of ConA to deoxy analogs of 1 (8Gupta D. Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6388-6392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). While DGL and ConA possess similar high affinities for 1, isothermal titration microcalorimetry measurements show that ConA possesses 30-fold higher affinity for 2 than DGL (18Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The recently determined x-ray crystal structure of ConA complexed with2 reveals that the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue on the α(1,6) arm of the pentasaccharide fits into an extended groove of ConA and makes hydrogen-bond contacts on both sides of the sugar ring (25Moothoo D.N.

The specific interactions of the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue on the α(1,6) arm are between the 3-hydroxyl and the side chain of Thr226, the 4-hydroxyl and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly224, and the 7-hydroxyl and the side chain of Ser168 (TableIII). Superposition of the x-ray crystal structure of DGL bound to 1 onto that of ConA complex with2 reveals that proper contacts between DGL and the pentasaccharide are prevented due to key amino acid differences at residue 226 (Thr in ConA, Gly in DGL) and at residue 168 (Ser in ConA, Asn in DGL) and the shift in the backbone of residues 222–227 (Fig. 8).Table IIIInteractions of ConA and DGL with the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue on the α(1,6) arm of complex carbohydrate 2Sugar atomConA atomDistanceDGL atomDistanceGlcNAc O-3Thr226OG12.6 Å (hydrogen bond)Gly226(Missing side chain)GlcNAc O-4Gly224 O2.9 Å (hydrogen bond)Gly224 O4.0 Å (too far)GlcNAc O-7Ser168 OG2.6 Å (hydrogen bond)Asn168OD11.5 Å (too close)Data for ConA are from Moothoo and Naismith (25Moothoo D.N.

Superposition of the structure of trimannoside 1 in DGL with the structure of complex carbohydrate 2 bound to ConA (25Moothoo D.N. Naismith J.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is also shown in Fig. 8. Importantly, the core trimannoside moiety of2 bound to ConA deviates by less than 0.5 Å from the position of 1 bound to DGL, indicating similar binding of this moiety in both complexes. However, the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue on the α(1–6) arm of 2 modeled into DGL reveals contacts different from those observed in the ConA complex. In DGL, the side chain is missing from residue 226, and therefore no hydrogen-bond can be formed to the 3-hydroxyl of the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue. In addition, the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly224 is too far to make a proper hydrogen bond with the 4-hydroxyl of the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue, and the side chain of Asn168 is too large to accommodate a proper hydrogen bond to the 7-hydroxyl of the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue. These differences in the interactions of the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue on the α(1–6) arm of 2 in DGL appear to explain the 30-fold lower affinity of the lectin relative to ConA. The observed interactions of the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue on the α(1–3) arm of 2 in DGL (Fig. 8) suggest little interference in binding of this region of the complex. The contact differences for the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue on the α(1,6) arm of 2 in DGL and ConA also explain why DGL fails to bind the disaccharide GlcNAcβ(1–2)Man, while ConA binds well to the disaccharide (17Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The GlcNAcβ(1–2)Man moiety on the α(1,6) arm of2 occupies the so-called monosaccharide binding site in DGL. Therefore, the same unfavorable interactions would occur for the disaccharide. The favorable interactions observed in the ConA complex with 2 at this site explains the ability of the lectin to bind the disaccharide. These differences also appear to explain why ConA can bind longer chain analogs of 2, while DGL cannot. 3C. F. Brewer and T. S. Raju, unpublished results. The x-ray crystal structure of DGL complexed with trimannoside 1 has been determined to a resolution of 2.6 Å. The thermodynamics of DGL binding 1 and deoxy analogs of1 (18Dam T.K. Oscarson S.

With the exception of the lack of direct protein-carbohydrate contacts at the 2-OH position on the α(1,6) arm of 1 suggested by the thermodynamic data, the x-ray structure of the complex agrees with the thermodynamic data. The direct binding site contacts between DGL and 1 observed in the x-ray crystal structure are nearly identical to those for ConA and the core trimannoside (9Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Differences in the thermodynamics of binding of DGL and ConA to 1 and deoxy α(1,6) Man analogs of1 are not due to differences in direct lectin-carbohydrate interactions. Rather, these differences may be due to the altered location of ordered water molecules in the binding site and/or conformational changes outside of the binding site. Differences in the binding specificities of DGL and ConA for complex carbohydrate2 appear to be due to relatively unfavorable contact interactions of the β(1,2) GlcNAc residue on the α(1–6) arm of2 in DGL."

Polyomaviruses have proven to be powerful tools in the identification of key cellular regulatory proteins and the mechanisms that underlie their biological activities. The dependence on cellular machinery for a successful infection and the alterations in cellular processes promoting optimal conditions for viral multiplication have contributed to the utility of these viruses in identifying cellular regulatory proteins and pathways (1Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In particular, studies of the major regulatory protein encoded by polyomaviruses, large T-antigen (T-antigen), have provided major insights into cellular biochemical activities including regulation of viral DNA replication, transcriptional activation of both viral and cellular promoters, and cellular transformation (2Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).The human polyomavirus, JC virus (JCV),1 is the etiologic agent of the fatal subacute human neurodegenerative disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (reviewed in Ref. 3Major E.O. Amemiya K. Tornatore C.S. Houff S.A. Berger J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 5: 49-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Unlike SV40 and other polyomaviruses, JCV has a narrow tissue tropism. In immunocompromised patients, JCV lytically infects oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells in the central nervous system, and in tissue culture, JCV propagates efficiently only in primary human fetal glial cells. Studies from our and other laboratories have indicated that the cell-specific activation of the JCV promoter is determined at the level of viral gene transcription and requires multiple cellular proteins present in glial cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Raj G.V. Khalili K. Virology. 1995; 213: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One such cellular factor that influences JCV is Purα.Purα is a 322-amino acid sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein that has been implicated in the control of both DNA replication and transcription. There are several lines of evidence supporting a role for Purα in DNA replication. Purα was initially characterized as a HeLa cell nuclear protein that binds a sequence element, called the PUR element, adjacent to a region of stably bent DNA 1.6 kilobases upstream of the human c-myc gene (5Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Bergemann A.D. Ma Z.W. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This element is near the center of a region implicated as an initiation zone for chromosomal DNA replication. Moreover, PUR elements are present at several eukaryotic origins of DNA replication (5Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Purα has also been shown to interact with viral origins of DNA replication. Purα has been shown to bind the JCV and bovine papillomavirus origins of replication (7Chang C.F. Gallia G.L. Muralidharan V. Chen N.N. Zoltick P. Johnson E. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4150-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jurk M. Weissinger F. Lottspeich F. Schwarz U. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2799-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the biological activity of Purα on eukaryotic and bovine papillomavirus replication is yet undescribed, Purα has been shown to inhibit JCV DNA replication in glial cells (7Chang C.F. Gallia G.L. Muralidharan V. Chen N.N. Zoltick P. Johnson E. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4150-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Purα has also been implicated in control of gene transcription involving both viral and cellular promoters. Purα has been shown to activate several promoters, including the JCV early gene promoter (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the human immunodeficiency virus type I (10Chepenik L.G. Tretiakova A.P. Krachmarov C.P. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Gene. 1998; 210: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the myelin basic protein promoter (11Haas S. Thatikunta P. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the neuron-specific FE65 gene promoter (12Zambrano N. DeRenzis S. Minopoli G. Faraonio R. Donini V. Scaloni A. Cimino F. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, Purα has also been implicated in the expression of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene promoter (13Du Q. Tomkinson A.E. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the single-stranded cAMP response element (14Osugi T. Ding Y. Tanaka H. Kuo C.H. Do E. Irie Y. Miki N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the vascular smooth muscle α-actin gene promoter (15Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).In addition to its role in transcription and replication, there is evidence suggesting that Purα is involved in the control of cell growth and proliferation. Johnson et al. (16Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z.-W. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Purα binds the hypophosphorylated form of the human retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product pRb. Although the functional consequence of the interaction between these two proteins is yet undescribed, the selective interaction between Purα and the hypophosphorylated form of a protein intimately involved in cell cycle progression suggests a potentially crucial role in the cell cycle.With respect to JCV, we have previously demonstrated that Purα and T-antigen exert antagonistic effects on each other's transcriptional activity on the JCV promoter (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other polyomaviruses, the genome of JCV can be divided into an early region, which is expressed prior to the onset of viral DNA replication and encodes the viral regulatory proteins (the T-antigens), and the late region, which is expressed after viral DNA replication and encodes the viral capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) (reviewed in Ref. 17Frisque R.J. White FA. Roos R.P. Molecular Neurovirology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 25-158Crossref Google Scholar). The noncoding regulatory region, which contains the origin of viral DNA replication and the transcriptional control region, lies between the two coding regions. This transcriptional control region is composed of a bidirectional promoter/enhancer, with the JCV early promoter controlling expression of the early genes and the JCV late (JCVL) promoter directing transcription of the late genes. Purα has been shown to activate the JCV early promoter, and co-expression of JCV T-antigen decreases this Purα-induced increase in the level of JCV early gene transcription (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, Purα has been shown to abrogate JCV T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the JCVLpromoter (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, we examine the mechanism underlying the ability of Purα to abrogate JCV T-antigen-mediated transactivation of JCVL. Using co-immunoprecipitation and in vitroaffinity chromatography assays, we demonstrate that Purα associates with JCV T-antigen. In addition, we localize the region of Purα that is involved in this interaction. Transient transfection studies demonstrate that Purα and a Purα deletion mutant that retains the ability to interact with T-antigen abrogate T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the JCVL promoter. A mutant Purα that cannot interact with JCV T-antigen, however, is unable to attenuate JCV T-antigen-mediated transactivation of the JCVL promoter. Taken together, these data suggest that Purα and JCV T-antigen interact with one another and that this interaction modulates T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the late promoter of JC virus.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have demonstrated that the cellular protein Purα plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the JCV promoters (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, Purα stimulates transcription from the JCV early promoter. Moreover, T-antigen attenuates the Purα-induced level of early gene transcription. Although Purα has little effect on the late promoter itself, Purα is able to decrease T-antigen-mediated transcriptional transactivation of the JCVL promoter. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism responsible for the ability of Purα to abrogate the transcriptional activation of the JCVL promoter by T-antigen. Results from the current studies demonstrate that Purα interacts with JCV T-antigen in vivo and in vitro. Additional studies, including co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays, utilizing mice transgenic for JCV T-antigen (JC-91) have also demonstrated an interaction between these two proteins. 2A. Tretiakova et al., unpublished observations. Of note, the human and mouse Purα proteins exhibit a very high degree of conservation, differing by only two amino acids (26Ma Z.W. Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Gene. 1994; 149: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also demonstrate the Purα is able to interact with the T-antigen produced by another polyomavirus, SV40. Transient transfection assays demonstrate that a mutant Purα protein that retains the ability to interact with JCV T-antigen is, like the wild-type Purα protein, able to abrogate the JCV T-antigen-mediated transactivation of the JCVLpromoter. A mutant Purα protein that is unable to interact with JCV T-antigen, however, is not capable of attenuating the JCV T-antigen-induced transactivation of the JCVL promoter. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Purα and T-antigen interact both physically and functionally and that the interaction between these two protein modulates T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the late promoter of JCV.Several interesting observations can be made regarding the physical interaction between Purα and JCV T-antigen. JCV large T-antigen present in HJC-15b cells exists as several isoforms with different electrophoretic mobilities (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Because JCV T-antigen is a phosphoprotein with several phosphorylation sites (27Swenson J.J. Frisque R.J. Virology. 1995; 212: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), these different isoforms are believed to represent different phosphorylation states of the protein. Interestingly, Purα interacts with all of the isoforms of JCV T-antigen present in HJC-15b cells (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). This is in contrast to the interaction between Purα and another protein, which exists in different phosphorylated states, the product of the retinoblastoma gene, pRb. Johnson et al. (16Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z.-W. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Purα binds selectively to the hypophosphorylated form of pRb. The phosphorylation state of JCV T-antigen, however, may not dictate the association between Purα and JCV T-antigen as in vitro translated Purα interacts with GST-JCV T-antigen, which, being produced in bacteria, does not contain phosphorylated residues (Fig. 3). Nonetheless, future experiments will be required to elucidate the contribution of the phosphorylation state of JCV T-antigen to the intermolecular complex formed between Purα and JCV T-antigen.The transcriptional antagonism between JCV T-antigen and Purα is reminiscent of the interaction between the related SV40 large T-antigen and the tumor suppressor p53 protein. Several studies have demonstrated that SV40 T-antigen abrogates p53-mediated transcriptional activation (28Jiang D. Srinivasan A. Lozano G. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2805-2812PubMed Google Scholar, 29Meitz J.A. Unger T. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5013-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 30Segawa K. Minowa A. Sugasawa K. Takano T. Hanaoka F. Oncogene. 1992; 8: 543-548Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 has been shown to inhibit SV40 late promoter transactivation by SV40 T-antigen (31Deb S. Brown D.R. Lega H. Deb S.P. Int. J. Oncology. 1995; 6: 243-249PubMed Google Scholar). This is similar to the case of Purα and JCV T-antigen in that T-antigen abrogates Purα-mediated transcriptional transactivation, and Purα inhibits JCV T-antigen-mediated transactivation of the JCV late promoter (Ref. 9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this study). The interaction between SV40 T-antigen and p53 not only has functional consequences with respect to transcription, but this interaction has also been shown to regulate replication. SV40 T-antigen, when complexed with p53, has been shown to be unable to replicate an SV40 origin-containing DNA (32Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9275-9279Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Wang E.H. Friedman P.N. Prives C. Cell. 1989; 57: 379-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p53 has been shown to inhibit JCV DNA replication by interacting with JCV T-antigen (34Staib C. Pesch J. Gerwig R. Gerber J.K. Brehm U. Stangl A. Grummt F. Virology. 1996; 219: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of the interaction between Purα and T-antigen with respect to DNA replication is yet undescribed, the results reported here invite investigation into the functional relevance of the interaction between these two proteins in other well characterized functions of T-antigen.Another well characterized function of viral oncoproteins including large T-antigen is cellular transformation. One mechanism by which these proteins are able to cause cellular transformation is via their interaction with the products of cellular tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and pRb. Several viral oncoptroteins have been shown to interact with p53, including JCV T-antigen (34Staib C. Pesch J. Gerwig R. Gerber J.K. Brehm U. Stangl A. Grummt F. Virology. 1996; 219: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Bollag B. Chuke W.F. Frisque R.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 863-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SV40 T-antigen (36Lane D.P.

Science. 1990; 248: L76-L79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). The interaction between these proteins and p53 results in functional inactivation, as in the case of T-antigen, or increased p53 turnover, as in the case of human papillomavirus E6. Similar to p53, pRb is targeted by several different transforming viruses and is complexed with JCV T-antigen (40Dyson N. Bernards R. Friend S.H. Gooding L.R. Hassell J.A. Major E.O. Pipas J.M.

These observations are interesting in light of our results demonstrating an interaction between JCV and SV40 large T-antigens with the cellular protein Purα. This raises interesting questions regarding the cellular role of Purα. Interestingly, overexpression of Purα causes growth inhibitionin vitro. 3G. L. Gallia et al., unpublished observations. This is particularly noteworthy in light of several observations regarding Purα. The gene encoding Purα, PURA, has been localized to human chromosome band 5q31 (44Ma Z.W. Pejovic T. Najfeld V. Ward D.C. Johnson E.M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1995; 71: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Loss of heterozygosity at 5q31 is frequently associated with hematologic malignancies particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloid leukemias (45LeBeau M.M. Espinosa 3rd, R. Neuman W.L. Stock W. Roulston D. Larson R.A. Keinanen M. Westbrook C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 46Pedersen B. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1913-1916PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the recent demonstration of PURA gene deletions in many cases of myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome suggest that Purα may also be involved in tumor development (47Lezon-Geyda K.A. Najfeld V. Johnson E.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: A100Google Scholar).In this report, we demonstrate that Purα interacts with the large T-antigen of JCV and SV40. In addition, we localize the region of Purα that is important for its interaction in JCV T-antigen. Using transient transfection assays, we also demonstrate that these two proteins interact functionally as well. Full-length Purα and a deletion mutant that retains the ability to interact with JCV T-antigen abrogate T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation. A Purα deletion mutant that is unable to interact with JCV T-antigen, however, is incapable of alternating the transcriptional activation of JCV T-antigen. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a physical interaction underlies the functional antagonism between these two proteins. Polyomaviruses have proven to be powerful tools in the identification of key cellular regulatory proteins and the mechanisms that underlie their biological activities. The dependence on cellular machinery for a successful infection and the alterations in cellular processes promoting optimal conditions for viral multiplication have contributed to the utility of these viruses in identifying cellular regulatory proteins and pathways (1Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In particular, studies of the major regulatory protein encoded by polyomaviruses, large T-antigen (T-antigen), have provided major insights into cellular biochemical activities including regulation of viral DNA replication, transcriptional activation of both viral and cellular promoters, and cellular transformation (2Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The human polyomavirus, JC virus (JCV),1 is the etiologic agent of the fatal subacute human neurodegenerative disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (reviewed in Ref. 3Major E.O. Amemiya K. Tornatore C.S. Houff S.A. Berger J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 5: 49-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Unlike SV40 and other polyomaviruses, JCV has a narrow tissue tropism. In immunocompromised patients, JCV lytically infects oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells in the central nervous system, and in tissue culture, JCV propagates efficiently only in primary human fetal glial cells. Studies from our and other laboratories have indicated that the cell-specific activation of the JCV promoter is determined at the level of viral gene transcription and requires multiple cellular proteins present in glial cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Raj G.V. Khalili K. Virology. 1995; 213: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One such cellular factor that influences JCV is Purα. Purα is a 322-amino acid sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein that has been implicated in the control of both DNA replication and transcription. There are several lines of evidence supporting a role for Purα in DNA replication. Purα was initially characterized as a HeLa cell nuclear protein that binds a sequence element, called the PUR element, adjacent to a region of stably bent DNA 1.6 kilobases upstream of the human c-myc gene (5Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Bergemann A.D. Ma Z.W. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This element is near the center of a region implicated as an initiation zone for chromosomal DNA replication. Moreover, PUR elements are present at several eukaryotic origins of DNA replication (5Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Purα has also been shown to interact with viral origins of DNA replication. Purα has been shown to bind the JCV and bovine papillomavirus origins of replication (7Chang C.F. Gallia G.L. Muralidharan V. Chen N.N. Zoltick P. Johnson E. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4150-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jurk M. Weissinger F. Lottspeich F. Schwarz U. Winnacker E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2799-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the biological activity of Purα on eukaryotic and bovine papillomavirus replication is yet undescribed, Purα has been shown to inhibit JCV DNA replication in glial cells (7Chang C.F. Gallia G.L. Muralidharan V. Chen N.N. Zoltick P. Johnson E. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4150-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purα has also been implicated in control of gene transcription involving both viral and cellular promoters. Purα has been shown to activate several promoters, including the JCV early gene promoter (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the human immunodeficiency virus type I (10Chepenik L.G. Tretiakova A.P. Krachmarov C.P. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Gene. 1998; 210: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the myelin basic protein promoter (11Haas S. Thatikunta P. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the neuron-specific FE65 gene promoter (12Zambrano N. DeRenzis S. Minopoli G. Faraonio R. Donini V. Scaloni A. Cimino F. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, Purα has also been implicated in the expression of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene promoter (13Du Q. Tomkinson A.E. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the single-stranded cAMP response element (14Osugi T. Ding Y. Tanaka H. Kuo C.H. Do E. Irie Y. Miki N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the vascular smooth muscle α-actin gene promoter (15Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in transcription and replication, there is evidence suggesting that Purα is involved in the control of cell growth and proliferation. Johnson et al. (16Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z.-W. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Purα binds the hypophosphorylated form of the human retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product pRb. Although the functional consequence of the interaction between these two proteins is yet undescribed, the selective interaction between Purα and the hypophosphorylated form of a protein intimately involved in cell cycle progression suggests a potentially crucial role in the cell cycle. With respect to JCV, we have previously demonstrated that Purα and T-antigen exert antagonistic effects on each other's transcriptional activity on the JCV promoter (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other polyomaviruses, the genome of JCV can be divided into an early region, which is expressed prior to the onset of viral DNA replication and encodes the viral regulatory proteins (the T-antigens), and the late region, which is expressed after viral DNA replication and encodes the viral capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) (reviewed in Ref. 17Frisque R.J. White FA. Roos R.P. Molecular Neurovirology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 25-158Crossref Google Scholar). The noncoding regulatory region, which contains the origin of viral DNA replication and the transcriptional control region, lies between the two coding regions. This transcriptional control region is composed of a bidirectional promoter/enhancer, with the JCV early promoter controlling expression of the early genes and the JCV late (JCVL) promoter directing transcription of the late genes. Purα has been shown to activate the JCV early promoter, and co-expression of JCV T-antigen decreases this Purα-induced increase in the level of JCV early gene transcription (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, Purα has been shown to abrogate JCV T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the JCVLpromoter (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we examine the mechanism underlying the ability of Purα to abrogate JCV T-antigen-mediated transactivation of JCVL. Using co-immunoprecipitation and in vitroaffinity chromatography assays, we demonstrate that Purα associates with JCV T-antigen. In addition, we localize the region of Purα that is involved in this interaction. Transient transfection studies demonstrate that Purα and a Purα deletion mutant that retains the ability to interact with T-antigen abrogate T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the JCVL promoter. A mutant Purα that cannot interact with JCV T-antigen, however, is unable to attenuate JCV T-antigen-mediated transactivation of the JCVL promoter. Taken together, these data suggest that Purα and JCV T-antigen interact with one another and that this interaction modulates T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the late promoter of JC virus. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have demonstrated that the cellular protein Purα plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the JCV promoters (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, Purα stimulates transcription from the JCV early promoter. Moreover, T-antigen attenuates the Purα-induced level of early gene transcription. Although Purα has little effect on the late promoter itself, Purα is able to decrease T-antigen-mediated transcriptional transactivation of the JCVL promoter. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism responsible for the ability of Purα to abrogate the transcriptional activation of the JCVL promoter by T-antigen. Results from the current studies demonstrate that Purα interacts with JCV T-antigen in vivo and in vitro. Additional studies, including co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays, utilizing mice transgenic for JCV T-antigen (JC-91) have also demonstrated an interaction between these two proteins. 2A. Tretiakova et al., unpublished observations. Of note, the human and mouse Purα proteins exhibit a very high degree of conservation, differing by only two amino acids (26Ma Z.W. Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Gene. 1994; 149: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also demonstrate the Purα is able to interact with the T-antigen produced by another polyomavirus, SV40. Transient transfection assays demonstrate that a mutant Purα protein that retains the ability to interact with JCV T-antigen is, like the wild-type Purα protein, able to abrogate the JCV T-antigen-mediated transactivation of the JCVLpromoter. A mutant Purα protein that is unable to interact with JCV T-antigen, however, is not capable of attenuating the JCV T-antigen-induced transactivation of the JCVL promoter. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Purα and T-antigen interact both physically and functionally and that the interaction between these two protein modulates T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation of the late promoter of JCV.Several interesting observations can be made regarding the physical interaction between Purα and JCV T-antigen. JCV large T-antigen present in HJC-15b cells exists as several isoforms with different electrophoretic mobilities (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Because JCV T-antigen is a phosphoprotein with several phosphorylation sites (27Swenson J.J. Frisque R.J. Virology. 1995; 212: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), these different isoforms are believed to represent different phosphorylation states of the protein. Interestingly, Purα interacts with all of the isoforms of JCV T-antigen present in HJC-15b cells (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). This is in contrast to the interaction between Purα and another protein, which exists in different phosphorylated states, the product of the retinoblastoma gene, pRb. Johnson et al. (16Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z.-W. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Purα binds selectively to the hypophosphorylated form of pRb. The phosphorylation state of JCV T-antigen, however, may not dictate the association between Purα and JCV T-antigen as in vitro translated Purα interacts with GST-JCV T-antigen, which, being produced in bacteria, does not contain phosphorylated residues (Fig. 3). Nonetheless, future experiments will be required to elucidate the contribution of the phosphorylation state of JCV T-antigen to the intermolecular complex formed between Purα and JCV T-antigen.The transcriptional antagonism between JCV T-antigen and Purα is reminiscent of the interaction between the related SV40 large T-antigen and the tumor suppressor p53 protein. Several studies have demonstrated that SV40 T-antigen abrogates p53-mediated transcriptional activation (28Jiang D. Srinivasan A. Lozano G. Robbins P.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2805-2812PubMed Google Scholar, 29Meitz J.A. Unger T. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5013-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 30Segawa K. Minowa A. Sugasawa K. Takano T. Hanaoka F. Oncogene. 1992; 8: 543-548Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 has been shown to inhibit SV40 late promoter transactivation by SV40 T-antigen (31Deb S. Brown D.R. Lega H. Deb S.P. Int. J. Oncology. 1995; 6: 243-249PubMed Google Scholar). This is similar to the case of Purα and JCV T-antigen in that T-antigen abrogates Purα-mediated transcriptional transactivation, and Purα inhibits JCV T-antigen-mediated transactivation of the JCV late promoter (Ref. 9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this study). The interaction between SV40 T-antigen and p53 not only has functional consequences with respect to transcription, but this interaction has also been shown to regulate replication. SV40 T-antigen, when complexed with p53, has been shown to be unable to replicate an SV40 origin-containing DNA (32Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9275-9279Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Wang E.H. Friedman P.N. Prives C. Cell. 1989; 57: 379-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p53 has been shown to inhibit JCV DNA replication by interacting with JCV T-antigen (34Staib C. Pesch J. Gerwig R. Gerber J.K. Brehm U. Stangl A. Grummt F. Virology. 1996; 219: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of the interaction between Purα and T-antigen with respect to DNA replication is yet undescribed, the results reported here invite investigation into the functional relevance of the interaction between these two proteins in other well characterized functions of T-antigen.Another well characterized function of viral oncoproteins including large T-antigen is cellular transformation. One mechanism by which these proteins are able to cause cellular transformation is via their interaction with the products of cellular tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and pRb. Several viral oncoptroteins have been shown to interact with p53, including JCV T-antigen (34Staib C. Pesch J. Gerwig R. Gerber J.K. Brehm U. Stangl A. Grummt F. Virology. 1996; 219: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Bollag B. Chuke W.F. Frisque R.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 863-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SV40 T-antigen (36Lane D.P. Crawford L.V. Nature. 1979; 278: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 37Linzer D.I.H. Levine A.J.

Science. 1990; 248: L76-L79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). The interaction between these proteins and p53 results in functional inactivation, as in the case of T-antigen, or increased p53 turnover, as in the case of human papillomavirus E6. Similar to p53, pRb is targeted by several different transforming viruses and is complexed with JCV T-antigen (40Dyson N. Bernards R. Friend S.H. Gooding L.R. Hassell J.A. Major E.O. Pipas J.M.

Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). These observations are interesting in light of our results demonstrating an interaction between JCV and SV40 large T-antigens with the cellular protein Purα. This raises interesting questions regarding the cellular role of Purα. Interestingly, overexpression of Purα causes growth inhibitionin vitro. 3G. L. Gallia et al., unpublished observations. This is particularly noteworthy in light of several observations regarding Purα. The gene encoding Purα, PURA, has been localized to human chromosome band 5q31 (44Ma Z.W. Pejovic T. Najfeld V. Ward D.C. Johnson E.M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1995; 71: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Loss of heterozygosity at 5q31 is frequently associated with hematologic malignancies particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloid leukemias (45LeBeau M.M. Espinosa 3rd, R. Neuman W.L. Stock W. Roulston D. Larson R.A. Keinanen M. Westbrook C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 46Pedersen B. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1913-1916PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the recent demonstration of PURA gene deletions in many cases of myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome suggest that Purα may also be involved in tumor development (47Lezon-Geyda K.A. Najfeld V. Johnson E.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: A100Google Scholar).In this report, we demonstrate that Purα interacts with the large T-antigen of JCV and SV40. In addition, we localize the region of Purα that is important for its interaction in JCV T-antigen. Using transient transfection assays, we also demonstrate that these two proteins interact functionally as well. Full-length Purα and a deletion mutant that retains the ability to interact with JCV T-antigen abrogate T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation. A Purα deletion mutant that is unable to interact with JCV T-antigen, however, is incapable of alternating the transcriptional activation of JCV T-antigen. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a physical interaction underlies the functional antagonism between these two proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cellular protein Purα plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the JCV promoters (9Chen N.N. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5843-5848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, Purα stimulates transcription from the JCV early promoter.

Ward D.C. Johnson E.M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1995; 71: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Loss of heterozygosity at 5q31 is frequently associated with hematologic malignancies particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloid leukemias (45LeBeau M.M. Espinosa 3rd, R. Neuman W.L. Stock W. Roulston D. Larson R.A. Keinanen M. Westbrook C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 46Pedersen B. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 1913-1916PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the recent demonstration of PURA gene deletions in many cases of myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome suggest that Purα may also be involved in tumor development (47Lezon-Geyda K.A. Najfeld V. Johnson E.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: A100Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that Purα interacts with the large T-antigen of JCV and SV40. In addition, we localize the region of Purα that is important for its interaction in JCV T-antigen. Using transient transfection assays, we also demonstrate that these two proteins interact functionally as well. Full-length Purα and a deletion mutant that retains the ability to interact with JCV T-antigen abrogate T-antigen-mediated transcriptional activation. A Purα deletion mutant that is unable to interact with JCV T-antigen, however, is incapable of alternating the transcriptional activation of JCV T-antigen. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a physical interaction underlies the functional antagonism between these two proteins.

The LolA-dependent release of lipoproteins is critical for lipoprotein sorting as it depends on the outer membrane-specific sorting signal. To clarify molecular events involved in the LolA-dependent lipoprotein release, we attempted to establish an in vitro assay system. The major outer membrane lipoprotein (Lpp) was found to lose its release competence soon after being processed to mature Lpp in the inner membrane and therefore could not be used as a substrate for an in vitrosystem. An Lpp derivative, L10P, was constructed and found to retain the release competence long after its maturation. L10P was synthesized and radiolabeled in spheroplasts in the absence of LolA; therefore, it remained anchored to the inner membrane of spheroplasts. Right-side out membrane vesicles containing L10P were then prepared and used to examine the release of L10P. In addition to LolA, L10P release absolutely required nucleoside triphosphate (NTP). A non-hydrolyzable NTP analogue strongly inhibited the NTP-dependent release. The outer membrane-specific sorting signal was essential for thein vitro release of L10P. Furthermore, L10P releasedin vitro was specifically incorporated into the outer membrane. These results indicate that the in vitro release of L10P represents an in vivo reaction and requires energy.

Lipid-modified proteins such as Rab in eukaryotes (1Simons K. Zerial M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 789-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and lipoproteins in bacteria (2Hayashi S.

Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been studied with respect to post-translational modification pathways, physiological significance, and membrane targeting mechanisms. Cys residues at the N termini of lipoproteins and in the C-terminal region of Rab are modified with lipids, which anchor these proteins to the target membranes. Vesicular transport requires correct membrane targeting of Rab (1Simons K. Zerial M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 789-799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and the mislocation of lipoprotein is lethal to Escherichia coli(4Yakushi T. Tajima T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).More lipoproteins than known are predicted by the complete genome sequence to be present in E. coli (5Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5967) Google Scholar). All lipoproteins are thought to be synthesized with a signal peptide at the N terminus and then to be translocated across the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane in a Sec machinery-dependent manner (3Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid modification and processing to mature lipoproteins take place in the inner membrane, and the localization of a mature lipoprotein to either the inner or outer membrane follows. The amino acid residue next to the lipid-modified Cys at the N terminus of a mature lipoprotein functions as a sorting signal (6Yamaguchi K., Yu, F. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). An Asp residue at this position makes lipoproteins specific to the inner membrane, whereas other residues direct lipoproteins to the outer membrane.A periplasmic chaperone, LolA (7Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), mediates the release of the outer membrane-directed lipoproteins from the inner membrane by forming a soluble lipoprotein-LolA complex. Inner membrane-specific lipoproteins remain anchored to the inner membrane in the presence of LolA, indicating that the formation of the lipoprotein-LolA complex represents a critical step of the lipoprotein sorting (7Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). When the complex interacts with an outer membrane receptor, LolB, the lipoprotein is transferred from the complex to LolB and then incorporated into the outer membrane (8Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). LolB is also a lipoprotein possessing the outer membrane sorting signal and is essential forE. coli (8Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). An in vitro assay system has been constructed to examine the interaction between the lipoprotein-LolA complex and LolB (8Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The LolA-dependent release of lipoproteins was examined in spheroplasts (7Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although a proton motive force was found to be unnecessary for LolA release (7Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), a possible energy requirement for the release step has not been ruled out. Furthermore, since LolA forms a complex with a lipoprotein existing in the inner membrane but not with an outer membrane-localized lipoprotein, it seems highly likely that a factor involved in the lipoprotein-LolA complex formation is present in the inner membrane.We report here the establishment of an in vitro assay system for lipoprotein release. By using this system, we found that the release of lipoprotein from the inner membrane requires nucleoside triphosphate.DISCUSSIONWe constructed seven Lpp derivatives by substituting a hydrophobic residue with Arg or Pro. The post-processing release competence of most derivatives was found to be significantly enhanced. In vivoexpression of all the derivatives had no effect on the growth of the cells. Furthermore, three derivatives were found to be correctly localized to the outer membrane in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that all the mutations introduced into Lpp do not affect the interaction with LolA and LolB, both of which play critical roles in the outer membrane localization of lipoproteins. Anin vitro assay system was successfully constructed with L10P as a substrate, whereas the wild type Lpp could not be used as the substrate for it, suggesting that the stable trimer formation renders Lpp incompetent as to post-processing release. However, it is not completely clear whether or not the loss of release competence is directly caused by the trimerization, as the formation of the L10P trimer was not examined. It is noteworthy that the trimerization of Lpp in the inner membrane rarely takes place in vivo since thein vivo release most likely occurs in a co-processing manner.The following observations strongly indicate that the in vitro release of L10P represents the physiological release: 1) thein vitro release of L10P depends on the outer membrane sorting signal; 2) L10P released in vitro is incorporated into the outer membrane in a LolB-dependent manner; and 3) not only L10P but also Pal is released in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner.The release of L10P from right-side out membrane vesicles was found to require nucleoside triphosphate, suggesting the existence of an inner membrane factor involved in the release of lipoproteins. The inhibition of the ATP-dependent L10P release by AMP-PNP, AMP-CPP, and AMP-PCP suggests that both α-β and β-γ phosphoester bonds are important for the reaction. Vanadate, which is known as an inhibitor of P-type ATPase, completely inhibited the L10P release. It is still premature to discuss, based on these observations, the type of nucleoside triphosphatase involved in the reaction, although Sec factors such as SecA are not involved in the release reaction. It is, however, noteworthy that the presence of a factor in the inner membrane is critical for the one-way transport of lipoproteins from the inner to the outer membrane, i.e. LolA never releases lipoproteins from the outer membrane.Formation of the lipoprotein-LolA complex depends on the outer membrane sorting signal (7Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which is located at the N-terminal second position (6Yamaguchi K., Yu, F. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). LolA is therefore thought to recognize the sorting signal (7Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that an inner membrane factor recognizes the sorting signal and releases the outer membrane-specific lipoprotein upon NTP hydrolysis, thereby enabling a water-soluble lipoprotein-LolA complex to form. Hydrolysis of ATP, which is coupled to L10P release, was not detected with right-side out membrane vesicles, presumably because of the limited amount of L10P. It is therefore not clear whether the product of ATP hydrolysis is ADP or AMP. We recently succeeded in the reconstitution of a lipoprotein releasing system into proteoliposomes. Characterization of the putative inner membrane factor and its ATP hydrolyzing activity are under investigation. Lipid-modified proteins such as Rab in eukaryotes (1Simons K. Zerial M.

https://openalex.org/W2149027585,"Two murine DNA methyltransferase isoforms (MTases) have been observed, a longer form in somatic and embryonic stem (ES) cells and a shorter form in oocytes and preimplantation embryos. While the longer MTase is associated with maintenance methyltransferase activity in replicating cells, little is known about the shorter form. We present genetic and biochemical evidence that both isoforms are expressed from the same Dnmt1gene by using different translation initiation sites in exons 1 and 4. We further demonstrate that the shorter isoform can functionally rescue Dnmt1 null ES cells that have a hypomethylated genome. These rescued ES cells differentiate in vivo into a variety of cell types, unlike the Dnmt1 null ES cells that die upon induction of differentiation. These results show that the shorter isoform can substitute for the longer maintenance MTase in ES and differentiated cells. Our data further indicate that the shorter MTase isoform found in oocytes is fully functional in vivo and may play an active role in the regulation of DNA methylation and the establishment of imprinting patterns.

DNA (cytosine-5)-methylation is essential for normal mammalian development as Dnmt1 null mouse embryos fail to maintain cytosine methylation and die at mid-gestation (1Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Dnmt1 encodes the enzyme DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (MTase)1, which methylates hemi-methylated DNA to maintain methylation patterns following DNA replication (2Gruenbaum Y. Cedar H. Razin A.

DNA methylation patterns are inherited from both parents and are mostly erased during preimplantation development, when the genome undergoes global demethylation. After implantation, somatic cells are remethylated, whereas primordial germ cells remain hypomethylated until gametogenesis when their genome becomes remethylated again (8Razin A. Shemer R. Hum. Mol.

This MTase is believed to maintain methylation patterns in somatic and ES cells. Interestingly, a shorter MTase form with an apparent molecular mass of about 170 kDa was found in differentiating female germ cells (oocytes) and in preimplantation embryos, which correlates with the occurrence of an oocyte-specific, alternatively spliced Dnmt1mRNA (13Carlson L.L. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2536-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14Mertineit C. Yoder J.A. Taketo T. Laird D.W. Trasler J.M. Bestor T.H. Development. 1998; 125: 889-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study possible mechanisms regulating DNA methylation during early development, it is necessary to determine which isoforms are expressed and to test their activity in vivo. The present work established that the Dnmt1 gene contains at least four in-frame ATGs which could potentially be used to generate multiple MTase isoforms. We show that the longer isoform present in ES cells and somatic tissues starts at ATG3 in exon one, and the shorter isoform present in oocytes and preimplantation embryos starts at ATG4 in exon four. This shorter isoform is fully active in vivoand can restore wild-type DNA methylation levels and the capacity to differentiate Dnmt1 null ES cells. The fact that the shorter, oocyte-specific isoform can substitute for the somatic form suggests that it plays an active role in the regulation of DNA methylation during early development. Site-directed mutations were introduced in the Dnmt1 minigene using the previously described plasmid pMT50 (15Tucker K.L. Talbot D. Lee M.A. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ATG mutant constructs pMTΔ1,2 (mutated ATG1,2), pMTΔ3 (mutated ATG3), and pMTΔ1,2,3 (mutated ATG1,2,3) were generated using standard PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis with mutant primers overlapping ATG1,2 or ATG3: Δ1,2-upper primer, 5′-GCCTCCGTTGCGCGCtTGCGCACTCCCTTCGGGCATAGCtTGGTCTTCCCCCACTCT-3′; Δ3-upper primer, 5′-CCTGCAAGtTGCCAGCGCGAACAGC-3′; Δ1,2-lower primer, 5′-AGAGTGGGGGAAGACCAaGCTATGCCCGAAGGGAGTGCGCAaGCGCGCAACGGAGGC-3′; and Δ3-lower primer, 5′-GCTGTTCGCGCTGGCAaCTTGCAGG-3′. The respective mutations are indicated in lower case letters. For subcloning of mutated PCR fragments, two flanking primers were chosen that are located at suitable, nearby restriction sites (theBstXI-upper primer, 5′-GAGTTCCAGAAATATGGATCATGGAC-3′ (located 859-bp upstream of ATG1), and the EagI-lower primer, 5′-CAGCGGCCGtAGGGCCACCCGGAGAT-3′ (located 139-bp downstream of ATG3)). The EagI-lower primer contains a mutation in the NotI site which results in anEagI site (mutation shown in lowercase). The PCR fragment containing the mutated ATG1,2 was used to perform a second round of mutagenesis, thereby generating an ATG1,2,3 mutant PCR product. The final mutated PCR products (1210 bp) were cut withBstXI/EagI and cloned into theBstXI/NotI site of pMT50–7/EagI, resulting in pMT50–7/EagI/Δ1,2, pMT50–7/EagI/Δ3, and pMT50–7/EagI/Δ1,2,3. The pMT50/7 construct was generated by religating the 7-kb DNA fragment from a NotI-cut pMT50. The pMTΔ4 (mutated ATG4) construct was made using the same strategy. The Δ4-upper primer, 5′-GGAGAGCAGAAtTGGCAGACTCAA-3′, and Δ4-lower primer, 5′-TTGAGTCTGCCAaTTCTGCTCTCC-3′, were used to mutate ATG4. Fragments were amplified for subcloning with the EcoRI-upper primer, 5′-GCGCAGCTAGGCATCTTAGTTATG-3′ (located 414-bp upstream of ATG4), and the EcoRI-lower primer, 5′-CGGGAATTCGGACGTCGAAGACTCCTGTTGTC-3′ (located 349-bp downstream of ATG4). The final mutant PCR product (820 bp) was digested withEcoRI and ligated into the 13.1-kb fragment of EcoRI-cut pMT50-EagI (same as pMT50 exceptNotI site downstream of ATG3 was mutated to anEagI site), resulting in pMT50-EagI/13.1-kb-Δ4. This construct was cut with AatII, and the 11-kb fragment was ligated to the 7.1-kb fragment of AatII-cut pMT50, resulting in pMTΔ4. The presence of site-directed mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type J1 and Dnmt1s/s mutant ES cells were cultured as described (1Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar,16Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were done using the cationic liposome reagent DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim). Plasmid DNA (7.5 μg each) was linearized by cleavage at a NotI site to favor random integration. DNA was mixed with 45 μl of DOTAP for 15 min at room temperature in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and added to 4 × 106 ES cells in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h at 37 °C. The pPgk-Puro plasmid (17Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H. Li E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) (0.5 μg) was used in all transfections as a selection marker (puromycin). ES cells were plated on irradiated puro-resistant murine fetal fibroblasts, and puromycin was added at 2 μg/ml 24 h after transfection. Clones were picked and expanded 11–14 days after the addition of puromycin. Genomic DNA was made and analyzed as described (17Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H. Li E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (10 μg each) was digested with the restriction enzyme HpaII and loaded on agarose gel, electrophoresed, and blotted onto Zetabind nylon membranes using standard procedures (18Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar) An [α-32P]dCTP-labeled minor satellite centromeric repeat probe was used for detection (pMR150; Ref. 19Chapman V. Forrester L. Sanford J. Hastie N. Rossant J. Nature. 1984; 307: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar; gift from V. Chapman, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY). Teratomas were generated by resuspending 107 ES cells (grown in the presence of 1000 units/ml LIF and without embryonic fibroblasts) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. ES cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 2-month old 129/sv male mice (300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/ES cells per injection). Teratomas were excised 3 weeks after injections for Western blot and histological analysis. Peptides were synthesized with an additional cysteine residue on the N-terminal end as follows: ATG2-Ab, CCFRLRRPLPIGFRAREK; ATG3-Ab, CDHVRRRLKDLERDGLTEKE; and ATG4-Ab, CRSPRSRPKPRGPRRSK. Peptides were coupled to KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) via the cysteine residue and injected into chickens (ATG2-Ab and ATG3-Ab) or New Zealand White rabbits (ATG4-Ab) using standard protocols (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 92-115Google Scholar). For ATG2-Ab and ATG3-Ab, antibodies were purified from egg yolk using the Eggstract purification system (Promega). The C-terminal antibody was raised against the catalytic domain (amino acids 1088 to 1619) fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant protein was purified over an amylose-agarose affinity column and eluted with maltose. Purified protein was injected into chickens using standard protocols (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 92-115Google Scholar), and antibodies were purified from yolk as described above. To remove unspecific antibodies binding MBP epitopes, the mix was passed over a column carrying the immobilized catalytic MBP domain. Antibodies were stored at 4 °C with sodium azide. Antibody specificity was tested against recombinant MTases made from baculoviruses (21Pradhan S. Talbot D. Sha M. Benner J. Hornstra L. Li E. Jaenisch R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4666-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2, left panels). ES cells were harvested in 10 volumes of sample buffer (2% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue), sonicated, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on an 8% SDS-PAGE as described (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). Two-cell embryos, eight-cell embryos, and blastocysts were harvested in the same buffer. Coomassie staining and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (23Vassalli A. Matzuk M.M. Gardner H.A. Lee K.F. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). All antibodies were diluted 1:3000 and detected using the chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). J1 embryonic stem cells were grown under standard conditions in the presence of 1000 units/ml LIF (1Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar, 16Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1 × 1010 cells were harvested by scraping, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (24Bestor T.H. Ingram V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5559-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Dialyzed extract was loaded onto a Q Sepharose fast flow ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a salt gradient from 20 to 1000 mm NaCl (peak at 280 mm). MTase protein was monitored by Western blot analysis using the ATG4-Ab in all chromatography steps. The pooled fractions were diluted to 150 mm NaCl, loaded onto a heparin column, and eluted with a 150–2000 mm NaCl gradient (peak at 550 mm NaCl). Pooled fractions were diluted to 100 mm NaCl and loaded onto a High Q column and eluted with a 100–1000 mm NaCl gradient (peak at 280 mm). Positive fractions were concentrated by loading onto a High Q column and eluted with 1000 mm NaCl. Fractions were stored on ice until N-terminal sequencing. For sequencing, purified MTase was electrophoresed using standard protein sequencing conditions on SDS-PAGE, and the gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining with Coomassie Blue, the protein band was excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing on a 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analysis. Recent reports of additional 5′-cDNA sequences of the mouse Dnmt1 gene differed by one frameshift, which alters the number of possible upstream ATGs (15Tucker K.L. Talbot D. Lee M.A. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Yoder J.A. Yen R.-W.C. Vertino P.M. Bestor T.H. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31092-31097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because this discrepancy has potential consequences for the structure of the N-terminal, regulatory domain, we sequenced the corresponding genomic DNA of the mouse Dnmt1 gene. To rule out strain-specific differences and PCR artifacts, we used genomic DNA from three different sources, the MEL cell line and tissues from two mouse strains (129/sv and BALB/c). Our data unequivocally show that the 5′-end of theDnmt1 gene contains three additional in-frame ATGs in all mouse DNAs tested (see ATG1–3 in Fig. 1) and thus confirm our previous observation (15Tucker K.L. Talbot D. Lee M.A. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, ATG2, ATG3, and ATG4 have all the requirements for efficient translation initiation described by Kozak (26Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). To determine which of these four potential ATGs are used in vivo for translation initiation, we generated antibodies specific for the regions between: ATG2 and ATG3 (referred to as ATG2-Ab); ATG3 and ATG4 (referred to as ATG3-Ab); downstream of ATG4 (referred to as ATG4-Ab) (Fig. 1 B). The specificity of these antibodies was tested on recombinant MTases produced in a baculovirus expression system starting at either ATG2, ATG3, or ATG4 (Fig. 2, left panel). These antibodies were used to probe protein extracts from various mouse tissues including kidney, brain, thymus, and ES cells. ATG2-Ab failed to produce a signal in all tissues analyzed whereas ATG3-Ab produced a signal of expected size in all tissues (data not shown), indicating that MTases starting at ATG1 and ATG2 are either not present in vivo or only at very low levels that are not detectable with this method. To test whether the MTase isoform detected with ATG3-Ab corresponds to a translational start at ATG3, we purified MTase from mouse ES cells and microsequenced its N terminus. TableI shows that the N-terminal sequence of MTase from ES cells matches the deduced protein sequence downstream of ATG3. These data clearly demonstrate that in ES cells, translation of the Dnmt1 mRNA starts at ATG3. Recently, a peptide mapping of MTase from MEL cells was described, which indicated a translation initiation at ATG3 (27Glickman J.F. Pavlovich J.G. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17851-17857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This means that totipotent ES cells and transformed MEL cells contain MTases with identical N termini starting at ATG3 (MTaseATG3) with an open reading frame of 1619 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 183,034 Da.Table IN-terminal sequencing of DNA MTase from mouse embryonic stem cellsATGAmino acid sequenceATG1MRTPFGATG2MVFPHSATG3MPARTAATG4MADSNRObserved—ARTACycle12345The amino acid sequence downstream of ATG1, ATG2, ATG3, and ATG4 is shown. Amino acids are denoted as one-letter symbols. The sequence obtained matches the sequence downstream of ATG3 during the first five cycles of the reaction (boldface). Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequence downstream of ATG1, ATG2, ATG3, and ATG4 is shown. Amino acids are denoted as one-letter symbols. The sequence obtained matches the sequence downstream of ATG3 during the first five cycles of the reaction (boldface). A protein smaller in size than the somatic form of MTase was detected in preimplantation embryos using a polyclonal MTase antibody and was suggested to be a MTase isoform (13Carlson L.L. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2536-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that this protein band reacted with ATG4-Ab but not with ATG2-Ab or ATG3-Ab (Fig. 2, right panels and data not shown). In addition, a polyclonal MTase C-terminal antibody also reacted with this protein band (Fig. 2, right panels). These results suggest that preimplantation embryos contain a shorter isoform of Dnmt1 starting at ATG4 (MTaseATG4) with an open reading frame of 1501 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 169,849 Da. We used a genetic approach to further analyze the origin of the longer and shorter isoforms and to investigate the usage of translation initiation site in the Dnmt1 gene. For these experiments, we chose Dnmt1 null ES cells, which do not express MTase and have a hypomethylated genome but can be rescued by transfection with aDnmt1 minigene (see pMT50, Fig. 1 A) (15Tucker K.L. Talbot D. Lee M.A. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We systematically mutagenized each of the four possible in-frame ATGs (ATG → TTG) of the Dnmt1 minigene construct and tested them in null ES cells. The wild-type Dnmt1 minigene restores expression of the longer isoform, which is naturally expressed in wild-type ES cells. Mutation of either ATG1, ATG2, or ATG4 did not affect the expression of the longer isoform, MTaseATG3 (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, mutation of ATG1,2 and ATG3 together or ATG3 alone resulted in the expression of the shorter MTase isoform. This protein was recognized by the ATG4-Ab but not the ATG2-Ab or ATG3-Ab (data not shown). It is unlikely that a start codon downstream of ATG4 was used because the next in-frame ATG and CTG are 266 and 97 amino acids downstream of ATG4 and would be expected to produce a noticeably shorter protein which would not be recognized by the ATG4-Ab. The ES cell clones shown in Fig. 3 A were selected for high MTase expression levels. However, when looking at a large number of ES cell clones, we observed that Dnmt1 protein levels generated from constructs carrying deletions of ATG1,2 or ATG4 (generating MTaseATG3) were on average comparable with those observed from the wild-type minigene, whereas protein levels obtained with deletion of ATG3 or ATG1,2 and ATG3 (generating MTaseATG4) were higher than with the wild-type minigene (data not shown). In summary, our data indicate that ATG3 is necessary and sufficient for expression of the longer MTase isoform in ES cells, whereas ATG1 and ATG2 seem not to be used in these cells. In addition, ATG4 is necessary for the expression of the shorter isoform. We demonstrated that two translational start sites are functional in ES cells; however, when both are present, ATG3 is dominant over ATG4 and only the longer isoform, MTaseATG3, is expressed. To assess the function of these two MTase isoforms in ES cells, we isolated genomic DNA from Dnmt1 null ES cells rescued with the wild-type minigene or with the minigene containing mutated ATG1,2 and ATG3. The DNA was digested with the methyl-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII, separated on agarose gel, blotted, and probed with a radioactive centromeric repeat DNA fragment. Fig. 3 Bshows that both the cells containing MTaseATG3 or MTaseATG4 were able to restore methylation near wild-type levels, indicating that both enzyme isoforms are functional in ES cells. Dnmt1 null ES cells die upon induction of differentiation and cannot form teratomas (15Tucker K.L. Talbot D. Lee M.A. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To test whether MTaseATG4 can rescue the differentiation capacity of these cells, we injected MTaseATG4-transfected ES cells in the flank of 129/sv male mice to generate teratomas. We found that the MTaseATG4-rescued ES cells produced teratomas (11/11) at the same efficiency as ES cells rescued with the wild-type minigene (6/6) or wild-type J1 ES cells (11/11). A control experiment using Dnmt1 null ES cells did not (0/5) generate any teratomas as shown previously. The teratomas were excised and tested for the presence of MTase by Western blot analysis. As expected, MTaseATG4teratomas contained only MTaseATG4, whereas the teratomas derived from ES cells rescued with the wild-type minigene or the teratomas derived from wild-type J1 ES cells contained only MTaseATG3 (Fig. 4 Aand data not shown). Histological analysis showed that both wild-type and MTaseATG4 teratomas contained endothelial cells, secretory endothelial cells, cartilage, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, and mature neural cells with no obvious differences. For example, glandular structures containing secretory endothelial cells are evident in stained sections of both wild-type J1 and MTaseATG4teratomas (Fig. 4 B). These results show that the short isoform found in preimplantation embryos can substitute for the longer isoform in differentiated, somatic tissue. It is interesting to notice that previous attempts to express MTaseATG4 with a heterologous promoter in ES cells failed (15Tucker K.L. Talbot D. Lee M.A. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that the MTase promoter of the minigene construct and correct transcriptional regulation is required for stable expression and cell viability. The goal of this study was to identify and characterize possible alternative translation products of the Dnmt1 gene. Sequencing of the 5′-end of the mouse Dnmt1 gene indicated the presence of four potential in-frame ATGs and suggested that different translational start sites could be used in vivo(Fig. 1 B). In addition to the somatic MTase form (about 190 kDa), an isoform with an apparent molecular mass of about 170 kDa has been observed in preimplantation embryos and was speculatively attributed to post-translational modification (13Carlson L.L. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2536-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have generated specific antibodies that can distinguish three different MTase forms and show that a shorter MTase form starting at ATG4 is expressed in preimplantation embryos (see Fig. 2). These results are consistent with an earlier observation that the expression of the open reading frame starting at ATG4 in COS cells also resulted in a protein of about 170 kDa (28Czank A. Hauselmann R. Page A.W. Leonhardt H. Bestor T.H. Schaffner W. Hergersberg M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With this set of antibodies, we could also show that the slower migrating MTase form found in ES cells and differentiated cells is most likely generated by translation starting at ATG3 (see Fig. 2). This conclusion was directly confirmed by protein sequencing of MTase purified from ES cells (see Table I). The same form (MTaseATG3) has been identified by peptide mapping in transformed MEL cells (27Glickman J.F. Pavlovich J.G. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17851-17857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We failed to detect any MTase in cell extracts from ES cells, kidney, brain, and thymus with ATG2-Ab, which recognize a peptide sequence between ATG2 and ATG3. These results suggest that ATG1 and ATG2 are not used in vivo, but we cannot rule out that these start sites are used at a lower rate or might play a role at other developmental stages. To directly test the role and function of these alternative MTase formsin vivo, we systematically mutagenized all four ATGs in aDnmt1 minigene construct and transfected MTase null ES cells. Even though ATG2, ATG3, and ATG4 fulfill the criteria of a good translation initiation site, only one of them, ATG3, is preferentially used in vivo. The shorter MTase form starting at ATG4 is only expressed in the absence of ATG3. These results fit well with the recent observation that, in oocytes, transcription starts at an alternative upstream promoter and generates a transcript lacking ATG1, ATG2, and ATG3 (14Mertineit C. Yoder J.A. Taketo T. Laird D.W. Trasler J.M. Bestor T.H. Development. 1998; 125: 889-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the shorter MTase form is present in growing oocytes and preimplantation embryos, a developmental stage when dramatic changes in the methylation pattern including imprinting occur (14Mertineit C. Yoder J.A. Taketo T. Laird D.W. Trasler J.M. Bestor T.H. Development. 1998; 125: 889-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Obata Y. Kaneko-Ishino T. Koide T. Takai Y. Ueda T. Domeki I. Shiroishi T. Ishino F. Kono T. Development. 1998; 125: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our genetic experiments, however, show that this shorter form has properties that are very similar if not identical to the longer, somatic MTase form. In null mutant ES cells as well as in teratomas, the shorter form can substitute for the longer form, MTaseATG3, and can cause remethylation and normal differentiation (see Figs. 3 and 4). It will be interesting to investigate whether the different isoforms of Dnmt1 have unique functions in establishing and maintaining methylation patterns during early development. We are currently generating mice which can express either MTaseATG3 or MTaseATG4 but not both. We thank S. Pradhan and R. C. Roberts for the MTase extracts and K. Hong and M. C.

To define this system, we examined the interaction of these eicosanoids with human PMNs. PMNs esterified 5-[3H]HETE to glycerolipids at 37 and 4 °C. At 37 but not 4 °C, the cells also hydroxylated the label to 5,20-[3H]diHETE. The acyl:CoA synthetase blocker, triacsin C, inhibited esterification but also led to an increase in the hydroxylation of the label. PMNs processed 5-[3H]oxoETE through the same pathways but only or principally after reducing it to 5-[3H]HETE (37 or 4 °C). In the presence of these varying metabolic reactions, PMNs (37 or 4 °C; ± triacsin C) could not be shown to receptor bind either radiolabel.Plasma membranes isolated from PMNs esterified but unlike whole cells did not reduce or hydroxylate 5-[3H]oxoETE. Triacsin C blocked esterification, thereby rendering the membranes unable to metabolize this radiolabel. Indeed, triacsin C-treated membranes bound (K d = 3.8 nm) 5-[3H]oxoETE specifically and reversibly to 86 pmol of sites per 25 μg of membrane protein. 5-OxoETE, 5-HETE, and 5,15-diHETE displaced this binding at concentrations correlating with their potency in eliciting PMN Ca2+ transients. GTP and GTPγS, but not ATP or ATPγS, also reduced 5-[3H]oxoETE binding, whereas 15-HETE, leukotriene B4, platelet-activating factor, IL-8, C5a, and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe lacked this effect. We conclude that PMNs and their plasma membranes use an acyl:CoA synthetase-dependent route to esterify 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE into lipids. Blockade of the synthetase uncovers cryptic plasmalemma sites that bind 5-oxoETE with exquisite specificity. These sites apparently mediate responses to the 5-oxo class of eicosanoids and are likely members of the serpentine superfamily of G protein-linked receptors. 5-Hydroxy- and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoate (5-HETE and 5-oxoETE) activate polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) through a common, receptor-like recognition system.

GTP and GTPγS, but not ATP or ATPγS, also reduced 5-[3H]oxoETE binding, whereas 15-HETE, leukotriene B4, platelet-activating factor, IL-8, C5a, and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe lacked this effect. We conclude that PMNs and their plasma membranes use an acyl:CoA synthetase-dependent route to esterify 5-HETE and 5-oxoETE into lipids. Blockade of the synthetase uncovers cryptic plasmalemma sites that bind 5-oxoETE with exquisite specificity. These sites apparently mediate responses to the 5-oxo class of eicosanoids and are likely members of the serpentine superfamily of G protein-linked receptors. 5(S)-hydroxy-(E,Z,Z,Z)-6,8,11,14-ETE eicosatetraenoic acid 5-oxo-(E,Z,Z,Z)-6,8,11,14-ETE 5(R,S)-hydroxy-(E,Z,Z,Z)-6,8,11,14-ETE 15-diHETE, 5(S),15(S)-dihydroxy-(E,Z,Z,E)-6,8,11,13-ETE 20-diHETE, 5(S),20-dihydroxy-(E,Z,Z,Z)-6,8,11,14-ETE 15(S)-hydroxy-(Z,Z,Z,E)-5,8,11,13-ETE 5-oxo-15(S)-hydro-xy-(E,Z,Z,E)-6,8,11,13-ETE leukotriene B4 platelet-activating factor N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe polymorphonuclear neutrophil high pressure liquid chromatography bovine serum albumin interleukin. Cells respond to stimulation by converting storage arachidonic acid into products that signal their own or nearby cell responses (1Borgeat P. Nadeau M. Salari H. Poubelle P. Fruteau d.L. Adv.

Many such eicosanoids act by binding to receptors (3Halushka P.V. Mais D.E. Mayeux P.R. Morinelli T.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Others have a less clear mechanism of action. 5-HETE1 and LTB4, for example, are companion metabolites formed by the attack of 5-lipoxygenase on arachidonic acid in, e.g. human PMNs (1Borgeat P.

Although the two eicosanoids have similar stimulatory actions, 5-HETE has little affinity for LTB4 receptors and is resistant to a LTB4 receptor antagonist. In down-regulation assays, furthermore, 5-HETE desensitizes to itself but does not cross-desensitize with other chemotactic factors (LTB4, FMLP, C5a, PAF, or IL-8) or eicosanoids (lipoxins A4 and B4 and prostaglandins D2 and E2) (7O'Flaherty J.T.

The data imply that 5-HETE acts through a unique recognition system. However, evidence relating this system to receptor-like binding sites has proven difficult to obtain.

The reaction occurs in PMNs or their isolated plasma membranes at 4 or 37 °C and results in the acylation of 5-[3H]HETE to membrane glycerolipids: PMNs and plasmalemma accumulate 5-HETE almost exclusively in esterified form without evidence of receptor binding (10Powell W.S.

Because esterification is a ubiquitous means for processing fatty acids, other cell types are apt also to esterify 5-HETE and thereby obscure the receptor binding of the compound. Despite this difficulty, however, putative receptors for 5-HETE merit study. PMNs, eosinophils, and monocytes dehydrogenate 5-HETE to 5-oxoETE (6Powell W.S. Zhang Y. Gravel S.

Before use, 5-[3H]HETE and [3H]LTB4 (∼250 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) were purified on reversed-phase HPLC (0.8 × 30 cm μ-Bondapak column; methanol:water:acetate, 750:250:0.1, v/v; 1 ml/min (24Richards C.F.

To make 5-[3H]oxoETE, 5-[3H]HETE (600 pmol) was treated with 5 μmol of dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone in dry ethyl ether (25 μl) for 5 min at 20 °C. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of isopropanol, reduced to 10 μl under a stream of N2, diluted with 0.5 ml of water, made pH 3 with HCl, and exhaustively extracted into hexane. Pooled extracts were evaporated to 5 μl, dissolved in 30 μl of isopropanol, and purified by normal-phase HPLC (0.8 × 30 cm μ-Porasil column, hexane:isopropanol:acetic acid, 984:16:1, v/v; 1 ml/min). 5-[3H]OxoETE and 5-[3H]HETE eluted at 8.5 and 30 min, respectively. Label eluting at ∼8.5 min was further purified on the reversed-phase HPLC system described above. We stress that our synthesis used reagent amounts and conditions that favor formation of the natural, as opposed to the 8–9-trans,isomer of 5-oxoETE. Almost exclusive production of natural 5-[3H]oxoETE was confirmed based on its elution at 30 min on reversed-phase HPLC (8–9-trans-5-[3H]oxoETE eluted at 32 min (9O'Flaherty J.T. Cordes J.F. Lee S.L.

The final product (30% recovery; 99% radiological purity) migrated with authentic 5-oxoETE on reversed- and normal-phase HPLC as well as TLC systems I and II (see below). The label was stored in elution solvent at 5 × 106 dpm/ml under argon at 4 °C. Stored in this way, it retained radiological purity for at least 12 weeks. Just before use, 5-[3H]HETE and 5-[3H]oxoETE were reduced to 10–30 μl volumes under a N2 stream, diluted in Hanks' buffer containing 2.5 mg/ml BSA, and added to reactions so that the final solvent and BSA levels were <0.1% and 250 μg/ml, respectively. Control studies treated PMNs with an equivalent amount of solvent and BSA. PMNs were isolated from normal donor blood (7O'Flaherty J.T. Jacobson D. Redman J. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4323-4328PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ transients were done on fura2-AM-loaded PMNs suspended in Hanks' buffer (+Ca2+, no MgCl2) (7O'Flaherty J.T. Jacobson D. Redman J. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4323-4328PubMed Google Scholar). Binding was done on PMNs (107) suspended in 1 ml of Hanks' buffer (37 °C) and treated with triacsin C or Me2SO for 30 min. Suspensions were placed on ice for 30 min, incubated (4 °C) with label for 0–120 min, layered on 0.4 ml of silicone oil, and centrifuged (12,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C). Isolated supernatant fluids and pellets were counted for radioactivity (32O'Flaherty J.T. Redman J.F. Jacobson D.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Results are given as the percentage of total recovered radioactivity in pellets. For membrane binding assays, plasma membranes (see below) were incubated (37 °C) with radiolabel in 250 μl of Hanks' buffer and passed through GF/C filters. Filters were washed with 5 ml of Hanks' buffer (no CaCl2 or MgCl2; 4 °C), air-dried, and counted for radioactivity (32O'Flaherty J.T. Redman J.F. Jacobson D.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PMNs (107 in 1 ml of Hanks' buffer) were incubated at 37 °C with triacsin C or Me2SO and placed on ice for 30 min (for 4 °C experiments) or used directly (for 37 °C experiments). Suspensions were incubated (4 or 37 °C, respectively) with a radiolabel for 2.5–120 min and centrifuged (12,000 × g for 5 s at 4 °C). Cell pellets were twice washed with 1 ml of Hanks' buffer (4 °C; no CaCl2 or MgCl2) and then suspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. For plasmalemmal studies, plasma membranes were isolated from PMNs (see below), suspended in Hanks' buffer (37 °C), treated with triacsin C or Me2SO for 30 min, and incubated (37 °C) with label. Final washed PMN suspensions, pools of the supernatant, and washes of the original cell suspensions and membrane suspensions were twice extracted with an equal volume of chloroform:methanol, 2:1, v/v, containing enough HCl to make the final mixture pH 3–4. Pooled extracts were evaporated to dryness, taken up in 40 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), and applied to heat-activated (180 °C, 3 h) Silica Gel G TLC plates (Analtech, Newark, DE). Plates were developed to 15 cm in TLC system I (ethyl ether:hexane:acetic acid, 60:40:1, v/v) or II (ethyl ether:hexane:NH3(OH), 60:40:1, v/v) and scraped in 0.5-cm zones. Scrapings were suspended in 200 μl of methanol for 10 min and counted for radioactivity (18O'Flaherty J.T. Kuroki M. Nixon A.B. Wijkander J. Yee E. Lee S.L. Smitherman P.K. Wykle R.L. Daniel L.W. J.

In selected experiments, extracts were evaporated to dryness and suspended in 500 μl of Tris (1m) buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 ng of 5-oxoETE, 500 ng of rac 5-HETE, and 5 μg of triglyceride. Reactions were incubated (20 °C) with BSA or triglyceride lipase (Calbiochem, 50,000 units/mg, or Sigma, 60,000 units/mg) for 20 min and then extracted and examined by TLC. In other analyses, extracts of supernatant fluids were dried, taken up in 30 μl of methanol or isopropanol, and analyzed by reversed-phase or normal-phase HPLC, respectively. 2–4 × 108 PMNs in 5 ml of normal saline were treated with 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times, taken up in 8 ml of relaxation buffer, subjected to N2-cavitation, and treated with 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cavitates were freed of whole cells and nuclei by centrifugation and resolved on Percoll gradients (32O'Flaherty J.T. Redman J.F. Jacobson D.P. J. Cell.

Membranes were diluted with an equal volume of Hanks' buffer (no CaCl2 or MgCl2); centrifuged (150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C), suspended in Hanks' buffer (1.4 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2), and used immediately. PMN suspensions were treated with Me2SO or the acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor triacsin C (33Korchak H.M. Kane L.H. Rossi M.W. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30281-30287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 30 min, equilibrated to 4 °C or kept at 37 °C, incubated with 100 fmol/ml of 5-[3H]HETE, separated into cells and media, and analyzed by TLC. PMNs progressively incorporated the label to equilibrium levels over 40 min at 37 °C or 60 min at 4 °C. After 80 min at 37 °C, Me2SO-treated PMNs had taken up >90% of the label. On TLC system I, cellular radioactivity migrated with triglyceride and to a small extent phospholipid (Fig. 1, top left panel), whereas medium radioactivity moved with 5,20-diHETE (Fig. 1, bottom left panel). In studies at 4 °C, in contrast, PMNs took up only ∼25% of label, and most of this migrated with triglyceride. Media label migrated with 5-HETE (Fig. 2,left panels). The pattern of these results was not limited to 80-min incubations. Analyses of suspensions incubated (37 or 4 °C) with label for 5, 10, 20, 40, or 60 min, as well as 80 min, by TLC, HPLC, and other systems revealed that PMNs contained glycerolipid-associated but virtually no intact 5-[3H]HETE (21O'Flaherty J.T. Wykle R.L. Redman J. Samuel M. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3277-3283PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of triacsin C with the expectation that this drug would block the charging of 5-HETE with CoA and thereby reduce its esterification while increasing its accumulation as intact, receptor-bound ligand. Triacsin C (≥ 1 μm) did in fact reduce esterification. PMNs treated with a 20 μm concentration of the drug had only a small amount of triglyceride-associated radioactivity during an 80-min incubation with 5-[3H]HETE at 37 or 4 °C (Figs. 1 and 2,top right panels). In 37 °C experiments, cells contained no detectable intact 5-[3H]HETE (Fig. 1, top right panel) while media contained radioactivity migrating with 5,20-diHETE and to a lesser extent 5-HETE in TLC system I (Fig. 1,bottom right panel), TLC system II (not shown), and HPLC (Fig. 3, top panel). In 4 °C experiments, cells had small amounts (<3%), and media had far larger amounts (>70%), of radioactivity that moved with 5-HETE in TLC system I (Fig. 2, bottom right panel), TLC system II (data not shown), and reversed-phase HPLC (data not shown). Analysis of triacsin C-treated PMNs exposed to 5-[3H]HETE (4 or 37 °C) for 20 min gave results paralleling those shown in Figs. 1and 2. In particular, these PMNs never amassed more than 3% of total radioactivity as intact 5-[3H]HETE. We conclude that triacsin C blocks the esterification of 5-HETE into glycerolipids. It also leads to an increase in the oxidation of the fatty acid at 37 °C and promotes accumulation of intact 5-[3H]HETE with cells at 4 °C.Figure 2Effect of triacsin C on the metabolism of 5-HETE at 4 °C. PMN suspensions were treated with Me2SO (left panels) or 20 μmtriacsin C (right panels) for 30 min, placed on ice for 30 min, incubated with 100 pmol of 5-[3H]HETE at 4 °C for 80 min, and separated into pellet (top panels) and supernatant (bottom panels) fractions.

PMNs were treated with 100 μm triacsin C, incubated with the indicated label at 37 °C for 80 min, and processed as in Fig. 1. Extracts of supernatants were analyzed on reversed-phase HPLC and collected in 250-μl fractions. Results are percentages of recovered radioactivity per 250 μl of eluent and are typical of experiments on two donor cells. The numbered areas give the elution of 5,20-diHETE (1), 5-HETE (2), and 5-oxoETE (3).

More particularly, cell label migrated with glycerolipids, media label migrated with 5,20-diHETE, and triacsin C reduced glycerolipid-co-migrating and increased 5,20-diHETE-co-migrating radioactivity (Figs. 4 and 5). However, the media from these incubations also had radioactivity that migrated with 5-HETE in TLC system I (Figs. 4 and 5, bottom panels), TLC system II (data not shown), reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 3, bottom panel), and normal-phase HPLC (data not shown). Hence, PMNs readily reduce 5-[3H]oxoETE and might process the latter metabolite further. We accordingly examined the radioactivity migrating with lipids and 5,20-diHETE in greater detail. Cell extracts were digested with triglyceride lipase. The label recovered from these digests migrated with 5-HETE rather than 5-oxoETE on TLC (Fig. 6) and reversed-phase HPLC (not shown). Similarly, label in the media from these suspensions eluted on reversed-phase HPLC not only with 5-HETE but also with 5,20-diHETE (Fig. 3, bottom panel).

Our previous results have shown that LMW-PTP is able to specifically bind and dephosphorylate activated PDGF receptor, thus modulating PDGF-induced mitogenesis. In particular LMW-PTP is involved in pathways that regulate the transcription of the immediately early genesmyc and fos in response to growth factor stimulation. In this study we have established that, in nontransformed NIH3T3 cells, LMW-PTP exists constitutively in cytosolic and cytoskeleton-associated localization and that, after PDGF stimulation, c-Src is able to bind and to phosphorylate LMW-PTP only in the cytoskeleton-associated fraction. As a consequence of its tyrosine phosphorylation, LMW-PTP significantly increases its catalytic activity. After PDGF stimulation these two LMW-PTP pools act on distinct substrates, contributing in different manners to the PDGF receptor signaling.

On the other hand we have now demonstrated that the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP acts specifically on a few not yet identified proteins that become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to the PDGF receptor activation. Finally, these two LMW-PTP pools markedly differ in the timing of the processes in which they are involved.

Signal transduction cascades driven by tyrosine phosphorylation regulate many cellular processes in eukaryotes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (1Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The extent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is determined by the concerted activity of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs).1 In recent years the importance of PTPs in the regulation of intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation level has been widely recognized. The PTPs superfamily consists of over 70 enzymes that, despite very limited sequence similarity, have a common active site motif CX 5R and an identical catalytic mechanism. On the basis of their function, structure, and sequence, PTPs are often classified in four main families: 1) tyrosine-specific phosphatases, 2) VH1-like dual specificity PTPs, 3) the Cdc25, and 4) the low molecular weight phosphatase (3Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is an 18-kDa enzyme that is expressed in a wide variety of mammalian tissues (4Ramponi G. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1994; 8: 1-25Google Scholar). In our previous studies on the physiologic functions of LMW-PTP, we have expressed in NIH3T3 cells a catalytically inactive Cys12 to Ser LMW-PTP mutant, which has maintained its capacity of substrate binding (5Chiarugi P. Marzocchini R. Raugei G. Pazzagli C. Berti A. Camici G. Manao G. Cappugi G. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this LMW-PTP mutant form caused enhanced cell proliferation and serum-induced mitogenesis, indicating that the C12S mutant is a dominant negative LMW-PTP (dnLMW-PTP) (7Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Analysis of dnLMW-PTP overexpressing clones led to the identification of PDGF-R as a specific in vivosubstrate of LMW-PTP and to the demonstration that this phosphatase is most probably involved in the control of one or more signaling pathways triggered by PDGF-R activation (8Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The action of LMW-PTP is essentially restricted to G1 phase of the cell cycle and influences myc and fos gene induction driven by PDGF-R activation. In particular, LMW-PTP appears to be involved in the regulation of myc expression interfering with Src pathway and in the regulation of fos activation through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase-independent pathway mediated by the STAT proteins (8Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Previous results (9Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that LMW-PTP is tyrosine-phosphorylated in unstimulated v-Src overexpressing cells, although no direct association was detected between v-Src and LMW-PTP. More recently, it has been reported that in resting Jurkat cells LMW-PTP is tyrosine-phosphorylated, apparently by Lck kinase, and rapidly dephosphorylated upon T cell receptor stimulation (10Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The same paper reported that LMW-PTP phosphorylation occurs in Tyr131 and partially in Tyr132, leading to a 2-fold enhancement of LMW-PTP enzymatic activity. Src tyrosine kinase associates with activated PDGF receptor, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, slightly increases its catalytic activity, and translocates to the cell periphery by an actin-dependent process (11Fincham V.J. Unlu M. Brunton V.G. Pitts J.D. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1551-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Here Src becomes associated with pp125FAK, and this fact represents an early and critical event in the assembly of focal adhesion complex (12Schaller M.D. Hilldebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Src/FAK association enhances Src activity, and this is a prerequisite for tyrosine phosphorylation of other focal adhesion or cytoskeleton-associated proteins (13Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These considerations led us to examine the role of the LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation in relation to its subcellular targeting upon PDGF-induced mitogenesis in NIH3T3 cells. We find that in NIH3T3 cells LMW-PTP is localized in both cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton-associated fractions also in the absence of PDGF treatment. These two different LMW-PTP pools are differentially regulated, since only the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP fraction is specifically phosphorylated by c-Src after PDGF stimulation. As a consequence of this phosphorylation, LMW-PTP greatly increases its catalytic activity probably toward cytoskeleton-associated Tyr-phosphorylated substrate(s). Furthermore we show that these two intracellular LMW-PTP pools exert their actions at different times starting from PDGF-R stimulation. Altogether these data are consistent with the hypothesis that LMW-PTP is subjected to different regulatory mechanisms and has different substrate specificity in consequence of its subcellular localization.

NIH3T3 cells were purchased from ATCC; human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was from Peprotech; enhanced chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Src kinase assay kit and anti-Src antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; anti-PDGF receptor antibodies and PY20 and PY99 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Santa Cruz. NIH3T3 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. 10 μg of pSVT7PTPC12S (7Chiarugi P. Cirri P.

Stable transfected clonal cell lines were isolated by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Control cell lines were obtained by transfecting 2 μg of pSV2neo alone. The clonal lines were screened for expression of the transfected genes by (a) Northern blot analysis and (b) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polyclonal anti-LMW-PTP rabbit antibodies, which do not cross-react with murine endogenous LMW-PTP. 10 μg of pSGT vector-base constructs overexpressing dominant negative c-Src (SrcK−) (kindly provided by Dr. S. Courtneidge) and 0.5 μg of pBABEpuro, conferring puromycin resistance were cotransfected in NIH3T3 cells or in wtLMW-PTP overexpressing cells, using the calcium phosphate method. Stable transfected clonal cell lines were isolated by selection with puromycin (1 mg/liter). The clonal lines were screened for expression of the transfected genes by anti-p60 Src monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz). 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before receiving 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Freshly made pervanadate solution (50 mm sodium vanadate and 50 mm H2O2) was added to the cells at a final concentration of 0.1 mm 30 min before the cells were lysed. Cells were then lysed for 20 min on ice in 500 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Complete RIPA lysis buffer (cRIPA) is RIPA plus 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of the specific antibodies. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Sartorius). Immunoblots were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% Tween 20, for 1 h at room temperature, probed first with specific antibodies and then with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, washed, and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PDGF-stimulated NIH3T3 were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of RIPA and then resuspended in cRIPA buffer by shaking for 1 h at room temperature and newly clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. RIPA or cRIPA fractions were then used for immunoprecipitation analysis. Subcellular localization of many enzymes, such as protein kinase C, Raf, Src, etc., is influenced by extracellular stimuli, and detergent phase partitioning is a commonly used separation method (15Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RIPA buffer is a commonly used lysis buffer containing non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40. It is currently accepted that the RIPA-soluble fraction contains cytosolic and many of the plasma membrane structures. Caveolae, focal adhesions, and cytoskeleton-associated structures need additional detergents to be lysed. Caveolae are solubilized by octyl glucoside treatment, while cytoskeleton-associated structures are solubilized using stronger ionic detergent such as deoxycholate or SDS (16Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Hollenbeck P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that LMW-PTP is an enzyme that upon PDGF stimulation interacts with the activated PDGF receptor (7Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To assess if LMW-PTP action is restricted to cytosolic soluble fraction or not, we have evaluated the relative amount LMW-PTP in RIPA and cRIPA fractions after PDGF stimulation. Serum-starved NIH3T3 cells overexpressing LMW-PTP were stimulated with 30 ng/ml of PDGF for 5 min, and the lysates were fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both RIPA and cRIPA-soluble fractions were used in immunoprecipitation assays with anti-LMW-PTP antibodies. Anti-LMW-PTP Western blot (Fig. 1 A) reveals that LMW-PTP resides in both fractions and that its relative amount is not dependent on growth factor administration. We reported previously that PDGF-R-associated LMW-PTP is not tyrosine-phosphorylated, neither in the resting state nor during activation of the receptor transduction pathway (7Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the LMW-PTP in the RIPA-soluble fraction did not become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF stimulation (Fig. 1 B, left). Surprisingly, we found that in the same conditions the LMW-PTP associated to the cRIPA fraction becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon PDGF stimulation as indicated by reprobing the same Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1 B, right). We demonstrated previously that LMW-PTP associates with the activated PDGF-R. This interaction leads to PDGF-R dephosphorylation and modulates specifically the Src and the STAT pathways of the mitogenic signaling (8Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 A we report the analysis of the association between PDGF-R and LMW-PTP after subcellular fractionation with RIPA and cRIPA. In this experiment we have used NIH3T3 overexpressing dnLMW-PTP to maximize the interaction between the PDGF-R and the phosphatase, which occurs via the LMW-PTP catalytic site (7Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were PDGF-stimulated for 5 min. Lysates were then fractionated as indicated above and used in anti-LMW-PTP immunoprecipitation. The anti-PDGF-R immunoblot (Fig. 2 A) reveals that PDGF-R coimmunoprecipitates with LMW-PTP only in the RIPA fraction, while it does not in the cRIPA fraction. The same samples were then checked for LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). Results clearly indicate that the interaction of LMW-PTP with the activated PDGF-R is not accompanied by LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation, since this phenomenon is restricted to the cRIPA cytoskeleton-associated fraction. According to the results of the previous sections, the RIPA and cRIPA-soluble pools of LMW-PTP are spatially separated within the cell and hence could exert different functions in cell physiology. We have examined the time courses of both PDGF-R/LMW-PTP association and the LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation. NIH3T3 cells overexpressing dnLMW-PTP were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml of PDGF for 5, 10, or 20 min. For the association analysis cells were lysed using RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGF-R antibodies. The anti-LMW-PTP immunoblot (Fig. 3 A) shows that the association between the two molecules is transient, reaching a maximum 5 min after PDGF treatment and then rapidly decreasing. In the phosphorylation analysis cells were lysed in cRIPA buffer, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-LMW-PTP antibodies. The anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot, presented in Fig. 3 B, shows that LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation is a long lasting phenomenon, since it reaches a maximum about 10 min after PDGF stimulation and then slowly decreases. Previous reports showed that LMW-PTP is phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells overexpressing v-Src and in resting Jurkat T-cells (9Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To study the role of c-Src tyrosine kinase in LMW-PTP phosphorylation during PDGF signal transduction, we decided to use cells overexpressing both the dominant negative form of c-Src (SrcK−) and the wtLMW-PTP. After PDGF stimulation, we have evaluated the LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation level in SrcK− /wtLMW-PTP overexpressing cells compared with control cells overexpressing wtLMW-PTP alone. To increase the tyrosine phosphorylation level of LMW-PTP, both cell lines were pretreated with 1 mm pervanadate for 30 min before PDGF stimulation to inhibit phosphotyrosine phosphatases activity. Pervanadate is a specific and strong inhibitor of PTPs whose action leads to general increase of tyrosine phosphorylation level of many intracellular proteins (18Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fisher E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with cRIPA and immunoprecipitated with anti-LMW-PTP antibodies. Results of the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot are shown in Fig. 4 A. After PDGF stimulation, in SrcK−/wtLMW-PTP overexpressing cells we observe a lower LMW-PTP phosphorylation level with respect to cells overexpressing wtLMW-PTP alone, both in pervanadate-treated and untreated cells. In Fig. 4 B we report, as control, the LMW-PTP content in the same sample. In a recent work we reported that SrcK− expression does not affect PDGF-R functionality as indicated by the fact that, in these cells, the level of phosphorylation of PDGF-R is equal with respect to not transfected cells (19Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). SrcK−/wtLMW-PTP overexpressing cells contain a fully active PDGF-R while possessing a defective Src kinase activity. Hence, these data indicate a specific role of Src tyrosine kinase and not of PDGF-R in LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation during PDGF stimulation. To assess whether LMW-PTP phosphorylation is performed by c-Src itself or by a Src-dependent tyrosine kinase, we decided to investigate the possible association between LMW-PTP and Src by means of coimmunoprecipitation analysis both in RIPA and cRIPA fractions. wtLMW-PTP and SrcK−/wtLMW-PTP overexpressing cells were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with PDGF for 5 min. Fig. 5 A shows the anti-LMW-PTP immunoblot of the anti-Src immunoprecipitation of the fractionated lysates. Our results indicate that there is an association between LMW-PTP and c-Src both in SrcK−/wtLMW-PTP and wtLMW-PTP overexpressing cells, after PDGF stimulation. The LMW-PTP/c-Src association is restricted to the cRIPA fraction in agreement with our previous observation about the lack of interaction between LMW-PTP and c-Src in the cytosolic fraction during PDGF stimulation (8Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A similar experiment was performed pretreating SrcK−/wtLMW-PTP cells with pervanadate. The results shown in Fig. 5 B indicate that LMW-PTP/Src interaction is independent from pervanadate administration, thus suggesting that the association between the two molecules is not mediated by LMW-PTP catalytic site. Activated PDGF-R is a substrate of LMW-PTP only in the RIPA fraction, since there is not association between these two proteins in the cRIPA fraction (Fig. 2). To find possible substrate(s) of LMW-PTP in the cRIPA fraction, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the cytoskeleton-associated proteins upon PDGF stimulation. Analysis of cRIPA lysates was performed by means of anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) immunoblot in cells overexpressing wtLMW-PTP, dnLMW-PTP, and mock-transfected cells. This experiment (shown in Fig. 6) led us to the identification of a major differentially tyrosine-phosphorylated band with an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kDa and two minor bands of about 43 and 39 kDa. These proteins could represent possible LMW-PTP substrates in the cRIPA fraction. Since in PDGF-stimulated cells the principal tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the 180–220 kDa range is PDGF-R itself, we reprobed the filter with anti-PDGF-R antibodies with negative results. Nevertheless these data suggest that LMW-PTP may have different substrates in distinct subcellular localization. Our previous studies pointed out the role of LMW-PTP in the PDGF-induced mitogenesis. We have shown that LMW-PTP is a key intermediate in the early steps of PDGF-R signal transduction, because it binds directly to activated receptor and consequently modulates the activation of Src tyrosine kinase and the phosphorylation state of STAT proteins. We have also underlined that LMW-PTP action on PDGF signal transduction is specific, since this enzyme influences only these two signaling pathways. In fact, recent data from our laboratory have shown that in PDGF-stimulated NIH3T3 cells, c-Src overexpression leads to an up-regulation of both STAT1 and STAT3, hence the effect of LMW-PTP on STAT pathway could be a consequence of the concomitant action of LMW-PTP on Src activity (19Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of LMW-PTP with the Src and the STATs pathways modulates myc and fos expression, two protooncogenes crucial for G1 progression (8Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study we have identified, by means of subcellular fractionation, two different and constitutive LMW-PTP pools. The first one, that we called RIPA soluble, contains the cytoplasm and many of the plasma membrane structures. The second, the cRIPA-soluble fraction, contains cytoskeleton- and plasma membrane-associated structures such as caveolae, focal adhesion plaques, etc. We have established that the LMW-PTP associated with cRIPA fraction is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon PDGF stimulation, while cytosolic LMW-PTP is not (Fig. 1). The RIPA-soluble LMW-PTP pool is the only one that interacts with the activated PDGF-R, as indicated by our data in coimmunoprecipitation assay in RIPA and cRIPA fractions (Fig. 2). In addition, no tyrosine phosphorylation is observed in PDGF-R-bound LMW-PTP, thus suggesting that LMW-PTP phosphorylation is not performed by PDGF-R. In agreement with our previously reported results (7Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), these data suggest that another tyrosine kinase must be implicated in this process. We have now shown that LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation is performed by Src tyrosine kinase on the basis of two evidences. First, in cells overexpressing SrcK−, the dominant negative form of c-Src, which is catalytically inactive but still able to bind its substrates, we observed a dramatic reduction of LMW-PTP phosphorylation in response to PDGF with respect to control cells (Fig. 4). Second, c-Src directly interacts with LMW-PTP, as indicated by LMW-PTP/c-Src coimmunoprecipitation assays. Interestingly, this association is restricted to the cytoskeletal-associated LMW-PTP, and it is not present in the RIPA fraction, according to the observation that LMW-PTP is phosphorylated only in the cytoskeleton-associated fraction (Fig. 5). On the other hand, we demonstrated previously that the functionality of PDGF-R is not impaired in SrcK−overexpressing cells, as indicated by tyrosine phosphorylation level of PDGF-R in SrcK− cells in comparison with NIH3T3 control cells (19Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations suggest that the difference in LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation be mainly due to c-Src kinase activity. In addition, the association between these two molecules is independent of pervanadate, a potent competitive inhibitor of PTPs. These data support the hypothesis that the interaction between LMW-PTP and c-Src is not mediated by LMW-PTP catalytic site. On the contrary, we reported previously that in the case of the activated PDGF-R/LMW-PTP interaction in the RIPA fraction, the presence of the competitive inhibitor orthovanadate completely inhibits this association (20Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Manao G. Taddei L. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The c-Src protooncoprotein has been recognized to reside in both cellular adhesion plaques and within the plasma membrane during growth factor stimulation (21Courtneidge S.A. Levinson A., D. Bishop J., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3783-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), although its cognate oncogenic counterpart v-Src has been found almost exclusively in adhesion plaques in transformed cells (11Fincham V.J. Unlu M. Brunton V.G. Pitts J.D. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1551-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Rohrschneider J.R. Cell. 1979; 16: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This fact accounts for the previously reported v-Src-directed LMW-PTP phosphorylation (9Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation is a phenomenon not restricted to transformed cells, but occurs also in normal cells in response to PDGF stimulation. Src tyrosine kinase has many different targets; one of them, the FAK tyrosine kinase, is active in focal adhesions. Activation of cell surface integrins and growth factor receptors lead to a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and of focal adhesion-associated proteins such as paxillin and tensin (23Petch L.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a bipartite kinase between FAK and c-Src is an early and critical event in the formation of focal adhesion complexes during the activation of growth factors and integrins signaling pathways. Recent evidence indicated that the association of Src and FAK enhances Src activity, and this is a prerequisite for cytoskeleton-associated Src activation leading to the phosphorylation of proteins in focal adhesion plaques (13Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Most likely, LMW-PTP is among these newly phosphorylated proteins. We have evidence that the phosphorylation of LMW-PTP performed in vitro by c-Src leads to an increase of about 25-fold in the LMW-PTP enzymatic activity. 2P. Cirri, P. Chiarugi, L. Taddei, G. Raugei, G. Camici, G. Manao, and G. Ramponi, submitted for publication. Hence, after PDGF stimulation the two constitutive LMW-PTP pools possess very marked differences in enzymatic activity that could reflect distinct roles in signal transmission. Furthermore, we analyzed the duration of the two phenomena in which LMW-PTP is involved. LMW-PTP interaction with PDGF-R, restricted to the RIPA fraction, is transient and reaches a maximum 5 min after PDGF stimulation, while LMW-PTP phosphorylation in cytoskeleton-associated fraction is a long lasting phenomenon and decreases only after 40 min (Fig. 3). These temporal and spatial differences between the two LMW-PTP pools may reflect distinct substrate specificity and different roles or of the two LMW-PTP pools in different subcellular localization. Finally, we have looked for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that could represent new LMW-PTP substrate in the cytoskeleton-associated fraction. Our results with wtLMW-PTP or dnLMW-PTP overexpressing cells in cRIPA fraction show mainly a protein of about 200 kDa, which is differentially phosphorylated in these cell lines (Fig. 6). We have found that this p200 is not PDGF-R, but we were not able to identify this protein that should be a cytoskeleton-associated substrate of LMW-PTP. Among proteins that: 1) have a molecular mass of about 200 kDa, 2) reside in the cytoskeleton fraction, and 3) become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF, tensin, talin, p190GAP, and a yet unidentified p200 (24Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) are possible candidates to be a LMW-PTP substrate in the cRIPA fraction. In conclusion, the role of LMW-PTP during the transduction of the PDGF mitogenic signaling appears more complex than the bare regulation of PDGF-R phosphorylation. LMW-PTP is constitutively distributed in distinct intracellular localization, most probably with different physiological implications. The cytosolic LMW-PTP fraction is recruited to the activated PDGF-R, which is a LMW-PTP-specific substrate. This is a short lasting event that does not lead to LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation. On the other side, again in response to PDGF stimulation, the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP pool becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src. This event is instead a long lasting phenomenon, which leads to an increase in LMW-PTP catalytic activity and could be responsible for the dephosphorylation of cytoskeleton-associated proteins such as p200. In conclusion, the two LMW-PTP pools, having distinct subcellular localization and showing different responses to PDGF stimulation, may play diverse roles in cell physiology."

GroEL is a tetradecamer composed of two heptameric rings, which enclose a cavity where folding takes place through multiple cycles of substrate and GroES binding and release. GroEL and GroES are also heat-shock proteins, their synthesis being increased during heat-shock conditions to help the cell coping with the thermal stress. Our results suggest that, as the temperature increases, GroEL decreases its protein folding activity and starts acting as a “protein store.” The molecular basis of this behavior is the loss of inter-ring signaling, which slows down GroES liberation from GroEL and therefore the release of the unfolded protein from the GroEL cavity. This behavior is reversible, and after heat-shock, GroEL reverts to its normal function. This might have a physiological meaning, since under thermal stress conditions, it may be inefficient for the cell to fold thermounstable proteins that are prone to denaturation.

Chaperonins are a large family of proteins found in all types of organisms and have a very important role in protein folding (1Ellis R.J. The Chaperonins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar), with GroEL from Escherichia coli and its cochaperonin GroES being the best characterized members of this family. The atomic structure of GroEL (2Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and GroES (3Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierash L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) are known and also that of the GroEL-GroES complex formed in the presence of ADP (4Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). GroEL consists of a double toroid, each one composed of seven subunits of a 58-kDa protein. The toroid encloses a cavity where folding takes place (5Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L.

Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The GroEL monomer can be separated in three well defined regions (2Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar): an equatorial domain, which holds all the inter-ring interactions and most of the intra-ring interactions, and contains the ATP binding sites; an apical domain, which contains all the residues involved in substrate and GroES binding; and an intermediate domain, which connects the apical and equatorial domains and acts as a hinge for the movements of the apical domain in response to signals generated in the equatorial domain. Upon ATP binding, GroES can bind to one or both GroEL rings, forming what has been called, respectively, an asymmetric or a symmetric complex (7Langer T. Pfeifer J. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 8Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M.

Although very complex, the GroEL mechanism is beginning to be understood. Binding of ATP to the equatorial domain induces an upward and outward movement of the apical domain that is increased upon GroES binding (4Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 11Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.

Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic regions of the unfolded protein interact with a large patch of hydrophobic residues placed in the apical domain, at the entrance of the cavity (13Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The binding of GroES to the same hydrophobic region of GroEL caps the ring and displaces the substrate to the interior of the now much enlarged cavity where, free of any undesired interaction, it may reach its native structure (5Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 6Mayhew M. Da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Upon GroES release, the enclosed substrate is also liberated, a fraction of which actually folds in each reaction cycle, so that several cycles of substrate and GroES binding to, and release from, GroEL are required (14Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). ATP is not directly involved in protein folding, but its binding and subsequent hydrolysis induce a functional and structural asymmetry between the two rings that is necessary for the cycling mechanism of GroEL to work. The asymmetry is based in a complex behavior of positive cooperativity of ATP binding among the subunits of the same ring and negative cooperativity with respect to the subunits of the adjacent ring (15Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). ATP binding would make possible the binding of a GroES oligomer and the liberation of the non-native polypeptide in the interior of the cavity as explained above. Only after ATP hydrolysis in the first ring would ATP be able to bind to the second ring, which would subsequently induce the liberation of GroES and the polypeptide from the first ring (16Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xy Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, a single-ring mutant is able to bind GroES but unable to release it, due to the lack of signal coming from the adjacent ring (5Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether a GroES oligomer binds to the second ring before the GroES bound to the first ring is released, although symmetrical complexes are observed in the same in vitro conditions (17Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the appearance of these complexes is related to an increase in folding efficiency (18Azem A. Diamant S. Kessel M. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12021-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 68-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). What seems to be well established, however is that, although the functional unit in protein folding is each one of the two rings (5Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), the double-ring structure and the signaling between the two rings are stringent for the folding mechanism to work (16Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xy Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).Besides assisting in the folding of proteins under normal conditions, GroEL and its cochaperonin GroES are heat-shock proteins, and their concentration increases 5–10-fold when the cell is subjected to thermal stress (20Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The thermotolerance of the proteins from the same organism varies, and under thermal stress, a percentage of the cell proteins begins to unfold and therefore to be recognized by GroEL, which interacts with them to prevent protein denaturation (20Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Welch W.J. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 223-278Google Scholar). The increase in GroEL and GroES levels in the cell during heat-shock conditions would therefore be used to cope with a larger amount of misfolded proteins generated as a consequence of the thermal stress. In recent work, Goloubinoff et al. (22Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggested that GroEL and GroES may function as a molecular thermometer. According to their hypothesis, GroES binding to GroEL would regulate the GroEL chaperonin activity under heat-shock conditions so that reduced GroES binding affinity toward GroEL at high temperatures would lower the overall folding activity. In this paper we have studied the effect of the temperature on the inter-ring signaling and on the substrate and GroES liberation from GroEL. We have found that as the temperature increases, substrate release from GroEL is slowed down and that this behavior is induced by a gradual loss of inter-ring signaling that modulates GroES liberation from one of the GroEL rings. The biological significance of this behavior is discussed.DISCUSSIONChaperonin GroEL is involved in assisting the folding of non-native proteins. GroEL and GroES are also heat-shock proteins, and their level of expression is increased during conditions of thermal stress, most probably to help the cell cope with the higher amount of proteins that are denatured as a consequence of the increase in temperature (21Welch W.J. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 223-278Google Scholar). Despite the importance of these chaperonins during heat-shock, few studies have analyzed the effect of temperature on their behavior (20Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Mendoza J.A. Warren T. Dulin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our results support the view that, as temperature rises to heat-shock conditions, GroEL decreases its role in protein folding and starts protecting non-native proteins from possible aggregation by slowing down their liberation. This effect is reversible and is due to a change in GroEL inter-ring signaling so that GroES release from GroEL is partially inhibited, and therefore the substrate protein remains in the cavity formed by GroEL and GroES. The reduced rate of GroES release from GroEL is surprising, since the ATPase activity of GroEL is significantly higher at heat-shock temperatures (32Mendoza J.A. Warren T. Dulin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and it would be reasonable to think that the cycle of GroES binding and liberation from GroEL would be faster. The results suggest, however, that, although hydrolysis is taking place at 45 °C at a higher rate than at 37 °C, the signal from the GroES-free ring of the asymmetric GroEL-GroES complex is not properly transmitted to the GroES-bound GroEL ring, and therefore GroES release is inhibited. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis: first, the negative cooperativity in ATP binding between the two GroEL rings is gradually abolished as the temperature increases. The existence of negative cooperativity between the two rings has been the first proof of the inter-ring communication, and our results show that this communication is gradually weakened as the temperature increases so that no negative cooperativity remains at 45 °C. The loss of inter-ring communication might explain the stabilization of the GroEL-GroES asymmetric complex under conditions where the ATPase activity of the protein is enhanced. This behavior is reversible, and as soon as the temperature is lowered to 37 °C, the negative cooperativity reappears.A second line of evidence is the appearance, during thermal stress conditions, of two structural features that are not observed during normal conditions. Electron microscopy shows that during heat-shock, a percentage of the GroEL particles appears as single rings (10%). There have been previous reports of changes affecting the inter-ring connection in GroEL when the temperature is increased (16Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xy Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 36Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The appearance of single rings together with the widening of the inter-ring spacing in the rest of the GroEL population seems to indicate that during thermal stress, the interaction between the two rings is weakened and can be eventually disrupted. The double-ring oligomers found at high temperatures do not show the same conformational changes in the apical domains that are observed at 25 °C but similar movements to what has been observed previously in the SR1 mutant and in an inter-ring communication-affected mutant (35Llorca O. Pérez-Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Galán A. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which would reinforce the notion of an inter-ring disconnection during heat-shock. However, although the effect of temperature on GroEL is sufficient to understand the altered functionality of the GroEL-GroES system, it cannot be ruled out at this stage that GroES may be also affected in its conformation and function.The results obtained lead us to suggest a working hypothesis (Fig. 6) for the transformation of GroEL from a “fold-assisting machine” at normal temperatures to a “protein store” during heat-shock conditions. According to this hypothesis, during normal conditions non-native proteins would bind to the GroES-free ring of the GroEL oligomer (Fig. 6 a). After the sequential binding of ATP and GroES to this ring, the substrate is encapsulated inside the GroEL-GroES cage (Fig. 6 b) and is free to fold to its native state or a conformation close to it (Fig. 6 c). If normal temperatures persist, the cycle would continue, and GroES would be liberated after nucleotide binding (and possibly non-native protein) to the other ring (Fig. 6 e). If conditions of thermal stress appear, a change in GroEL is induced such that the inter-ring communication is affected and the oligomer takes what we call a “single ring-like” conformation (Fig. 6 d). In this conformation, the signals derived from nucleotide binding and hydrolysis would be uncoupled to the release of GroES in the adjacent ring. This conformation would be maintained while the high temperatures remain. Once the temperature decreases, the communication between the two rings is resumed so that GroES is liberated after ATP binding to the other ring (Fig. 6 e). The changes described are reversible, and because the protein trapping is not totally efficient (there is a partial liberation of GroES and protein during heat-shock conditions), GroEL would also work, albeit with less efficiency, assisting in the folding of proteins at the heat-shock temperature tested (45 °C).It has been shown previously that, despite the single ring being the functional unit in protein folding, the existence of the double-ring structure is important for the regulation of the GroEL folding activity (16Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xy Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The results shown here present another view of the importance of the double-ring complex. The existence in the complex of an inter-ring communication that can be affected by changes in temperature offers a mechanism for a gradual switch of GroEL from a “protein folding machine” to a “protein storage device” during heat-shock conditions. This is a reasonable hypothesis since it would not be efficient for the cell, during periods of thermal stress, the folding and release by GroEL of thermounstable proteins that would be again denatured. Chaperonins are a large family of proteins found in all types of organisms and have a very important role in protein folding (1Ellis R.J. The Chaperonins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar), with GroEL from Escherichia coli and its cochaperonin GroES being the best characterized members of this family. The atomic structure of GroEL (2Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and GroES (3Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierash L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) are known and also that of the GroEL-GroES complex formed in the presence of ADP (4Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). GroEL consists of a double toroid, each one composed of seven subunits of a 58-kDa protein. The toroid encloses a cavity where folding takes place (5Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L.

Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The GroEL monomer can be separated in three well defined regions (2Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar): an equatorial domain, which holds all the inter-ring interactions and most of the intra-ring interactions, and contains the ATP binding sites; an apical domain, which contains all the residues involved in substrate and GroES binding; and an intermediate domain, which connects the apical and equatorial domains and acts as a hinge for the movements of the apical domain in response to signals generated in the equatorial domain. Upon ATP binding, GroES can bind to one or both GroEL rings, forming what has been called, respectively, an asymmetric or a symmetric complex (7Langer T. Pfeifer J. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 8Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M.

Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although very complex, the GroEL mechanism is beginning to be understood. Binding of ATP to the equatorial domain induces an upward and outward movement of the apical domain that is increased upon GroES binding (4Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 11Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.

Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic regions of the unfolded protein interact with a large patch of hydrophobic residues placed in the apical domain, at the entrance of the cavity (13Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The binding of GroES to the same hydrophobic region of GroEL caps the ring and displaces the substrate to the interior of the now much enlarged cavity where, free of any undesired interaction, it may reach its native structure (5Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 6Mayhew M. Da Silva A.C.R. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Upon GroES release, the enclosed substrate is also liberated, a fraction of which actually folds in each reaction cycle, so that several cycles of substrate and GroES binding to, and release from, GroEL are required (14Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). ATP is not directly involved in protein folding, but its binding and subsequent hydrolysis induce a functional and structural asymmetry between the two rings that is necessary for the cycling mechanism of GroEL to work. The asymmetry is based in a complex behavior of positive cooperativity of ATP binding among the subunits of the same ring and negative cooperativity with respect to the subunits of the adjacent ring (15Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). ATP binding would make possible the binding of a GroES oligomer and the liberation of the non-native polypeptide in the interior of the cavity as explained above. Only after ATP hydrolysis in the first ring would ATP be able to bind to the second ring, which would subsequently induce the liberation of GroES and the polypeptide from the first ring (16Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xy Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, a single-ring mutant is able to bind GroES but unable to release it, due to the lack of signal coming from the adjacent ring (5Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether a GroES oligomer binds to the second ring before the GroES bound to the first ring is released, although symmetrical complexes are observed in the same in vitro conditions (17Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the appearance of these complexes is related to an increase in folding efficiency (18Azem A. Diamant S. Kessel M. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12021-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 68-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). What seems to be well established, however is that, although the functional unit in protein folding is each one of the two rings (5Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), the double-ring structure and the signaling between the two rings are stringent for the folding mechanism to work (16Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xy Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Besides assisting in the folding of proteins under normal conditions, GroEL and its cochaperonin GroES are heat-shock proteins, and their concentration increases 5–10-fold when the cell is subjected to thermal stress (20Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The thermotolerance of the proteins from the same organism varies, and under thermal stress, a percentage of the cell proteins begins to unfold and therefore to be recognized by GroEL, which interacts with them to prevent protein denaturation (20Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Welch W.J. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 223-278Google Scholar). The increase in GroEL and GroES levels in the cell during heat-shock conditions would therefore be used to cope with a larger amount of misfolded proteins generated as a consequence of the thermal stress. In recent work, Goloubinoff et al. (22Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) suggested that GroEL and GroES may function as a molecular thermometer. According to their hypothesis, GroES binding to GroEL would regulate the GroEL chaperonin activity under heat-shock conditions so that reduced GroES binding affinity toward GroEL at high temperatures would lower the overall folding activity. In this paper we have studied the effect of the temperature on the inter-ring signaling and on the substrate and GroES liberation from GroEL. We have found that as the temperature increases, substrate release from GroEL is slowed down and that this behavior is induced by a gradual loss of inter-ring signaling that modulates GroES liberation from one of the GroEL rings. The biological significance of this behavior is discussed. DISCUSSIONChaperonin GroEL is involved in assisting the folding of non-native proteins. GroEL and GroES are also heat-shock proteins, and their level of expression is increased during conditions of thermal stress, most probably to help the cell cope with the higher amount of proteins that are denatured as a consequence of the increase in temperature (21Welch W.J. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 223-278Google Scholar). Despite the importance of these chaperonins during heat-shock, few studies have analyzed the effect of temperature on their behavior (20Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Science. 1992; 258: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Goloubinoff P. Diamant S. Weiss C. Azem A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Mendoza J.A. Warren T. Dulin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our results support the view that, as temperature rises to heat-shock conditions, GroEL decreases its role in protein folding and starts protecting non-native proteins from possible aggregation by slowing down their liberation. This effect is reversible and is due to a change in GroEL inter-ring signaling so that GroES release from GroEL is partially inhibited, and therefore the substrate protein remains in the cavity formed by GroEL and GroES. The reduced rate of GroES release from GroEL is surprising, since the ATPase activity of GroEL is significantly higher at heat-shock temperatures (32Mendoza J.A. Warren T. Dulin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and it would be reasonable to think that the cycle of GroES binding and liberation from GroEL would be faster. The results suggest, however, that, although hydrolysis is taking place at 45 °C at a higher rate than at 37 °C, the signal from the GroES-free ring of the asymmetric GroEL-GroES complex is not properly transmitted to the GroES-bound GroEL ring, and therefore GroES release is inhibited. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis: first, the negative cooperativity in ATP binding between the two GroEL rings is gradually abolished as the temperature increases. The existence of negative cooperativity between the two rings has been the first proof of the inter-ring communication, and our results show that this communication is gradually weakened as the temperature increases so that no negative cooperativity remains at 45 °C. The loss of inter-ring communication might explain the stabilization of the GroEL-GroES asymmetric complex under conditions where the ATPase activity of the protein is enhanced. This behavior is reversible, and as soon as the temperature is lowered to 37 °C, the negative cooperativity reappears.A second line of evidence is the appearance, during thermal stress conditions, of two structural features that are not observed during normal conditions. Electron microscopy shows that during heat-shock, a percentage of the GroEL particles appears as single rings (10%). There have been previous reports of changes affecting the inter-ring connection in GroEL when the temperature is increased (16Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xy Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 36Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The appearance of single rings together with the widening of the inter-ring spacing in the rest of the GroEL population seems to indicate that during thermal stress, the interaction between the two rings is weakened and can be eventually disrupted. The double-ring oligomers found at high temperatures do not show the same conformational changes in the apical domains that are observed at 25 °C but similar movements to what has been observed previously in the SR1 mutant and in an inter-ring communication-affected mutant (35Llorca O. Pérez-Pérez J. Carrascosa J.L. Galán A. Muga A. Valpuesta J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which would reinforce the notion of an inter-ring disconnection during heat-shock. However, although the effect of temperature on GroEL is sufficient to understand the altered functionality of the GroEL-GroES system, it cannot be ruled out at this stage that GroES may be also affected in its conformation and function.The results obtained lead us to suggest a working hypothesis (Fig. 6) for the transformation of GroEL from a “fold-assisting machine” at normal temperatures to a “protein store” during heat-shock conditions. According to this hypothesis, during normal conditions non-native proteins would bind to the GroES-free ring of the GroEL oligomer (Fig. 6 a). After the sequential binding of ATP and GroES to this ring, the substrate is encapsulated inside the GroEL-GroES cage (Fig. 6 b) and is free to fold to its native state or a conformation close to it (Fig. 6 c). If normal temperatures persist, the cycle would continue, and GroES would be liberated after nucleotide binding (and possibly non-native protein) to the other ring (Fig. 6 e). If conditions of thermal stress appear, a change in GroEL is induced such that the inter-ring communication is affected and the oligomer takes what we call a “single ring-like” conformation (Fig. 6 d). In this conformation, the signals derived from nucleotide binding and hydrolysis would be uncoupled to the release of GroES in the adjacent ring. This conformation would be maintained while the high temperatures remain. Once the temperature decreases, the communication between the two rings is resumed so that GroES is liberated after ATP binding to the other ring (Fig. 6 e). The changes described are reversible, and because the protein trapping is not totally efficient (there is a partial liberation of GroES and protein during heat-shock conditions), GroEL would also work, albeit with less efficiency, assisting in the folding of proteins at the heat-shock temperature tested (45 °C).It has been shown previously that, despite the single ring being the functional unit in protein folding, the existence of the double-ring structure is important for the regulation of the GroEL folding activity (16Rye H.S.

The results imply that the ribosomal micro-environment of the tRNAs remains the same before and after translocation and thus suggest that a movable ribosomal domain exists that tightly binds two tRNAs and carries them together with the mRNA during the translocation reaction from the A-P region to the P-E region.

Ribosomes contain three tRNA binding sites, the A, P, and E site,viz. the A site where the decoding takes place, the P site, where the peptidyl-tRNA is located before peptide bond formation, and the E site, which is specific for deacylated tRNA (1Rheinberger H.-J.

During elongation of the nascent peptide chain, each tRNA passes through the ribosomal binding sites in the sequence A → P → E. To elongate the nascent peptide chain by one amino acid, the ribosome goes through a cycle of reactions, the so-called elongation cycle. The three basic reactions of an elongation cycle are 1) occupation of the A site by an aminoacyl-tRNA according to the corresponding codon at the A site, 2) peptide-bond formation, which transfers the already synthesized peptidyl residue to the aminoacyl-tRNA so that the resulting peptidyl-tRNA, prolonged by an amino acid, now resides at the A site, and 3) the translocation reaction, which moves the peptidyl-tRNA to the P site and the deacylated tRNA to the E site. Cross-linking and footprinting studies have identified components of the ribosome that interact with the tRNAs in the specific sites (reviewed in Refs. 7Noller H.F. Annu. Rev.

Recently, a technique developed by Eckstein and co-workers (9Schatz D. Leberman R. Eckstein F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6132-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) has been used to investigate the interactions of tRNAs with ribosomal binding sites (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This method exploits the fact that the addition of iodine (I2) causes a breakage of the sugar-phosphate backbone of phosphorothioated RNA (here tRNA). The cleavage works equally well with phosphates in single or double strands. However, if tight contacts of a distinct phosphate group of a thioated tRNA with a synthetase or a ribosomal component prevents the access of iodine, the phosphate group under observation is protected, and a cleavage is not observed at this position. Highly differentiated and distinct cleavage patterns were found for A and P site-bound tRNAs in the pre-translocational (PRE)1 state (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we show that the protection patterns of both tRNAs at the A and P sites in the PRE state hardly change when translocated to P and E sites, respectively. Because probably most of the protection patterns are caused by interactions of the tRNA with the respective ribosomal binding sites, the data suggest the existence of a movable ribosomal domain that binds tightly the two tRNAs before, during, and after translocation. The sources of chemicals and plasmids are described by Dabrowskiet al. (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The thioated tRNAPhe was obtained byin vitro T7-dependent transcription (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The tRNAs were charged, N-acetylated, and purified by reverse-phase HPLC as described in Bommer et al. (11Bommer U. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Spahn C.M.T. Triana-Alonso F.J. Nierhaus K.H. Graham J. Rickwoods D. Subcellular Fractionation : A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 271-301Google Scholar). The specific activity of Ac[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe was 1000–1200 dpm/pmol for different preparations. The binding of thioated tRNAPhe to the Pi, A, PPrePPost, and E positions was performed under the ionic conditions of the binding buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.8 (0 °C), 6 mm MgCl2, 150 mmNH4Cl, 2 mm spermidine, 0.05 mmspermine, and 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) essentially as described (11Bommer U. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Spahn C.M.T. Triana-Alonso F.J. Nierhaus K.H. Graham J. Rickwoods D. Subcellular Fractionation : A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 271-301Google Scholar), with the following changes. The binding of deacylated thioated tRNA to the Pi position was performed in step one with 80 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, 80 pmol of thioated tRNAPhe, and 50 μg of poly(U) mRNA in a total volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Binding of deacylated thioated tRNAPhe to the PPreposition was performed by taking a 50-μl aliquot from the Pi binding assay and adding 60 pmol of native Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe in step two. The incubation of this step was for 30 min at 37 °C. For location of the deacylated tRNAPhe in the E position, half of the ribosomal complexes from step two were further processed in step three, where the translocation reaction took place. Binding of thioated Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe to the Pi position was performed by incubating 80 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, 104 pmol of thioated Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe, and 50 μg of poly(U) in step one. Note that we used a slightly higher amount for AcPhe-tRNA than for deacylated tRNA in the corresponding experiment described in the preceding paragraph to account for the slightly lower affinity of the P site for AcPhe-tRNA as compared for tRNAPhe (see Ref.1Rheinberger H.-J. Sternbach H. Nierhaus K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5310-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thioated Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe was bound to the A position by incubating 80 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, 104 pmol of native deacylated tRNAPhe, and 50 μg of poly(U) in step one and adding 104 pmol of thioated Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe in step two. Half of the aliquot obtained in step two was further processed in step three, yielding ribosomal complexes with thioated Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe in PPostposition and a native deacylated tRNA in the E site. The translocation efficiency for both complexes was at least 70%, as determined by puromycin reaction (11Bommer U. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Spahn C.M.T. Triana-Alonso F.J. Nierhaus K.H. Graham J. Rickwoods D. Subcellular Fractionation : A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 271-301Google Scholar) under the ionic conditions of the binding buffer. None of the bound thioated AcPhe-tRNA that was added in step two to occupy the A site reacted with puromycin, whereas more than 70% of the AcPhe-tRNA bound to the Pi position reacted with puromycin under the conditions applied. The method used for footprinting experiments followed that described in Dabrowski et al. (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) except that the iodine cleavage was started by adding to the mixture with the thioated tRNAs 1/50 volume of 50 mm iodine in ethanol solution (2% ethanol final concentration). After 1 min at 0 °C, the nonbound tRNA was removed from the ribosomal complexes by gel-filtration over a Sephacryl-S300 cDNA Spun column (2 min, 4 °C, 1500 rpm, HB4 rotor). We included in Fig. 1 A (left panel) the cleavage pattern of nonthioated, transcribed tRNA in the presence of iodine as a control. Practically no cleavage was observed with thioated tRNA bound to ribosomes in the absence of iodine (Fig. 1 B, right panel). We also tried to add I2 after the gel-filtration step instead of before. However, the resulting cleavage pattern was less defined. A possible explanation is that the reaction time of iodine was well terminated by the gel-filtration if added before, thus preventing secondary reactions.Figure 1Autoradiograms of a footprinting experiment showing A, G, U, and C cleavages at these positions, respectively; O, tRNA contains no thioates (only spontaneous breakages are visible). Spontaneous breakages are not seen in all experiments (see for example, Figs. 3 and 5 in Ref. 10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H.

Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The intensities of all As are given relative to that of A9. Likewise G10, C11, and U12 were the reference bands for all Gs, Cs, and Us, respectively. The control bands have an intensity comparable with most of the other bands and do not seem to be affected by the tertiary structure of the tRNAs in solution. The data shown in Table I were obtained in the following way. The values of the horizontal comparison (the intensity of a band of a bound tRNA relative to the corresponding band of a tRNA in solution) were multiplied by the relative intensities of the corresponding bands derived from the vertical scanning of free tRNA. The result of the multiplication gives the intensity of a band of ribosomal bound AcPhe-tRNA or tRNAPhe relative to the respective control band of AcPhe-tRNA or tRNAPhe in solution, respectively (vertical comparison). For example, U16 of AcPhe-tRNA in solution has an intensity of 0.24 relative to U12 of AcPhe-tRNA in solution (vertical scanning); U16 of AcPhe-tRNA in the Pposÿ site has a relative intensity of 4.33 compared with U16 of AcPhe-tRNA in solution (horizontal comparison). The product of both numbers, 0.24 × 4.33 = 1.04, gives the intensity of U16 of AcPhe-tRNA in the PPost site relative to U12 of AcPhe-tRNA in solution (vertical comparison). U16 of AcPhe-tRNA shows an enhanced accessibility when bound to the ribosome, because iodine cleavage at U16 of the free AcPhe-tRNA is restricted because of the conformation of the tRNA. A conformational change of AcPhe-tRNA upon binding relieves this restriction.Table IAccessibilities of the phosphates of the tRNAs in the various states: AcPhe-tRNA in the A (AcA) and PPost (AcPPost) sites and deacylated tRNAPhe in the PPre(dePPre), E (deE) and A (deA) sites.PositionAcAAcPpostdePpredeEdeAG1–C4NDNDNDNDNDG50.10.30.00.0NDG60.40.40.10.1NDA70.50.50.10.2NDU8NDND0.00.1NDA90.30.2NDNDNDG100.20.20.10.00.3C110.10.10.00.00.2U121.01.00.20.20.5C131.11.00.20.30.4A141.21.10.40.70.2G150.60.60.10.10.3U160.71.00.20.20.4C171.21.50.70.70.5G181.31.30.80.81.0G190.90.80.40.30.5U200.30.60.20.20.2A210.60.70.30.40.1G220.30.40.10.10.2A230.20.30.10.10.1G240.40.50.10.10.3C250.80.90.20.30.3A260.40.30.30.50.2G270.20.20.10.10.2G280.40.90.30.20.4G290.50.50.20.20.5G300.80.50.20.30.7A310.60.30.00.10.2U320.20.20.00.00.6U330.20.30.20.30.7G340.10.10.10.30.2A350.20.20.60.70.5A360.30.30.50.60.6A370.51.00.60.70.7A380.40.50.81.00.8U390.50.60.30.30.6C40–C431.21.40.40.50.5G440.40.60.20.20.4U450.50.90.20.20.7G460.90.80.70.7NDU471.92.50.70.61.2C481.11.30.80.71.7C491.21.50.40.51.3U500.30.70.10.10.9U511.31.50.30.31.2G520.40.30.10.10.5G530.40.80.30.30.6U540.70.80.10.10.7U550.61.00.20.20.9C560.10.20.10.10.3G570.30.20.10.10.3A580.10.10.00.10.1U590.20.40.10.10.8U600.30.50.10.10.8C61–C620.91.40.40.30.9G630.40.40.20.20.5A640.30.50.10.20.2G650.30.50.20.1NDU660.40.60.10.10.7C67–A76NDNDNDNDNDThe numbers give the intensity relative to the corresponding control band (A9, G10, C11, or G12) of the respective tRNA in solution (vertical comparison; see “Experimental Procedures”).

ND, not determined. The average difference between the intensities of any corresponding bands of two patterns were calculated in the following way: The absolute values of the differences for all corresponding bands were taken, and the mean of these values was calculated. AcPhe-tRNA in the PPost site has only 4 differences of 63 positions when compared with AcPhe-tRNA in the Pi site (not shown), and the average deviation is 0.14. If the Pi and PPre site of tRNAPhe are compared, the average deviation 0.11 is also low. Phosphorothioated tRNAs were the product of an in vitro transcription. About four phosphorothioates were randomly incorporated at either the A, G, U, or C positions during transcription. The resulting tRNAs could be easily acylated with phenylalanine and were active in binding to ribosomal binding sites and poly(Phe) synthesis (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The thioated deacylated tRNAPhe and AcPhe-tRNA were bound to poly(U)-programmed ribosomes to either P or A sites, respectively, and the corresponding contact patterns were analyzed before and after translocation. After forming the ribosomal complexes, the thioated (5′-32P)tRNA was cleaved with iodine as described previously, and the RNA was applied to a denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The band intensity of each position was assessed by scanning and compared with the corresponding position of a tRNA in solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). A weaker band intensity resulting from binding to the ribosome means a restriction of the cleavage reaction because of steric hindrance, thus impairing the access of I2 so that a close ribosomal contact can be assumed at this position of the tRNA. An enhancement of the band intensity of a ribosome-bound tRNA compared with the one in solution indicates a conformational change of the tRNA upon binding to the ribosome; phosphates in bent regions of tRNA seem to be more accessible to iodine (12Rudinger J. Puglisi J.D. Putz J. Schatz D. Eckstein F. Florentz C. Giege R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5882-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There is still another possibility why a band intensity could be weakened. Thioates at certain positions could hinder the binding of the tRNA to the ribosome so that these tRNAs are removed by gel-filtration and are not applied to the sequencing gel. Control experiments have demonstrated that deacylated tRNAPhe could not be bound to ribosomes when thioated at position A9; the same was true for AcPhe-tRNA when it was thioated at position U8 (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These two positions and those in gel extremes (∼1–5 and ∼69–76) could not be identified (because of their localization) and were classified as “not determinable” in Table I and Figs. 2 and 3.Figure 3Difference patterns of thioated tRNAs (see Table I).

Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Only the initiating ribosome contains a single tRNA at the P site. Therefore we distinguish the initiating ribosome with one tRNA at the Pisite (i for initiating) and the elongating ribosome with tRNAs at the A and the PPre sites (PRE for pre-translocational state) or at the PPost and the E sites (POST forpost-translocational). PRE complexes were prepared with a thioated AcPhe-tRNA at the A site or a thioated tRNAPhe at the P site. The second tRNA in the complex was a native tRNAPhe or AcPhe-tRNA, respectively. According to the puromycin reaction, 100% of the bound AcPhe-tRNA was present at the A site. The cleavage patterns of both complexes were analyzed before and after an elongation factor-G-dependent translocation. More than 70% of the AcPhe-tRNA bound to the A site was translocated to the PPost site as indicated by the puromycin reaction. Furthermore, the cleavage pattern of AcPhe-tRNA and tRNAPhe was analyzed in the Pi site. An autoradiogram of such a footprinting experiment for AcPhe-tRNA in the three investigated sites (A, PPost, and Pi) is shown in Fig. 1 A. The cleavage patterns for tRNAPhe in PPre, E sites, and Pi is shown in Fig. 1 B. The gels were scanned, and the relative intensities of the bands were compared with the corresponding bands of AcPhe-tRNA or tRNAPhe in solution. The error spread between independent experiments was around ±15% as in previous experiments (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a summary of the results. Strongly protected nucleotides (intensity < 30% that of of the corresponding band of the tRNA in solution) and nucleotides with enhanced accessibility (intensity > 130%) are indicated within the tertiary model of the tRNA. Previously we have shown that the protection patterns of AcPhe-tRNA in the A site and deacylated tRNAPhe in the P site are different, whereas there is hardly a difference between tRNAPhe in the Pi and PPost sites (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The surprising result in this study is that there is a striking difference between P site-bound AcPhe-tRNA (PPost or Pi) and P site-bound tRNAPhe (PPre or Pi), whereas the three protection patterns of AcPhe-tRNA in the various states seem to be very similar. The same is true for the three protection patterns obtained with tRNAPhe. All are very similar to each other (Fig. 2, A–F). In all three states of tRNAPhe (Pi, PPre, E sites) the protection is much stronger than the protection patterns observed with AcPhe-tRNA. tRNAPhe shows more than 30 strongly protected positions in each ribosomal binding state, in contrast to the maximal 9 positions found in the AcPhe-tRNA (A and PPost). On the other hand, only a few positions of enhanced accessibility (maximum 3) are found with tRNAPhe, whereas for AcPhe-tRNA these positions are numerous (minimum 13). The stronger protection of the deacylated tRNA at the P and E sites probably reflects a more compactly folded structure. The data obtained by horizontal comparison (intensity of a position relative to the corresponding band of the tRNA in solution, Fig. 2) indicate the changes of the reactivities upon binding to a ribosomal site compared with the reactivities of the tRNAs in solution. We have shown previously that tRNAPhe and AcPhe-tRNA in solution show a different cleavage pattern, probably because there is a conformational change in the tRNA upon aminoacylation (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation, namely that the differences are caused by selection by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, is unlikely because (i) it was not observed in binding studies of thioated tRNAs to the corresponding synthetase (9Schatz D. Leberman R. Eckstein F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6132-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and (ii) the levels of aminoacylation of native tRNAs and phosphorothioated tRNA were almost the same (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but should be severely reduced with phosphorothioated tRNA if such a selection would take place. Indeed, a conformational change caused by aminoacylation was directly observed in fluorescence studies (14Hardesty B. Odom O.W. D. H.-Y. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function, and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1986: 495-508Google Scholar, 15Hardesty B. Odom P.W. Czworkowski J. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 366-372Google Scholar) and revealed by electrophoresis through perpendicular denaturing gradient gels (16Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8300-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data derived from the horizontal comparison might not properly reflect the differences between the patterns of AcPhe-tRNA and tRNAPhe. To eliminate the influence of the conformation of the free tRNA, the reactivities of the bound tRNAs were normalized to a fixed set of reference bands of the corresponding free tRNAs, namely A9, G10, C11, or U12 (see “Experimental Procedures”). These values are given in Table I (vertical comparison) and were used for the difference calculations (Fig. 3). We consider differences between the intensities of two positions as significant if they are different by at least a factor of two and if the higher value is not below 0.3. Furthermore, we calculated an average deviation between two patterns (see “Experimental Procedures”) to be independent from arbitrarily chosen criteria of differences. If AcPhe-tRNA in the A site is compared with AcPhe-tRNA in the PPost site (Fig. 3 A) or the Pisite (not shown), 8 of 61 positions are different. The average deviation of a band from an AcPhe-tRNA at the PPost site to that at the A site is only 0.16. Practically no difference is observed when the patterns of tRNAPhe in PPre and E site, respectively, are compared (Fig. 3 C), and the average deviation is 0.05. It follows that the protection patterns of AcPhe-tRNA are very similar before and after translocation. The deacylated tRNA before and after translocation at the PPreand the E sites, respectively, shows practically an identical pattern. In contrast, when PPost-site bound AcPhe-tRNA is compared with PPre-site bound tRNAPhe, 40 of 60 positions differ in their protection pattern (Fig. 3 B), and the average deviation (0.44) of a band is much larger. Similarly, a comparison of the pattern of AcPhe-tRNA with that of tRNAPhe in the Pi sites reveals a large number of differences (35 of 60; not shown); the average deviation is 0.40. Therefore, the tRNAs seem to interact with different binding sites, although conventional understanding assigns them to the same binding site, the P site. A pattern specific for deacylated tRNAPhe was found regardless of whether the tRNAPhe was present at the P or E sites. Similarly, a pattern specific for AcPhe-tRNA was found when bound to either A or P sites. Do the two distinct contact patterns depend on the charging state of the tRNA rather than reflect different features of ribosomal binding sites? We analyzed this problem in the following control experiment. Ribosomes were programmed with the MF-mRNA (17Triana-Alonso F.J. Dabrowski M. Wadzack J. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6298-6307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which is a heteropolymeric mRNA of 46 nucleotides and carries the two unique codons AUG-UUC in the middle. A deacylated and thioated tRNAPhe was bound either to the A site after prefilling the P site with a deacylated tRNAfMet or to the Pi site. When the thioated tRNAPhe was present at the Pisite, a pattern known for deacylated tRNA was observed (not shown). In contrast, tRNAPhe in the A site showed a different pattern (Table I). 30 of 51 positions differed in their intensities as compared with tRNAPhe in the PPre site (Fig. 3 D). 19 of these 30 positions approach a reactivity of the corresponding positions of AcPhe-tRNA in the A site. It seems that tRNAPhe in the A site adopts a protection pattern similar to that of AcPhe-tRNA in the same site. Some nucleotides still show a protection state typical for the tRNAPhe pattern (especially the anticodon, e.g. A35, A36). In contrast, many others show a typical AcPhe-tRNA protection (Table I), for example nucleotides within the anticodon stem (G26, G30, U39), the extra arm (G44, U45), and the TψC stem loop (C49, U51-U55, C61-G63). A calculation of the average difference between the corresponding nucleotides of two patterns revealed the following. The pattern of a deacylated tRNAPhe at the PPre site is very different to that of a deacylated tRNAPhe at the A site (average difference 0.31). The difference between PPostsite-bound AcPhe-tRNA and PPre site-bound tRNAPhe (0.44) is significantly larger than the corresponding value of A site- bound tRNAs (0.26), i.e. the difference between AcPhe-tRNA and tRNAPhe bound to the A site. Thus, the pattern of a tRNAPhe at the A site deviates sharply from that of a tRNAPhe at the P site but approaches that of an AcPhe-tRNA at the A site, although significant differences are observed. It is clear that both the charging state of a tRNA as well as the features of a ribosomal binding site severely affect the corresponding protection pattern of the tRNA. It has been shown previously that strikingly different contact patterns were observed with deacylated tRNAPhe at the P site and AcPhe-tRNA at the A site of ribosomes before translocation (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the distinct pattern of either tRNA hardly changes during translocation to the P and E sites, respectively. Two ways were used to calculate and compare the relative intensities of a band. 1) The intensity of a position of a bound tRNA was calculated relative to the corresponding band of the tRNA in solution (horizontal comparison). 2) The intensities of, for example, all A nucleotides of a bound tRNA were related to the reference band A9 of the corresponding tRNA in solution (vertical comparison, see “Experimental Procedures,” “Processing of the Data”). Both methods of data processing clearly reveal that the protection patterns of AcPhe-tRNA in the investigated binding sites (A, PPost, Pi) are similar as well as those of tRNAPhe in the PPre, E, and Pi sites, whereas both types of patterns are strikingly different. The intensities of the corresponding nucleotide positions of an AcPhe-tRNA at either the A or the PPost site differ by 0.16 on average. A difference of only 0.05 is found, if correspondingly, the patterns of deacylated tRNAPhe at PPre and E sites are compared. However, the average difference is about 0.4 between an AcPhe-tRNA pattern and that of a tRNAPhe. The type of pattern observed with AcPhe-tRNA at the A site before and at the P site after translocation is termed α (α, because only the α-like pattern is found at the A site). Correspondingly, we define the type of pattern seen of deacylated tRNA at the P and the E sites before and after translocation, respectively, as the ε pattern (ε, because only the ε-like pattern is observed at the E site). A few positions at the 5′ and the 3′ ends could not be judged in our analysis, but at least the CCA-3′ end has been tested already by chemical probing. The protection pattern at the CCA end did not change during translocation from the A to the P site (18Douthwaite S. Garrett R.A. Wagner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in agreement with our findings. Although the conformation of both tRNA species in solution seems to be different, there is evidence that binding to the ribosome equalizes the conformations of deacyl-tRNA and AcPhe-tRNA (10Dabrowski M. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a control experiment demonstrated that the protection pattern is not mainly determined by the charging state of the tRNA, because tRNAPhe, when bound to the A site, definitively shows not an ε pattern (Fig. 3 D) but approaches the α pattern. Therefore we prefer the view that most of the protections of the ribosome-bound tRNAs are because of direct contacts with the ribosome, and that the differences in the α and ε protection patterns reflect interactions with different ribosomal components. This interpretation seems to be justified because the contact patterns of thioated tRNAs in a complex with synthetase correlates well with x-ray analysis data (12Rudinger J. Puglisi J.D. Putz J. Schatz D. Eckstein F. Florentz C. Giege R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5882-5886Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,19Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), i.e. the protection pattern is directly related to the binding site. Even if some protections are caused by a conformational change upon binding, this change is caused by interactions with the ribosome, viz. reflects interactions between the tRNA and the binding site. The data suggest that the micro-environment of the tRNAs does not change during translocation, i.e. components of the ribosome, which are in contact with the tRNAs and are responsible for the protection patterns, are the same before and after translocation. This is surprising, because according to previous models of translocation, differences would be expected between A site- and P site-bound AcPhe-tRNA as well as between P site- and E site-bound tRNAPhe, whereas the patterns of P site-located deacyl-tRNA and AcPhe-tRNA would be expected to be similar. Our results are supported by other studies. (i) AcPhe-tRNA protects a similar set of nucleotides of 23 S rRNA in the A and in the P site, whereas a different set of nucleotides was protected by P site- or E site-located tRNAPhe (20Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). (ii) Recently, the 23 S rRNA neighborhood of deacylated tRNAs was analyzed in the P and E sites (21Bullard J.M. Vanwaes M.A. Bucklin D.J. Hill W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The tRNAs contained up to five randomly incorporated 4-thiouridines to which a phenanthroline was attached. This residue cleaved nucleic acids in the presence of Cu2+ ions within about 20 Å of the site of the attachment. 118 cleavage sites were detected, 85% of which were identical at P and E sites, also supporting the view that the ribosomal micro-environment of the tRNAs in the two sites does not change. (iii) Finally, our observation that tRNAPhe and AcPhe-tRNA at the Pi site show highly different patterns is in agreement with results from energy transfer studies using fluorescent probes. The fluorescence signals from deacylated tRNA and AcPhe-tRNA at the Pi position were so different that the authors concluded that that these tRNAs must be present at different sites (14Hardesty B. Odom O.W. D. H.-Y. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function, and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1986: 495-508Google Scholar, 15Hardesty B. Odom P.W. Czworkowski J. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 366-372Google Scholar). Those results also suggested that AcPhe-tRNA did not change the site when translocated from the A to the P position, again in accord with the findings reported here. On one hand, we find that the micro-environment of both tRNAs on the elongating ribosome does not change during translocation. On the other hand, it is known that the mRNA moves three nucleotides through the ribosome in the course of translocation (22Beyer D. Skripkin E. Wadzack J. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30713-30717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also the mass centers of gravity of both the mRNA (23Jünemann R. Burkhardt N. Wadzack J. Schmitt M. Willumeit R. Stuhrmann H.B. Nierhaus K.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 807-818Google Scholar) and the two tRNAs move 12 Å within the ribosome (24Wadzack J. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Diedrich G. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Penczek P. Meerwinck W. Schmitt M. Willumeit R. Stuhrmann H.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in good agreement with the length of one codon. Most important, the two tRNAs turn by an angle of at least 20° during translocation (25Nierhaus K.H. Wadzack J. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Meerwinck W. Willumeit R. Stuhrmann H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Stark H. Orlova E.V. Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Mueller F. Rodnina M. Wintermeyer W. Brimacombe R. van Heel M. Cell. 1997; 88: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Such a turn means that the elbows of the two L-shaped tRNAs change their positions considerably and move even more than 12 Å during translocation. This paradox can be resolved if one assumes that a domain of the ribosome moves together with the tRNAs and the mRNA during the translocation reaction. This assumption gives a simple explanation for the translocation reaction: the tRNAs do not dissociate from A and P sites to diffuse to P and E sites, respectively; instead the tRNAs are tightly bound to the movable conveyor before, during, and after the translocation reaction. Translocation can be achieved by the ribosome via a movement of this conveyor from the A and P positions to the P and E positions, respectively; thereby the bound tRNAs are translocated. The movable ribosomal domain that binds two tRNAs tightly and transports them during the translocation reaction is termed α-ε domain according to the corresponding protection patterns. According to this model the critical step of the elongation cycle is not the translocation as in previous models but rather the A site occupation. During this reaction, the conveyor has to be moved back to A and P positions, whereas the peptidyl-tRNA has to stay at the P site, and the deacyl-tRNA has to be released from the E site. The view that the A site occupation is characterized by a major rearrangement between the (tRNA)2·mRNA complex and the ribosome is consistent with the observations that the occupation of the A region and not the translocation reaction is the rate-limiting step of the elongation cycle (27Bilgin N. Kirsebom L.A. Ehrenberg M. Kurland C.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Schilling-Bartetzko S. Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4703-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A candidate for a movable α-ε domain is the so-called “bridge 2,” which is the most massive connection between the ribosomal subunits going from the decoding region of the small subunit to the region of the peptidyltransferase on the large ribosomal subunit (29Frank J. Zhu J. Penczek P. Li Y.H. Srivastava S. Verschoor A. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Lata R.K. Agrawal R.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Indeed, there are close contacts between Pi site-bound fMet-tRNAfMet and this intersubunit bridge, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (30Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I.S. Grassucci R.A. Jünemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, those regions of the AcPhe-tRNA exposed at the Pi site (part of the anticodon stem and the D loop, see Fig. 2 C) seem to be also freely accessible in the cryo-electron microscopy analysis, whereas higher densities of protection sites are found at regions of contacts between the fMet-tRNA and the ribosomal matrix (30Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I.S. Grassucci R.A. Jünemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, a good correspondence between protections and contact sites exists with tRNA-ribosome complexes as has been already observed with tRNA-synthetase complexes mentioned above. The conclusions drawn from the protection patterns are not easy to reconcile with hybrid states of tRNA binding. The hybrid-site model suggests that in the PRE state, AcPhe-tRNA is bound in an A/P and deacyl-tRNA in a P/E hybrid state (20Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). After translocation, the AcPhe-tRNA should be bound in the P/P state and the deacyl-tRNA in the E site. In the case of true hybrid states, one would expect striking changes in the protection mainly of the anticodon stem loop structure of the tRNAs. In contrast, we observe that the few differences between the patterns of AcPhe-tRNA before and after translocation at the A and P site, respectively, are scattered over the whole molecule (Fig. 3 A) and are not clustered at the anticodon domain. In contrast, the experimental data on which the hybrid-site model is based can be reconciled with an elongation model that incorporates the concept of a movable, ribosomal α-ε domain translocating the tRNAs,i.e. the α-ε model (for discussion see Refs. 31Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 95-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and32Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 753-772PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our results suggest that the same ribosomal components are in contact with the tRNAs before and after translocation,viz. are moving together with the tRNAs during the translocation reaction, thus providing a new explanation for this reaction. The mRNA are connected with the two tRNAs on the ribosome via codon-anticodon interactions. It seems that the mRNA passively follows the movement of both tRNAs during the translocation reaction, because a similar analysis with thioated mRNA has revealed that no contacts exist between phosphate groups of an mRNA and the ribosome outside the decoding region (33Alexeeva E.V. Shpanchenko O.V. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Nierhaus K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2228-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this view, essentially the tRNAs are pulling the mRNA through the ribosome, underscoring the importance of maintenance of codon-anticodon interactions before and during translocation (13Nierhaus K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Alexeeva E.V. Shpanchenko O.V. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Nierhaus K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2228-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It turns out that it is not the translocation reaction but rather the molecular mechanism of A-site occupation that is puzzling. We thank Drs. N. Burkhardt, G. Diedrich, R. Jünemann, and J. Beckmann for discussions."

Many of the concepts that underlie the current understanding of both steroid hormone action and the role of chromatin in the regulation of gene expression have sprung from studies employing the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)1 long terminal repeat (LTR) as a model promoter. Target sequences related to a TGTTCT motif direct hormone-induced transcription by glucocorticoid receptors (GR), progesterone receptors (PR), and mineralocorticoid and androgen receptors (1Chandler V.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5263-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In stable chromatin, the MMTV LTR also directs the assembly of an ordered nucleosome array that represses loading of basal transcription factors on the promoter. Activation of GR or PR by hormones promotes the remodeling of the MMTV chromatin and the loading of basal transcription factors. In contrast, nucleosomes are randomly arrayed on transiently transfected MMTV templates. Such templates exhibit elevated constitutive levels of transcription factor loading and promoter activity and, consequently, a reduced induction by hormones (9Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 10Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 11Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Thus, the organization of chromatin and its remodeling by steroid hormones are critical to appropriate steroid-mediated regulation. Although GR and PR recognize the same target elements and each induces certain genes regulated by the other receptor, the two receptors mediate very different actions in tissues such as the mammary epithelium that can express both receptors. GR and PR are expressed at comparable levels in the T47D(A1–2) mammary carcinoma cell line. This cell line also contains 10 copies of a stably transfected MMTV-luciferase (LUC) reporter gene. Surprisingly, luciferase is induced by glucocorticoids but is almost entirely refractory to progestins, whereas a transiently transfected template, MMTV-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), is responsive to both hormones. On the MMTV-LUC template, glucocorticoids induce remodeling of chromatin, whereas progestins fail to do so (12Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Selectivity between two regulators that recognize the same target element could be a property inherent to a promoter sequence, a property that cannot be reconstituted on transient chromatin. Alternatively, the chromatin at the site of integration of a transgene may impose a selective mechanism on the integrated promoter. Examples of integration site determining whether a gene is expressed or silenced range from mating type choice in yeast and position effect variegation in Drosophila to recombinant transgenes in mice. However, there is little precedent for more subtle controls such as the imposition of selectivity between two related transcription factors that employ the same target elements. In this report, we address the mechanism that enforces a selective response of MMTV-LUC to glucocorticoids in T47D(A1–2) cells. We show that after stable integration, a second MMTV-driven reporter gene, MMTV-CAT, is responsive to both glucocorticoids and progestins in T47D(A1–2) cells. The responsiveness of MMTV to hormone treatment is reflected in the ability of the GR and PR to remodel MMTV chromatin in an integration site-specific manner. Progestin treatment leads to remodeling of the MMTV-CAT promoter but not MMTV-LUC, whereas glucocorticoids promote chromatin remodeling of both. We also investigated the effect of increased histone acetylation on chromatin remodeling and gene activation of MMTV-LUC and MMTV-CAT in this cell line. Surprisingly, the steroid-dependent induction of the MMTV promoter is potentiated at one chromosomal location but inhibited at another. These studies provide evidence for the imposition of locus-specific constraints in steroid hormone regulation of gene expression. The plasmids pHHLUC and pHHCAT contain MMTV sequences from HaeIII(−224) toHpaII(+100) upstream of the coding sequences for the firefly luciferase gene and the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene, respectively. For stable transfection, 1 × 106 T47D(A1–2) cells/10-cm dish were plated and allowed to grow for 24 h before transfection in minimal essential medium plus 200 μg/ml G418. One hour before transfection, the culture medium was changed to allow proper pH equilibrium. A calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate was prepared essentially according to Wigler et al. (13Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). One milliliter of this mixture containing a total of 21 μg/ml DNA (20 μg/ml pHHCAT plus 1 μg/ml pSV2hygro) was added to the culture dishes containing 10 ml of growth medium. After 4 h, the media were removed, and the cells were washed briefly in serum-free minimal essential medium and subjected to a glycerol shock for 3 min. Shock medium is 10% glycerol in HTB buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 6 mm dextrose, 21 mm HEPES, pH 7.1). Cells were then washed once with serum-free minimal essential medium and returned to growth medium for 24 h. At that time, medium was replaced with a 50:50 mixture of fresh growth medium and conditioned medium containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. Conditioned growth medium was collected as spent medium from confluent cultures of T47D cells. The selection medium was changed every 3 days. Individual colonies were harvested with cloning rings. Two independent colonies were successfully expanded. These clones contained both pHHCAT and pHHLUC and are referred to as T47D(C&L) cells. Both clones were maintained in growth medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 and hygromycin B. For reporter gene assays, cell monolayers were rinsed twice with wash buffer (40 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Cells were lysed by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mmK2PO4, pH 7.8, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100). The lysate was transferred to a microfuge tube and centrifuged for 2 min to pellet cell debris. Luciferase and CAT assays were performed exactly as described previously (12Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase assays were performed using a Phospha-Light kit (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except the 2× buffer contained 0.2 mdiethanolamine (pH 9.5), 2 mm MgCl2. The protein concentration of each extract was determined by dye binding using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). Nuclease accessibility assays were performed essentially as described previously (12Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Intact nuclei isolated from hormone-treated T47D(C&L) cells were treated withSacI followed by linear amplification of gene-specific primers with Taq polymerase. SacI cleaves a site found within nucleosome B. Nucleosome B spans MMTV DNA from about nucleotide −221 to −75 including the steroid receptor binding sites (Fig. 2 A). In untreated cells, nucleosome B prevents transcription factor access to promoter elements required for basal expression from the MMTV promoter (9Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and, in isolated nuclei, preventsSacI cleavage. The primers used in the linear polymerase chain reaction amplifications were 5′-CCATTTTACCAACAGTACCG-3′ for luciferase and 5′-CAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTG-3′ for CAT. For FISH analysis, DNA probes were labeled with biotin by nick translation using a BioNick labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) or with digoxigenin using a mixture of dNTPs (including digoxigenin-dUTP) from Boehringer Mannheim. Chromosome preparations were submitted to the following procedure before hybridization: treatment with 70% glacial acetic acid for 1 min, digestion with RNase A (100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, dehydration in an ethanol series, denaturation in 70% formamide/2× SSC (pH 7.0) at 70 °C for 2 min followed by dehydration in an ethanol series. The digoxigenin-labeled luciferase probe was denatured at 70 °C for 10 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The biotin-labeled Cot-1 probe was denatured for 10 min at 70 °C and placed on ice. Selected sections of the preparation were exposed to 10 μl of the hybridization mixture (100 ng of luciferase digoxigenin, 50 ng of Cot-1 biotin in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2× SSC, 1% Tween 20), covered with coverslips, and sealed with rubber cement. Hybridization was allowed to occur in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 48 h. Three posthybridization washes were performed at 45 °C for 15 min each with 50% formamide and 2× SSC (pH 7.0), 0.3× SSC (pH 7.0), and then 2× SSC (pH 7.0). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TN buffer (0.1 mTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), biotinylated probes were detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate (green), and digoxigenin-labeled probes were detected by rhodamine (red) using an Oncor double detection kit. The selected areas of the slides were then counterstained with DAPI/antifade solution and covered with glass coverslips. Analyses were performed on metaphase spreads of the specimen/probe combination under an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss AXIOSKOP) using interference filter sets for DAPI, fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas red, and a triple band pass filter (DAPI/fluorescein isothiocyanate/Texas red). For documentation, images were captured using an Olympus BX50 system equipped with a similar set of interference filters and a CCD camera (Photometrics). Images were processed in a digital image analysis system using BDS-image software (Oncor). GTG banding analysis was performed using Applied Imaging CytoVision software. n-Butyric acid (free acid) was obtained from Sigma. Trichostatin A was obtained from Wako (Richmond). For histone analysis, aliquots of nuclei prepared forin vivo chromatin analysis were resuspended in 200 μl of histone isolation buffer A (120 mm NaCl, 25 mmEDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and placed on ice for 30 min with mixing every 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min, and supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube. This procedure was repeated using histone isolation buffer B (250 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) followed by histone isolation buffer C (2m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The combined supernatants were brought to 0.28m HCl and placed on ice for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube and made 20% in trichloroacetic acid and placed on ice for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once with acetone containing 0.2% HCl followed by two washes with acetone alone. The pellets were dried and resuspended in acid/urea loading buffer (6 murea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glacial acetic acid, 0.2% methyl green). Histones were analyzed on acid/urea/Triton gels as described (14Alfageme C.R. Zweidler A. Mahowald A. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3729-3736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish whether selective induction of the MMTV-LUC genes in T47D(A1–2) cells is an inherent property of stable versus transient chromatin or is imposed on MMTV by the properties of integration site(s), we stably introduced another MMTV-driven transcription unit (MMTV-CAT) into T47D(A1–2) cells and examined its regulation in response to glucocorticoids or progestins. A clone derived from this transfection, T47D(C&L), expressed comparable levels of GR and PR like the parent T47D(A1–2) line and contained one to two copies of MMTV-CAT (data not shown). In contrast to the selective glucocorticoid induction of LUC (Fig. 1 A), both progestins and glucocorticoids induced CAT activity to a similar level in T47D(C&L) cells (Fig. 1 B). We also examined expression of an endogenous hormone-regulated gene, the liver/bone/kidney form of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). R5020 induces ALP to levels as high or higher than seen with dexamethasone (Fig. 1 C). Virtually identical LUC, CAT, and ALP induction results were observed in a second, independent MMTV-CAT-transfected clone (data not shown). It is unlikely that the difference in inducibility of MMTV-CAT and MMTV-LUC is attributable to the reporter gene itself. Stably integrated MMTV-LUC is inducible by both progestins and glucocorticoids in another cell line we have constructed. Also, a recent report describes a cell line with integrated MMTV-CAT genes that are differentially induced by glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (15Bonovich M.T. List H.J. Zhang S. Danielsen M. Riegel A.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that differential induction is not determined by the structural gene or simply the packaging into stable chromatin but, as we suggest, by the chromosomal context of the transcription unit. Thus, the chromatin environment at the site of MMTV integration can have a profound influence on the nature of its regulation by steroid hormones. In stable chromatin, an ordered array of nucleosomes is assembled on the MMTV LTR (9Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The steroid receptor target elements are present in DNA assembled into nucleosome B (10Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M.

Previous studies using an in vivo nuclease accessibility assay showed that the differential inducibility of the MMTV promoter in T47D(A1–2) cells was associated with the failure of progestins to promote the remodeling of MMTV chromatin (12Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used a similar assay to assess the action of GR and PR at the MMTV promoter in T47D(C&L) cells (Fig. 2 A). Glucocorticoids induced chromatin remodeling (increased SacI sensitivity) of nucleosome B of MMTV from both LUC and CAT loci. Progestins likewise induced chromatin remodeling of MMTV-CAT yet at the same time failed to induce remodeling of the MMTV-LUC transgenes in the same cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Further evidence that differential hormone induction of MMTV-LUC is functionally linked to rearrangement of nucleosome B in the MMTV-LUC promoter was provided when we used the histone deacetylase inhibitor butyric acid. Hormone-induced chromatin remodeling of the MMTV-LUC promoter was unchanged or enhanced following butyrate (Fig. 2 B) at the same time butyrate consistently suppressed remodeling at the MMTV-CAT promoter (Fig. 2 C). These results correlate with the enhancement of GR-mediated transcription of MMTV-LUC and the suppression of GR- and PR-mediated transcription of MMTV-CAT (see below). The inability of PR to remodel MMTV chromatin and induce LUC expression is unlikely to be due to a failure to bind to the PR target elements. We infer that receptor target sites in MMTV-LUC are available to PR because coadministration of R5020 with dexamethasone inhibits the glucocorticoid induction of MMTV-LUC (12Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ligand-bound PR competes for binding to target sites on the MMTV promoter with hormone-activated GR. It is unlikely that this inhibition is attributable to competition for coactivators rather than competition for binding target elements, because transcriptionally inactive PR bound to a ligand antagonist also suppresses the glucocorticoid induction of luciferase (16Gass E.K. Leonhardt S.A. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1905-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanistic implication of the data is that MMTV chromatin at the LUC loci is structured in a novel fashion under the influence of the surrounding chromatin so as to abrogate the remodeling and concomitant gene induction that would normally occur following PR binding to its target elements. This abrogation may result from the inability of PR to interact with chromatin remodeling proteins that are necessary for steroid receptor-mediated gene induction (17Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 18Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H.

In contrast, the ability of GR to initiate remodeling of MMTV-LUC chromatin and transcriptional induction is not impaired. To explore the nature of the integration site(s) of MMTV-LUC transgenes in T47D(A1–2) cells, FISH analysis was performed with a probe specific for luciferase. Approximately 50 metaphases were analyzed per hybridization site. Four fluorescent bands were detected in the long arm of a single, C size, submetacentric, marker chromosome in all cells analyzed (Fig. 3 A). Cot-1 repetitive DNA was used to paint metaphase chromosomes. Cot-1 DNA sequences are extremely repetitive and highly represented in constitutive heterochromatin. The LUC loci were relatively devoid of Cot-1 signal, whereas the flanking regions were intensely highlighted (Fig. 3 B). Similar evidence that the MMTV-LUC loci differ distinctly from the flanking chromosomal domains is revealed by GTG banding and DAPI staining. The MMTV-LUC loci corresponded to light G bands flanked by distinctive, dark G bands (Fig. 3 E). DAPI staining exhibited a similar pattern whereby the LUC loci were flanked by bright DAPI bands (Fig. 3 C). The exclusion of luciferase from the Cot-1 and DAPI staining chromosomal domains is evidenced in Fig. 3 D, in which the luciferase, Cot-1, and DAPI signals are overlaid. DAPI has affinity for AT-rich regions of DNA, and dark G-bands are also rich in AT sequences, poor in coding sequences, and rich in L1 type interspersed repeats (23Gardiner K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Summarized schematically in Fig. 3 F, the presence of distinctive, defined chromosomal domains flanking each of the MMTV-LUC loci suggest that chromatin structure contributes to the novel, locus-specific, selective regulation of the MMTV promoter. Additional evidence that the integration sites of MMTV-LUC and MMTV-CAT endow the promoter with functionally distinct properties comes from experiments in which we used inhibitors of histone deacetylation. Histone acetylation modifies chromatin architecture, and histone acetyltransferases have been demonstrated to interact with nuclear receptors and to serve as transcriptional coactivators (24Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 25Nagy L.

Treatment of T47D(C&L) cells with the deacetylase inhibitor butyrate led to a dose-dependent increase in histone acetylation (Fig. 4 A). At all doses, butyrate dramatically potentiated the glucocorticoid induction of luciferase (Fig. 4 B). While butyrate did not lead to restoration of progesterone induction of luciferase to levels comparable with that seen with glucocorticoid activation, the small induction seen with progestins was also potentiated by butyrate (note scale difference, Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the hormonal induction of MMTV-CAT in the same cells was inhibited at all doses of butyrate (Fig. 4 C). Hormone-induced chromatin remodeling of the MMTV-LUC promoter was unchanged or enhanced following butyrate (Fig. 2 B) at the same time butyrate consistently suppressed remodeling at the MMTV-CAT promoter (Fig. 2 C). A differential action upon the hormone induction of the MMTV-LUC and MMTV-CAT genes was also seen with the more specific deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Trichostatin A potentiated hormone induction of MMTV-LUC activity much like butyrate but had little effect on induction of MMTV-CAT (data not shown). Thus, while a differential effect is still observed with trichostatin A, the data suggest that the butyrate inhibition of CAT induction may be through mechanisms other than deacetylase inhibition or involve deacetylases not inhibited by trichostatin A. These data confirm that the activity of the MMTV promoter can be regulated in a very distinct manner at different chromosomal locations. Moreover, these data provide a likely basis to account for the conflicting findings regarding the effect of butyrate on hormone responsiveness of MMTV (28Bartsch J. Truss M. Bode J. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10741-10746Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Bresnick E. John S. Berard D.S. Lefebvre P. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Specificity is a central question in the regulation of gene expression. Within a family, transcription factors expressed in the same cell can have identical DNA sequence recognition properties yet distinct activities. For example, GR and PR are both expressed in mammary epithelial cells, but the two hormones have very different effects. The mechanisms by which such specificity is generated are not well understood. In this report, we have presented evidence for a novel mechanism that confers specificity so that a promiscuously hormone responsive promoter is enabled to respond selectively to one of the two receptors. The MMTV promoter has been widely used as a model system for studying the role of chromatin structure in the regulation of gene expression by steroid hormone receptors. In stable chromatin, the MMTV LTR directs the assembly of an ordered nucleosome array (9Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 10Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The target sites for steroid receptor binding lie within the region occupied by nucleosome B, and this nucleosome is remodeled upon activation of the MMTV promoter by hormones. This is evidenced by an increased accessibility of the chromatinized DNA to cleavage by restriction enzyme digestion and increased loading of basal factors (9Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 10Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J.G. Beato M.

Beginning with the demonstration that the activity of GR expressed in yeast requires the SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex (17Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), subsequent work has supported a role for chromatin remodeling in steroid hormone action (18Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 19Khavari P.A. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 20Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 21Ostlund Farrants A-K. Blomquist P. Kwon H. Wrange O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recently evidence has been presented for a direct interaction of GR with the human SWI-SNF homolog, BRG1 (30Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Activation of the MMTV promoter is also accompanied by a partial depletion of histone H1 from the template in vivo (31Bresnick E.H. Rories C. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids and progestins can induce many of the same promoters including MMTV. This is not surprising, since the DNA binding domains of GR and PR have very high sequence identity (32Miesfeld R.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and target sequence utilization (33Lieberman B.A. Bona B.J. Edwards D.P. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Nordeen S.K. Suh B.J. Kühnel B. Hutchison III, C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, the question of how these two transcriptional activators can generate specific responses in tissues where both may be expressed is an important issue. We previously made the surprising observation that in T47D(A1–2) cells engineered to express comparable levels of GR and PR, a stably integrated MMTV-luciferase template can be induced by glucocorticoids but is almost completely refractory to progestins. Unlike glucocorticoids, progestins fail to initiate remodeling of the MMTV promoter (12Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we explored the unique possibility that the MMTV integration site determines the ability of the PR to remodel MMTV chromatin and activate transcription. Our approach involved the stable introduction of an additional MMTV-driven reporter gene (MMTV-CAT) into T47D(A1–2) cells. We then examined the induction of this reporter in response to treatment with glucocorticoids and progestins. In contrast to the differential induction of MMTV-LUC, a robust induction of MMTV-CAT was observed after treatment with either the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone or the synthetic progestin R5020. Because the MMTV LTR sequences used in the construction of MMTV-LUC and MMTV-CAT are the same, the observed differential capacity of PR to induce transcription from MMTV-LUC and MMTV-CAT cannot be attributed to differences in MMTV promoter sequences. Additionally, the full complement of factors required for PR activation appears to be present in T47D(C&L) cells as evidenced by PR-mediated induction of MMTV-CAT or the endogenous ALP gene. The specific characteristics of these chromosomal domains, which either allow or prevent PR from activating MMTV, remains unknown. Efforts are currently under way to explore the nature of these MMTV integration sites and their role in the differential activation of MMTV by steroid hormone receptors. Previously, it has been reported that histone acetylation can have either inhibitory or stimulatory effects on MMTV promoter activity, depending on the experimental system. Hager and colleagues (29Bresnick E. John S. Berard D.S. Lefebvre P. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) reported that the histone deacetylase inhibitor butyrate inhibits GR activation of MMTV by blocking remodeling of nucleosome B. Beato and colleagues (28Bartsch J. Truss M. Bode J. Beato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10741-10746Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have shown that the response of the MMTV promoter can be modulated by the degree of histone acetylation; moderate histone acetylation led to activation of MMTV, while high levels of histone acetylation led to a reduction of MMTV activity. In this paper, we show that increased histone acetylation is interpreted very differently at different chromosomal sites. At one, the hormonal induction of MMTV promoter activity is potentiated, whereas at another it is inhibited or unaffected. These results suggest a mechanism, perhaps a specific chromatin architecture at the integration site, that can impose selectivity on a promiscuously responsive promoter. The ramifications of this suggestion are of enormous importance, implying that such chromosomal regulatory domains are a critical determinant of tissue and hormone specificity of gene responsiveness. Such mechanisms could also play important roles in development and homeostasis by enforcing specificity of action among members of transcription factor families that have similar DNA recognition properties. There are many examples where chromatin architecture has been implicated in determining whether a gene is expressed. Notable examples under active investigation include position effect variegation in Drosophila and gene silencing near telomeres in yeast. Although mammalian examples are less tractable experimentally, certainly X chromosome inactivation and parental imprinting have received considerable attention. The results of the present work imply that controls more subtle than a simple on or off decision are at work, identifying a novel mechanism for differential regulation of gene expression. It will be important to identify additional examples. One possibility is the recent report of a stably transfected MMTV-CAT gene inducible by glucocorticoids but refractory to mineralocorticoids (15Bonovich M.T. List H.J. Zhang S. Danielsen M. Riegel A.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Chromatin architecture may also influence the modulation of steroid-mediated induction by cellular signal transduction pathways. The hormonal activation of the MMTV promoter has been reported to be potentiated by cAMP in transient chromatin but inhibited in stable chromatin (35Pennie W.D. Hager G.L. Smith C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, inhibition is not a universal finding. Both GR and PR action on stably integrated MMTV promoters can be potentiated in fibroblasts and mammary carcinoma cell lines, including T47D(A1–2) (36Nordeen S.K. Moyer M.L. Bona B.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although it is difficult to compare results between different cell lines, these data may suggest that the response of the steroid induction to cAMP elevation may differ at different chromosomal locations. Together with the present data, these findings provide support for the concept of chromatin architecture imposing constraints that can confer differential transcriptional responses.

Both DGL and ConA bind with high affinity to the “core” trimannoside moiety, 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside, which is present in asparagine-linked carbohydrates. Recent hemagglutination inhibition studies suggest that DGL and ConA recognize similar epitopes of the trisaccharide but possess different binding specificities for complex carbohydrates (Gupta, D., Oscarson, S., Raju, T. S., Stanley, P., Toone, E. J., and Brewer, C. F. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 242, 320–326). In the present study, we have used isothermal titration microcalorimetry to determine the thermodynamics of binding of DGL to a complete set of monodeoxy analogs of the core trimannoside as well as a tetradeoxy analog. The thermodynamic data indicate that DGL recognizes the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of the α(1,6) Man residue, the 3- and 4-hydroxyl group of the α(1, 3) Man residue, and the 2- and 4-hydroxyl groups of the central Man residue of the trimannoside. The thermodynamic data for the tetradeoxy analog lacking the 3- and 4-hydroxyl group of the α(1, 3) Man residue, and the 2- and 4-hydroxyl groups of the central Man residue of the trimannoside are consistent with the involvement of these hydroxyl groups in binding. While the overall pattern of data for DGL binding to the deoxy analogs is similar to that for ConA (Gupta, D., Dam, T. K., Oscarson, S., and Brewer, C. F. (1997)J. Biol.

The seed lectin from Dioclea grandiflora(DGL)1 is a Man/Glc-binding protein obtained from northeast Brazil and is a member of a large group of lectins from the subtribe Diocleinae. DGL is devoid of covalently linked carbohydrate and is reported to be a tetramer with a molecular mass of 100,000 Da (1Moreira R.A. Barros A.C.H. Stewart J.C. Pusztai A. Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As with other legume lectins, DGL requires Ca2+ and a transition metal ion for its binding activity. The lectin possesses a high degree of sequence homology with the jack bean lectin, concanavalin A (ConA), another member of the Diocleinae subtribe, differing in 52 out of 237 residues (2Richardson M.

Six of the seven residues that have been implicated as ligands for the Ca2+and transition metal ion sites are conserved, and the seven amino acid residues surrounding the carbohydrate binding site of ConA are also conserved in DGL (2Richardson M.

In order to gain insight into the detailed binding specificities of DGL and ConA, a series of mono and dideoxy derivatives (2–14) of methyl 3,6-di-O-(α-mannopyranosyl)-α-mannopyranoside (1) (Fig. 1) were synthesized and tested for their ability to bind to both lectins as determined by hemagglutination inhibition methods (3Gupta D.

(Northampton, MA). In individual titrations, injections of 4 μl of carbohydrate were added from the computer-controlled 250-μl microsyringe at an interval of 4 min into the lectin solution (cell volume = 1.3424 ml) dissolved in the same buffer as the saccharide, while stirring at 350 rpm. An example of an ITC experiment is shown in Fig. 2 for deoxy analog4 with DGL at 27 °C. Control experiments performed by making identical injections of saccharide into a cell-containing buffer with no protein showed insignificant heats of dilution. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal, with ΔH (enthalpy change in kcal mol−1), K a (association constant inm−1), and n (number of binding sites/monomer) as adjustable parameters. The quantity c= K a M t(0), whereM t(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration microcalorimetry (14Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandt J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal.

DGL is devoid of covalently linked carbohydrate and is reported to be a tetramer with a molecular mass of 100,000 Da (1Moreira R.A. Barros A.C.H. Stewart J.C. Pusztai A. Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As with other legume lectins, DGL requires Ca2+ and a transition metal ion for its binding activity. The lectin possesses a high degree of sequence homology with the jack bean lectin, concanavalin A (ConA), another member of the Diocleinae subtribe, differing in 52 out of 237 residues (2Richardson M. Campos F.D.A.P. Moreira R.A. Ainouz I.L. Begbie R. Watt W.B. Pusztai A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Six of the seven residues that have been implicated as ligands for the Ca2+and transition metal ion sites are conserved, and the seven amino acid residues surrounding the carbohydrate binding site of ConA are also conserved in DGL (2Richardson M. Campos F.D.A.P. Moreira R.A. Ainouz I.L. Begbie R. Watt W.B. Pusztai A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Despite similarities in the relatively conserved structures of the two lectins and their similar Man/Glc binding specificities, DGL and ConA possess differences in their binding specificities for largerN-linked carbohydrates including complex carbohydrate16 (Fig. 1) (3Gupta D. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both ConA and DGL possess different biological activities such as histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (4Gomes J.C. Rossi R.R. Cavada B.S. Moreira R.A. Oliveira J.T.A. Agents Actions. 1994; 41: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to investigate the detailed carbohydrate binding specificity of DGL in order to understand the molecular basis for its biological activities relative to other members of the Diocleinae subtribe including ConA. DGL and ConA, like other members of the Diocleinae subtribe (5Dam T.K. Cavada B.S. Grangeiro T.B. Santos C.F. de Sousa F.A.M. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol.

In order to gain insight into the detailed binding specificities of DGL and ConA, a series of mono and dideoxy derivatives (2–14) of methyl 3,6-di-O-(α-mannopyranosyl)-α-mannopyranoside (1) (Fig. 1) were synthesized and tested for their ability to bind to both lectins as determined by hemagglutination inhibition methods (3Gupta D.

The results suggest that both ConA and DGL have similar extended binding sites that recognize the same epitopes of the trimannoside. In the present study, isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) is used to determine the thermodynamics of DGL binding to monodeoxy analogs 2–11 and tetradeoxy analog 15, as well as biantennary complex carbohydrate 16 (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2035871112,"Abstract It has been proposed that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)-activating protein (FLAP) is an arachidonate transfer protein for leukotriene biosynthesis. Using the Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells, we demonstrate that FLAP causes a large stimulation (190-fold) of the conversion of 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) to 5,12-diHETE when co-expressed with 5-lipoxygenase. We also demonstrate that FLAP can stimulate (2–2.5-fold) the oxygenation of 15(S)-HETE by 5-LO to 5,15-diHETE. The stimulation of both 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE oxygenation by 5-LO is completely inhibitable by the FLAP inhibitor, MK-886. In order to determine which residues of FLAP are important for 12(S)-HETE and arachidonic acid utilization by 5-LO, various mutants of FLAP were co-expressed with 5-LO in Sf9 cells. The FLAP deletion mutants del 37–53, del 52–58, del 106–108, and del 148–161 and the point mutant D62N were analyzed. The D62N mutation, which reduces the binding of indole inhibitors to FLAP, had no effect on the stimulation of substrate utilization by 5-LO. In contrast to wild type FLAP, the mutant proteins del 37–53, del 106–108, and del 148–161 failed to stimulate 12(S)-HETE and arachidonic acid utilization by 5-LO. Only one of the latter three mutations (del 37–53) has been shown to abolish the binding of indole inhibitors to FLAP. These results suggest that the lipid binding site of FLAP overlaps the inhibitor binding site and occupies several regions of the protein not essential for inhibitor binding. Because FLAP can stimulate the utilization of 12(S)-HETE, 15(S)-HETE, and arachidonic acid by 5-LO, FLAP may also function as a more general lipid carrier protein for the biosynthesis of multiple oxygenation products of arachidonic acid in addition to its role in leukotriene biosynthesis."

[14C]N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) binding to these cysteine mutants in isolated membranes was then investigated. The peptide chain of this region passes through the membrane at least once because residues 36 and 65 are exposed on the outside and inside surfaces of the membrane, respectively (Kimura, T., Ohnuma, M., Sawai, T., and Yamaguchi, A.

The proportion of the unbound positions in the second half downstream from position 45 was 55% (10/18), which was clearly higher than that in the first half (21%; 3/14), suggesting that the second half is a transmembrane segment. Positions reactive to NEM appear periodically in the second half. They are located on one side of the helical wheel, suggesting that this side of the transmembrane helix faces a water-filled channel. The cysteine mutants as to the reactive positions in the second half were severely inactivated by NEM except for the P59C mutant, whereas the A40C mutant was the only one inactivated by NEM in the first half.

Science. 1986; 233: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 7Allard J.D. Bertrand K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17809-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We established a new method for determining the membrane topology on the basis of the reactivity of SH reagents to cysteine-scanning mutants of the tetracycline/H+ antiporter (Fig. 1) (8Kimura T.

Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of intrinsic membrane proteins, especially lactose permease, has been widely used for site-directed chemical modification analysis (9Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found that Tet(B) has some segments composed of about 20 consecutive residues at which cysteine-scanning mutants were hardly reactive with NEM1 (22Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These segments are embedded in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. On the basis of this finding, we succeeded in determining the precise boundaries of transmembrane segment (TM) III (23Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and TM IX (22Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for the second transmembrane segment of EmrE. 2S. Schuldiner, personal communication. 2S. Schuldiner, personal communication. However, these observations were inconsistent with the results for lactose permease (10Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R.

A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), of which some cysteine mutants as to the putative transmembrane regions were inactivated by NEM orp-chloromercuribenzoate, indicating that these transmembrane cysteine residues are reactive with SH reagents. Therefore, in order to determine whether or not the NEM-reactive positions are also present in the transmembrane region of the Tet(B) protein, we constructed further cysteine-scanning mutants as to putative TM II. The first cytoplasmic loop region, loop2–3, contains a widely conserved motif, GXXXDRXGRR (4Henderson P.J.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 525-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The first and eighth Gly, fifth Asp, and ninth Arg were revealed to be important for the tetracycline transport function or maintenance of the protein conformation (24Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated second-site suppressor mutants of the G62L, D66C, and R70A mutants (25Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Yamaguchi A. Inagaki Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11800-11806Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Someya Y. Yamaguchi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1322: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The second-site mutations of the former two mutants (G62L and D66C) occurred in the first periplasmic loop region, loop1–2 (25Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 26Yamaguchi A. Inagaki Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11800-11806Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mutation at Gly-62 had a remote-conformational effect on loop1–2 via TM II (25Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tyr-50 and Gln-54 at mid-transmembrane positions of TM II, which are conserved in the tetracycline/H+ antiporters of Gram-negative bacteria, play some role in the substrate recognition (28Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Kimura T. Sakai T. Adachi Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5698-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, TM II may play a role in the substrate transport function. In this study, cysteine-scanning mutants of TM II and its flanking regions were constructed and analyzed. N-[ethyl-1-14C]Maleimide (1.5 GBq/mmol) and [7-3H]tetracycline (3.7 GBq/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other materials were of reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Cysteine-scanning mutants except for the L46C one were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel (29Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides. For the mutagenesis, plasmid pCT1183 (30Someya Y. Niwa A. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used as a template that carries the 2.45-kilobase pair Tn10 tetA and tetR gene fragments. The L46C mutant was constructed by the oligonucleotide-directed dual amber method (31Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Mizuno T. Ogasahara Y. Nakagawa M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using Mutan®-Super Express Km (Takara-shuzo Co., Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid pKFB3, which includes the tetR region and the first half of the tetA(B) region inserted into the multi-cloning site of pKF18k, was used for the oligonucleotide-directed dual amber method. All of the mutations were detected as the appearance of a newly introduced restriction site and then verified by DNA sequencing. Low copy number mutant plasmids were constructed through exchange of the BglII-EcoRV fragment for E32C to E37C, theBglII-EcoRI fragment for D38C to A40C, or theEcoRV-EcoRI fragment for N41C to L61C of the cysteine-scanning mutant tetA(B) genes with the corresponding fragment of the low copy number plasmid, pLGC377A, which encodes a cysteine-less mutant Tet(B) (22Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and then used fortetA(B) gene expression. Tetracycline resistance was determined by the two-fold agar dilution method as described previously (32Yamaguchi A. Ono N. Akasaka T. Noumi T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15525-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration. The [14C]NEM-binding experiment was performed as described previously (33Kimura T. Nakatani M. Kawabe T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5475-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Everted membrane vesicles were prepared fromEscherichia coli W3104 cells carrying pLGC377A or one of its derivatives, and tetracycline transport assay was performed as described previously (34Yamaguchi A. Samejima T. Kimura T. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4359-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cysteine-scanning mutants as to the putative TM II segment and its flanking regions were constructed in order to identify functional residues and to precisely determine the topology around TM II of Tet(B). TM II was determined to be present between Ser-36 and Gly-62 because these residues are located on the outside and inside surfaces of the membrane, respectively (8Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,25Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We introduced cysteine mutations at positions 29, 30, 31, and 36, and from 62 to 103 in our previous study (8Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol.

The remaining positions around TM II and its flanking hydrophilic regions,i.e. positions from 32 to 35 and from 37 to 61, were mutagenized in this study. The C377A mutant was used as a template, which is a Cys-less mutant retaining full activity comparable to that of the wild-type (22Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and then transferred to the low copy number plasmid, pLGC377A, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression levels of the mutant tetA(B) genes were determined by Western blotting using anti-Tet(B) C-terminal peptide antiserum (35Yamaguchi A. Adachi K. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 17-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The amount of each mutant Tet(B) protein was comparable to that of the wild-type in the membrane fraction of E. coliW3104 cells (data not shown). The tetracycline resistance levels of E. coli cells including these mutants were measured by the agar dilution method (Table I). None of them lost the resistance, indicating that these amino acid residues of this region are not directly involved in the mechanism of tetracycline transport. These results also indicate that the replacement of the residues in this region did not cause a drastic conformational change. Only the G44C mutant showed a reduction to a moderate resistance level. The tetracycline transport activity of the G44C mutant in everted membrane vesicles was greatly reduced (Fig. 2 A). Gly-44 may be important for maintenance of the local conformation as in the cases reported previously (24Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yamaguchi A. Kimura T. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The resistance levels are indicated as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined by the agar dilution method. As to Y50C and Q54C, the tetracycline transport activities were quite low as shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), whereas the drug resistance were not largely decreased. We reported that Tyr-50 and Gln-54 were involved in the tetracycline transport function because all substitution mutants of these residues showed largely reduced activity (28Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Kimura T. Sakai T. Adachi Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5698-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Out of the mutants reported in the previous paper (28Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Kimura T. Sakai T. Adachi Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5698-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the data as to Y50C mutant, which showed no transport activity, were incorrect. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Y50C showed very low but significant tetracycline transport activity, which was highly reproducible. Although the reason for the discrepancy between the drug resistance and the transport activity is not clear, the drug resistance seems to be saturated at relatively low tetracycline efflux activity if any other characteristics of the transporter are not altered. Thus, it seems likely that Tyr-50 and Gln-54 play some roles in tetracycline transport function. Similar to Y50C and Q54C, the P59C mutant also showed the greatly reduced transport activity without apparent change in the drug resistance (Fig. 2 D). We consider that Pro-59 is also involved in the transport function through maintaining the local protein conformation because the reduced transport activity of P59C mutant was recovered by modification with NEM (Fig. 5). The binding of [14C]NEM to Cys-scanning mutants R31C to G62C was examined (Fig. 3). The reactivity of the I34C, F37C, I39C, V45C, A48C, L49C, L52C, M53C, V55C, I56C, F57C, W60C, and L61C mutants with NEM was very low. The other Cys mutants showed high reactivity with NEM (Fig. 3). There was no segment in which there were more than four consecutive low reactive positions. When this region was separated into two segments at the boundary after position 44, the frequencies of low reactive positions in the first and second segments were 21% (3 of 14) and 55% (10 of 18), respectively. This indicates that the second segment is located in a more hydrophobic environment than the first one. The peptide chain of this region must pass through the membrane, because positions 36 and 62 are located on the outside and inside surfaces of the membrane, respectively (8Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Kimura T. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the second half is a transmembrane segment. Positions reactive with [14C]NEM appeared periodically in the putative TM II. When the residues of TM II were projected as a helical wheel, these positions were found to be located on one side of the wheel (Fig. 4), suggesting that this side of TM II faces a hydrophilic environment. The chemical reaction of a maleimide derivative with a sulfhydryl group is a nucleophilic attack in which the active molecular species of a sulfhydryl group is a deprotonated form. Since deprotonation of an SH group required a water molecule as a proton acceptor, these results strongly suggest the existence of a water-filled transmembrane channel. Tyr-50 and Gln-54, which are predicted to be involved in substrate recognition (28Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Kimura T. Sakai T. Adachi Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5698-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), are located on the hydrophilic side of the amphiphilic α-helix and cysteine mutants of them are highly reactive to NEM (Fig. 3). This observation also supports the idea that TM II faces the substrate translocation pathway. For the Cys mutants reactive to NEM, the effect of NEM on the tetracycline transport activity was measured in everted membrane vesicles. In our previous study, it was revealed that an excess (5 mm) of NEM does not affect the transport activity of Cys mutants, which exhibit very low reactivity with NEM (23Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of NEM on the low-reactive Cys mutants was not examined in this study. The results for Cys mutants R31C to M64C are shown in Fig. 5. The G44C mutant was not examined because it retained only very little transport activity (Fig. 2 A). In the putative transmembrane region (TM II; Val-45 to Leu-61), the Y50C, Q54C, and A58C mutants were completely inactivated by NEM. The L46C and A51C mutants were greatly inactivated. The L47C mutant was inhibited about 50% under these conditions (Fig. 4). As to the L46C, L47C, and A51C mutants, the inhibition levels were measured with a higher concentration (5 mm) of NEM. As a result, the inhibition levels were increased (90, 60, and 100% inhibition, respectively). In contrast, only the P59C mutant was activated by NEM more than 2-fold. In summary, all of the NEM-reactive mutants as to TM II were inactivated except for the P59C mutant. On the other hand, in the putative periplasmic segment between Arg-31 and Phe-43, the A40C mutant was a unique one, which was greatly inactivated by NEM (80% inhibition). Such unique hot spots for NEM inhibition were also found in other hydrophilic loop regions, loop2–3 (24Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), loop3–4 (23Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and loop8–9 (37Yamaguchi A. Kimura T. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6496-6504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition pattern of the putative TM II was clearly different from those of the loop regions. Positions 46, 47, 50, 51, 54, and 58 face to the putative water-filled transmembrane channel (Fig. 4). It seems likely that the tetracycline transport was sterically inhibited by NEM bound to the Cys residues on this side of TM II, suggesting that the channel is a substrate translocation pathway. Pro-59 is located on the hydrophobic side of TM II (Fig. 4). The tetracycline transport activity of the P59C mutant was reduced to 25% of that of the wild type (Fig. 2 B). Thus the activity of the NEM-modified P59C mutant was nearer that of the wild-type than that of the unmodified one, probably reflecting the fact that the maleimidyl side chain fitted the local conformation more than the free SH group. The kink in the peptide backbone at Pro-59 may play a role in the maintenance of the conformation of TM II. Previously, we showed that cysteine-scanning mutants as to transmembrane segments III (23Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and IX (22Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were not reactive with NEM. We established the precise boundaries of these segments and confirmed the whole topology of Tet(B) by means of the reactivity of the mutants with sulfhydryl reagents (22Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the reactivity of Cys-scanning mutants of Tet(B), R31C to G62C. Although the peptide chain of this region must pass across the membrane, no continuous segment was found in which all residues exhibited no reactivity with NEM, such as TM III and TM IX. Since the hydrophobicity of the latter half of the region between positions 31 and 62 is higher than that of the former region, TM II seems to be located between Val-45 and Leu-61. In this putative TM II, highly reactive positions appeared periodically. Moreover, the highly reactive positions were located on one side of the helical wheel. This latter half contains Tyr-50 and Gln-54, which are predicted to play some role in substrate recognition (28Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Kimura T. Sakai T. Adachi Y. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5698-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Cys mutants as to these positions are highly reactive with NEM, suggesting that the hydrophilic side of TM II faces the water-filled substrate translocation channel. Several cysteine mutants as to the putative transmembrane segment of lactose permease (LacY) or glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate exchanger (UhpT) were shown to be inactivated by sulfhydryl reagents (9Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R.

These results indicate the possibility that NEM binds to the Cys residues facing the transmembrane aqueous channel, which probably comprises the substrate translocation pathway. This was not the case for TM III and TM IX of the tetracycline/H+ antiporter, indicating that the environments of these helices are very hydrophobic. In order to determine whether or not Tet(B) has such a transmembrane aqueous channel, we investigated cysteine-scanning mutants as to TM II in this study. The results of TM II Cys-scanning mutagenesis supported the notion for LacY and UhpT described above. Searching for such inactivated positions by use of sulfhydryl reagents is useful for determining the accessibility of NEM to a Cys residue; however, there remains the possibility that a Cys residue is modified but not inactivated. Therefore, it is necessary to directly assay NEM reactivity with Cys residues. As for TM II of Tet(B), almost all of the NEM-accessible mutants were inactivated by NEM. This observation was very different from in the case of modification of Cys-scanning mutants as to the hydrophilic loop regions (23Kimura T. Shiina Y. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5243-5247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Yamaguchi A. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19155-19162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yamaguchi A. Kimura T. Someya Y. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6496-6504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the loop regions, most Cys residues are modified by NEM but not inactivated. Only a few positions are sensitive to NEM modification, which we called hot spots in our previous paper. In this study, Ala-40 was found to be such a hot spot in periplasmic loop1–2. Although the current data suggest the presence of the transmembrane water-filled channel, the channel should not be continuous throughout the membrane because, if it is continuous, the proton permeability will be quite high and the protein acts as an uncoupler. Yan and Maloney (9Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported that, in UhpT, there are three kinds of transmembrane positions to which chloromercuribenzenesulfonate is accessible from the inside, the outside, and both sides, respectively. Since NEM is a membrane-permeable SH reagent, it can bind from both sides of the membrane vesicle. The interception of the water-filled channel is likely to be less than 10 Å, which may not be detected by this method. An alternative possibility is that an immobilized water is present on the putative substrate translocation pathway and plays as a proton acceptor without increasing the proton conductance. TM III and TM IX contain functional residues, Asp-84 and Asp-285, at the mid-transmembrane positions, respectively. These Asp residues were predicted to play a role for substrate and/or H+ binding (36Yamaguchi A. Akasaka T. Ono N. Someya Y. Nakatani M. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7490-7498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kimura T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was shown that TM III and TM IX are very hydrophobic, as judged by the NEM reactivity of the Cys-scanning mutants, so that these helices are not likely to compose the water-filled channel. Rather, it is likely that these two aspartic residues face toward the hydrophobic interior of the membrane in the resting state and that they may interact with the substrate or proton in the course of turnover. If the water-filled channel is completely parallel to TM II, NEM-reactive positions should appear at every 3.6 residues. The highly reactive positions of TM II were 46, 50, 54, and 58, which is every 4 residues. This may suggest that TM II is tilted as to the water-filled channel (Fig. 6). The substrate may be translocated along the tilted helix from the cytoplasm to the periplasm over the residues at positions 58, 54, 50, and 46."

The enzyme requires the basic amino acid residues in the extension peptides for effective and specific cleavage. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the molecular recognition of substrate by the enzyme, several glutamates around the active site of the rat β-subunit, which has a putative metal-binding motif, H56 XXEH60, were mutated to alanines or aspartates, and effects on kinetic parameters, metal binding, and substrate binding of the enzyme were analyzed. None of mutant proteins analyzed was impaired in dimer formation with the α-subunit. Mutation of glutamates at positions 79, 129, and 136, in addition to an active-site glutamate at position 59, resulted in a marked decrease in cleavage efficiency. Together with sequence alignment data, glutamate 136 appears to be involved in metal binding. Glutamate 129 is mostly responsible for the catalysis, as there was a considerable decrease in k cat value by the mutation. Mutation of glutamate 79 led to decrease in k cat value and increase in K m values. Substrate binding experiments using an environmentally sensitive fluorescence probe attached to the peptide showed that the mutation caused a remarkable environmental change at the binding site to the N-terminal region of the substrate peptide and decreased binding of the peptide, thereby suggesting that glutamate 79 participates primarily in substrate binding.

Most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as larger precursors with N-terminal extension peptides for targeting into mitochondria (1Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N.

During or after import of the precursors into mitochondria, the extension peptides are proteolytically removed by three types of processing peptidases. Mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP1; EC 3.4.24.64) (4Sagara Y. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Schmit B. Wachter E. Sebald W.

Experientia. 1996; 52: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) generally cleaves off a large part of the extension peptide, including the mitochondrial matrix-targeting sequence as the initial step of the processing. Many precursors are converted into the mature forms by the one-step processing. The second enzyme is mitochondrial intermediate peptidase, which catalyzes second-step cleavage in the two-step processing of some precursor proteins (9Kalousek F. Isaya G. Rosenberg L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Kalousek F. Hendrick J.P. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7536-7540Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These precursors are first cleaved by MPP, and then the residual octapeptides are removed by the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase. The last enzyme is inner membrane protease I, which processes the signal sequence for inner membrane and intermembrane space (11Schneider A. Oppliger W. Jeno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8635-8638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The last two peptidases sequentially act after cleavage of the matrix targeting sequences by MPP. Thus, MPP plays an important role in proteolytical processing of precursors in mitochondria.MPP has been purified from mitochondria of Neurospora crassa(12Hawlitschek G. Schneider H. Schmidt B. Tropschug M. Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Cell. 1988; 53: 795-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13Yang M. Jensen R.E. Yaffe M.P. Opplinger W. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3857-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), rat liver (14Ou W.-J. Ito A. Okazaki H. Omura T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and a few plants (15Eriksson A.C. Glaser E. Biochim. Biophys.

The enzymes, except for those of the plant, are soluble proteins in the mitochondrial matrix and consist of α and β subunits. The subunits from yeast and rat liver form a stable heterodimer, whereas Neurospora subunits could be separated from each other by gel filtration. Processing activity of the enzymes is sensitive to metal chelators, and the lost activity is restored by divalent metal ions (4Sagara Y. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Schmit B. Wachter E. Sebald W. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1884; 144: 581-588Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Miura S.

MPP specifically recognizes a large variety of mitochondrial precursor proteins and cleaves off the extension peptides at single sites (14Ou W.-J. Ito A. Okazaki H. Omura T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Contrary to the strict substrate specificity of the enzyme, amino acid sequences of the extension peptides are wide in length and poor in similarity (1Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Many experimental observations have indicated that basic amino acid residues in the extension peptides were required for the effective processing by MPP (17Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K.

MPP may well recognize some higher order structure of extension peptide with the basic amino acids.When primary structures of two subunits of MPP from yeast,Neurospora, rat, and potato were determined (12Hawlitschek G.

A. 1993; 90: 5355-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), each subunit proved to be highly homologous among organisms. The subunits of MPP also have significant sequence homology with a family of endopeptidases, the pitrilysin family (29Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Braun H.-P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), that includesEscherichia coli pitrilysin (also called protease III), the insulin-degrading enzymes from mammals and insects, theN-arginine dibasic convertase from rat. Despite metalloendopeptidases, they lack the thermolysin-like zinc binding motif HEXXH, but all the members except the α-MPPs have the inverted motif, HXXEH. Site-directed mutagenesis showed a zinc binding site in E. coli pitrilysin (31Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The α- and β-subunits of the MPP are also homologous to core proteins, core 2 and core 1, respectively, of mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochromec oxidoreductase (bc 1 complex), a component of the respiratory chain (32Rohlen D.A. Hoffmann J. van der Pas J.C. Nehls U. Preis D. Sackmann U. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In potato and spinach mitochondria, interestingly, two subunits are identical with the core proteins and are integrated into the bc 1complex (15Eriksson A.C. Glaser E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 208-214Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Braun H.-P. Emmermanm M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 9: 3219-3227Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Attempts to obtain each subunit by expression in E. colidemonstrated that each subunit alone had no activity. Thus, cooperative actions of the two subunits are essential for the processing activity (33Géli V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6247-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Arretz M. Schneider H. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9284-9288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation experiments at the putative metal binding site, His56-Xaa-Xaa-Glu59-His60 in the β-MPP, demonstrated that this subunit is a catalytic subunit (36Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, amino acid residues and regions in the β-MPP seem to be functionally important, as deduced from mutation studies (37Strieble H-M. Rysavy P. Adamec J. Spizek J. Kalousek F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Luciano P. Geoffroy S. Brandet A. Hernandez J-F. Géli V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).We have now identified amino acid residues involved in the enzyme function, and we attempted to elucidate mechanisms involved in molecular recognition of substrates by the enzyme. Several glutamates around the active site of the rat β-subunit were mutated to alanines or aspartates, and effects on kinetic parameters, metal binding, and substrate binding of the mutated enzymes were analyzed. We find that some glutamate residues are indeed essential for substrate binding and catalytic reaction.DISCUSSIONWe substituted seven glutamate residues in the N-terminal region of rat β-MPP in an attempt to identify residues involved in the enzyme function. Kinetic and subunit interaction analysis revealed that Glu-79, Glu-129, and Glu-136 were responsible for the enzymatic activity but not for subunit assembly.We have shown that two histidines and a glutamate in the HXXEH motif in the β subunit are essential for MPP activity, probably as a metal binding and catalytic site (36Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we clearly demonstrated direct and no participation of the two histidines and glutamate, respectively, in metal binding. The finding agrees with those in pitrilysin (31Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of HXXEH motif is highly conserved as the metal binding through the pitrilysin family. Based on sequence homology with other members of pitrilysin family, Glu-136 may be a candidate of the third metal binding site in the β subunit. Site-directed mutation experiments at Glu-136 clearly demonstrated that the mutation to either aspartate or alanine led to a complete loss of the activity. Alanine mutant at the Glu-136, however, contained low but significant amounts of the metal compared with the histidine mutants described above. Similar results were reported in the pitrilysin. Mutation at the Glu-169 in pitrilysin, which is a corresponding residue to Glu-136 in MPP and is proposed to the third metal binding site, also resulted in loss of the insulin-degrading activity but still retention of significant amount of the metal (41Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the proposed third metal binding site may have lower responsibility for metal coordination than the histidines in HXXEH motif. Physiochemical and structural analysis will be needed to elucidate the metal coordination state in the members of pitrilysin family.Because Glu-129 is completely conserved in the pitrilysin family, it may play another role in the catalysis of metalloendopeptidases, such as stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate in the proteolytic reaction. The mutation at the position in pitrilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme greatly reduced the total activities (41Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Perlman R.K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33140-33145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present kinetic analyses demonstrated that the glutamate seemed to be required for effective turnover but not for substrate binding. We cannot, however, completely exclude the possibility that the mutations affected conformation of the β-MPP. Indeed, mutation of the Glu-129 tended to decrease the protein stability in E. coli. Structure prediction of the protein tells us that mutation of the glutamate to alanine or aspartate leads to disruption of the α-helical structure around the segment that contains a putative metal binding residue, Glu-136. Thus, the mutation could influence the metal binding conformation, and consequently, the k catvalue of the mutant protein might decrease, without affecting subunit assembly and substrate binding.An acidic amino acid cluster characteristic of MPP among pitrilysin families, Glu-75, Glu-77, and Glu-79, is a possible candidate as a segment responsible for substrate recognition, because previous studies on structural features common to the substrates of MPP revealed that basic amino acids are essential for recognition of the substrates by the enzyme (16Braun H.-P. Emmermanm M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 9: 3219-3227Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 17Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutation of the glutamates demonstrated that Glu-79 is a key residue for effective cleavage of the substrates and that Glu-75 and Glu-77 do not seem to be essential for the activity. Binding affinity of the peptide to Glu-79 mutant was reduced to a similar extent between N- and C-terminal-labeled peptides. Interestingly, the fluorescence emission from an environment-sensitive probe attached to the N-terminal portion induced by interaction with the mutant MPP was markedly decreased, although little effect was observed on the emission with the C-terminal-labeled peptide. These findings suggest that mutation at Glu-79 causes a remarkable environmental change in the binding site for the N-terminal region of the substrate peptide, and that failure in correct interaction of the region of the peptide to MPP brings about impairment of leading and fixing the cleavage site of the peptide to the correct position in the active site of MPP; consequently, the rate of the cleavage reaction would be markedly decreased.The α- and β-subunits of the MPP are homologous to the core 2 and core 1 proteins of mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome coxidoreductase (bc1 complex), a component of the respiratory chain (30Braun H.-P. Schmitz U.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). the Crystal structure of thebc1 complex from bovine heart mitochondria has recently been reported (43Xia D., Yu, C-A. Kim H. Xia J-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Disenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), and one can expect that MPP is similar in structure to the complex. Although detailed data are not available, core 1 and core 2 proteins are structurally similar and consist of two domains of roughly equal size and almost identical folding topology. In dimer form, they form a crack leading to the internal cavity, the wall of which is lined with mostly hydrophilic amino acid residues. Considering that arginine residues in extension peptides are required for substrate recognition by the MPP (17Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Song M-C. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem.

(Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the substrate binding pocket of the MPP is likely to be rich in negatively charged amino acids. Thus, the functional glutamates and metal binding sites of the β-subunit are probably arranged in the crack or cavity.Because MPP recognizes several structural features in precursor proteins, including basic amino acid residues proximal and distal to the cleavage site and hydrophobic residue at position 1 (17Niidome T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the enzyme is likely to have multiple binding sites corresponding to these structural elements. It is most likely that the amino acids around the cleavage site interact with the β-subunit, because this subunit has the active-site metal and catalytic residue, Glu-59. On the other hand, Glu-79 seems to function either to interact directly with or to lead the basic amino acid residues in the extension peptide to the proper position of the β-subunit. Basic amino acid residues at the upper N-terminal region of the extension peptide may interact with the α-subunit since our recent results show that mutation in the α-subunit leads to a decrease in cleavage efficiency of precursors with a longer extension peptide (44Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25158-25163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the model, the flexible linker regions containing proline and glycine in the portion between proximal and distal arginines (40Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) seem to help fit the substrates to the binding sites of the MPP subunits. Thus, cooperative interactions at multiple sites strengthen substrate recognition and make it specific even if interaction at each site is not so strong in the binding of the substrates. The multiple-site recognition mechanism may make feasible strict specificity and high affinity to MPP for precursors, the structures of which have little in common. Most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as larger precursors with N-terminal extension peptides for targeting into mitochondria (1Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N.

During or after import of the precursors into mitochondria, the extension peptides are proteolytically removed by three types of processing peptidases. Mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP1; EC 3.4.24.64) (4Sagara Y. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Schmit B. Wachter E. Sebald W.

Many precursors are converted into the mature forms by the one-step processing. The second enzyme is mitochondrial intermediate peptidase, which catalyzes second-step cleavage in the two-step processing of some precursor proteins (9Kalousek F. Isaya G. Rosenberg L.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Kalousek F. Hendrick J.P. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7536-7540Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These precursors are first cleaved by MPP, and then the residual octapeptides are removed by the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase. The last enzyme is inner membrane protease I, which processes the signal sequence for inner membrane and intermembrane space (11Schneider A. Oppliger W. Jeno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8635-8638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The last two peptidases sequentially act after cleavage of the matrix targeting sequences by MPP. Thus, MPP plays an important role in proteolytical processing of precursors in mitochondria. MPP has been purified from mitochondria of Neurospora crassa(12Hawlitschek G. Schneider H. Schmidt B.

The enzymes, except for those of the plant, are soluble proteins in the mitochondrial matrix and consist of α and β subunits. The subunits from yeast and rat liver form a stable heterodimer, whereas Neurospora subunits could be separated from each other by gel filtration. Processing activity of the enzymes is sensitive to metal chelators, and the lost activity is restored by divalent metal ions (4Sagara Y. Ito A. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1743-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Schmit B. Wachter E. Sebald W. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1884; 144: 581-588Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Miura S.

MPP specifically recognizes a large variety of mitochondrial precursor proteins and cleaves off the extension peptides at single sites (14Ou W.-J. Ito A. Okazaki H. Omura T.

Contrary to the strict substrate specificity of the enzyme, amino acid sequences of the extension peptides are wide in length and poor in similarity (1Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar).

The mutants were expressed and secreted by transfected cells normally and had molecular weights and levels of glycosylation similar to wild type LCAT. The purified proteins (>98% purity) had almost indistinguishable structures and stabilities as determined by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Enzymatic activities and kinetic analysis of the pure enzyme forms showed that wild type LCAT and both mutants were reactive with the water-soluble substrate, p-nitrophenyl butyrate, indicating the presence of an intact core active site and catalytic triad. Both the T123I and N228K mutants had markedly depressed reactivity with reconstituted HDL (rHDL), but T123I retained activity with low density lipoprotein. To determine whether defective binding to rHDL was responsible for the low activity of both mutants with rHDL, the equilibrium binding constants were measured directly with isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methods. The results indicated that the affinities of the mutants for rHDL were only about 2-fold lower than the affinity of wild type LCAT (K d = 2.3 × 10−7m). Together, the activity and equilibrium binding results suggest that the T123I mutant is defective in activation by apolipoprotein A-I, and the N228K mutant has impaired binding of lipid substrate to the active site. In addition, the kinetic binding rate constants determined by the SPR method indicate that normal LCAT dissociates from rHDL, on average, after one catalytic cycle.

Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT)1 plays a key role in the extracellular transport and metabolism of cholesterol. By esterifying cholesterol on lipoproteins, particularly on high density lipoproteins (HDL), LCAT promotes cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells, storage of cholesterol esters in lipoproteins, and transport of cholesterol to the liver and steroidogenic tissues for excretion or re-utilization.Disruptions in the human LCAT gene result in one of two rare genetic disorders, familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) or fish-eye disease (FED). The biochemical and clinical phenotypes of carriers of FLD or FED are different. The first naturally occurring variant of LCAT associated with FLD was discovered by Norum and Gjone (1Norum K.R. Gjone E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1967; 20: 231-243Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar) in 1967, although the specific molecular defect in these patients was identified only in 1992 (2Skretting G. Blomhoff J.P. Solheim J. Prydz H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To date, around 40 different mutations have been described that result in either one of these disorders (3Kuivenhoven J.A. Pritchard H. Hill J. Frohlich J. Assmann G. Kastelein J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 191-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations associated with FED are localized to exons 1, 4, and 6, whereas the mutations resulting in FLD are dispersed throughout the LCAT gene (4Glomset J.A. Assmann G. Gjone E. Nurum K.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Fredrickson D.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1933-1951Google Scholar).FLD patients exhibit a wide variety of clinical symptoms that include massive corneal opacification, anemia, proteinuria, and renal disease (5Assmann G. von Eckardstein A. Funke H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1991; 2: 110-117Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These clinical manifestations are due to elevated cholesterol and phospholipid levels in the affected cells and tissues. FLD is generally not accompanied by atherosclerosis, although a few cases have been reported (4Glomset J.A. Assmann G. Gjone E. Nurum K.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Fredrickson D.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1933-1951Google Scholar). The biochemical characteristics of FLD include the virtual absence of plasma LCAT activity and severely reduced cholesterol ester and plasma LCAT concentrations (3Kuivenhoven J.A. Pritchard H. Hill J. Frohlich J. Assmann G. Kastelein J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 191-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, all classes of lipoproteins exhibit abnormal profiles, have altered morphologies, and contain high proportions of unesterified cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (PC). The concentration of HDL cholesterol is markedly reduced and is accompanied by an abnormal distribution of HDL subclasses (4Glomset J.A. Assmann G. Gjone E. Nurum K.R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Fredrickson D.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1933-1951Google Scholar).In FED patients, the only clinical signs are the dense age-dependent corneal opacification (3Kuivenhoven J.A. Pritchard H. Hill J. Frohlich J. Assmann G. Kastelein J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 191-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No other clinical symptoms are evident in FED. A distinguishing feature of this disorder is the presence of an apparently normal ability of LCAT to esterify cholesterol in plasma, resulting in a normal plasma cholesterol ester content. Other characteristics of FED include HDL deficiency and partial reduction in LCAT concentration (6Carlson L.A. Holmquist L. Acta Med. Scand. 1983; 213: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In vitro, LCAT from FED patients does not esterify cholesterol in HDL (α-migrating lipoproteins) but retains its ability to esterify cholesterol in LDL (α-migrating lipoproteins). In contrast, LCAT from FLD patients does not esterify cholesterol in any lipoproteins (7Klein H.-G. Lohse P. Duverger N. Albers J.J. Rader D.J. Zech L.A. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 49-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although not observed previously, Kuivenhoven et al. (3Kuivenhoven J.A. Pritchard H. Hill J. Frohlich J. Assmann G. Kastelein J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 191-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently reported that 7 out of 19 FED probands they followed suffered from premature coronary artery disease.The fact that two distinct biochemical phenotypes arise from mutations within the same gene strongly suggests the presence of multiple functional domains in LCAT. In order to assess the molecular basis of these naturally occurring mutants, several of these mutants have been reconstructed and expressed in mammalian cells (8Qu S. Fan H. Blanco-Vaca F. Pownall H.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 967-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Klein H.-G. Duverger N. Albers J.J. Marcovina S.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Biol.

Their results suggested that the functional domain mediating the phospholipase activity of LCAT was intact in these FLD and FED mutants but that possibly there was an alteration of structural regions involved in lipoprotein binding or in the trans-esterification reaction. Pownall and colleagues (8Qu S. Fan H. Blanco-Vaca F. Pownall H.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 967-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) expressed 11 FED or FLD constructs in COS-6 cells and found that FED mutants were more active with LDL than with HDL, whereas FLD mutants were, in general, less secretion-competent.These in vitro expression studies of the natural mutants of LCAT (2Skretting G.

They confirm the functional abnormalities observed for the natural mutants but do not provide additional insights into the structural domains of the enzyme that determine the functions nor the molecular mechanisms involved. In this study we describe the reconstruction, in vitro expression, purification, and characterization of two natural mutants, Thr-123 → Ile (T123I) and Asn-228 → Lys (N228K). These two variants were chosen based on their high expression levels and reported substrate specificities (9Klein H.-G. Duverger N. Albers J.J. Marcovina S.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9443-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The T123I mutant, which results in the FED phenotype, has been shown to esterify cholesterol on LDL but not on HDL (10O K. Hill J.S. Wang X. Pritchard H.P. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Funke H. von Eckardstein A. Pritchard H.P. Albers J.J. Kastelein J.J.P. Droste C. Assmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4855-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N228K is an FLD mutant that lacks activity with both HDL and LDL substrates (9Klein H.-G. Duverger N. Albers J.J.

Murayama N. Shimano H. Kozaki K. Albers J.J. Yazaki Y. Akanuma Y. Lancet. 1991; 338: 778-781Abstract PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These functional differences between the two mutants could be due to differences in binding to lipoprotein surfaces, altered activation by apolipoprotein A-I in HDL, or impaired binding of lipid substrate molecules at the active site of LCAT. In order to delineate the specific underlying causes of the defects, these mutants have been transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and, permanently, in CHO cells, and their enzymatic activity, structure, stability, and binding to lipoprotein surfaces have been investigated in detail. Two new methods to study directly the binding of LCAT to lipoproteins are introduced, isothermal titration calorimetry and the surface plasmon resonance method.RESULTSImmunoblots of concentrated cell media and intracellular contents of COS-1 cells, transfected with the pSVLCAT plasmid for wild type and the T123I and N228K mutants, are shown in Fig. 1. Clearly the levels of expression and secretion of the three forms of LCAT are very similar. Within cells, partially glycosylated proteins predominate, whereas in cell media the fully glycosylated proteins along with smaller amounts of unglycosylated forms are detected.The cell media were used to examine the enzymatic activities of the expressed wild type and mutant forms of LCAT (Fig. 2). Both mutants have very low (5–10%) activity with rHDL but normal activity with PNPB. The T123I mutant has almost normal activity with LDL (87%), whereas the N228K mutant exhibits very low activity with LDL. These observations are entirely consistent with the previous reports on the enzymatic properties of these mutants (8Qu S. Fan H. Blanco-Vaca F. Pownall H.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 967-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Klein H.-G. Duverger N. Albers J.J. Marcovina S.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Biol.

All three enzyme forms were secreted at levels of up to 15 μg/ml and gave yields of 6 mg of 98% pure proteins per liter of culture media. Fig. 3 shows the SDS-PAGE gel of the purified proteins. N-terminal sequencing results showed that the wild type LCAT and the T123I and N228K mutants all had the same N-terminal sequences as follows: about 60% starting at the normal LCAT start site (FWLL …), with the remainder starting at residue 6 of the full sequence (VLFP …). This was observed previously in our laboratory (22Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The origin of this micro-heterogeneity is not known; however, our previous studies demonstrated that it has no structural nor functional effects when compared with human plasma LCAT (22Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3SDS-PAGE (12.5%) of purified wild type LCAT (lane 2), T123I mutant LCAT (lane 3), and N228K mutant LCAT (lane 4).

The gel was silver-stained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The enzyme kinetics of the purified LCAT forms were studied with the two interfacial substrates, rHDL and LDL, and the water-soluble substrate, PNPB. In addition to the acyltransferase reaction rates, the phospholipase reaction rates were measured with rHDL substrates. The results, expressed as apparent K m and k cat parameters, are summarized in TableI. Although the parameters for the different reactions cannot be easily compared because of the different substrates that were used, comparison of the mutant reaction with the corresponding reaction of wild type LCAT provides useful information. The kinetic parameters for the acyltransferase reaction of wild type LCAT with rHDL agree reasonably well with published results (22Jin L. Lee Y.-P. Jonas A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutants had low activities with rHDL that precluded measurement of the acyltransferase reaction kinetics. The phospholipase reactions with rHDL were measured using much higher enzyme concentrations (20-fold higher than for the acyltransferase reaction). In this case, the N228K mutant gave measurable results, which indicated a decrease in k cat and an increase in apparentK m relative to wild type LCAT, giving rise to an overall reactivity (k cat/K m) of 12%. The reaction with LDL required 50-fold higher enzyme levels than the acyltransferase reaction with rHDL. The T123I mutant had slightly decreased k cat and a slightly increased apparent K m relative to the wild type, resulting in a 55% relative reactivity (k cat/K m). If theK m values are considered to be proportional to the equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of the enzyme to the lipoprotein surfaces, then the increases in measured apparentK m values for mutants suggest somewhat decreased binding affinities for the interfacial substrates. The esterase reaction with PNPB is comparable for the mutants of LCAT and the wild type form of the enzyme. The K m values are identical which indicates equal binding affinity of the PNPB molecule for the active site of all three enzyme forms, whereas the small decreases in the k cat for the mutants suggest a slightly decreased catalytic efficiency. The relative reactivities (k cat/K m) for the T123I and the N228K mutants are 81 and 57%, respectively, of the wild type enzyme. Nevertheless, it is evident that the active site architecture is preserved, to a large extent, in the LCAT mutants. Qualitatively, the relative reactivities of the mutants with respect to the wild type LCAT, calculated from thek cat/K m values in Table I, are similar to the relative activities shown in Fig. 2. The quantitative differences are due to the use of pure enzymes and to the precise determination of enzyme concentrations in the experiments reported in Table I.Table IKinetic parameters for the enzymatic reactions of the LCAT mutants and wild type LCAT with lipoprotein substrates and with PNPBLCATrHDL1-aWith rHDL substrates the measurements were made as a function of apoA-I concentrations.

Open table in a new tab The structural similarity of the three forms of LCAT is further demonstrated by the identical denaturation profiles, shown in Fig. 5. Free energy changes of denaturation (ΔGH2O), cooperativities (m), and concentrations of GdnHCl at half-denaturation, calculated from the data in Fig. 5, are recorded in Table II. These values are essentially the same for wild type LCAT and both mutants; they correspond to only marginally stable proteins that have low cooperativity in their unfolding behavior.Figure 5Denaturation profiles for wild type LCAT (○), T123I mutant LCAT (▵), and N228K mutant LCAT (■). The fraction unfolded was obtained from the wavelength of maximum fluorescence as a function of guanidine hydrochloride concentration [GdnHCl].

Fig. 6 shows the heat changes upon addition of rHDL to the three LCAT solutions and the resulting titration curves. Albeit incomplete, because of experimental limitations (due to low maximum attainable LCAT concentration and small heat changes), the ITC results show binding of wild type LCAT and the N228K mutant to rHDL and give the K d values recorded in Table III. Apparently, for the T123I mutant there is no binding under the conditions of the experiment. However, it should be noted that the enthalpy changes observed with this mutant are even smaller than those detected with the other two LCAT forms, thus binding of the T123I mutant may occur but is undetectable by the ITC method.Figure 6Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments for the binding of wild type LCAT (A), T123I mutant LCAT (B), and N228K (C) mutant LCAT to reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles.

Open table in a new tab In contrast to the ITC results, the SPR sensorgram, shown in Fig. 7, indicates binding of the T123I mutant, as well as the wild type LCAT and the N228K mutant, to the immobilized rHDL particles. Clearly, all three enzyme forms are capable of binding to lipoprotein surfaces,i.e. rHDL. The equilibrium K d values are listed in Table III and agree well with the values measured by ITC. Both mutants bind with about half the affinity of wild type LCAT to rHDL. As indicated above, the likely explanation for the discrepancy of the results for the T123I mutant between the two methods is that the small heat changes for this mutant do not reach the detection level required in the ITC measurements.Finally, the SPR method provides the first experimental measure of the association and dissociation rate constants for the binding of LCAT and its mutants to a lipoprotein particle (rHDL) (see Table III). Although the association rate constants are the same for the three forms of LCAT, the dissociation rate constants are 0.05 s−1 for wild type LCAT and increase to 0.08 and 0.12 s−1 for the T123I and N228K mutants, respectively.

K., Oscarson, S., and Brewer, C. F. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32812–32817). The data showed binding of specific hydroxyl groups on all three residues of the trimannoside, similar to that observed for ConA (Gupta, D., Dam, T. K., Oscarson, S., and Brewer, C. F. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6388–6392). However, differences exist in the thermodynamics of binding of monodeoxy analogs of the α(1–6) Man residue of the trimannoside to the two lectins. The x-ray crystal structure of DGL complexed to the core trimannoside, presented in the second paper in this series (Rozwarski, D. A., Swami, B. M., Brewer, C. F., and Sacchettini, J. C. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32818–32825), showed the overall structure of the complex to be similar to that of the ConA-trimannoside complex. Furthermore, the trimannoside is involved in nearly identical hydrogen bonding interactions in both complexes. However, differences were noted in the arrangement of ordered water molecules in the binding sites of the two lectins. The present study presents ITC measurements of DGL and ConA binding to the monodeoxy analogs of the trimannoside in hydrogen oxide (H2O) and deuterium oxide (D2O). The solvent isotope effects present in the thermodynamic binding data provide evidence for altered solvation of the parent trimannoside complexes at sites consistent with the x-ray crystal structures of both lectins. The results indicate that the differences in the thermodynamics of DGL and ConA binding to α(1–6) monodeoxy analogs of the trimannoside do not correlate with solvation differences of the parent trimannoside complexes.

The results showed evidence for the binding of the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of the α(1,6) Man residue, the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups of the α(1,3) Man residue, and the 2- and 4-hydroxyl groups of the central Man residue of the trimannoside.

Furthermore, the location and conformation of the bound trimannoside as well as its hydrogen bonding interactions are nearly identical in both lectin complexes. However, differences exist in the location of two loops outside of the respective binding sites containing residues 114–125 and residues 222–227. The latter residues effect the location of a network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that interact with the trisaccharide. Differences in the arrangement of ordered water molecules in the binding site of the two lectins may account for their differences in the thermodynamics of binding to deoxy α(1–6) analogs of the trimannoside (15Dam T.K.

In the present paper, ITC studies of the binding of DGL and ConA to mono- and disaccharides, and to trimannoside 1 and monodeoxy analogs 2-11 (Fig. 1) in hydrogen oxide (H2O) and deuterium oxide (D2O) are reported. The results show primary solvent isotope effects in the ΔH values of both lectins binding to the carbohydrates that correlate with the altered solvation observed in the x-ray structures of the two lectins complexed to the parent trimannoside. DGL was isolated from Dioclea grandiflora seeds obtained from northeastern Brazil (Albano Ferreira Martin Ltd., Sao Paulo, Brazil) as described previously (3Moreira R.A. Barros A.C.H. Stewart J.C. Pusztai A. Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The concentration of DGL was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using A1 cm1% = 12.0 at pH 7.2 and expressed in terms of monomer (M r = 25,000) (3Moreira R.A. Barros A.C.H. Stewart J.C. Pusztai A. Planta. 1983; 158: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ConA was prepared from jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) seeds (Sigma) according to the method of Agrawal and Goldstein (4Agrawal B.B.L. Goldstein I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 147: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The concentration of ConA was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using A1 cm1% = 13.7 at pH 7.2 (5Goldstein I.J.

MeαGlc, MeαMan, Manα(1–2)ManαOMe, Manα(1–3)ManαOMe, Manα(1–6)ManαOMe, and 1 were purchased from Sigma. Meα2dMan was a gift from Dr. S. Sabesan. Synthesis of deoxy analogs2–11 in Fig. 1 has been reported (6Oscarson S. Tedebark U. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 278: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Concentration of carbohydrates was determined by modification of the Dubois phenol-sulfuric acid method (7Saha S.K. Brewer C.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 254: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) using appropriate monosaccharides (Man, 2-deoxymannose, 3-deoxymannose, 4-deoxymannose, and 6-deoxymannose) as standards. Deuterium oxide (99.9% deuterium) was obtained from Sigma. ITC was performed using an MCS microcalorimeter from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). In individual titrations, injections of 4 μl of carbohydrate were added from the computer-controlled 100-μl microsyringe at an interval of 4 min into the lectin solution (cell volume = 1.35 ml) dissolved in the same buffer as the saccharide, while stirring at 350 rpm. Control experiments performed by making identical injections of saccharide into a cell containing buffer with no protein showed insignificant heats of dilution. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal, with ΔH(enthalpy change in kcal mol−1), K a(association constant in m−1), and n (number of binding sites per monomer), as adjustable parameters. The quantity c = K a M t(0), where M t(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration microcalorimetry (8Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandt J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with cvalues 1 < c < 200. The instrument was calibrated using the calibration kit containing RNase A and 2′-CMP supplied by the manufacturer. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the equation, ΔG=ΔH−TΔS=−RT lnKa(Eq. 1) where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding.T is the absolute temperature, and R = 1.98 cal mol−1 K−1. Experiments performed in deuterium oxide were found to have >99% deuterium by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer analysis of the solutions. The buffer used in H2O and D2O was 0.1 m Hepes, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.2 (adjusted for the 0.4 pH difference in D2O). The time that the two proteins were in the D2O solvent over a week did not alter the results. The results of ITC measurements of DGL and ConA binding to trimannoside 1 in H2O and D2O at pH 7.2 and 27 °C are shown in Tables I andII, respectively. The data show that both lectins exhibit significant primary solvent isotope effects in their ΔH values. The solvent isotope effects on the ΔH values for both lectins binding to 1 are proportional to the percentage of deuterium in the solvent as shown in Fig. 2 for DGL. In greater than 99% D2O, the difference in ΔH values for DGL in H2O and D2O (ΔΔHH2O − D2O) is 2.9 kcal mol−1. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) value for ConA is 2.0 kcal mol−1. Thus, the solvent isotope effect in ΔH for DGL binding to1 is greater than that for ConA.Table IITC solvent isotope effects in the binding of DGL to carbohydrates in H2O and D2OSugarSolventK a1-aErrors in K a values are between 2 and 10%.−ΔH1-bErrors in ΔH and TΔS are ±0.1–0.2 kcal mol−1.ΔΔH1-cErrors in ΔΔH are ±0.2–0.4 kcal mol−1.(H2O − D2O)−TΔS1-bErrors in ΔH and TΔS are ±0.1–0.2 kcal mol−1.−ΔGm−1 × 10−4kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molMeαMan1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O0.68.41.73.35.1MeαGlc1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O0.145.10.80.84.3Meα2dMan1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O0.257.61.43.04.6MaltoseH2O0.296.10.71.44.7IsomaltoseH2O0.276.31.11.64.7Manα(1–2)Man1-eManα(1–2)Man is Manα(1–2)ManαOMe.H2O3.09.91.33.86.1Manα(1–3)Man1-fManα(1–3)Man is Manα(1–3)ManαOMe.H2O1.810.11.44.35.8Manα(1–6)Man1-gManα(1–6)Man is Manα(1–6)ManαOMe.H2O0.568.61.13.55.1 1, trimannoside1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O12116.22.97.98.3 2, α(1–3)2-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O7915.23.37.18.1 3, α(1–3)3-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O4.811.21.34.86.4 4, α(1–3)4-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O5614.61.26.77.9 5, α(1–3)6-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O7415.11.87.18.0 6, α(1–6)2-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O2112.81.65.57.3 7, α(1–6)3-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O2.610.01.24.06.0 8, α(1–6)4-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O2.410.41.84.46.0 9, α(1–6)6-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O1.99.81.24.05.810, “core”2-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O2514.81.97.47.311, “core”4-deoxy1-dData taken from Ref. 15.H2O1112.82.35.96.9MeαManD2O0.706.71.45.3MeαGlcD2O0.114.30.24.1Meα2dManD2O0.576.21.15.1MaltoseD2O0.415.40.54.9IsomaltoseD2O0.385.20.34.9Manα(1–2)ManD2O2.88.62.56.1Manα(1–3)ManD2O1.78.72.95.8Manα(1–6)ManD2O0.887.52.15.4 1, trimannosideD2O9013.35.28.1 2, α(1–3)2-deoxyD2O4011.94.37.6 3, α(1–3)3-deoxyD2O6.79.93.26.6 4, α(1–3)4-deoxyD2O12013.45.18.3 5, α(1–3)6-deoxyD2O8413.35.28.1 6, α(1–6)2-deoxyD2O2211.23.97.3 7, α(1–6)3-deoxyD2O2.48.82.95.9 8, α(1–6)4-deoxyD2O1.78.62.85.8 9, α(1–6)6-deoxyD2O2.38.72.76.010, “core”2-deoxyD2O3412.95.37.611, “core”4-deoxyD2O1210.53.66.9The buffer was 0.1 m Hepes containing 0.9 mNaCl, 1 mm Mn2+, and 1 mm Ca2+at pH 7.2 in H2O and D2O.

The ITC data in Tables I and II also show that the ΔGvalues for the two lectins binding to 1 do not significantly change in H2O and D2O. ΔG for ConA in H2O and D2O is −7.6 kcal mol−1and −7.5 kcal mol−1, respectively. ΔG for DGL in H2O and D2O is −8.3 kcal mol−1 and −8.1 kcal mol−1, respectively. This indicates that enthalpy-entropy compensation occurs for binding of the two lectins to 1 in the two solvents. This will be further discussed below. Chervenak and Toone (9Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10533-10539Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar) reported much smaller solvent isotope effects on ΔH for ConA and DGL binding to 1 in H2O and D2O. ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) was 0.5 kcal mol−1 for ConA and 0.4 kcal mol−1 for DGL. Moreover, Chervenak and Toone also report ΔH values of −13.0 kcal mol−1 and −10.7 kcal mol−1 for DGL and ConA binding to 1, respectively, which are much lower than those reported here and in our previous ITC studies of ConA (−16.2 kcal mol−1 for DGL and −14.7 kcal mol−1 for ConA) (1Gupta D.

We have consistently obtained the values in Table I using two different ITC instruments, the Omega and MCS instruments from Microcal Inc. Since the primary hydrogen bonding contacts for DGL and ConA with trimannoside 1 are essentially the same (16Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32818-32825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), differences in the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for the two lectins suggest that other factors are involved. One of these could be differences in the ordered water molecules in the extended binding site regions of the ConA- and DGL-trimannoside complexes observed in their respective x-ray crystal structures (2Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (16Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32818-32825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In order to investigate this possibility, ITC primary solvent isotope studies in H2O and D2O were carried out with the two lectins and deoxy analogs 2–11 in Fig. 1. Primary solvent isotope effects have been used to characterize the kinetic and thermodynamic involvement of hydrogen bonding between water and donor/acceptor groups in small molecules and in protein complexes (cf. Refs. 12Quinn D.M. Sutton L.D. Theoretical Basis and Mechanistic Utility of Solvent Isotope Effects: Enzyme Mechanism from Isotope Effects.in: Cook P.F. CRC Press, Inc., Boston1991Google Scholar and 13Hibbert F. Emsley J. Bethell D. Advances in Physical Organic Chemistry. 26. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 255-391Google Scholar). Tables Iand II show the results of ITC measurements of the binding of DGL and ConA, respectively, to deoxy analogs 2–11 (Fig. 1) in H2O and D2O. To aid in the comparison of data, the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) results for the two lectins are shown in Fig. 3. Of the deoxy analogs of the α(1–3) arm of 1, the 2-deoxy analog (2) shows a ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) value of 3.3 kcal mol−1 for DGL binding compared with a value of 1.2 kcal mol−1 for ConA. The other three deoxy analogs of the α(1–3) arm, 3–5, (Fig. 1) showed far smaller differences in their ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values (1.3–1.8 kcal mol−1). The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data for binding of DGL and ConA to deoxy analogs of the α(1–6) arm of1 are shown in Tables I and II, respectively, as well as Fig. 3. The results show that 2-deoxy analog 6 exhibits the largest difference in the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for DGL (1.6 kcal mol−1) and ConA (0.7 kcal mol−1). The 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy analogs of the α(1–6) arm, 7, 8, and 9, respectively (Fig. 1), show less differences in the ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) values for the two lectins (1.2, 1.8, and 1.2 kcal mol−1 for DGL, respectively; 1.4, 1.5, and 1.3 kcal mol−1 for ConA, respectively). The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data for ConA and DGL binding to the 2- (10) and 4-deoxy (11) analogs of the central Man residue of trimannoside1 are also shown in Tables I and II as well as in Fig. 3. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data for DGL binding of the 4-deoxy analog 11 show a sizable difference in this parameter as compared with ConA. The DGL value is 2.3 kcal mol−1 as compared with 0.3 kcal mol−1 for ConA. These values contrast with relatively similar values for DGL (1.9 kcal mol−1) and ConA (1.5 kcal mol−1) binding the 2-deoxy analog 10. ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) data for DGL and ConA binding to MeαMan and MeαGlc are shown in Tables I and II as well as in Fig. 3. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for DGL binding to MeαMan and MeαGlc are 1.7 kcal mol−1 and 0.8 kcal mol−1, respectively. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for ConA binding to MeαMan and MeαGlc are 0.5 and 0.4 kcal mol−1, respectively. Thus, there is a larger difference in the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for DGL and ConA binding to MeαMan than MeαGlc. This is also observed to a lesser extent in the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for DGL and ConA binding to Meα2dMan of 1.4 and 0.7 kcal mol−1 (Tables I and II, respectively). Maltose and isomaltose, which are α(1–4) and α(1–6) disaccharides of Glc, respectively, were tested, and the results are shown in TablesI and II. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for DGL were 0.7 and 1.1 kcal mol−1, respectively, while the ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) values for ConA were 0.4 and 0.5 kcal mol−1, respectively. Thus, little difference is observed in these ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) for DGL and ConA. Manα(1–2)ManαOMe, Manα(1–3)ManαOMe, and Manα(1–4)ManαOMe were also tested, and the results are shown in Tables I and II. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for DGL binding were 1.3, 1.4, and 1.1 kcal mol−1, respectively. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for ConA were 0.5, 0.9, and 0.8 kcal mol−1, respectively. Thus, there is a slightly larger difference in the Manα(1–2)ManαOMe values for the two lectins as compared with the differences observed for the other two Man disaccharides. Fig. 4 shows schematic representations of the x-ray crystal structures of the binding site regions of ConA and DGL complexed to the core trimannoside. The structures show the presence of ordered water in the two complexes (16Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32818-32825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the primary contacts between the two lectins and the trimannoside are essentially the same in the two complexes, the location of ordered water molecules in the binding site regions differs in the complexes. This is due to amino acid substitutions in the regions adjacent to the contact residues in both proteins. The x-ray data reveal differences in the location of ordered water in the following three regions of the two complexes. The first region is associated with the 2-hydroxyl group on the α(1–3) Man of1. In the ConA complex (Fig. 4), the 2-hydroxyl on the α(1–3) Man interacts with W69 and indirectly with W58 via W69. In the DGL complex (Fig. 4), the 2-hyroxyl interacts with W69 and W68. W69, in turn, interacts with W70 and W68. W68 interacts with W59 and the carbonyl oxygen of Asn21. Thus, the location of ordered water around the 2-hydroxyl on the α(1–3) Man of 1 is different in the two complexes. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data for the α(1–3) deoxy analogs of 1 show that only the 2-deoxy analog (2) exhibits a large variation in the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) for DGL and ConA (Tables I and II; Fig. 3). ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) for DGL is 3.3 kcal mol−1 as compared with 0.8 kcal mol−1 for ConA. The other three analogs, 3–5, show much smaller differences in their ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values. The second region with altered order water in the two complexes is that associated with the 4-hydroxyl group of the central Man residue of1. In the ConA complex, the 4-hydroxyl is bonded to the side chain hydroxyl of Tyr12. However, in DGL, the 4-hydroxyl of the central Man residue is hydrogen-bonded to W41 in addition to the aromatic hydroxyl of Tyr12. W41, in turn, is close to W58, which binds to the side chain carbonyl oxygen of Glu205. In ConA, His205 is present at this site. Thus, the 4-hydroxyl group of the central Man residue of 1 is differentially solvated by ordered water in the two complexes. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data for the two deoxy analogs of the central Man residue of 1show that the 4-deoxy analog (11) exhibits a significant difference in this parameter for DGL relative to that for ConA (TablesI and II; Fig. 3). The ΔΔH value for DGL of 2.3 kcal mol−1 is much greater than the value for ConA of 0.3 kcal mol−1. In contrast, the ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) values for DGL and ConA binding to 2-deoxy analog (10) of 1.9 kcal mol−1 and 1.5 kcal mol−1, respectively, show little difference. The third area of the x-ray crystal structures of the DGL and ConA complexes that differs in ordered water structures is near the 2-hydroxyl on the α(1–6) arm of 1 (Fig. 4). W66 and W87 are both present in the two complexes, with both binding to the 2-hydroxyl on the α(1–6) arm. W87, however, is adjacent to a water molecule bonded to Ser168 in ConA, while in DGL W87 is adjacent to the side chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn168. In addition, W67, which is adjacent to W66 in both complexes, is bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Thr226 in ConA but to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly226 in DGL. Furthermore, W66 in ConA is directly bonded to the side chain hydroxyl of Thr226, but in DGL W66 is bonded to W89. Thus, the secondary ordered water layer near the 2-hydroxyl on the α(1–6) arm of 1 is different in the two complexes. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data for DGL and ConA binding to the deoxy analogs of the α(1–6) arm of1 show that the 2-deoxy derivative (2) possesses the largest difference in their respective values. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) value for DGL is 1.6 kcal mol−1, while the ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) value for ConA is 0.7 kcal mol−1. The other three analogs, 3–5, show much smaller differences (Tables I and II; Fig. 3). The relative magnitude of the ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) values of DGL and ConA in Tables I and II for deoxy analogs 2, 6, and11 also show a correlation with the numbers and strength of water molecules interacting with corresponding hydroxyl groups of the parent trimannoside in the respective complexes. For example, the largest ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) value for DGL is for binding 2 (3.3 kcal mol−1). This contrasts with the corresponding ConA value of 1.2 kcal mol−1. Fig. 4 shows that in DGL the 2-hydroxyl of the α(1–3) Man of 1 is directly hydrogen-bonded to two water molecules (W69 and W68), while in ConA only one water molecule (W69) is observed to bind to this hydroxyl group. Furthermore, W69 is closer to the hydroxyl group in DGL (3.1 Å) than in ConA (3.4 Å). Thus, the number and apparent strength of hydrogen-bonding water molecules to the 2-hydroxyl of the α(1–3) Man of 1appears greater in DGL than in ConA. The next largest value of ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) for DGL is 2.3 kcal mol−1 for11. The corresponding value for ConA is 0.3 kcal mol−1. Fig. 4 shows that the 4-hydroxyl of the core Man of1 is directly bonded to W41 in DGL. However, there is an absence of electron density for a solvent molecule at this position in the ConA complex. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) value for DGL binding to 6 of 1.6 kcal mol−1 is lower than those for 2 and 11. The corresponding value for ConA is 0.7 kcal mol−1. In this case, the x-ray data (Fig. 4) shows altered solvent structure in the second hydration layer near the 2-hydroxyl of the α(1–6) Man of 1 in both complexes. Thus, differences in numbers and strength of the water molecules in DGL and ConA interacting with specific hydroxyl groups of trimannoside1 appear to be reflected in the magnitude of the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for2, 6, and 11. The ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) values for MeαMan and MeαGlc in Tables I and II also show a correlation with the altered ordered water structures observed in the binding site regions of the DGL and ConA complexed with the trimannoside (Fig. 4). Since MeαMan occupies the same site as the α(1–6) Man residue of 1 and makes similar contacts with ConA (2Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the altered ordered water near the 2-hydroxyl of the α(1–6) Man residue of 1 in the DGL and ConA complexes is present in their respective complexes with the monosaccharide. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) value for DGL binding to MeαMan (1.7 kcal mol−1) is considerably greater than that for ConA (0.5 kcal mol−1), which is consistent with altered solvation of these two lectin complexes. Furthermore, the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for DGL binding to MeαMan (1.7 kcal mol−1) and MeαGlc (0.8 kcal mol−1) are substantially different, while the corresponding values for ConA binding to the two monosaccharides of 0.5 and 0.4 kcal mol−1, respectively, are not. Since the two sugars differ in the orientation of their 2-hydroxyl groups (axial and equatorial, respectively), these results are consistent with altered solvation of the two monosaccharide complexes in both lectins, specifically at the 2-axial hydroxyl group of Man in both lectins. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data for DGL and ConA binding to Me2dαMan in Tables I and II are also suggestive of differential solvation of the respective complexes. The ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data for DGL binding to the monosaccharide is 1.4 kcal mol−1, while for ConA the value is 0.7 kcal mol−1. Interestingly, no similar obvious trend in the ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) data is observed for the Man and Glc disaccharides listed in Tables I and II. This suggests that solvation of these longer oligosaccharides in the respective DGL and ConA complexes moderates any differential solvation effects observed for the monosaccharides, trimannoside 1 and its deoxy analogs. The altered water structure observed in Fig. 4 for the ConA and DGL complex complexes with trimannoside1 is consistent with the observed ΔΔH(H2O − D2O) values of deoxy analogs2, 6, and 11. This provides confirmation that the differences in the ordered water structures observed in the x-ray crystal complexes of the two lectins with the core trimannoside exist in their corresponding solution complexes. These results allow consideration of the contribution of altered structural water near the α(1–6) Man of 1 in the two complexes to the differences in the ΔΔH values of the deoxy analogs of the α(1–6) Man of 1 reported in the first paper in this series (15Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ΔΔH values of DGL in H2O for the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxy analogs of 1 (6–9) in Fig. 1 are observed to be ∼3 kcal mol−1 greater than the corresponding values in ConA (15Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 4, and together with the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) data in the present study, the altered water structure in that region of the two complexes appears to effect primarily the 2-hydroxyl of the α(1–6) Man of 1 and not the 3-, 4-, and 6-hyroxyl groups. The 3-hydroxyl of the α(1–6) Man of 1is in contact with W60 in both complexes, while the 4- and 6-hydroxyl groups are not directly bonded to water molecules. In addition, the ΔΔH values of DGL and ConA in D2O for deoxy analogs 7–9 show a difference of ∼2.0 kcal mol−1 as compared with the ∼3 kcal mol−1difference in H2O. On the other hand, the 2-deoxy analog (6) shows a reversal (0.8 kcal mol−1) of this difference between the two lectins in H2O and D2O (Tables I and II). Thus, the altered water structure near the α(1–6) Man of 1 may account for the differences in the ΔΔH values of DGL and ConA for the 2-deoxy analog (2) binding to the two lectins. However, the altered water structure in this region of the two lectin complexes does not appear to account for the differences in the ΔΔH values in H2O and D2O for ConA and DGL binding to deoxy analogs 7–9. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that the altered water structures near the 4-hydroxyl of the central Man residue of1 and altered water structures near the 2-hydroxyl of the α(1–3) Man of 1 in the two lectin complexes do not appear to have an effect on the ΔΔH values for the two lectins binding the core 4-deoxy analog (11) and the α(1–6) 2-deoxy analog (2) in H2O (Tables I and II). The ΔΔH value for ConA binding 2 is 0.6 kcal mol−1, while the ΔΔH value for DGL binding2 is 1 kcal mol−1. The ΔΔH value for ConA binding 11 is 2.6 kcal mol−1, while the ΔΔH value for DGL binding 11 is 3.4 kcal mol−1 (Tables I and II). Thus, the results indicate that altered structural water in these two regions of the DGL and ConA complexes with 1 do not correlate with the ΔΔH values in H2O of both lectins for2 and 11. One of the remaining possibilities for explaining the differences in the ΔΔH values of DGL and ConA binding to the α(1–6) 3-, 4-, and 6-deoxymannose analogs of 1 is different energetic conformational transitions leading to the bound trimannoside-deoxy analog complexes. In order to examine this possibility, the unbound structures of both lectins are required. While the structure of ConA is known (14Hardman K.D. Ainsworth C.F. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4910-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the unbound structure of DGL is not. This question awaits determination of the latter structure. Plots of −ΔH versus−TΔS for DGL binding to 1–11 in H2O and D2O are shown in Fig. 5 A. The plot for DGL in H2O is a straight line with a slope of 1.60 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99. This result is similar to that reported in our first paper in this series for the deoxy trimannosides, which included a tetradeoxy analog (15Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The plot for D2O is a straight line with a slope of 1.72 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Thus, the solvent isotope effect on DGL binding to1–11 is evident in the enthalpy-entropy compensation plots of the data in Table I. A similar plot of the data for ConA (Fig. 5 B) also shows straight lines in H2O and D2O. The slope of the data in H2O is 1.45 with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. These results are similar to those recently reported by us for ConA binding to the deoxy analogs in Fig. 1 and to di- and trideoxy analogs of 1 (1Gupta D. Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6388-6392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The slope of the data in D2O is 1.59 with a correlation coefficient of 0.97. Thus, the solvent isotope effect on ConA binding to the carbohydrates in Fig. 1 is evident in the enthalpy-entropy compensation plots of the data in Table II. The present study demonstrates that ITC measurements of solvent isotope effects in the ΔH values of DGL and ConA binding to certain monosaccharides and deoxy analogs of trimannoside 1 in H2O and D2O are sensitive to altered solvation of the core trimannoside at specific sites, consistent with the x-ray crystal structures of the two respective lectin complexes. Differences in the numbers and strength of the water molecules in DGL and ConA interacting with specific hydroxyl groups of trimannoside 1 appear to be reflected in the magnitude of the ΔΔH (H2O − D2O) values for 2, 6, and11. Thus, evidence that solvation differences exist in solution for the DGL and ConA complexes with 1 has been obtained. The results allow us to conclude that differences in the ΔΔH values of α(1–6) deoxy analogs of 1binding to DGL and ConA in H2O do not correlate with solvation differences of the parent trimannoside complexes. The origin of these differences is presently being investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2087945807,"Intracellular Ca2+ pools play an essential role in generating Ca2+ signals. The heterogeneity of intracellular Ca2+ pools reflects the complex and dynamic character of the endoplasmic reticulum within which they reside. Translocation of Ca2+ between distinct subcompartments of the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by a sensitive and specific GTP-activated process involving formation of reversible communicating junctions (Rys-Sikora, K. E., Ghosh, T. K., and Gill, D. L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31607–31613). In the presence of palmitate at 10 μm or above, this GTP-activated mechanism mediates substantial Ca2+ accumulation within a specific Ca2+-pumping pool. The fatty acid- and GTP-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ was highly chain length-specific; pentadecanoate (C15) and palmitate (C16) were equally effective, whereas fatty acids of shorter or longer chain length were either marginally effective or devoid of effect. Fatty acids with one or more unsaturated carbons were without effect, regardless of chain length. Palmitate-induced Ca2+ accumulation was immediately terminated with 2 μm palmitoyl-CoA, a blocker of the GTP-activated Ca2+-translocating mechanism. The anion transport inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid completely prevented both palmitate- and oxalate-mediated GTP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation, with EC50 ∼ 30 μm. Ca2+ sequestered in the presence of palmitate and GTP could be immediately and completely released by A23187, whereas the sequestered Ca2+was remarkably resistant to release induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). In contrast, oxalate-sequestered Ca2+ within the same pool could be effectively released by either ionophore or InsP3. The results indicate that fatty acids are specifically transported into the lumen of a subset of Ca2+ pools, wherein they mediate substantial sequestration of Ca2+ in a distinct membrane-associated substate that is not readily releasable by opened InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Intracellular Ca2+ pools play an essential role in generating Ca2+ signals. The heterogeneity of intracellular Ca2+ pools reflects the complex and dynamic character of the endoplasmic reticulum within which they reside. Translocation of Ca2+ between distinct subcompartments of the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by a sensitive and specific GTP-activated process involving formation of reversible communicating junctions (Rys-Sikora, K. E., Ghosh, T. K., and Gill, D. L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31607–31613). In the presence of palmitate at 10 μm or above, this GTP-activated mechanism mediates substantial Ca2+ accumulation within a specific Ca2+-pumping pool. The fatty acid- and GTP-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ was highly chain length-specific; pentadecanoate (C15) and palmitate (C16) were equally effective, whereas fatty acids of shorter or longer chain length were either marginally effective or devoid of effect. Fatty acids with one or more unsaturated carbons were without effect, regardless of chain length. Palmitate-induced Ca2+ accumulation was immediately terminated with 2 μm palmitoyl-CoA, a blocker of the GTP-activated Ca2+-translocating mechanism. The anion transport inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid completely prevented both palmitate- and oxalate-mediated GTP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation, with EC50 ∼ 30 μm. Ca2+ sequestered in the presence of palmitate and GTP could be immediately and completely released by A23187, whereas the sequestered Ca2+was remarkably resistant to release induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). In contrast, oxalate-sequestered Ca2+ within the same pool could be effectively released by either ionophore or InsP3. The results indicate that fatty acids are specifically transported into the lumen of a subset of Ca2+ pools, wherein they mediate substantial sequestration of Ca2+ in a distinct membrane-associated substate that is not readily releasable by opened InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels. endoplasmic reticulum sarcoplasmic reticulum inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate intracellular-like medium 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase.

Intracellular pools of Ca2+ are fundamental elements in the generation of Ca2+ signals, yet little is known about the nature and distribution of the organelles that serve as Ca2+ pools (4Gill D.L.

However, the ER represents an extensive and heterogeneous network of cisternae undergoing continuous dynamic changes in morphology through active membrane trafficking events. It is therefore not surprising that Ca2+ pools are observed to be structurally and functionally heterogeneous in particular with respect to distribution of InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (8Ghosh T.K.

In addition, we and others have characterized a sensitive and specific guanine nucleotide-activated process that appears to mediate translocation of Ca2+ between organelles within cells (12Dawson A.P.

This Ca2+ translocation process is rapid, temperature-sensitive, and dependent on the hydrolysis of GTP and represents a movement of Ca2+ quite distinct from that activated by InsP3 (7Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ghosh T.K. Mullaney J.M. Tarazi F.I. Gill D.L.

The process of Ca2+ transfer may involve a close interaction between ER subcompartments and the cytoskeleton and may be particularly evident after disruption or fragmentation of the ER (20Hajnoczky G. Lin C. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10280-10287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although no specific GTP-binding protein has been identified as mediating the Ca2+ transfer, it is likely that transfer reflects the function of one or more of the class of small GTP-binding proteins that are known to control many of the membrane trafficking and translocation events that occur within the ER and other organelles of the secretory pathway (4Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Graber M.N. Favre C.J. Alfonso A. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D.

The mechanism by which GTP activates Ca2+ transfer requires close contacts between membranes (7Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 625-649Crossref Google Scholar), but the underlying process mediating Ca2+ transfer has not been elucidated. Work by Comerford and Dawson (22Comerford J.G. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Comerford J.G. Dawson A.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) has suggested that GTP-induced Ca2+ movements may reflect the activation of fusion between membranes. Instead, we have interpreted our results to indicate that the rapid fluxes of Ca2+ observed in response to GTP reflect a process that may precede a subsequently activated membrane fusion event (16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 625-649Crossref Google Scholar, 24Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, studies have shown that acyl-CoA esters can not only block, but also reverse the action of GTP in inducing Ca2+ transfer (24Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we revealed that fatty acyl-CoA esters allosterically modify a component of the GTP-activated process, resulting in a rapid termination and reversal of Ca2+transfer. It is difficult to reconcile this rapid reversing action of acyl-CoA esters with a mechanism by which GTP induces Ca2+movements via a membrane fusion event since, having taken place, membrane fusion is an essentially irreversible process. Instead, we concluded that GTP rapidly induces a communicating prefusion complex between membranes that allows Ca2+ transfer and that, later, may lead to full fusion between membranes (4Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Graber M.N. Favre C.J. Alfonso A. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand more about the progression of these events, we investigated the actions of agents that might modify the membrane and enhance the process of membrane fusion. Surprisingly, one class of agents used for such analysis, nonesterified fatty acids, induced a remarkable chain length-specific alteration in the accumulation of Ca2+observed after activation of the GTP-induced Ca2+ transfer process. Our results indicate that specific fatty acids are transported into the lumen of a subset of Ca2+ pools, wherein they mediate substantial sequestration of Ca2+ in a distinct membrane-associated substate; although readily releasable by application of ionophore, the release of this fatty acid-complexed Ca2+ through opened InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ release channels is highly restricted. Cells of the hamster smooth muscle cell line DDT1MF-2 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2.5% serum (Calf-Plus, Inovar Chemicals, Inc., Gaithersburg MD) as described previously (25Ufret-Vincenty C.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29546-29553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged every 7 days, and media changes were performed on days 3 and 5 after passaging. Cells used in experiments had been grown for 4 days after passaging. The procedures for cell permeabilization were as described earlier (24Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, suspensions of DDT1MF-2 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with 0.0025% saponin in an intracellular-like medium (ICM; comprising 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0) at 37 °C until 95% permeabilization occurred (normally 2–3 min). After permeabilization, cells were washed twice in saponin-free ICM at 4 °C and kept cold before use in experiments. To avoid problems of lipid dilution of added hydrophobic compounds, the final cell concentration in all experiments was kept at exactly 5 × 105 cells/ml. Ca2+ flux measurements were conducted as described previously (24Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ghosh T.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The accumulation of Ca2+ in intracellular organelles was measured using permeabilized DDT1MF-2 cells (5 × 105cells/ml) maintained with gentle stirring at 37 °C in ICM containing 50 μm CaCl2 (with 150 Ci/mol45Ca2+), EGTA (to buffer free Ca2+to exactly 0.1 μm), 3% polyethylene glycol, and 5 μm ruthenium red (to prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation) in a total volume of 2 ml. Effectors indicated in the figures (GTP, InsP3, and A23187) were added at the times shown. Fatty acids or oxalate, with or without GTP or DIDS when present, were added immediately prior to the start of uptake or as shown in the figures. At required times, 200-μl aliquots were removed from the stirred uptake medium, diluted immediately into 4 ml of ice-cold ICM containing 1 mm LaCl3, rapidly vacuum-filtered on glass-fiber filters (Schleicher and Schuell, type 31), washed, and counted. For the palmitate concentration curves, all additions of fatty acids with or without GTP were made prior to the start of the experiment. For the curves shown, Ca2+ loading was for 6 min, at which time three successive aliquots were taken, and accumulation was determined. In other experiments (data not shown), Ca2+ loading was monitored for 12 min as described. In fatty acid chain length specificity experiments, Ca2+accumulation was assessed only after 12 min of Ca2+loading. The figures show ATP-dependent Ca2+accumulation with that component of Ca2+ retained by cells and filters in the absence of ATP subtracted (∼0.1% of total Ca2+). All experiments shown are typical of at least three separate experiments (and in most cases, a considerably larger number). InsP3 and A23187 were purchased from Calbiochem. ATP, GTP, EGTA, polyethylene glycol, saponin, ruthenium red, Hepes, DIDS, oxalate, and all fatty acids were purchased from Sigma. Fatty acids were each dissolved in methanol/Me2SO (1:1), sonicated, and stored at −20 °C in capped vials containing N2. Before addition to experiments, fatty acids were again sonicated and added to permeabilized cell suspensions in ICM in no more than 1% of the final 2-ml volume. All controls contained equivalent quantities of the solvent without fatty acid. Visible turbidity of solutions was only observed with palmitate at a final concentration of 300 μm or higher. The DDT1MF-2 cell line was originally obtained from Drs. James Norris and Lawrence Cornett (University of Arkansas). Free Ca2+ concentrations were controlled using EGTA, computing all complexes between EGTA, ATP, Ca2+, Mg2+, monovalent cations, and protons, as described previously (30Gill D.L. Chueh S.-H. Whitlow C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10807-10813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of distinct Ca2+ pools in accumulating, releasing, and transferring Ca2+ has been studied extensively in several permeabilized cell systems (16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D. Waldron R.T.

An important feature of the Ca2+ movements observed has been the role of a sensitive and specific guanine nucleotide-induced Ca2+ translocation process (4Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E.

As shown in Fig. 1 A, Ca2+accumulated within internal pools of permeabilized DDT1MF-2 cells via SERCA pump activity in the presence of 1 mm ATP was rapidly released by addition of 20 μm GTP; more than half of the accumulated Ca2+ was released within 30 s. Thus, GTP caused release from only a proportion of the pools able to accumulate Ca2+ as compared with the action of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, which released Ca2+ from all of the Ca2+-pumping pools. The action of GTP on Ca2+ pools has been studied extensively and is believed to result from a GTP-induced transfer of Ca2+ between distinct subcompartments (8Ghosh T.K. Mullaney J.M. Tarazi F.I.

Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ transfer is believed to result from the activation of junctional complexes between distinct Ca2+-pumping compartments of the endoplasmic reticulum (16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 625-649Crossref Google Scholar, 24Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such junctions allow the passage of Ca2+ ions and perhaps other small molecules, but, since they can be reversed (24Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), appear not to represent fusion between membranes. Our studies indicate that the GTP-activated process may represent a rapid prefusion event (16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 625-649Crossref Google Scholar, 24Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that, in a substantially longer period following the GTP-induced interaction, fusion between different vesicular components of the ER may take place (7Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Handb. Exp.

J. 1993; 289: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Since, in permeabilized cells, a small component of the ER appears to exist as non-intact vesicular membranes, the rapid transfer process induced by GTP results in the fast release of a substantial proportion of the accumulated Ca2+ (7Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar,16Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 625-649Crossref Google Scholar), as observed in Fig. 1 A. To determine more about the mechanism of the GTP-induced Ca2+ transfer process, we investigated the actions of fatty acids. As stated earlier, the rationale for examining fatty acids was to determine whether such lipid molecules might modify the effectiveness of GTP by promoting membrane interactions and enhancing the rate of subsequent membrane fusion. The introduction of up to 100 μm palmitate into the Ca2+ uptake medium induced only a slight augmenting action on Ca2+pump-mediated Ca2+ accumulation within the permeabilized DDT1MF-2 cells (Fig. 1 B). However, in stark contrast to the results shown in Fig. 1 A, addition of GTP in the presence of palmitate resulted in a rapid and dramatic increase in the accumulation of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B). Under these conditions, the action of GTP was biphasic, inducing initially a slight release of Ca2+ before this changed to a large and continuous increase in Ca2+ accumulation. The methyl ester of palmitate had no effect on Ca2+ accumulation (data not shown), indicating that the carboxyl group was important for the stimulation of Ca2+ uptake with GTP. Without GTP addition, the Ca2+ accumulated in the presence of palmitate could still be fully released with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (Fig. 1 B), indicating no obvious difference in the state of accumulated Ca2+ induced by palmitate. Likewise, after loading pools in the presence of palmitate, passive Ca2+release induced by Ca2+ pump inhibition with thapsigargin was unchanged (data not shown), suggesting no obvious alteration in Ca2+ release. As shown below (see Fig. 7), palmitate did not alter the function of Ca2+ release through InsP3 receptors. The large accumulation of Ca2+induced by GTP in the presence of palmitate was dependent on Ca2+ pumping, with no change in Ca2+accumulation being observed without ATP also being present. Under the standard conditions for Ca2+ accumulation, the low concentration of free Ca2+ (0.1 μm) and the presence of ruthenium red ensured that no mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was occurring (7Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Wang J.C. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8801-8806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At a higher free Ca2+ concentration (10 μm), in the absence of ruthenium red, the accumulation of Ca2+ was predominantly mitochondrial (7Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar), yet under this condition, palmitate and/or GTP again induced no alteration of the mitochondrial component of Ca2+ accumulation (data not shown). The concentration dependence of the effect of palmitate on reversing GTP-induced Ca2+ fluxes in permeabilized cells is shown in Fig. 2. In this experiment, Ca2+ accumulation was measured after 6 min with the simultaneous addition of ATP and palmitate, with or without 20 μm GTP, all at the start of Ca2+ uptake. Under these conditions, concentrations of palmitate above 3 μm caused significant Ca2+ entry; the action of palmitate was half-maximal at ∼25 μm and maximal at 100 μm. In the absence of GTP, little change in Ca2+ accumulation occurred with palmitate concentrations as high as 300 μm. If a longer time interval for Ca2+ accumulation was used, the total amount of Ca2+ that could be sequestered in the presence of GTP and palmitate continued to increase; after 12 min, total Ca2+accumulation could reach as high as 8 nmol/106 cells (data not shown). Measured with a 12-min incubation, the sensitivity to palmitate was slightly increased, with half-maximal activation closer to 10 μm. Although 300 μm palmitate had no greater effect than 100 μm, introduction of concentrations beyond 300 μm induced a sharply concentration-sensitive decrease in Ca2+ accumulation in the presence or absence of GTP (data not shown). This reduction in Ca2+ accumulation at high palmitate levels likely reflects a generalized deleterious action of palmitate on the integrity of the membrane through detergent-like effects of the fatty acid. Indeed, at or above 300 μm, some turbidity following addition of palmitate indicated the formation of larger fatty acid complexes. The critical micelle concentration for fatty acids is highly dependent on ionic conditions and, although not known in the presence of the intracellular-like conditions used, was likely to have been exceeded at 300 μm palmitate. Physiological levels of free nonesterified fatty acids inside cells are difficult to assess. In serum, the level of total nonesterified fatty acid can be in the millimolar range, palmitate being one of the most abundant of fatty acids; however, a large proportion of this total fatty acid is bound to albumin and other serum proteins. Fatty acids inside cells are likely to be similarly bound to proteins and/or partitioned within membranes. Experiments with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles have revealed that palmitate in the mid-micromolar range is efficiently incorporated into the vesicle bilayer (33Herbette L.G. Favreau C. Segalman K. Napolitano C.A. Watras J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1325-1335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the monounsaturated C18 fatty acid oleate at these concentrations caused considerable disruption and fusion of SR vesicles, whereas, in contrast, palmitate induced no fusion of the vesicles and no morphological alteration in the membrane except for an increase in the lateral volume of the membranes (33Herbette L.G. Favreau C. Segalman K. Napolitano C.A. Watras J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1325-1335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Important to assess was any structural requirement among fatty acids for stimulating GTP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation, particularly with respect to chain length and degree of saturation. Indeed, the results reveal a striking structural specificity for fatty acids. A comparison of the effects of saturated fatty acids of different chain l"

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, four proteins, Prp16p, Prp17p, Prp18p, and Slu7p are exclusively required for the second step of splicing. The human homologs of Prp16p, Prp17p, and Prp18p have been identified, and the human proteins hPrp16 and hPrp18 have been shown to be required for the second step of splicing in vitro. Here we provide further evidence for the functional conservation of the second step factors between yeast and humans. Human hPrp17, which is 35% identical to the S. cerevisiaeprotein, is able to partially rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype in a yeast strain where PRP17 has been knocked out, suggesting that the human and yeast proteins are functionally conserved. Overexpression of hPrp17 in the knockout yeast strain partially rescues the splicing defect seen in vitro and in vivo. In HeLa cells, hPrp17 is highly concentrated in the nuclear speckles, as is SC35 and many other splicing factors, thus providing further support that this protein also functions as a splicing factor in humans.

Splicing is the process by which introns are removed from pre-mRNAs, and it occurs via two phosphoryl transfer reactions (reviewed in Ref. 1Nilsen T.W. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 303-357Google Scholar). In the first step, the 5′-exon is cleaved concomitantly with the production of a lariat intermediate. In the second step, the 3′-splice site is cleaved, the exons are ligated, and the intron is released as a lariat product. This process is catalyzed by a multi-component enzyme called the spliceosome. The conventional sliceosome is formed on the pre-mRNA by the assembly of U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 snRNPs,1 as well as a large number of non-snRNP splicing factors. Genetic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have lead to the identification of four proteins (Prp16p, Prp17p, Prp18p, and Slu7p) that are specifically required for the second step of splicing in yeast (reviewed in Ref. 2Umen J.G. Guthrie C. RNA. 1995; 1: 869-885PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in PRP16, PRP17, and PRP18 cause accumulation of splicing reaction intermediates at nonpermissive temperature (3Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Vijayraghavan U. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The genes that encode Prp17p and Prp18p are not essential for cell survival, and absence of either protein causes only a partial block to the second step of splicing in vitro (5Horowitz D.S. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2959-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Jones M.H. Frank D.N. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9687-9691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This may be because of overlapping functions in some of the second step splicing factors. In fact, the overexpression of Prp16p can suppress a PRP17mutation, and overexpression of Slu7p suppresses a PRP18mutation (6Jones M.H. Frank D.N. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9687-9691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mutations in SLU7 (slu7-1) and PRP17 (slu4-1) are synthetically lethal with mutations in the invariant loop 1 of U5 snRNA (7Frank D. Patterson B. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5197-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). U5 snRNA interacts with exon sequences at both the 5′- and 3′-splice sites and most likely plays a significant role in aligning the two exons during the second step of splicing (reviewed in Ref. 1Nilsen T.W. Simons R.W. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 303-357Google Scholar). Prp8p, a highly conserved U5 snRNP protein, is required for specificity and fidelity of 3′-splice site utilization (8Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Genetics. 1996; 143: 723-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alleles of PRP16, PRP17, PRP18, and SLU7 are all synthetically lethal with an allele of PRP8, prp8–101, which impairs recognition of the 3′-splice site and inhibits the second step (8Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These and other genetic studies indicate that there may be a network of physical interactions between Prp16p, Prp17p, Prp18p, Slu7p, and Prp8p (reviewed in Ref. 2Umen J.G. Guthrie C. RNA. 1995; 1: 869-885PubMed Google Scholar). The requirements for Prp16p, Prp17p, Prp18p, and Slu7p have been temporally ordered with respect to each other and to the requirement for ATP hydrolysis during the second step of splicing (reviewed in Ref.2Umen J.G. Guthrie C. RNA. 1995; 1: 869-885PubMed Google Scholar). Prp16p and Prp17p act before or concomitant with an ATP-dependent step of splicing, whereas Slu7p and Prp18p act subsequent to this ATP-dependent step (6Jones M.H. Frank D.N. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9687-9691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Schwer B. Guthrie C. Nature. 1991; 349: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 11Horowitz D.S. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Ansari A. Schwer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4001-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After the first step of splicing, Prp16p can be efficiently cross-linked to the 3′-splice site, and this binding is Prp17p independent (13Umen J.G. Guthrie C. RNA. 1995; 1: 584-597PubMed Google Scholar). After ATP hydrolysis by Prp16p, Slu7p and Prp8p can be efficiently cross-linked to the 3′-splice site in a manner that is dependent on Prp16p, Prp17p, and Prp18p (13Umen J.G. Guthrie C. RNA. 1995; 1: 584-597PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the Prp17p-dependent step is after Prp16p binds the 3′-splice site but before or concomitant with ATP hydrolysis. The second step of splicing is understood less in mammals. As in yeast, there is an ATP requirement during the second step, and partially purified second step activities have been functionally ordered with respect to this requirement (14Sawa H. Ohno M. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Lindsey L.A. Crow A.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13415-13421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, the mammalian structural homologs of Prp18p (hPrp18), Prp16p (hPrp16), and Prp17p (hPrp17) were identified (16Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Zhou Z. Reed R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). hPrp18 and hPrp16 were both shown to be required for the second step of splicing in vitro (16Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,17Zhou Z. Reed R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A functional role for hPrp17 has not been shown, although both hPrp17 and hPrp16 associate with the spliceosome late in the splicing pathway (17Zhou Z. Reed R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It appears that many of the second step factors are conserved between yeast and humans. In fact, here we show that the human homolog of Prp17p can partially complement the yeast knockout strain. The human protein specifically increases the rate of the second step in vitro suggesting that this protein is not only structurally homologous to the yeast protein but also functionally related. hPrp17 localizes to the nuclear speckles in human cells, as do many splicing factors (reviewed in Ref. 18Spector D.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 265-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), thus providing further support that this protein also functions as a splicing factor in humans. A data base search was performed using the Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package TBLASTN program to identify human EST translations with high homology to S. cerevisiaePrp17p. 2M. Company and J. Abelson, unpublished results. Alignment of two human ESTs (AA057404 and Z19190) with the yeast sequence was the basis for designing two oligonucleotides, 5′–GGC CGG ATC CGA CTA TCA AGG CAG GTC CTA T-3′ and 5′-GGC CGA ATT CGA CCT TAG AAG TTT CAT GAG G-3′, which were used for PCR amplification of DNA from an oligo(dT)-primed HeLa cell cDNA library (Stratagene). The resulting 960-base pair PCR product was gel purified and subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Both strands of the cDNA were sequenced, and the 5′-end of the cDNA was obtained using 5′-RACE-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) for nested PCR with the supplied anchor primer and oligonucleotides 5′-CTG TCC TGT CTC AGT GTC CCA-3′ and 5′-AAC AAT CTG ACT GCA CTG ACG CCC-3′. The 670-base pair PCR product was purified, cloned into a TA vector, and sequenced. The 3′-end of the cDNA was also obtained by nested PCR using a T7 primer (5′-GTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG C-3′) specific for the library vector and oligonucleotides 5′-AGC ATG CCA ATC AAT GGA CAA CC-3′ and 5′-AGG GCC ATA TGG TAG CAG GC-3′. The hPrp17 cDNA sequence that we obtained is identical to that recently published by Zhou and Reed (17Zhou Z. Reed R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Prp17p homologs (cePrp17 cosmid Y95D11; spPrp17 GenBankTMaccession number AL021838) were aligned using PILEUP (Genetics Computer Group) and shaded with BOXSHADE where 50% identity at a position is shaded. Full-length yPRP17, truncated yPRP17 (amino acids 1–149), and full-length hPRP17 were cloned into the multicopy plasmid pG1 (19Schena M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Vectors for Constitutive and Inducible Gene Expression in Yeast. Meth. Enzym..in: Guthrie C. Fink G.R. 194. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar) for overexpression in yeast from the GPD1 promoter. Yeast haploid strains SJ121 (WT) and SJ136 (Δprp17) (kindly provided by C. Guthrie) (6Jones M.H. Frank D.N. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9687-9691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were transformed with pG1 alone, pG1-yPRP17, pG1-yPRPΔC, or pG1-hPRP17, and the yeast were selected on medium lacking tryptophan for 5 days at 25 °C. A colony was resuspended in medium, the yeast were counted, and serial dilutions of 5-fold were made from 12,000 to 20 yeast. The yeast were grown on medium lacking tryptophan for 3 days at 25, 30, 34, or 37 °C, and then photographed. Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described by Lin et al. (20Lin R.J. Newman A.J. Cheng S.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14780-14792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from SJ121 and SJ136 strains that were transformed with pG1, pG1-hPRP17, or pG1-yPRP17. The actin pre-mRNA substrate was described by O'Keefe et al. (21O'Keefe R.T. Norman C. Newman A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and synthesized in vitro essentially as described previously and gel purified on an 8% denaturing acrylamide gel. Splicing reactions were performed at 23 °C as described previously (20Lin R.J. Newman A.J. Cheng S.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14780-14792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Splicing products and intermediates were visualized by autoradiography, and the specific bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All numbers were adjusted for molar equivalents, and the level of second step activity was calculated as the percentage of products (lariat product + mRNA) divided by the sum of the intermediates and products (lariat intermediate + 5′-exon + lariat product + mRNA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 129–144 of hPrp17 (Research Genetics). The antibodies were affinity-purified on columns with the peptide cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described previously (23Fu X.-D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, fixed and stained with primary antibodies: 2 μg/ml antigen-purified hPrp17 antibodies and 1:3000 dilution of mouse anti-SC35 monoclonal antibody (Sigma); and secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit IgG coupled to rhodamine and anti-mouse IgG coupled to fluorescein. Images were photographed using an Axioskop (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), and color photographs were processed using PHOTOSHOP software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). A search of GenBankTM was performed to identify a putative human homolog of S. cerevisiae Prp17p (scPrp17p), and PCR was used to isolate a full-length cDNA. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 579 amino acids, and sequence alignment of hPrp17 and yeast scPrp17p revealed an identity of 35% and similarity of 44% (Fig. 1). ProbableSchizosaccharomyces pombe (sp) and Caenorhabditis elegans (ce) homologs of Prp17p were also identified in GenBankTM (Fig. 1). spPrp17 and cePrp17 are 41 and 51% identical to hPrp17, respectively, and 37 and 36% identical to scPrp17p. We also found EST sequences for portions of probable mouse, rat, drosophila, rice, and pine Prp17 homologs (data not shown). The highest conservation between the Prp17 proteins lies in the carboxyl-terminal half, which contains seven WD repeats (Fig. 1). These domains are thought to adopt a propeller-like structure, as was previously demonstrated for the prototypical member of the WD-protein family, β-transducin (24Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 25Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 26Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The members of the large family of WD repeat proteins are involved in diverse functions such as signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal assembly, and cell cycle control. Many proteins with WD repeats form multi-protein complexes, and thus it has been proposed that these repeats promote protein-protein interactions (27Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that another yeast splicing factor, Prp4, and its mammalian homolog, U4/U6–60 kDa protein, also contain seven WD repeats (28Lauber J. Plessel G. Prehn S. Will C.L. Fabrizio P. Groning K. Lane W.S. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1997; 3: 926-941PubMed Google Scholar). Prp4 promotes the interaction between the U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs, and has been proposed to be required for the conformational change that occurs in the spliceosome before the first step of splicing (29Ayadi L. Miller M. Banroques J. RNA. 1997; 3: 197-209PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, Prp17 may perform a similar function during the conformational change that occurs before the second step of splicing. To determine whether hPrp17 is functionally conserved, we used a yeast strain in which PRP17 had been deleted (Δprp17) (6Jones M.H. Frank D.N. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9687-9691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to examine whether expressing the human gene could rescue the observed temperature-sensitive phenotype. We expressed the vector alone (pG1) full-length yeast PRP17 sequence (pG1-yPRP17), yeastPRP17, which is truncated at amino acid 149 (pG1-yPRP17ΔC), or the full-length human sequence (pG1-hPRP17) in the WT and Δprp17 strains. We compared growth of these yeast at four different temperatures (Fig. 2 and data not shown). As expected, the WT strain containing pG1 and the Δprp17 strain containing pG1-yPRP17 grow well at all the temperatures tested (Fig. 2). However, the Δprp17 strain containing the vector alone or the truncated yeast gene (pG1-yPRP17ΔC) grows slowly at 24 and 30 °C and does not grow at higher temperatures (Fig. 2). Significantly, the Δprp17 strain containing pG1-hPRP17 does grow at 24, 30, and 34 °C but not at 37 °C (Fig. 2). This indicates that hPrp17 can partially rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype in the Δprp17 strain. We next wanted to test whether hPrp17 could rescue the splicing defects observed in vitro and in vivo in the Δprp17 strain. We made extracts from the yeast strains used above for complementation. A time course was performed of in vitrosplicing of actin pre-mRNA with these extracts at 23 °C (Fig. 3 A). The efficiency of the second step is represented as the amount of second step products (LP + mRNA) divided by the total amount of splicing intermediates and products (LI + LP + mRNA + 5′-exon) (Fig. 3 B). Extract from the knockout strain expressing yPrp17 splices similarly to the WT extract (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–8). Splicing with the knockout strain containing the vector alone results in the accumulation of splicing intermediates (LI + 5′-exon) relative to splicing products (LP + mRNA), indicating a partial block to the second step (Fig. 3 A, lanes 9–12; note that lane 12 is underloaded on this gel). Significantly, expressing hPrp17 in the knockout strain increases the efficiency of the second step (Fig. 3,A, lanes 13–16 and B); therefore, hPrp17 can partially rescue the in vitro splicing defect seen in the knockout strain, which correlates with its ability to partially complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype in vivo. When we looked at the in vivo splicing of RP51A and actin, the primary defect of the PRP17 knockout was the reduction of mRNA, and no preferential accumulation of unspliced precursor or lariat intermediates (data not shown). This phenotype was previously reported for the ts allele prp17-100 (30Xu D. Field D.J. Tang S.-J. Moris A. Bobechko B.P. Friesen J.D Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and may result if inhibition of the second step of splicing destabilizes the splicing intermediates. Another possibility is that mutations in PRP17 or deletion of this gene affects the stability of mature RNA. Expression of yPrp17 in the knockout strain does rescue this phenotype, and expression of hPrp17 partially rescues it (data not shown). These results are again consistent with the partial complementation of the knockout strain. To investigate the role of hPrp17 in mammalian cells, we raised antibodies to peptides corresponding to amino acids 129–144 of hPrp17. After affinity purification, these antibodies specifically detected a 65-kDa protein, the predicted molecular mass of hPrp17, on Western blots of HeLa nuclear extracts (data not shown). These antibodies were used to determine the cellular localization of hPrp17 in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). Immunostaining analysis revealed that hPrp17 is present in discrete regions in the nucleus (Fig. 4, A and B). Colocalization studies using antibodies to the splicing factor SC35 (23Fu X.-D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, C and D) revealed that these regions correspond to the nuclear speckles that are enriched in splicing components (18Spector D.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 265-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). hPrp17 probably does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm because both hPrp17 and SC35 remained localized to the nuclear speckles after treatment of the cells with actinomycin D (data not shown). The nuclear shuttling protein hnRNP A1 (31Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) was localized to the nucleus before actinomycin D treatment and had both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization after treatment (data not shown). Localization of hPrp17 in the nuclear speckles suggests that, as in yeast, hPrp17 may also function as a splicing factor in humans. Together with previous complementation experiments, these results suggest that the mechanism of the second step is conserved between yeast and humans. Zhou and Reed (17Zhou Z. Reed R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have shown that a yeast-human chimeric Prp16 protein could rescue a PRP16 knockout strain, but the full-length hPrp16 could not. Expression of hPrp18 does not rescue the yeast PRP18 knockout, but yeast Prp18p can partially complement hPrp18-depleted splicing extract in vitro (16Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The yeast protein Prp22p has been shown to play a role in the second step as well as later in spliceosome disassembly (32Schwer B. Gross C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,33Company M. Arenas J. Abelson J. Nature. 1991; 349: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and the human homolog of Prp22p, HRH1, can partially rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype caused by theprp22-1 allele (34Ono Y. Ohno M. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7611-7620Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, judging by a strict requirement of complementation of a yeast knockout strain, hPrp17 may be the most functionally conserved second step factor. The partial rescue is highly significant because the only human homolog of a splicing factor that has been reported to completely rescue a yeast knockout is the snRNP core protein D1 (35Rymond B.C. Rokeach L.A. Soch S.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3501-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In summary, the results presented here provide strong evidence that hPrp17 is indeed a functional homolog of the yeast splicing factor, Prp17p. Our results, showing that hPrp17 is concentrated in nuclear speckles in HeLa cells, together with previously reported results that hPrp17 associates with purified spliceosomes (17Zhou Z. Reed R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggest that hPrp17 functions as a splicing factor in humans.

These results indicate that MPP recognizes a higher order structure of extension peptides. There are conflicting results concerning the substrate binding of MPP. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence study on NeurosporaMPP demonstrated that both subunits of MPP can bind substrates with the dissociation constants of the order of sub-μm (22Boteva R. Salvato B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In yeast MPP, cross-linking and surface plasmon resonance analyses showed that α-MPP, but not β-MPP, binds substrates as efficiently as does the MPP complex (23Yang M. Géli V. Oppliger W. Suda K. James P. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6416-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Luciano P. Geoffroy S. Brandt A. Hernandez J.F. Geli V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Which subunit functions for substrate recognition has remained to be determined. To investigate the subunit responsible for substrate recognition in yeast MPP, we used the fluorescence-labeled peptides. A coumarin derivative, which is an environment-sensitive fluorescence probe, was covalently introduced into the synthetic peptides based on the malate dehydrogenase precursor. The dissociation constants of MPP and the subunits with the fluorescent-labeled peptide were determined by fluorescence emission intensity. We report here that MPP can bind the substrate peptides with high affinity but only in the dimeric complex and that individual subunit interacts with different parts of the extension peptide of precursor protein. A hexahistidine tag was introduced into the C termini of yeast α- and β-MPP using the polymerase chain reaction method. The resultant cDNAs were inserted into pET3d vector, leading to pET-αHis and pET-βHis. For co-expression of yeast MPP subunits, a T7 promoter/nontagged β-MPP cassette was inserted in tandem into pET-αHis. The resulting construct, pET-αHis-β, contained the histidine-tagged α-MPP and nontagged β-MPP under the T7 promoters. BL21(DE3) strain transformed with each plasmid was cultured for 24 h at 25 °C and then harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min. After sonication of the harvested cells, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant supernatant was loaded on a 1-ml nickel trap-chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.01% Tween 20). The column was washed with 10 ml of the buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and then with 10 ml of the buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. The hexahistidine-tagged proteins were eluted using buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. The purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Peptides were synthesized using an EPS221 economy peptide synthesizer (ABIMED Analysen-Teknik GmbH, Germany), employing Fmoc (N-α-9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) strategy. After acetylation of the α-amino group of the N-terminal amino acid with acetic anhydride, deprotection, cleavage of the peptides from the resin, and purification by reverse phase HPLC were performed as described (17Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified peptides were labeled with 7-diethylaminocoumarin (DAC) at the ε-amino group of lysine residue in the C-terminal portion of the peptides (see Fig. 1 A and Table I). The reaction was conducted in 100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 40% dimethylformamide, 1 mm succinimidyl ester of DAC, and 0.1 mg/ml peptide for 2 h at 25 °C. After precipitation of the peptide by adding 10 volumes of acetonitrile, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, washed twice with acetonitrile, and then dissolved in distilled water. The coumarin-labeled peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC on an Asahipak C4P-50 column (Asahi Chemical Industry, Japan) and dissolved in 50% aqueous dimethylformamide. Concentration of the fluorescence peptides was calculated from the absorbance of the DAC at 430 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 40,000.Table IEffect on affinity of MPP of replacement of proximal and distal arginines of substrates with alaninesPeptideSequenceK dμmDAC-MDH5–25Ac-LARPVGAALRRS-FSTSAQNK(ε-DAC)A0.13DAC-MDH14AAc-LARPVGAALARS-FSTSAQNK(ε-DAC)A0.21DAC-MDH15AAc-LARPVGAALRAS-FSTSAQNK(ε-DAC)A1.56DAC-MDH7AAc-LAAPVGAALRRS-FSTSAQNK(ε-DAC)A1.75DAC-MDH14A15AAc-LARPVGAALAAS-FSTSAQNK(ε-DAC)A7.26Derivatives of the extension peptide of rat MDH precursor were fluorescently labeled with DAC at the ε-amino group of lysine in the peptides.

The hyphen indicates the cleavage site by MPP. The replaced arginines and alanines are indicated by single and double underlines, respectively. The titration experiments were carried out using 1 μm purified recombinant yeast MPP and 0–2 μm of the DAC-labeled MDH peptides. The dissociation constants were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fluorescence was measured at 25 °C using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Excitation was at 390 nm, and the emission intensity was measured at 470 nm. For binding assay, the purified α-MPP, β-MPP, and MPP complex were preincubated with 5 mm EDTA on ice for 30 min. Proteins of a fixed concentration (see legends to tables and figures) were diluted into 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 30% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA, then the coumarin-labeled peptides of indicated concentrations were added. After each sample and the blank had been thoroughly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 1–2 min, the emission spectra were taken, and the fluorescence intensity at 470 nm was read. The dissociation constant, K d, and binding stoichiometry, n, were determined from Scatchard analysis of the data, as follows: 1/(1 − F/F max) = 1/K d(L/(F/F max) −nE). In this equation, F and F max are the measured and maximal fluorescence intensity of the peptides, respectively, and L and E are the total peptide and enzyme concentration, respectively.F max was obtained by fitting the saturation curve to a rectangular hyperbola. A plot of 1/(1 −F/F max) versusL/(F/F max) yields a linear function with a slope of 1/K d and an abscissa intercept of nE. In the competition experiments, fluorescence of DAC-MDH5–25 was measured in the presence of various concentrations of nonlabeled peptides. In the fluorescence quenching analysis, after the binding reaction done as described above, various concentrations (0–40 mm final) of acrylamide as external quencher were added to sample solutions. For steady-state collisional quenching of the fluorescence, a linear plot was obtained when the data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation, (F o/F) − 1=K sv[Q], where F o is the initial net fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher,F is the net fluorescence intensity in the presence of quencher, K sv is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and [Q] is the quencher concentration. To monitor substrate binding of the MPP and the subunits, a coumarin derivative was introduced to the peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 21 amino acids (Leu5 to Ala25; Asn24 was replaced with Lys to introduce the coumarin fluorophore) of rat malate dehydrogenase (MDH) precursor, as shown in Fig. 1 A. Yeast MPP was obtained from co-purification of the C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged α-MPP with the nontagged β-MPP by nickel-chelating column. The purified MPP was confirmed to be an equal stoichiometry of both subunits by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration and had the same kinetic parameters, K m and k cat, as the native enzyme (data not shown). The coumarin-labeled peptide (DAC-MDH5–25) gave a fluorescence emission spectrum with the maximum at 482 nm (Fig. 1 B, spectrum1). The addition of the purified MPP, which was inactivated in the presence of EDTA, led to a large increase in fluorescence intensity and a blue shift in emission spectrum (emission maximum at 470 nm) (Fig. 1 B, spectrum 2). When the coumarin-labeled peptide was added to the MPP in the absence of EDTA, the increased fluorescence rapidly disappeared to the level seen with the peptide alone (Fig. 1 B, spectrum 3). The processed peptides obtained after incubation of DAC-MDH5–25 with a small amount of the active enzyme gave no change in the fluorescence spectrum (data not shown). These observations are interpreted to mean that the increase in the fluorescence occurs through a the specific interaction of the precursor peptide with MPP and that this interaction is lost with processing of the peptide. The titration of MPP with DAC-MDH5–25 showed a simple saturation curve (Fig. 2). The inset in the figure shows the Scatchard plot of the data, from which the dissociation constant, K d, was calculated to be 0.13 ± 0.07 μm, as the inverse of the slope. The molar ratio of the peptide to MPP was determined to be 0.83 ± 0.09, suggesting a stoichiometric binding of the peptide to the enzyme. Our earlier study using synthetic MDH peptides (17Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the arginine residue at position −2 and those distant from the cleavage point are important for cleavage by the MPP. To confirm the specific binding of the fluorescence-labeled peptides to the MPP, we examined the interactions of MPP with DAC-MDH5–25 derivatives (TableI), in which arginine residues were replaced with alanine. DAC-MDH7A, in which the distal Arg7of the MDH extension peptide was altered to alanine, gave about a 15-fold increase in the K d value. DAC-MDH14A, in which the arginine residue at position −3 from the cleavage site was replaced by alanine, showed substantially the sameK d value as that of DAC-MDH5–25. On the other hand, DAC-MDH15A, which lacks the arginine at position −2, gave about a 12-fold increase in the K d value. DAC-MDH14A15A, with a double substitution of alanines for arginine residues at positions −2 and −3, showed more than a 50-fold-less affinity than that of the wild type. Compared with the K m value of MDH1–25 (0.71 μm) in the cleavage reaction (17Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), those of MDH7A, MDH14A, MDH15A, and MDH14A15A were 8.7-fold (6.2 μm), 1.8-fold (1.3 μm), 1.8-fold (1.3 μm), and 47.9-fold (34 μm), respectively. The absolute values of the K m reported previously were about 5-fold larger than those of K d because of differences in salt concentrations in the reaction medium. The affinity of the enzyme for substrates is markedly affected by the salt concentration, and the K m value at 10 mmNaCl is about 10 times lower than that at 100 mm. 2K. Kojima, S. Kitada, K. Shimokata, T. Ogishima, and A. Ito, unpublished results. For enzyme assays in the previous experiments, we used a large amount of the diluted enzyme solution eluted from columns with high salts, whereas contamination of salts was negligible in the present experiment because we used an extremely high concentration of the recombinant enzyme. Thus, a similar response to amino acid substitution betweenK d and K m indicates that the distal and proximal arginine residues directly participate in substrate binding of MPP. This method using a fluorescence-labeled peptide allows one to estimate the affinity of MPP for substrates. To determine which subunit is responsible for binding of the substrate, each subunit that was tagged with hexahistidines at the C terminus was individually purified using a nickel-chelating column. They reconstituted the enzyme activity when mixed together, although α-MPP required the addition of 30% glycerol to prevent aggregation. When the fluorescence change was measured at the peptide concentration of 1 μm, the spectra with α- and β-MPP alone were relatively small (Fig. 1 B, spectrum 4 and spectrum 5, respectively) compared with the MPP complex (Fig. 1 B, spectrum 1), thereby suggesting the low affinity of subunits for the substrate. The fluorescence intensity at 470 nm increased with increasing concentrations of the peptide, although the intensity for both subunits did not reach the maximum level even at 5 μm peptide (Fig. 3). The K d values for α- and β-MPP were determined to be 4.38 ± 0.75 and 4.45 ± 0.60 μm, respectively, from the Scatchard analysis of the data (Fig. 3, insets). Thus, the affinities of α- and β-MPP for the substrate are about 30-fold lower than that of the MPP complex. The results indicate that only the MPP complex can bind substrates with high affinity. The molar ratio of the peptide to α- and β-subunit were calculated to be 0.92 ± 0.12 and 0.83 ± 0.09, respectively, suggesting specific interaction of the peptide to each subunit, although with low affinity. The interaction of each subunit with the peptides that lack the distal and proximal arginines was too weak to detect a change of the coumarin fluorescence in the titration experiment. Therefore, the affinities of the subunit monomers with these mutant peptides were estimated by competition between DAC-MDH5–25 and the nonlabeled mutant peptides in binding to each subunit. In the experiment, MDH7A14A was used as a substrate lacking distal arginine, instead of MDH7A, to eliminate the effect of the number of positive charges in the peptides, because the replacement of arginine residue at position 14 had little effect on binding of the peptide to the MPP (Table I). Fig. 4 A shows the titration of β-MPP with DAC-MDH5–25 in the presence of 0 to 75 μmcompetitor peptide, nonlabeled MDH7A14A. The apparentK d values of the subunit for DAC-MDH5–25 were obtained from titration curves at various concentrations of the competitors. The K d value for the competitor peptide could be determined from a plot of the apparent K dvalues for the labeled peptide in the presence of the competitorversus the concentration of the competitor peptide, and the plot was reasonably linear (Fig. 4 B). When nonlabeled wild-type peptide was used as the competitor, the calculatedK d values for α-MPP (4.4 μm) and β-MPP (3.6 μm) were substantially the same as those obtained by the direct binding assay described above. TheK d value of MDH7A14A for β-MPP was determined to be 43 μm (Fig. 4 B), which is about 10 times higher than that of the wild-type peptide. This mutant peptide, however, exhibited practically no inhibition to the binding of DAC-MDH5–25 to α-MPP even at 5 mm. On the other hand, the K d values of MDH14A15A for binding to α- and β-MPP were determined to be 0.46 and 2.67 mm, respectively, indicating that the mutant peptide has more than 100 and 500 times less affinity to α- and β-subunits, respectively, than MDH5–25. These findings mean that substrate binding with the individual subunits as well as with the whole enzyme (Table I) depends on the presence of the proximal and distal arginines, although dependence varies with the subunits and position of arginines. Thus, α-MPP appears to participate in the interaction with distal arginine residue of the extension peptide, whereas β-MPP seems to be more responsible for interaction with proximal arginine. The difference in the binding state of peptides between the MPP complex and each subunit was revealed by the quenching of coumarin fluorescence by acrylamide. After binding of the peptide to the MPP complex and the subunits, increasing concentrations of acrylamide were added, and the fluorescence change was measured at 470 nm. Fig. 5 shows the Stern-Volmer quenching plots, and the quenching constants, Ksv, were calculated to be 1.1 ± 0.4, 8.7 ± 0.6, and 9.1 ± 1.3m−1, for the MPP complex, α-, and β-subunit, respectively. The results indicate that the local environment around the substrate peptide bound to the MPP complex differs from that for each subunit and that in the MPP complex the coumarin fluorophore is partially buried in the enzyme, whereas the one in the subunit is fully exposed to the solvent. We presented evidence that MPP can bind the substrate peptides with high affinity but only in the dimeric complex. MPP has an affinity of the dissociation constant of about 0.13 μm to the peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 21 amino acids of rat MDH precursor, whereas each subunit has about a 30-fold less affinity than the dimeric complex. The study using surface plasmon resonance, however, showed that α-MPP bound a substrate with the same affinity as the MPP complex and that the K d value to the immobilized peptide was determined to be 0.2 μm (24Luciano P. Geoffroy S. Brandt A. Hernandez J.F. Geli V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We obtained similar results showing no clear difference in the affinity between the MPP complex and each subunit, based on the experiments on surface plasmon resonance and on affinity purification of the enzyme using the peptide ligand bound to the Sepharose resin.2Because our fluorescence-quenching analysis demonstrated that the peptide bound to the MPP was buried in the enzyme, the finding that theK d value for the MPP complex is similar to that for individual subunits in these experiments was probably because of steric interference by immobilization of the peptides to the dextran matrix on the sensor chip or Sepharose resin. These findings indicate that dimer formation of the two subunits of MPP is essential for substrate binding. We also demonstrated that the individual subunit required arginines at different positions in the peptide for binding, although their affinities were much lower than that of MPP. Because β-MPP has a catalytic center (12Kitada S. Shimokata K. Niidome T. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1148-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the subunit appears to interact with amino acid residues around a scissile bond of the precursor, including proximal arginine at position −2. The interaction between β-MPP and the proximal arginine seems to be more responsible for the initial binding step of substrates to the enzyme rather than the catalytic reaction, because mutation of the proximal arginine caused a drastic increase in the K m value but not much effect in theV max value (17Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-MPP may also interact with the upper region, distal to the cleavage site, of the extension peptide. The lack of the distal arginine of the MDH extension peptide led to an increase in the K d value to this subunit (Table II). Moreover, mutation of Glu79 in rat β-MPP, which is a residue within the conserved acidic amino acid cluster in β-MPP, decreased the interaction of substrate peptide fluorescent-labeled at the N-terminal portion with this subunit (28Kitada S. Kojima K. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32547-32553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is likely that α-MPP is responsible for the interaction with the upper region of the extension peptide. The present data showed that distal arginine was indispensable for binding of the peptide to α-MPP. We recently found that substitution of the conserved acidic amino acid residues in α-MPP (Glu353 and Glu377/Asp378in yeast α-MPP) on the processing of the precursor protein was more effective with a longer extension peptide (25Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25158-25163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, individual subunits interact with different parts of the extension peptide of the precursor protein.Table IIDissociation constants of α- and β-MPP monomer with peptides lacking proximal and distal argininesPeptideK dα-MPPβ-MPPmmAc-MDH5–250.00440.0036Ac-MDH7A14A>5.00.043Ac-MDH14A15A0.462.7Competition between DAC-MDH5–25 and the nonlabeled peptides were performed, and the dissociation constants were calculated, as described in the legend to Fig. 4.

Ac-MDH7A14A replaced Arg7 and Arg14 with alanine in the MDH extension peptide. The sequences of Ac-MDH5–25 and Ac-MDH14A15A are shown in Table I. The dissociation constant of α-MPP to Ac-MDH7A14A gives a minimum value, because no competition was observed even at 5 mm mutant peptide. The subunits of the MPP are homologous to the core proteins of mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome oxidoreductase (bc1complex), a component of the respiratory chain. The crystal structure of the bc1 complex from bovine heart mitochondria has been determined (26Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J.

Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), and one can expect that MPP is similar in structure to the bovine core 1 and core 2 complex. Core 1 and 2 proteins are structurally similar and consist of two domains of roughly equal size with almost identical folding topology. The two bowls representing these proteins were described as coming together in the form of a ball with a crack leading to the internal cavity. From the available data, the middle portion of core 2, which corresponds to the glycine-rich region of α-MPP conserved among many species, is close to a site of core 1 that corresponds to the zinc binding site of β-MPP. These regions might cooperatively form the active site that recognizes the proximal arginine and catalyzes cleavage reaction. In conclusion, the two subunits of MPP cooperatively form the substrate binding pocket and recognize different structural elements in the extension peptide, including the proximal and distal arginine residues. Individual subunit monomers can interact with distinct structural elements, although with low affinity, and complex formation with the two subunits leads the enzyme to have higher affinity for substrates, the results both of induced structural change at the interface between the two and increase in binding sites. Recognition of the precursors at multiple subsites in MPP make it possible to render strict specificity and high affinity to the enzyme for precursors with structures little in common."

Recently, crystals of an inactive D64N mutant were obtained under conditions identical to those used for the native enzyme. Data were collected at different pH values and in the presence of divalent cations. Data were also collected at low pH for the crystals of the native ASV IN core domain. In the structures of native ASV IN at pH 6.0 and below, as well as in all structures of the D64N mutants, the side chain of the active site residue Asx-64 (Asx denotes Asn or Asp) is rotated by ∼150° around the Cα—Cβ bond, compared with the structures at higher pH. In the new structures, this residue makes hydrogen bonds with the amide group of Asn-160, and thus, the usual metal-binding site, consisting of Asp-64, Asp-121, and Glu-157, is disrupted. Surprisingly, however, a single Zn2+ can still bind to Asp-121 in the mutant, without restoration of the activity of the enzyme. These structures have elucidated an unexpected mechanism of inactivation of the enzyme by lowering the pH or by mutation, in which a protonated side chain of Asx-64 changes its orientation and interaction partner.

Integrase (IN)1 (1Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) is one of only four enzymes encoded by retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and avian sarcoma virus (ASV), and it is absolutely essential for the support of the viral life cycle. For these reasons, IN is currently a target for the design of antiretroviral drugs. Retroviral INs contain approximately 300 amino acids, organized into three domains: zinc-binding N terminus, catalytic core domain, and DNA-binding C terminus. IN catalyzes the incorporation of the reverse-transcribed viral DNA into the host genome in two steps, processing and joining (1Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 2Vink C. Plasterk R.H. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 433-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Goff S.P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), both of which involve a nucleophilic attack by a hydroxyl group on a DNA phosphate. In the processing step, a water molecule attacks near the end of the viral DNA, two nucleotides from the 3′-ends of both viral DNA strands. In the joining step, the exposed viral DNA deoxyribose 3′-OH is activated to attack the host DNA at a relatively nonspecific location, thereby inserting viral DNA into the host genome. In vitro, these reactions require only virus-like DNA, IN, and metal cations. Although the isolated ASV IN catalytic core domain is defective for the processing and joining activities, it retains two activities: disintegration, the reverse of the joining step that uses a preformed DNA substrate, and an endonuclease activity that cleaves between the highly conserved C and A (−3 activity) at the termini of the viral DNA (CATT-3′) (4Kulkosky J. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The endonuclease activity is distinct from the normal processing activity of IN, which cleaves between the A and T (−2 activity). Both the endonuclease and disintegration activities of the catalytic domain are dependent on the D, D(35)E catalytic triad, corresponding to Asp-64, Asp-121, and Glu-157 in ASV IN, and an exogenous metal cation (5Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The biological relevance of the 3′-endonuclease and disintegration activities is unclear; however, both activities are useful for monitoring the function of the active site. In previous studies of the D, D(35)E motif, it was shown that conservative active site substitutions, such as Asp → Glu or Glu → Asp, reduced activity by 10-fold or more, and other substitutions, such as Asp → Ala, abolished it completely (5Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). These residues were therefore proposed to directly bind the required metal cofactors. Later studies showed that divalent cations, such as Ca2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, are tightly bound by Asp-64, Asp-121, or Glu-157 in the ASV IN active site, although only the last two cations support full catalytic activity (6Bujacz G.

The central residue of the metal-binding triad is Asp-64, which together with Asp-121 forms metal-binding site I, and with Glu-157 forms binding site II. It is clear from the nearly perfect coordination distances of metal cations (2.0–2.2 Å for O … Mn2+) that any substitution of the active site residues would disrupt metal binding by displacing the acidic oxygens. Binding studies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 IN and ASV IN with an inhibitor targeted against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 IN showed comparable inhibition effects, but the crystal structure of an inhibitor-catalytic core domain complex was determined only for ASV IN (8Lubkowski J. Yang F. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Zhao H. Burke Jr., T.R. Neamati N. Pommier Y. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One interesting observation during that study was the rotation of the side chain of the central acidic residue, Asp-64, around the Cα—Cβ bond. We hypothesized that this change resulted not directly from inhibitor binding, but rather from the decrease of the pH of the mother liquor caused by addition of the inhibitor. This interpretation was supported by the fact that although the inhibitor also bound to IN at a higher pH, a similar rotation of the side chain of Asp-64 was not observed. In the experiments carried out at lower pH, the structural transition was determined to be between 5.5 and 5.6,i.e. near the pK a of the carboxylic acid group of the aspartate side chain. In this paper, we report the structural basis of the inactivation of the ASV IN catalytic core domain resulting from a single conservative active site mutation (D64N), as well as from the decrease of pH, and we correlate the inactivation with the ability of the enzyme to bind divalent cations. The endonuclease activity of the catalytic core domain was assayed as described previously, using 10 mmMnCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C (9Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The following buffer systems were used: CHES, Tris, MOPS, MES, and acetate, providing a pH range of 4.3–9.8. Crystals of both the catalytic core domain of ASV IN, and the core domain D64N mutant, ASVIN64 (definitions of the abbreviations for different crystals described in this report are given in Table I), were obtained under identical conditions, described previously (9Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, citrate buffer was used to adjust the pH of the crystallization medium to 6.0. Before the x-ray experiments, some ASV IN crystals were transferred stepwise to synthetic mother liquor solutions with gradually decreasing pH. The pH value of the final soaking solution for these crystals was 5.0. Therefore, “low pH” is used throughout this paper to refer to these crystals and the structures that originated from them. Whenever soaking was accompanied by the addition of divalent cations, acetate buffer was used instead of citrate buffer at an equivalent concentration and pH. In this manner, some of the ASVIN64 crystals were first transferred to acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and then soaked in the presence of Mn2+, Zn2+, or Mg2+ for several days. All soaking experiments were performed at 4 °C.Table IKey to the identification of the crystals of ASV IN catalytic core domainKeyDefinition of proteinpH of crystal growth or soaking solution used prior the data collection (buffer identity and concentration)Identity and concentration of metal cationASVIN64(Core) mutant D64N6.0, citrate buffer, 0.1 mNoneASVIN64Mg(Core) mutant D64N6.0, acetate buffer, 0.1 mMgCl2, 0.1mASVIN64Mn(Core) mutant D64N6.0, acetate buffer, 0.1 mMnCl2, 0.1 mASVIN64Zn(Core) mutant D64N6.0, acetate buffer, 0.1mZnCl2, 0.1 mASVIN5ASVIN core5.0, acetate or citrate buffer, 0.1mNone Open table in a new tab For the x-ray diffraction experiments with the low pH crystals, we selected those soaked in the absence of divalent cations (ASVIN5) and those soaked in the presence of 0.1 m MnCl2.

Diffraction data for all crystals were collected at room temperature using CuKα radiation generated by a rotating-anode Nonius FR591 generator operated at 45 kV and 95 mA and were recorded on a DIP2020 image plate detector.

Open table in a new tab The refinement of all structures was carried out with the program X-PLOR (11Brünger A. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The structure of ASV IN deposited at the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1asv was used as the starting model. This structure corresponds to the crystals grown in the presence of citrate buffer (9Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); therefore, we considered it to be the most relevant to this study. Before the initial rigid body refinement was performed, we removed all solvent molecules from the model, as well as residues 144–152, which form a part of the flexible active site loop. The side chain of Asp-64 beyond Cβ was also removed. The refinement protocol was cross-validated by the free R-factor index (12Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3853) Google Scholar), calculated for ∼10% of all reflections, which were excluded from the refinement. Rigid body refinement at the resolution range 3.0–8.0 Å was carried out to compensate for small differences in the unit cell parameters. This step was followed by the positional and overall B-factor refinements. After visual inspection of the structures with the programs O (13Jones T.A. Kieldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) or Chain (14Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 244-245Crossref Google Scholar) and their manual corrections, the resolution of the data was extended and the B-factors were refined individually for all non-hydrogen atoms. At the final stages of the refinement, water molecules, as well as metal cations, if present, were positioned as indicated by appropriate peaks in the difference electron density maps. The missing fragments of the protein chain were also reconstructed, whenever possible, on the basis of the electron density (e.g. for the side chain of residue 64). The quality of the geometrical and stereochemical indices was continuously monitored during refinement with the program PROCHECK (15Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The refinement statistics and quality assessments are shown in Table II. In all the structures discussed here (except that of the ASV IN catalytic core soaked at pH 5.0 in the presence of Mn2+), we observed a similar conformation of the side chain of residue 64, which was different from the one reported previously (5Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In the previously reported structures of ASV IN (6Bujacz G. Jaskólski M.

Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), with the sole exception of the low pH complexes with an inhibitor (8Lubkowski J. Yang F. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Zhao H. Burke Jr., T.R. Neamati N. Pommier Y. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the side chain of Asp-64 points toward the side chain of Asp-121, forming hydrogen bonds mediated by a water molecule (or a metal ion). The difference F o − F c electron density extending from Cβ of residue 64 unambiguously indicates that the Asx-64 side chain (Asn in the mutant ASVIN64 or Asp in ASVIN5) is rotated by ∼150° around the Cα—Cβ bond (Fig. 1 A), compared with the standard orientation (Fig. 1 B). In the structures reported here, Asx-64 forms two strong hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asn-160. In the case of the mutant, introduction of the amide group to the side chain of residue 64 opens the possibility of the formation of two hydrogen bonds (N-H … O distances of 2.8–3.0 Å) with the amide group of Asn-160. Because the charged side chain of Asp-64 could not participate in equivalent hydrogen bonds, its conformation in the structure of ASVIN5 can be explained by the predominant presence of the protonated form under these experimental conditions. In the structure of the low pH ASV IN derived from the crystals soaked in the presence of Mn2+, the difference electron density indicates the native orientation (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, for this structure we can also identify an electron density peak corresponding to the Mn2+ bound to the primary metal-binding site of ASV IN (6Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the presence of divalent metal cations (Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) at 0.1m concentration in the solutions did not alter the conformation of the Asn-64 side chain in the mutant (Fig. 1 A). As described above, ASV IN was capable of binding Mn2+ even at low pH, by repositioning of the Asp-64 side chain to the native orientation. Similar experiments performed with crystals of the mutant D64N (crystals ASVIN64Mn and ASVIN64Mg) did not indicate any binding of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ (data not shown). In the case of crystals soaked in 0.1 m ZnCl2(ASVIN64Zn), we observed a single, very clear peak in the positiveF o − F c density at 2.07 Å from an OD atom of Asp-121 (Fig. 2 A). This peak could be interpreted only as a Zn2+ bound to the single active site residue. We did not observe the second Zn2+ previously reported bound between the side chains of Asp-64 and Glu-157 (Fig. 2 B) (7Bujacz G. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Andrake M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18161-18168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Two additional zinc-binding sites, located away from the active site, were also previously reported in the structure of ASV IN with Zn2+. In the case of D64N IN, we also observed Zn2+ in close proximity to His-103, corresponding to site III reported for the native ASV IN. We were unable to locate another Zn2+ at site IV between His-198 and Tyr-194 (7Bujacz G. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Andrake M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18161-18168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In none of the structures reported here were we able to trace completely the active site loop (residues 144–154), due to the poor quality of the electron density in this area. In some structures (ASVIN64 and ASVIN5), interpretable electron density covered residues 144–146 and 153–154. The overall trace was quite apparent, although the quality of the electron density indicated the highly dynamic character of these residues; therefore, their precise conformation could be questioned. Similarly to our previous observations (8Lubkowski J. Yang F. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Zhao H. Burke Jr., T.R. Neamati N. Pommier Y. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the tracing of the visible part of this loop is different from the conformations described in our first report (9Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the loop conformation cannot be completed with the currently available data. Having observed pH-dependent differences in the conformation of the Asp-64 side chain, we next investigated the effect of pH on the endonuclease activity of the catalytic core domain. We previously reported that the optimal pH for the full-length wild type ASV IN was ∼9 (16Muller B. Jones K.S. Merkel G.W. Skalka A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11633-11637Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using the IN catalytic core domain as well as the full-length wild type IN protein, we carried out a standard assay for IN processing and endonuclease activity. The results show that the optimal pH for the processing activity of full-length IN is ∼8.5, which is generally consistent with the earlier results mentioned above (Fig. 3). The −3′ processing activity of the catalytic core also showed an optimal pH of ∼8.5. At pH 5, both proteins were essentially inactive. We therefore conclude that the pH activity profile is consistent with the observation that the Asp-64 side chain is repositioned at pH 5. The main goal of the studies described here was to understand the molecular basis for the mutations that inactivate the ASV IN catalytic core. The problem was approached via two series of experiments, namely by studies of the D64N mutant, and of the wild type core domain at a pH significantly lower than physiological. As shown previously (5Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), mutation of Asp-64 to Ala essentially inactivates the enzyme. Several structures of the conservative D64N mutant, reported here, clearly show disruption of the primary metal-binding site resulting from the rotation of the side chain of Asn-64. Both observed conformations of this side chain appear to be energetically favorable. In the first mode of binding, predominantly observed in the previously reported structures (6Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Bujacz G. Alexandratos J.

Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), Asp-64 is anchored by a hydrogen bond to a water molecule, which in turn is stabilized by an additional hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp-121. Because it was shown previously that this conformation of Asp-64 remains unchanged upon binding of several divalent metal cations, we refer to it as the “active” conformation. The ability of ASV IN to bind divalent cations with high affinity suggests that the side chains of both Asp-64 and Asp-121 are most likely present in their ionized forms at neutral pH. Therefore, the presence of a water molecule that is hydrogen bonded with the two side chains seems to be crucial for the stability of this conformation. In fact, in all of the structures of the ASV IN catalytic core reported previously, as well as in the structures presented here, this water molecule is completely structurally conserved, participating in hydrogen bonding interactions with several protein atoms. In addition to being involved in hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asp-64 and Asp-121, this water molecule also serves as a proton donor in the hydrogen bond with Thr-63(O) and as a proton acceptor in the hydrogen bond with Asp-121(N). Furthermore, it interacts, most likely by donating a proton, with Asp-121(OD1), and with either OD1 or NH2 of Gln-153. In the second conformation, observed for the D64N mutant, the side chain of Asn-64 interacts directly with the side chain of Asn-160. For the wild type ASV IN, the equivalent interaction may depend upon the protonation state of Asp-64. With a protonated aspartate, such a conformation would probably be quite favorable, as it would lead to formation of two strong hydrogen bonds, similar to the ones present in the D64N mutant. For an ionized aspartate, however, only one hydrogen bond could be formed, via protons of the amide group of Asn-160. Moreover, the carboxylate oxygen atom of the side chain of Asn-160 would be in a repulsive interaction with an oxygen of the carboxylate of Asp-64. The pH 5.0 structure is consistent with such a description, with the conformation of the side chain of Asp-64 identical to that found in the D64N mutant. On the basis of the current results we cannot postulate a unique Cβ—Cγ rotamer of the side chain of residue 64. The network of hydrogen bonds around the side chain of Asn-160 does not favor a specific rotamer in any of the available structures. Therefore, it is possible that within the pair of residues Asx-64 and Asn-160, the side chains are 2-fold disordered. A detailed description of the conformation of residue 64 might be a very important element in the understanding of the activity of this enzyme on a molecular basis. This is true because only the active conformation of ionized Asp-64 allows normal binding of divalent cations. Additional observations are related to the conformation of the flexible loop adjacent to the active site, comprising residues 144–154. This is the second time we noticed a loop conformation different from those described before (9Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), as previously reported for the structure of a complex between ASV IN and an inhibitor (8Lubkowski J. Yang F. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Zhao H. Burke Jr., T.R. Neamati N. Pommier Y. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Two principal factors, the orientation of residue 64 and the pH of the mother liquor in which crystals were grown or soaked, seem to be associated with the loop conformation. It is possible that residue 64 in its inactive conformation (such as in the mutant structure presented here) allows stabilization of the active site loop in a specific conformation. Furthermore, the protonation state of some loop residues or residues interacting with the loop might change when the pH drops, forming an environment that is suitable for the stabilization of a specific conformation. Recently, we collected ultra-high resolution x-ray data for ASV IN crystals grown under different conditions, and the preliminary results seem to support the possibilities described above. A conclusive analysis will be possible only after these new structures are completely refined."

We isolated a suppressor of a mutant eIF2B. The suppressor prevents efficient GCN4 mRNA translation due to inactivation of the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps31 and results in low amounts of mutant 40 S ribosomal subunits. Deletion of one of two genes encoding ribosomal protein Rps17 also reduces the amounts of 40 S subunits but does not suppress eIF2B mutations or prevent efficient GCN4 translation. Our findings show that Rps31-deficient ribosomes are altered in a way that decreases the eIF2B requirement and that the small ribosomal subunit mediates the effects of low eIF2B activity on cell viability and translational regulation in response to eIF2 phosphorylation.

In current models for protein synthesis, eIF21 associates with GTP and Met-tRNAiMet to form a ternary complex that joins the small ribosomal subunit with other initiation factors. The preinitiation complex binds to the 5′ end of mRNA and migrates downstream. Upon recognition of an AUG initiation codon eIF2-bound GTP is hydrolyzed, and eIF2 is discharged from the ribosome as an inactive eIF2-GDP complex that must be recycled by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B (1Merrick W.C.

Phosphorylation of the α subunit at Ser-51 converts eIF2 from an eIF2B substrate to an inhibitor. Mammalian eIF2(αP)-GDP binds eIF2B with a high affinity, but the bound GDP cannot be released, leading to a reduction in the rate of ternary complex formation. Yeast eIF2 phosphorylation increases the affinity for eIF2B and inhibits the GDP release (4Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of translational inhibition by eIF2 phosphorylation is conserved between yeast and mammals. The eIF2 kinase Gcn2 becomes activated in yeast cells starved for amino acids (2Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Google Scholar). In contrast to the overall rate of protein synthesis, the translational efficiency of GCN4 mRNA increases in starved cells. Gcn4 protein stimulates transcription of over 40 genes that are required for amino acid biosynthesis or tRNA charging (5Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar). Translational regulation of GCN4 mRNA is mediated by four uORFs. The first uORF is the least inhibitory and is required for the ability of ribosomes to bypass the translational barrier imposed by the remaining three uORFs (6Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A large amount of data supports a scanning-reinitiation model in which ribosomes translate the first uORF but remain mRNA-bound thereafter. While moving further downstream, reinitiation at the inhibitory uORF4 precludes subsequent reinitiation at GCN4. In amino acid-starved cells, the reduction in ternary complex levels is thought to delay rebinding of ternary complexes to ribosomes scanning downstream of uORF1. Consequently, many ribosomes bypass the inhibitory uORF4 before acquiring a ternary complex, thus permitting recognition of the GCN4 start codon and translation of the GCN4 uORF (5Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar, 7Abastado J.P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M.

The β, γ, δ, and ε subunits of yeast eIF2B encoded by GCD7, GCD1, GCD2, and GCD6, respectively, were identified as mutations that mimic the effect of eIF2 phosphorylation onGCN4 expression. Mutations in the α subunit Gcn3 and in the Gcd7 and Gcd2 subunits of eIF2B can make eIF2B insensitive to eIF2(αP) (8Hannig E.H. Williams N.P. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G.

To identify novel eIF2B interactions in vivo, revertants were selected from a yeast strain with a conditional lethal mutant eIF2B that causes constitutively high levels of GCN4 translation. A revertant was isolated that prevents both the lethality and efficient GCN4 translation. Suppression is due to a mutation in the small subunit ribosomal protein gene RPS31 (previous designations UBI3 and RPS27A), providing evidence for an in vivoinvolvement of the ribosome in eIF2 recycling. YCp50 is a low copy number shuttle vector carrying the URA3 gene as a selectable yeast marker and β-lactamase for selection in Escherichia coli (12Johnston M. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Sc4014 is a yeast-E. coli shuttle vector carrying the URA3 and GCD1 genes (13Hill D.E. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The twogcd1 mutant alleles pB336 and pB337 were constructed by inserting an 8-mer (5′ CAGATCTG 3′) or a 10-mer self-complementary oligonucleotide (5′ GAAGATCTTC 3′) into the unique PvuII site near the amino terminus in the protein-coding region of theGCD1 gene of Sc4014. GCN4-lacZ and GCN4 c-lacZ constructs on the yeast-E. coli shuttle plasmids p164 and p227, with and without the four GCN4 upstream AUG codons, respectively, are constructs that contain the GCN4 mRNA leader and the first 54 codons of the GCN4 protein coding sequence fused in frame to the bacterial lacZ gene (6Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). TheGCN4 1 -lacZ and GCN4 1/4-lacZ constructs on plasmids p209 and pM99 contain as the sole upstream reading frame either wild-type uORF1 (p209; see Ref. 6Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G.

Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) were stored frozen at −70 °C until needed. Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli by the alkaline lysis method (17Birnboim H.D. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from yeast cells and separated electrophoretically on a 0.8% agarose gel. Amounts of RNA were adjusted by comparing ethidium bromide-induced fluorescence of ribosomal RNA under UV illumination. The ratios of rRNA were evaluated by computer analysis of the fluorescence intensity of individual bands using the program ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics). rRNA ratios of 4 rps31 stains were averaged and compared with the average ratios of 4 RPS31 strains, with a standard deviation of 15% between the individual determinations. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary blotting. A 3.5-kilobase pair EcoRI restriction fragment from p227 DNA that containedGCN4-lacZ fusion sequences was isolated using the Prep A Gene DNA purification matrix kit (Bio-Rad). DNA (40 ng) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using an oligo-labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated nucleotides on 1-ml Sephadex G-25 columns and then hybridized to GeneScreen Plus membranes according to the manufacturer's recommendations (DuPont, Bad Homburg, Germany). Blots were washed at 62 °C in 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm sodium citrate, and 35 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 7, followed by autoradiography. The genotypes of yeast strains are listed in Table I.

Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other manipulations were performed according to standard procedures (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Growth of yeast cells under non-starvation and starvation conditions and assays of β-galactosidase activity expressed fromlacZ fusion constructs were conducted as described previously (6Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and are expressed in nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside cleaved per min/mg of protein. Assays from three independent transformants were averaged. Results of individual assays varied 30% or less within each triplicate set. To test resistance to amino acid analogs, freshly grown yeast cells were streaked radially on solid SD medium to which supplements were added to satisfy auxotrophic requirements. Solid 3-AT (30 mg), ethionine (5 mg), or canavanine (2 mg) was placed in the center of the plate. After 4 days at 30 °C, the sensitivity of yeast cells to these compounds was determined by measuring the radius of the growth inhibitory zone (21Wolfner M. Yep D. Messenguy F. Fink G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The rps31-10 allele was isolated as a suppressor of the Tsm− lethal phenotype of thegcd1-505 allele in strain H472. The Tsm−phenotype of H472 is due to a mutation in GCD1, since transformation of the strain with Sc4015 plasmid DNA, a derivative of the URA3 vector YCp50 carrying the cloned GCD1gene, restored growth at high temperatures (13Hill D.E. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transformation with control constructs pB336 and pB337, containing frameshift mutations in the GCD1 coding region, did not complement the Tsm− phenotype of H472. For revertant selection, cells of strain H472 were grown to single colonies on solid YPD medium at 25 °C. Over 1000 single colonies were then transferred individually to solid YPEG medium. To allow formation of revertant colonies the cells were incubated for 2 weeks at 37 °C. A single revertant colony from each original colony was then transferred to solid YPD medium and grown for 2 days at 37 °C. Two YPD replicas were prepared from each original plate and incubated at 20 and at 37 °C, respectively. After 3 days, growth of colonies at low and high temperature was compared. M98, a high temperature-resistant revertant had a Csm−phenotype, grew slowly at 30 °C, and exhibited sensitivity to 3-AT. All three phenotypes were recessive when diploids were formed withGCD1 strains of the opposite mating type and complemented in diploids formed by crossing MT27B with strains F2, F21, F27, and MT32A, containing the mutant alleles gcn2-101, gcn4-102, gcn1-2, and gcn3::LEU2, respectively, suggesting that the suppressor was not an allele of theseGCN genes. Meiotic segregants that exhibit the Slg−, Csm−, and 3-AT-sensitive phenotypes of the rps31-10 mutation were obtained from a diploid formed between a sup mutant and a GCD1 strain. The three phenotypes of the revertant, slow growth, cold sensitivity, and suppression of gcd1 temperature sensitivity, co-segregated in genetic crosses and are therefore due to a single extragenic mutation, a conclusion that was confirmed subsequently by transformation with the wild-type RPS31 gene. As the Tsm− phenotype of gcd1-505 cannot be observed in the presence of the rps31-10 mutation, the allelic status of GCD1 in cold-sensitive meiotic segregants was tested by formation of diploids with gcd1-505Tsm− mutant strains H472 or MT27D. Non-complementation of the Tsm− phenotype in the resulting diploids indicates the presence of gcd1-505 in the rps31-10 strain. As expected, these double mutants exhibited the cold-sensitive and 3-AT-sensitive phenotypes of rps31-10 single mutants and displayed the Slg− and Tsm− phenotypes typical of gcd1-505 strains after transformation with plasmids carrying the wild-type RPS31 gene. The presence of the gcd2-1 allele in rps31-10 gcd2-1 double mutant meiotic segregants was established in two ways as follows: (i) by non-complementation of the Slg−phenotype of gcd2-1 in diploids derived from crosses of potential double mutants with gcd2-1 strains M18A or M18B, and (ii) by reappearance of the gcd2-1 phenotypes in meiotic segregants of diploids derived from crosses to GCD strains. Meiotic segregants were considered to contain gcd2-1 if they exhibited an Slg− phenotype, were resistant to amino acid starvation, and did not complement the Slg− phenotype of either gcd2-1 strain M18A or M18B strains. M7A, M7C, M8A, M8C, and M9B were meiotic segregants of a diploid obtained by crossing H1489 to M35C that have been transformed with the RPS31containing plasmid pB328; strains M7A, M7C, M8A, M8C, and M9B were mitotic segregants of the former strains that have spontaneously lost plasmid pB328 during growth on YPD medium. M9D is derived from two subsequent crosses of the Gcn2 constitutive strain H1613 to therps31-10 strains M35C and then to MT27B. M9C contains theRPS31 gene on the plasmid pB272 and is otherwise isogenic to M9D. rps31-10 gcd1::LEU2 double mutants were constructed by transformation of MC1062 with the low copy number, autonomously replicating plasmid Sc4015 that carried theGCD1 and URA3 genes. Ura+transformants that had become Trp− in the absence of selection pressure (due to the loss of the TRP1, GCD1plasmid) were mated to M35C and the resulting diploids sporulated. Sixrps31-10 gcd1::LEU2 meiotic segregants were identified by the cold-sensitive growth and Leu+phenotypes, and all were Ura+. None of these strains lost the Ura+ phenotype after many generations of growth on non-selective medium containing uracil, indicating that rps31-10 gcd1::LEU2 strains require the presence of theGCD1 URA3 plasmid for viability, indicating that therps31-10 allele did not rescue the lethality of thegcd1::LEU2 disruption. To confirm that the Sc4015 plasmid was still maintained extra-chromosomally and to verify that these strains carried the chromosomal gcd1 allele, they were mated to a gcd1-505 strain of the opposite mating type (MT27D or H472). In all six of the resultinggcd1-505/gcd1::LEU2 diploids, the Ura+phenotype was unstable during growth on non-selective media: of a total of 215 colonies grown on YPD medium, 183 were Ura+ and 32 were Ura−. All Ura− segregants were deficient in growth at 37 °C, whereas the Ura+ colonies grew at 37 °C, as expected if plasmid Sc4015 complemented the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the gcd1-505 allele. As a control, the rps31-10 GCD1 ura3 strain MT27B was transformed to uracil prototrophy with Sc4015 and grown on non-selective YPD medium. Ura− segregants were readily obtained, indicating that the rps31-10 mutation did not prevent Sc4015 plasmid loss during mitotic growth. For the construction of gcd1-505 rps17a::LEU2double mutants, the strain H1654 was mated to MT49B. The resulting diploid was sporulated, and 11 tetrads were analyzed by replica plating. Mating type, inositol prototrophy (indicative of rps17a::LEU2), small colony phenotype, and failure to grow at 37 °C on YPEG medium (indicative of thegcd1-505 allele), and leucine auxotrophy segregated 2+:2−, and for the latter two phenotypes, 7 tetratypes, 1 parental ditype, and 3 non-parental ditypes were observed, indicating that rps17a::LEU2 does not suppress the Tsm− phenotype of gcd1-505. Clonal segregants of two complete tetratype tetrads were streaked for single colonies on YPD medium and incubated at 37, at 35 (which is just below the restrictive temperature for gcd1-505), and at 20 °C.gcd1-505 RPS17a and gcd1-505 rps17a::LEU2 strains gave indistinguishable results as follows: both cell types did not form colonies at 37 °C but did form small colonies at 35 °C relative to the GCD1 RPS17a and GCD1 rps17a::LEU2 spores. At room temperature the difference in colony size between gcd1-505 and GCD1 cells was greatly diminished, as expected for temperature-sensitive mutants. That the temperature-sensitive phenotype observed was due to the mutant gcd1 allele was confirmed by non-complementation of the temperature sensitivity in diploids formed by crossing these strains to gcd1-505 mutant strains MT27D or H472. To test if rps31-10 suppresses the temperature sensitivity of sui2-1, strain A235 was crossed to an MT27B transformed with the RPS31 gene on the plasmid pB272.rps31-10 sui2-1 double mutant strains have been identified by first testing plasmid-containing segregants for temperature-sensitive growth at 38 °C, the sui2-1phenotype, then testing cells that had become Ura−, due to plasmid loss during growth on non-selective YPD medium at 30 °C, for the cold-sensitive rps31-10 phenotype. Cells of the revertant strain M98 were transformed to uracil prototrophy with a plasmid library containing Sau3AI partially cleaved wild-type yeast chromosomal DNA fragments inserted at theBamHI site of YCp50 (22Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C for 1 week, transformants were replica-plated to YPD medium and incubated at room temperature. Seven cold-resistant transformants were obtained. These were purified by restreaking for single colonies and tested for growth at room temperature and at 37 °C. All seven colonies were found to be heat-sensitive as well as low temperature-resistant. Total DNA isolated from the transformants was used to transform E. coli to ampicillin resistance. Two different plasmids, pB272 and pB273, with overlapping restriction patterns were isolated from the bacterial transformants. The pB272 plasmid with the smaller insert was used for further analysis. To prove that the genomic insert contained the wild-type suppressor gene, a diploid strain derived from the cross MT106B × MT160D was transformed to uracil prototrophy with the 2-kilobase pair BstEII restriction fragment of pB303 carrying sequences from the genomic insert in pB272 and theURA3 gene (see below for construction of pB303; see Ref.23Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). To confirm integration by homologous recombination, genomic DNA was isolated from 16 Ura+ transformants and analyzed by cleavage with either BstEII, PstI, orHindIII followed by DNA blot hybridization with a radioactively labeled 932-base pair BstEII fragment of pB272 used as a probe. Four transformants had the pattern of labeled bands expected for integration of the BstEII restriction fragment of pB303 at the suppressor locus by homologous recombination. There was no obvious phenotype other than uracil prototrophy associated with the integration of plasmid pB303, both in the diploid heterozygous transformants and in haploid meiotic segregants obtained by sporulating one such diploid, in agreement with the subsequent finding that the disrupted sequences are outside the translational reading frame that complemented the growth defects of the suppressor mutation. A haploid integrant M24C was then mated to the suppressor-containing strain T27B, and the resulting diploid was sporulated. In 10 out of 10 tetrads analyzed, each had two spores that were Ura+ and had no growth defect and two spores that were Ura− and cold-sensitive, showing that the integration site is closely linked to the suppressor locus. Therefore, the cloned DNA fragment is derived from the chromosomal region of the suppressor locus and most likely carries the wild-type suppressor allele. For complementation analysis, pB272 (Fig. 3, construct 1) was cleaved withHindIII and then religated to delete the fragment between the HindIII site in YCp50 and the HindIII site within the yeast genomic insert (pB276, Fig. 3, construct 2). pB272 was cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI, and the larger fragment was circularized in the presence of the oligonucleotides 5′ GATCGTCGACCG 3′ and 5′ AATTCGGTCGAC 3′ (pB277, Fig. 3, construct 3). A BstEII fragment was deleted from the insert in pB272 by cleavage with BstEII and recircularization (pB385, Fig. 3, construct 4). Partial cleavage of pB272 with BglII and religation deleted theBglII fragment from the yeast DNA insert (pB281, Fig. 3,construct 5). The region between the XhoI site in the genomic insert and the SalI site of pB272 was deleted by cleavage with SalI and partial cleavage with XhoI followed by a ligation step (pB298, Fig. 3, construct 6).BamHI-HindIII restricted pB273 DNA was separated by gel electrophoresis, extracted, and then ligated withBamHI-HindIII-digested YCp50, yielding pB393 (Fig. 3, construct 7). pB301 was constructed by deleting theXhoI fragment carrying the URA3 gene from pB272. To construct pB303, pB301 was linearized with BamHI, and a 1.1-kilobase pair BglII fragment from pVT-U carrying theURA3 gene was inserted (Fig. 3, construct 8). To obtain a plasmid suitable for preparation of serial deletions, one of the two XhoI sites of pB272 was eliminated by formation of an XhoI/SalI hybrid site. To this end pB272 was cleaved with XhoI and SalI and the two large fragments ligated, resulting in pB282. pB282 was linearized withXhoI, and serial deletions were created by treatment with exonuclease Bal-31. The fragments were then ligated in the presence of BglII linkers 5′ GGAAGATCTTCC 3′ (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). For sequence analysis, the BglII fragment carrying the URA3 gene was deleted from all the Bal-31 deletion constructs. A T7 polymerase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and the primer 5′ GCACTTGCCTGCAGGCC 3′ was used for sequencing double-stranded DNA of the Bal-31 deletion plasmids, starting from the PstI site in the YCp50 ARS1sequence. The primer 5′ CTACGCGATCATGGCG 3′ is complementary to YCp50 sequences and was used for sequencing the opposite end of the suppressor-containing DNA insert at the YCp50 plasmid/insert junction (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Comparison of the resulting DNA sequence with sequences in GenBankTM was done with the FastA program (25Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When the culture reached an A 600 of 1, cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C, washed once with 10 ml of ice-cold breaking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 50 mg/ml cycloheximide, 200 mg of heparin/ml), and resuspended in 1 ml of breaking buffer. Glass beads were added to ¼ of the total volume, and the cells were broken in a Braun Cell Homogenizer, shaking 3 times for 20 s each with 1-min intervals resting on ice. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. 3 A 260 units of cell extract were loaded on a 7–30% sucrose gradient containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mg/ml cycloheximide, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.

The insulinotropic effect of PACAP38 in insulin-producing HIT-T15 cells is accompanied by increases in cellular cAMP and cytoplasmic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt). As also intracellular Na+ is important for insulin secretion after glucose and other cAMP forming peptides, we examined the Na+ dependence of the insulinotropic effect of PACAP38 in HIT-T15 cells. We found that PACAP38 (100 nm)-induced insulin secretion was diminished by approximately 50% by removal of extracellular Na+(replaced by equimolar N-methyl-d-glucamine). In contrast, removal of Na+ did not diminish the formation of cellular cAMP (measured by radioimmunoassay) or the increase in [Ca2+]cyt (measured in FURA-2AM-loaded cell suspensions) induced by PACAP38. Furthermore, PACAP-38 increased the cytoplasmic Na+ ([Na+]cyt) in single HIT-T15 cells as measured by the fluorophore sodium-binding benzofran isophthalate. This increase was reduced by removal of extracellular Na+ and by inhibition of protein kinase A by H-89. We conclude that the insulinotropic action of PACAP38 is Na+-dependent. We propose that PACAP38 opens plasma membrane Na+ channels by an action partially mediated by cAMP and protein kinase A, and the subsequent raise in [Na+]cyt elicits insulin secretion by an as yet unsolved mechanism.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)1 was originally isolated from ovine hypothalamus where it was found to stimulate adenylate cyclase with a 1000 times greater potency than vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (1Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). PACAP shows a high structural homology with VIP and was therefore placed in the glucagon/VIP family of peptides (1Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). The peptide exists in two forms. The most abundant form in all tissues is PACAP38, which consists of 38 amino acid residues, and the other form is PACAP27, corresponding to the 27 N-terminal amino acid residues of PACAP38 (2Miyata A. Jiang L. Dahl R.R. Kitada C. Kubo K. Fujino M. Minamino N. Arimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). PACAP has been demonstrated to be a ubiquitously distributed neuropeptide throughout the body (3Arimura A. Shioda S. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the pancreas, PACAP is localized to nerves innervating the exocrine parenchyma, blood vessels, islets of Langerhans as well as to intrapancreatic ganglia (4Fridolf T. Sundler F. Ahrén B. Cell Tissue Res. 1992; 269: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Filipsson K. Sundler F. Hannibal J. Ahrén B. Regul. Pept. 1998; 74: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which suggests that the neuropeptide is involved in the neural regulation of pancreatic function. We have shown recently that two types of the presently three known PACAP receptor subtypes are expressed in insulin-producing tissues, the PACAP type 1 and the VIP2/PACAP receptors, which further supports a role for PACAP in regulating islet function (5Filipsson K. Sundler F. Hannibal J. Ahrén B. Regul. Pept. 1998; 74: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is well established that PACAP potently stimulates insulin secretion, as has been demonstratedin vitro in insulin-producing clonal cells (6Inagaki N. Yoshida H. Mizuta M. Mizuno M. Fujii Y.

Life Sci. 1992; 50: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,10Bertrand G. Puech R. Maissonnasse Y. Bockaert J. Loubatières-Mariani M.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as well as in vivo in mice (11Filipsson K. Pacini G. Scheurink A.J.W. Ahrén B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E834-E842PubMed Google Scholar) and humans (12Filipsson K. Tornoe K. Holst J.J. Ahrén B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3093-3098PubMed Google Scholar). The potent insulinotropic action of PACAP has been thought to be mediated by raised formation of cellular cAMP, since PACAP stimulates cAMP formation in insulin-producing tissues (13Straub S.G. Sharp G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1660-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14af Klinteberg K. Karlsson S. Ahrén B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and since cAMP through activation of protein kinase A (PKA) is known to stimulate the exocytosis of insulin containing granules (15Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Nature. 1993; 363: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, we showed previously that PACAP38 (100 nm) induces insulin secretion to a greater extent than the adenylate cyclase-activating agent forskolin (0.25 μm), even though at these doses PACAP38 and forskolin induce formation of cAMP to the same extent (14af Klinteberg K. Karlsson S. Ahrén B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that formation of cAMP cannot fully explain the insulinotropic effect of PACAP, which led us to speculate that also one or several other signaling mechanisms contribute to its insulinotropic action. Since PACAP38 also increases cytoplasmic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt) in insulin-producing HIT-T15 cells (14af Klinteberg K. Karlsson S. Ahrén B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such an action might contribute to the action of PACAP on insulin secretion, since Ca2+ accentuates the exocytosis of granules in insulin producing cells (16Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, in addition whether other signaling mediators for PACAP exist in insulin-producing cells remains to be established. Earlier studies in human pituitary adenoma cells have shown that PACAP induces growth hormone secretion with a mechanism that is inhibited by tetrodotoxin, a voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker, and that PACAP increases tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel currents in such cells (17Koshimura K. Murakami Y. Mitsushima M. Hori T. Kato Y. Peptides (Elmsford). 1997; 18: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This would suggest that also increased uptake of Na+ is a mechanism for actions induced by PACAP. Extracellular Na+ has been shown previously to be required for glucose-induced insulin secretion in β-cells (18Hellman B. Sehlin J. Söderberg M. Täljedal I.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 252: 701-712Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Donatsch P. Lowe D.A. Richardson B.P. Taylor P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1977; 267: 357-376Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and, furthermore, the muscarinic agonist, acetylcholine, has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion in a Na+-dependent manner (20Henquin J.C. Garcia M.C. Bozem M. Hermans M.P. Nenquin M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which, like PACAP, activates adenylate cyclase (21Drucker D.J. Philippe J. Mojsov S. Chich W.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3434-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), stimulates insulin secretion in a Na+-dependent manner (22Fridolf T. Ahrén B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the possible contribution by Na+ on influences of PACAP in insulin secretory cells, by studying the Na+ dependence of the effect of PACAP38 on insulin secretion, on cAMP formation, and on [Ca2+]cyt in insulin-producing clonal hamster insulinoma HIT-T15 cells. Since pronounced Na+-dependent effects were found on insulin secretion, suggesting that Na+ indeed is of importance for the insulinotropic action of PACAP, we proceeded and used the fluorophore Na+-binding benzofran isophthalate (SBFI) to study whether PACAP38 also affects the cytoplasmic concentration of Na+ ([Na+]cyt) in these cells. PACAP38 was from Peninsula Europe Laboratories, Merseyside, United Kingdom (UK). RPMI 1640 medium and amphotericin were from Life Technologies AB, Täby, Sweden. Fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, and streptomycin were from Kebo Laboratory, Spånga, Sweden. H89 was from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Flasks, 24-well plates, and 4-well plates were from Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark. Guinea pig anti-porcine insulin, mono-125I-insulin, and rat insulin were from Linco Research, St. Charles, MO. Radioimmunoassay kit for cAMP with rabbit anti-succinyl AMP serum, cyclic 2-succinyl-3-125I-methyl ester, and cyclic AMP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Amersham, UK. All other chemicals, including FURA-2AM, SBFI-AM, and 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) were from Sigma. HIT-T15 cells, i.e. the clonal hamster β-cell line, were cultured at +37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. Passages were performed every 7 days, and the medium was changed every 3–4 days. Cells of the passages 72–82 were used. Cells were seeded on 24-well plates (0.5 million cells/well) and cultured for 48 h (about 80% confluence). They were then washed twice in a Hepes medium (125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, 0.1% human serum albumin, pH 7.36) and incubated at 37 °C in the Hepes medium in a volume of 200 μl at 10 mm glucose with or without PACAP38. In the Na+-free medium, NaCl was replaced with an equimolar concentration of N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG). After the end of incubation, 150 μl of the medium were collected and centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min. Aliquots of 50 μl in duplicate were then stored at −20 °C until analysis of insulin by radioimmunoassay, using guinea pig anti-porcine insulin, mono-125I-insulin, and, as standard, rat insulin. Free and bound radioactivity were separated by the double antibody technique. HIT-T15 cells were seeded on four-well plates (0.5 million cells/well) and cultured for 48 h as above. The cells were then washed twice in the Hepes medium and incubated at +37 °C in a volume of 200 μl in presence of 10 mm glucose and 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine with or without addition of PACAP38 (100 nm) or forskolin (0.25 μm). In the Na+-free medium, NaCl was replaced by NMDG. The incubation was stopped after 2 min with addition of ice-cold ethanol (final concentration: 65%), and the cells were scraped off with a rubber policeman. After being washed twice in 65% ice-cold ethanol, the extracts were centrifuged at 2000 ×g at +4 °C for 15 min, transferred to fresh test-tubes, evaporated at +60 °C under a stream of nitrogen, and then stored at −20 °C until analysis for protein content by the Lowry method (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for cAMP by radioimmunoassay, using a rabbit anti-succinyl-AMP serum, cyclic 2-succinyl-3-125I-methyl ester as tracer, and cAMP as standard. Free and bound radioactivity were separated by the double antibody technique. [Ca2+]cyt was determined in FURA-2AM-loaded HIT-T15 cells as described previously (14af Klinteberg K. Karlsson S. Ahrén B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown for 4–7 days in RPMI medium supplemented as above. After trypsination, cells recovered for 2 h in 10 ml of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS at +37 °C in 5% CO2 and were thereafter loaded with FURA-2AM (1 μm) for 45 min. The cells were then washed either in a Hepes medium as described above or in a Hepes medium in which NaCl was replaced by NMDG. After equilibration for 20 min, 2 ml of the cell suspension (0.5 million cells/ml) were transferred to a cuvette for measurement of [Ca2+]cyt in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 spectrophotofluorometer at +37 °C. PACAP38 was added at defined time points and remained in the cuvette until the end of the experiment. Excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm, and the emission wavelength was 510 nm. Fluorescence maximum was obtained by adding 0.03% Triton X-100 and fluorescence minimum by adding EGTA in excess at the end of experiments performed in the absence of albumin. [Ca2+]cyt was calculated according to Grynkiewicz et al. (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Na+]cyt was determined in SBFI-AM-loaded cells using the protocol of Davies et al. (25Davies J. Tomlinson S. Elliott A.C. Best L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on round (φ 25 mm) sterile glass coverslips and cultured for 48–72 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as above. Cells attached to the coverslips were washed and loaded for 2 h with SBFI (7 μm) in the presence of 0.02% Pluronic F-127R (Sigma) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS at +37 °C in 5% CO2. After loading, the cells were washed again in the Hepes medium or in a Hepes medium in which NaCl was replaced with NMDG. The coverslips were then mounted in a specially designed temperature-controlled (+37 °C) open superifusion chamber (volume: 110 μl). The coverslip with the attached cells constituted the bottom of the chamber, which was placed over a 100× Fluor objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon, DIAPHOT-TMD) with a 75-watt xenon lamp. Cannulas connected to peristaltic pumps, regulating both inflow and outflow, were fixed to the temperature-controlled chamber, and the cells were superifused at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min in Hepes buffer (with NaCl or NMDG) supplemented with 3.3 mm glucose and 0.05% bovine serum albumin. The chamber, the stage of the inverted microscope, the peristaltic pump regulating the inflow to the chamber, as well as the experimental solutions were contained in a climate box maintained at +37 °C. The time for equilibration in the superifusion chamber when changing the experimental solutions of the superifusate (80 s) were taken into account when indicating the switch of experimental solutions in the graphs presented. The fluorescence of SBFI was recorded with dual wavelength excitation spectrophotofluorometry using a Nikon P1 photometer (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) modified with a 1000-Ω resistor to increase the sensitivity of the recordings. The excitation wavelengths were 350 and 380 nm, and the emission wavelength was 510 nm, respectively. The filter changer and the data collection were governed by software designed by Bergström Instrument AB (Solna, Sweden). The values are reported as the ratio between fluorescence at 350versus 380 nm, which is proportional to [Na+]cyt (26Gilon P. Henquin J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic pH (pHcyt) was measured in BCECF-AM-loaded HIT-T15 cell suspensions using a protocol of Trebilcock et al. (27Trebilcock R. Lynch A. Tomlinson S. Best L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 71: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which was modified according to our technique of measuring [Ca2+]cyt as described above. After trypsination and recovery, the cells were loaded with 4 μm BCECF-AM for 45 min at +37 °C in 5% CO2. Experiments were carried out in a Hepes buffer as described above, containing 125 mm NaCl, or in a Hepes medium in which NaCl was replaced by 125 mm NMDG. The excitation wavelength was 500 nm and emission wavelength was 530 nm. Calibration was achieved by using an additional cell suspension handled the same as the experimental cell suspension (27Trebilcock R. Lynch A. Tomlinson S. Best L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 71: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cells in both preparations were lysed with 0.03% Triton X-100, and thereafter small aliquots of HCl were added to the suspensions. Fluorescence was measured in the experimental suspension, and pH in the calibration suspension, and the two curves were then plotted against each other. The results are reported as means ± S.E. HIT-T15 cells exhibit a large variation between insulin secretion depending on passage numbers, even within the narrow range of 70–81 (28Zhang H.J. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P.

Therefore, besides reporting data as absolute values, the results are also normalized for each individual experiment and expressed as percent of controls run in the same experiment and assay. Statistical evaluation of differences between groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or by two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired comparisons, except regarding [Ca2+]cyt and [Na+]cyt when statistical evaluation was performed by the Mann-Whitney U test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. In the presence of extracellular Na+, PACAP38 increased medium insulin from 1230 ± 131 pmol/liter to 6410 ± 687 pmol/liter (p < 0.001), whereas in the absence of extracellular Na+, medium insulin was increased from 1840 ± 107 pmol/liter to only 4640 ± 431 pmol/liter (p < 0.001) by the peptide, representing a reduction of the insulinotropic effect of PACAP38 by 45 ± 4.0% after removal of extracellular Na+ (Fig. 1). Hence, the results show that the Na+ dependence for the action of PACAP is not restricted to pituitary cells (17Koshimura K. Murakami Y. Mitsushima M. Hori T. Kato Y. Peptides (Elmsford). 1997; 18: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and, furthermore, that PACAP resembles glucose, acetylcholine, and the cAMP-forming peptide, GLP-1, exhibiting partial Na+ dependence for insulinotropic action (18Hellman B. Sehlin J. Söderberg M. Täljedal I.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 252: 701-712Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Donatsch P. Lowe D.A. Richardson B.P. Taylor P. J. Physiol.

Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Fridolf T. Ahrén B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Na+ dependence of the action of PACAP38 might be executed by Na+ being important for the generation of cAMP or for the increase in [Ca2+]cyt, since PACAP38 increases cAMP formation and [Ca2+]cyt in HIT-T15 cells (14af Klinteberg K. Karlsson S. Ahrén B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potential site of the Na+dependence was therefore further examined by determining cAMP and [Ca2+]cyt in HIT-T15 cells after PACAP38 activation. To investigate whether removal of extracellular Na+ affects the PACAP38-induced formation of cellular cAMP, the cells were incubated at 10 mm glucose with the addition of 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 2 min in the presence or absence of extracellular Na+. Fig. 2 shows that PACAP increased cellular cAMP from 10.9 ± 0.9 fmol/μg protein to 41.4 ± 2.6 fmol/μg protein in the presence of Na+ (p< 0.001). This effect was not reduced by removing Na+ from the medium (13.3 ± 0.4 fmol/μg protein without PACAP38versus 40.2 ± 3.4 fmol/μg protein with PACAP38;p < 0.001). Similarly, the effect of forskolin (0.25 μm) on cellular cAMP formation was not affected by removal of extracellular Na+, since cellular cAMP content was 50.1 ± 5.7 fmol/μg protein in the presence of extracellular Na+ and 43.5 ± 1.7 fmol/μg protein in a Na+-free medium after stimulation by forskolin (not significant, Fig. 2). These results thus show that the activation of adenylate cyclase by PACAP38 or forskolin in HIT-T15 cells is a process not dependent on Na+. This is in contrast to previous studies in parotid glands showing that the binding of Gs-protein to the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase is Na+-dependent (29Watson E.L. Jacobson K.L. Singh J.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which suggests that the Na+ dependence of Gs-protein binding to adenylate cyclase is different in different cell systems or that the PACAP-activated Gs is different from other Gs-proteins in this respect. A third possibility is that a minimal amount of Na+ remains intracellularly despite incubating the cells in a medium devoid of Na+ during experiments, and this is sufficient to facilitate the binding of the Gs-protein to adenylate cyclase. In any case, our results show that the Na+ dependence of the insulinotropic effect of PACAP38 is located further downstream from adenylate cyclase of the intracellular pathway in HIT-T15 cells or executed by signaling mechanisms of PACAP not involving cAMP. It is known that PACAP38 increases [Ca2+]cyt in HIT-T15 cells (14af Klinteberg K. Karlsson S. Ahrén B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In isolated rat islets, uptake of extracellular Ca2+ induced by GLP-1 is abolished by removal of extracellular Na+ (22Fridolf T. Ahrén B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This would infer that a site of the Na+ dependence for GLP-1, and therefore perhaps also for PACAP38, resides in the mechanism of increased [Ca2+]cyt. We therefore examined the Na+ dependence of the increase in [Ca2+]cyt induced by PACAP38 in FURA-2-AM-loaded cell suspensions. We found, as seen in Fig. 3, that PACAP38 increased the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+ both in the presence and in the absence of extracellular Na+. Furthermore, in the absence of extracellular Na+, the increase in [Ca2+]cyt in response to PACAP38 was greater than in the control cells incubated in the presence of extracellular Na+. Thus, at 300 s after addition of PACAP38, [Ca2+]cyt had increased by 200 ± 8 nmol/liter in the absence of extracellular Na+ versus 52.0 ± 7 nmol/liter in the presence of extracellular Na+ (p < 0.001; Fig. 3,A and B). Therefore, in contrast to previous results that the Ca2+ uptake in isolated rat islets in response to GLP-1 was reduced by removal of extracellular Na+ (22Fridolf T. Ahrén B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), PACAP38 induced an exaggerated increase in [Ca2+]cyt after omission of Na+from the medium. Hence, the Na+ dependence of the insulinotropic action of PACAP38 does not reside in impaired increase in [Ca2+]cyt. The finding that the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+ increased after activation by PACAP38 also in the absence of extracellular Na+ suggests that the opening of Ca2+ channels is not dependent on depolarization of the cell by the influx of Na+, but is instead dependent on other mechanisms. One such mechanism could involve opening of PKA-dependent Ca2+ channels (15Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Nature. 1993; 363: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that in HIT-T15 cells, the PACAP38-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt is abolished when adenylate cyclase is activated by forskolin prior to introduction of PACAP38, suggesting that cAMP in fact mediates the opening of membranous Ca2+channels (14af Klinteberg K. Karlsson S. Ahrén B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility involves opening of Ca2+channels directly coupled to a G-protein activated by PACAP38. Such a Ca2+ channel, which is directly opened after activation of a G-protein, has been described previously to be coupled to at least one of the PACAP receptors expressed in the pancreatic endocrine tissue (30Chatterjee T.K. Sharma R.V. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to examine this possibility. The potentiated PACAP38-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt in the absence of extracellular Na+ is interpreted to reflect that the countertransport through Na+-Ca2+ exchange ion channels is prevented by removal of extracellular Na+. Such countertransport is of importance for the cellular Ca2+homeostasis (31Yoshihashi K. Shibuya I. Kanno T. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1996; 46: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and when prevented by removal of extracellular Na+, the increase in [Ca2+]cyt by PACAP38 is accentuated. The results above imply that Na+ is involved in the insulinotropic effect of PACAP38 in HIT-T15 cells, although the exact site of this involvement is still an open question. Indirect actions through cAMP or Ca2+ seem less likely, since neither the formation of cAMP nor the increase in [Ca2+]cyt after PACAP38 was reduced by removal of Na+, although the insulin secretory response to PACAP38 was impaired. This pattern of effects could be executed by activation of a channel increasing the uptake of Na+, with a subsequent increase in cytoplasmic concentration of Na+yielding a direct secretory action of intracellular Na+. To examine this possibility, we measured [Na+]cyt by using the fluorophore SBFI in HIT-T15 cells. Measurement of [Na+]cyt in insulin-producing cells by using SBFI has been performed previously by several groups showing that glucose, glyceraldehyde, and acetylcholine increase the [Na+]cyt, which might contribute to the insulinotropic action of these secretagogues (25Davies J. Tomlinson S. Elliott A.C. Best L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Gilon P. Henquin J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Grapengiesser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Miura Y. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In our hands, measurement of [Na+]cyt in suspensions of HIT-T15 cells by using SBFI did not yield reliable results, despite extensive trials in our laboratory (data not shown). We therefore proceeded to measure [Na+]cyt in single cells, which proved successful. As is seen in Fig. 4 A, PACAP38 increased [Na+]cyt in a medium containing both extracellular Na+ and Ca2+. At 400 s after introduction of PACAP38, the ratio of [Na+]cyt fluorescence had increased from 0.68 ± 0.02 in controls to 0.80 ± 0.03 (p = 0.018) after stimulation by PACAP38. Fig. 4 B shows a typical trace of such an experiment. In contrast, when extracellular Na+ was replaced with NMDG (125 mm), the effect of PACAP38 was abolished (Fig. 4 C). This implies that PACAP38 activates a Na+ channel mediating the uptake of extracellular Na+, thereby increasing the intracellular Na+ concentration. The PACAP38-induced increase in [Na+]cyt was abolished also when the cells were treated with 20 μm H89 (Fig. 4 C), which is a specific PKA inhibitor (34Hidaka H. Kobayashi R. Essays Biochem. 1994; 28: 73-97PubMed Google Scholar). These results imply that PACAP38 causes an uptake of Na+ into the cells and that this uptake is mediated by PKA and therefore probably executed through a PKA-sensitive Na+ channel. These findings support the important notion by Leech et al. (35Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1530-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that PACAP stimulates an inward current in HIT-T15 cells, which is mainly caused by an influx of Na+ into the cells and which is mediated by cAMP. This is also consistent with a previous study showing that cAMP activates a cation channel in the rat insulinoma cell line CRI-G1 (36Reale V. Hales C.N. Ashford M.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A possible confounding factor in studying effects of removal of Na+ from the extracellular medium on insulin secretion is the potential influence through changes in pHcyt. Omission of Na+ from the medium abolishes the Na+-H+ exchange, thus preventing H+ to be transported out from the cytoplasm, which has been shown previously to be of importance for the regulation of pHcyt in the β-cell (37Biden T.J. Janjic D. Wollheim C.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C207-C213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, removal of extracellular Na+ might reduce the pHcyt, which might then affect exocytosis. The inhibitory effect of removal of extracellular Na+ on PACAP38-induced insulin secretion might thus partially be explained by alteration in pHcyt. To examine whether removal of Na+ actually affects pHcyt in HIT-T15 cells, we measured pHcyt in cell suspensions by using the fluorophore BCECF-AM. We found that removal of extracellular Na+ expectedly decreased pHcyt (Fig. 5). Thus, at time 0, pHcyt was 7.41 ± 0.04 in the presence of extracellular Na+ and 7.02 ± 0.11 (p= 0.035) when Na+ in the medium was replaced with NMDG (125 mm). pHcyt was stable throughout the study period, and therefore this difference in pHcyt, in the presence versus in the absence of extracellular Na+, persisted throughout the study period (Fig. 5). Introduction of PACAP38 did not alter pHcyt, neither in the presence nor in the absence of extracellular Na+. To test whether this reduction in pHcyt contributes to the reduced insulin secretion seen after PACAP38 in a Na+-free medium, HIT-T15 cells were incubated with or without PACAP38 in media of different extracellular pH. The cellular buffering of changes in extracellular pH (38Lindström P. Sehlin J. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was compensated by decreasing the extracellular pH to 6.8 to examine the influence of pHcyt of 7.0. We found that lowering of extracellular pH from 7.36 to 6.8 did not affect insulin secretion stimulated by 10 mm glucose alone or by 10 mm glucose together with 100 nm PACAP38 (Fig. 6). Thus, the inhibitory effect of removal of Na+ on PACAP38-induced insulin secretion cannot be explained by the accompanying change in pHcyt.Figure 6Insulin secretion from HIT-T15 cells incubated for 60 min in medium with extracellular pH of 7.36 (open columns) and 6.8 (gray columns), with or without addition of PACAP38 (100 nm).

PACAP38 therefore resembles GLP-1 in this respect (22Fridolf T. Ahrén B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the Na+ dependence of actions of PACAP is not restricted to pituitary cells (17Koshimura K. Murakami Y. Mitsushima M. Hori T. Kato Y. Peptides (Elmsford). 1997; 18: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The failure of removal of extracellular Na+ to completely abolish the insulinotropic action of PACAP38 infers that the signaling pathway mediating the insulinotropic effect of PACAP38 may be partly activated in the absence of extracellular Na+ or, alternatively, that several intracellular pathways might be involved, whereof at least one is strictly Na+-sensitive. Examining these possibilities, we found that the Na+ dependence does not involve the formation of cAMP or the increase in [Ca2+]cyt and that PACAP38 increases [Na+]cyt by a mechanism abolished by inhibition of PKA. This shows that neither activation of adenylate cyclase nor a rise in [Ca2+]cyt can explain the Na+ dependence of PACAP and suggests that cAMP and raised [Ca2+]cyt can not solely explain PACAP38-induced insulin secretion. Instead, our results are integratively interpreted to indicate that PACAP38 Na+-independently stimulates formation of cAMP, which activates PKA, which, in turn, opens both Ca2+ and Na+ channels. The subsequent influx of Na+raises the cytoplasmic level of Na+, which then contributes to the PACAP-induced insulin secretion. This contribution could be mediated by depolarization induced by increased intracellular Na+, which, in turn, could augment Ca2+ uptake by opening of voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels. A tentative remaining possibility is that Na+ per se is of importance for the exocytotic mechanism. However, although exocytosis of secretory granules in β-cells has been shown to be mediated by several proteins (39Sharp G.W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Na+ dependence of the action of these proteins remains to be studied. Finally, it should be emphasized that in several excitable tissues, such as neuronal cells, influx of Na+ through voltage-gated ion channels plays a major role in cell activation by inducing depolarization (40Kallen R.G. Cohen S.A. Barichi R.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 383-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our present results therefore strengthen the similarity between insulin producing cells and other excitable cells also in this respect."

Bloodstream forms of African trypanosomes possess a large repertoire of surface antigen (VSG)1 genes (1Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Liu A.Y.C. De Lange T. Bernards A. Borst P. Grosveld F.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5905-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Only one glycoprotein is expressed at a time, and it forms the cell-surface glycoprotein coat (2Vickerman K. J.

Due to rapid switching of the expression of VSG genes coding for antigenically different proteins, the parasites continuously change their antigenicity (antigenic variation) and are thus able to evade the immune response of the host (for recent reviews see Refs. 4Cross G.A.M. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar and 5Borst P. Rudenko G. Taylor M.C. Blundell P.A. van Leeuwen F. Bitter W. Cross M. McCulloch R. Arch. Med. Res. 1996; 27: 379-388PubMed Google Scholar). In the past, approximately 30 amino acid sequences of different VSGs from several trypanosome species had been determined. Although highly variable in their amino acid sequences, these proteins contain conserved structural elements, i.e. a two-domain structure with a 350-residue N-terminal domain and a 50–150-residue C-terminal domain (6Johnson J.G. Cross G.A.M. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All domains, except the C-terminal domain of Trypanosoma congolense, have positionally conserved cysteine residues. According to the distribution of the cysteine residues, three N-terminal domain types (A, B, and C) and four C-terminal domain types (types 1–4) were defined (7Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The majority of the sequencedTrypanosoma brucei VSGs have type A N-terminal domains; all of the T. congolense VSGs have N-terminal domains of the type B. The type A domain has four positionally conserved cysteine residues, and the type B domain has eight (7Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Rausch S. Shayan P. Salnikoff J. Reinwald E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been shown in three VSGs that the pattern of disulfide linkages in the A-type domain is conserved (9Allen G. Gurnett L.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Blum M.L. Down J.A. Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As revealed by x-ray crystallography, one of the disulfide bridges is responsible for interconnecting short peptide loops regarded to be important for the antigenicity of the molecules. The second disulfide bond interconnects two parallel α-helices forming the VSG stem region (10Freymann D. Down J. Carrington M. Roditi I. Turner M. Wiley D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 141-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Blum M.L. Down J.A. Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Until now, nothing is known about the bonding of the cysteine residues in B-type VSGs. A prediction of the bonding pattern on the basis of A-type disulfide bonding is not possible because the positions of the cysteine residues in the B-type peptide chain differ so greatly from those in the A-type domain. One objective of this work was to investigate whether or not the location of cystines within a B-type VSG is compatible with the A-type tertiary structure. We have recently sequenced several B-type VSGs (8Rausch S. Shayan P. Salnikoff J. Reinwald E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and selected one of them, BENat 1.3, to determine its disulfide bonding pattern. BENat 1.3 VSG is 407 amino acids long and contains eight cysteine residues in the conserved positions of the eight-cysteine motif typical for B-type VSGs (7Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I.

All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Water purified by a Milli-QTM Ultra-pure water system was used throughout. T. congolense clone BENat 1.3 was used for this study. BENat 1.3 is a cell clone derived from the third peak of parasitemia of a New Zealand rabbit chronically infected with BENat 1, the origin of which is described (12Reinwald E. Risse H.-J. Sälker R. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The parasites were grown in mice and rats and harvested according to standard procedures (13Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Trypanosomes were washed three times with NaCl/Pi/glucose (44 mm NaCl, 60 mmsodium phosphate, 55 mm glucose, pH 8.0) and resuspended in cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 7 × 107 cells/ml. After a preincubation period (30 min, 37 °C) l-[35S]cysteine was added to a final activity of 0.63 MBq/ml. Incorporation of radioactivity was controlled by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and liquid scintillation counting of filter-bound radioactivity. The labeling reaction was stopped by centrifuging (10 min, 4000 ×g) and washing with NaCl/Pi (145 mmNaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) when either the medium became metabolically acidified or the incorporation reached a plateau. This usually occurred after 4–6 h. Washed trypanosomes were subjected to dioxane lysis according to Ref. 14Reinwald E. Rautenberg P. Risse H.-J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. VSG was purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using concanavalin A-Sepharose. Lectin-bound glycoprotein was electrophoretically desorbed and isoelectrically focused as described elsewhere (14Reinwald E. Rautenberg P. Risse H.-J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography with Bio-Gel P30 (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) and subsequently lyophilized. For carboxymethylation of free thiol groups, 10 μg of unlabeled glycoprotein were dissolved (1 mg/ml) in helium-purged 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. 3 μl of 5 mm[14C]iodoacetic acid (1.4 × 105 Bq/nmol protein) were added, and the tube was sealed and incubated in the dark at 37 °C with shaking. The sample was tested for incorporation of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting after trichloroacetic acid precipitation and fluorography after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For tryptic digestion the protein was dissolved (1 mg/ml) in helium-purged 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 10% (v/v) ACN and 3–10 μg of trypsin/100 μg of protein. Incubation was carried out at 25 °C for 45 h, with the addition of fresh trypsin every 15 h. Chymotryptic digestion of tryptic peptides was carried out in helium-purged 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8, with 10 mm CaCl2 and 5% (v/v) ACN. 15 μg of peptide were dissolved in digestion buffer (final concentration 1 mg/ml) and were incubated with 1 μg of enzyme for 30 h at 25 °C, and fresh enzyme was added after 15 h. Digestion of tryptic peptides with staphylococcal serine protease was carried out in helium-purged 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. 15 μg of peptide were dissolved in digestion buffer (final concentration 1 mg/ml) and incubated with 5 μg of enzyme for 67 h at 25 °C. Tryptic peptides were isolated by rHPLC (Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany) employing a Vydac (Hesperia, CA) column 218TP54 (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, 3-nm pore width). Alternatively, a column (4.6 × 250 mm) filled with Shandon Hypersil (3-μm particle size; 12-nm pore width) was used. Microscale analyses of subdigested tryptic peptides were performed on a Vydac 201HS52 narrow bore column (2.1 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size; 9-nm pore width). Chromatography was carried out in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or 25 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, at 30 °C and peptides were desorbed from the reversed-phase matrices by an ACN gradient. Peptides, 20–50 pmol, were sequenced by automated N-terminal Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) pulsed liquid-phase sequencer, model 477A, under standard conditions. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of amino acids were identified by an on-line analyzer, model 120 A (Applied Biosystems) with a repetitive yield of 92–95%. Molecular masses of peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS on a Finnigan MAT model Vision 2000 mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). 1 μl of peptide solution (about 1 pmol) was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (10 μg/μl 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% (v/v) ACN) and allowed to air-dry. Ions were generated by short laser pulses (N2 laser, 337 nm), and positive ions were accelerated and detected in the reflector mode. Spectra were calibrated using angiotensin as an external standard. Non-reduced BENat 1.3 VSG was denatured in urea and radiocarboxymethylated with [14C]iodoacetic acid. Liquid scintillation counting after trichloroacetic acid precipitation and fluorography after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed no incorporation of radioactivity (data not shown). Thus all eight cysteine residues were found to be disulfide-bonded. The strategy employed to localize the disulfide bridges is based on N-terminal sequence analysis and MALDI-TOF-MS of cystine-containing peptides after proteolytic fragmentation of the glycoprotein. After tryptic digestion of l-[35S]cysteine-labeled VSG, the peptides were separated by rHPLC using the following five-step ACN (in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) gradient: 5% ACN for 5 min, 5–24% ACN from 5 to 15 min, 24% ACN for 5 min, 24–29% ACN from 20 to 80 min, and 29–40% ACN from 80- to 100 min. Five radioactive peaks were eluted at 16 min (24% ACN), 22.2 min (24.2% ACN), 27 min (24.6% ACN), 50.8 min (26.6% ACN), and 58.7 min (27.2% ACN). N-terminal sequences of cystine-containing peptides found in the five radioactive fractions are given in Table I.Table IResults of an analysis of N-terminal sequence of tryptic, cystine-containing peptides from BENat 1.3 VSG separated by rHPLCPeakAmino acids found in cycleTryptic peptideCysteine residues in fragment12345678910111IleLeu*ArgIle14–Arg17Cys16AspAla*IleGlyArgAsp234–Arg239Cys2362LysProGlyLeuPheGlyThrIleThrThrAla..Lys271–Lys306Cys286, Cys2983LysProGlyLeuPheGlyThrIleThrThrAla..Lys271–?Cys286, Cys2984GlyGlnThr*GlySerSerGlyLeuGlySer..Gly168–Lys179Cys171GlyAlaAsnThrGlyAspSerLeuValIleAsp..Gly180–?Cys193, Cys195, Cys2065GlyGlnThr*GlySerSerGlyLeuGlySer..Gly168–Lys179Cys171GlyAlaAsnThrGlyAspSerLeuValIleAsp..Gly180–Lys197Cys193, Cys195Ala*GlyGluAspValSerValAlaSerPro..Ala205–Lys226Cys206*, cysteines according to the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence (8Rausch S.

Peak 1 was found to contain equimolar amounts of the fragments Ile14–Arg17 and Asp234–Arg239. In one of the radioactive fractions obtained from an alternate purification of the tryptic digest in ammonium acetate (data not shown), these fragments were also found by sequence analysis to coelute, which proves that they are covalently bound through a disulfide bridge between cysteine residues 16 and 236. Peptides in peaks 2 and 3 were found to have the same N-terminal sequence, beginning with position 271, and were presumed to be resolved due to partially incomplete tryptic cleavage. According to the cDNA-derived sequence, they contain the cysteine residues at positions 286 and 298. Isolated peak 2 peptide was further cleaved with staphylococcal serine protease under conditions that allow cleavage after aspartic acid as well as glutamic acid (phosphate buffer, pH 7.8). Two fragments, 2.1 and 2.2, were resolved by rHPLC eluting at 31.9 and 32.9% ACN, respectively. By MALDI-TOF-MS two major mass peaks were detected in each of the two peaks: 3744.2 and 3503.8 in peak 2.1 and 3430.1 and 3189.2 in peak 2.2. These masses were incompatible with masses calculated for peptides expected from the cDNA-derived sequence. Therefore, the peptide in peak 2.1 was completely sequenced by Edman degradation. Two deviations from the cDNA-derived sequence were found as follows: lysine was identified instead of the predicted asparagine at position 290, and at position 293 asparagine was detected instead of the predicted serine. Taking into account these two deviations and the fact that the peptides were only partially cleaved C-terminal to Asp287 and Asp304, the mass data match the calculated peptide masses perfectly (Table II). Peak 2.1 contains the peptide Lys271–Lys290 linked to the peptide Ala291–Lys306 (M cal, 3744.0) or to the peptide Ala291–Asp304(M cal, 3502.6), and peak 2.2 contains the peptide Lys271–Asp287 linked to the peptide Ala291-Lys306 (M cal, 3430.7) or to the peptide Ala291–Asp304(M cal, 3189.3).Table IIStructures, calculated (Mcal), and experimentally determined (Mexp) masses of cystine-containing peptides after subdigestion of the tryptic peptide from peak 2 with staphylococcal serine protease Open table in a new tab N-terminal sequence analysis of peaks 4 and 5 (Table I) showed that they both contain the cysteine residues 171, 193, 195, and 206 but that the peptide in peak 4 was incompletely cleaved. A further deviation from the sequence derived from the cDNA clone was found in the third fragment of the peptide in peak 5, at position 212, where valine was identified instead of the predicted isoleucine. The peptide was repurified by rHPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The detected mass was 5084 Da, whereas the mass calculated for the disulfide-bonded triple peptide, based on the cDNA sequence and taking into account the substitution of valine for isoleucine, was 5099 Da. This discrepancy of 15 Da implies a further amino acid divergence. The peptide was digested with chymotrypsin, and the resulting fragments were separated by rHPLC. Two completely digested subpeptides, 5.1 (eluting at 26% ACN) and 5.2 (eluting at 28.4% ACN), could be identified by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analysis. As shown in Table III, subpeptide 5.1 contains amino acids 168–172 and 193–194, which proves that Cys171 is linked to Cys193. The mass detected for this subpeptide, 1040.2 Da, is compatible with the mass calculated from the cDNA-derived sequence. Subpeptide 5.2 contains amino acids 195–197 and 205–217, proving that Cys195 is linked to Cys206. The experimentally determined mass for this subpeptide is 1652 Da, which is 16 Da less than the calculated mass based on the cDNA sequence. Since all amino acids in this fragment except Glu216 and Trp217 were confirmed by Edman degradation (Tables I and III), it seems likely that the sequence deviates at position 216. (Substituting aspartic acid for glutamic acid in the mass calculation would result in a mass difference of 14 Da.)Table IIIResults of N-terminal sequence analysis and calculated (Mcal) and experimentally determined (Mexp) masses of cystine-containing peptides from peak 5 after chymotrypsin digestion and separation by rHPLCPeptideAmino acids found in cycleAmino acid and cysteine positions within peptideM expM cal12345Da5.1GlyGlnThr*Gly168–172; Cys1711040.21041.4*Leu193–194; Cys1935.2*AlaLys195–197; Cys1951652.01667.8Ala*GlyGluAsp205–209; Cys206*, cysteines according to the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence (8Rausch S.

Open table in a new tab *, cysteines according to the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence (8Rausch S. Shayan P. Salnikoff J. Reinwald E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, all four disulfide bonds of BENat 1.3 VSG from T. congolense are identified. A schematic representation of the disulfide-bonding pattern is shown in Fig. 1. The eight cysteine residues of BENat 1.3-VSG form four disulfide bonds, i.e. Cys16/Cys236, Cys171/Cys193, Cys195/Cys206, and Cys286/Cys298. All cysteine residues are positionally conserved (8Rausch S. Shayan P. Salnikoff J. Reinwald E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be assumed that the disulfide bonding pattern of BENat 1.3-VSG is the prototype of disulfide bonds in VSG B domains. This, however, remains to be proven experimentally. Contrary to T. brucei, VSGs from T. congolense have no cysteines in their C-terminal domains (7Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Rausch S. Shayan P. Salnikoff J. Reinwald E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the typical cysteine-based classification of C-terminal domains is not possible in these VSGs. Interestingly, the B domain disulfide-bond pattern is compatible with the gross A domain tertiary structure. Fig. 2 shows ribbon drawings of the two N-terminal domains of T. brucei A-type VSGs ILTat 1.24 and MITat 1.2. The positions of the cysteines are indicated bysquares. Superimposed are the approximate positions of B VSG-characteristic cysteines (dots). The disulfide bond 16/236 in the B domain corresponds to the A domain-specific disulfide bonds 15/152 (ILTat 1.25) or 15/145 (MITat 1.2). Depending on the actual turn of the α-helices within the stem region of the N domain, Cys16 in B domains could well point to the opposite direction as does Cys15 in A domains, being able to form a bond to Cys236. The second A domain typical disulfide bond 129/209 (ILTat 1.24) or 123/187 (MITat 1.2) is located near the top of the molecule at the cell surface connecting two short secondary structure-poor loop regions of the chain. The two B domain disulfide bonds (171/193 and 195/206) are located within this region as well, stabilizing peptide loops at the cell surface similar to the corresponding disulfide bond in A domains. However, the cystine bonds within this region of the B domain cannot be fully integrated into the A domain-typical surface loops. At least Cys171 and Cys193 would be too far apart to become bound to each other. Therefore, one has to assume that the surface loops of B domain VSGs are not as similar to those of A domains as probably are the stem regions of the two VSG types. The final disulfide bond in B domains connects cysteines 286 and 298. In A domains this region corresponds to sequence segments characterized by short α-helices interconnected by several peptide loops near the foot of the VSG stem region. As seen in Fig. 2 no structural change has to occur in this region to form a bond between Cys286 and Cys298. Taken together, the disulfide-bonding pattern of B domains can be easily integrated into the A domain tertiary structure. The major difference probably resides within the surface-oriented loop regions. It is exactly this region that also contains a substantial part of the tertiary structure differences between the two A domain VSGs ILTat 1.24 and MITat 1.2 (11Blum M.L. Down J.A. Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The tip of the VSG molecules might be used to produce a variety of structures, not only differing between members of the same domain type but also between those of different domain types. The variable surface structures might reflect different surface properties of bloodstream trypanosomes. It is known that, contrary toT. brucei, bloodstream T. congolense can be agglutinated by lectins (15Jackson P.R. Honigberg B.M. Holt S.C. J. Protozool. 1978; 25: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Rautenberg P. Reinwald E. Risse H.-J. Parasitology. 1980; 80: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and are able to bind to erythrocytes (17Banks K.L. J. Protozool. 1979; 26: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (18Banks K.L. J. Protozool. 1978; 25: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Shakibaei M. Milaninezhad M. Risse H.-J. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 112: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Hemphill A. Ross C.A. Parasitol. Res. 1995; 81: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The latter effect is restricted to the flagellar region and is certainly not produced by VSGs (19Shakibaei M. Milaninezhad M. Risse H.-J. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 112: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The surface structures of VSGs, however, might model the cell surface such to allow adhesion molecules within the surface coat their specific interaction with corresponding cells but preventing access of antibody molecules to these common and invariable surface antigens. The long known phenomenon of autoagglutination of bloodstream forms of T. congolense might be produced by the B domain-specific surface structures as well. The primary amino acid sequences next to the cysteines 193/195 are rather strongly conserved between variants (8Rausch S. Shayan P. Salnikoff J. Reinwald E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Even if this part of the amino acid chain is located near the cell surface, it does not form antigenic determinants, which would be invariable and counteracting antigenic variation. The conserved amino acids are probably not exposed but necessary to form contacts to neighboring surface loops in order to maintain a specific variant-independent surface structure. Anti-VSG sera produced by immunizing animals with isolated VSG fail to react with living trypanosomes (21Masterson W.J. Taylor D. Turner M.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3194-3199PubMed Google Scholar). By epitope mapping with polyclonal anti-VSG sera, we know that VSG molecules generally are highly immunogenic, and many sequence-type antigenic determinants are distributed along the chain (data not shown). However, none of these determinants is accessible at the cell surface. It seems, that cell-surface antigenic determinants are formed by short amino acid stretches of different but closely neighbored VSG molecules of the surface coat. Disrupting the coat (by isolation of VSG) destroys these determinants. This would explain both the unreactiveness to living cells of anti-VSG antibodies raised by immunization with isolated VSG and the fact that surface-reacting antibodies can only be obtained by immunizing animals with living or X-irradiated trypanosomes (21Masterson W.J. Taylor D. Turner M.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3194-3199PubMed Google Scholar). In T. brucei non-VSG cell-surface proteins have been identified showing cysteine patterns similar to A domain VSGs (22Carrington M. Boothroyd J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar),i.e. ISG65 and ISG75 (invariant surface glycoprotein 65 and 75) (23Ziegelbauer K. Multhaup G. Overath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10797-10803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ESAG6 and ESAG7 (expression-site-associated gene 6 and 7 products) (24Pays E. Tebabi P. Pays A. Coquelet H. Revelard P. Salmon D. Steinert M. Cell. 1989; 57: 835-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and human serum resistance associated protein (25De Greef C. Hamers R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A structural similarity to VSGs is considered to be a prerequisite to become embedded into the surface coat (22Carrington M. Boothroyd J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This suggests that the tertiary structure of VSGs (the VSG-fold) is not limited to VSGs and is likely present in invariant trypanosomal surface proteins too. To date, no information is available on invariant cell-surface proteins of T. congolense (surface coat with B domain VSGs). Due to deviating surface properties of the two trypanosome species (see above), compared with T. brucei other invariant surface proteins might exist within the surface coat of T. congolense. To shield them from immunological attack by host antibodies, slight structural modifications of the utmost VSG parts might therefore be necessary. During the course of this investigation, we became aware of discrepancies between the cDNA sequence data of BENat 1.3 VSG published earlier (8Rausch S. Shayan P. Salnikoff J. Reinwald E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the actual amino acid sequences. At least four differences were observed. More differences might exist because only parts of the protein were sequenced. The cDNA-predicted isoleucine at position 212 was replaced by a valine, the asparagine at 290 by a lysine, and the serine at 293 by an asparagine. The fourth discrepancy of 16Da occurs in tryptic peptide 5 but was not resolved by sequencing (see “Results”). The three identified exchanges can be explained by point mutations. Thus, the isoleucine codon AUC could be converted to the valine codon GUC, the asparagine codon AAU to the lysine codon AAG, and the serine codon AGC to the asparagine codon AAC. Similarly, the fourth discrepancy could be explained by a conversion of Glu216 (codon GAA) to Asp (codon GAU or GAC) leading to a mass reduction of 14 Da. The autoradiographies of the sequencing gels of the original BENat 1.3-cDNA were still available, and a re-evaluation confirmed the earlier published data. Also available was the original cDNA, which was resequenced, and again, no deviations to the published sequence could be found (data not shown). Thus, clearly the published BENat 1.3 cDNA sequence was correct. It is known that trypanosomes have a high potential to induce point mutations. This has been demonstrated previously at the 3′ ends of VSG genes (26Rice-Ficht A.C. Chen K.K. Donelson J.E. Nature. 1982; 298: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has, to a lesser extent, also been found in other regions of the VSG genes, and it has recently even been detected in a foreign gene introduced into T. brucei (27Valdes J. Taylor M.C. Cross M.A. Lightenberg M.J.L. Rudenko G. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1809-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mutation rate of T. brucei has been calculated to be 12 times higher than in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa, and it has been suggested that this phenomenon might be related to the requirement for diversity among the VSG genes on which the trypanosome depends for survival (27Valdes J. Taylor M.C. Cross M.A. Lightenberg M.J.L. Rudenko G. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1809-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It can therefore be assumed that a trypanosome clone derived from a single cell will not remain homogeneous but will be continually changed by point mutations in its gene(s). The diverging sequence data of the cloned BENat 1.3 cDNA and the present protein can be explained by assuming that originally one (a minor one) of several existing VSG cDNAs was sequenced, whereas the amino acid sequences of the current VSG reveal the most prominent species. Interestingly, the observed amino acid exchanges occur in regions of the molecule, at least with respect to the A domain structure, which are not exposed at the cell surface. Therefore, the antigenicity of the trypanosomes did not change. If point mutations would occur in a region of the VSG gene coding for surface-exposed parts of the protein, a change in the antigenicity of the VSG (and in the trypanosome) could be possible. Such an effect has been observed in Trypanosoma equiperdum (28Baltz T. Bringaud F. Eisen H. Jaquemot C. Roth C.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Antigenicity changes by point mutations might occur more frequently than currently believed and could well contribute significantly to the antigenic variability potential of African trypanosomes.

Sickle cell disease is caused by the mutation of human hemoglobin (HbA)1 at the sixth position of the β chain from glutamate to valine (1Ingram V.M. Nature. 1956; 178: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The consequence of this single amino acid substitution is a drastically reduced solubility of deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) leading to the formation of long polymers that distort and rigidify the normally pliable erythrocytes. Such sickled cells can occlude the capillaries of the microcirculation and decrease the oxygen supply to the surrounding tissue, which is believed to be what is responsible for the clinical manifestations of sickle-cell disease. Structural analysis of HbS fibers using single crystal x-ray diffraction, fiber x-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy, as well as complementary information from gelation experiments, has established the basic fiber architecture (2Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Crystals of deoxy-HbS grown in low salt at low pH (5.0 to 6.0) display a monoclinic space group in which hemoglobin molecules are assembled in double strands (3Wishner B.C. Ward K.B. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Axial contacts within each strand and lateral contacts between strands that involve the mutated β6 Val stabilize these “Wishner-Love” double strands (3Wishner B.C. Ward K.B. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 4Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8280-8291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural details of the double strand interactions have been elucidated from the refined structure of HbS at 2.05-Å resolution (5Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). X-ray fiber diffraction data, from both extracellular gels and sickled erythrocytes, are consistent with a similar arrangement of molecules in the crystal and fiber (6Magdoff-Fairchild B. Chiu C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy with image reconstruction has revealed that the basic HbS fiber is 210-Å thick and formed from 14 filament strands that associate as half-staggered pairs (7Dykes G.W. Crepeau R.H. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 451-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although some disagreements exist as to the arrangement of the double strands within the HbS fiber (8Cretegny I. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), there is broad agreement that the basic building block of the fiber is a Wishner-Love double strand with a slight helical twist. Additional convincing evidence that the crystalline double strand is physiologically relevant comes from copolymerization studies of HbS with naturally occurring variants (10Benesch R.E. Kwong S. Benesch R. Nature. 1982; 299: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Nagel R.L. Johnson J. Bookchin R.M. Garel M.C. Rosa J. Schiliro G. Wajcman H. Labie D. Moo-Penn W. Castro O. Nature. 1980; 283: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These experiments show significant changes in polymerization properties as a result of altering residues that participate in the crystal double strand contacts. In contrast, most mutations of residues not involved in double strand contacts do not lead to alterations of the polymerization properties (2Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). To probe the polymerization reaction, site-directed mutants of the β chains of HbA have been made using HbA overexpression systems developed in bacteria (12Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and yeast (13Wagenbach M. O'Rourke K. Vitez L. Wieczorek A. Hoffman S. Durfee S. Tedesco J. Stetler G. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A number of mutations at the β6 position have been characterized (14Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J.

Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Polymerization is promoted with mutations of β6 Glu → Leu and β6 Glu → Ile, whereas mutation of β6 Glu → Trp (Hbβ6W) and β6 Glu → Phe results in lower polymerization relative to HbS, albeit without the delay period characteristic of HbS polymerization (14Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the structural basis for the striking inhibition of polymerization with a significantly larger residue at β6 (Trp, Phe), we have determined the crystal structure of Hbβ6W. This structure helps explain the polymerization behavior and provides insight into HbS polymerization. Recombinant human hemoglobin containing tryptophan at the β6 position was expressed in yeast and purified as described previously (14Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deoxy-Hbβ6W was crystallized in a similar manner to that of deoxy-HbS (5Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), with several modifications. Twinned crystals initially formed in batch solutions containing 4–7 μl of 33% PEG 8000, 5 μl of 200 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.8), and 10 μl of hemoglobin solution containing 160 mg/ml Hbβ6W suspended in 30 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Several crystals from this setup were stabilized in a 2-ml solution containing 11.6% PEG 8000 and 50 mm sodium citrate, then crushed in preparation for microseeding. The crushed crystal solution was serially diluted 3125-fold, and 1 μl was added to a batch crystallization setup containing 10 μl Hbβ6W (160 mg/ml), 5 μl of 33% PEG 8000, 5 μl of 200 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.8). Single crystals grew directly from solution after several hours, instead of from gelled hemoglobin, as in the case of HbS. Crystals of Hbβ6W were very radiation sensitive, and had to be frozen under deoxygenated conditions before mounting. Prior to freezing, crystals were allowed to equilibrate with a stabilizing solution containing 11.6% (w/w) PEG 8000 (Fluka), 10 mm 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (Sigma), 75 mmbis-Tris (pH 7.0) (Sigma), and several grains of sodium dithionite (Hoechst-Celanese, Charlotte, NC) for 1 day, then placed in a freezing solution containing 45% PEG 20,000 (Fluka), 10 mm2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, 50 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol, and several grains of sodium dithionite for another day. Crystals equilibrated in this solution were scooped up in nylon loops mounted on pins (Yale Medical Inst. Facility, New Haven, CT) and frozen in liquid propane placed in 2 ml Corning Cryovials (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The cryovials were then plunged into liquid nitrogen, which solidifies the propane, permitting mounting of the frozen crystals in a cooled nitrogen cold stream (Molecular Structure Corp., The Woodlands, TX). All these manipulations, as well as the crystallization, were performed in an anaerobic chamber (Anaerobe Systems, Santa Clara, CA), and placement of the frozen crystal in the cooled nitrogen (approximately 100 K) stream kept the crystal deoxygenated. Data were collected on an RAXIS-IIC image plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator (Molecular Structure Corp.) operating at 50 kV, 100 mA. The crystals diffracted to better than 2.0-Å resolution, and a data set was collected from a single crystal. The crystal displayed P212121 symmetry and unit cell dimensions of a = 62.95 Å, b = 81.28 Å, and c = 111.35 Å. A data set comprised of 70 oscillations yielded 112,861 observed reflections, of which 35,597 were unique. These data were 89.2% complete to 2.0 Å, with anR sym of 7.6%. The structure of Hbβ6W was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The deoxygenated HbA structure (19Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) was stripped of solvent and the B-factors set to 8.0 Å2 in preparation for its use as the initial search model. Data between 8.0 and 4.0 Å were used in the search. A single, unambiguous solution was obtained, with a correlation coefficient of 70.4 and an initial R-factor of 33.5% following rigid body refinement with AMORE. Deoxy-human hemoglobin (19Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) was mutated to contain β6 Trp, and the solution matrix from AMORE was applied to its coordinates before using it as the initial model for refinement. Powell minimization and overall B-factor (singleB-factor for all atoms in structure) refinement was performed against 20.0–3.0-Å data using the program XPLOR (20Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). 10% of the data was set aside for use as a free R test set (21Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3854) Google Scholar). The resolution was increased in 0.25-Å increments, with refinement performed as above, until data from 20.0 to 2.0 Å was included in the refinement. After these refinement runs, the free R-factor dropped from 38.4 to 35.1%, and the R-factor fell from 38.6 to 31.1%. At this time, a simulated annealing protocol was performed that further dropped the free R to 34.8% and the conventional R to 29.0%. To this structure, a shell of water was added using density greater than 4.0 ς in Fo − Fc maps. At this time, individual B-factors were refined, and another simulated annealing was performed with fixed water molecule positions. Subsequently, eight shells of water were added, using first 4.0 ς, then 3.5 ς density in Fo −Fc maps. After each shell placement, positional and B-factor refinement was performed, followed by model building with O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Next a bulk solvent correction was applied, and a final shell of water was added to corrected maps, followed by positional refinement. Crystals of deoxy-Hbβ6W grew under similar conditions to HbS, but formed directly from solution rather than forming a gel first as in deoxy-HbS crystallization. These crystals have 1 hemoglobin tetramer per asymmetric unit and resemble crystal forms of HbC (23Fitzgerald P.M.D. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 603-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and HbM Iwate (24Greer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 59: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Data collection required flash freezing of crystals, under anaerobic conditions, to prevent the significant radiation damage that occurred when these crystals were exposed to x-rays at room temperature. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and has been refined to a final R-factor of 19.8%, with a freeR of 26.4%, and excellent stereochemistry (TableI). A Luzzati plot (25Luzzati P.V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) suggests an upper limit for the overall positional error of the model to be approximately 0.23 Å (data not shown).Table IData collection and refinement statistics on Hbβ6WResolution limits (Å)20–2.0Total observations112,861Unique reflections35,597R sym(%)7.6%Completeness (%)89.2%Number of reflections used in refinement (F > 2ς)35,002 R-factor0.198Number of reflections used forR free (F > 2ς)2,112 R free0.264Number of non-hydrogen atoms: Hemoglobin4,566 Solvent368r.m.s. deviation from ideality: Bond lengths (Å)0.011 Bond angles (°)1.829 Impropers (°)1.586Average temperature factors: Protein (Å2)14.0 Water (Å2)22.7 Open table in a new tab In the crystal lattice of Hbβ6W, tetramers are arranged in double strands that run along the crystallographic a axis, as in crystals of HbS. However, the nature of these double strands is fundamentally different from those of HbS. The double strands of Hbβ6W and HbS are shown in Fig. 1. The differences become apparent upon strand alignment. When double strands of Hbβ6W are aligned with double strands of HbS, only very poor agreement is obtained as indicated by an r.m.s. deviation of 6.38 Å for α-carbon atoms and 6.29 Å for all atoms. However, if tetramers are aligned as single strands, quite good agreement is found with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.64 Å for α-carbon atoms and 1.09 Å for all atoms. Thus, the arrangement of molecules in single strands is very similar in the two crystal structures, but the association of pairs of strands is different for Hbβ6W and HbS. The similarity of single stands of Hbβ6W and HbS is reflected in an analysis of the axial contacts between molecules within a single strand. A view of the axial contact is shown in Fig. 2 a, which is quite similar to that of HbS (see Fig. 7 of Harrington et al. (5Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). The Hbβ6W contact contains more water molecules than the HbS axial contacts, possibly because of the presence of more ordered water molecules in the frozen crystal. The distances between atoms across this interface are comparable with the distances in HbS, particularly around the core hydrophobic interactions involving α2Pro-114 and α2 Ala-115 (TableII).Table IIAxial contactsResiduesHbSHbβ6WStrand 1Strand 2Åα1Pro-114 (O)-α2Lys-16 (Nζ)3.365.853.10α1 Ala-115 (Cα)-α2Lys-16 (Cε)4.81*3.744.79*α1 Pro-114 (Cβ)-α2Glu-116 (Oε1)3.713.923.38β1 Gly-16 (O)-β2 Lys-120 (Nζ)3.084.69*6.99*β1 Gly-16 (O)-β2 Lys-120 (Cε)4.20*3.466.84*β1 Lys-17 (Cγ)-β2 Phe-118 (O)3.763.913.72β1 Lys-17 (Nζ)-β2His-117 (O)2.863.422.93β1 Lys-17 (Nζ)-β2 His-116 (O)6.12*3.422.89β1 Val-18 (O)-β2 Lys-120 (Nζ)3.212.936.01*β1 Glu-22 (Oε2)-α2 His-20 (Nε2)3.554.856.38β1 His-117 (O)-α2 Pro-114 (Cγ)3.363.473.74*β1 His-117 (O)-α2 Ala-115 (Cβ)3.373.263.63*β1 Phe-118 (C)-α2 Ala-115 (Cβ)3.823.693.88β1 Phe-118 (Cδ1)-α2 Pro-114 (Cγ)3.923.553.94*β1 Gly-119 (N)-α2 Ala-115 (Cβ)3.783.633.84β1 Glu-121 (Oε2)-α2 Pro-114 (Cβ)3.713.794.58Residues closer than 4.0 Å are included with distances shown only for those atoms making the closest contact for each residue pair except those designated with an asterisk, for which a closer atom pair is present.

In contrast to the axial contacts, lateral contacts between strands are quite distinct in Hbβ6W and HbS. Lateral contacts in both are formed between the A helix of a β subunit on one tetramer, termed the donor subunit, and a pocket formed by the E and F helices of a β subunit on a second tetramer, termed the acceptor pocket. In each tetramer, one β subunit acts as a donor and the other β subunit is an acceptor. Donor subunits in the HbS double strands are designated as β2, whereas acceptors are designated as β1subunits (5Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Alignment of single strands in Hbβ6W and HbS reveals a reversal of the roles of the β subunits in contact formation. β2 subunits provide the acceptor pockets in the lateral contact of Hbβ6W, whereas the donor subunit is β1. A view of the Hbβ6W lateral contact is depicted in Fig. 2 b. The residues of the donor chain are displayed asmagenta bonds poised above the acceptor pocket. Comparison of Fig. 2 b with Fig. 5 of Harrington et al. (5Harrington D.J. Adachi K. Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) shows a shift in donor subunit position, with β1 Pro-5 of Hbβ6W situated in the acceptor pocket in approximately the same position as the valine in HbS. The larger size of the β6 Trp prevents its packing in the EF pocket in a similar manner to β6 Val in HbS, however, it does participate peripherally with its ζ3 carbon packed against β2 Phe-85 (see also TableIII). The differences can be seen with the stereo representation of the two lateral contacts shown in Fig. 3. Note the different angle of the A helices and the lack of interaction with the H helix in the Hbβ6W contact. Table IV provides a comparison of lateral contact distances in HbS and Hbβ6W.Table IIIHbβ6W lateral contactResiduesÅβ1His-2 (Nε2)-β2Asp-73 (Oδ2)3.33β1His-4 (Cγ2)-β2Asp-73 (Cγ)3.59β1Pro-5 (Cδ)-β2Asp-73 (Oδ2)3.74β1Pro-5 (Cβ)-β2Leu-88 (Cδ1)3.67β1Pro-5 (Cγ)-β2Ala-70 (Cβ)3.60β1Trp-6 (Cε3)-β2Thr-84 (O)2.89β1Trp-6 (Nε1)-β2His-77 (Cε1)3.19β1Trp-6 (Cζ2)-β2Asp-73 (O)3.23β1Trp-6 (Cζ3)-β2Phe-85 (Cε1)3.85β1Trp-6 (Cη2)-β2Ala-70 (O)3.50β1Trp-6 (Cη2)-β2Gly-74 (O)3.38β1Ser-9 (Oγ)-β2Thr-87 (Cγ2)2.91Residues closer than 4.0 Å are included with distances shown only for those atoms making the closest contact for each residue pair.

The individual hemoglobin tetramers are quite similar in Hbβ6W, HbS, and HbA, as indicated in Table V. The most significant difference in structures is found in the disposition of the A helix in the donor (β2) subunit in HbS and results in slightly higher r.m.s. deviations for HbS. In the HbS double strand, lateral contact formation is coupled with a movement of the A helix toward the H helix in the donor subunit, relative to its position in HbA β chains or the HbS acceptor (β1) subunits. No such movement of the A helix is observed to occur in donor (β1) subunits upon formation of the lateral contact in Hbβ6W crystals.Table VRoot mean squared differences (Å) between tetramersHbAHbS 1HbS 2HbS tetramer 10.59 (1.01)HbS tetramer 20.57 (0.96)0.32 (0.65)Hbβ6W0.36 (0.90)0.54 (1.02)0.53 (0.97)The individual tetramers found in the structures of deoxy-HbA (19Fermi G.

We undertook the structural analysis of deoxy-Hbβ6W to investigate the basis for its altered polymerization properties relative to HbS and to gain insight into the polymerization of HbS. The complicated polymerization kinetics of deoxy-HbS (26Ferrone R.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 193: 611-631Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar) reflects the fact that fiber formation requires the interplay of multiple interactions between tetramers. Our results reveal details of a new mode of assembly available to human hemoglobin when the β6 position is occupied by a residue with an aromatic side chain. The interactions leading to this assembly may play a role in HbS polymerization. A prominent feature of the crystals of deoxy-Hbβ6W is a double strand of hemoglobin tetramers that shares many structural characteristics with the HbS double strand. The individual strands of HbS and Hbβ6W molecules can be superimposed nearly identically. In addition, both double strands are stabilized by lateral contacts between the A helix of a β-subunit on one tetramer with the EF pocket of a β-subunit on another tetramer. However, the size of tryptophan β6 prevents it from packing into the EF pocket in the same manner as does β6 Val. As a result, an alternate lateral contact is formed in which β6 Trp participates peripherally whereas β5 Pro packs into the EF pocket at nearly the same position as HbS β6 Val. The alternate lateral contact in Hbβ6W is characterized by significantly less surface area buried than the HbS lateral contact (Table VI). Interestingly, the water molecules located between the F and F′ helices are conserved in the lateral contacts, which may be useful for design of anti-sickling agents that bind in the acceptor pocket. The inability of the bulky tryptophan residue to pack tightly into the acceptor pocket results in altered polymerization properties and formation of an alternate double strand assemblage. Unlike HbS, crystals of Hbβ6W grew directly from solution, suggesting that the mutation precludes gel formation. Such an alternate polymerization reaction is consistent with the lack of a delay time prior to polymerization as observed in high phosphate experiments (14Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double strand observed in crystals of Hbβ6W, although similar to that of HbS, is fundamentally different. In both double strands, one β subunit on each tetramer acts as a donor, and the other β subunit provides an acceptor pocket leaving another donor/acceptor pair within each tetramer unbound and exposed to solvent. Based on alignment of single strands, donor and acceptor β subunits are reversed in the two double strands (see Fig. 4). The different roles of β subunits in the two double strands suggests the possibility that both modes of association could occur simultaneously and contribute to formation of the HbS fiber. Fig. 4shows the formation of the two double strands as they would associate with a single strand. As can be seen, all three strands can coexist, albeit with slight interpenetration. Additionally, a four-stranded assemblage can be modeled by aligning one strand of HbS with theblue strand of Hbβ6W shown in Fig. 4. Although there is slight interpenetration between the two parallel double strands assembled in this way, the clashes are minimal and are reduced by application of the right-handed twist (27Lewis M.R. Lee T.E. Josephs R. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) found in the HbS fiber. It is interesting to note that parallel pairs of double strands have been observed as part of the 14-stranded HbS fiber (8Cretegny I. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Watowich S.J. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the interactions seen in the Hbβ6W double strand could contribute to formation of multiple fibers as described by the heterogeneous nucleation model (26Ferrone R.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 193: 611-631Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This would provide another possible mode of nucleation, related to that proposed by Mirchev and Ferrone (28Mirchev R. Ferrone F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such interactions result from one strand (the single strand represented as a molecular surface) utilizing both acceptor pockets and both donor regions, unlike the crystal structures. The crystal structure of Hbβ6W provides evidence for the stereospecific importance of side-chains at the β6 position of human hemoglobin in promoting the formation of certain double strands. Additionally, this structure may represent a model for physiologically relevant contacts within the fibers, or model interactions responsible for promotion of heterogeneous nucleation. Conserved features in the structures of HbS and Hbβ6W, particularly with regard to solvent structure, could be exploited in the design of sickling inhibitors. Together, these models provide important building blocks for future studies aimed at elucidating the structure of HbS fibers at atomic resolution, which may ultimately contribute to the design of specific inhibitors for HbS polymerization.

Epidemiological studies suggesting a causal link between magnetic field exposure from 60-Hz power lines and childhood leukemia have focused attention on the possible molecular mechanisms by which 60-Hz electric and magnetic fields (EMFs)1 may contribute to childhood leukemia. However, mechanistic research is complicated by the lack of established biomarkers of exposure or response. Although various biophysical mechanisms have been proposed, there is no generally accepted mechanism for the biological effects of EMFs (3Valberg P.A. Kavet R. Rafferty C.N. Radiat.

However, our understanding of the interaction of weak magnetic fields with biological systems is severely limited by the lack of well understood model systems that have been shown to respond to EMF exposure.Exposure of human B-lineage leukemia cells to a 1-gauss 60-Hz EMF resulted in an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation profile of substrate proteins and in LYN and SYK protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) activation, followed by protein kinase C stimulation (5Uckun F.M.

We have exploited infectious clones of the plant pararetrovirus cauliflower mosaic virus carrying redundant ectopic plus-strand priming elements to study priming in vivo. Ectopic priming generated an additional discontinuity in progeny virion DNA during infection of plants. We found that altering the length of the 13-base pair PPT by ±25% significantly reduced priming efficiency. A short pyrimidine tract 5′ to the PPT, highly conserved among diverse reverse-transcribing elements, was shown to play an important role in PPT recognition in vivo. The predominant DNA plus-strand 5′ end remained 3 nucleotides from the PPT 3′ end in mutant primers that were longer or shorter than the wild-type primer. Use of an ectopic redundant primer to study replication-dependent priming was validated by demonstrating that it could rescue infectivity following destruction of the wild-type priming elements.

Retro-elements (REs),1the propagation of which involves copying genomic RNA into DNA mediated by reverse transcriptase (RT), are found in organisms representing the major groups of eukaryotes. REs include animal retroviruses, animal and plant pararetroviruses, and retrotransposable elements (1Hull R. Covey S.N. Virus Genes. 1996; 11: 105-118Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although REs are diverse, most share several common features. Important among these is the pol gene product specifying multiple enzyme activities associated with reverse transcriptase (RT) involved in RE DNA synthesis and processing (2Gabriel A. Boeke J.D. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 275-328Google Scholar, 3Coffin J.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Channock R.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T.M. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1767-1847Google Scholar). REs have a different origin of replication for synthesis of each strand of the double-stranded (ds)DNA phase. First, reverse transcription of the genomic RNA into minus-strand DNA is initiated in most REs by a host tRNA (4Mak J. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8087-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During minus-strand synthesis, RT-associated RNase H activity degrades the RNA template (5Whitcomb J.M. Hughes S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 275-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This degradation appears to occur in at least two stages. Processive DNA minus-strand synthesis is accompanied by a polymerase-dependent, non-processive RNase H degradation of the template leaving RNA fragments. These fragments are probably further degraded by subsequent polymerase-independent RNase H cleavages (7Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 406-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 9Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The RNA primer for DNA plus-strand synthesis is generated during these steps by RNase H cleavage at a specific site called the polypurine tract (PPT), 13–18 nucleotides long. For REs producing an integrating linear double-stranded DNA with long terminal repeats (LTRs), precision of plus-strand initiation is essential for RE viability as one LTR border is defined by this step. Therefore, understanding the role of the PPT is important, particularly in retroviruses where plus-strand initiation is a possible target for therapeutic control. Several studies of PPT function have involved analysis of products made by RT added to RNA primer/DNA template combinations in vitro(10Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2843-2851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but it is not clear how such reactions relate to plus-strand priming in vivo. Mutagenesis of the LTR-associated PPT could render an RE non-functional in vivo limiting usefulness of this approach. Members of the lentivirus and spumavirus groups of retroviruses, and the yeast retrotransposon Ty1, have a second central PPT colinear with the pol gene (14Harris J.D. Scott J.V. Traynor B. Brahic M.

Studies have shown that mutations in the pol-associated PPT, leaving the colinearpol amino acid sequence unchanged, impaired priming and retroviral replication in transfected cells (17Hungnes O. Tjøta E. Grinde B. Virology. 1992; 190: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J.

Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also inserted a 29-bp linker containing the PPT sequence into a new site in the HIV-1 genome, where it primed DNA plus-strand synthesis. With this approach, the primer could be moved potentially to a new genome site for analysis without interference from colinear functions. Plant pararetroviruses, such as cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), offer great potential to study plus-strand priming because clones of their circular double-stranded DNA genome can be infectious to plants, and, some members of the group have multiple PPT-associated priming sites (19Covey S.N. Hull R. Davies J.W. Wilson T.M.A. Genetic Engineering with Plant Viruses. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 217-249Google Scholar). Different plant pararetroviruses have 1–3 PPTs close to virion DNA discontinuities, which are structurally similar to the HIV-1pol-associated DNA discontinuity (Fig. 1). CaMV has two PPTs; one is colinear with a non-essential gene and can be deleted without loss of viral infectivity (20Howarth A.J. Gardner R.C. Messing J. Shepherd R.J.

Gene (Amst .). 1985; 33: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown that plus-strand priming can be initiated in vivo by insertion of a PPT at an ectopic genome site (27Noad R.J. Turner D.S. Covey S.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These features have enabled us to investigate the pararetroviral plus-strand priming mechanism in vivo. CaMV isolates used were Cabb B-JI and Aust (21Al-Kaff N.S. Covey S.N. J. Gen.

Celite abrasive was supplied by Celite Corp. pGEM cloning vectors were from Promega. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene). Primer extension was performed with the T7 sequencing kit supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Turnip seedlings were grown in a greenhouse (minimum day length, 16 h) at 20 °C. Plants were mechanically inoculated using Celite abrasive with sap from infected plants, or cloned viral DNA constructs (1–4 μg/plant) digested with a restriction enzyme to liberate viral DNA from the cloning vector. Symptoms were scored when consistent on a minimum of 4 plants. Molecular biological manipulations were based upon those described by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Artificial plus-strand primers, (+)ps elements, were made by annealing pairs of complementary, 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides (Table I, oligonucleotides 1–28) generating terminalNheI sites. The annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into the unique NheI site introduced into infectious CaMV 35 S promoter deletion mutants M4 and M10 (29Turner D.S. McCallum D.G. Covey S.N. J.

For the (+)ps1 element colinear with gene V, the clone MP12 (27Noad R.J. Turner D.S. Covey S.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was digested with PstI and the fragment (3430–5386) containing the cloning vector (pGEM5) inserted at the uniqueSalI site (4836), and the site to be mutated (∼4210), was self-ligated and cloned. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange procedure with mutagenic oligonucleotides (Table I, oligonucleotides 29 and 30). The mutation was checked by sequencing, and an NaeI fragment (pGEM5 site to CaMV site 3910) containing the change was isolated and used to replace the wild-type fragment in the full-length CaMV clone pBJI5Sal, generating clone PB1. The (+)ps2 priming element colinear with gene II was mutated by exploiting the adjacent uniqueXhoI site to design an oligonucleotide containing this site and the mutations (Table I, oligonucleotide 31). A fragment was amplified between this and an upstream site (740–761), and anNsiI-XhoI fragment (1042–1644) was isolated from the PCR product. This fragment was used to replace a similar fragment in a BstEII (126)-XhoI subclone of the CaMV genome (producing clone BB5) and this, in turn, replaced the wild-type fragment generating the full-length clone BB8. The (+)ps2 sequence was also deleted using a strategy similar to that for BB8 but employing an oligonucleotide with a 33-bp in-frame deletion (Table I, oligonucleotide 32) relative to the wild-type CaMV sequence, generating clone BB12. Clone BB9, containing both mutant (+)ps elements, was made by replacing the BstEII/XhoI-cut fragment from BB8 with that from BB5 producing clone BB9. A mutant genome containing the modified (+)ps1 and the deleted (+)ps2 was created by replacing theSpeI(110)-XhoI fragment of PB1 with that from BB12 producing clone BB21. Construct PM1 comprised the deleted gene II region of CaMV isolate CM4–184, the mutated (+)ps1 element, and a linker in the 35 S promoter. PM1 was made by ligating the 3.0-kbStuI fragment from clone MP12 (27Noad R.J. Turner D.S. Covey S.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to the complementary 7.6-kb StuI fragment of clone PB1. Construct GG5 was a modification of PM1 in which an artificial (+)ps element (Table I, oligonucleotides 1–2) was introduced in forward orientation into theNheI linker in the 35 S promoter. All mutations introduced into the viral genome were checked by sequencing before infection and after recovery from plants if constructs were infectious. Priming of DNA plus-strand synthesis was determined by detecting discontinuities in CaMV virion DNA purified as described by Covey et al. (30Covey S.N., R.J. Noad R.J. Al-Kaff N.S. Turner D.S. Taylor S.C. Foster G. Methods in Molecular Biology: Plant Virology Protocols: From Virus Isolation to Transgenic Resistance. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 53-64Google Scholar). Denaturing gel electrophoresis of CaMV virion DNA and detection by blot-hybridization was as described by Noad et al. (27Noad R.J. Turner D.S. Covey S.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Efficiency of plus-strand priming at the ectopic site (+)ps3 was determined semiquantitatively by scanning autoradiograms following denaturing Southern blot analysis. Scanned lanes were analyzed using ImageQuant software to integrate peak areas. Precise determination of DNA plus-strand 5′ ends was by primer extension using appropriate primers upstream of the (+)ps2 and (+)ps3 elements, respectively. Primer extension was performed on 1–2 μg of virion DNA using the method described by Medberry et al. (31Medberry S.L. Lockhart B.E.L. Olszewski N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5505-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have adopted a new descriptor for plant pararetroviral plus-strand priming sequences, (+)ps, since the term PPT is an incomplete definition and previous abbreviations in plant pararetroviruses referred to virion DNA gaps rather than priming elements themselves. The two authentic CaMV (+)ps elements are co-linear with viral genes (Fig. 1). The CaMV reverse transcriptase gene (gene V) contains (+)ps1, and the aphid transmission protein gene (gene II) contains (+)ps2. Although gene II is not essential for viral replication and can be deleted, our studies 2N. Al-Kaff, D. Turner, and S. Covey, unpublished observations. of (+)ps2 have shown that mutagenesis can interfere with co-linear functions affecting CaMV pathogenicity. To circumvent this problem, we exploited our discovery that a redundant 31-bp copy of (+)ps2 inserted into the CaMV 35 S promoter (Figs. 1 A and2 A) efficiently primes DNA plus-strands during infection of plants with no detected effect on viral pathogenicity (27Noad R.J. Turner D.S. Covey S.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our assay for functionality of the inserted primer is to measure generation of a new discontinuity in progeny CaMV DNA. Following denaturing gel electrophoresis, virion DNA of the M4 vector, lacking the inserted priming element (Fig. 2 A), resolves as three major single-stranded fragments (Fig. 2 B) comprising the genome-length product of minus-strand priming (α-strand, 8 kb), and two fragments resulting from plus-strand priming at (+)ps1 (β-strand, 5.4 kb) and (+)ps2 (γ-strand, 2.6 kb). A 3.8-kb fragment (β′-strand) is a product of failed second strand transfer during reverse transcription (Fig. 2, B and C). The presence of an additional primer in the 35 S promoter, in vector M4Gf, produces a new discontinuity in the β-strand (Fig. 3). The efficiency of priming at the new site was measured in denaturing gels by assessing the reduction in amount of the 5.4-kb single-stranded DNA fragment and replacement by two additional fragments of 3.1 and 2.3 kb. The amount of residual β-strand DNA in M4Gf shows that priming at the new site is less than 100% effective. By scanning gels, integrating the peak areas (see Fig. 2 B), and comparing amounts of β-strand, we estimate that the new priming site mediated by oligonucleotide (+)ps3:o (TableI) is recognized in 85–90% of virion DNA molecules.Figure 3Ectopic priming in vivo by mutant primers.

The relative priming activities (RA) were expressed as a percentage of that produced by the full-length primer (o); nd, not detected.B, denaturing gel and blot-hybridization analysis of CaMV virion DNA from plants infected with M4Gf carrying variant (+)ps elements. Priming activity was determined by comparing the relative amounts of the γ and δ bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relative activity of mutant (+)ps elements was then tested at the ectopic site (Fig. 3). This was quantified by comparing the intensity of the 3.1-kb band (δ-strand) with that of the 2.6-kb band (γ-strand) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both of the authentic CaMV (+)ps elements have a similar organization, although the sequences differ slightly. In each case, the PPT is preceded immediately by a pyrimidine-rich sequence then an A-rich region 5′ of this (see Fig. 7 A). We first tested the involvement of these conserved upstream elements in priming at the ectopic site. Removal of the 7-nucleotide A-rich sequence in construct (+)ps3:p had no significant effect on priming compared with (+)ps3:o. However, deletion of the 5 5′ pyrimidines, conserved among REs, in construct (+)ps3:q, appeared to abolish priming (Fig. 3 B). Deletion of 6 nucleotides, mostly purines, immediately upstream of the G-box in construct (+)ps3:s, reduced the frequency of priming to about 13% of the level of the full-length ectopic sequence, while deletion of the G-block, construct (+)ps3:r, eliminated detectable priming. The seemingly essential nature of the pyrimidines was unexpected since there is evidence that they are not required for retrovirus plus-strand priming (12Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, deletion of the pyrimidines and the upstream purines, leaving the PPT intact (construct (+)ps3:u), allowed a level of priming approximately one-fifth that of the full-length primer. Further deletion of the 6 5′ nucleotides, predominantly purines, within the PPT in construct (+)ps3:v, also abolished priming. Substitution of 2 G-box G nucleotides for A nucleotides in construct (+)ps3:t, reduced priming efficiency to about 68%. A more significant reduction was seen in construct (+)ps3:w and, to a lesser extent in (+)ps3:x in which the PPT was shortened by 1 and 2 nucleotides, respectively (Fig. 2). These experiments show that maximal priming activity requires both a PPT sequence of optimal length together with upstream pyrimidines. Further mutants were constructed to investigate the effects of small deletions and insertions on primer efficiency and primer fidelity (described below). We confirmed involvement of the pyrimidines by removing 2 of the 5 T nucleotides in a construct lacking upstream purines that interfere with priming, (Fig. 4, construct (+)ps3:b) and observed a reduction in the level of priming efficiency to 75% that of the full-length element. In an attempt to increase priming efficiency, we added 3 extra T nucleotides (construct (+)ps3:a), but this produced priming with an efficiency indistinguishable from the wild-type sequence (Fig. 4). Removal of 3 of the 7 G nucleotides (construct (+)ps3:d) significantly reduced priming efficiency to 11%. A slight reduction in efficiency was also found with construct (+)ps3:c containing 2 extra G nucleotides (Fig. 3). These experiments define the limits of the cis-acting elements required for CaMV plus-strand priming in vivo. Thus, maximal priming activity requires 5 5′ pyrimidines and about 13 nucleotides in the PPT. Loss of more than 3 purines virtually abolishes priming, as does loss of all of the pyrimidines. Increasing the length of the PPT also reduced priming efficiency. The 5′ ends of the authentic CaMV plus-strands have been mapped previously to fixed positions (32Richards K. Guilley H. Jonard G. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as is the case with other REs. Therefore, we wanted to determine (i) whether priming fidelity was maintained at the ectopic site and (ii) the effects of mutations on priming precisionin vivo. We first checked the plus-strand 5′ end at the authentic (+)ps2 site in gene II, by primer extension. The 5′ end was found to be at a G residue 3 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ end of the PPT portion of the (+)ps2 site (Fig. 5 A). This is 1 nucleotide upstream of that previously reported by Richards et al.(32Richards K. Guilley H. Jonard G. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to the predominant 5′ end, lesser secondary ends were observed 1 or 2 nucleotides to the 5′ side of the major end. Interestingly, a gene II variant (d2) we have obtained following mutagenesis,2 with 2 of the PPT G nucleotides substituted for T nucleotides, showed essentially the same priming fidelity as the wild-type sequence (Fig. 5, A and D). We then determined priming fidelity at the (+)ps3 ectopic site and compared it with that at the authentic site. Priming by (+)ps3:o gave the same predominant 5′ end as was found at the wild-type (+)ps2 priming site (Fig. 5, compare B withA). In different primer extension experiments, the degree of heterogeneity around the major 5′ end sometimes varied. The distribution of ends shown in Fig. 5 D has been assessed from two or more primer extension experiments. None of the mutations studied altered the position of the major 5′ end relative to the 3′ end of the PPT. However, the relative abundance and positions of the secondary 5′ ends varied in some mutants. For instance, (+)ps3:t showed a slight bias of minor ends to the 5′ side and (+)ps3:x to the 3′ side of the major 5′ end (Fig. 5, B and D). Mutations affecting the 5′ pyrimidines had no significant effect on the major 5′ end. The most significant effect on plus-strand priming fidelity was observed in construct (+)ps3:c in which 2 additional G residues had been inserted into the PPT. This construct produced two major 5′ ends with the predominant end located 3 nucleotides from the PPT 3′ end, as before. However, the second major end was displaced 2 nucleotides to the 5′ side, which places this end at the same relative position from the 5′ end of the PPT as in the wild-type sequence (Fig. 5 D). These experiments show that DNA plus-strand 5′ end positioning by the ectopic priming element is essentially the same as at the authentic site. Additionally, the start site appears to be controlled by the length of the PPT portion of the (+)ps element with a primary fixing point at the PPT 3′ end. During assembly of one (+)ps3 construct into CaMV vector M10, we isolated a clone with three tandem (+)ps3:o elements, each in forward orientation (Fig. 6 A). This construct was infectious and relatively stable, although a recombinant with a single (+)ps3:o element was cloned from PCR reactions on progeny virion DNA. Primer extension of the (+)ps3:3o virions showed a correctly positioned DNA 5′ end at each of the three priming sites (Fig. 6 B). However, the discontinuities resulting from priming at the upstream elements would only be detectable by primer extension if priming at the respective downstream element(s) had not occurred (Fig. 6 C, i–iii). Priming at all three tandem sites in any one virion DNA molecule (Fig. 6 C, iv) would not be detectable by primer extension, so we cannot exclude more than one priming event per molecule. An additional 5′ end was mapped to a non-authentic purine-rich sequence in the most distal element (Fig. 6 B) that we had not seen in other primer extension experiments. This experiment indicates that the presence of adjacent primers does not affect primer fidelity, although there may have been some competition for selection and generation of additional ends due to the complexity of the sequence environment. The experiments above demonstrated the relative efficiency of variant (+)ps elements when they were redundant to viral replication. Although primer redundancy is a normal feature of CaMV, we wanted to be sure that priming at the ectopic site could be fully functional in replication. To achieve this, we resolved to destroy authentic CaMV plus-strand priming and to rescue infectivity with a single ectopic priming element. The CaMV (+)ps1 element is colinear with the RT gene; therefore, destruction of this primer must not disrupt RT. We introduced single nucleotide changes converting purines to pyrimidines and, vice versa, without changing the RT amino acid sequence, producing construct PB1, which was infectious (Fig. 7, A and B). Progeny PB1 virion DNA isolated from plants had only one discontinuity in each strand producing predominantly genome-length single-stranded DNA fragments (8 kb) on denaturation together with a predicted fragment of 6.4 kb arising from defective second strand transfer (Fig. 7,C and D). Next, the (+)ps2 element was disrupted with third nucleotide changes, in construct BB8. This was also infectious with characteristics suggesting priming from only one (+)ps site (Fig. 7, C and D). To test the effectiveness of both sets of mutations, we produced construct BB9, which should have been completely disabled in plus-strand priming. In the first infectivity test, we inoculated 15 turnip seedlings with BB9 DNA and none showed symptoms. In a second round of BB9 inoculations, 1 plant from 15 showed symptoms. Analysis of the virion DNA from this plant indicated that priming had occurred only at the mutated (+)ps2 site but that the mutated sequence had been retained. 3R. Noad, D. Turner, and S. Covey, unpublished observations. Because of the residual infectivity exhibited by BB9, we made two further constructs in which the (+)ps2 element was deleted. BB21 had a 33-bp in-frame deletion removing (+)ps2, which, together with the (+)ps1 mutations, completely abolished infectivity. We also constructed a hybrid CaMV, PM1, comprising the gene II region from CaMV isolate CM4–184 with its 421-bp deletion removing (+)ps2, the inactivated (+)ps1 element, and a linker in the 35 S promoter capable of receiving a new (+)ps element. PM1 was not infectious but infectivity was rescued by insertion of a (+)ps:o element (Table I) into the linker generating construct GG5 (Fig. 7). This clearly demonstrates that CaMV infectivity can be made dependent upon an artificial plus-strand primer in an ectopic genomic location and validates the functional assay of mutants at the redundant ectopic site. Priming of DNA plus-strand synthesis is a critical step in RE propagation. We report here the first detailed study of thecis-acting sequence requirements for this process during RE viral infection of a whole organism. This was facilitated by the ability to manipulate a redundant ectopic (+)ps element in infectious clones of the plant pararetrovirus CaMV. In particular, we were able to study priming, independent of any requirement in replication or pathogenicity. By measuring the percentage of virion DNA molecules containing a new discontinuity at the ectopic (+)ps3 location, we estimated the approximate efficiency of priming at this site as about 85–90%. We have previously shown that priming at the authentic CaMV plus-strand primers is less than 100% efficient, generating a proportion of progeny DNA molecules lacking a discontinuity at each of the two sites, respectively (23Turner D.S. Covey S.N. Virus Res. 1993; 28: 171-185Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, we would not expect priming at the new site to be more efficient than at the authentic primers so 85–90% probably approximates the efficiency of the authentic primers as well. The shortest artificial primer that gave maximal activity (construct p) was 19 nucleotides long. We conclude that the complete element probably encompasses 18 nucleotides assuming that the 5′-most A residue in this construct is not a part of the primer. Further mutational analysis should confirm this. Deleted variants of the artificial (+)ps3 element which reduced the size of the 13 nucleotide PPT to 10 or fewer purines significantly reduced the efficiency of priming. Priming was still detectable when only the 7 G-box residues of the 13 nucleotide PPT were retained, but deletion of the 7 G nucleotides leaving 5 purines abolished priming. Priming efficiency was also diminished when the length of the PPT was increased by 3 or more nucleotides. This suggests a simple relationship between PPT length and priming efficiency, but other factors must also be important because deletion of the first PPT purine caused a greater loss of priming efficiency than loss of the first 2 purines (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, deletion of the 5 pyrimidines (T nucleotides) located immediately 5′ of the PPT (construct q) abolished detectable priming (Fig. 3). Loss of the T nucleotides caused juxtaposition of an upstream stretch of A nucleotides next to the PPT increasing the PPT length from 13 to 20 nucleotides. This change was most likely inhibitory to priming, supporting our conclusion that the PPT has both a minimal and maximal length for optimum efficiency. However, other mutants showed a clear involvement of the 5′ pyrimidines in primer recognition. Although pyrimidine-rich sequences 5′ to the PPT are highly conserved among REs,in vitro experiments with retroviral PPTs have suggested that the 5′ pyrimidines are not necessary for priming (see ,e.g., Refs. 11Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 12Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The differences between CaMV and retroviruses could reflect a fundamental divergence in the priming mechanism. However, due to the conservation of the 5′ pyrimidines among REs, we favor the explanation that some priming reactions in vitro do not accurately reflect all of the priming steps in vivo, as discussed by Klarmann et al. (13Klarmann G.J., Yu, H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One explanation for this difference might reside in the design of primer/template combinations used in in vitro studies. For example, use of a continuous RNA primer annealed to a DNA template (12Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allows assay of only the polymerase-independent RNase H cleavages and excludes the initial round of polymerase-dependent RNase H cleavages generating RNA fragments during reverse transcription (6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, we could rationalize our observation that the upstream pyrimidines play an enhancing role in primer recognition by proposing that they function in vivo during the polymerase-dependent phase. From our observations, we can propose a hypothetical model for plus-strand priming in CaMV (Fig. 8). We suggest that, during synthesis of the DNA (−)strand, polymerase-dependent RNase H cleavages are directed toward the 5′ pyrimidines. It is possible that, at this stage, the PPT is completely separated from adjacent sequences (Fig. 8 A, iii), leading to enhanced recognition on the subsequent round of polymerase-independent RNase H cleavages. The PPT is then processed to leave a precise 3′ end from which the DNA plus-strand originates. The primer is recognized by RT, which extends the DNA plus-strand on the DNA minus-strand template. Completion of the plus-strand occurs after one circuit of the circular template, where it slightly displaces the DNA plus-strand 5′ end. Further progression by strand displacement is prevented by inefficient strand-displacing activity of the CaMV RT. The RNA primer on the DNA 5′ end “ages” leaving one or a few oligoribonucleotides (34Guilley H. Richards K.E. Jonard G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Aspects of this model could be tested by comparing in vivo functions with in vitro reactions using purified CaMV RT. Fidelity of priming at the artificial (+)ps3 site was the same as at the authentic (+)ps2 site, although this was 1 nucleotide different from that previously reported by Richards et al. (32Richards K. Guilley H. Jonard G. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since the 5′ pyrimidines had no apparent effect on priming accuracy, processing of the remnants of the pregenome template RNA to give the precise cleavage for priming must only involve interaction between the ribo-PPT and the active site of RNase H on a DNA template (Fig. 8 A, iv–vii). Our results are consistent with a model (Fig. 8 B) in which there is an apparent preference for interaction between the 3′ portion of the PPT and RNase H since various deletions of the PPT did not alter the position of the primary cleavage site 3 nucleotides upstream of the PPT 3′ end (Fig. 4 D). Increasing the length of the PPT by 2 nucleotides again produced the major priming site 3 nucleotides upstream from the PPT 3′ end, suggesting a primary measuring recognition between RNase H and the PPT 3′ end. However, the presence of a major secondary site 2 nucleotides upstream of this suggests alternative PPT length measurement from the PPT 5′ end (Fig. 8 B, ii and iii). This might also explain heterogeneity in priming. An alternative model for primer recognition would involve changes in shape of the RNase H active site to fit around primers of different lengths rather than variations in the way the PPT fits into a fixed-shape active site (Fig. 8 B, iv). It is likely that other structural features are important in defining the 5′ end, as suggested for HIV-1 by Powell and Levin (12Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various studies have shown that purine for pyrimidine substitutions in the PPT affect priming fidelity (11Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Heyman T. Agoutin B. Friant S. Wilhelm F.X. Wilhelm M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pullen K.A. Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6221-6227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This remains to be determined for CaMV (+)ps elements, but, in two of our primer mutants in which 2 adjacent PPT G residues were substituted by 2 A and 2 T nucleotides, respectively, no change in the predominant DNA 5′ end was observed. The presence of immediately adjacent, tandem (+)ps elements in one of our constructs also showed no effect of primer proximity on priming fidelity, although there appeared to be competition for primer selection and possibly a novel 5′ end generated in a purine-rich region in the last tandem primer. The precision of the plus-strand 5′ ends in pararetroviruses is intriguing since they do not integrate an LTR-containing provirus with precise boundaries like retroviruses and retrotransposons. This conserved precision suggests that the RT-associated enzyme activities responsible for generating plus-strand primers are inextricably linked to production of a precise start site rather than a frayed end, suggesting that pararetroviral RTs evolved from retroviral or retrotransposon RTs rather than the converse. We also confirmed that the artificial (+)ps element functioned accurately and efficiently independent of its sequence environment. It also seems to function equally well in at least three other randomly chosen insertion sites (data not shown). Full functionality was confirmed by use of the ectopic primer to rescue infectivity following mutational inactivation of the authentic (+)ps sites. Suppression or removal of the two authentic CaMV (+)ps elements resulted in complete abolition of viral infectivity, suggesting that any minor additional priming sites, previously reported by Maule and Thomas (24Maule A.J. Thomas C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7359-7373Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), were not sufficient to establish infectivity. These observations raise the question as to the requirement for redundant plus-strand primers in CaMV and other REs. It has been suggested that an additional (+)ps site increases the rate of replication of HIV-1, although it may also be involved in a novel replicative strategy (35Kupiec J.-J. Sonigo P. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that multiple (+)ps sites in plant pararetroviruses confer a replicative advantage. Pathogenically, CaMV variants with one (+)ps are only marginally less severe than those with two, although this difference could be due to an effect on colinear elements. One explanation for plus-strand primer redundancy in plant pararetroviruses might lie in their inherent inefficiency. Two or more primers could confer a slight adaptive advantage over a single primer in marginal environments. Even so, the ability to manipulate pararetroviral plus-strand priming mechanisms in vivo opens up new possibilities to understand the relationship between in vitro and in vivo studies of RT and to engineer new types of RT and RE tools.

Each polypeptide consists of two tandem globin folds followed by a highly charged COOH-terminal tail that contains four direct repeats of His-Lys-Glu-Glu (HKEE). Deletion analysis of the AH tail determined that at least two of the four HKEE repeats are required for efficient octamer formation. Surprisingly, the first four residues of the tail (Glu-His-His-Glu) alone were moderately effective in promoting multimerization. The hemoglobin from Pseudoterranova decipiens (PH) also consists of two globin domains followed by a shorter COOH-terminal extension containing only one HKEE repeat. Interchanging the tails of AH and PH revealed that the PH tail is moderately effective in promoting octamer formation. Dissociation analysis of wild-type and mutant AH and PH revealed that the intact octamers are stabilized by interactions between residues within the globin folds, not the tail. Mutational and biochemical studies revealed that one key interaction is contributed by isoleucine 15, which lies in the unusually long AB loop of AH. We propose that the AH tail plays no role in stabilization of the quaternary structure once formed but rather functions as an intramolecular chaperone, aiding assembly of the nascent AH octamer.

The perienteric hemoglobin of the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides has long fascinated scientists because of its exceptional oxygen avidity and unique quaternary structure (1Davenport H.E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1949; 136: 255-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Ascaris hemoglobin is a homooctamer comprised of identical 43-kDa polypeptides (2Okazaki T. Briehl R.W.

Excluding the tail, the two globin folds are highly homologous with 63% amino acid identity (4Sherman D.R. Kloek A.P. Krishnan B.R. Guinn B. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 22-amino acid COOH-terminal tail is highly charged (see Fig. 1) and contains four direct repeats of His-Lys-Glu-Glu (HKEE). Molecular modeling suggests that the tails may form an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel stabilized by interstrand salt bridges between side chains (5De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J.

It demonstrates remarkable conservation of the tertiary structure compared with globins of diverse species (8Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Numerous attempts by our laboratory and others to crystallize native or recombinant full-lengthAscaris hemoglobin have failed. Interestingly, another parasitic nematode, Pseudoterranova decipiens, contains a hemoglobin with marked similarity toAscaris hemoglobin. The hemoglobin of Pseudoterranova(PH)1 is extremely oxygen-avid, with kinetic properties similar to those of Ascaris hemoglobin (AH) (13Gibson Q.H. Regan R. Olson J.S. Carver T.E. Dixon B. Pohajdak B. Sharma P.K. Vinogradov S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16993-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptide of PH likewise contains two tandemly repeated globin folds (P1 and P2) followed by a COOH-terminal tail (see Fig. 1) (14Dixon B. Walker B. Kimmins W. Pohajdak B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5655-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of PH has not been reported in the literature, but the molecule is believed to be octameric. 2B. Pohajdak, personal communication. The globin folds of AH and PH share extensive homology (4Sherman D.R. Kloek A.P. Krishnan B.R. Guinn B. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The first domains (D1 and P1) are 73% identical, and the second domains (D2 and P2) are 58% identical. However, there is much less homology in their COOH-terminal tails. The tail of PH is 7 amino acids shorter than that of AH, contains only 1 HKEE repeat, and is substantially diminished in the number of consecutive side chains with alternating charges predicted by a β-strand conformation (see Fig. 1). The importance of the PH tail in subunit assembly is unknown. Using molecular and biochemical approaches, we previously initiated studies to delineate the role of the tail in Ascarishemoglobin octamer formation (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The addition of the tail to monomeric D1 or myoglobin did not result in multimer formation. Furthermore, removal of the tail from full-length Ascarishemoglobin substantially decreased but did not eliminate the ability to multimerize. These data revealed that the tail is necessary, but not sufficient, for Ascaris hemoglobin octamer formation. In this study, we have defined the contribution of the tail to AH octamer assembly and stability and have identified an additional region of AH important in subunit interactions. cDNA encoding the hemoglobin gene of PH was obtained as two partial EcoRI fragments (a gift from Dr. Bill Pohajdak, Dalhousie University). A two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy was used to assemble a full-length PH cDNA (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 16Morrison H.G. Desrosiers R.C. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). In Reaction I of the first PCR step, amplification of the 5′ EcoRI fragment (18.3) was performed with a forward primer (5′-agcgccatggcgtcaaaaacgcgagagctatgc-3′) complementary to the extreme 5′ end of the coding sequence of PH that also provided anNcoI restriction site along with an additional alanine at the amino terminus. The reverse primer (5′-gtggctgatttcatgtgagaattctttaccgatctcttgcca-3′) contained 21 nucleotides complementary to the extreme 3′ end of the coding region of 18.3 plus 21 nucleotides complimentary to the extreme 5′-coding region of the 3′ EcoRI fragment (10.2). In Reaction II, amplification of the 3′ fragment (10.2) was conducted with a forward primer complementary to the reverse primer used in Reaction I. The reverse primer in Reaction II (5′-gcatccatggtcagtggtgttcctctttgtgc-3′) was complementary to the extreme 3′ end of the coding sequence of PH and also provided a stop codon and an NcoI restriction site. The overlapping products of Reactions I and II were diluted 10-fold and amplified in an additional PCR step with the extreme 5′ and 3′ end-specific oligonucleotides, generating a full-length cDNA encoding PH. PCR was performed in a Robocycler Gradient 40 (Stratagene). Final reaction components were as described (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Reactions were cycled 30 times at 95 °C for 1 min 30 s, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 45 s. Two μl of PCR product were ligated into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen), then transformed into Escherichia coli strain Top 10F. Positive clones were selected on LB ampicillin plates and screened by PCR analysis. Plasmid DNA-encoding PH was purified using a Nucleobond AX-100 kit (Macherey-Nagel) and digested with NcoI at 37 °C overnight. Fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel. The fragment corresponding to PH cDNA was excised, purified by adsorption to a glass slurry using the Elu-Quik DNA purification kit (Schleicher & Schuell), then cloned into NcoI-digested, phosphatase-treated Studier expression vector pET-8C as described (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Positives were verified by cycle sequencing in a TC480 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) using an ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). Positive clones were then transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Creation of full-lengthAscaris hemoglobin with the Pseudoterranovahemoglobin tail (AHPt) required two cloning steps. Both PCR reactions used a forward primer corresponding to the extreme 5′-coding region of AH, described previously (6Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All reverse primers contained a stop codon and an NcoI restriction site. In the first step, full-length AH cDNA was amplified with the reverse primer (5′-ccatggtcatccttcatgatggtctttttcggctttgccgtgccttgtggcctcatacgcaaattcc-3′) containing 34 nucleotides complementary to the 3′ end of AH just upstream of the tail and 24 nucleotides complementary to the first 8 amino acids of the PH tail (see Fig. 1). The resultant mutant AH, containing the first 8 amino acids of the PH tail, was then used as a template in the second cloning step with a different reverse primer (5′-ccatggtcagtggtgttcctctttgtgctctccttcatgatggtctttttcggctttgccg-3′) containing 31 nucleotides complementary to the extreme 3′ end of the mutant intermediate AH and 21 nucleotides complementary to the remaining 7 amino acids of the PH tail, resulting in AHPt. Construction of full-length Pseudoterranova hemoglobin with the Ascaris hemoglobin tail (PHAt) utilized a similar strategy described for AHPt, except three cloning steps were required because of the increased length of the AH tail. All PCR reactions used a forward primer corresponding to the extreme 5′-coding region of PH as described for Pseudoterranova hemoglobin construct. All reverse primers contained a stop codon and an NcoI restriction site. In the first step, PH cDNA was used as template with a reverse primer (5′-ccatggtcactcttctttatgctcgtggtgttcctttgcatgcttatcggcctcatgcgcgaagtcc-3′) containing 34 nucleotides complementary to the 3′ end of PH just upstream of the tail and 24 nucleotides complementary to the first 8 amino acids of the AH tail (see Fig. 1). The resultant mutant PH cDNA was then used as a template in the second step with a reverse primer (5′-ccatggtcactcctctttatgctcttctttatgctcttctttatgctcgtggtgttcctttgcatgc-3′) containing 34 nucleotides complementary to the extreme 3′ end of the mutant intermediate PH and 24 nucleotides complementary to an additional 8 amino acids of the AH tail. This mutant PH cDNA encoding 16 of the 22 amino acids of the AH tail was used as template in the last step with a reverse primer (5′-ccatggtcagtgttgctcttccttatgctcctctttatgctcttctttatgctcttcttt-3′) containing 33 nucleotides complementary to the 3′ end of the second mutant intermediate PH and 18 nucleotides complementary to the last 6 amino acids of the AH tail, resulting in PHAt. In constructing the AH tail deletion mutants (see Fig. 1), all PCR reactions used the AH expression plasmid as the template with the same forward primer for AH as above. All reverse primers contained a stop codon and an NcoI restriction site. The reverse primers used were 5′-ccatggtcactcctctttatgctcttctttatgctcttctttatgctcg-3′ (AH-t.1), 5′-ccatggtcactcttctttatgctcttctttatgctcgtggtgttctttgccg-3′ (AH-t.2), 5′-ccatggtcactcttctttatgctcgtggtgttctttgccg-3′ (AH-t.3), and 5′-ccatggtcactcgtggtgttctttgccgtgccttgtggcc-3′ (AH-t.4). Creation of Ascaris hemoglobin without a tail (AH-t) was described previously (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For the position 15 mutants, a two-step PCR strategy was utilized as above. In making domain one plus the tail with residue 15 mutated from valine to isoleucine (D1+t V15I), Reaction I contained the expression construct of D1+ t (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) as the template with the same forward primer for AH as above along with the reverse primer (5′-actagtgtcgatcttcgcatg-3′). Reaction II contained the same template with a forward primer complementary to the reverse primer used in Reaction I plus the reverse primer to D1+t, described previously (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Both products were diluted, then used as the template in an additional PCR step with the extreme 5′ and 3′ primers to assemble the final product. Domain two with residue 15 mutated from isoleucine to valine (D2 I15V) was created essentially as for D1+t V15I, except using the corresponding primers for the extreme 5′ and 3′ of D2 as described previously (6Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the primer encoding the mutation (5′-actatgcccaacgtcgatatg-3′) and its complement. For all mutant hemoglobins, PCR conditions, cloning into pET-8C, and subsequent analyses were performed as described under “Pseudoterranova Hemoglobin Construct.” Expression and purification of hemoglobins was as described previously (6Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) with a few exceptions. Sonication was performed in a total volume of 30 ml, and aside from the position 15 mutants, was performed in the presence of 1% v/v Triton X-100. All hemoglobins were purified using Fast Flow DEAE (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by step-wise elution with increasing concentrations of NaCl in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Hemoglobins were analyzed using a Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Except where stated, 50 μl of hemoglobin at 4.1 mg/ml were injected onto the column. Samples with 5 to 10-fold concentrated and 10-fold diluted hemoglobins were tested. For the position 15 mutants, slowing of the elution rate by 10-fold to 0.05 ml/min was also performed as an additional control. Variation of the concentration of hemoglobin or the flow rate of the column had no effect on elution profiles. In additional control experiments, fractions corresponding to octamer and aggregate species were isolated. Repeat gel filtration of separated octamer and aggregate revealed that these species are stable and are not in equilibrium. Data were collected and analyzed using Dynamax high performance liquid chromatography Method Manager (Rainin). Approximately 35 μg of DEAE-purified hemoglobin were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of a final concentration of 2 m NaSCN in a total volume of 18 μl. Controls using 10-fold concentrated hemoglobin in the same volume were performed. In controls for 10-fold dilution, incubations were performed as described above, then the reaction was diluted 10-fold with 2 m NaSCN in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, just before injection onto a Superose 12 column. Variation of the concentration of hemoglobin had no effect on elution profiles. In these experiments, successive truncations of the four HKEE repeats of the AH tail were created (Fig. 1). Mutant hemoglobins purified fromE. coli extracts migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as predicted (data not shown). To assess quaternary structure, identical amounts of purified truncated hemoglobins were injected onto a Superose 12 gel filtration column. Elution profiles are shown in Fig. 2. The initial narrow elution peak (∼15 min) seen in all panels represents aggregated protein eluting in the void volume. Truncation of one or two HKEE repeats, forming AH-t.1 and AH-t.2 respectively, resulted in hemoglobins with elution profiles indistinguishable from that of AH. However, when three or all four of the HKEE repeats were removed (AH-t.3 and AH-t.4, respectively), the quaternary structures were substantially altered. Several intermediate peaks were visible, including a peak at the position expected for monomer (∼43 kDa). Complete removal of the tail (AH-t) caused an even more profound disruption of octamer formation. Intermediate oligomers were detected as for AH-t.3 and AH-t.4. Furthermore, very little properly folded and assembled AH-t was formed compared with other truncated globins, with the majority of AH-t forming aggregates. To determine the assembly state of the two-domain hemoglobin from PH, we initially pieced together a full-length cDNA from two partial cDNAs. After DEAE purification, gel filtration analysis of recombinant PH (Fig. 3) showed an elution profile similar to that of AH, with a peak at the position expected for octamer (∼20 min), confirming unpublished reports. We also cloned and expressed the separated globin domains, P1 and P2. In solution, P1 was monomeric, and P2 was multimeric (data not shown). These experiments were performed to determine whether the tails of PH and AH could promote efficient octamer formation of the other hemoglobin. The tails of AH and PH were interchanged, creating AH with the PH tail (AHPt) and PH with the AH tail (PHAt). Gel filtration analysis was performed to determine the quaternary structure of AHPt and PHAt. Both AHPt and PHAt eluted at positions expected for octamer (Fig. 3, ∼20 min), demonstrating that the tails are functional on either hemoglobin. To assess the contribution of the different tails to octamer stability, wild-type and mutant hemoglobins were disrupted with NaSCN. In these experiments, DEAE-purified recombinant hemoglobins were incubated in the presence of 2 m NaSCN for 5 min. The quaternary structure of disrupted hemoglobins was assayed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4). The dissociation of both AH and AHPt resulted in the production of several intermediates; peaks corresponded to the expected migration of tetramer and dimer with little monomer. Disruption of AH-t resulted in similar disruption of the octamer. The elution profiles for both PH and PHAt drastically differed from those of AH and AHPt. PH and PHAt octamers nearly completely dissociated after treatment with NaSCN, resulting in a predominant peak at the elution time expected for monomer (∼43 kDa), with small amounts of higher oligomers present. In these studies, the residue at position 15 was interchanged between domain 1 plus the tail (D1+t) and domain 2 (D2) of AH. Using a two-step PCR mutagenesis strategy, isoleucine was substituted for valine in D1+t, resulting in D1+t V15I, and valine was substituted for isoleucine in D2 (containing the tail), creating D2 I15V. Gel filtration analysis of purified, recombinant globins is shown in Fig. 5. D1+t V15I eluted at the position expected for a monomer, just ahead of myoglobin (17.5 kDa), demonstrating no change compared with monomeric D1+t (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The minor lower molecular weight peak corresponds to a stable degradation product visible by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (data not shown). D2 and D2 I15V were expressed and purified in parallel. Identical amounts at equal concentrations of the two proteins were injected onto a gel filtration column to assess quaternary structure. The elution profile for D2 demonstrated peaks corresponding the migration of predominantly tetramer and dimer, with some monomer and octamer present. D2 I15V, however, eluted predominantly at the position expected for monomer, with little dimer and other higher multimers present. Previously, our laboratory reported that the primary determinants of AH octamer formation lie within the second globin domain (6Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we targeted the tail as a potential multimerization motif and found that the tail was necessary but not sufficient for octamer formation (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dissociation studies demonstrated that multiple types of interactions stabilize the AH octamer (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The goals of this study were to further define the role of the tail in AH assembly and stability and to identify additional regions of the molecule contributing to octamer stability. Initially, we determined the minimal sequence of the AH tail required for octamer formation. A series of AH mutants with successive deletions of HKEE repeats was constructed. Removal of up to two of the four HKEE repeats had no effect on oligomerization. However, deletion of three or all four HKEE repeats, or the entire tail, substantially altered subunit assembly. Lower order oligomers, including a significant amount of monomer, were apparent for AH-t.3 and AH-t.4. Surprisingly, further deletion of the first four residues of the tail (EHHE), creating AH-t, had a dramatic effect on octamer assembly. In addition to the presence of smaller multimers, the majority of the protein was aggregated, compared with other AH globins. These experiments demonstrated that 12 amino acids containing two HKEE repeats are required for efficient octamer formation. However, a very short, four-amino acid COOH-terminal extension (EHHE) can partially support AH octamer formation. P. decipiens contains a hemoglobin with striking similarity to AH (4Sherman D.R.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5655-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The polypeptide of PH is also comprised of two tandem globin repeats followed by a COOH-terminal extension. However, the tail of PH is 7 amino acids shorter with only one HKEE repeat. Similar to AH, recombinant PH forms an octamer, P1 forms a monomer, and P2 is multimeric (data not shown). We hypothesized that the PH tail may function in promoting efficient octamer formation, as does the AH tail. To test this hypothesis, we interchanged the tails between AH and PH, creating AHPt and PHAt. Not surprisingly, both mutant hemoglobins with heterologous tails retained the ability to form an octamer. However, the PH tail was less effective in promoting octamer formation than the AH tail. Both AH and PHAt had more octamer compared with aggregate than their counterparts with the PH tail, AHPt and PH, respectively (Fig. 3). The reduced length of the PH tail is likely not the cause of this reduced efficiency, as the PH tail is 3 amino acids longer than the completely functional 12 amino-acid tail of AH-t.2. This suggests that the increased number of HKEE repeats and perhaps the number of consecutive alternating charges in a predicted β-strand conformation (5De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J.

DeBaere I. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 249-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) enhance the ability of the AH tail to promote octamer formation. Previous work demonstrated that several types of interactions exist between subunits within the intact octamer (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 17Darawshe S. Daniel E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the tail participated in one of these types of interactions, stabilizing the octamer. To test this, we dissociated wild-type and mutant globins with NaSCN, previously demonstrated by our laboratory to selectively disrupt AH into intermediate tetramer, dimer, and monomer intermediates (15Minning D.M. Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22248-22253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence of either tail had no effect on the pattern of intermediates seen. AH and AHPt had similar dissociation patterns, with the expected appearance of tetramer and dimer intermediates with little monomer present. AH-t also displayed a similar profile, albeit with peaks of much lower magnitude because of the decreased amount of octamer in the starting material. Much stronger interactions occur between AH subunits than between those of PH; both PH and PHAt rapidly dissociated into monomer. Because changing or deleting the tail had no effect on the pattern of dissociation intermediates detected, we conclude that the major interactions stabilizing the intact octamer occur between residues within the globin folds. However, the AH tail is absolutely essential for efficientde novo octamer formation. Deletion of the AH tail had a drastic effect, resulting in deficient octamer assembly. Furthermore, deletion of more than two HKEE repeats or replacement with the PH tail had a partial effect on proper folding and assembly. Based on these data, we propose that the tail of AH may function as an endochaperone, aiding the de novo assembly of the AH octamer. Endo- or intramolecular chaperones are regions of proproteins required for proper folding. They were first reported for subtilisin, which was found to fold into an inactive conformation in the absence of its propeptide (18Ikemura H. Takagi H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7859-7864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Examples of other well characterized proteins containing intramolecular chaperones required for folding include α-lytic protease (20Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), aqualysin (21Lee Y.C. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 92: 73-78Crossref Google Scholar), and carboxypeptidase Y (22Winther J.R. Sorensen P. Kielland-Brandt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22007-22013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, certain oligomeric proteins contain endochaperones required for assembly, such as von Willebrand factor (23Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), activin A (24Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor β-1 (24Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), yeast 20 S proteasome (25Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and collagen (for review see Ref. 26McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, the endochaperone is found within propeptide regions and is then cleaved from the mature protein after aiding folding or assembly of the covalently attached polypeptide. The tail of Ascarishemoglobin represents a novel example of a potential intramolecular chaperone. The tail is not found within the propeptide region of the molecule, and more importantly, is not cleaved from the properly folded and assembled octamer. The unique primary sequence of theAscaris tail seems to be critical for maximal function. Perturbations of the tail, either by deletion or by replacement with the related tail of PH, altered its ability to promote octamer formation. It is likely that the PH tail functions as an endochaperone, albeit with reduced efficiency. Our next goal was to determine regions within the globin fold that contribute to octamer stability. Although D1 is monomeric in solution, it formed a weak, symmetric dimer within the crystalline lattice (6Kloek A.P. Yang J. Mathews F.S. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17669-17671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Previously, we determined that the interface of the D1 crystalline dimer is formed by the E- and F- helices, along with the AB loop. To determine whether any of these residues contribute to stabilizing the intact octamer, we made an array of mutations along the proposed interface, interchanging residues between D1 and D2. The goal of these experiments was to either promote multimerization of monomeric D1 and D1+t or to disrupt D2 multimer formation. Most of the mutations disrupted recombinant protein expression. However, alteration of amino acid 15 was revealing. The residue at position 15 is a valine in D1 and an isoleucine in D2 (residue 165 in the full-length polypeptide). Changing the valine to isoleucine in D1+t had no effect on multimer formation, as the mutant molecule remained monomeric. However, when the residue at position 15 was decreased by only one carbon unit from isoleucine to valine, D2 I15V was deficient in multimerization, forming mostly monomer, compared with D2, which formed mostly tetramer and dimer with little monomer. These experiments demonstrate that isoleucine 15 in D2 contributes a key interaction stabilizing the multimer. Isoleucine 15 lies in the unusually long AB loop of AH (4Sherman D.R. Kloek A.P. Krishnan B.R. Guinn B. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,5De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J. Gielens C. Richelle J. Trotman C. Finch J. Gerstein M. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4638-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on our analysis of the D1 crystalline dimer, valine 15 of D1 interacted with alanine 86, which is a much bulkier hydrophobic methionine in D2. Residues within the AB loop of AH were initially hypothesized to contribute to the high oxygen avidity (5De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J. Gielens C. Richelle J. Trotman C. Finch J. Gerstein M. Perutz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4638-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, a role for the AB loop in this capacity has yet to be demonstrated. We conclude that the AB loop, specifically isoleucine 15 in the second globin domain, contributes to stabilizing the unique quaternary structure of AH. These studies have analyzed the contribution of the Ascarishemoglobin tail to octamer assembly and stability, using deletion analysis, as well as comparison of AH with PH. We determined that the AH tail is essential for efficient octamer formation, despite the fact that it does not stabilize the intact octamer. Based on our data, we propose that the tail of Ascaris hemoglobin may serve as a novel intramolecular chaperone, which is not cleaved from the mature octamer. Future biophysicochemical studies will elucidate the precise role of the Ascaris hemoglobin tail in folding and assembly of the octamer.
