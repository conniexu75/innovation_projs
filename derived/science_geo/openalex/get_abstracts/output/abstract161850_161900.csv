https://openalex.org/W2106450793,"Thioredoxin plays an important role in various cellular processes through redox regulation. Here, we have demonstrated that thioredoxin expression is transcriptionally induced in K562 cells by hemin (ferriprotoporphyrin IX) through activation of a regulatory region positioned from −452 to −420 bp of the thioredoxin gene. Insertion of a mutation in the antioxidant responsive element (ARE)/AP-1 consensus binding sequence in this region abolished the response to hemin. With electrophoretic mobility shift and DNA affinity assays, we have shown that the NF-E2p45/small Maf complex constitutively binds to the ARE. The binding of the Nrf2/small Maf complex to ARE was induced by hemin, whereas the binding of Jun/Fos proteins to ARE was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not hemin. Hemin induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 but did not affect nuclear expression of Jun/Fos proteins. Overexpression of Nrf2 augmented the response to hemin in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of Nrf2 suppressed hemin-induced activation through the ARE. We show here hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene by Nrf2 through the ARE and propose a novel mechanism of the regulation of the ARE through a switch of its binding factors.

The two cysteine residues of thioredoxin undergo reversible oxidation-reduction reactions catalyzed by an NADPH-dependent enzyme, thioredoxin reductase. The thioredoxin and glutathione systems constitute the major cellular reducing systems (1Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Human thioredoxin was cloned as an adult T cell leukemia-derived factor (2Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J.

Thioredoxin also modulates the activity of various transcription factors, including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), hypoxia inducing factor 1 (HIF-1), and p53 (5Packer L.

Thioredoxin expression is induced in vivo in ischemia followed by reperfusion (12Ohira A. Honda O. Gauntt C.D. Yamamoto M. Hori K. Masutani H. Yodoi J. Honda Y. Lab.

Ueda S. Yodoi J. Sen C.K. Sies H. Baeuerle P.A. Antioxidant and Redox Regulation of Genes. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 297-311Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the regulation of thioredoxin gene expression by oxidative stress. Previous studies of the isolation and characterization of the human and mouse thioredoxin gene (14Taniguchi Y. Taniguchi U.Y. Mori K. Yodoi J.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 140: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that there are conserved SP-1 binding motifs in the gene regulatory region of the thioredoxin gene. In an erythroleukemic cell line K562, thioredoxin was reported to be induced transcriptionally by ferriprotoporphyrin IX (hemin)1 (18Leppa S. Pirkkala L. Chow S.C. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30400-30404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although heat shock factor (HSF)-2 was indicated to be responsible for this activation, the responsive element to hemin in the thioredoxin promoter has not yet been determined. There is accumulating evidence that heme (or more accurately, hemin, which is the oxidized form) itself acts as an intracellular regulator of a wide variety of metabolic pathways (19Padmanaban G. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 492-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of transmission of the signals induced by hemin appear heterogeneous and remain to be elucidated. A report showed that the heme responsive element of the mouse heme oxygenase-1 gene is an extended AP-1 binding site, which resembles the recognition sequences for MAF and NF-E2 transcription factors (20Inamdar N.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although the liberation of Nrf2 from Keap1 and subsequent nuclear translocation of Nrf2 is reported to be an important mechanism of activation through the ARE (30Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar), the regulation of factor binding and activation of ARE remains to be elucidated. These previous studies prompted us to investigate the mechanism of the regulation of thioredoxin gene expression by hemin. We report here that hemin activates the thioredoxin gene through the ARE. We also showed that the thioredoxin gene is regulated through the ARE by the binding of NF-E2p45/small Maf under unstimulated conditions, that of Nrf2/small Maf with hemin stimulation, and that of the Jun/Fos proteins with PMA stimulation. The binding of these factors to the ARE correlated well with their nuclear expression pattern. We also present evidence that Nrf2 plays a role in the hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene. We here propose a novel mechanism of the regulation of the ARE by a switch of binding factors including CNC-bZIP/small Maf transcription factors and the Jun/Fos proteins, depending on different stimuli. Hemin and PMA were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Hemin stocks were prepared as reported previously (31Theodorakis N.G. Zand D.J. Kotzbauer P.T. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PMA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO was kept to 0.1%. K562 (erythroleukemic cell line) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The pTrxCAT plasmids were constructed as described previously (14Taniguchi Y. Taniguchi U.Y. Mori K. Yodoi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2746-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The HindIII-BamHI inserts from the pTrxCAT vectors were subcloned into pBluescriptII KS (+) (pTRXblue vectors). The pTRX(−1148)-Luc, the pTRX(−980)-Luc, the pTRX(−874)-Luc, the pTRX(−463)-Luc, and the pTRX(−352)-Luc vectors were constructed by ligating the KpnI-BamHI fragments of the pTRXblue vectors to theKpnI-BglII sites of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega, WI). The pTRX(−463)-Luc vector was excised byHindIII, filled in, and then excised by XhoI. The insert was ligated to the SmaI/XhoI site of the pGL3 promoter vector to produce the pTRX(−463, −352)-Luc vector. TheBstEII-XhoI or NheI-BstEII insert of the pTRX (−463, −352)-Luc vector was excised, filled in, and self-ligated to produce the pTRX (−463, −447)-Luc or the pTRX (−452, −352)-Luc vector, respectively. The pTRX(−468, −435)-Luc, the pTRX (−452, −420)-WT-Luc, the pTRX(−452, −420)-M-Luc, the pTrxAREWT-Luc, the pTrxAREM1-Luc, the pTrxAREM2-Luc, the pTrxAREM3-Luc, and the pTrxAREM4-Luc vectors were constructed by inserting oligonucleotides OLIGO1, AREwt, AREm, AREW, AREM1, AREM2, AREM3, and AREM4 into the KpnI-NheI site of the pGL3 promoter vectors, respectively. All constructs were controlled by direct nucleotide sequencing using a Thermo Sequenase II dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pRL-CMV, the pRL-SV40, and the pRL-TK vectors were purchased from Promega. The oligonucleotides used for construction of vectors and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were as follows: OLIGO1: FW, 5′-cGAGATACTTCCCGGTCACCGTTACTCAGCACTg-3′ and Rev, 5′-ctagcAGTGCTGAGTAACGGTGACCGGGAAGTATCTCggtac-3′; AREwt: FW, 5′-cGGTCACCGTTACTCAGCACTTTGTGGGGTTCACg-3′ and Rev, 5′-ctagcGTGAACCCCACAAAGTGCTGAGTAACGGTGACCggtac-3′; AREm: FW, 5′-cGGTCACCGTTACCTTGCACTTTGTGGGGTTCACg-3′ and Rev, 5′-ctagcGTGAACCCCACAAAGTGCAAGGTAACGGTGACCggtac-3′; AREW: FW, 5′-cGGTCACCGTTACTCAGCACTTTG-3′ and Rev, 5′-ctagCAAAGTGCTGAGTAACGGTGACCggtac-3′; AREM1: FW, 5′-cGGCTTCCGTTACTCAGCACTTTG-3′ and Rev, 5′-ctagCAAAGTGCTGAGTAACGGAAGCCggtac-3′; AREM2: FW, 5′-cGGTCACCACCACTCAGCACTTTG-3′ and Rev, 5′-ctagCAAAGTGCTGAGTGGTGGTGACCggtac-3′; AREM3: FW, 5′-cGGTCACCGTTACCTTGCACTTTG-3′ and Rev, 5′-ctagCAAAGTGCAAGGTAACGGTGACCggtac-3′; AREM4: FW, 5′-cGGTCACCACCACCTTGCACTTTG-3′ and Rev, 5′-ctagCAAAGTGCAAGGTGGTGGTGACCggtac-3′; HSE: FW, 5′-CTAGAAGCTTCTAGAAGCTTCTAG-3′ and Rev, 5′-CTAGAAGCTTCTAGAAGCTTCTAG-3′. pEFNrf2, pEFMafK, pEFBOS have been previously described (32Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutant of Nrf2 (Nrf2-M) was generated by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (33Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The amplification product was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to produce pcDNA3-Nrf2-M. K562 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter expression vectors using DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After a 4-h incubation, various doses of hemin or control were added. For controlling the efficiency of transfection, Renillaluciferase gene expression was monitored using pRL-TK, pRL-SV40, or pRL-CMV (Promega). Luciferase gene expression, normalized byRenilla luciferase activity was analyzed 24 h later using an assay kit (Promega). Assays were performed in duplicate. Magnetic cell separation of transiently transfected cells was performed according to the instruction of manufacturer (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Anti-thioredoxin monoclonal antibody was provided by Fuji-Rebio (TRX11Ab). Anti-NF-E2p45 and anti-Nrf2 rabbit polyclonal antibody are specific for NF-E2p45 and Nrf2, respectively. Anti-c-Jun polyclonal antibody recognizes c-Jun, JunB, and JunD (data not shown). Anti-c-Fos polyclonal antibody (K-25) recognizes c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 (data not shown). These antibodies, anti-heat shock factor (HSF)-1, and anti-HSF-2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-MafK antibodies have been described previously (34Igarashi K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7445-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (6Ueno M. Masutani H. Arai R.J. Yamauchi A. Hirota K. Sakai T. Inamoto T. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. Sakai T. Nikaido T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35809-35815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared in the sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm DTT). Immunofluorescent study was performed as described previously (6Ueno M. Masutani H. Arai R.J. Yamauchi A. Hirota K. Sakai T. Inamoto T. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. Sakai T. Nikaido T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35809-35815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human thioredoxin was prepared and used for the immunofluorescent study. EMSA was performed as described previously (35Masutani H. Magnaghi Jaulin L. Ali S.A. Groisman R. Robin P. Harel Bellan A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing K562 cells incubated with various amounts of hemin, PMA, or control. Aliquots of 10 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides in a binding reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.02 mm EDTA, 14% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1.2 mm DTT for 20 min at 25 °C. For specificity analyses, 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors were added and were preincubated for 15 min. When indicated, reaction mixtures were incubated with antibodies for 20 min on ice before labeled oligonucleotides were added. Affinity purification assay using biotinylated oligonucleotides conjugated to magnetic beads was performed as described with modification (36Savoysky E. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Watanabe H. Sawada J. Nomura H. Ohsugi Y. Handa H. Sakai T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1839-1846PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′-biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides (AREW and AREM4) were immobilized to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (DynabeadsTM M-280 streptavidin, Dynal) as per manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of 200 μg of nuclear extract (200 μl) were incubated with the beads in a reaction buffer (final concentration: 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100) for 30 min at 25 °C. The beads were washed three times with 100 mm KCl buffer C (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT, 0.01% Triton X-100). The beads were eluted with 50 μl of 400 mm KCl buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100). Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (6Ueno M. Masutani H. Arai R.J. Yamauchi A. Hirota K. Sakai T. Inamoto T. Yamaoka Y. Yodoi J. Sakai T. Nikaido T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35809-35815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of activation by hemin, we first tested the response of the thioredoxin gene regulatory region to hemin treatment by a luciferase reporter assay. An activation of the thioredoxin gene was observed in a luciferase reporter construct containing whole thioredoxin promoter (pTRX(−1148)-Luc). To analyze the region responsible for the response to hemin, we used luciferase reporter genes containing a series of deletions of the thioredoxin promoter region. As shown in Fig.1 A, 3.6, 5.5, 2.9, or 3.5-fold induction of relative luciferase activity was observed using reporter genes (pTRX(−1148)-Luc, pTRX(−980)-Luc, pTRX(−874)-Luc, or pTRX(−463)-Luc) in response to hemin, respectively. The response was dose-dependent (data not shown). In contrast, no significant induction was observed using a reporter gene (pTRX(−352)-Luc), suggesting that −463 to −352 of the thioredoxin upstream sequence is important for the hemin response (Fig.1 A). To further determine the region required for hemin responsiveness, we used reporter vectors containing various lengths of nucleotides derived from −463 to −352 of the thioredoxin upstream sequence. Hemin activated both pTRX(−463, −352)-Luc and pTRX(−452, −352)-Luc vectors. In addition, hemin activated pTRX (−468, −435)-Luc, but not pTRX (−463, −447)-Luc. These findings showed that the −452 to −435 region is important for hemin response. Indeed, experiments using pTRX (−452, −420)-Luc showed a 25-fold response to hemin treatment, revealing that the −452 to −420 sequence is necessary for the hemin response (Fig. 1 B). In the hemin responsive region, the typical consensus sequence for binding of HSFs is not included. However, the region contains a sequence TGCTGAGTAAC, which resembles the optimal recognition sequence, TGCTGA(C/G)TCAGCA (21Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (T/C)GCTGA(G/C)TCA(C/T) (22Andrews N.C. Erdjument Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) of v-Maf and NF-E2p45, respectively. The sequence is also similar to the ARE, (A/G)GTGACNNNGC (23Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the AP-1 consensus binding sequence, TGA(C/G)TCA. We therefore tested the involvement of the sequence in hemin responsiveness. Activation of the thioredoxin gene by hemin was markedly reduced in a vector (pTRX(−452, −420)-M-Luc), which has a mutation in the region (Fig.2 A). As the effect of the mutation was partial, we further analyzed the hemin response, using constructs with various mutations in the hemin responsive region. A 10-fold activation was observed with a reporter vector containing wild-type ARE (pTrxAREWT-Luc) in response to hemin. The response was reduced in the pTrxAREM1-Luc, pTrxAREM2-Luc, or pTrxAREM3-Luc vector and was almost abolished in the pTrxAREM4-Luc vector (Fig.2 B). Collectively, these results showed the involvement of the ARE sequence overlapping with the AP-1 site in the response to hemin. In addition, the deletion of the ARE resulted in decrease of the basal activity of the thioredoxin promoter, showing that the ARE also contribute to the basal activity of the thioredoxin gene (data not shown). We next analyzed ARE-binding proteins by the EMSA. A constitutively bound complex (complex I), hemin-induced complex (complex II), and PMA-induced complex (complex III) to the ARE were detected in nuclear extracts of K562 cells. The binding of these complexes appeared to be specific because the binding of complex I, II, and III was abrogated by the addition of an excess amount of the wild-type oligonucleotides (Fig.3) but not by the M4 mutant of the ARE (data not shown). Faster migrating complexes seemed nonspecific because they were not competed by wild-type oligonucleotides. Complex I and II binding showed no competition by an excess of oligonucleotides encompassing the heat shock element (HSE), and no supershift was induced by either anti-HSF-1 antibody or anti-HSF-2 antibody. In contrast, hemin-induced specific binding to the HSE was abolished by an excess amount of oligonucleotide encoding the HSE and was supershifted by these antibodies (Fig. 3 A). We next tested whether the complexes include proteins known to bind to the ARE or the AP-1 site. Complex I was supershifted by the addition of anti-NF-E2p45 or anti-MafK antibodies, but not by antibodies against Nrf2 (Fig.3 B), Jun, Fos (Fig. 3 D), Nrf1, or v-Maf (data not shown), suggesting that complex I includes NF-E2p45 and small Maf proteins. Binding of complex II increased after treatment with hemin (Fig. 3, A and C). The hemin-induced complex (complex II) was completely abrogated or supershifted by the addition of anti-Nrf2 or anti-MafK antibodies but not by antibodies against NF-E2p45, Jun, Fos (Fig. 3 C), Nrf1, or v-Maf (data not shown), suggesting that complex II includes Nrf2 and small Maf proteins. We also observed a PMA-induced binding complex to the ARE. The PMA-induced complex (complex III) was abrogated or supershifted by the addition of anti-Jun or anti-Fos antibodies but not by anti-Nrf2 antibodies (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that complex III includes the Jun/Fos proteins. We performed the DNA affinity purification assay to further analyze binding factors to the ARE. NF-E2p45 was detected in eluates from affinity beads conjugated with wild type ARE (AREW), but not from those with mutated ARE (AREM4), using nuclear extracts from untreated or hemin-treated cells. Nrf2 was only detected in eluates from AREW affinity beads using nuclear extracts from hemin-treated cells but not from untreated cells. We observed MafK in eluates from AREW beads using nuclear extracts from untreated or hemin-treated cells. In contrast, Jun and Fos proteins were only detected in eluates using nuclear extracts from PMA-treated cells (Fig.4). As nuclear translocation is considered to be an important mechanism of activation of transcription factors including Nrf2, we tested nuclear expression of Nrf2, NF-E2p45, small MafK, and the Jun/Fos proteins. The Jun and Fos proteins were detected in nuclei only after PMA stimulation. Staining with anti-NF-E2p45 or anti-MafK antibodies was shown in nuclei before and after hemin treatment. In contrast, Nrf2 proteins were stained in nuclei only after hemin treatment (Fig. 5 A). Because thioredoxin is translocated into nucleus by PMA (37Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), we also tested nuclear expression of thioredoxin in hemin treatment. Thioredoxin translocated into nuclei after PMA or hemin stimulation in K562 cells (Fig.5 A). We then examined nuclear expression of these factors by Western blotting. NF-E2p45 expression was detected in nuclear extracts without stimulation. However, after hemin or PMA treatment, the expression decreased. Nrf2 expression was augmented by hemin. In contrast, expression of the Jun/Fos proteins was augmented by PMA, not by hemin (Fig. 5 B). MafK remained in the nuclei before and after stimulation. Either hemin or PMA treatment augmented thioredoxin nuclear expression (Fig. 5 B). To further test whether Nrf2 and MafK was involved in the hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene, we used transient transfection experiments in K562 cells using pTrxAREWT-Luc. Overexpression of both Nrf2 and MafK augmented hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin promoter in K562 cells, dependent on the dose of Nrf2 (Fig.6 A). In addition, overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of Nrf2 suppressed hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene (Fig.6 B). These data collectively showed that Nrf2 and the small Maf proteins mediate the hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene. In the present study, we have shown that a region from −452 to −420 bp of the gene regulatory region of the thioredoxin gene is required for hemin responsiveness and is also important for basal expression of the thioredoxin gene. The sequence from position −452 to −420 bp of the human thioredoxin promoter is highly homologous to that from position −607 to −575 bp of the mouse thioredoxin gene (15Matsui M. Taniguchi Y. Hirota K. Taketo M. Yodoi J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 152: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), indicating that the sequence in the thioredoxin promoter is conserved in both the human and mouse thioredoxin genes. We previously reported an oxidative responsive element (ORE), which is the sequence from −953 to −930 bp and mediates the stress response of hydrogen peroxide (14Taniguchi Y. Taniguchi U.Y. Mori K. Yodoi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2746-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The possible contribution of ORE to the hemin response should be further examined. Sistonen and co-workers (18Leppa S. Pirkkala L. Chow S.C. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30400-30404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggested that HSF-2 mediates hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene. However, as observed in EMSA, specific binding complexes to the hemin responsive sequence were not affected by the addition of either unlabeled oligonucleotides encompassing HSE or antibodies against HSF-1 or HSF-2 (Fig. 3 A). These observations showed that HSFs are not included among proteins that bind to the sequence. Indeed, no typical consensus sequence for HSFs was identified in the thioredoxin gene. The possible involvement of HSFs in hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene should be further tested. In contrast, we found the TGCTGAGTAAC sequence, which resembles the ARE and AP-1 binding site, in the hemin responsive region of the thioredoxin promoter. Mutation in the ARE core sequence abolished the hemin response (M4 mutant in Fig.2 B), showing that the ARE is important for hemin-induced thioredoxin gene activation. We also observed a decrease of the hemin response with the M1 mutant (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the extended ARE sequence is necessary to be fully functional. This observation is consistent with a previous report (38Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), further indicating that hemin-induced thioredoxin gene activation is mediated by the ARE. In the EMSA and DNA affinity binding assays, we showed that NF-E2p45/small Maf complex constitutively binds to the ARE and that Nrf2/small Maf complex is induced to bind to the ARE by hemin (Figs. 3, B and C; and 4). Other members of small Maf proteins may also contribute to these complexes, although the level of MafK is higher than MafG in K562 cells (39Toki T. Itoh J. Kitazawa J. Arai K. Hatakeyama K. Akasaka J. Igarashi K. Nomura N. Yokoyama M. Yamamoto M. Ito E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Jun and Fos proteins have been reported to be involved in the binding complex to the ARE (21Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In our experiment, we could not detect members of the Jun/Fos proteins in constitutively bound or hemin-induced binding complexes to the ARE (Figs. 3, C andD; and 4). In contrast, the binding of the Jun/Fos proteins to the ARE was detected only after PMA stimulation (Figs. 3,C and D; and 4). Taken together, we here propose a model that the ARE of the thioredoxin gene is regulated by a switch of its binding proteins (Fig.7). This change of binding proteins seemed to be regulated by the control of nuclear expression of ARE and AP-1 binding factors, because their nuclear expression pattern (Fig. 5) correlated well with the binding to the ARE (Figs. 3 and 4). Nuclear expression of these factors may be regulated by several mechanisms. Cycloheximide treatment abolished hemin-induced binding to the ARE, 2H. Masutani, unpublished observations. suggesting an involvement of protein synthesis. Induction of small Maf protein synthesis is reported in β-naphthoflavone-induced activation of the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase subunit gene (43Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In our data, the nuclear expression of MafK was unchanged or slightly augmented by hemin treatment. In contrast, Nrf2 nuclear expression was significantly augmented by hemin. The hemin-induced binding of Nrf2 to the ARE of thioredoxin gene was not preceded by augmentation of Nrf2 mRNA level (data not shown). Our results using confocal microscopy showed hemin-induced up-regulation of Nrf2 expression in nuclei. These data are consistent with a previous study that reports exposure to electrophilic agents does not change the Nrf2 steady-state mRNA level and liberates Nrf2 from Keap1, leading to Nrf2 nuclear translocation (30Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of translocation and turnover of Nrf2 protein seems to be an important mechanism for hemin-induced augmentation of nuclear Nrf2 expression. Meanwhile, the reason for the decrease of nuclear expression of NF-E2p45 after hemin or PMA treatment (Fig. 5) is currently unclear. Regulation of nuclear export of Bach2 by oxidative stress has been reported (44Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nuclear expression of NF-E2p45 may also be regulated at the level of nuclear export. Overexpression of both Nrf2 and small Maf protein augmented hemin-induced thioredoxin gene activation, which was dependent on the dose of Nrf2. In contrast, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Nrf2 suppressed hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene (Fig. 6). Therefore, the major stimulatory effect on the thioredoxin gene by hemin seemed to be mediated by Nrf2 and small Maf proteins. Meanwhile, the role of the Jun/Fos proteins in the regulation of the ARE remains to be clarified. PMA stimulation did not change the luciferase activity using the pTrxAREWT-Luc vector (data not shown), suggesting that the PMA-induced switch from NF-E2p45/small Maf to the Jun/Fos proteins does not change the activation status of the thioredoxin gene in K562 cells. In other tissues or developmental stages, however, the Jun/Fos proteins might be important for basal and inducible thioredoxin gene activation. In addition, we can also speculate that in a pathological condition, perturbation of signal to the ARE by dysregulated activation of the AP-1 system causes dysregulation of differentiation process, resulting in oncogenesis. It is important to note that the phase II enzyme genes such as the human and rat NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase genes, the rat and murine glutathione S-transferase Ya genes, and the human γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase subunit gene all contain the ARE. Nrf2 has been shown to be a regulator of the phase II enzyme genes (30Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar, 43Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Thus, thioredoxin and these redox enzymes all have a common regulatory mechanism and may have co-ordinated roles against oxidative stress. Moreover, thioredoxin may be involved in cytoprotection against heme- and iron-related oxidative stress. Hemin, iron, and hemoglobin are promoters of free radical formation (46Tappel A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 721-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gutteridge J.M. Smith A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Heme release from hemoglobin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury (48Balla J. Jacob H.S. Balla G. Nath K. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that thioredoxin expression is induced in ischemic reperfusion (13Masutani H. Ueno M. Ueda S. Yodoi J. Sen C.K. Sies H. Baeuerle P.A. Antioxidant and Redox Regulation of Genes. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 297-311Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is also reported to facilitate the induction of the heme oxygenase-1 (49Wiesel P. Foster L.C. Pellacani A. Layne M.D. Hsieh C-M. Huggins G.S. Strauss P. Yet S-F. Perrela M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24840-24846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Collectively, study of the regulation of hemin-induced thioredoxin gene activation may lead to the clarification of the molecular basis of host defense against heme-induced oxidative stress-associated conditions such as reperfusion injury. In addition, because thioredoxin has a potent reducing activity, the current study indicates a role of thioredoxin in the protection against oxidation of hemoglobin in erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, our results show nuclear translocation of thioredoxin after PMA or hemin stimulation (Fig. 5). CNC-bZIP transcription factors and the Jun/Fos proteins have conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues (40Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Because the thioredoxin system has an important role in the redox regulation of transcription factors, ARE-mediated thioredoxin gene activation may contribute to the regulation of ARE binding factors. Finally, we have previously reported that thioredoxin negatively regulates p38 MAP kinase activation (50Hashimoto S. Matsumoto K. Gon Y. Furuichi S. Maruoka S. Takeshita I. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Horie T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We observed suppression of hemin-induced activation of the thioredoxin gene by p38 MAP kinase inhibitors in K562 cells, suggesting the involvement of the p38 MAP kinase system in the activation of the thioredoxin gene.2It is possible to speculate that ARE-mediated thioredoxin gene activation is a negative feedback mechanism. Meanwhile, a recent report showed that the heme oxygenase-1 gene is activated through the ARE by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK-1, but not by p38 MAP kinase (51Yu R. Mandlekar S. Tan T.-H. Kong A.N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9612-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, another report showed that protein kinase C-mediated Nrf2 phosphorylation is involved in the PMA-induced activation of the ARE (52Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), although we observed only slight augmentation of nuclear expression of Nrf2 after PMA treatment (Fig. 5). Our results and these studies indicate that several distinct signaling pathways lead to the ARE, depending on individual stimulus and cell types. Further work is in progress to elucidate the upstream pathway to the ARE of the thioredoxin gene. We thank Y. Kanekiyo for secretarial help, Dr. F. Hosoi for preparation of antibody, and Drs. H. Nakamura, Y. Ishii, and A. Nishiyama for discussion."

We have utilized two independent approaches, DNA microarrays and proteomics, to analyze the expression profile of human CD14+ blood monocytes and their derived DCs. Analysis of gene expression changes at the RNA level using oligonucleotide microarrays complementary to 6300 human genes showed that ∼40% of the genes were expressed in DCs. A total of 255 genes (4%) were found to be regulated during DC differentiation or maturation. Most of these genes were not previously associated with DCs and included genes encoding secreted proteins as well as genes involved in cell adhesion, signaling, and lipid metabolism. Protein analysis of the same cell populations was done using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A total of 900 distinct protein spots were included, and 4% of them exhibited quantitative changes during DC differentiation and maturation. Differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and found to represent proteins with Ca2+ binding, fatty acid binding, or chaperone activities as well as proteins involved in cell motility. In addition, proteomic analysis provided an assessment of post-translational modifications. The chaperone protein, calreticulin, was found to undergo cleavage, yielding a novel form.

As “professional” antigen-presenting cells, they are specialized to take up, process, and present soluble antigens in complexes with either class I or class II MHC molecules (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12080) Google Scholar, 2Banchereau J. Briere F. Caux C. Davoust J. Lebecque S. Liu Y.J. Pulendran B. Palucka K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 767-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (5533) Google Scholar). They are present in most tissues in a relatively immature state, but in the presence of inflammatory signals, they rapidly take up foreign antigens and undergo maturation into potent antigen-presenting cells that migrate to lymphoid organs where they initiate an immune response. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics are intimately linked to their stage of maturation. However, the specific genes whose expression mediates differentiation of pluripotent progenitors to DCs are largely undefined. The generation of large numbers of DCs has become feasible through the in vitro culturing of progenitors using exogenous hematopoietic cytokines to support their growth, differentiation, and maturation (3Young J.W. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1999; 6: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Avigan D. Blood Rev. 1999; 13: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human myeloid DCs can be generated from various sources, including blood, bone marrow, and CD34+ stem cells. Monocytes from peripheral blood have served as a ready source for generating myeloid DCs in vitrofollowing incubation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) for use in immunotherapy (4Avigan D. Blood Rev. 1999; 13: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Timmerman J.M. Levy R. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 507-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 6Geiger J. Hutchinson R. Hohenkirk L. McKenna E. Chang A. Mule J. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1163-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, DCs have become accessible for detailed molecular and cell biological analysis and for clinical applications. Microarrays and proteomics technologies for identifying the mRNA and protein constituents of living organisms and determining their pattern of expression are emerging (7Lockhart D.J. Winzeler E.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar, 8Huttlin E.L.

Nature. 2000; 405: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). Few studies have been undertaken that simultaneously analyzed cell populations at both RNA and protein levels. Potential sources of discordance between RNA and protein levels include translational control and altered protein stability. Additionally, proteomic analysis may uncover post-translational modifications that are not predictable at the RNA level. Here we used in vitro cultures of circulating CD14+ monocytes treated with GM-CSF and IL-4 followed by treatment with TNF-α, in order to analyze systematically gene expression during DC differentiation and maturation, using both oligonucleotide microarrays and proteomics. Generation of DCs was performed as described previously (10Chen B. Shi Y. Smith J.D. Choi D. Geiger J.D. Mule J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4652-4661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from leukapheresis specimens of normal donors after Ficoll-Paque density gradient separation. PBMCs were washed twice in Hank's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were resuspended in XVIVO-15 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). PBMCs were incubated with anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody coated with microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), and CD14+ monocytes were isolated by passing the PBMCs through a magnetic cell separation system (Miltenyi Biotec). CD14+monocytes (2 × 107–4 × 107) were cultured in XVIVO-15 medium containing GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) and IL-4 (50 ng/ml). After 7 days of culture, fresh XVIVO-15 medium containing GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) and IL-4 (50 ng/ml) plus TNF-α (10 ng/ml) was added to the cells for 7 additional days. All cytokines were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The analysis of cell surface antigens was performed by direct immunofluorescence (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells were washed twice with culture cell medium and incubated for 30 min on ice with each test monoclonal antibody diluted to the optimal concentration for immunostaining. Labeled cells were then washed, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed for fluorescence. Data analysis was based on examination of 10,000 cells/sample. Staining was performed with the following FITC- and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled monoclonal antibodies: FITC-CD1a, FITC-CD14, FITC-HLA-DR, FITC-CD83, FITC-mouse IgG1, FITC-mouse IgG2 (all from PharMingen, San Diego, CA); PE-CD86 (Coulter/Immunotech, Miami, FL); and PE-mouse IgG1 (Becton Dickinson). Primary antibodies were compared with the appropriate isotype-matched controls. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and used to generate cRNA probes. Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the HuGeneFL arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 5 μg of the RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA by reverse transcription using a cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript Choice, Life Technologies, Inc.) with an oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site added 3′ of the poly(T) (Genset, La Jolla, CA). After second-strand synthesis, labeled cRNA was generated from the cDNA sample by an in vitro transcription reaction supplemented with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was purified by using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fifteen micrograms of each cRNA was fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm magnesium acetate) and then used to prepare 300 μl of hybridization mixture (100 mm MES, 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega), 1 m sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.005% Triton X-100) containing a mixture of control cRNAs for comparison of hybridization efficiency between arrays and for relative quantitation of measured transcript levels. Before hybridization, the cRNA samples were heated at 94 °C for 5 min, equilibrated at 45 °C for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation (14,000 ×g) at room temperature for 5 min. Aliquots of each sample (10 μg of cRNA in 200 μl of the master mix) were hybridized to HuGeneFL Arrays at 45 °C for 16 h in a rotisserie oven set at 60 rpm then washed with non stringent wash buffer (6 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA) at 25 °C, followed by stringent wash buffer (100 mm MES (pH 6.7), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) at 50 °C, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes), washed again with 6 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, stained with biotinylated anti-streptavidin lgG, followed by a second staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and a third washing with 6 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA. The arrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Data analysis was performed using GeneChip 4.0 software. The software includes algorithms that determine whether a gene is absent or present and whether the expression level of a gene in an experimental sample is significantly increased or decreased relative to a control sample. To assess differences in gene expression, we selected genes based on a sort score value equal or greater than 2. The sort score is calculated by Affymetrix software by using a combination of actual values of the average differences. The procedure followed was as described previously (11Strahler J.R. Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 65-92Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 9.5 murea (Bio-Rad), 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% carrier ampholytes pH 4–8 (Gallard/Schlessinger, Carle Place, NY), 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots containing ∼5 × 106 cells were applied onto isofocusing gels. Isoelectric focusing was conducted using pH 4–8 carrier ampholytes at 700 V for 16 h, followed by 1000 V for an additional 2 h. The first-dimension gel was loaded onto the second-dimension gel, after equilibration in 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue. For the second-dimension separation, a gradient of 11–14% of acrylamide (Serva, Crescent Chemical, Hauppauge, NY) was used. Proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) or visualized by silver staining of the gels (11Strahler J.R. Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 65-92Google Scholar, 12Strahler J.R. Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphoproteins were visualized by phosphorimaging technology. [32P]Orthophosphate labeling was performed by preincubating the cells for 2 h with 200 μCi/ml32PO43−(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in phosphate-free culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Heat shock treatment was then performed by incubating the cells for 1 h at 42–44 °C as described previously (12Strahler J.R. Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Zhou M. Lambert H. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfer, membranes were incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer containing 5% milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl. The membranes were incubated for 2 h with antibodies against calreticulin, SPA-600 (StressGen, Victoria, Canada), T-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), vimentin, V9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or FABP5 (kindly provided by Professor Celis, University of Aarhus, Denmark) at a dilution 1:1,000,000, 1:10,000, 1:100,000, and 1:1000, respectively. The membranes were then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or anti-goat (Sigma) IgG antibodies, at a dilution 1:1000. Immunodetection was accomplished by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by autoradiography on hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The two-dimensional gels were silver-stained by successive incubations in 0.02% sodium thiosulfate for 2 min, 0.1% silver nitrate for 40 min, and 0.014% formaldehyde plus 2% sodium carbonate. The proteins of interest were excised from the two-dimensional gels and destained for 5 min in 15 mmpotassium ferricyanide and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate as described (14Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R.

Following 3 washes with water, the gel pieces were dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile for 5 min and dried for 30 min in a vacuum centrifuge. Digestion was performed by addition of 100 ng of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate or by the addition of 100 ng of the endoproteinase Glu-C (Promega, Madison, WI) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The Lys-C digestion was performed with 500 ng of the endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9. Following enzymatic digestion overnight at 37 °C, the peptides were extracted twice with 50 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid. After removal of acetonitrile by centrifugation in a vacuum centrifuge, the peptides were concentrated by using pipette tips C18 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Analyses were performed primarily using a Perspective Biosystem matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) Voyager-DE mass spectrometer (Framingham, MA), operated in delayed extraction mode. Peptide mixtures were analyzed using a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in acetone containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma). Peptides were selected in the mass range of 800–4000 Da. Spectra were calibrated using calibration mixture 2 of the Sequazyme peptide mass standards kit (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The search program MS-Fit, developed by the University of California at San Francisco, was used for searches in the data base NCBI. Search parameters were as follows: maximum allowed peptide mass error of 400 ppm, consideration of one incomplete cleavage per peptide, and pH range between 4 and 8. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was also used for molecular weight determination as described (15Liang X. Bai J. Liu Y.-H. Lubman D.M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In some cases, the amino acid sequence of some peptides of interest was determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. Differentiation of CD14+ blood monocytes into mature dendritic cells can be induced in vitro by treatment with a combination of GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNF-α (10Chen B. Shi Y. Smith J.D. Choi D. Geiger J.D. Mule J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4652-4661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhou L.J. Tedder T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2588-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). We isolated CD14+ cells from PBMCs obtained from leukapheresis specimens of healthy donors. Adherent CD14+ monocytes were cultured for 7 days in the presence of GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) and IL-4 (50 ng/ml) followed by 7 additional days in the presence of GM-CSF (100 ng/ml), IL-4 (50 ng/ml), and TNF-α (10 ng/ml). The differentiation stage of the cells was determined by two criteria, morphology and cell surface expression of specific markers. At day 7, the DCs displayed phenotypic and morphologic characteristics of immature DCs. The cells expressed CD1a, the costimulatory molecule CD86 (50 and 52% positive cells, respectively), high levels of MHC class II antigens, while being negative for the monocyte marker CD14, as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Following further culture in the presence of TNF-α for 7 days, almost all the cells exhibited high levels of HLA-DR, CD86, and CD83, which represent markers of mature DC (Fig. 1) (16Zhou L.J. Tedder T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2588-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 17Hart D.N. Blood. 1997; 90: 3245-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fearnley D.B.

Ther. 1997; 3: 187-196PubMed Google Scholar). Development of the dendrite/neurite morphology was progressively more prevalent and pronounced after addition of TNF-α (data not shown). Furthermore, up-regulation of CD83 expression presented the same temporal kinetics as the morphologic changes. Three independent differentiation experiments were performed, and RNA transcript levels for different genes were determined at day 1 (CD14+monocytes) and after 7 days of GM-CSF/IL-4 treatment (immature DCs) and 14 days of GM-CSF/IL-4 plus TNF-α treatment (mature DCs), using oligonucleotide arrays. Transcripts for ∼40% of the 6,300 unique genes assessed were detected in all the cell populations tested. We identified a subset of genes that differed in their expression levels during DC differentiation and maturation, by 2.5-fold or greater, in all three experiments. The 255 genes identified are presented in Tables I and II, for up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. The number of genes whose expression decreased upon DC differentiation and/or maturation was as large as the number of genes whose expression increased. In addition, comparison of overall gene expression between immature and mature DCs showed only few differences. Genes known to be differentially expressed during DC differentiation changed their expression accordingly in our analysis. This group included the monocytic marker CD14, CD163, and C5a anaphylatoxin receptor (CD88), which were strongly down-regulated, and the cell surface proteins CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD36, CD59, CD83, CD86, and CCR7, which were up-regulated with DC differentiation and maturation. Up-regulation of Fc-ε RII and Fc-γ RII, of several genes encoding for MHC class II, and of genes encoding for the secreted proteins TARC (CCR4 ligand), MCP-4, and the macrophage-derived chemokine was also observed.Table IUp-regulated mRNAs in monocyte-derived DCsDescriptionGenBank™ accession no.Fold changeD7/D1D14/D7Cell surface proteinsCD1aM28825∼17.5−5.4CD1bM2882616.8−3.6CD1cM2882716−3.2Fc-ε RII/CD23AM1505912.2−2.3Macrophage mannose receptor (MRC1)M9322111.3NCCD36/FATZ225559.3NCMHC class II, HLA-DQAM349968.8NCMHC class II, HLA-DP light chainM574668.3NCMHC/HLA-DG protein 41M285906.6NCCCR7L31584NC6.5E-cadherinZ354025.72TIG1U27185∼5.42.8PKD2U509285.1NCC3b/C4b receptor (CR1)X05309∼5.0NCCD26/DPP4X60708NC∼5.0CD59M843494.61.9Integrin β5subunitX53002∼4.3NCTranscript associated with monocyte to macrophage differentiationX85750∼4.3NCFc-γ RIIb3/CD32M319334.1NCMHC class II, HLA-DR3,3K024053.8NCMHC class II, HLA-SB alphaX031003.3NCCD71M115072.9NCCD86U043432.8NCMHC class II, HLA-DQw1.1 β chainX030682.5NCClass II invariant γ chain/CD74M135602.4NCMHC class II, HLA-DRB2X655612.3NCCD83Z116971.64.7Secreted proteinsMacrophage metalloelastase (HME)L23808∼80.6NCTARC (CCR4 ligand)D4376726.53α2-macroglobulinM1131325.1NCMac-2-binding proteinL13210NC∼21.4MCP-4U46767∼18.62.5Factor XIIIaM14539∼16.1−3.9Growth arrest-specific Gas6L13720∼14.7NCCathepsin CX8721213.1NCMacrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)U8317110.1NCBikuninU780958.6NCComplement C1q B chainK034306.9NCBone-derived growth factor (BPGF-1)L423795.6NCTNF-inducible protein 6 (TSG-6)M31165NC∼5.4TGF-βAB0005845NCExtracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1)U659324.9NCSemaphorin EAB0002204.6NCCSF-1M374354.4NCOsteopontinU207584.2NCActivin βAsubunitX575793.5NCAutotaxin-tL46720∼3.4NCTGF-αX70340NC3Nuclear proteinsDHP2U56814∼14.54.5MINORU1276710.4NCPPAR-γL409049NCLXR-αU226628.5NCInterferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4)U52682∼8.23.4C/EBPaU340705.1∼−10SOX-4X70683NC3.9AES-1X733583.5NCTRIP7L403573.22.1SnRNPJ046153.1NCMrg1U650933NCSignal transduction/growth controlRILX93510∼24.2NCGTPase-activating protein (Rap1GAP)M64788∼18.4∼−16Cyclin D2D136399.5−2.2Inhibitor of apoptosis MIHCU37546NC8Dual-specificity phosphatase 5U15932∼7.6NCCyclophilin CS71018∼5.71.6StacD86640∼5.3NCcAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, CβM34181∼5.1NCPutative serine/threonine kinase GS3955D87119∼4.8NCSHBX753424.6NCTyrosine phosphataseZ485414.2NCCRABP-IIM978154.1NCCyclin A1U668383.6NCSrc-like adapter proteinD890773.1NCCyclin HU117913NCDual-specificity phosphatase 1X682772.92.2Inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase BX572062.8NCCyclin G2U474142.5NCADP-ribosylation factor 4M36341NC2.2Metabolism/enzymesAcyl-CoA thioester hydrolase (ACT)U91316∼28.4NCFABP4J02874∼25.22TransglutaminaseM55153∼13.14.2Na,K-ATPase β1 subunitU16799∼12.7NCMonoamine oxidase A (MAOA)M68840∼11NC15-LipoxygenaseM23892∼8.5NCPlatelet-type phosphofructokinaseD253288.0NCApolipoprotein EM125297.5NCPhosphofructokinaseU24183NC7.1Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)M158566.2−2.2l-Arginine:glycine amidinotransferaseS68805∼6.2NCPhosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteinX752525.8NCATP-binding cassette, G (White)/ABCG1X912495.7NCLysosomal acid lipaseZ316904.9NCFABP3U576234.8NCCystathionine-β-synthaseL009724.6NCCytochromeb5M229764.53.1HSD11M766654.5NCK+ channel β2 subunitU334294.4NCNramp2L37347∼4.0NCFABP5M948563.8NCProtease inhibitor 6S692723.81.5Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetaseD284733.6NC3-Oxoacyl-CoA thiolaseD162943.5NCCatalaseX040853.3NCIndoleamine-2,3-dioxygenaseM34455NC3.2Pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCBD)L415593.0NCRNase AD261293−2.1RNASE6U649983NCOrnithine aminotransferaseM299272.9NCSulfotransferase 1CU66036NC2.9α-2,6-SialyltransferaseX62822∼2.72.1Apolipoprotein C-IM209022.5NCLysophospholipase homolog (HU-K5)U679632.32.1Not classifiedKIAA0074D38553∼30.6NCKIAA0193D83777∼6.3NCKIAA0179D800013.9NCHepatitis δ ag interacting protein A (dipA)U638253.3−2.2KIAA0100D439473.2NCSPTAN1J052433NCClone zap128L404013NCRNA from CD14+ monocytes (D1), immature (D7), and mature (D14) DCs were hybridized onto Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays and quantified as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” For each gene, the fold change was calculated by Affymetrix software; NC indicates no change; the ∼ indicates fold change calculation for which the smaller value is replaced by an estimate of the minimum value for detectable transcripts.

https://openalex.org/W2042948648,"The kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)-cyclin E is required for centrosomes to initiate duplication. We have recently found that nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), a phosphoprotein primarily found in nucleolus, associates with unduplicated centrosomes and is a direct substrate of CDK2-cyclin E in centrosome duplication. Upon phosphorylation by CDK2-cyclin E, NPM/B23 dissociates from centrosomes, which is a prerequisite step for centrosomes to initiate duplication. Here, we identified that threonine 199 (Thr199) of NPM/B23 is the major phosphorylation target site of CDK2-cyclin E in vitro, and the same site is phosphorylated in vivo. NPM/T199A, a nonphosphorylatable NPM/B23 substitution mutant (Thr199 → Ala) acts as dominant negative when expressed in cells, resulting in specific inhibition of centrosome duplication. As expected, NPM/T199A remains associated with the centrosomes. These observations provide direct evidence that the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation on Thr199 determines association and dissociation of NPM/B23 to the centrosomes, which is a critical control for the centrosome to initiate duplication.

Since each daughter cell inherits one centrosome upon cytokinesis, the centrosome must duplicate prior to the next mitosis and do so only once. Thus, centrosome duplication must take place in coordination with other cell cycle events including DNA synthesis. In mammalian cells, the centriole, the core component of the centrosome, initiates duplication at the G1/S boundary (reviewed in Refs. 4Mazia D. Int. Rev.

Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We have shown that NPM/B23 associates specifically with unduplicated centrosomes, and this association is controlled by CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation, in which NPM/B23 loses its affinity to centrosomes in its phosphorylated form (16Okuda M.

For instance, microinjection of the anti-NPM/B23 monoclonal antibody, which blocks the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation of NPM/B23, inhibits centrosome duplication. Moreover, ectopic expression of this NPM/B23 deletion mutant (NPM(Δ186–239)), which is unable to be phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E, results in suppression of centrosome duplication. These results demonstrate that dissociation of centrosomal NPM/B23 by CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation is critical for initiation of centrosome duplication and that the site(s) of NPM/B23 phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E lies within the sequence between amino acid residues 186 and 239.We here show that Thr199 of NPM/B23 is specifically phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E in vitro, and this phosphorylation is also observed in vivo. When NPM/B23 mutant with a substitution of this specific threonine residue to alanine (nonphosphorylatable) is expressed in cells, it affects centrosome duplication in a dominant negative fashion, resulting in suppression of centrosome duplication. These observations provide direct evidence that the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation of NPM/B23 on Thr199 is critical for dissociation of centrosomal NPM/B23 and initiation of centrosome duplication.DISCUSSIONCentrosome hyperamplification, which leads to formation of aberrant mitotic spindles, is now well accepted as one of the major causes of chromosome instability in human cancers (36Pihan G.A.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1935-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In normal cells, the centrosome duplication cycle is tightly regulated. Coordinated initiation of centrosome and DNA duplication is one of the major regulatory checkpoints for proper progression of the centrosome duplication cycle, and it is established at least in part by the late G1-specific activation of CDK2-cyclin E (7Hinchcliffe E.H. Li C. Thompson E.A. Maller J.L. Sluder G. Science. 1999; 283: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 8Lacey K.R. Jackson P.K. Stearns T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar).Activation of CDK2-cyclin E plays a major role in the initiation of DNA synthesis through phosphorylation of retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (pRb). When pRb is phosphorylated, it releases the pRb-bound E2F transcriptional factor, which then stimulates the transcription of a number of genes required for DNA synthesis (for reviews, see Refs. 40Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholarand 41Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for E2F has also been implicated in the initiation of centrosome duplication (42Meraldi P. Lukas J. Fry A.M. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), suggesting that E2F-dependent expression of specific protein(s) may be needed for centrosome duplication. Indeed, it has been shown that, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, synthesis of certain centrosomal proteins during G1 is necessary for the initiation of centrosome duplication (43Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. Brinkley B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, CDK2-cyclin E has been shown to directly act on a centrosomal protein to initiate centrosome duplication. NPM/B23 binds specifically to unduplicated centrosomes and loses its centrosome binding activity when phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E. Dissociation of the centrosomal NPM/B23 appears to be a prerequisite for the centrosomes to initiate duplication, since centrosome duplication is blocked by microinjection of anti-NPM/B23 antibody, which prevents CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation and dissociation of centrosomal NPM/B23 (16Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that NPM/B23 deletion mutant (NPM(Δ186–239)), which fails to be phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E, acts as a dominant negative when expressed in cells, resulting in suppression of centrosome duplication (16Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified Thr199 as the CDK2-cyclin E phosphorylation target site of NPM/B23 both in vitro and in vivo. The NPM/B23 mutant with an alanine substitution at this site (NPM/T199A) acts as a dominant negative when expressed in cells and suppresses centrosome duplication, similar to the NPM(Δ186–239) deletion mutant. The initial stage of centrosome duplication consists of a series of distinct steps: loss of orthogonal configuration and physical separation of the centriole pair, which is followed by synthesis of a procentriole next to each preexisting centriole. Co-immunostaining of centrosomes in the NPM/T199A-transfected cells with anti-α-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies detected anti-α-tubulin antibody-reactive doublets (a centriole pair) within the anti-γ-tubulin antibody-reactive dot (pericentriolar material), suggesting that the duplication of centrosomes in the NPM/T199A-transfected cells is blocked in the early stage. This is consistent with our earlier finding using cells expressing NPM(Δ186–239), the nonphosphorylatable deletion mutant, by thin section transmission electron microscopy (16Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In these cells, unduplicated centrosomes are physically intact with the orthogonal configuration of the centriole pair, which is typical of those found in early G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, similar to the nonphosphorylatable deletion mutant, expression of NPM/T199A mutant blocks the early step of centrosome duplication. Dominant negative activity of NPM/T199A on centrosome duplication is further evidenced by the high frequency of aberrant mitoses with monopolar spindles in the NPM/T199A-transfected cells, resulting from cell cycle progression to mitosis, without centrosome duplication. These observations provide direct evidence that CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation of NPM/B23 comprises one of the key events in the initiation of centrosome duplication. At present, the molecular basis of the centrosome-binding property of NPM/B23 (i.e. which centrosomal protein(s) the unphosphorylated form of NPM/B23 associates with) is unknown. The identification of the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation site will, however, expedite the elucidation of the particular centrosomal component(s) with which NPM/B23 directly associates.Another important issue of the inhibition of centrosome duplication by expression of NPM/T199A mutant is the consequence of monopolar spindle formation. Considering the role of the centrosomes (spindle poles) in cytokinesis (47Rappaport R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 105: 245-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), it is safe to assume that monopolar mitotic cells do not undergo cytokinesis. If these cells enter the next cell cycle without cytokinesis, we should expect an increase in the number of cells with abnormal amplification of genome. However, the flow cytometric analysis of the NPM/T199A-transfected cells failed to detect any noticeable increase in the number of cells with abnormally amplified genome (data not shown), suggesting that formation of monopolar spindles probably leads to cell death. However, the mechanism of how cell death is induced in the monopolar mitotic cells remains to be clarified.NPM/B23 associates with and dissociates from centrosomes in a cell cycle stage-specific manner (16Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 44Zatsepina O.V. Rousselet A. Chan P.K. Olson M.O. Jordan E.G. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar). During early to middle G1, NPM/B23 associates with the unduplicated centrosomes. In late G1, NPM/B23 dissociates from the centrosomes upon phosphorylation by CDK2-cyclin E. During S and G2 phases, association of NPM/B23 with the duplicated centrosomes is not detected. However, during mitosis, NPM/B23 reassociates with the centrosomes. This cell cycle stage-dependent dissociation and reassociation of NPM/B23 with centrosomes may be controlled by differential phosphorylation by CDK-cyclin complexes. CDK2-cyclin E activity peaks during late G1, triggering dissociation of the centrosomal NPM/B23. Upon entry into S phase, cyclin E expression becomes halted. Since cyclin E is intrinsically unstable, cyclin E-dependent CDK2 activity becomes minimal during S phase (9Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 10Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In contrast, the level of cyclin A is low in late G1 but increases during S and G2 phases (27Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 28Marraccino R.L. Firpo E.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Carbonaro-Hall D. Williams R. Wu L. Warburton D. Zeichner-David M. MacDougall M. Tolo V. Hall F.

Thus, during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, CDK2-cyclin A activity is high. We found that CDK2-cyclin A could also phosphorylate NPM/B23 specifically on Thr199 in vitro at an efficiency similar to CDK2-cyclin E. Thus, it is possible that the continual presence of active CDK2-cyclin A is responsible for preventing the reassociation of NPM/B23 to centrosomes during S and G2. Moreover, NPM/B23 has previously been shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1-cyclin B, a mitotic CDK-cyclin complex (32Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We found that CDK1-cyclin B specifically phosphorylates Thr234 and Thr237 in vitro, which are different from CDK2-cyclin E (and cyclin A)-mediated phosphorylation sites. It remains to be investigated whether phosphorylation of Thr234 and/or Thr237 by CDK1-cyclin B is required for reassociation of NPM/B23 with the centrosomes during mitosis. These questions are currently addressed in our laboratory.NPM/BNPM/B23 has been shown to participate in various cellular events that are to all appearances unrelated to each other, including ribosome assembly, intracellular trafficking, DNA polymerase activity, and centrosome duplication. These diverse functions of NPM/B23 are perhaps attributed to its molecular chaperoning activity as reported previously (22Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). All of the cellular events in which NPM/B23 has been shown to function involve either large multiprotein complexes or organelles consisting of many different proteins in a crowded condition. Thus, association/dissociation of NPM/B23 may dramatically influence the centrosome proper and thus determine the structural as well as functional state of the centrosome. Moreover, the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated functional modification of NPM/B23 may target other cellular event(s) as well, since the BrdUrd incorporation assay showed that expression of NPM/T199A mutant partially blocks (or slows down) the cell cycle progression. The centrosome, a major microtubule-organizing center of the animal cells, directs the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation to daughter cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1Brinkley B.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 145-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 2Bornens M. Kalnins V.I. The Centrosome.

Since each daughter cell inherits one centrosome upon cytokinesis, the centrosome must duplicate prior to the next mitosis and do so only once. Thus, centrosome duplication must take place in coordination with other cell cycle events including DNA synthesis. In mammalian cells, the centriole, the core component of the centrosome, initiates duplication at the G1/S boundary (reviewed in Refs. 4Mazia D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1987; 100: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Vandre D.D. Borisy G.G. Hyams J.S. Brinkley B.R. Mitosis: Molecules and Mechanisms.

Activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)1-cyclin E has recently been found to be essential for the centrosome to initiate duplication (7Hinchcliffe E.H. Li C. Thompson E.A. Maller J.L. Sluder G. Science. 1999; 283: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 8Lacey K.R. Jackson P.K. Stearns T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The activity of CDK2-cyclin E is regulated by the temporal expression of cyclin E, which normally occurs in late G1 (9Koff A.

Reed S. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), and it has been known that active CDK2-cyclin E complexes are required for initiation of DNA replication (11van der Heuvel S.

Li C. Thompson E.A. Maller J.L. Sluder G. Science. 1999; 283: 851-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 8Lacey K.R. Jackson P.K. Stearns T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar).Activation of CDK2-cyclin E plays a major role in the initiation of DNA synthesis through phosphorylation of retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (pRb). When pRb is phosphorylated, it releases the pRb-bound E2F transcriptional factor, which then stimulates the transcription of a number of genes required for DNA synthesis (for reviews, see Refs. 40Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholarand 41Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for E2F has also been implicated in the initiation of centrosome duplication (42Meraldi P. Lukas J. Fry A.M. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), suggesting that E2F-dependent expression of specific protein(s) may be needed for centrosome duplication. Indeed, it has been shown that, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, synthesis of certain centrosomal proteins during G1 is necessary for the initiation of centrosome duplication (43Balczon R. Bao L. Zimmer W.E. Brown K. Zinkowski R.P. Brinkley B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition, CDK2-cyclin E has been shown to directly act on a centrosomal protein to initiate centrosome duplication. NPM/B23 binds specifically to unduplicated centrosomes and loses its centrosome binding activity when phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E. Dissociation of the centrosomal NPM/B23 appears to be a prerequisite for the centrosomes to initiate duplication, since centrosome duplication is blocked by microinjection of anti-NPM/B23 antibody, which prevents CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation and dissociation of centrosomal NPM/B23 (16Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that NPM/B23 deletion mutant (NPM(Δ186–239)), which fails to be phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E, acts as a dominant negative when expressed in cells, resulting in suppression of centrosome duplication (16Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified Thr199 as the CDK2-cyclin E phosphorylation target site of NPM/B23 both in vitro and in vivo. The NPM/B23 mutant with an alanine substitution at this site (NPM/T199A) acts as a dominant negative when expressed in cells and suppresses centrosome duplication, similar to the NPM(Δ186–239) deletion mutant. The initial stage of centrosome duplication consists of a series of distinct steps: loss of orthogonal configuration and physical separation of the centriole pair, which is followed by synthesis of a procentriole next to each preexisting centriole. Co-immunostaining of centrosomes in the NPM/T199A-transfected cells with anti-α-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin antibodies detected anti-α-tubulin antibody-reactive doublets (a centriole pair) within the anti-γ-tubulin antibody-reactive dot (pericentriolar material), suggesting that the duplication of centrosomes in the NPM/T199A-transfected cells is blocked in the early stage. This is consistent with our earlier finding using cells expressing NPM(Δ186–239), the nonphosphorylatable deletion mutant, by thin section transmission electron microscopy (16Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In these cells, unduplicated centrosomes are physically intact with the orthogonal configuration of the centriole pair, which is typical of those found in early G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, similar to the nonphosphorylatable deletion mutant, expression of NPM/T199A mutant blocks the early step of centrosome duplication. Dominant negative activity of NPM/T199A on centrosome duplication is further evidenced by the high frequency of aberrant mitoses with monopolar spindles in the NPM/T199A-transfected cells, resulting from cell cycle progression to mitosis, without centrosome duplication. These observations provide direct evidence that CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation of NPM/B23 comprises one of the key events in the initiation of centrosome duplication. At present, the molecular basis of the centrosome-binding property of NPM/B23 (i.e. which centrosomal protein(s) the unphosphorylated form of NPM/B23 associates with) is unknown. The identification of the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation site will, however, expedite the elucidation of the particular centrosomal component(s) with which NPM/B23 directly associates.Another important issue of the inhibition of centrosome duplication by expression of NPM/T199A mutant is the consequence of monopolar spindle formation. Considering the role of the centrosomes (spindle poles) in cytokinesis (47Rappaport R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 105: 245-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), it is safe to assume that monopolar mitotic cells do not undergo cytokinesis. If these cells enter the next cell cycle without cytokinesis, we should expect an increase in the number of cells with abnormal amplification of genome. However, the flow cytometric analysis of the NPM/T199A-transfected cells failed to detect any noticeable increase in the number of cells with abnormally amplified genome (data not shown), suggesting that formation of monopolar spindles probably leads to cell death. However, the mechanism of how cell death is induced in the monopolar mitotic cells remains to be clarified.NPM/B23 associates with and dissociates from centrosomes in a cell cycle stage-specific manner (16Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 44Zatsepina O.V. Rousselet A. Chan P.K. Olson M.O. Jordan E.G. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar). During early to middle G1, NPM/B23 associates with the unduplicated centrosomes. In late G1, NPM/B23 dissociates from the centrosomes upon phosphorylation by CDK2-cyclin E. During S and G2 phases, association of NPM/B23 with the duplicated centrosomes is not detected. However, during mitosis, NPM/B23 reassociates with the centrosomes. This cell cycle stage-dependent dissociation and reassociation of NPM/B23 with centrosomes may be controlled by differential phosphorylation by CDK-cyclin complexes. CDK2-cyclin E activity peaks during late G1, triggering dissociation of the centrosomal NPM/B23. Upon entry into S phase, cyclin E expression becomes halted. Since cyclin E is intrinsically unstable, cyclin E-dependent CDK2 activity becomes minimal during S phase (9Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 10Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In contrast, the level of cyclin A is low in late G1 but increases during S and G2 phases (27Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 28Marraccino R.L. Firpo E.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Biol.

Thus, during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, CDK2-cyclin A activity is high. We found that CDK2-cyclin A could also phosphorylate NPM/B23 specifically on Thr199 in vitro at an efficiency similar to CDK2-cyclin E. Thus, it is possible that the continual presence of active CDK2-cyclin A is responsible for preventing the reassociation of NPM/B23 to centrosomes during S and G2. Moreover, NPM/B23 has previously been shown to be phosphorylated by CDK1-cyclin B, a mitotic CDK-cyclin complex (32Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We found that CDK1-cyclin B specifically phosphorylates Thr234 and Thr237 in vitro, which are different from CDK2-cyclin E (and cyclin A)-mediated phosphorylation sites. It remains to be investigated whether phosphorylation of Thr234 and/or Thr237 by CDK1-cyclin B is required for reassociation of NPM/B23 with the centrosomes during mitosis. These questions are currently addressed in our laboratory.NPM/BNPM/B23 has been shown to participate in various cellular events that are to all appearances unrelated to each other, including ribosome assembly, intracellular trafficking, DNA polymerase activity, and centrosome duplication. These diverse functions of NPM/B23 are perhaps attributed to its molecular chaperoning activity as reported previously (22Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). All of the cellular events in which NPM/B23 has been shown to function involve either large multiprotein complexes or organelles consisting of many different proteins in a crowded condition. Thus, association/dissociation of NPM/B23 may dramatically influence the centrosome proper and thus determine the structural as well as functional state of the centrosome. Moreover, the CDK2-cyclin E-mediated functional modification of NPM/B23 may target other cellular event(s) as well, since the BrdUrd incorporation assay showed that expression of NPM/T199A mutant partially blocks (or slows down) the cell cycle progression. Centrosome hyperamplification, which leads to formation of aberrant mitotic spindles, is now well accepted as one of the major causes of chromosome instability in human cancers (36Pihan G.A.

Like most proteinases, the activity of MMP-9 is tightly regulated. MMP activity is modulated by a family of specific inhibitors, termed tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) (8Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar). TIMPs regulate MMP activity during extracellular matrix turnover, and ablation of TIMP gene expression results in enhanced extracellular matrix proteolysis concomitant with up-regulation of cell invasive activity (9Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M. Norton G. Denhardt D.T. Science. 1989; 243: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 10Alexander C.M. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate a unique role for TIMPs independent of their ability to inhibit MMPs by demonstrating that TIMP-2 can directly regulate tyrosine kinase-type growth factor receptor activation (11Hoegy S.E. Oh H.R. Corcoran M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3203-3214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). An additional pathway capable of regulating the levels of MMP-13 was recently discovered when Barmina et al. (12Barmina O.Y. Walling H.W. Fiacco G.J. Freije J.M. Lopez-Otin C. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30087-30093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) identified cellular receptors that are able to bind MMP-13. One of these receptors, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), mediates the internalization and degradation of this proteinase. LRP, a member of the LDL receptor superfamily, also modulates levels of MMP-2 by binding and internalizing MMP-2-thrombospondin 2 (TSP2) complexes (13Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In both of these studies, the catabolism of MMPs was inhibited by a 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP). This molecule binds reversibly to LRP (14Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other members of the LDL receptor family such as gp330/megalin (15Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the VLDL receptor (16Battey F. Gåfvels M.E. Fitzgerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits ligand binding by these receptors (14Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAP is found primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions as a molecular chaperone by assisting in receptor folding and processing (18Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and preventing the association of newly synthesized receptors with endogenous ligands (19Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Due to its high affinity for LRP and ability to antagonize ligand binding, exogenously added RAP constitutes a powerful tool to study LRP-mediated mechanisms. In the current investigation, we report that the levels of MMP-9 in conditioned cell culture media are increased significantly when cells are grown in the presence of RAP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MMP-9 directly binds with high affinity to LRP and that this receptor mediates the internalization and subsequent degradation of this enzyme. Based on these studies, we propose that clearance of MMP-9 by LRP is an important mechanism for regulating extracellular levels of this proteinase. Human RAP was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase as described previously (14Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage with thrombin and purification of recombinant RAP was carried out as described (14Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modification. After elution from glutathione S-transferase-Sepharose, RAP was placed on a MonoS column equilibrated with 0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 2 m NaCl over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The RAP was then recycled three times over AffinityPakTM Detoxi-GelTMendotoxin-removing gel (Pierce). LRP was purified by ligand affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (20Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). MMP-9·TIMP-1 and MMP-2·TIMP-2 complexes were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). A fragment containing the eight ligand binding repeats of the human VLDL receptor (VLDLr1–8) was generated as a GST fusion protein as described (21Hembrough, T.A., Ruiz, J. F., Papathanassiu, A. E., Green, S. J., and Strickland, D. K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). After purification and digestion with thrombin to release the VLDLr1–8, refolding and purification of the soluble receptor fragment was accomplished as described (21Hembrough, T.A., Ruiz, J. F., Papathanassiu, A. E., Green, S. J., and Strickland, D. K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Anti-MMP-9 and anti-MMP-2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-LRP monoclonal antibody 8G1 (22Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was produced and purified as described previously. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to either horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Bio-Rad. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA-10, LRP(+/−); PEA-13, LRP(−/−); mouse embryonic fibroblasts, LRP(+/+)) (23Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In the experiments involving RAP treatment, subconfluent cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of 500 nm recombinant RAP (RAP-treated) for 24 h in serum-free medium supplemented with Nutridoma® -NS media supplement (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This 24 h-conditioned medium was then analyzed by gelatin zymography to detect both MMP-2 and MMP-9. Gelatin gels (10%) and Zymogram developing buffer (10×) were purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA) and used as described (24Chen J.M. Aimes R.T. Ward G.R. Youngleib G.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5113-5121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hahn-Dantona E.A. Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40827-40838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were diluted in nonreducing SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% gelatin gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed 2× 30 min in 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated 16 h at 37 °C in 1× Zymogram developing buffer. After incubation, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (0.3% in 50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid) and destained with 10% glacial acetic acid, 10% isopropanol, 5% glycerol. The gels were scanned using an AFGA scanner and converted to TIFF files, and optical density analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. Ligands (MMP-9, MMP-2, and BSA) were coated on microtiter wells at 4 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris, 150 nm NaCl (TBS) with 1 mm CaCl2 for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed 3× with TBS, 1 mm CaCl2 and blocked with 0.3% BSA in TBS, 1 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, wells were incubated for at 4 °C in increasing concentrations of LRP in TBS, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.05% Tween 0 with 0.3% BSA. The wells were washed 3× with 0.3% BSA in TBS, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20. Bound LRP was detected with monoclonal antibody 8G1 (1 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The wells were then incubated in phosphatase substrate (Sigma 104) in 0.1 m glycine, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, pH 10.4,until color development. The absorbance for each sample was measured at 405 nm. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using the equation, A=Amax[ligand]KD+[ligand]+AminEquation 1 where A is the absorbance at 405 nm,Amax is the absorbance value at saturation,Amin is the background absorbance in the absence of ligand, [ligand] is the molar concentration of free ligand, andKD is the dissociation constant. Since the free ligand concentration is unknown in these experiments, the use of this equation assumes that the total amount of added ligand is far greater than the amount of ligand bound to the microtiter wells. Ligand blotting experiments were carried out as previously described (26Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, LRP or VLDLr1–8 were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) under nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 3% nonfat milk and incubated with 20 nmMMP-9·TIMP-1 for 16 h at 4 °C in TBS containing 3% nonfat milk, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20. In some experiments, 500 nm RAP was included. After three washes, the filters were incubated with an anti-MMP-9 monoclonal antibody (1.0 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 1 h at 25 °C. MMP-9 binding was visualized using the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex was labeled with [125I]iodine to a specific activity ranging from 2–10 μCi/μg of protein using Iodogen (Pierce). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (LRP(+/+)) and LRP-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA-13, LRP(−/−)) were plated onto 12-well plates at ∼1 × 105 cells/well and grown overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were then washed twice with assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Nutridoma media supplement; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1.5% BSA) and incubated in this medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with assay medium containing 5 nm125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 for the indicated times at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with assay medium and detached with 0.5 ml of trypsin/proteinase K (to dissociate LRP·125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complexes from the cell surface) and then pelletized by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 5 min). The amount of internalized 125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex was determined by measuring the radioactivity associated with the cell pellet in a γ counter. Nonspecific uptake was assessed by measuring125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 internalization in the presence of an excess amount of the LRP antagonist RAP (1 μm). Degradation was determined by measuring the radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction of the culture supernatant in a γ counter. In all experiments a control was included in which the amount of degradation products generated in the absence of cells was also measured. Previous reports demonstrated that LRP can directly bind and mediate the cellular catabolism of MMP-13 (12Barmina O.Y. Walling H.W. Fiacco G.J. Freije J.M. Lopez-Otin C. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30087-30093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and regulates levels of MMP-2 as well (13Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of LRP in the catabolism of the MMP gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, LRP(+/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in serum-free medium for increasing lengths of time in the absence or presence of RAP. RAP was first identified when it was found to co-purify with LRP (20Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Subsequent work (14Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that this molecule binds tightly to LRP and prevents binding of all known ligands to this receptor. In the current experiments, the conditioned media were collected and analyzed for the presence of gelatinases by gelatin zymography (Fig.1). The results indicate that LRP(+/−) cells treated with RAP contain similar amounts of 72-kDa MMP-2 when compared with parallel cultures treated with BSA. However, the RAP-treated cultures contain significantly more of the 105-kDa MMP-9 in their media than the control-treated cells. The increased levels of MMP-9 in the conditioned medium of RAP-treated cells suggest that LRP regulates the levels of MMP-9 present in cell culture media. In the current experiments, we noted that control levels of MMP-2 were high and that very little change in MMP-2 levels occurred when the cells were cultured in the presence of RAP, whereas in another study using mouse dermal fibroblasts, an increase in MMP-2 levels in the presence of RAP was noted (13Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As this accumulation did not occur in dermal fibroblasts isolated from mice in which the TSP2 gene was deleted, we previously concluded that MMP-2 catabolism by LRP is mediated by TSP2. Indeed the embryonic fibroblasts used in the current study produce barely detectable levels of TSP2, as determined by immunoblot of conditioned media. 2Z. Yang and P. Bornstein, unpublished observation. To investigate the mechanism by which LRP modulates MMP-9 levels, we initiated experiments to determine if MMP-9 can directly bind to LRP. The preparation of MMP-9 used in the current experiments was composed of MMP-9 in complex with its cognate inhibitor TIMP-1. Our initial experiments examined the interaction of the MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex with LRP by ligand-blotting experiments. Purified human LRP and a soluble VLDLr fragment containing the ligand binding region of this receptor (VLDLr1–8) were first subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then incubated with 20 nm recombinant human MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex. The binding of MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex to LRP was then visualized using an anti-MMP-9 IgG. The results demonstrate that MMP-9·TIMP-1 binds to LRP (Fig.2 A) but not to VLDLr1–8 (Fig.2 B). The binding to LRP was blocked when excess RAP was incubated along with MMP-9, confirming the specificity of the interaction. We next wished to ascertain if the presence of TIMP-1 is required for binding of MMP-9 to LRP. To investigate this, a “receptor blot” was performed. In this experiment, RAP (as a positive control), the MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex, and the MMP-2·TIMP-2 complex were first subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig.3, A–C) to separate MMP-9 and MMP-2 from TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, respectively. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with purified LRP, and receptor binding was visualized with an anti-LRP IgG. The results demonstrate that LRP recognized RAP (Fig. 3 B,lane 1) and TIMP-free MMP-9 (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) but not TIMP-1, MMP-2, or TIMP-2. Binding of LRP to MMP-9 was abolished by the addition of excess RAP (Fig. 3 C), confirming the specificity of the interaction. MMP-9 is known to be composed of domains stabilized by disulfide bonds, and consequently we investigated the binding of LRP to MMP-9 subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The results (Fig. 3 D, lane 2) indicate that LRP failed to bind to MMP-9 when the enzyme was subjected to reduction before SDS-PAGE. In contrast, when RAP was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, no impact on the ability of LRP to bind RAP was noted (Fig. 3 D, lane 1), consistent with the fact that RAP contains no cysteine residues. These results indicate that MMP-9 directly binds to LRP even in the absence of TIMP-1 and that reduction of MMP-9 abolishes its ability to bind LRP. To measure the affinity of LRP for MMP-9·TIMP-1 complexes, a solid phase assay was employed in which the MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex was first immobilized on microtiter wells. Increasing concentrations of LRP were then incubated with the immobilized MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex, and the extent of LRP binding was measured using the anti-LRP monoclonal antibody 8G1. An apparent KD of 0.6 nmfor the binding of LRP to MMP-9·TIMP-1 was estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of the data (Fig. 4,closed triangles). In contrast, MMP-2·TIMP-2 complexes demonstrated much lower affinity for LRP in the same assay (Fig. 4,closed circles), with an apparent KDvalue estimated to be at least 10–100-fold weaker than that of MMP-9. No binding of LRP to microtiter wells coated with BSA was observed (Fig. 4, open squares). In the same experiment, the apparent affinity of LRP for microtiter wells coated with RAP was determined to be 0.07 nm (data not shown). We also investigated the binding of MMP-9·TIMP-1 to microtiter wells coated with LRP. Increasing concentrations of MMP-9·TIMP-1 in the absence or presence of excess RAP were added to the microtiter wells, and after washing, binding was determined by using a specific antibody recognizing MMP-9. The results (Fig. 5) demonstrate that MMP-9·TIMP-1 binds to solid phase LRP with an estimated KD value of 20 nm determined by nonlinear regression analysis. The binding appeared specific for LRP, because the binding was completely inhibited when excess RAP was included in the assay. In addition, no binding of MMP-9·TIMP-1 to microtiter wells coated with BSA was observed. In the same experiment, the apparent KD for RAP binding to microtiter wells coated with LRP was determined to be 4 nm (data not shown). Together, the experiments in Figs. 4 and 5 confirm that LRP binds MMP-9 with high affinity. Curiously, we noted that the apparent affinity of LRP for MMP-9·TIMP-1 and RAP was considerably higher when these ligands were coated to microtiter wells. The reason for this discrepancy is not apparent, but we suspect that the increased affinity for RAP when this ligand is coated on microtiter wells might be due to the presence of multiple binding sites on LRP for this molecule (27Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), resulting in multivalent attachment. Therefore, LRP may also contain multiple binding sites for the MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex as well. To determine the physiological relevance of the interaction between MMP-9 and LRP, LRP(+/+) and LRP(−/−) cells were incubated with125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex for 6 h. After incubation, the extent of radioactivity associated with the cell surface (Fig.6 A) or internalized (Fig.6 B) was measured. The results indicate that the125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex associates with the cell surface and is internalized in LRP-expressing cells, and the amount of125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex associated with the cell surface or internalized was greatly reduced when the cells were incubated with excess RAP. In contrast, very little125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complexes were associated with the cell surface or internalized in cells deficient in LRP. Interestingly, a small amount of 125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 internalization was observed in LRP-deficient cells that were inhibited by RAP (Fig.6 B), suggesting that another as yet unidentified member of the LDL receptor family may also recognize the MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex. We next examined the time course of internalization and degradation of125I-MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex in LRP-expressing and LRP-deficient cells (Fig. 7). LRP-expressing cells demonstrated a time-dependent accumulation of radioactivity (Fig. 7 A), which was prevented when the cells were incubated with excess RAP. In contrast, LRP-deficient cells only internalized small amounts of125I-labeled MMP-9·TIMP-1 complexes (Fig. 7 B). LRP-mediated internalization of 125I-labeled MMP-9·TIMP-1 complexes was associated with their cellular-mediated degradation (Fig.7 C), as confirmed by blocking with chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases. Virtually all of the cellular-mediated degradation was blocked by RAP, and no degradation was detected in cell lines deficient in LRP (Fig. 7 D). These data confirm that LRP mediates the cellular uptake of MMP-9·TIMP-1 complexes, leading to their degradation. In the current investigation, we have demonstrated that murine fibroblasts cultured in the presence of RAP accumulate MMP-9 in their media, indicating that a RAP-sensitive receptor contributes to the catabolism of this molecule. In vitro binding studies and cellular uptake experiments confirm that this receptor is LRP. These studies established that LRP binds MMP-9 specifically and with high affinity. MMP-9 is secreted as a complex with its specific inhibitor, TIMP-1, and both the MMP-9·TIMP-1 complex and free MMP-9 bind to LRP, suggesting that a LRP binding determinant is primarily located within the MMP-9 molecule. A role for LRP in mediating the cellular catabolism of MMP-9 was confirmed by demonstrating that murine fibroblasts lacking LRP are inefficient in mediating the cellular internalization and degradation of MMP-9. Together, these data confirm that LRP is a cellular receptor for MMP-9 and functions to regulate the levels of MMP-9. LRP is a member of the LDL receptor family of endocytic receptors that also includes the LDL receptor, the VLDL receptor, apoE receptor 2, gp330/megalin, and LRP-1b. Deletion of the LRP gene in mice revealed an essential but undefined role for this receptor during development (28Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The biological activity of LRP was initially characterized as a clearance receptor for chylomicron remnants (29Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G. Herz J. Stanley K.K. Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and complexes of α2-macroglobulin with proteinases (22Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work has revealed that this receptor recognizes several classes of ligands, including serine proteinases (30Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15993-15999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ability of LRP to bind MMP-9 now reveals that this receptor plays a major role in regulating levels of certain MMP family members as well. Barminaet al. (12Barmina O.Y. Walling H.W. Fiacco G.J.

Yanget al. (35Yang Z. Kyriakides T.R. Bornstein P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) found an adhesive defect in dermal fibroblasts derived from TSP2-null mice that results from accumulation of MMP-2 in the cell media. Anti-LRP IgG and RAP both inhibited adhesion and increased MMP-2 levels in conditioned media from wild type, but not TSP2-null cells, confirming that LRP is also involved in catabolism of MMP-2 as well (13Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Since the clearance of MMP-2 was shown to be TSP2-dependent, it was suggested that clearance of MMP-2·TSP2 complexes by LRP is an important mechanism for the regulation of MMP-2 levels (13Yang Z. Strickland D.K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8403-8408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The ability of LRP to modulate three MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-13, and MMP-9) indicates a major role for this receptor in removing excessive extracellular proteolytic activity. In the case of MMP-9, tight regulation of its activity and levels are likely to be important, since this MMP has important biological properties.

These in vivo models indicate that MMP-9 may function to proteolyze the extracellular matrix, resulting in the release of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which are normally thought to be sequestered in this matrix. Additionally, MMP-9 may also function to activate transforming growth factor β (38Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these molecules are able to promote angiogenesis and tumor progression. Curiously, LRP levels and activity are known to be substantially decreased in tumors (39De Vries T.J. Verheijen J.H.

Res. 1994; 6: 365-372PubMed Google Scholar), which would decrease catabolism of MMP-9, leading to higher levels of this enzyme at the tumor site. Of interest in this regard, Kancha et al.(40Kancha R.K. Stearns M.E. Hussain M.M. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 365-372PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the expression of LRP in invasive and noninvasive subclones derived from tumor cells. They observed a 2–3-fold decrease in LRP activity in invasive subclones compared with noninvasive subclones derived from human prostate PC-3 and DU 145 and melanoma A2058 cells. This study suggested a correlation between invasive phenotype and low LRP expression in different tumor cells. LRP is known to regulate the levels of another proteinase system involving urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its cellular receptor, the uPA receptor. The ability of LRP to modulate uPA receptor levels (41Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and uPA activity (42Zhang J.C. Sakthivel R. Kniss D. Graham C.H. Strickland D.K. McCrae K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32273-32280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) has been offered as a mechanistic explanation to account for the role that LRP plays in cellular migration and invasion. For example, in human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells, both RAP (43Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 44Wijnberg M.J. Quax P.H. Nieuwenbroek N.M. Verheijen J.H. Thromb.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) significantly inhibit their migration. In a different model employing mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Weaver et al. (41Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) observed that LRP-deficient cells migrated nearly twice as rapidly as the LRP-expressing cells. The migration difference was only noted on culture wells that were pre-coated with serum or vitronectin but not in wells coated with type I collagen or Matrigel. In this study, the contribution of LRP to cellular migration was attributed to its effect on the activity of the uPA/uPA receptor system (41Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In light of the findings of the current study that LRP is a receptor for MMP-9 and therefore capable of regulating its extracellular levels, it will be important to reevaluate the mechanism by which LRP impacts cellular migration and invasion. In summary, the studies presented in this manuscript demonstrate that LRP is a functional receptor for MMP-9 and confirm that LRP is capable of mediating the cellular uptake of at least three MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-13, and MMP-9). These findings implicate a major role for LRP in modulating excessive extracellular proteinase activity and, by doing so, in regulating remodeling of the extracellular matrix. An investigation of the implications of these interactions in vivo is ongoing."

Traditionally, ROS such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical have been viewed within the context of inflammation. More recently, however, it has become clear that ROS may mediate specific cellular functions such as the response to growth factors (1Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar), hypertrophy (2Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3264-3265PubMed Google Scholar), and apoptosis (3Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Since blood vessels from atherosclerotic animals exhibit an increased flux of ROS (4Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2546-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar), understanding the cellular signals elicited by ROS should provide insight into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.Among the cellular signals subject to regulation by ROS in the vascular wall, members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are perhaps the best characterized. Three major subfamilies of MAP kinases have been described, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinase (5Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The ERKs are typically involved in the response to growth factors (i.e. proliferation, hypertrophy, and differentiation) and are activated in response to ROS such as superoxide (6Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and hydrogen peroxide (7Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The JNKs and p38 kinases are primarily involved in the cellular stress responses (5Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and are activated by hydrogen peroxide in smooth muscle cells (8Zhang J. Jin N. Liu Y. Rhoades R.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in a number of phenomena associated with cardiovascular disease. For example, dual activation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase is required for the hypertrophic response to angiotensin II in smooth muscle cells (9Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Cytokine stimulation of fibroblasts results in activation of both p38 kinase and ERK1/2, either of which is sufficient for up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 activity (10Brauchle M. Gluck D. Di Padova F. Han J. Gram H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Dual localization of p53 and activated JNK in smooth muscle cells within apoptotic regions of atherosclerotic plaque suggests that JNK activation may contribute to plaque rupture (11Metzler B. Hu Y. Dietrich H. Xu Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1875-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, MAP kinase activation in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts is associated with pathologic changes in the arterial wall.In contrast to fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, ROS-mediated activation of MAP kinases in endothelial cells is less well characterized. Treatment of endothelial cells with hydrogen peroxide is associated with activation of ERK1/2 (12Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and p38 kinase (13Huot J. Houle F. Marceau F. Landry J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar); however, the effect on JNK is unclear. Since JNK activation has been observed in other cells in response to ROS (7Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), we sought to define the effect of ROS on endothelial cell JNK activity and to identify the signaling pathways involved.DISCUSSIONThe principal finding of this study is that H2O2 activates JNK in endothelial cells through Src-dependent EGF receptor transactivation. We found that nontoxic concentrations of H2O2 rapidly activate the JNK pathway in endothelial cells, leading to c-Jun phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor, AP-1. Endothelial cell JNK activation by H2O2involved tyrosine kinase activity but not protein kinase C or phosphoinositide 3-kinase. The specific tyrosine kinase(s) involved in H2O2-mediated JNK activation were Src and the EGF receptor. Moreover, we found that H2O2-induced EGF receptor activation in endothelial cells was dependent upon Src and could be inhibited by AG1478 at concentrations of ≥10 μm. Taken together, these data are consistent with Src as an upstream signal for EGF receptor activation in response to H2O2.The activation of JNK by H2O2 has been observed in a number of cell types and transformed cell lines (7Guyton K.Z.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, little is known about oxidative stress-induced JNK activation in endothelial cells. Leptin binding to HUVECs is associated with ROS production and activation of the JNK pathway (26Bouloumie A. Marumo T. Lafontan M. Busse R. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Laminar shear stress on endothelial cells is associated with peroxynitrite-dependent activation of JNK (20Go Y.M. Park H. Maland M.C. Darley-Usmar V.M. Stoyanov B. Wetzker R. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1898-H1904PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither of these studies provided insight into the mechanisms of JNK activation. The data presented here extend these previous studies to H2O2-induced JNK activation in endothelial cells. The precise role of the JNK pathway in modulating the endothelial cell phenotype in vascular disease is not completely clear. Overexpression of c-Jun in cultured endothelial cells results in apoptosis (27Wang N. Verna L. Hardy S. Zhu Y. Ma K.S. Birrer M.J. Stemerman M.B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and human atherosclerotic plaques contain apoptotic endothelial cells (28Tricot O. Mallat Z. Heymes C. Belmin J. Leseche G. Tedgui A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2450-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although the functional consequences of JNK activation have thus far focused on cell death and apoptosis (29Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that JNK may play some role in nonlethal phenotypic changes in the endothelial cell.Activation of the JNK group of MAP kinases by cytokines has been examined in some detail. Tumor necrosis factor binding to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 induces receptor aggregation and recruitment of TRADD (tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 death domain protein) and TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2) (30Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK by TRAF2 may be mediated by either MAP kinase kinase 4 or 7 through pathways that may involve MAP kinase/ERK kinase 1 or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (reviewed in Ref. 31Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast to cytokines, the upstream signals linking environmental stress to JNK activation are less well characterized. In the present study, we found that H2O2-induced JNK activation was dependent upon Src. This finding is in keeping with observations that Src tyrosine kinases are activated by oxidative events (32Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 33Nakamura K. Hori T. Sato N. Sugie K. Kawakami T. Yodoi J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22892-22898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Yoshizumi et al.(36Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that H2O2-mediated JNK activation in fibroblasts is dependent upon Src and Cas. The data presented here extend these findings to involve the EGF receptor in Src-dependent signaling. The precise role of Cas in this scheme vis-à-vis the EGF receptor will require further investigation.Previous studies in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts indicated that H2O2-induced JNK activation involved Src, whereas activation of ERK1/2 and p38 did not (36Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast, mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells treated with H2O2 exhibit EGF receptor activation that is manifest as stimulation of ERK1/2 (37Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Jeong S.J. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that endothelial cells respond to H2O2 in a manner similar to the mucoepidermoid cells in that H2O2-induced ERK1/2 stimulation was significantly inhibited by both PP2 and AG1478, implicating both Src and EGF in this process. The mechanism(s) responsible for this distinct pattern of responses between endothelial and smooth muscle cells is not clear but certainly warrants further investigation.A novel aspect of this work is the involvement of the EGF receptor in H2O2-induced JNK activation. We found that H2O2-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 and down-regulation of the EGF receptor by antisense oligonucleotides. Although EGF has been shown previously to activate the JNK pathway (35Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), our results indicate that H2O2 activates the EGF receptor via a mechanism that is distinct from EGF receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 8) and requires Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7). Such ligand-independent “transactivation” of the EGF receptor has been described with respect to a number of diverse stimuli including G-protein-coupled receptors, cytokines, and cellular stress (38Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The data presented here are in agreement with one other report of H2O2-induced EGF receptor transactivation (37Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Jeong S.J. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In that study, EGF receptor transactivation by peroxide was found to mediate ERK1/2-dependent mucin synthesis in NCI-H292 cells, a mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line. However, there was no attempt in that study to investigate the effect of H2O2 on nonreceptor tyrosine kinases or the JNK family of MAP kinases.The precise mechanism of H2O2-induced EGF receptor transactivation is not clear, although receptor modification by H2O2 has been observed. Gamou and Shimizu (39Gamou S. Shimizu N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) found that H2O2 induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in both intact cells and isolated membranes with the major site of phosphorylation being Tyr1173. In contrast, EGF induced both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation in its receptor, resulting in quantitatively twice the phosphorylation as that observed with H2O2 (39Gamou S. Shimizu N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Goldkorn et al. (40Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) also observed that H2O2preferentially induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and this effect was inhibited by genistein, implicating a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase. Our data extend these findings and indicate that H2O2-induced EGF tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by Src (Fig. 8 C) but does not appear to involve Tyr1173 under our experimental conditions. This contention is not without precedent, since Src has been shown to mediate phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at tyrosine residues 845 and 1101, the former residue being critical for EGF-mediated stimulation of DNA synthesis (41Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These two Src phosphorylation sites are not among the autophosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus of the protein (41Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), consistent with the results presented here (Fig. 8). With this in mind, if H2O2-induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation were exclusively mediated by Src, one would not expect AG1478 to inhibit H2O2-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation as reported here (Fig. 7 C). It is worth noting that AG1478 was only effective against H2O2-induced responses at a concentration 50-fold higher than required to inhibit EGF-mediated receptor activation (Fig. 8 C). As yet undescribed actions of AG 1478 against Src kinase activity or EGFR-Src complex formation merit consideration as potential explanations for these observations.The nature of Src stimulation by oxidative stress is not known. In this study, we used H2O2, a two-electron oxidant, as our source of oxidative stress. Once formed, H2O2 participates in two major oxidation reactions relevant to biologic systems. In the first of these reactions, H2O2 may oxidize sulfur atoms to the corresponding sulfoxide via SN2 reaction of the sulfur with the O–O bond of H2O2 (42Pryor W.A. Frei B. Natural Antioxidants in Human Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 1-19Google Scholar). If the sulfur atom is reduced, H2O2 can oxidize the thiols to the corresponding disulfide or sulfenic acid (42Pryor W.A. Frei B. Natural Antioxidants in Human Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 1-19Google Scholar). This latter activity may be particularly germane to the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases such as Src. There is a growing appreciation that protein-tyrosine kinases are under a tonic inhibition by protein tyrosine phosphatases that typically contain thiol groups critical to their activity. Moreover, H2O2 has been shown to reversibly inactivate protein tyrosine phosphatases both in vitro (43Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 44Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32554-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and in cells (45Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) by virtue of thiol oxidation. Based upon these reports, it is attractive to speculate that H2O2 signaling is mediated through the inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, and such speculation could easily apply to Src family kinases. However, since all protein phosphatases share a similar active site motif consisting of a cysteine and an arginine separated by five residues (CXXXXXR), it is difficult to understand why H2O2demonstrates relative signal specificity in many systems. It is also not clear if other single-electron (e.g. superoxide, lipid peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl) or two-electron (e.g.peroxynitrite, hypochlorous acid) oxidants will produce similar or diverse patterns of signal transduction.In summary, the data presented here indicate that H2O2 readily induces JNK activation in endothelial cells. This H2O2-mediated JNK activation involves both Src family kinases and transactivation of the EGF receptor. Given the emerging importance of EGF receptor transactivation in a number of heterologous signaling systems, this may represent a new pathway for JNK activation in the setting of oxidative stress. Abundant evidence indicates that cardiovascular disease is characterized by a state of excess oxidative stress and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 within the arterial wall. Traditionally, ROS such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical have been viewed within the context of inflammation. More recently, however, it has become clear that ROS may mediate specific cellular functions such as the response to growth factors (1Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 3264-3265PubMed Google Scholar), and apoptosis (3Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11848-11852Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Since blood vessels from atherosclerotic animals exhibit an increased flux of ROS (4Ohara Y. Peterson T.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2546-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar), understanding the cellular signals elicited by ROS should provide insight into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Among the cellular signals subject to regulation by ROS in the vascular wall, members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are perhaps the best characterized. Three major subfamilies of MAP kinases have been described, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinase (5Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The ERKs are typically involved in the response to growth factors (i.e. proliferation, hypertrophy, and differentiation) and are activated in response to ROS such as superoxide (6Baas A.S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and hydrogen peroxide (7Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The JNKs and p38 kinases are primarily involved in the cellular stress responses (5Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and are activated by hydrogen peroxide in smooth muscle cells (8Zhang J. Jin N. Liu Y. Rhoades R.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in a number of phenomena associated with cardiovascular disease. For example, dual activation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase is required for the hypertrophic response to angiotensin II in smooth muscle cells (9Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Cytokine stimulation of fibroblasts results in activation of both p38 kinase and ERK1/2, either of which is sufficient for up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 activity (10Brauchle M. Gluck D. Di Padova F. Han J. Gram H. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Dual localization of p53 and activated JNK in smooth muscle cells within apoptotic regions of atherosclerotic plaque suggests that JNK activation may contribute to plaque rupture (11Metzler B. Hu Y. Dietrich H. Xu Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1875-1886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, MAP kinase activation in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts is associated with pathologic changes in the arterial wall. In contrast to fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, ROS-mediated activation of MAP kinases in endothelial cells is less well characterized. Treatment of endothelial cells with hydrogen peroxide is associated with activation of ERK1/2 (12Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and p38 kinase (13Huot J. Houle F. Marceau F. Landry J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar); however, the effect on JNK is unclear. Since JNK activation has been observed in other cells in response to ROS (7Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), we sought to define the effect of ROS on endothelial cell JNK activity and to identify the signaling pathways involved. DISCUSSIONThe principal finding of this study is that H2O2 activates JNK in endothelial cells through Src-dependent EGF receptor transactivation. We found that nontoxic concentrations of H2O2 rapidly activate the JNK pathway in endothelial cells, leading to c-Jun phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor, AP-1. Endothelial cell JNK activation by H2O2involved tyrosine kinase activity but not protein kinase C or phosphoinositide 3-kinase. The specific tyrosine kinase(s) involved in H2O2-mediated JNK activation were Src and the EGF receptor. Moreover, we found that H2O2-induced EGF receptor activation in endothelial cells was dependent upon Src and could be inhibited by AG1478 at concentrations of ≥10 μm. Taken together, these data are consistent with Src as an upstream signal for EGF receptor activation in response to H2O2.The activation of JNK by H2O2 has been observed in a number of cell types and transformed cell lines (7Guyton K.Z.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, little is known about oxidative stress-induced JNK activation in endothelial cells. Leptin binding to HUVECs is associated with ROS production and activation of the JNK pathway (26Bouloumie A. Marumo T. Lafontan M. Busse R. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Laminar shear stress on endothelial cells is associated with peroxynitrite-dependent activation of JNK (20Go Y.M. Park H. Maland M.C. Darley-Usmar V.M. Stoyanov B. Wetzker R. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1898-H1904PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither of these studies provided insight into the mechanisms of JNK activation. The data presented here extend these previous studies to H2O2-induced JNK activation in endothelial cells. The precise role of the JNK pathway in modulating the endothelial cell phenotype in vascular disease is not completely clear. Overexpression of c-Jun in cultured endothelial cells results in apoptosis (27Wang N. Verna L. Hardy S. Zhu Y. Ma K.S. Birrer M.J. Stemerman M.B. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and human atherosclerotic plaques contain apoptotic endothelial cells (28Tricot O. Mallat Z. Heymes C. Belmin J. Leseche G. Tedgui A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2450-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although the functional consequences of JNK activation have thus far focused on cell death and apoptosis (29Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), it is reasonable to speculate that JNK may play some role in nonlethal phenotypic changes in the endothelial cell.Activation of the JNK group of MAP kinases by cytokines has been examined in some detail. Tumor necrosis factor binding to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 induces receptor aggregation and recruitment of TRADD (tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 death domain protein) and TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2) (30Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK by TRAF2 may be mediated by either MAP kinase kinase 4 or 7 through pathways that may involve MAP kinase/ERK kinase 1 or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (reviewed in Ref. 31Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast to cytokines, the upstream signals linking environmental stress to JNK activation are less well characterized. In the present study, we found that H2O2-induced JNK activation was dependent upon Src. This finding is in keeping with observations that Src tyrosine kinases are activated by oxidative events (32Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 33Nakamura K. Hori T. Sato N. Sugie K. Kawakami T. Yodoi J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that H2O2-mediated JNK activation in fibroblasts is dependent upon Src and Cas. The data presented here extend these findings to involve the EGF receptor in Src-dependent signaling. The precise role of Cas in this scheme vis-à-vis the EGF receptor will require further investigation.Previous studies in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts indicated that H2O2-induced JNK activation involved Src, whereas activation of ERK1/2 and p38 did not (36Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast, mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells treated with H2O2 exhibit EGF receptor activation that is manifest as stimulation of ERK1/2 (37Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Jeong S.J. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that endothelial cells respond to H2O2 in a manner similar to the mucoepidermoid cells in that H2O2-induced ERK1/2 stimulation was significantly inhibited by both PP2 and AG1478, implicating both Src and EGF in this process. The mechanism(s) responsible for this distinct pattern of responses between endothelial and smooth muscle cells is not clear but certainly warrants further investigation.A novel aspect of this work is the involvement of the EGF receptor in H2O2-induced JNK activation. We found that H2O2-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 and down-regulation of the EGF receptor by antisense oligonucleotides. Although EGF has been shown previously to activate the JNK pathway (35Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), our results indicate that H2O2 activates the EGF receptor via a mechanism that is distinct from EGF receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 8) and requires Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7). Such ligand-independent “transactivation” of the EGF receptor has been described with respect to a number of diverse stimuli including G-protein-coupled receptors, cytokines, and cellular stress (38Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The data presented here are in agreement with one other report of H2O2-induced EGF receptor transactivation (37Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Jeong S.J. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In that study, EGF receptor transactivation by peroxide was found to mediate ERK1/2-dependent mucin synthesis in NCI-H292 cells, a mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line. However, there was no attempt in that study to investigate the effect of H2O2 on nonreceptor tyrosine kinases or the JNK family of MAP kinases.The precise mechanism of H2O2-induced EGF receptor transactivation is not clear, although receptor modification by H2O2 has been observed. Gamou and Shimizu (39Gamou S. Shimizu N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) found that H2O2 induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in both intact cells and isolated membranes with the major site of phosphorylation being Tyr1173. In contrast, EGF induced both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation in its receptor, resulting in quantitatively twice the phosphorylation as that observed with H2O2 (39Gamou S. Shimizu N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Goldkorn et al. (40Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Matsukuma K. Chea V. Gould R. Last J. Chan C. Chavez C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) also observed that H2O2preferentially induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and this effect was inhibited by genistein, implicating a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase. Our data extend these findings and indicate that H2O2-induced EGF tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by Src (Fig. 8 C) but does not appear to involve Tyr1173 under our experimental conditions. This contention is not without precedent, since Src has been shown to mediate phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at tyrosine residues 845 and 1101, the former residue being critical for EGF-mediated stimulation of DNA synthesis (41Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These two Src phosphorylation sites are not among the autophosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus of the protein (41Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), consistent with the results presented here (Fig. 8). With this in mind, if H2O2-induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation were exclusively mediated by Src, one would not expect AG1478 to inhibit H2O2-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation as reported here (Fig. 7 C). It is worth noting that AG1478 was only effective against H2O2-induced responses at a concentration 50-fold higher than required to inhibit EGF-mediated receptor activation (Fig. 8 C). As yet undescribed actions of AG 1478 against Src kinase activity or EGFR-Src complex formation merit consideration as potential explanations for these observations.The nature of Src stimulation by oxidative stress is not known. In this study, we used H2O2, a two-electron oxidant, as our source of oxidative stress. Once formed, H2O2 participates in two major oxidation reactions relevant to biologic systems. In the first of these reactions, H2O2 may oxidize sulfur atoms to the corresponding sulfoxide via SN2 reaction of the sulfur with the O–O bond of H2O2 (42Pryor W.A. Frei B. Natural Antioxidants in Human Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 1-19Google Scholar). If the sulfur atom is reduced, H2O2 can oxidize the thiols to the corresponding disulfide or sulfenic acid (42Pryor W.A. Frei B. Natural Antioxidants in Human Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 1-19Google Scholar). This latter activity may be particularly germane to the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases such as Src. There is a growing appreciation that protein-tyrosine kinases are under a tonic inhibition by protein tyrosine phosphatases that typically contain thiol groups critical to their activity. Moreover, H2O2 has been shown to reversibly inactivate protein tyrosine phosphatases both in vitro (43Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 44Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32554-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and in cells (45Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) by virtue of thiol oxidation. Based upon these reports, it is attractive to speculate that H2O2 signaling is mediated through the inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, and such speculation could easily apply to Src family kinases. However, since all protein phosphatases share a similar active site motif consisting of a cysteine and an arginine separated by five residues (CXXXXXR), it is difficult to understand why H2O2demonstrates relative signal specificity in many systems. It is also not clear if other single-electron (e.g. superoxide, lipid peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl) or two-electron (e.g.peroxynitrite, hypochlorous acid) oxidants will produce similar or diverse patterns of signal transduction.In summary, the data presented here indicate that H2O2 readily induces JNK activation in endothelial cells. This H2O2-mediated JNK activation involves both Src family kinases and transactivation of the EGF receptor. Given the emerging importance of EGF receptor transactivation in a number of heterologous signaling systems, this may represent a new pathway for JNK activation in the setting of oxidative stress. The principal finding of this study is that H2O2 activates JNK in endothelial cells through Src-dependent EGF receptor transactivation. We found that nontoxic concentrations of H2O2 rapidly activate the JNK pathway in endothelial cells, leading to c-Jun phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor, AP-1.

Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These two Src phosphorylation sites are not among the autophosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus of the protein (41Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), consistent with the results presented here (Fig. 8). With this in mind, if H2O2-induced EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation were exclusively mediated by Src, one would not expect AG1478 to inhibit H2O2-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation as reported here (Fig. 7 C). It is worth noting that AG1478 was only effective against H2O2-induced responses at a concentration 50-fold higher than required to inhibit EGF-mediated receptor activation (Fig. 8 C). As yet undescribed actions of AG 1478 against Src kinase activity or EGFR-Src complex formation merit consideration as potential explanations for these observations. The nature of Src stimulation by oxidative stress is not known. In this study, we used H2O2, a two-electron oxidant, as our source of oxidative stress. Once formed, H2O2 participates in two major oxidation reactions relevant to biologic systems. In the first of these reactions, H2O2 may oxidize sulfur atoms to the corresponding sulfoxide via SN2 reaction of the sulfur with the O–O bond of H2O2 (42Pryor W.A. Frei B. Natural Antioxidants in Human Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 1-19Google Scholar). If the sulfur atom is reduced, H2O2 can oxidize the thiols to the corresponding disulfide or sulfenic acid (42Pryor W.A. Frei B. Natural Antioxidants in Human Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 1-19Google Scholar). This latter activity may be particularly germane to the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases such as Src. There is a growing appreciation that protein-tyrosine kinases are under a tonic inhibition by protein tyrosine phosphatases that typically contain thiol groups critical to their activity. Moreover, H2O2 has been shown to reversibly inactivate protein tyrosine phosphatases both in vitro (43Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 44Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32554-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and in cells (45Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) by virtue of thiol oxidation. Based upon these reports, it is attractive to speculate that H2O2 signaling is mediated through the inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, and such speculation could easily apply to Src family kinases. However, since all protein phosphatases share a similar active site motif consisting of a cysteine and an arginine separated by five residues (CXXXXXR), it is difficult to understand why H2O2demonstrates relative signal specificity in many systems. It is also not clear if other single-electron (e.g. superoxide, lipid peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl) or two-electron (e.g.peroxynitrite, hypochlorous acid) oxidants will produce similar or diverse patterns of signal transduction. In summary, the data presented here indicate that H2O2 readily induces JNK activation in endothelial cells. This H2O2-mediated JNK activation involves both Src family kinases and transactivation of the EGF receptor. Given the emerging importance of EGF receptor transactivation in a number of heterologous signaling systems, this may represent a new pathway for JNK activation in the setting of oxidative stress."

Fifteen novel peptides, named ponericins, exhibiting antibacterial and insecticidal properties were purified, and their amino acid sequences were characterized. According to their primary structure similarities, they can be classified into three families: ponericin G, W, and L. Ponericins share high sequence similarities with known peptides: ponericins G with cecropin-like peptides, ponericins W with gaegurins and melittin, and ponericins L with dermaseptins. Ten peptides were synthesized for further analysis. Their antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains were analyzed together with their insecticidal activities against cricket larvae and their hemolytic activities. Interestingly, within each of the three families, several peptides present differences in their biological activities. The comparison of the structural features of ponericins with those of well-studied peptides suggests that the ponericins may adopt an amphipathic α-helical structure in polar environments, such as cell membranes.

For example, bee propolis and royal jelly present antimicrobial properties (1Fujiwara S. Imai J. Fujiwara M. Yaeshima T. Kawashima T. Kobayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11333-11337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fernandes A. Lopes C.A.M. Sforcin J.M. Funari S.R.C. J. Venom. Anim.

Ecol. 1998; 24: 1697-1706Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Within ants, most species possess metapleural glands on the thorax whose secretions, spread over the ants and throughout the nest, have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial action (4Hölldobler B. Engel-Siegel H. Psyche. 1984; 91: 201-224Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Maschwitz U. Koob K. Schildknecht H. J.

The mandibular gland secretions of some army ant species also have a dual defensive role against both predators and microbial attacks of brood (8Brown C.A. Watkins J.F. Eldridge D.W. J. Kansas Entomol. Soc. 1979; 52: 119-122Google Scholar). If these mechanisms control the proliferation of many bacteria and fungi in the nesting environment, the introduction of pathogens may also arise from alimentation, especially prey. Among ants, predators stricto sensu are overrepresented within the subfamily Ponerinae (9Hölldobler B. Wilson E.O. The Ants. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). Most of these species capture almost every encountered prey using their venom (10Orivel J. Souchal A. Cerdan P. Dejean A. Sociobiology. 2000; 35: 131-140Google Scholar), which contains peptides (and proteins) (9Hölldobler B. Wilson E.O. The Ants. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar, 11Blum M.S.

Venoms of the Hymenoptera: Biochemical, Pharmacological and Behavioural Aspects. Academic Press, London1986: 425-508Crossref Google Scholar). Because these prey are then brought back to the nest immediately after immobilization, their potential infection by bacteria, fungi, or viruses may seriously affect the survival of ant colonies or induce extensive damages because of the high population density combined with the close genetic relationship of the individuals. The antibacterial property of ant venom has only been demonstrated in the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, in whose venom alkaloids inhibit the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and presumably act as a brood antibiotic (12Schmidt J.O.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 2: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Venoms of the wasp,Vespa crabro, honey bees, and various snakes contain antimicrobial peptides, but their functions have not been investigated (14Oren Z. Shai Y.

Finally, lycotoxins isolated from spider venom are the only antimicrobial peptides in venom for which a preventive role against infections arising from prey ingestion has been demonstrated (18Yan L. Adams M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2059-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the possible role of the venom of a predatory ant species in the prevention of microbial disease. The antimicrobial, insecticidal, and hemolytic properties of the venom of the arboreal ponerine ant, Pachycondyla goeldii, were studied. In total, 15 novel peptides, named ponericins, were purified, and their primary structures were fully characterized through amino acid sequencing and matrix-assisted laser ionization/desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses. According to their amino acid sequences, ponericins were classified into three families named ponericin G, W, and L. Ten peptides were synthesized to perform detailed analyses of their biological activities. The relationships of these peptides with known antimicrobial peptides are discussed. Whole venom reservoirs were dissected from P. goeldiiants collected in Petit Saut, French Guiana. After rinsing in water, they were stored at −20 °C until processed. The venom reservoirs were disrupted by ultrasonic waves in a 30% acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid solution (10 μl/venom reservoir), and empty reservoirs and membranes were discarded by centrifugation. Whole venom was injected into a C18 reversed-phase column (5 μm, particle size; 220 × 2.1-mm column; Vydac), and separations were performed at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Peptide elution was monitored at 215 nm. Collected fractions were vacuum-dried and tested for biological activity. First, the venom was separated into four fractions with a gradient consisting of 10–80% solvent B (80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 60 min. Solvent A was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Second, the venom was further purified on the same column with a biphasic gradient of 10–25% solvent B for 10 min and 25–55% solvent B for 75 min to improve the separation of the peptides contained in the active fraction. The purified peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser ionization/desorption time-of-flight (Voyager Elite; PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) mass spectrometry as described by Seon et al. (19Seon A.A. Pierre T.N. Redeker V. Lacombe C. Delfour A. Nicolas P. Amiche M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5934-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Peptides were sequenced by automated Edman degradation using a Procise pulse-liquid protein sequencer (model 494; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). About 30–60 pmol of peptide were dried and solubilized in 10 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.5. Carboxyl-terminal sequences were determined by digestion with carboxypeptidase Y and mass spectrometry analysis of the digestion products as described by Seon et al. (19Seon A.A. Pierre T.N. Redeker V. Lacombe C. Delfour A. Nicolas P. Amiche M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5934-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ten peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by Synt:em (Nimes, France). Peptides G1, G3, G4, G6, W1, W4, W5, W6, and L2 were identical to the isolated ponericins. Due to some problems, ponericin W3 was synthesized in a modified form compared with the natural peptide. The corresponding synthetic peptide was called W3-desK and presented 3 lysine residues at the carboxyl-terminal region, therefore having one lysine residue less than the natural W3 (i.e. —LKKKQ for W3-desK instead of —LKKKKQ for W3). Because W1 and W5 peptides present the same difference in their carboxyl-terminal sequence (i.e. —FKKKKQ for W1 and —FKKKQ for W5) together with other small differences (addition or deletion) but have similar activity spectra (Table I), the W3-desK peptide was further analyzed to obtain an idea of the biological activity of W3, despite their minor difference in the carboxyl terminus.Table

Open table in a new tab For each peptide, the tested concentration was 0.4–0.5 mm, and the values correspond to the diameters (in mm) of the zone of inhibition. Crude venom and an aliquot of each HPLC fraction were tested for their antibacterial activity against one Gram-negative strain (Escherichia coli RL65) and one Gram-positive strain (Staphylococcus aureus 209P). Inhibitory activity was determined by the agar-well diffusion method. Wells 6 mm in diameter were filled with 10 μl of the sample solution. After 24 h at 37 °C, inhibition zone diameters were measured by subtracting the well diameter. Synthetic peptides were tested against a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbial strains, the yeast and fungi indicated in Table I. Inhibitory activity was determined by the agar-well diffusion method. A 12-ml sample of nutrient broth containing 1.2% agar (bacteriological agar; Biokar) and supplemented with 1 ml/liter Tween 80 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was inoculated with a fresh overnight culture of the indicator strain (absorbance at 660 nm = 0.01) and poured into Petri dishes. Wells 5 mm in diameter were filled with 20 μl of the sample solution. These plates were placed overnight at 4 °C to allow the diffusion of the inhibitory agent and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C or 37 °C, depending on the indicator strain. Antifungal activity was also assessed by the agar-well diffusion assay. The fungal colonies were inoculated into the agar close to a well filled with the sample solution, and any deviation from circular growth of the fungal colonies after 24 h of incubation was scored as fungal inhibition. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the peptides (G1, G6, W1, W3-desK, and L2) was determined by liquid and plate growth inhibition assays on the bacterial strains indicated in Table II. In the plate growth inhibition assay, the MICs were determined by a critical dilution assay from an initial sample concentration of 64 μm by 2-fold dilutions in a 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Inhibitory activity determination was performed as described previously. In the liquid growth inhibition assay, 270 μl of a mid-logarithmic phase culture of bacteria were added to 30 μl of peptides. Microbial growth was assessed in microtiter plates by an increase in A620 after 24 h at 30 °C or 37 °C. The concentrations tested for each peptide were in the range of 0.125–64 μm. The MIC values are expressed as intervals between the highest concentration at which bacteria grow and the lowest concentration that causes 100% growth inhibition (20Casteels P. Ampe C. Jacobs F. Tempst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7044-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cecropin B from the moth Hyalophora cecropia, melittin from honey bee venom, and dermaseptin from the skin of the frogPhyllomedusa sauvagii (Sigma) were used as control antibiotic peptides in the plate growth inhibition assay.Table IIAntibacterial action of ponericins G1, G6, W1, W3-desK, and L2MicroorganismsMIC2-aMICs are expressed as the interval between the highest concentration tested at which the bacteria grow and the lowest that caused growth inhibition.Liquid growth inhibition assayPlate growth inhibition assayG1G6W1W3-desKL2G1G6W1W3-desKL2CecropinMelittinDermaseptinμmGram-positive bacteriaL. lactis ssp. cremoris I 116<0.1251–2<0.1251–2<0.1250.5–116–322–42–41–24–88–1616–32Listeria ivanovii LMA 942–42-bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).4–84–82–42-bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).16–32bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).S. aureus CIP 67716–32bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).2–42–42–44–8bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).4–84–816–32bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).32–64bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).Gram-negative bacteriaE. coli L−2–48–164–84–82–48–16bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).32–644–8bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).32–64K. pneumoniae CIP 82912–416–324–88–162–44–8bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).32–64bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).16–328–16bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).P. putida LMA1–2bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).4–88–1616–328–16bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).8–16bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).S. enterica CIP 8134–8bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).32–64bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).8–1616–32bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).4–8bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).bNo action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).Cecropin B, melittin, and dermaseptin were used as reference peptides in the plate growth inhibition assay.2-a MICs are expressed as the interval between the highest concentration tested at which the bacteria grow and the lowest that caused growth inhibition.2-b No action was detected at the highest concentration tested (64 μm).

A 12-ml sample of blood agar medium was supplemented with 1 ml of sheep or horse erythrocytes. Wells 5 mm in diameter were filled with 20 μl of the peptide solution and placed overnight at 4 °C to allow the diffusion of the hemolytic agent. After 24 h at room temperature, complete hemolysis and lysis zone diameters were measured. Given quantities of each synthetic peptide or a mixture of 5 μg of each of the 10 peptides was solubilized in an insect physiological saline buffer. These peptide solutions were injected into groups of 10–15 cricket larvae, Acheta domesticus(weight = 10 ± 0.5 mg), or P. goeldii workers (mean weight = 8.93 mg). Controls receiving injections of an insect saline buffer or a dried solution of acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid redissolved in a saline buffer showed no effect. The lethal dose corresponding to the mortality of 50% of the treated larvae after 24 h (LD50) was calculated by probit analysis (21Finney D.J.

The far-ultraviolet CD spectra were recorded in a CD6 spectropolarimeter (Jobin-Yvon, Longjumeau, France) using a 0.01-cm pathlength cuvette. The four synthetic peptides, ponericins G1, G6, W1, and L2, were solubilized in milliQ water with and without trifluoroethanol (TFE) at 25% at concentrations of 0.95, 0.87, 0.97, and 0.95 mg/ml, respectively. The CD spectra were acquired between 180 and 260 nm, with a 0.5 nm step, a 2-s integration time, and 2 nm constant bandpass. Each spectrum was averaged from five successive scans. The baselines (water and 25% TFE) were acquired independently under the same conditions and then subtracted from the corresponding sample spectra. The predicted secondary structure content was deduced from each spectrum using the Varselec analysis (22Manavalan P. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). An antibacterial assay of the crude venom of P. goeldii showed strong action against both Gram-positive (S. aureus 209P) and Gram-negative (E. coli RL65) bacterial strains at a 30 μg (dry weight of venom)/μl concentration. The venom was separated on a reversed-phase HPLC (Fig.1 a) into four fractions, of which only fraction C showed an antibacterial activity against the two previous strains. Further fractionation of the peptides eluted in fraction C demonstrated that 12 of the collected peaks had antibacterial properties (Fig. 1 b). The active peptides present in fraction C were first analyzed by matrix-assisted laser ionization/desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peaks containing one or two major components were further studied. In total, 15 peptides were characterized at the level of their amino acid sequences using Edman degradation. The amino acid sequence determination was also possible for peaks containing two peptides present in different quantities. For some of the analyzed peptides, carboxypeptidase Y digestions were used to identify or confirm amidation of the carboxyl-terminal amino acid. The accordance of the experimental masses with the calculated molecular masses was used as a control for each sequence determined. These peptides can be classified into three families according to their primary structures (Fig. 2). The peptides were named ponericins G, W, or L according to the first most frequent amino-terminal amino acid. Within each family, most of the peptides share a great percentage of sequence similarity with each other (up to 87%, 92%, or 96% for ponericins G, W, or L, respectively). The sequence similarities were calculated using identical residues and conservative replacements. Ponericins G6, G7, and W6 present the lowest sequence identities with the other members of the ponericin G and W families (from 17.2% to 26.7% for G6 and G7 and from 19.2% to 45.8% for W6). They were nonetheless classified in the latter families because they retained some common sequence features with the other members. To further investigate the antibacterial spectrum and insecticidal activity of each individual peptide, 10 of these 15 peptides corresponding to representative molecules from each family were synthesized as indicated under ”Materials and Methods.“ Whole venom was active against all the tested microbial strains except the two fungi (Table I). Among the 31 bacterial strains, the most sensitive Gram-positive bacteria were Bacillus stearothermophilus, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. Pseudomonas aeruginosawas the most sensitive Gram-negative bacteria. The 10 synthetic peptides exhibited four types of antibacterial action spectra at a concentration of 0.4–0.5 mm. Ponericins G1 and G3 exhibited an action highly comparable to that of crude venom and were active against all the tested bacteria and the yeast. The second group corresponds to the peptides W1, W3-desK, W4, W5, and L2. For this group, the results of the growth inhibition assay against Gram-positive bacteria were also comparable to those with crude venom, but at the tested concentration, these peptides were less active against most of the Gram-negative bacterial strains. Within this group, L2 was the only one that did not affect the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The third group of peptides (G6 and W6) was active against most of the Gram-positive strains but inactive against the Gram-negative strains, with the exception of P. aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. Finally, ponericin G4 only affected a few of the tested strains. It should be noted that all of the peptides were inactive against the fungal strains, as observed for crude venom. Synthetic peptides G1, G6, W1, W3-desK, and L2 were selected for further analyses. At least one member of each peptide family presenting a large activity spectrum was retained, except for G6, which was highly active against only a few strains. Their MICs were determined in both liquid and plate growth inhibition assays against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains highly sensitive or affected by most of the chosen peptides (Table II). In the liquid growth inhibition assay, G1, W1, and L2 had a marked activity (MIC < 8 μm) against most of the bacterial strains, whereas W3-desK and particularly G6 were less effective. In the plate growth inhibition assay, MICs were at least two times higher, highlighting the problem of peptide diffusion in a solid medium. Nevertheless, the same kind of results were observed, with a marked action of peptide G1 against most of the tested bacteria. Furthermore, the comparison of their MICs in the plate growth inhibition assay with those of cecropin, melittin, and dermaseptin used as reference peptides showed that their antimicrobial activity is comparable or even higher for ponericins. The hemolytic activity of the crude venom and the 10 synthetic peptides was tested on both horse and sheep erythrocyt"

EETs are converted to the corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in mammalian tissues, and inhibition of sEH has been proposed as a novel approach for the treatment of hypertension. We observed that sEH is present in porcine coronary endothelial cells (PCEC), and we found that low concentrations ofN,N′-dicyclohexylurea (DCU), a selective sEH inhibitor, have profound effects on EET metabolism in PCEC cultures. Treatment with 3 μm DCU reduced cellular conversion of 14,15-EET to 14,15-DHET by 3-fold after 4 h of incubation, with a concomitant increase in the formation of the novel β-oxidation products 10,11-epoxy-16:2 and 8,9-epoxy-14:1. DCU also markedly enhanced the incorporation of 14,15-EET and its metabolites into PCEC lipids. The most abundant product in DCU-treated cells was 16,17-epoxy-22:3, the elongation product of 14,15-EET. Another novel metabolite, 14,15-epoxy-20:2, was present in DCU-treated cells. DCU also caused a 4-fold increase in release of 14,15-EET when the cells were stimulated with a calcium ionophore. Furthermore, DCU decreased the conversion of [3H]11,12-EET to 11,12-DHET, increased 11,12-EET retention in PCEC lipids, and produced an accumulation of the partial β-oxidation product 7,8-epoxy-16:2 in the medium. These findings suggest that in addition to being metabolized by sEH, EETs are substrates for β-oxidation and chain elongation in endothelial cells and that there is considerable interaction among the three pathways. The modulation of EET metabolism by DCU provides novel insight into the mechanisms by which pharmacological or molecular inhibition of sEH effectively treats hypertension.

Res. 1995; 32: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). EETs are formed by endothelial cells and produce vasodilation in a number of vascular beds, including the coronary circulation (2Harder D.R. Campbell W.B. Roman R.J. J. Vasc.

This occurs through hyperpolarization of the vascular smooth muscle cells by activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels, suggesting that EETs function as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (4Campbell W.B.

Kaduce T.L. Knapp H.R. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1931-1942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a process that may contribute to the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation response (9Weintraub N.L. Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Chartterjee P. Spector A.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Incorporation of EETs into phospholipids also may play a role in their effects on cytokine-induced expression of adhesion molecules (10Node K. Huo Y. Ruan X. Yang B. Spiecker M. Ley K. Zeldin D.C. Liao J.K. Science. 1999; 285: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), Ca2+ signaling (11Mombouli J.V. Holzmann S. Kostner G.M. Graier W.F. J. Cardiovasc.

Pharmacol. 1998; 346: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although a great deal is known about the biological actions of EETs in the vasculature, relatively little is known about the biochemical pathways that mediate EET uptake and metabolism in endothelial cells. A major pathway for EET metabolism in many tissues is hydration of the epoxide group to a diol, forming the corresponding dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (DHET), a reaction mediated by an epoxide hydrolase (13Chacos N. Capdevila J. Falck J.R. Manna S. Martin-Wixtrom C. Gill S.S. Hammock B.D. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Zeldin D.C.

The two most studied forms of epoxide hydrolase and the two that have been shown to metabolize arachidonic acid epoxides in mammals are a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and a microsomal epoxide hydrolase (14Zeldin D.C.

Considerable interest has recently centered on sEH because of results suggesting that it is a potential target for the treatment of hypertension. Disruption of the sEH gene was found to lower systolic blood pressure in male mice (17Sinal C.J. Miyata M. Tohkin M. Nagata K. Bend J.R. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40504-40510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Likewise, N,N′-dicyclohexylurea (DCU), a recently discovered selective sEH inhibitor that has a Ki = 30 nm for recombinant human sEH (18Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Dowdy D. Zheng J. Greene J.F. Sanborn J.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8849-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), reduced blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (19Yu Z. Xu F. Huse L.M. Morisseau C. Draper A.J. Newman J.W. Parker C. Graham L. Engler M.M. Hammock B.D. Zeldin D.C. Kroetz D.L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Both of these studies demonstrated that the anti-hypertensive effects were associated with reduced conversion of EETs to DHETs in the kidney (17Sinal C.J. Miyata M. Tohkin M. Nagata K. Bend J.R. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40504-40510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 19Yu Z. Xu F. Huse L.M. Morisseau C. Draper A.J. Newman J.W. Parker C. Graham L. Engler M.M. Hammock B.D. Zeldin D.C. Kroetz D.L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One potential mechanism whereby inhibition of sEH could reduce blood pressure is by enhancing the amount of EET available for incorporation into endothelial phospholipids. Thus, whereas EETs were shown to be avidly taken up and incorporated into endothelial cell phospholipids, DHETs appeared to be released preferentially from the cells (8VanRollins M. Kaduce T.L. Knapp H.R. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1931-1942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with this notion, we have previously observed that 4-phenylchalcone oxide (4-PCO), a nonspecific inhibitor of epoxide hydrolases (20Guenthner T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), blocked conversion of 14,15-EET to 14,15-DHET and increased 14,15-EET incorporation in porcine coronary artery endothelial cell (PCEC) phospholipids (21Weintraub N.L. Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Chatterjee P. Spector A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2098-H2108PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, endothelium-dependent relaxation responses were augmented in coronary arteries. Taken together, these findings suggest that epoxide hydrolase inhibition might beneficially affect vascular function by enhancing the amount of EET incorporated into endothelial cells. Moreover, these reports suggest that sEH functions to enzymatically degrade EETs and thereby terminate their biological activity. On the other hand, several recent studies have challenged the view that sEH is simply a degradation pathway for EETs. For example, whereas DHETs were originally believed to be devoid of vasoactive properties (22Carroll M.A. Schwartzman M. Capdevila J. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 138: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Proctor K.G. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. Circ. Res. 1987; 60: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Pfister S.L. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H843-H852PubMed Google Scholar), more recent reports indicate that they are capable of dilating conduit coronary arteries and coronary microvessels (9Weintraub N.L. Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Chartterjee P. Spector A.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. VanRollins M. Spector A.A. Circ.

Also, DHETs are incorporated into endothelial cell phospholipids, albeit less avidly than the precursor EETs (27VanRollins M. Kaduce T.L. Fang X. Knapp H.R. Spector A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14001-14009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, porcine coronary artery smooth muscle cells were found to metabolize 11,12-DHET through a β-oxidation pathway, thereby generating a 16-carbon diol that also possessed vasodilating activity (25Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. VanRollins M. Spector A.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These reports indicate that epoxide hydrolase can, in some instances, generate biologically active EET metabolites. Moreover, the latter study raised the possibility that enzymes other than epoxide hydrolases might be capable of metabolizing EETs in vascular cells. The purpose of the present study was to delineate the pathways of EET uptake and metabolism in endothelial cells during sEH inhibition. We have identified two novel pathways of EET metabolism in endothelial cells that could have important implications regarding the mechanisms by which sEH inhibition lowers blood pressure. Moreover, elucidation of these pathways provides important new insight into the mechanisms by which cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase products may regulate vascular function. [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid ([3H]AA, 55 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) was mixed with AA (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) at a final concentration of 0.2 μCi/nmol. After removing the solvent, the fatty acid was methylated with 12% BF3 in methanol for 45 min at 50 °C. Following extraction, the AA methyl ester was incubated with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in methylene chloride for 1.5 h at 0 °C (28Falck J.R. Yadagiri P. Capdevila J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of methyl sulfide, and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min. The products were resuspended in methylene chloride and washed first with NaCl-saturated water and then water. The [3H]EET methyl esters were isolated and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a gradient that started at 65% acetonitrile, 35% water, was ramped to 85% acetonitrile, 15% water over 55 min, and then was taken to 100% acetonitrile at 60 min and held constant for 5 min. Fractions containing the purified [3H]11,12- and 14,15-EET 2The 3H is present at carbon 5,6,8,9,11,12,14, and 15. The 11,12- and 14,15- refer to the location of the epoxide group. methyl esters were hydrolyzed with 50 μl of 2 n NaOH in 500 μl of methanol at 50 °C for 1 h, and the [3H]EETs were extracted from the mixture with water-saturated ethyl acetate (28Falck J.R. Yadagiri P. Capdevila J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After drying under N2, the [3H]EETs were suspended in 95% ethanol and stored at −80 °C. Purity was checked by isocratic normal phase HPLC with a solvent consisting of 90%n-heptane and 10% of a mixture of n-heptane, isopropyl alcohol, and acetic acid (100:5:0.2, v/v/v). Only samples of >98% purity were used for the cell studies. PCEC were isolated and grown in modified Medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (9Weintraub N.L. Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Chartterjee P. Spector A.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Weintraub N.L. Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Chatterjee P. Spector A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2098-H2108PubMed Google Scholar). The cultures were maintained until confluent at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Stocks were subcultured weekly by trypsinization, and cultures were used for experiments between passages 3 and 7. Experiments were carried out with confluent monolayers using modified Medium 199 containing 0.1 μm bovine serum albumin. Prior to incubation, the radiolabeled EET or AA was mixed with the corresponding non-radiolabeled compound obtained from Cayman Chemical to obtain the substrate concentration necessary for each experiment and a specific activity of 0.1 μCi/nmol. The PCEC were incubated initially in 1 ml of medium containing either DCU dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or the same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide alone as a control. The DCU was purchased from Aldrich, and a liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis and melting point measurement verified the purity. After 45 min, the radiolabeled substrate was added and the incubation continued. The medium was removed at the end of the incubation period, and the cells were washed twice and harvested by scraping into methanol. In some studies, the initial incubation medium was removed, and after washing, the cells were incubated for an additional 20 min in 1 ml of fresh medium containing either 3 μm DCU and 2 μm calcium ionophore A23187 or the ionophore alone. The radioactivity remaining in the medium after the incubation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Lipids contained in the medium were extracted twice with 4 ml of ice-cold ethyl acetate saturated with water; the extracts were combined; the solvent was evaporated under N2; and the residue was dissolved in acetonitrile. The lipids were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a Gilson dual pump gradient system equipped with model 306 pumps, a model 117 Dual wavelength UV detector, a model 231 XL automatic sample injector (Gilson Medical Electronics, Inc., Middleton, WI), and a 3 μm 4.6 × 150-mm Spherisorb C18 column obtained from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). The elution profile consisted of water adjusted to pH 3.4 with phosphoric acid and an acetonitrile gradient that increased from 27.5 to 100% over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min (29Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of radioactivity was measured by combining the column with scintillator solution and passing the mixture through an on-line flow detector (IN/US Systems, Inc., Tampa, FL). The lipids were extracted from the PCEC with a 2:1 mixture of chloroform/methanol. After the phases were separated and the solvent removed under N2, the lipids were dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol, and an aliquot of this mixture was dried under N2 and assayed for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (25Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. VanRollins M. Spector A.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the distribution of the radioactivity in the cell lipids, aliquots of the extract were separated by TLC on Whatman LK5D silica gel plates obtained from Alltech Associates (Deerfield, IL) with a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 40% methylamine (65:35:5, v/v/v). The radioactivity contained in the separated lipids was assayed using a Radiomatic gas flow proportional scanner with automatic peak search and integration (25Fang X. Kaduce T.L. Weintraub N.L. VanRollins M. Spector A.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Authentic phospholipid standards purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Naperville, IL) were added to each chromatogram and visualized by staining (30Fang X. VanRollins M. Kaduce T.L. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1236-1246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To separate and identify the radiolabeled fatty acid derivatives incorporated in the PCEC lipids, additional aliquots of the extract were hydrolyzed for 1 h at 50 °C in 0.5 ml of methanol containing 50 μl of 0.2 n NaOH and 10% H2O. After the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with ice-cold H3PO4/H2O (1:50, v/v), the free fatty acids were extracted twice with 5 ml of ice-cold ethyl acetate saturated with H2O. The solvent was removed under N2, and the lipids were dissolved in acetonitrile and separated by reverse-phase HPLC (29Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Weintraub N.L. Spector A.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Hewlett-Packard 1100 MSD LC/MS system was used to separate and identify the metabolites (31Bernstrom K. Kayganich K. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HPLC was carried out on a Supelco C18 5 μm 4.6 × 150 mm DiscoveryTM column with mobile phase solvents consisting of water/formic acid (100:0.03 v/v) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The gradient was maintained at 30% solvent B for the first 2 min and then linearly ramped to 57% solvent B at 20 min, 65% solvent B at 40 min, 70% solvent B at 45 min, and 95% solvent B at 50 min. Negative ion electrospray was used with the fragmentor voltage set at 140 V in order to produce in-source collision-induced decompositions (CID). N2 nebulizing gas was maintained at 60 bar, whereas the N2 drying gas was set to a flow rate of 10 liters/min at 350 °C. Data were processed with the Hewlett-Packard Chemstation software program. To confirm the identification of the metabolites, additional studies were done with [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-2H8]14,15-EET ([2H8]14,15-EET, Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). The PCEC cultures were incubated initially with 10 μm DCU for 45 min, and then 5 μm [2H8]14,15-EET was added and the incubation continued for 5 h. After the media and cells were separated, the lipids were extracted from each and were analyzed by LC/MS as indicated above. Harvested PCEC were suspended in 1 ml of chilled 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and dithiothreitol. The cells were disrupted using a Polytron homogenizer at 9,000 rpm for 30 s; the homogenate was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; and the supernatant solution was used as the enzyme extract. Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA assay. Epoxide hydrolase activity was measured using racemic [3H]trans-1,3-diphenylpropene oxide (tDPPO), a selective substrate for the enzyme (32Borhan B. Mebrahtu T. Nazarian S. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The tDPPO was synthesized by reducing the chemical precursor with [3H]sodium borohydride (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to give a final specific activity of 50 mCi/mmol (32Borhan B. Mebrahtu T. Nazarian S. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After the tDPPO was diluted with unlabeled material, 1 μl of a 5 mm solution of [3H]tDPPO in dimethylformamide was added to 100 μl of enzyme preparation in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mg/ml albumin. The final tDPPO concentration was 50 μm. After incubating at 30 °C for 15 min, the reaction was quenched by addition of 60 μl of methanol and 200 μl of isooctane. These solvents extracted the remaining epoxide from the aqueous phase, and the quantity of radioactive diol present in the aqueous phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Each assay was performed in triplicate. The data are expressed as means ± S.E. Values were analyzed by Student's t test for unpaired data. Probability values of 0.05 or less were considered to be statistically significant. The 9000 ×g supernatant solution from the PCEC homogenate was incubated with [3H]tDPPO, a substrate that is specific for sEH (32Borhan B. Mebrahtu T. Nazarian S. Kurth M.J. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The preparation produced 2.1 nmol min−1 mg protein−1 of radiolabeled diol metabolite, demonstrating that the coronary artery endothelial cells contain sEH activity. This finding is consistent with previous studies indicating that PCEC cultures convert 14,15-EET and 8,9-EET to the corresponding DHETs (21Weintraub N.L. Fang X. Kaduce T.L. VanRollins M. Chatterjee P. Spector A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2098-H2108PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of sEH in endothelial EET metabolism, we determined whether DCU, a potent and selective inhibitor of recombinant sEH (18Morisseau C. Goodrow M.H. Dowdy D. Zheng J. Greene J.F. Sanborn J.R. Hammock B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8849-8854Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), would inhibit the conversion of EET to DHET in intact PCEC. The cultures were incubated for either 75 min or 4 h with 2 μm [3H]14,15-EET, with or without 3 μm DCU, and the distribution of radiolabeled products in the culture medium was determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Representative chromatograms are shown in Fig. 1. 14,15-DHET accounted for 85% of the radioactivity contained in the medium of control cultures after a 75-min incubation, and less than 10% remained as EET (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, when DCU was added to the medium, most of the radioactivity remained as 14,15-EET and only 13% was converted to 14,15-DHET after 75 min (Fig.1 B). Small amounts of two additional radiolabeled products, designated X and Y with retention times of 25.6 and 31 min, respectively, were detected in the medium of the cultures treated with DCU. When the incubation was extended to 4 h, 14,15-DHET accounted for >95% of the radioactivity in the medium (Fig. 1 C). However, when DCU was present during the 4-h incubation, EET remained the most abundant radiolabeled compound in the medium, X and Y increased, and DHET accounted for only 35% of the radioactivity (Fig.1 D). Additional experiments further investigated the time-dependent effect of DCU and the effect of increasing DCU concentrations on [3H]14,15-EET metabolism. After incubation, the medium obtained from each culture was assayed by HPLC, and the differences in radiolabeled metabolite production are illustrated in Fig. 2. The inhibition of 14,15-DHET formation approached a maximum at 3 μm DCU when the PCEC were incubated with 2 μm[3H]14,15-EET for 75 min (Fig. 2 A), and the calculated IC50 of DCU was 0.23 μm. Radiolabeled DHET accumulation reached a maximum in 1–2 h when no inhibitor was present. However, it increased much more slowly when 3 μm DCU was present, and 50% less 14,15-DHET was formed at the end of the 8-h incubation (Fig. 2 B). The amounts of radiolabeled metabolites X and Y in the medium during the 8-h incubation with DCU are shown in Fig. 2 C. Product Y formed more rapidly, reached a maximum at 4 h, and then declined, whereas product X increased progressively and was more abundant at the end of the 8-h incubation. The three main radiolabeled compounds that accumulated in media containing DCU were identified by LC/MS (Fig. 3). In-source CID was utilized to generate additional structural information. The mass spectra of deuterium-labeled metabolites isolated from the medium following incubation of PCEC cultures with [2H8]14,15-EET also were obtained to confirm the assignments to the fragment ions in the spectra of the metabolites. The mass spectrum of 14,15-EET contains a (M − H)−ion of m/z 319, an ion of m/z 301 due to loss of one water molecule, and an ion of m/z 219 from fragmentation of the carbon chain through the oxirane ring (31Bernstrom K. Kayganich K. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Adams J. Gross M.L. Org. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 23: 307-316Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The fragment ion of m/z 257, which is of lesser importance, could be the result of loss of water and either loss of CO2 or loss of a neutral alkene and H2 via charge remote fragmentation (31Bernstrom K. Kayganich K. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The identity of the compound, which appeared to be 14,15-EET based on HPLC retention time (Fig. 1), was confirmed by the mass spectrum (Fig.3 A) and that of the corresponding deuterated analog (Fig.3 B). The (M − H)− and fragment ions that are analogous to those of 14,15-EET are labeled in the mass spectra of metabolites Y and X. These ions were utilized to determine the molecular weight, if an epoxide is present, and the location of the epoxide ring in the carbon chain. Comparison of the in-source CID mass spectra of metabolite Y (Fig. 3 C) and its deuterated analog (Fig. 3D) indicates that the masses of the (M − H)− ions (m/z 265 and 272) differ by 7 daltons. The fragment ions corresponding to the loss of water (m/z 247 and 254) also differ by 7 Da, but the fragment ions that are the result of carbon chain cleavage at the epoxide ring (m/z 165 and 171) differ by only 6 Da. This confirms that due to the in-source CID the (M − H)− ions are fragmenting via cleavage of the carbon chain at the epoxide ring, and one deuterium is retained by the neutral loss. Thus, the structure of metabolite Y is consistent with a structure of 10,11-epoxyhexadecadienoic acid (10,11-epoxy-16:2). Both the in-source CID mass spectra of metabolite X (Fig.3 E) and its deuterated analog (Fig. 3 F) show abundant (M − H)− ions of m/z 239 and 245, ions due to loss of water (m/z 221 and 227), and ions due to carbon chain cleavage at the oxirane ring (m/z 139 and 144). The data suggest a structure of 8,9-epoxytetradecaneoic acid (8,9-epoxy-14:1). These findings indicate that in addition to being converted to diols by sEH, 14,15-EET can undergo β-oxidation by endothelial cells, with each cycle removing two carbons from the carboxyl end of the molecule. A series of experiments was done to determine whether inhibition of sEH would affect the amount of 14,15-EET taken up and retained by the P"

Unlike human VEGF-D, that binds both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, mouse VEGF-D is specific for VEGFR-3 in the mouse; it does not bind mouse VEGFR-2. This finding suggests that the biological functions of VEGF-D in mouse and man may differ. Mouse VEGF-D consists of the VHD, amino acid residues 97–206 tagged at the N terminus with the FLAG octapeptide (Scientific Imaging Systems) (31Achen M.G. Roufail S. Domagala T. Catimel B. Nice E.C.

Mouse VEGF-D-Cterm-FLAG is identical to mouse VEGF-D except that it is tagged at the C terminus with FLAG instead of at the N terminus.

Expression and purification of the extracellular domain of mouse VEGFR-2 (VEGFR-2-FLAG) has been described previously (33Stacker S.A. Vitali A. Caesar C. Domagala T. Groenen L.C. Nice E. Achen M.G.

Chimeric proteins consisting of the extracellular domain of human VEGFR-2 (the first four Ig-like domains), human VEGFR-3 (the first three Ig-like domains), or mouse VEGFR-3 (the first three Ig-like domains) and the Fc portion of IgG (hVEGFR-2-Ig, hVEGFR-3-Ig, and mVEGFR-3-Ig, respectively) were expressed by transient transfection of 293EBNA cells with expression plasmids for these Ig fusion proteins (kind gifts from K. Pajusola and Y. Gunji, Helsinki, Finland). Ig fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with M2 monoclonal antibody were carried out as described previously (27Stacker S.A. Stenvers K. Caesar C. Vitali A. Domagala T. Nice E.

The extinction coefficient for mouse and human VEGF-D was estimated based on amino acid composition using the ProtParam tool program at the ExPASy website 3Contact corresponding author for Website address.). Quantitation of mouse and human VEGF-D was by spectrophotometry at 280 nm. The relative abundance of mouse, human, and mutants of VEGF-D was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining of serial dilutions of these proteins. Bioassays for monitoring the binding and cross-linking of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 involved the use of cell lines expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular, ligand-binding domain of mouse VEGFR-2 or human VEGFR-3 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). In addition, cells expressing chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain of the mouse endothelial cell receptor Tie2 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of EpoR were used as a non-responding cell line. The chimeric receptors had been transfected into the Ba/F3 cell line, a line of pre-B cells, which survives and proliferates in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) but which dies after IL-3 deprivation. It has been shown previously that signaling from the cytoplasmic EpoR domain of chimeric receptors upon ligand binding is capable of rescuing these cells in the absence of IL-3 (34Pacifici R.E. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1571-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the VEGFR-2/EpoR, VEGFR-3/EpoR, and Tie2/EpoR chimeric receptors in Ba/F3 cells allows detection of specific ligand binding and cross-linking of the extracellular domains of these receptors, which results in signaling from the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR and cell survival and proliferation in the absence of IL-3. The cell lines expressing the chimeric receptors are designated VEGFR-2-EpoR-Ba/F3 (15Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Samples of purified mouse and human VEGF-D were diluted in cell culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1.2 mg/ml G418) deficient in IL-3. Bioassay cell lines were then incubated in the media for 48 h at 37 °C, and DNA synthesis was then quantitated by the addition of 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine and further incubation for 4 h prior to harvesting using an automated cell harvester (Tomtec®). Incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by β-counting (Canberra Packard “Top Count NXT™ ”; scintillation counter, Meriden, CT). All protein preparations were analyzed for homogeneity, and buffer was exchanged into the appropriate buffers by micropreparative size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography using a Superose 12 (3.2/30) column installed in a SMART™ system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) immediately prior to use (36Nice E.C. Catimel B. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Receptor domains were coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran layer of a CM5 sensor chip using standard amine coupling chemistry (36Nice E.C. Catimel B. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) for analysis of ligand binding using a BIAcore 3000 optical biosensor (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Automatic targeting of immobilization levels was achieved using BIAcore 3.1 control software (37Catimel B. Domagala T. Nerrie M. Weinstock J. White S. Abud H. Heath J. Nice E. Protein Pept. Lett. 1999; 6: 319-340Google Scholar). Following immobilization, residual activated ester groups were blocked by treatment with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5, followed by washing with 10 mm diethylamine to remove non-covalently bound material. The 10 mm diethylamine was also used to regenerate the sensor surface between analyses. Samples for assay were diluted in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20). The integrity of the surface was assessed by binding of purified mouse and human VEGF-D. The apparent binding affinities of mouse and human VEGF-D to receptor domains were determined by analysis of the initial dissociation phase to obtain the kd, which was then used to constrain a global analysis of the association region of the curves assuming a 1:1 Langmuirian model. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (38Catimel B. Nerrie M. Lee F.T. Scott A.M. Ritter G. Welt S. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. J.

Two non-overlapping antisense RNA probes, homologous to the regions of mouse VEGF-D cDNA (GenBankTM accession number X99572) encoding from amino acid residues 1–85 (probe A) and 199–317 (probe B), were used in this study. In addition to encoding the N-terminal 85 amino acids of VEGF-D, probe A also contained 80 nucleotides of the 5′ untranslated region immediately upstream from the translation start codon. Cryostat sections of embryonic day (E) 15.5-mouse embryos were fixed in cold acetone for 10 min, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation in 0.2% H2O2. Sections were blocked for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with goat anti-human VEGFR-3 (Flt-4) affinity-purified antiserum (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-goat Ig-horseradish peroxidase (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) for 45 min. VEGFR-3 staining was detected using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAKO Corp.). As an adsorption control, the VEGFR-3 anti-serum was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 10-fold molar excess of a chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human VEGFR-3 fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (R&D) before being used for immunohistochemistry. Models of human VEGF-D and human VEGFR-2, based on the crystal structure of VEGF in complex with VEGFR-1 (PDB entry 1FLT (39Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Christinger H.W. Eigenbrot C. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar)), were created using MODELLER (40Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar). The model complex includes residues Ile94-Pro197 of VEGF-D and Arg122-Gly220 of VEGFR-2, encompassing the second Ig-like domain that interacts with VEGF (41Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The 1:2 complex of VEGF-D with Ig-like domain 2 of VEGFR-2 was generated by superimposing the coordinates of the VEGF-D and the VEGFR-2 models onto the co-crystal structure. Identification of the highest quality model was achieved using a combination of the MODELLER and ProsaII scores (42Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that mature human VEGF-D, consisting of the VHD, binds, cross-links, and activates VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 (15Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F.

In preliminary studies to analyze the interaction of mouse VEGF-D with VEGFR-2, we observed a lack of binding (data not shown). This was surprising given that the VHDs of mouse and human VEGF-D are closely related in primary structure (Fig.1 A) and that human VEGF-D binds VEGFR-2 (15Achen M.G. Jeltsch M. Kukk E. Mäkinen T. Vitali A. Wilks A.F. Alitalo K. Stacker S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Therefore we used biosensor analysis to investigate the binding of the VHDs of mouse and human VEGF-D to immobilized receptor extracellular domains of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. Mouse and human VEGF-D, each consisting of the VHD tagged at the N terminus with the FLAG octapeptide, were expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”; The identity of these proteins was confirmed by silver staining and Western blot analysis. As expected, the apparent molecular masses of the subunits of these proteins were ∼20 kDa (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of the biosensor binding curves for the interactions of mouse and human VEGF-D with mouse and human VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 demonstrated that mouse VEGF-D did not bind the extracellular domain of mouse VEGFR-2 but bound to mouse VEGFR-3 (Fig. 1 C); human VEGF-D bound both human VEGFR-2 and human VEGFR-3 (Fig. 1 D). These findings indicate that mouse VEGF-D is specific for VEGFR-3 in the mouse but that human VEGF-D interacts with both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in human. Interestingly, mouse VEGF-D bound human VEGFR-2 and human VEGF-D bound mouse VEGFR-2, indicating that the inability of mouse VEGF-D to bind mouse VEGFR-2 may be a consequence of differences in both growth factor and receptor in comparison to the human homologues. The kinetics of the interactions of human VEGF-D with mouse VEGFR-2 and human VEGFR-3 were similar to those documented previously (27Stacker S.A. Stenvers K. Caesar C. Vitali A. Domagala T. Nice E.

To further analyze the interaction of mouse VEGF-D with VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, we used bioassays of receptor binding and cross-linking. The assays involved the use of Ba/F3 pre-B cell lines designated VEGFR-2-EpoR-Ba/F3 (33Stacker S.A. Vitali A. Caesar C. Domagala T. Groenen L.C. Nice E. Achen M.G. Wilks A.F. J. Biol.

In previous studies, all of the activating ligands for VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 (i.e. VEGF, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and viral VEGFs) stimulated the VEGFR-2-EpoR-Ba/F3 or VEGFR-3-EpoR-Ba/F3 bioassay cell lines (15Achen M.G.

Both mouse and human VEGF-D were tested in the mouse VEGFR-2 and human VEGFR-3 bioassays (Fig. 2). Mouse VEGF-D did not promote significant proliferation of the VEGFR-2-EpoR-Ba/F3 cells indicating that this ligand cannot bind and cross-link mouse VEGFR-2 at the cell surface (Fig. 2 A). This result is consistent with the biosensor data demonstrating that mouse VEGF-D does not bind immobilized mouse VEGFR-2. Surprisingly, mouse VEGF-D was more potent than human VEGF-D in the human VEGFR-3 bioassay, an ∼10-fold greater concentration of human VEGF-D was required to give comparable stimulation of the VEGFR-3 cell line (Fig. 2 B). Mouse VEGF-D-Cterm-FLAG, a derivative of mature mouse VEGF-D tagged with FLAG at the C terminus rather than at the N terminus, exhibited comparable activity to the N-terminal-tagged derivative in"

During their transit through the spinous and granular layers toward the skin surface, keratinocytes express a specific program of terminal differentiation that culminates in the formation of corneocytes (1Holbrook K.A.

These dead “mummified” cells accumulate and form the outermost cornified layer of epidermis or stratum corneum, (SC)1, which plays a critical role in the physical protection of the body. To maintain a constant SC thickness, as observed in normal epidermis, the continuous generation of corneocytes is balanced by cell shedding at the external surface in the tightly regulated process of desquamation (3Egelrud T. Loden M. Maibach H.I. Dry Skin and Moisturizers: Chemistry and Function. CRC Press, New York2000: 109-117Google Scholar). Cohesion of the SC is largely dependent on modified desmosomes or corneodesmosomes. In fact, at the transition between the granular layer and the SC, profound changes are observed in desmosome morphology. The cytoplasmic plaque, which provides anchorage for cytokeratin intermediate filaments, is no longer visible, and a homogeneous electron-dense plug occurs instead of the characteristic symmetrical tri-lamellar structure of the extracellular core (4Menton D.N.

At a molecular level, the two major adhesive transmembrane components of corneodesmosomes are desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) and desmocollin 1 (Dsc1) (20Arnemann J. Sullivan K.H. Magee A.I. King I.A.

Desmogleins and desmocollins are glycoproteins belonging to the family of cadherins, calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules. Each desmosomal cadherin is known to exist in three different isoforms encoded by three different genes. Their expression is tissue-specific and differentiation-dependent, Dsg1 and Dsc1 being expressed in the uppermost layers of the epidermis (for a review see (21Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A.

Simon M. Montézin M. Haftek M. Vincent C. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22640-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The suggested function of these structural motifs, which are found in other epidermal proteins such as cytokeratins and loricrin, is to interact with identical loops on the same or neighboring proteins (25Steinert P.M. Mack J.W. Korge B.P. Gan S.-Q. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Some experimental evidence was obtained in favor of a role for Cdsn in corneocyte cohesion (26Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 2N. Jonca, M. Guerrin, C. Caubet, M. Simon, and G. Serre, manuscript in preparation.2N. Jonca, M. Guerrin, C. Caubet, M. Simon, and G. Serre, manuscript in preparation. During the maturation of the SC, the protein is progressively proteolysed. We previously proposed that the process results in the suppression of the two glycine loop-related domains, thus eliminating the adhesive parts of the molecule and allowing desquamation (23Simon M.

Until now, the enzymes involved, and the precise steps, in this proteolysis were not known. Here, we show that Cdsn deglycosylation is unnecessary for proteolysis to occur in vivo, and we characterize the Cdsn cleavage steps and their sequence. Finally, we show that Cdsn is a good substrate in vitro for both SCTE and SCCE. The anti-Cdsn monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) G36-19 and F28-27 are part of a series of antibodies produced and characterized in our laboratory (9Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F.

DG3.10, a MoAb directed to Dsg1 and Dsg2, and PG5.1, a MoAb directed to plakoglobin, were purchased from Progen Biotechnik GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany). An anti-γ-catenin MoAb from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) was also used. The ascites fluid of MOPC-21 (Sigma) was used as a negative control. An anti-involucrin antiserum was purchased from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, CA). Antibodies to the N- and C-terminal domains of Cdsn were elicited in rabbits by injection of synthetic peptides conjugated via a C-terminal cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The peptides used were synthesized according to the predicted amino acid sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF030130) as follows: peptide A, DPCKDPTRITSPNDPC (amino acids 40–55); peptide B, SAGSFKPGTGYSQVSC (amino acids 102–115 with an added C-terminal cysteine residue); peptide C, GSPYHPCGSASQSPC (amino acids 409–423); and peptide D, DGSPHPDPSAGAKPC (amino acids 472–486). Anti-peptide antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (CovalAb, Lyon, France). The antisera were affinity-purified on their corresponding peptide coupled to agarose-activated affinity columns (SulfoLink® kit) essentially as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). Elution fractions obtained when the antisera were loaded on an affinity column coupled with a peptide different from that used for their production were used as negative controls. As previously described (23Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), dermo-epidermal cleavage of breast skin (obtained from patients undergoing plastic surgery) was performed by heat treatment, and the epidermis was sequentially extracted in a Tris-EDTA buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (TENP-40 buffer extract), 8 m urea (TEU buffer extract), or urea and dithiothreitol (TEUDTT buffer extract). Superficial SC extracts were obtained from volunteers using varnish stripping as previously reported (24Guerrin M. Simon M. Montézin M. Haftek M. Vincent C. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22640-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proteins were solubilized in the presence of 2% SDS (or 8 m urea for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis) and 50 mm dithiothreitol, and their concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay™ (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or by two-dimensional electrophoresis in the presence of urea as previously described (23Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or electrotransferred to reinforced nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were stained with either Ponceau Red or Protogold (British BioCell International, Cardiff, UK) and probed with antibodies as previously reported (23Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The anti-γ-catenin MoAb, G36-19, F28-27, and MOPC-21 were diluted to 0.1 μg/ml, and DG3.10 and PG5.1 were diluted to 0.5 μg/ml. Affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies used were diluted to 1/250 or 1/500. Immunoreactivities were revealed with the ECL™ Western blotting kit as described by the manufacturer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Proteins of the SC extracts were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with biotinylated lectins as previously described (23Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In SC extracts (10 μg of protein), Nonidet P-40 and EDTA concentrations were adjusted to 1% and 20 mm, respectively. To the extracts, 2.4 units ofN-glycosidase F (EC 3.5.1.52, Oxford GlycoSystems Ltd., Abingdon, UK) were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The reactions were stopped by boiling for 2 min in sample buffer. Treated and mock samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Deglycosylation of a TENP-40 buffer extract was used as a positive control. Immunohistochemistry was performed on Bouin's fixed samples of breast skin embedded in paraffin using the peroxidase-labeled streptavidin-biotin amplification method and on cryosections of breast skin using indirect immunofluorescence. G36-19, F28-27, and MOPC-21 were diluted to 2.5 μg/ml, and the affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies were diluted to 1/20 or 1/50. On controls, where parallel sections were reacted in the absence of primary antibody, no significant immunoreactivity was observed. Immunoelectron microscopy was performed on normal skin fragments using postembedding methods or labeling of cryosections essentially as described previously (9Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C.

A mild fixation of the tissue in 3% paraformaldehyde for 3 h was used prior to low-temperature embedding in Lowicryl K4M (Polysciences Europe GmbH, Eppelheim, Germany), whereas cryofixation in liquid propane preceded the embedding in Lowicryl K11M (Polysciences). For ultracryosectioning, the fragments were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, soaked for 30 min in 2.3 m saccharose, and plunge-frozen in liquid propane. Cryosections of 80 nm were obtained at −110 °C. In all cases, the ultrathin sections were harvested on Formvar-coated nickel grids and subjected to immunostainings. The primary antibodies were revealed using either a 5-nm immunogold conjugate (goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or AuroProbe One, a 1-nm colloidal gold conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by silver enhancement (IntenSE M kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as published (9Serre G.

Negative controls included sections incubated with PBS or with non-immune rabbit serum instead of the primary antibodies. Recombinant ProSCCE was produced using murine C127 cells, purified and activated with agarose-bound trypsin as previously described (14Hansson L. Strömqvist M. Bäckman A. Wallbrandt P. Carlstein A. Egelrud T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19420-19426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epidermal extracts enriched in SCTE were obtained as published (17Brattsand M. Egelrud T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30033-30040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In proteolysis experiments, 50 ng of recombinant ProSCCE or SCCE, 100 ng of enriched epidermal SCTE, or an equal volume of proteolysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl) were added to the TENP-40 buffer extract (70 μg of proteins) together with 10 times the concentrated proteolysis buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 0–4 h. The reactions were stopped by boiling for 2 min in sample buffer. Treated and mock samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. To examine whether Cdsn deglycosylation is necessary for proteolysis to occur, proteins of superficial SC extracts obtained by varnish stripping from six different individuals were treated withN-glycosidase F and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-Cdsn MoAb G36-19 directed to amino acids 306–309. Staining of the proteins with Protogold did not show any apparent degradation of the proteins during incubation (data not shown). The antibody stained several Cdsn fragments of 46–30 kDa. The glycosidase treatment induced a decrease of ∼4 kDa in the apparent molecular mass of the 46–43-kDa Cdsn fragments present in all the extracts as illustrated for three individuals in Fig. 1. The treatment also induced a decrease in the apparent molecular mass of the 36-kDa Cdsn fragments in some of the extracts as shown for individuals 1 and 2. However, the smaller fragments did not show any modification in their migration rate. These results strongly suggest persistence ofN-glycosylation of the larger Cdsn fragments. To confirm these data, proteins of the SC extracts were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed with biotinylated lectins and with G36-19. Concanavalin A and Pisum sativumagglutinin strongly bound to proteins that probably correspond to proteolysis products of desmosomal cadherins. These lectins also bound the high but not the low molecular weight fragments of Cdsn. The other lectins tested (wheat germ and Ricinus communis agglutinins) did not stain any proteins (data not shown). As a whole, these results indicate that the 46–43- and 36-kDa forms of Cdsn are N-glycosylated, like the 52–56-kDa precursor form. To precisely determine the proteolysis steps of Cdsn maturation and to examine the fate of Cdsn fragments at the SC surface, four antibodies were developed and affinity-purified against peptides corresponding to different domains of the protein: serum A40–55specifically recognizes the N terminus between the signal peptide and the N-terminal glycine loop-related domain (amino acids 40–55), sera B102–115 and C409–423 recognize the N- and C-terminal glycine loop-related domains, respectively (amino acids 102–115 and 409–423, respectively), and serum D472–486is specific to the C terminus of Cdsn (amino acids 472–486). The specificity of the affinity-purified sera was tested against Cdsn produced in Escherichia coli as a His-tag recombinant protein2. All of the sera detected the protein. Moreover, their reactivity was specifically suppressed by incubation in the presence of the peptide used for their production (data not shown). The antibody reactivity was then investigated by immunoblotting analysis of sequential extracts of human breast epidermis and compared with the reactivity of the anti-Cdsn MoAb, F28-27, directed to amino acids 349–353 (Fig. 2 A). The epidermis was sequentially extracted in equal volumes of a detergent-containing buffer (TENP-40 buffer extract), 8 murea-containing buffer (TEU buffer extract), and finally an 8m urea- and dithiothreitol-containing buffer (TEUDTT buffer extract). As previously described (23Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), F28-27 stained the 52–56-kDa Cdsn that was mainly extracted in the presence of a detergent (lane 1) and several Cdsn fragments of lower apparent molecular mass from 48 to 40 kDa that were partly extracted in the presence of urea and partly in the presence of the reducing agent (lanes 2 and 3). Serum A40–55 detected only the 52–56-kDa Cdsn. In addition to this 52–56-kDa form, the serum B102–115 also recognized some of the fragments detected by F28-27. Serum C409–423 stained the 52–56-kDa Cdsn and all the fragments detected by F28-27. In addition, it stained a protein whose molecular weight and abundance strongly suggest that it is cytokeratin K14. The binding to this 49-kDa protein was due to cross-reactivity as it disappeared together with the anti-Cdsn reactivity after absorption of the purified serum on the C peptide. Serum D472–486 detected only the 52–56-kDa Cdsn. To characterize the molecular forms of Cdsn present at the surface of human epidermis more precisely, superficial SC extracts from five individuals were analyzed by immunoblotting with the purified sera (Fig. 2 B). A complex pattern of molecular species with molecular masses extending from 46 to 30 kDa was revealed with F28-27, as previously published (24Guerrin M. Simon M. Montézin M. Haftek M. Vincent C. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22640-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Serum A40–55 did not detected any protein. Serum B102–115 detected only the higher molecular weight fragment. Serum C409–423 reacted with exactly the same fragments as F28-27. Serum D472–486showed a very faint reaction with bands of apparent molecular mass between 46 and 35 kDa. After a longer exposure time, MoAb F28-27 and serum C409–423 additionally recognized identical Cdsn forms with molecular masses down to 15 kDa (data not shown). To determine where in the epidermis Cdsn is proteolysed, immunohistochemical studies were performed using the affinity-purified sera on unfixed cryosections of skin as well as on sections of Bouin's fixed skin (Fig. 3). On cryosections, serum A40–55 showed a weak microgranular and cytoplasmic labeling of the granular keratinocytes. This labeling was not observed on fixed skin sections. Serum B102–115 stained not only the granular cells with the same pattern but also the lower SC. The labeling intensity was strong on unfixed skin cryosections but weak on fixed skin sections. Like F28-27, sera C409–423and D472–486 showed, on unfixed as well as on fixed skin, an intense granular cytoplasmic staining of the granular keratinocytes with a weaker reaction on the lower SC. In addition, and in agreement with its reactivity against K14 on immunoblots, serum C409–423 stained the cytoplasm of the basal keratinocytes. We also immunohistochemically analyzed corneocytes spontaneously detached from human skin and collected on microscope slides. Only one of the purified sera, namely serum C409–423, and MoAb F28-27 labeled the desquamated corneocytes. Both antibodies showed a granular staining of the corneocyte surface (data not shown) similar to the previously observed labeling produced by the anti-Cdsn MoAb G36-19 on corneocytes scraped from hard palate (9Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The histological observations were confirmed and extended using immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 4). Various pre- and postembedding indirect immunogold labeling methods were performed to make sure that the observed reactivities indeed reflected the presence or absence of Cdsn. Keratinosomes were the only structures decorated by purified serum A40–55 (Fig.4 A). The labeling was specific and reproducible but very faint even without chemical fixation or with use of small gold particles and silver enhancement on non-embedded ultracryosections. In addition to staining these secretion vesicles, purified serum B102–115 decorated the extracellular part of both the desmosomes in the granular layer and of the corneodesmosomes in the lowermost part of the SC (Fig. 4, B and C). Purified serum C409–423 labeled intermediate filaments of the basal keratinocytes, keratinosomes in the upper spinous and granular keratinocytes, desmosomes of the upper granular keratinocytes, and corneodesmosomes. As previously observed with G36-19 (9Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Investig.

The purified serum D472–486 labeled keratinosomes and faintly decorated some desmosomes (Fig. 4,E and F). Two proteases present in the SC, namely SCTE and SCCE, have been suggested to be involved in desquamation. To test whether Cdsn actually is a substrate of these enzymes, TENP-40 buffer extracts were treated for 2 h with SCTE or wi"

Following an action potential, the cardiac and skeletal muscle RyR isoforms release Ca2+ from an intracellular Ca2+ storing membrane compartment, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), in a process known as excitation-contraction coupling. Numerous endogenous effectors are known to regulate RyR function and therefore muscle contractility. These effectors range from ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) to other small molecules (adenine nucleotides) to polypeptides such as calmodulin (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol.

We previously uncovered a striking plasticity of redox state in RyR1 channel activity (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). RyR1 free thiol content and channel activity were dynamically controlled by GSH/GSSG, oxygen tension, and NO. Other recent studies have shown that RyR1 responds to changes in transmembrane glutathione redox potential (14Feng W. Liu G. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35902-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and contains thiols whose redox potential is dependent on ligands (Ca2+, Mg2+) that control RyR1 activity (15Xia R.H. Stangler T. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36556-36561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).In this study, we used SIN-1 to probe the effect of redox state on RyR1 activity and have done so under a spectrum of redox conditions that are encountered in muscle, by further varying GSH/GSSG andpO2. SIN-1 spontaneously generates NO and O⨪2 (27Saren M. Michel C. Bors W. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), both of which rapidly combine in a 1:1 stoichiometry to form the highly oxidative species peroxynitrite, although NO/O⨪2 chemistry may produce other species as well (28Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 285-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ducrocq C. Blanchard B. Pignatelli B. Ohshima H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). While NO and O⨪2 are modulators of muscle contractility (16Reid M.B. Khaeli F.A. Moody M.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,17Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25557-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), we consider it unlikely that NO reacted with the RyR1, since we were unable to detect it with a NO electrode. Furthermore, SIN-1 and free NO modulate the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel by two very different redox-related mechanisms. NO activates the channel at pO2 ∼10 mm Hg byS-nitrosylation of a single cysteine per RyR1 subunit (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), whereas SIN-1 affected channel activity by the oxidation of a large number of thiols. NO/O⨪2 generation is likely to be encountered in normally functioning muscle and in pathological states. Indeed, immunoblotting with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody revealed endogenous and SIN-1-mediated nitration in a protein that co-migrated with the SR Ca2+-ATPase, confirming a previous report (37Viner R.I. Ferrington D.A. Williams T.D. Bigelow D.J. Schöneich C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Notably, the anti-nitrotyrosine antibody failed to detect endogenous or SIN-1-mediated nitration of tyrosines in RyR1.Exposure to the three redox variables O2, glutathione, and SIN-1 revealed three distinct redox states of RyR1. The free thiol content ranged from as low as 13 to as high as 48 thiols/RyR1 subunit (SH/RyR1s) (see scheme below).Moderate oxidationExtensive oxidationlowreversibleirreversibleRyR1activity⇔RyR1activation⇒RyR1inactivation(∼48–38SH/RyR1s)(∼35–23SH/RyR1s)(∼21–13SH/RyR1s)SCHEME 1RyR1 free thiol content was high and channel activity was low in the presence of 5 mm GSH at pO2∼10 mm Hg; i.e. there are ∼48 free thiols/RyR1 subunit under conditions encountered in normally functioning skeletal muscle. Remarkably, oxidation of ∼10 free thiols/RyR1 subunit (SIN-1 in the presence of 5 mm GSH) had virtually no effect on RyR1 activity, suggesting that RyR1 has a large buffer capacity against oxidants such as O⨪2 or peroxynitrite. In addition, these thiols probably subserve the O2 sensor function that tunes the NO response in muscle (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Moderate oxidative activation (5 mm GSSG, 0.2 mm SIN-1 in the absence of 5 mm GSH) was accounted for by the loss of ∼15 extra thiols and was reversible. Thus, RyR1 can probably respond to moderate changes in cellular redox state with changes in basal setpoint (i.e.a change in activity is maintained across the whole Ca2+concentration range). Extensive oxidative inactivation (1.0 mm SIN-1 in the absence and presence of 5 mmGSSG) was attributed to the loss of up to 10 additional thiols (∼13 free thiols/RyR1 subunit remain) and was irreversible, making it likely to be of pathological rather than physiological significance. Therefore, RyR1 redox state and function appear to be intimately linked.This analysis of RyR1 is reminiscent of our previous studies of RyR2 (12Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Science. 1998; 279: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In the case of RyR1, however, the oxidation of up to 25 thiols was reversible (suggesting the formation of disulfides and/or sulfenic acids), whereas only 5–6 thiols could be oxidized in the cardiac channel before irreversible changes were encountered. Irreversible thiol oxidation (suggesting oxidation to sulfinic or sulfonic acids) was dependent on the concentration of the oxidant (1.0 mmSIN-1) and required the absence of GSH. Although the (patho)physiological correlative of thiol oxidation remains to be elucidated, the finding of endogenous nitration in the SR (Ref. 37Viner R.I. Ferrington D.A. Williams T.D. Bigelow D.J. Schöneich C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar and this study) indicates that such oxidative modifications are likely (i.e. thiols are generally more reactive toward NO/O⨪2 and peroxynitrite than tyrosines (42Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)).Intracellular Ca2+ concentration, the main determinant of skeletal muscle contractile function, is controlled by the RyR1 and an ATP-driven Ca2+ pump, with the former releasing the stored Ca2+ from SR to initiate contraction and the later sequestering Ca2+ back in SR to initiate relaxation. We previously showed that O2 tension dynamically reduced/oxidized 6–8 thiols/RyR1 subunit. The alteration of channel redox state determined its responsiveness to S-nitrosylation by NO of one cysteine per RyR1 subunit, and the effect ofS-nitrosylation on channel activity was transduced via calmodulin (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We believe that such regulation may impact on excitation-contraction coupling. On the other hand, we now show that NO/O⨪2 can transduce its effects on RyR1 independently of calmodulin, thus providing an additional means by which the redox state of the cell may influence RyR1 function. But these findings probably bear on situations characterized by oxidative stress, where we envision that the RyR1 would counter impairments of force production imposed by oxidizing conditions with oxidation-induced activation. Ultimately, however, irreversible oxidation of RyR1 thiols may contribute to dysfunction of muscle. The relevance of these findings to conditions such as in fatigue, spasm, and rhabdomyolysis remains to be shown. Ca2+ release channels/ryanodine receptors (RyRs)1 are the largest known ion channels, consisting of four ∼565-kDa RyR subunits and four associated 12-kDa FK506-binding protein subunits (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Following an action potential, the cardiac and skeletal muscle RyR isoforms release Ca2+ from an intracellular Ca2+ storing membrane compartment, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), in a process known as excitation-contraction coupling. Numerous endogenous effectors are known to regulate RyR function and therefore muscle contractility. These effectors range from ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) to other small molecules (adenine nucleotides) to polypeptides such as calmodulin (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Recent work has also established RyRs as prototypic redox-sensitive ion channels. The skeletal muscle isoform of RyR (RyR1) contains a large number of free thiols: as many as 50 out of a total of 101 cysteine residues/subunit (100 cysteines/RyR1 subunit (3Takeshima H. Nishimura S.

Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). RyR1 channel activity is dramatically altered by redox modifications of critical thiols (oxidation, S-nitrosylation, or alkylation) (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G.

Conversely, RyR1 has thiols whose redox potential is dependent on effectors that regulate RyR1 activity such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ (15Xia R.H. Stangler T. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36556-36561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).

Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). RyR1 free thiol content and channel activity were dynamically controlled by GSH/GSSG, oxygen tension, and NO. Other recent studies have shown that RyR1 responds to changes in transmembrane glutathione redox potential (14Feng W. Liu G. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol.

SIN-1 spontaneously generates NO and O⨪2 (27Saren M. Michel C. Bors W. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), both of which rapidly combine in a 1:1 stoichiometry to form the highly oxidative species peroxynitrite, although NO/O⨪2 chemistry may produce other species as well (28Uppu R.M.

Furthermore, SIN-1 and free NO modulate the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel by two very different redox-related mechanisms. NO activates the channel at pO2 ∼10 mm Hg byS-nitrosylation of a single cysteine per RyR1 subunit (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), whereas SIN-1 affected channel activity by the oxidation of a large number of thiols. NO/O⨪2 generation is likely to be encountered in normally functioning muscle and in pathological states. Indeed, immunoblotting with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody revealed endogenous and SIN-1-mediated nitration in a protein that co-migrated with the SR Ca2+-ATPase, confirming a previous report (37Viner R.I. Ferrington D.A. Williams T.D. Bigelow D.J. Schöneich C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Notably, the anti-nitrotyrosine antibody failed to detect endogenous or SIN-1-mediated nitration of tyrosines in RyR1.Exposure to the three redox variables O2, glutathione, and SIN-1 revealed three distinct redox states of RyR1. The free thiol content ranged from as low as 13 to as high as 48 thiols/RyR1 subunit (SH/RyR1s) (see scheme below).Moderate oxidationExtensive oxidationlowreversibleirreversibleRyR1activity⇔RyR1activation⇒RyR1inactivation(∼48–38SH/RyR1s)(∼35–23SH/RyR1s)(∼21–13SH/RyR1s)SCHEME 1RyR1 free thiol content was high and channel activity was low in the presence of 5 mm GSH at pO2∼10 mm Hg; i.e. there are ∼48 free thiols/RyR1 subunit under conditions encountered in normally functioning skeletal muscle. Remarkably, oxidation of ∼10 free thiols/RyR1 subunit (SIN-1 in the presence of 5 mm GSH) had virtually no effect on RyR1 activity, suggesting that RyR1 has a large buffer capacity against oxidants such as O⨪2 or peroxynitrite. In addition, these thiols probably subserve the O2 sensor function that tunes the NO response in muscle (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Moderate oxidative activation (5 mm GSSG, 0.2 mm SIN-1 in the absence of 5 mm GSH) was accounted for by the loss of ∼15 extra thiols and was reversible. Thus, RyR1 can probably respond to moderate changes in cellular redox state with changes in basal setpoint (i.e.a change in activity is maintained across the whole Ca2+concentration range). Extensive oxidative inactivation (1.0 mm SIN-1 in the absence and presence of 5 mmGSSG) was attributed to the loss of up to 10 additional thiols (∼13 free thiols/RyR1 subunit remain) and was irreversible, making it likely to be of pathological rather than physiological significance. Therefore, RyR1 redox state and function appear to be intimately linked.This analysis of RyR1 is reminiscent of our previous studies of RyR2 (12Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Science. 1998; 279: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In the case of RyR1, however, the oxidation of up to 25 thiols was reversible (suggesting the formation of disulfides and/or sulfenic acids), whereas only 5–6 thiols could be oxidized in the cardiac channel before irreversible changes were encountered. Irreversible thiol oxidation (suggesting oxidation to sulfinic or sulfonic acids) was dependent on the concentration of the oxidant (1.0 mmSIN-1) and required the absence of GSH. Although the (patho)physiological correlative of thiol oxidation remains to be elucidated, the finding of endogenous nitration in the SR (Ref. 37Viner R.I. Ferrington D.A. Williams T.D. Bigelow D.J. Schöneich C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar and this study) indicates that such oxidative modifications are likely (i.e. thiols are generally more reactive toward NO/O⨪2 and peroxynitrite than tyrosines (42Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)).Intracellular Ca2+ concentration, the main determinant of skeletal muscle contractile function, is controlled by the RyR1 and an ATP-driven Ca2+ pump, with the former releasing the stored Ca2+ from SR to initiate contraction and the later sequestering Ca2+ back in SR to initiate relaxation. We previously showed that O2 tension dynamically reduced/oxidized 6–8 thiols/RyR1 subunit. The alteration of channel redox state determined its responsiveness to S-nitrosylation by NO of one cysteine per RyR1 subunit, and the effect ofS-nitrosylation on channel activity was transduced via calmodulin (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We believe that such regulation may impact on excitation-contraction coupling. On the other hand, we now show that NO/O⨪2 can transduce its effects on RyR1 independently of calmodulin, thus providing an additional means by which the redox state of the cell may influence RyR1 function. But these findings probably bear on situations characterized by oxidative stress, where we envision that the RyR1 would counter impairments of force production imposed by oxidizing conditions with oxidation-induced activation. Ultimately, however, irreversible oxidation of RyR1 thiols may contribute to dysfunction of muscle. The relevance of these findings to conditions such as in fatigue, spasm, and rhabdomyolysis remains to be shown. Contracting muscle produces reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (16Reid M.B. Khaeli F.A. Moody M.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 1081-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 17Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S.

Meissner G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 209-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). A functional role of these molecules is indicated by the finding that force development in muscle is affected using nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors and scavengers of superoxide. The data we have presented here imply that the effects of NO/O⨪2-related species are mediated, at least in part, through the SR Ca2+release channel in skeletal muscle. The RyR1 is exquisitely sensitive to redox modulation. Ample evidence indicates that RyRs are activated or inactivated or both by sulfhydryl-modifying molecules (5Eu J.P. Sun J.H. Xu L. Stamler J.S.

However, little is known regarding hypoxic regulation of genes that are directly involved in cell death or death resistance. Here we report the striking induction by severe hypoxia of the anti-apoptotic protein IAP-2. Hypoxic cells with IAP-2 up-regulation became resistant to apoptosis. IAP-2 was induced by hypoxia per se rather than by the secondary effects of hypoxia, including ATP depletion and cell injury. The inductive response did not relate to alterations of cellular redox status or arrest of mitochondrial respiration. On the other hand, IAP-2 induction was attenuated by actinomycin D, suggesting a role for gene transcription. In vitro nuclear run-on assays demonstrated specific increases in IAP-2 transcriptional activity after hypoxia exposure. HIF-1, the primary transcription factor that is responsible for multiple gene activation under hypoxia, does not have a role in IAP-2 expression. HIF-1 and IAP-2 were induced by different degrees of hypoxia; severe hypoxia or anoxia was required for IAP-2 induction. Moreover, cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine activated HIF-1 but not IAP-2. Finally, IAP-2 was induced by severe hypoxia in mouse embryonic stem cells that were deficient of HIF-1.

In ischemic diseases, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and acute renal failure, hypoxia leads to cell death and determines tissue pathology (1Cotran R.S. Kumar V. Collins T. Cotran R.S. Kumar V. Collins T. Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease (6th ed.), Cell Injury and Cellular Death. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1998: 1-29Google Scholar). In solid tumors, hypoxia selects death-resistant cells, which confer poor prognosis and contribute to cancer progression (2Brown J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5863-5870PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sutherland R.M. Acta Oncol. 1998; 37: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4Semenza G.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 71-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Under hypoxia, some cells are irreversibly injured and die whereas others can adapt to the stressful environment and survive. The factors that determine the fate of individual cells under hypoxia are poorly understood. However, expression of specific genes within these cells appears to be a key (5Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). In response to hypoxia, mammalian cells express a variety of gene products, including erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter, and glycolytic enzymes (5Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 6Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). These proteins either increase oxygen delivery or enhance glycolysis to facilitate metabolic adaptation. In 1992, the critical transcription factor HIF-1,1 which is responsible for hypoxic activation of multiple genes, was identified (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix-per-aryl hydrocarbon receptor ARNT-sim (PAS) domain protein, consisting of α and β subunits (8Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). Although HIF-1β is constitutively expressed, HIF-1α is precisely regulated by cellular oxygen levels. Under hypoxia, HIF-1α is induced, dimerizes with β subunits, translocates to the nucleus, and initiates gene transcription (6Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). Originally identified by its regulation of erythropoietin, HIF-1 has now been shown to play a central role in hypoxic expression of a variety of genes and is considered to be a master transcription factor that governs adaptive gene expression under situations of oxygen deficiency (5Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 9Semenza G.L. J. Appl.

Despite intense investigation of gene expression under hypoxia, little has been learned about hypoxic regulation of genes that are directly involved in cell death or death resistance (5Bunn H.F.

In the current study, we show that the cell death inhibitory protein IAP-2 is strikingly induced by severe hypoxia. IAP-2 is a member of the family of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), which were originally discovered in baculoviruses and subsequently cloned from metazoans, including human (11Crook N.E. Clem R.J.

These studies suggest a pivotal role for IAPs in maintenance of tissue homeostasis and protection against deleterious insults. Our results show that hypoxic cells overexpress IAP-2 and become resistant to apoptosis. IAP-2 up-regulation under hypoxia does not result from ATP depletion, cellular redox status alteration, or respiration arrest; rather, the key to the inductive response is lack of oxygen per se. IAP-2 induction involves gene transcription; however, HIF-1, the primary hypoxia-responsive transcription factor, is shown to be not involved. Thus, the results not only demonstrate the striking induction of an anti-apoptotic gene by hypoxia but also imply novel hypoxia-responsive transactivation mechanisms. Rat kidney proximal tubule cells (RPTC) were provided by U. Hopfer (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). RPTC overexpressing Bcl-2 were obtained by stable transfection of a vector containing bcl-2 cDNA (22Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The bcl-2 vector was a gift from J. Yuan (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Wild type and HIF-1α null mouse embryonic stem cells were generated as described previously (23Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were kindly provided by N. Pinckard (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Other cells used in this study were purchased from ATCC. The cells were maintained following standard procedures. The monoclonal antibody to Bax was a gift from R. Youle (NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The monoclonal antibody to HIF-1α was purchased from Novus Biologicals, Inc. (Littleton, CO). Polyclonal antibodies to Bcl-2, IAP-1, IAP-2, and XIAP were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). We prepared two polyclonal IAP-2 antibodies recognizing different epitopes to verify the identity of IAP-2. VAD was from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Ebselen, MnTBAP, rotenone, antimycin A, myxothiazole, oligomycin, and carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co. (San Diego, CA). Radioactive chemicals were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Other reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). An in vitro model of hypoxia-reoxygenation has been described previously (22Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M.

J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and was adopted in this study. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to an anaerobic chamber with 95% N2/5% CO2, and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. This buffer was pre-equilibrated with 95% N2/5% CO2. EC Oxyrase, a biocatalytic oxygen-reducing agent, was added at 1.2 unit/ml to the incubation medium to consume residual O2 and maximize the degree of hypoxia. For reoxygenation, cells after hypoxic incubation were transferred back to full culture medium in 95% air/5% CO2. Cells were lysed with a buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mm DTT, and 62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8). Proteins (100 μg/lane) in whole-cell lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-polyacrylamide (4–12%) gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After 1 h of blocking in 2% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C. By the next morning, the membrane was thoroughly washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antigens on the membranes were finally revealed by exposure to chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Total RNA was extracted from control or experimental cells with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). mRNA was subsequently purified with poly(A)Tract (Promega, Madison, MI). Northern hybridization was carried out with a NorthernMax kit purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, mRNA (2 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. Resolved mRNA was transferred to BrightStar-Plus positively charged nylon membranes by downward capillary transfer and cross-linked to the membranes using a UV cross-linker. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C, using an iap-2-specific probe. The probe was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, using primers designed on the basis of the cDNA sequences of rat IAP-2, 2Z. Dong, J. Nishiyama, and M. A. Venkatachalam, unpublished data. The IAP-2 shown in this article is the rat homolog of human IAP-2, mouse IAP-2, and cellular IAP-1 (cIAP-1). and was32P-labeled with the Ready-To-Go random labeling beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). To assess variation in loading and transfer of RNA, the blots were stripped and reprobed with 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. Levels of gene-specific mRNA was revealed by autoradiography. Nuclei from control and experimental cells were isolated by a method modified from Spector et al. (25Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual, Nuclear Run-on Analysis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 25.4-25.15Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by scraping and centrifuging at 500 g/5 min and lysed by 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in the homogenization buffer containing (in mm): 340 sucrose, 60 KCl, 15 NaCl, 2 EDTA, 0.5 EGTA, 1 DTT, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 spermine, 0.5 spermidine, and 15 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Nuclei in cell lysates were purified by centrifugation at 800 g/5 min through a 25% glycerol cushion. Purified nuclei were resuspended in the nuclear storage buffer containing 40% glycerol, and kept frozen in liquid nitrogen. During isolation, nuclear morphology was monitored by phase contrast microscopy. For run-on reaction, ∼75 × 106 nuclei were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the reaction buffer containing (in mm): 150 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 2.5 DTT, 30 Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 ATP, 0.5 CTP, 0.5 GTP, 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 20% glycerol. RNase inhibitor at 20 units/reaction was included to prevent RNA degradation. The reaction was terminated by adding DNase I and proteinase K. RNA was extracted with TRI reagent LS (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Nascent 32P-uridine-labeled RNA species were hybridized to an excess of IAP-2 cDNA or β-actin cDNA (2 μg) that had been immobilized on Zeta-Probe GT membranes by a Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After 36 h of hybridization at 65 °C, blots were washed and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation of the signal was performed by densitometry. Apoptosis was assessed by cell morphology and caspase activity (22Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 24Dong Z. Saikumar P. Patel Y. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Typical morphological alterations used to characterize apoptosis included cellular shrinkage, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (22Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Five fields with ∼200 cells/field in each 35-mm dish were monitored. The experiments were repeated for five times with duplicate dishes for each condition in every experiment. To biochemically analyze apoptosis, caspase activity was measured using the fluorogenic peptide substrate, carbobenzoxy-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (DEVD.AFC) as described in our previous studies (24Dong Z. Saikumar P. Patel Y. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted with 1% Triton X-100. The lysates (25 μg of protein) were added to the enzymatic reactions containing 50 μmDEVD.AFC. After 60 min of reaction at 37 °C, fluorescence was monitored at excitation 360 nm/emission 530 nm. For each measurement, a standard curve was constructed using free AFC. Based on the standard curve, the fluorescence reading from the enzymatic reactions was translated into the molar amount of liberated AFC to indicate caspase activity (24Dong Z. Saikumar P. Patel Y. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein was quantitated with the bicinchoninic acid reagent purchased from Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL. The concentration and purity of RNA were determined spectrophotometrically by absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm. To measure ATP, cells were extracted with trichloroacetic acid. ATP in cell extracts was determined by luminometry of the luciferin firefly luciferase reaction using a kit purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (22Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We initially screened the expression of apoptosis regulatory genes by immunoblotting. For this purpose, RPTC cells were subjected to hypoxic incubation alone or hypoxia followed by reoxygenation. Whole cell lysates were extracted with a buffer containing 2% SDS and analyzed by immunoblotting. The results are shown in Fig. 1. No significant changes were detected in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or its homologue, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Consistent with our previous observations, Bcl-2 was barely detectable in control cells and remained low throughout hypoxia and reoxygenation (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–7), whereas abundant Bcl-2 was shown in cells stably transfected with a bcl-2 vector (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). Cellular levels of Bax were also stable (Fig. 1 A), despite its translocation from cytosol to mitochondria during hypoxia (22Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, IAP-2, an apoptosis inhibitory protein was markedly induced by hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 1 A, basal IAP-2 expression in control cells was quite limited (lane 1), whereas abundant IAP-2 was detected after hypoxic incubation (lanes 2–4). IAP-2 induction reached a maximum during 1 h of hypoxia exposure and, of interest, returned toward basal levels after reoxygenation (Fig.1 A, lane 5). The identity of IAP-2 was verified using three antibodies recognizing different epitopes (data not shown). The antibodies were prepared separately by Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. and by our laboratory. The inductive response was rather specific for IAP-2, because no induction was detected in IAP-1 (Fig. 1 A) or XIAP (data not shown). Hypoxic induction of IAP-2 was not suppressed by glucose, a glycolytic substrate that prevented declines of ATP in hypoxic cells, negating the involvement of ATP depletion in the inductive response (Fig. 1 A, lane 6, Glu). Moreover, neither the caspase inhibitor VAD (carbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) nor Bcl-2 overexpression affected IAP-2 induction (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7,8). The results indicate that IAP-2 expression was not a result of cell injury/death, because VAD and Bcl-2 abolished apoptosis during hypoxia reoxygenation (22Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 24Dong Z. Saikumar P. Patel Y. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hypoxic expression of IAP-2 is not cell-type-specific, and was detected in 3T3 fibroblasts, human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells and primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig.1 B, “C ” for control; “H ” for hypoxia). Similar induction was also shown for malignant human renal carcinoma cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7, 8,HRC). Under hypoxia, cells are exposed to two kinds of immediate stress, i.e. lack of oxygen and declines of cellular ATP. Many pathologic processes are initiated during hypoxia by ATP depletion rather than by oxygen deprivation per se (1Cotran R.S. Kumar V. Collins T. Cotran R.S. Kumar V. Collins T. Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease (6th ed.), Cell Injury and Cellular Death. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1998: 1-29Google Scholar). Thus, to investigate the mechanisms responsible for IAP-2 induction, we first determined whether it is a result of ATP depletion. In our experimental model of hypoxia, progressive decreases of cellular ATP were demonstrated. After 5 h of hypoxic incubation in the absence of metabolic substrates, cell ATP declined to less than 1% of control. Provision of 1 mg/ml glucose, the glycolytic substrate, maintained cellular ATP to a substantial level, ∼70% of control (22Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The fact that glucose given during hypoxia did not mitigate IAP-2 expression (Fig. 1 A, lane 6, Glu) suggests that the induction was not caused by ATP depletion. To substantiate this observation, we examined the effects of stepwise ATP declines. Cells were incubated under normal oxygen atmosphere in a medium containing the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP, which abolishes ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (26Dong Z. Patel Y. Saikumar P. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose, the glycolytic substrate, was provided at 0–0.5 mg/ml along with CCCP to achieve graded degrees of ATP depletion (Fig. 2 A). As a positive control, one group of cells was subjected to 1 h of hypoxic incubation and showed striking IAP-2 induction (Fig.2 B, lane 2). In sharp contrast, IAP-2 expression remained minimal in cells incubated with CCCP in the presence of various amounts of glucose (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–10). Thus, ATP depletion, either severe or mild, did not activate this anti-apoptotic gene. The data imply that, independent of ATP depletion, oxygen deficiency plays a critical role in hypoxic induction of IAP-2. Cellular redox status has been shown to affect gene expression under conditions of oxygen deficiency (27Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 28Ehleben W. Bolling B. Merten E. Porwol T. Strohmaier A.R. Acker H. Respir.

Fandrey J. Pagel H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test whether it played an essential role in IAP-2 induction under hypoxia, we adjusted the redox status of the cells pharmacologically, using two classes of reagents. The first class of chemicals tested were antioxidant, including the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), the cell permeant superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTBAP, and the glutathione peroxidase mimic Ebselen (31Saikumar P. Dong Z. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The second class of chemicals tested included H2O2 andt-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP), which by their nature should augment cellular oxidative status. The results are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that, despite manipulation of cellular redox status, neither the anti-oxidants nor the pro-oxidants could induce IAP-2 expression (lanes 3–7) under normal oxygen tensions. On the contrary, this anti-apoptotic gene was activated by hypoxia in a remarkable manner (lane 2). Data not shown have also demonstrated that the anti-oxidant NAC was not able to ameliorate IAP-2 expression during hypoxia. Collectively, the results suggest that alterations of cellular redox status do not have a critical role in IAP-2 induction under hypoxia. We subsequently examined whether hypoxia up-regulated IAP-2 through its actions on the mitochondrial function. Electron transport in mitochondria is disrupted in cells under situations of oxygen deficiency. This is due to the lack of the terminal electron acceptor, molecular oxygen. Moreover, as depicted in Fig.4 A, hypoxia and its secondary effects, including ATP depletion can also damage the machinery responsible for respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (32Piper H.M. Noll T. Siegmund B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Key components of the respiratory chain have been postulated as the O2 sensors that signal gene expression in hypoxic cells (5Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar,33Acker H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 718: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R. Choe S.H.

Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To investigate the roles played by respiratory macromolecules in apoptotic gene expression, we examined the effects of respiration inhibitors. The rationale for this experiment was that, if hypoxic expression of IAP-2 was triggered by defects in electron transport, then a somewhat similar inductive response should be elicited by poisons targeting the key components of the respiratory chain. The inhibitors tested included the complex I inhibitor rotenone, complex III inhibitors antimycin and myxothiazole, complex IV inhibitor sodium azide, and potassium cyanide. Efficacy of the inhibitors to block respiration in RPTC cells was indicated by their ability to prevent mitochondrial ATP production (data not shown). In addition, we examined the effects of oligomycin, an F0- and F1-ATPase/synthase inhibitor, on IAP-2 expression. The results are shown in Fig. 4 B. Clearly, none of the mitochondrial poisons could mimic hypoxia, with respect to inducing IAP-2. The data suggest that hypoxic expression of this anti-apoptotic gene does not result from respiration defects. Our results presented so far have demonstrated hypoxic induction of IAP-2 at the protein level by immunoblotting. Accumulation of a protein could be the result of increased transcription, mRNA stabilization, or decreased protein turnover. To examine the role of transcription in IAP-2 expression, we initially tested the effects of actinomycin D (Act.D), a DNA-primed RNA polymerase inhibitor that blocks transcription. Cells were pretreated with Act.D for 1 h and then shifted to hypoxic incubation. The results are shown in Fig.5 A. Consistent with our previous observations, IAP-2 was barely detectable in control cells and was markedly induced after hypoxia exposure (lanes 1,2). Of significance, the inductive response was suppressed by 10–100 μg/ml Act.D (lanes 5–8), suggesting a role for transcription. This observation was further supported by Northern analysis of mRNA, using 32P-labeled rat IAP-2-specific probes. As shown in Fig. 5 B, Northern hybridization detected an IAP-2 transcript of ∼3.5 kb. Sizes of the transcript agreed well with the full-length cDNA of rat IAP-2 that we have cloned.2 Moreover, expression of IAP-2 mRNA was significantly increased during hypoxia (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–4); this increase was again suppressed by the transcription inhibitor, Act.D (Fig. B, lane 5). Together, the results suggest that gene transcription plays an important role in IAP-2 induction under hypoxia. To further establish a role for transcription in IAP"
https://openalex.org/W2144271192,"c-Abl and the Abl-related gene product (Arg) are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that regulate the actin cytoskeleton of cells by direct association with F-actin and localization to focal contacts. However, the biological significance of this interaction is not known. We show here that transfection of COS-7 cells with a kinase-inactive form of c-Abl (Abl) promotes c-Crk II/p130CAS (Crk-CAS) coupling, enhancing cell migration. Moreover, embryonic fibroblast cells isolated from mice devoid of endogenous Abl and Arg (abl−/−arg−/−) demonstrate increased Crk-CAS coupling and motility. Conversely, expression of a kinase-active form of Abl or reconstitution of abl−/− arg−/− cells with wild-type Abl prevents Crk-CAS coupling and inhibits cell migration. Thus, Abl and Arg kinases play a critical role in preventing cell migration through regulation of Crk and CAS adaptor protein complexes, which are necessary for cell movement."
https://openalex.org/W2083629798,"Although polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys29 of ubiquitin have been implicated in the targeting of certain substrates to proteasomes, the signaling properties of these chains are poorly understood. We previously described a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) from erythroid cells that assembles polyubiquitin chains through either Lys29 or Lys48 of ubiquitin (Mastrandrea, L. D., You, J., Niles, E. G., and Pickart, C. M. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 27299–27306). Here we describe the purification of this E3 based on its affinity for a linear fusion of ubiquitin to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5A. Among five major polypeptides in the affinity column eluate, the activity of interest was assigned to the product of a previously cloned human cDNA known as KIAA10 (Nomura, N., Miyajima, N., Sazuka, T., Tanaka, A., Kawarabayasi, Y., Sato, S., Nagase, T., Seki, N., Ishikawa, K., and Tabata, S. (1994) DNA Res. 1, 27–35). The KIAA10 protein is a member of the HECT (homologous to E6-APcarboxyl terminus) domain family of E3s. These E3s share a conserved C-terminal (HECT) domain that functions in the catalysis of ubiquitination, while their divergent N-terminal domains function in cognate substrate binding (Huibregtse, J. M., Scheffner, M., Beaudenon, S., and Howley, P. M. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 2563–2567). Recombinant KIAA10 catalyzed the assembly of both Lys29- and Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. Surprisingly, the C-terminal 428 residues of KIAA10 were both necessary and sufficient for this activity, suggesting that the ability to assemble polyubiquitin chains may be a general property of HECT domains. The N-terminal domain of KIAA10 interacted in vitro with purified 26 S proteasomes and with the isolated S2/Rpn1 subunit of the proteasome's 19 S regulatory complex, suggesting that the N-terminal domains of HECT E3s may function in proteasome binding as well as substrate binding.

The N-terminal domain of KIAA10 interacted in vitro with purified 26 S proteasomes and with the isolated S2/Rpn1 subunit of the proteasome's 19 S regulatory complex, suggesting that the N-terminal domains of HECT E3s may function in proteasome binding as well as substrate binding. ubiquitin dithiothreitol ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin carrier protein ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase final 428 residues of KIAA10 first 655 residues of KIAA10 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ubiquitin-dihydrofolate reductase fusion protein polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase The ubiquitin (Ub)1-proteasome system regulates essential cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, DNA repair, and apotosis (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Substrates of this system are targeted for degradation by 26 S proteasomes through covalent conjugation to Ub. This modification is accomplished by means of the sequential actions of three enzymes. Ub-activating enzyme (E1) first activates Ub by forming a thiol ester through the carboxyl group of Ub residue Gly76. Ub is then transferred to the active site cysteine residue of a ubiquitin carrier protein (E2). Finally, Ub is transferred from the E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate by a Ub-protein isopeptide ligase (E3). Substrates destined for proteolysis by proteasomes are conjugated to multiple molecules of Ub, usually in the form of a homopolymeric chain linked by isopeptide bonds between Lys48 and Gly76 of successive Ub molecules (2Chau V.

Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The Ub conjugation cascade has a hierarchical organization; there is a single E1, many E2s, and even more E3s. The E3s are the principal substrate specificity factors, while the combinatorial interactions of E2s and E3s may allow for increased diversity of substrate recognition (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The known E3s fall into two mechanistic categories. In one class, a zinc-binding RING finger serves as a required structural and/or catalytic motif (6Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Some, but not all, RING E3s are multisubunit complexes in which substrate recognition and the catalysis of ubiquitination are relegated to distinct polypeptides. E3s of the other family, known as HECT domain E3s, transiently accept Ub from the E2, in a thiol ester linkage, prior to transferring it to the substrate (7Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar,8Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). These E3s share a conserved ∼350-amino acid region (the HECT domain) that is defined by its homology toE6-AP carboxyl terminus (7Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). E6-AP, the best studied HECT E3, is responsible for the recognition of the p53 tumor suppressor protein in cells infected with oncogenic human papilloma viruses (9Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The recognition of p53 is mediated principally by the N terminus of E6-AP in conjunction with the viral E6 protein (10Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The current model for HECT E3 structure-function proposes that the divergent N termini of these E3s are responsible for specific substrate binding, while the conserved HECT domain supplies catalytic activity in ubiquitination (7Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Although more than 20 mammalian HECT E3s have been identified based on gene sequence, only a handful of these enzymes have been defined with respect to substrate specificity or function. Although Lys48-linked chains are the principal proteasomal targeting signal, chains linked through other lysine residues have also been observed (11Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Some noncanonical chains appear to execute signaling functions that are independent of proteasomes (12Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Galan J.

Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, the model substrate UbDHFR is targeted to proteasomes in yeast cells by the Ufd (ubiquitin fusion degradation) pathway, in which a poly-Ub chain is extended from Lys29 of the fused Ub moiety of UbDHFR (16Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 19Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The production of poly-Ub chains of n > 3 on UbDHFR requires the HECT E3 Ufd4p, the E2 Ubc4p, and a novel factor called Ufd2p (19Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The linkage of the extended chain on UbDHFR has not been defined. Thus, it remains unclear whether a homogeneous Lys29-linked poly-Ub chain can target a substrate to proteasomes. We previously characterized an E3 from rabbit erythroid cells that assembled poly-Ub chains through either Lys29 or Lys48 (20Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we report the purification of this enzyme by a simple E2 affinity procedure. The chain-assembling E3 proved to be a previously cloned but essentially uncharacterized member of the HECT E3 family. We show that the recombinant E3 utilizes free Ub as a substrate for assembly of Lys29- and Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains and that its C-terminal domain is both necessary and sufficient for this activity. The N-terminal domain of this E3, which may participate in the recognition of non-Ub substrates, also mediates its binding to 26 S proteasomes. Reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Wild type (Sigma) or Lys29-Ub (see below) was radioiodinated to ∼8,000 cpm/pmol with chloramine T (21Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E1 was purified from bovine erythrocytes (22Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocytes were purchased from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI). Reticulocyte lysate, fraction I, and fraction II were prepared as described (21Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli, U. K., Nature, 227, 1970, 680, 685.Google Scholar). Silver staining was performed as described (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J. A.. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons ,Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion, high pressure liquid chromatography resolution of peptides, and sequencing were done at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility; sequencing was done on an ABI 477A sequencer or by tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ Quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. All PCR-generated plasmid inserts were sequenced. Plasmid pET3a-UbcH5A (25Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) was provided by P. Howley (Harvard Medical School). To generate the GST-UbcH5A expression construct, the UbcH5A coding sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted between theNcoI and BamHI sites of a modified version of pGEX-2TK, called pGEX*, in which NdeI, NcoI, andXhoI sites had been inserted between the kinase phosphorylation site and the BamHI site of pGEX-2TK (26Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To generate the UbcH5A-GST expression construct, the UbcH5A coding sequence was fused in frame with a C-terminal GST moiety by PCR and then inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pET3d (Novagen). To generate the Ub-UbcH5A-GST expression construct, a Ub coding sequence with a Val residue at position 76 and an Ala residue at position 77 was cloned into NcoI-digested pET3d-UbcH5A-GST via blunt end ligation. The KIAA10 cDNA in pBluescript II SK(+) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan) (27Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawarabayasi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). PCR was used to introduce an enterokinase cleavage site (DDDK) in frame with the initiating Met of full-length KIAA10 and the N-terminal domain of KIAA10 (KIAA10ND, representing the first 655 amino acids). The PCR products were subcloned into the NdeI site of pGEX* to generate the GST-EK-KIAA10 and GST-EK-KIAA10ND expression constructs. The C-terminal domain (KIAA10CD; the last 428 residues) of KIAA10 was amplified by PCR and directly cloned into the NdeI site of pGEX* so as to be in frame with a thrombin cleavage site downstream of the GST. To generate vectors for in vitro transcription/translation, the full-length, KIAA10ND, and KIAA10CD coding regions of KIAA10 were amplified by PCR to introduce an NdeI site at either end and ligated into NdeI-digested pET3a. The HUL5 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from a yeast genomic DNA library and cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX*. A set of pET3a plasmids specifying seven mutant Ubs, each one carrying a single lysine residue (other lysines were mutated to arginine via AGA codons) has been described (28You J. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Hodgins R. Gwozd C. Arnason T. Cummings M. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28766-28771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); each Ub is named based on the position of the single lysine residue (e.g., Lys29-Ub has a lysine residue only at position 29; K0-Ub is devoid of lysines). Plasmids (pET3a) specifying des-GlyGly (Ub74) versions of each of these proteins were generated by PCR. Recombinant single lysine Ubs (full-length and Ub74 versions) were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring a helper plasmid, pJY2, that specifies both the AGA-specificargU tRNA and T7 lysozyme. The Ubs were purified as described (28You J. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). UbcH5A, GST-UbcH5A, and UbcH5A-GST were expressed inE. coli strain BL21(DE3)pJY2 at 30 °C as described (20Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were frozen overnight at −20 °C and then thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (26Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using 2 ml of buffer/g of cells. Cell lysis and DNA digestion were carried out as described (26Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min prior to purification of the recombinant protein from the supernatant. In the case of UbcH5A, the supernatant (32 ml, from 2 liters of cell suspension) was passed through a 100-ml Q-Sepharose column that had been preequilibrated with base buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT). The flow-through was loaded onto an 8-ml S-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. This column was washed with 2 column volumes of base buffer and then eluted with 4 column volumes of base buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. The GST-UbcH5A and UbcH5A-GST fusion proteins were purified using GSH-Sepharose (Sigma) and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm GSH. GSH was removed by dialysis against TDE (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). The concentrations of untagged and GST-tagged forms of UbcH5A were estimated based on the concentration of the 125I-Ub thiol ester band, as determined by comparison with the result obtained with a known amount of E2–25K (26Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ub2 synthesis was assayed by combining purified E1 (22Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with recombinant UbcH5A and an E3 source (see figure legends). Assays were initiated with a mix contributing (final concentrations): 50 mm Tris-HCl (24% base, pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP (plus a regenerating system), 0.3 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, ∼0.5 mm DTT, ∼0.1 μm E1, 1 mg/ml Lys29-Ub74, 0.2 μm UbcH5A, and 2 μm125I-Ub (usually Lys29-Ub). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for times ranging from several min to 60 min, quenched with sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Ub2 was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a phosphorimage analyzer. Assays to assess linkage specificity in Ub2 synthesis were carried out in a similar manner, using 1 mg/ml of each single-lysine Ub74 protein. Activity in UbcH5A-dependent Lys29-Ub2synthesis (above) was used to follow the E3 activity during purification. Rabbit reticulocyte fraction II (∼1 g of protein) was loaded onto a 12-ml Ub-Affi-Gel column containing 5 mg Ub/ml resin (22Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins precipitating between 0 and 35% saturation with ammonium sulfate were collected from the flow-through of this column, dialyzed against TDE buffer (above), and fractionated on a 35-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with base buffer (above). The column was eluted sequentially with Base buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m (4 column volumes/fraction). After dialysis against TDE buffer, the peak fraction (0.3 m NaCl) from the Q column was applied to a 5-ml hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mm DTT. After washing with the same buffer, the column was sequentially eluted with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm DTT (4 column volumes/fraction). Each fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the buffer was exchanged by repeated dilution with TDE buffer. The peak fractions (0.1 and 0.2 m phosphate, containing 10 and 5 mg of protein, respectively) were concentrated to 10 ml each. GST-UbcH5A or UbcH5A-GST fusion proteins were bound to GSH-Sepharose (∼1 mg of protein/ml of resin). Each loaded column was washed with 30 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm DTT prior to E3 binding. The UbcH5A-GST∼Ub thiol ester complex was made by incubating 0.1 μm E1, 0.4 mg/ml wild-type Ub, a trace amount I125Ub, an ATP-regenerating system, and UbcH5A-GST resin (1.2 ml, in a total volume of 8 ml) at 37 °C. Thiol ester formation, monitored as the incorporation of 125I-Ub into the settled resin, was complete within 2 h. The thiol ester complex was washed with 24 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.2), and then 0.2m triethanolamine (pH 8.2) was added together with 25 mm dimethylpimelimidate-HCl (Pierce) to stabilize the thiol ester complex by cross-linking. After a 1-h incubation (room temperature), the resin was washed with 0.1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.2) to block any remaining dimethylpimelimidate and then equilibrated with TDE buffer (above). In pilot studies, the E3 peak fraction (0.2 ml of the 0.1 m phosphate fraction) from the hydroxylapatite column (above) was incubated with 1) UbcH5A-GST, 2) GST-UbcH5A, or 3) “Ub∼UbcH5A”-GST fusion proteins immobilized on GSH resin (0.2 mg of fusion protein on 0.2 ml of resin) for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Each slurry was packed into a small column, washed with TDE buffer, and then eluted with TDE buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The eluates were concentrated in 0.5-ml ultrafiltration devices (Millipore Corp.) and desalted by repeated dilution with TDE buffer. Fractions of each affinity column were assayed for Lys29-Ub2 synthesis. Large scale affinity purification was carried out similarly, except that the affinity matrix consisted of recombinant linear Ub-UbcH5A-GST fusion protein immobilized on GSH resin (1 ml of the 0.2 mhydroxylapatite peak, containing ∼0.4 mg of protein, was applied to 1 ml of resin carrying 10 mg of fusion protein). GST-EK-KIAA10, GST-EK-KIAA10ND, and GST-KIAA10CD fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pJY2 cells using the respective expression plasmids (above). All three fusion proteins formed inclusion bodies. Purification and renaturation of the proteins were carried out by a modification of the procedure of Patra et al. (30Patra A.K. Mukhopadhyay R. Mukhiga R. Krishnan A. Garg L.C. Panda A.K. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cell lysis and DNA digestion were done as described above. The lysates were centrifuged at ∼13,000 × g for 10 min to collect the inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were repeatedly washed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40 until an electrophoretic purity of >95% was achieved. The washed inclusion bodies were solubilized in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 12.5) and diluted 10-fold with deionized water, and the solution was adjusted to pH ∼7 by the dropwise addition of 1 n HCl. The GST tags of the fusion proteins were then removed by cleavage with enterokinase (for full-length and KIAA10ND proteins; Novagen) or thrombin (for KIAA10CD protein; U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The full-length KIAA10 protein was purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl-200 column, while the KIAA10CD protein was bound to Q-Sepharose and eluted with a stepwise gradient. Aliquots of the fractions from each column were assayed for Lys29-Ub2 synthesis activity. The peak fractions were pooled and used as the source of E3. For activity assays, the KIAA10ND was separated from GST by binding the latter protein to GSH resin. For binding studies (see below), intact GST fusion proteins were bound to GSH resin and used without further purification. KIAA10CD (1.3 μm) was incubated as in Ub2 synthesis assays (above), except Ub74 was omitted and 125I-Ub was replaced with unlabeled wild-type Ub or K0-Ub (2.4 μm). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, quenched with sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Products were detected by Western blotting with Ub antibodies (28You J. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The GST-KIAA10ND fusion protein (or GST) was immobilized on GSH resin (0.5 mg of protein/ml of resin). A 50-μl aliquot of each resin was equilibrated with 1.5 ml of TDE (above) and then mixed with ∼125 μg of purified 26 S proteasomes (5Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar) or 50 μl of TDE buffer (as negative control). After incubation overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation, the resin was washed with 30 column volumes of TDE and then eluted with 50 μl of sample buffer. Proteasome binding was evaluated by Western blot analysis of the eluates with antibody against the S8/p45 subunit of the 19 S complex (Affiniti Research Products). To analyze the KIAA10-S2 interaction, KIAA10 proteins (full-length, KIAA10ND, and KIAA10CD) were produced by in vitrotranscription/translation in reticulocyte lysate (Promega), using the respective pET3a plasmids and [35S]methionine. A GST-S2 fusion protein was produced in E. coli using a pGEX-S2 plasmid provided by C. Gorbea and M. Rechsteiner (University of Utah). A 10-μl aliquot of each translation mixture was mixed with 10 μl of immobilized GST-S2 or GST (0.5 mg of protein/ml of resin). Binding buffer (0.18 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the resin, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The resin was washed with 0.3 ml of binding buffer and then eluted with 20 μl of sample buffer. An aliquot of each eluate (8 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Because poly-Ub chains are linked via isopeptide bonds, they are accessible only through enzymatic synthesis. Analyses of the signaling properties of noncanonical chains must therefore begin with the identification of enzymes that are capable of novel chain assembly. We previously described an E3 that cooperates with the E2 UbcH5A to catalyze the assembly of both Lys29- and Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains (20Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The abundance of this E3 in rabbit reticulocyte extracts was low, such that the activity could not be assigned to a specific polypeptide even after several conventional chromatographic steps (data not shown) (20Mastrandrea L.D. You J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In pilot studies, we determined a K0.5 of ∼20 nm for UbcH5A in assays of E3-catalyzed poly-Ub chain synthesis (data not shown). From this result, it seemed possible that the E3 might be purified based on its affinity for UbcH5A. UbcH5A was expressed as a fusion to the N terminus or the C terminus of GST (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both purified fusion proteins formed thiol esters with Ub (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 3), but GST-UbcH5A displayed a very low specific activity in the E3 assay (Fig. 1 B, lane 1 versus lane 3). (The assay monitors the conjugation of full-length 125I-Ub to a truncated acceptor, Lys29-Ub74, that carries a single lysine residue at position 29.) In contrast, the specific activity of UbcH5A-GST was similar to that of untagged UbcH5A (Fig.1 B, lane 2 versus lane 3). Based on these results (Fig. 1), we selected the UbcH5A-GST fusion protein as the initial ligand for E3 purification. Inasmuch as the E3 proved to be a HECT domain enzyme (below), our finding that an N-terminal GST moiety interfered with the conjugation activity of UbcH5A is consistent with the crystal structure of the E6-AP HECT-E2 UbcH7 complex, which shows that the N-terminal E2 helix contributes to the HECT domain-E2 interaction (31Huang L.

The UbcH5A-GST fusion protein was immobilized on GSH resin and incubated with the partially purified E3. After washing, UbcH5A-interacting components were eluted with high salt. Some of the E3 activity was recovered in the salt eluate (Fig.2 A, lane 6 versus lane 1), but much of the activity remained in the unbound fractions (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). Although the observed binding was specific (cf. no binding to GST alone; Fig. 2 C,lane 6), it was less efficient than expected from the high affinity of (untagged) UbcH5A for the E3 (see above). Since E3 catalysis involves the E2∼Ub thiol ester, the inefficient binding seen in Fig. 2 A could be explained if the E3 recognizes both the E2 and the Ub that is covalently attached to it. To test this hypothesis, we used E1 to transfer Ub to immobilized UbcH5A-GST, stabilized the thiol ester by cross-linking with dimethylpimelimidate, and used the cross-linked complex as the affinity ligand (see “Experimental Procedures”). Relative to the unliganded E2, the cross-linked E2-Ub complex bound the E3 more efficiently (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 3 in B versus A), although the r"

The affinity of FadR for DNA is controlled by long chain acyl-CoA molecules, which bind to the protein and modulate gene expression. The crystal structure of FadR reveals a two domain dimeric molecule where the N-terminal domains bind DNA, and the C-terminal domains bind acyl-CoA.

The FadR·DNA complex reveals how the protein interacts with DNA and specifically recognizes a palindromic sequence. Structural and functional similarities to the Tet repressor and the BmrR transcription factors suggest how the binding of the acyl-CoA effector molecule to the C-terminal domain may affect the DNA binding affinity of the N-terminal domain. We suggest that the binding of acyl-CoA disrupts a buried network of charged and polar residues in the C-terminal domain, and the resulting conformational change is transmitted to the N-terminal domain via a domain-spanning α-helix.1HW1 1HW2 In Escherichia coli, the expression of fatty acid metabolic genes is controlled by the transcription factor, FadR.

Rock C.O. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar). Fatty acids are vital constituents of the cell membranes, but they also represent a source of energy. Thus, fatty acid degradative and biosynthetic metabolic pathways must be switched on and off based on the availability of extracellular fatty acids. In E. coli, the transcription factor, FadR, functions as a switch that coordinately regulates the machinery required for fatty acid β-oxidation and the expression of a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis (2Cronan Jr., J.E. Subrahmanyam S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3DiRusso C.C. Nyström T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has been known for some time that the enzymes responsible for fatty acid degradation in E. coli are inducible, and the isolation of regulatory mutants, fadR, suggested the existence of a single repressor that controlled the entire set of degradative (fad) genes (4Overath P. Raufuss E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J.

Mutagenesis studies identified thefadR gene and verified that this single repressor controls the transcription of the whole fad regulon (7Simons R.W. Egan P.A. Chute H.T. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 621-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Simons R.W. Hughes K.T. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 726-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the cloning (9DiRusso C.C. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and sequencing (10DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) of the fadR gene, it was predicted that FadR contains a HTH1 motif, which is consistent with its proposed function as a DNA-binding protein. Thefad genes are only induced in the presence of long-chain fatty acids, suggesting that FadR is a classical bacterial repressor. Thus, in the absence of fatty acids, the protein binds at a site downstream of the promoters of the fad genes and represses transcription. When long chain fatty acids become available, they are converted to CoA thioesters, bind to FadR, and elicit a conformational change that releases the protein from DNA, thereby removing the repression. Subsequent studies on the fadB gene (11DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed this general outline and revealed that the FadR DNA binding site in fadB is close to the +1 region relative to the start site of transcription. The subsequent observation that fadR mutants were also defective in unsaturated fatty acid production (12Nunn W.D. Giffin K. Clark D. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 554-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) led to the important discovery that FadR is also a transcriptional activator (13Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,14Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Specifically, it controls the expression of the fabAgene that encodes the enzyme FabA, which introduces double bonds into the growing acyl chain (13Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Analysis of the fabA gene revealed a canonical FadR binding site in the −40 region of the promoter where positive activators of the ς70 factor typically bind. Thus, the role of FadR as a repressor or an activator depends on the location of its binding site within the promoter. When bound downstream of the RNA polymerase binding site of thefad promoters, it blocks the polymerase and acts as a repressor. However, when bound close to the −40 region, it promotes the binding of the RNA polymerase. A number of FadR binding sites have now been characterized, and all conform to this straightforward model (15DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of FadR at the molecular level, we have performed a crystallographic analysis of the protein. Here we report the structure of the FadR dimer at 1.5 Å in the absence of bound DNA and long chain acyl-CoA thioesters, and also the structure of the FadR·DNA complex at 3.25 Å. The crystal structure of FadR in the absence of DNA has recently been determined independently at 2.0 Å resolution (16van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and therefore the emphasis of this report is how FadR interacts with DNA. Structural homologies to other transcription factors provide important clues as to how ligand binding controls the DNA affinity. The fadR open reading frame (GenBankTM/EBI accession X08087) was amplified fromE. coli strain UB1005 in a polymerase chain reaction using the primers fadr-Nco (5′-CCATGGTCATTAAGGCGCAAAGC) and fadr-Bam (5′-GGATCCTTATCGCCCCTGAATGGC), and was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Following transformation into INVα F' (Invitrogen), a plasmid with the correct sequence was isolated, and the gene was released by digestion with NcoI and BamHI. This fragment was ligated into similarly digested pET-15b (Novagen) to create pPJ139 for expression of full-length FadR. Plasmids were transformed into B834(DE3) (Novagen) for expression. To produce FadR containing selenomethionine ([SeMet]FadR), the cells were resuspended in minimal medium containing selenomethionine (0.05 g/liter; Sigma) immediately prior to induction. This method is fully described elsewhere (17Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Generally, the level of FadR expression was greater than 20% of the soluble cell protein. Native FadR was purified by tandem anion and cation ion-exchange chromatography essentially as described previously (11DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [SeMet]FadR did not bind to cation-exchange resins, and the following alternative purification method was developed. Cells from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in buffer A (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed in a French pressure cell at 16,000 psi. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was directly applied to a 30 ml DE52 column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The fractions containing FadR were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and pooled. The pooled fractions were concentrated with an Amicon stirred cell and applied to a Sephacryl S200 gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. FadR eluted as a single peak at a position consistent with a dimer and was essentially pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gels. FadR in the absence of bound DNA was crystallized using the hanging drop procedure at 18 °C by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution at 10 mg/ml with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.7m ammonium sulfate, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, and 5 mm zinc chloride. Although crystals grew from ammonium sulfate or lithium sulfate alone, a mixture of the two gave the best crystals. [SeMet]FadR crystallized in the same condition, but without zinc chloride. Crystals typically grew within 2 weeks and were in space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 59.4 Å, b = 87.0 Å, c = 59.1 Å, andβ = 120.2°. There is one dimer in the asymmetric unit. To prepare the FadR·DNA complex, the oligonucleotides, 5′-CGATCTGGTCCGACCAGATGCT-3′ and 5′-GCATCTGGTCGGACCAGATCGA-3′, were dissolved in buffer A, annealed, and mixed with FadR at a protein/DNA molar ratio of 1:3. Crystals of the complex were also obtained by the hanging drop method at 18 °C by mixing equal volumes of 8 mg/ml complex solution with a reservoir solution containing 10% isopropyl alcohol, 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 10 mmMgCl2. Crystals grew in 1 month and were in space group P212121 with the cell dimensionsa = 83.7 Å, b = 110.1 Å, andc = 130.2 Å. There is one dimer complex in the asymmetric unit. All diffraction data used in these studies were collected at the Structural Biology Center (SBC) beamline 19ID at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago. Data were recorded on a 3 × 3 CCD detector from crystals flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at 100 K. MAD data were collected from Se-Met-labeled crystals that were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose. The peak, inflection point and high energy remote wavelengths were determined from an x-ray fluorescence spectrum collected from the mounted crystal, and 360° of data were collected at each wavelength in two 180° sweeps. The 1.5 Å native dataset was collected from an unlabeled frozen crystal that was also cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. Data were collected from a frozen FadR·DNA complex crystal that was cryoprotected in 20% MPD. Integration, scaling, and merging of data were performed with the program HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The FadR structure in the absence of DNA was determined directly from the MAD data. All Patterson search, MAD phasing, electron density map calculations, and density modification procedures were carried out using the CNS program suite (19Brünger A.T. Admas P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Four selenium atoms were identified at equivalent locations in the unit cell from each of the three MAD datasets. These initial positions were refined and then used in a MAD phasing calculation at 1.7 Å resolution. The experimental electron density map was of high quality, but density modification produced a greatly improved and easily interpretable map at 1.7 Å resolution. A model was built into the density using the O program (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), and refined against the MAD remote data using simulated-annealing, positional, and individual B-factor refinement. The partially refined model was then further refined in the same manner against the superior quality 1.5 Å resolution native data. The final model includes residues 5–230 in each monomer, 416 water molecules, 6 sulfate ions, and 1 zinc ion located on the local molecular 2-fold axis. 95.5% of residues are in the core regions of a Ramachandran plot performed in PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. Marcarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and only the two glutamine residues at position 6 in the dimer are in forbidden regions. The structure of the FadR·DNA complex was solved with molecular replacement methods using AMoRe (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The 1.5 Å resolution native FadR dimer was used as a search model. After rigid body refinement performed in AMoRe, the R-factor was 45.5% with a correlation coefficient of 0.505 calculated with data between 10.0 and 3.2 Å resolution. A preliminary model of the bound DNA molecule was built into the visible density, and the structure was improved iteratively with successive rounds of model building using the O program (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) and refinement using CNS (19Brünger A.T. Admas P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Only grouped B-factor refinement was applied. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied during the early stages of refinement and later removed. The final model contains one FadR dimer (residues 7 to 228), one DNA duplex, and one magnesium ion. The MAD technique, using metabolically incorporated selenomethionine, was used to solve the FadR structure. The selenium positions were identified using automated Patterson search methods, and phasing was carried out to the resolution limit of the MAD data (1.7 Å). The data collection and phasing statistics are shown in Table I. The electron density map after density modification was of superb quality, and the complete FadR molecule was visible apart from four residues at the N terminus and nine residues at the C terminus. Refinement by simulated annealing was performed against a native dataset that extended to 1.5 Å resolution. The refinement statistics and model quality parameters are listed in TableII.Table ICrystallographic data and phasing statistics for the FadR structure analysisParametersnativeSe remoteSe peakSe inflectionFadR/DNAResolution (Å)40–1.540–1.740–1.740–1.740–3.2Wavelength (Å)0.95372λ1 = 0.95372λ2 = 0.97834λ3 = 0.979560.95372Total reflections1306223123896611092351242866643902Unique reflections8065856641563485648120310Completeness (%)97.2/78.998.2/96.898.1/96.698.1/96.699.2/99.6Rmerge(%) 1-aRmerge = ΣΣ‖Ii − Im‖/ΣΣ Ii where Iiis the intensity of the measured reflection and Im is the mean intensity of all symmetry-related reflections.6.7/18.04.1/24.84.3/16.44.7/20.37.2/34.6I/ς7.811.213.012.48.7MAD phasingphasing power 1-bPhasing power = FH/ERMS.RCULLIS1-cRCULLIS = Σ‖ ‖FPH ± FP‖−FH(calc)‖/Σ‖FPH± FP‖.RKRAUT1-dRKRAUT = Σ‖ ‖FPH‖ − ‖FP + FH(calc)‖ ‖/Σ‖FPH‖.

DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, it can be divided into three regions, an α/β N-terminal domain (α1-β1-α2-α3-β2-β3), an α-helical C-terminal domain (α6-α7-α8-α9-α10-α11-α12), and a linker comprising two short α-helices (α4-α5). The two major domains only interact via the linker region, and the overall shape of the monomer therefore resembles a dumbbell. The structure of the N-terminal domain conforms to the so-called winged-helix motif (23Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), consistent with its role in binding DNA. The larger C-terminal domain is essentially an antiparallel array of six α-helices that form a barrel-like structure, with a seventh α-helix (α10) forming a lid at the end closest to the N-terminal domain. FadR forms a dimeric structure in the crystal, which is consistent with independent studies showing a dimer to be the functional state of the protein in solution (24Raman N. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The monomers are packed together in a parallel fashion, and the two domains and the linker regions make reciprocal interactions across the interface. The monomers are tightly wrapped, and ∼1600 Å2 of surface area are buried in forming the dimer. A region of tetrahedral electron density on the local 2-fold axis was interpreted as a zinc atom coordinated to two water molecules and the Oδ1 atoms of asparagines 81 and 81′ (the prime refers to the second monomer in the dimer structure). Although zinc ions were not required to grow crystals of FadR, they were essential to obtain the highest resolution crystals from which the 1.5 Å native dataset was collected. Known protein structures with homology to FadR were identified using the Dali search engine (25Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 2: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the N- and C-terminal domains were submitted separately. As noted earlier, the N-terminal domain shows clear homology to the winged-helix motif (23Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and the Dali search identified CAP (26Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) as the most similar winged-helix transcription factor. A number of proteins were shown to have similar helical arrangements to the FadR C-terminal domain within their structures, for example ATP synthase, myosin, and serum albumin, but the most intriguing was the C-terminal domain of the tetracycline (Tet) repressor (27Orth P. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Saenger W. Hinrichs W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Like FadR, the Tet repressor contains a regulatory C-terminal domain that recognizes a specific ligand (tetracycline), which, in turn, mediates its ability to bind cognate DNA (28Betrand K.P. Postle K. Wray Jr., L.V. Reznikoff W.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 23: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the FadR, CAP, and Tet repressor domains in equivalent orientations to highlight their similarities. Based on sequence alignment, it was previously suggested that FadR might be homologous to the GntR family of transcription factors (16van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,29Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 79: 291-296Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the sequence homology is marginal, and there are no structures of any of the GntR family members to confirm this suggested relationship. We consider that the homologies to CAP and the Tet repressor based on structure are more relevant. Therefore, in terms of structural genomics, FadR can be categorized as a chimera of two motifs that have previously been characterized, the winged-helix motif and the C-terminal domain of the Tet repressor. The structure of the FadR·DNA complex was determined by molecular replacement using the dimer as the search model. Phases from the molecular replacement solution produced an electron density map in which the sugar-phosphate backbone of the bound DNA was clearly visible. Iterative rounds of model building and refinement generated the final structure. Because the FadR·DNA complex is the asymmetric unit in the crystal, non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were incorporated into the early rounds of refinement, but these were relaxed in the final rounds. Also, to guard against model bias, a number of simulated annealing omit maps were calculated during refinement in which regions at the protein-DNA interface were removed from the model. A representative region of the final electron density map is shown in Fig.2 A, and the pertinent statistics of the final model are listed in Table II. The complete structure of the FadR·DNA complex is shown in Fig.2 B. The conformation of the FadR dimer in the complex is virtually identical with that in the absence of bound DNA. The RMSD on alpha carbons is 0.717 Å. All of the duplex DNA is visible in the electron density map apart from the overhanging ends. In the crystal, the ends of the DNA interact with the C-terminal domains of neighboring FadR molecules, and the 5′-cytosine of one chain is flipped out of the duplex to form one of these interactions (Fig. 2 B). Apart from the central G(11)-C(11′) base pair, the DNA in the complex is palindromic, and the pseudo 2-fold axis is coincident with the local 2-fold axis of FadR, with the major groove facing the protein and the minor groove facing away from the protein. The result is that each N-terminal domain interacts in an identical fashion with its DNA half-site. The DNA has a B-form conformation with a curvature of 20° toward the protein, and this results in a contraction of the central major groove and an expansion of the opposite minor groove. The gross features of the B-form helix are recognized by the two N termini of the paired α3 helices that project orthogonally into the central major groove and the two β-ribbon wings that dock into the flanking minor grooves. A detailed view of the FadR-DNA interface is shown in Fig.3 A, and only one monomer is presented, because both half-sites are identical. The interactions that determine the specificity are shown diagrammatically in Fig.3 B. Although there are a number of nonspecific interactions with the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, only three adjacent base pairs are formally recognized within the complex, T/A (6/16′), G/C (7/15′) and G/C (8/14′). These interact with His-65, and arginines 35 and 45 respectively, which are invariant in the three known sequences of FadR (16van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). His-65 is at the very tip of the wing and is buried deep in the minor groove where the Nε2 nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with N3 of A16. The guanidinium groups of arginines 35 and 45 are hydrogen-bonded to the O6 and N7 atoms of G7 and G8 in the major groove. Other conserved residues in the complex include Arg-49, that forms a salt bridge interaction with the phosphate group of G8, and threonines 44, 46, and 47 at the N terminus of helix α3 that interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone. Finally, glutamic acids 34 and 50′ appear to be key residues, because they form electrostatic interactions with, and presumably stabilize the positions of, arginines 35, 45, and 49. The structure of the FadR·DNA complex provides a firm basis for understanding how this transcription factor controls the expression of bacterial fatty acid metabolic genes. A key finding is that the N-terminal winged-helix motif does not bind DNA in the classical manner. The structures of several protein-DNA complexes involving winged-helix motifs have now been determined (23Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and, typically, the second recognition helix in the HTH region binds along the DNA major groove, and the β-ribbon binds within the adjacent minor groove. However, the precise details of the interaction can vary (23Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 30Gajiwala K.S. Chen H. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Reith W. Mach B. Burley S.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and FadR is unusual because only the N terminus of the α3 recognition helix is within the major groove. The most similar example to the FadR variation is found in CAP (26Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), although, unlike CAP, FadR does not induce a sharp 90° bend in the DNA. It is therefore not surprising that the FadR and CAP winged-helix domains are structurally very similar. The way in which FadR binds DNA is determined by the location of the α3 recognition helices that are paired together at the dimer interface. The FadR dimer cannot bind DNA with the α3 helices along the major groove unless the N-terminal domains move apart to expose the surfaces of these helices. This was implied in a model of the complex based on the apo-FadR structure (16van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but we can now confirm that the N-terminal domains continue to interact via their α3 helices in the FadR·DNA complex. The oligonucleotide that was used to produce crystals of the FadR·DNA complex was based on the highest affinity cognate sequence that is found within the fadB promoter (11DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure reveals that only three residues (Arg-35, Arg-45, and His-65) formally recognize this sequence, and FadR appears to have specificity for the palindromic consensus sequence 5′-TGGNNNNNCCA-3′. It is clear why the two G/C base pairs in each half-site are important specificity elements in the complex (Fig. 3). Both are involved in specific and identical Arg/G/C triple interactions, and the adjacent triples are able to form a stable stacked configuration within the half-site. The specificity for the flanking T/A base pairs in the minor groove is probably related to the close approach of the wing and the sidechain of His-65, which is facilitated by the lack of a sidechain on the adjacent and conserved Gly-66. A G/C base pair in this position would introduce an amine group into the minor groove (N2 from the guanine), and the close approach would be compromised. Finally, the five central spacer elements are necessary to match the architecture of the dimeric N-terminal domains and the resulting distances between the 2-fold related specificity elements. The consensus sequence based on our structure is supported by binding data on other cognate sequences where deviations generally reduce the affinity (15DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the conservation within these sequences also suggests that a better consensus is 5′-TGGTNNNACCA-3′, and this is consistent with independent in vitro selection studies on the FadR binding site within the iclR promoter (31Gui L. Sunnarborg A. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4704-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inner T/A base pair is present in the oligonucleotide used in this study, and a specific interaction is feasible with Arg-49 that is adjacent in the complex. However, this is not supported by our structure in which Arg-49 forms a salt bridge with Glu-50′. Studies both in vitroand in vivo have revealed that long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters are the actual ligands that control the DNA binding affinity of FadR, and that they interact directly and reversibly with a specific region of the C-terminal domain (14Henry M.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Raman N. Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol.

Tsvetnitsky V. Hojrup P. Knudsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33652-33659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on the functionally and structurally related Tet repressor that has been fully characterized by crystallographic studies (27Orth P. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Saenger W. Hinrichs W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), we can predict that the interaction results in a conformational change that affects the structure, and hence the DNA binding affinity, of the N-terminal domain. In the Tet repressor, ligand binding within the C-terminal domain causes the movement of an α-helix that connects to, and also forms part of, the N-terminal domain (27Orth P. Schnappinger D. Hillen W. Saenger W. Hinrichs W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In the paired N-terminal domains, the result of this movement is that the two DNA binding helices are no longer able to bind in the major groove. Therefore, the connecting α-helix essentially represents a mechanism for communicating structural changes from the regulatory domain to the DNA binding domain. By analogy, to establish how the FadR switching mechanism operates, it is necessary to understand the nature of the ligand-induced conformational change, the interdomain communication mechanism, and the resulting effects on the N-terminal domain. Mutagenesis experiments have identified Gly-216, Glu-218, Ser-219, Trp-223, and Lys-228 within helix α12 as components of the acyl-CoA binding site. Also, affinity labeling experiments with a palmitoyl-CoA analog tagged the peptide 187–195 in the adjacent helix α11 (32Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The interior of the C-terminal domain contains an unusual cluster of aromatic, charged, and polar residues, which is directly adjacent to these putative acyl-CoA binding regions. The cluster is composed of tyrosines 172, 193, and 215, Arg-105, Thr-106, Asp-145, and Ser-219, and it is knitted together by a lattice of hydrogen-bonding interactions that involves five buried water molecules (Fig.4 A). This lattice links together five of the seven surrounding α-helices including α11 and α12, and we suggest the binding of acyl-CoA disrupts this lattice and produces a large conformational change within the C-terminal domain. This suggestion is based on structural studies of the BmrR transcription factor, which controls the expression of the Bmr multidrug-efflux transporter in Bacillus subtilis (35Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The C-terminal sensor domain of BmrR contains a similar buried cluster composed of three tyrosines and a glutamic acid, which forms part of the binding site for aromatic/hydrophobic cationic drugs. The structure of the drug-bound complex showed that the aromatic ligand accesses this buried array and induces a large conformational change in the sensor domain. As regards the interdomain communication mechanism, helix α5 in the linker region appears to be a key component, because it has extensive and conserved hydrophobic interfaces with the two flanking domains (Fig. 4 B). Specifically, leucines 86 and 89, and Ile-82 interact with the N-terminal domain, and leucines 80 and 83, and Ala-87 interact with the C-terminal domain. The interface with the N-terminal domain is also characterized by a conserved cluster of aromatic residues comprising tryptophans 21, 60, and 75, and Phe-74. Therefore, helix α5 may have a similar role to the equivalent domain-spanning helix of the Tet repressor. Unfortunately, the BmrR structural studies do not provide clues as to how the conformational change in the sensor domain modulates DNA affinity because the DNA binding domain is missing (35Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). One scenario for FadR is that the interface between the α3 helices is broken by movements in the C-terminal domain, and this leads to a disruption of the precise DNA binding architecture of the N-terminal domain dimer. This is plausible because the interface between the N-terminal domains is only mediated by the paired α3 helices, and the interactions are exclusively ionic and polar (Fig.4 B). The 2-fold related arrays of interacting amino acids comprise arginines 49, 54′, and 57, Glu-50′, Gln-53, and Asp-58′. Glu-13 from helix α1 is the only other residue within FadR that contributes to this interface. Thus, a separation of the N-terminal domains would not be structurally unfavorable, because it would only result in the exposure of two hydrophilic surfaces. We are particularly grateful to Rongguang Zhang and the rest of the SBC staff at the APS for help in collecting and processing the diffraction data. We also thank Hee-Won Park for invaluable help, and Suzanne Jackowski and Allen Price for insights and discussions.

Ent-kaurene diterpenes are intermediates of the synthesis of gibberellins and inhibit the expression of NO synthase-2 and the release of tumor necrosis factor-α in J774 macrophages challenged with lipopolysaccharide.

NF-κB is present constitutively in the cytosol of the cells, where it is retained through the interaction with inhibitory IκB proteins that mask the nuclear localization domain of the complex (2Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). NF-κB-dependent gene transcription requires the phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK2, which releases this inhibitory component from the dimer of Rel proteins (mainly p50, p65, and c-Rel), and is followed by degradation of the phospho-IκB by the proteasome (3Ghosh S.

For this reason, the research on molecules endowed with the capacity to inhibit the consecutive steps leading to NF-κB activation has been a subject of current interest (2Baeuerle P.A.

In this regard, among the natural products assayed, various terpenoids have been described as potent inhibitors of NF-κB activation in response to proinflammatory stimulation. Andalusol, a labdane diterpene from Sideritis exerted anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting NF-κB activation (8de las Heras B. Navarro A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Bermejo P. Castrillo A. Bosca L. Villar A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Navarro A. de las Heras B. Villar A.M. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C J. Biosci. 1997; 52: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Triterpenes also inhibited NOS-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells (IC50, 0.2–0.3 μm) and impaired NF-κB activity (10Dirsch V.M. Kiemer A.K. Wagner H. Vollmar A.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 336: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the case of sesquiterpenes, it has been described that some of these compounds induce HSP72, which in turn prevents NF-κB activation and NOS-2 expression (11Matsuda H. Kagerura T. Toguchida I. Ueda H. Morikawa T. Yoshikawa M. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Matsuda H. Kagerurd T. Toguchida I. Murakami T. Kishi A. Yoshikawa M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 3081-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).More recently, attention has been paid to the study of the biological effects of tetracyclic ent-kaurene diterpenes, because the number of these molecules isolated and characterized is continuously increasing (13Tudzynski B. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 52: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Yamaguchi S. Kamiya Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Ent-kaurene is the main diterpene intermediate involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellins, a widespread family of plant hormones with isoprenoid structure that control various physiological plant functions such as growth, germination, and flowering (15Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Some kaurenes exhibit cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines such as HL-60, K562, and MKN-28 (16Hou A.J. Li M.L. Jiang B. Lin Z.W. Ji S.Y. Zhou Y.P. Sun H.D. J. Nat. Prod.

Planta Med. 1999; 65: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication in vitro (19Chen K. Shi Q. Fujioka T. Nakano T. Hu C.Q. Jin J.Q. Kilkuskie R.E. Lee K.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1345-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have compared a series of kaurene and clerodane diterpenes as likely candidates to modulate NF-κB activity. Clerodanes were used because these diterpenes, with lactone and epoxy groups adjacent to ring A, offer the possibility of performing Michael addition reactions, and recent work has indicated that this mechanism is important in the physiological inhibition of IKK and NF-κB activities by cyclopentenone prostaglandins (20Negishi M. Koizumi T. Ichikawa A. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Our data show that molecules based on the kaurene structure potently inhibit NF-κB activation by interfering with steps preceding IKK, presumably NIK activity. In addition to this, kaurenes delayed the activation of ERK1 and 2 and p38 MAPK, but not that of JNK, suggesting that the alteration in the coordinate temporal sequence of events triggered after LPS activation plays an important role in the transient activation of NF-κB.DISCUSSIONIn this work we have analyzed the effect of ent-kaurene diterpenes on the activation of NF-κB in LPS-treated J774 macrophages. The action of these compounds was compared with that of teucrine (compound 3) and related clerodane diterpenes possessing α/β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that offer the possibility of reacting with nucleophiles, such as cysteines, by means of Michael-type addition (9Navarro A. de las Heras B.

In this regard, it has been shown that physiological anti-inflammatory molecules, such as the cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2, efficiently inhibit IKK activity and the interaction of the p65 subunit of NF-κB with DNA κB motifs via formation of Michael addition derivatives on key cysteine residues (21Rossi A.

However, in all the experiments performed in this work the clerodanes were unable to modify the inflammatory response to LPS, suggesting that these molecules cannot access the cysteines relevant for the biological function of key proteins.Our data show that kaurene diterpenes inhibit NF-κB activation through a mechanism that involves an impairment of IKK activity, without any direct effect on the binding of the NF-κB complex to the κB motif or on the phosphorylation and targeting of the IKK substrate IκBα. Interestingly, the activity of the IKK complex, which constitutes a common point for the regulation of the pathway (7Karin M. J. Biol.

The effect on steps upstream of IKK of the diterpenes used in this work was analyzed, taking advantage of the fact that transient expression of NIK was sufficient for the activation of IKK and therefore of NF-κB (15Malinin N.L.

Under these conditions, kaurenes persistently inhibited ∼50% of NF-κB activity as deduced from cells co-transfected with NIK and (κB)3ConA.Luc plasmids, although IKK activity was more inhibited by kaurenes (>75%). Because the effect of kaurenes on NF-κB activity was more potent in intact cells treated with LPS than after NIK overexpression, it might be suggested that other pathways activated in response to LPS (in particular members of the MAPK family), also affected by these diterpenes, participate in the overall activation of NF-κB (48van der Bruggen T. Nijenhuis S. van Raaij E. Verhoef J. van Asbeck B.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3824-3829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NIK can be considered as a member of the MAPK kinase superfamily and, indeed, it was originally described as a MAP3K-related kinase (15Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Both NIK and MEK kinase 1, a MAPK kinase, act as shuttle kinases relaying the signaling from the membrane to the high molecular weight IKK complex (30Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Baumann B. Weber C.K. Troppmair J. Whiteside S. Israel A. Rapp U.R. Wirth T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4615-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NIK and MEK kinase 1 can phosphorylate IKK1 and IKK2 with some specificity; whereas MEK kinase 1 preferentially phosphorylates IKK2, NIK can act over both IKKs (30Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

According to this mechanism of activation, it has been proposed that depending on the MAPK kinase present in the IKK complex, the cell specifically responds to inflammatory (NIK) or mitogenic stimulation (MEK kinase 1). In the context of inflammation, the inhibition of NIK by kaurenes allows a deactivation of the signaling mediated through Traf2 and Traf6, the adapter molecules that activate NF-κB via NIK, in response to stimuli using the p75 TNF-α receptor and the Il-1β receptor, respectively (15Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 53Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), suggesting their action as general anti-inflammatory molecules.In addition to the effect of kaurenes on NIK, the activation by LPS of p38 and ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs, but not that of JNK, was notably delayed in cells treated with these diterpenes, although the activity recovered at later periods of time. These results suggest that the loss of efficiency in the signaling coming from the MAPK pathway might contribute, at least in part, to the impairment of IKK activity. Indeed, the coordinate activation of p38 and ERK appears to be critical for the inflammatory response and for the activation of NF-κB (2Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 50Zhao Q. Lee F.S. J. Biol.

Cancer Lett. 2000; 156: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For example, LPS promotes TNF-α expression through the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/MAPK pathway in macrophages, and constitutively active forms of Raf-1 increase notably, although they cannot replace, the requirements of LPS (31Geppert T.D. Whitehurst C.E. Thompson P. Beutler B. Mol. Med. 1994; 1: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48van der Bruggen T. Nijenhuis S. van Raaij E. Verhoef J. van Asbeck B.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3824-3829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the selective inhibition of ERK1 and ERK2 with PD-098059 was sufficient to abolish TNF-α synthesis by human monocytes in response to LPS (48van der Bruggen T. Nijenhuis S. van Raaij E. Verhoef J. van Asbeck B.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3824-3829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, kaurenes were very efficient at inhibiting TNF-α secretion by J774 cells activated with LPS, at least for 24 h, which reflects the persistent inhibition of the pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that the lack of ERK and p38 phosphorylation at appropriate times notably reduces the engagement of subsequent signaling pathways involved in the full activation of NF-κB in response to LPS.The ability of diterpenes to increase the exposure of CD14 was unexpected. Indeed, one possibility for their mechanism of action was a direct interaction with the membrane receptor, but this appears not to be the case, in view of the absence of alteration of JNK activation (28Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the exposure of CD11b, which was used as a marker of differentiation and as a control for the studies on CD14 modulation, exhibited an opposite behavior, with a reduction in the binding when the concentration of the diterpenes increased. Interestingly, aspirin and heparin have been described as molecules that decrease the exposure of CD11b and other adhesion molecules in monocyte/macrophages, involving the inhibition of ERK (42Pillinger M.H. Capodici C. Rosenthal P. Kheterpal N. Hanft S. Philips M.R. Weissmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14540-14545Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 56Peter K. Schwarz M. Conradt C. Nordt T. Moser M. Kubler W. Bode C. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Many terpenes, including diterpenes, triterpenes, and sesquiterpenes have proved to possess anti-inflammatory activity both in vivo and in vitro, and most of them inhibited NF-κB activity, although the precise mechanisms of action have not been fully characterized. In the case of kaurenes we have identified relevant targets for this inhibition, showing that the inhibition of NIK and the lack of a coordinate activation of p38 and/or ERK1 and ERK2 lead to the abrogation of the inflammatory response, in particular, of genes depending on NF-κB activation. The fact that kaurenes are intermediates in the biosynthesis of plant hormones, such as gibberellins, offers the possibility of envisaging further analysis of the interaction of these molecules in several aspects of mammalian cell biology. Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB1 has been shown to be a key component of innate immunity (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar), promoting the expression by macrophages of a set of genes involved in host defense, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines (2Baeuerle P.A.

NF-κB is present constitutively in the cytosol of the cells, where it is retained through the interaction with inhibitory IκB proteins that mask the nuclear localization domain of the complex (2Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). NF-κB-dependent gene transcription requires the phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK2, which releases this inhibitory component from the dimer of Rel proteins (mainly p50, p65, and c-Rel), and is followed by degradation of the phospho-IκB by the proteasome (3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar, 7Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic data indicate that the control of NF-κB activation constitutes a relevant target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases (2Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). For this reason, the research on molecules endowed with the capacity to inhibit the consecutive steps leading to NF-κB activation has been a subject of current interest (2Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). In this regard, among the natural products assayed, various terpenoids have been described as potent inhibitors of NF-κB activation in response to proinflammatory stimulation. Andalusol, a labdane diterpene from Sideritis exerted anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting NF-κB activation (8de las Heras B. Navarro A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Bermejo P. Castrillo A. Bosca L. Villar A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Navarro A. de las Heras B. Villar A.M. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C J. Biosci. 1997; 52: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Triterpenes also inhibited NOS-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells (IC50, 0.2–0.3 μm) and impaired NF-κB activity (10Dirsch V.M. Kiemer A.K. Wagner H. Vollmar A.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 336: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the case of sesquiterpenes, it has been described that some of these compounds induce HSP72, which in turn prevents NF-κB activation and NOS-2 expression (11Matsuda H. Kagerura T. Toguchida I. Ueda H. Morikawa T. Yoshikawa M. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Matsuda H. Kagerurd T. Toguchida I. Murakami T. Kishi A. Yoshikawa M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 3081-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More recently, attention has been paid to the study of the biological effects of tetracyclic ent-kaurene diterpenes, because the number of these molecules isolated and characterized is continuously increasing (13Tudzynski B. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 52: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Yamaguchi S. Kamiya Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Ent-kaurene is the main diterpene intermediate involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellins, a widespread family of plant hormones with isoprenoid structure that control various physiological plant functions such as growth, germination, and flowering (15Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Some kaurenes exhibit cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines such as HL-60, K562, and MKN-28 (16Hou A.J. Li M.L. Jiang B. Lin Z.W. Ji S.Y. Zhou Y.P. Sun H.D. J. Nat. Prod.

( Lloydia ). 1999; 62: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas others exert trypanosomidal activity (18Batista R. Chiari E. de Oliveira A.B. Planta Med. 1999; 65: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication in vitro (19Chen K. Shi Q. Fujioka T. Nakano T. Hu C.Q. Jin J.Q. Kilkuskie R.E. Lee K.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1345-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have compared a series of kaurene and clerodane diterpenes as likely candidates to modulate NF-κB activity. Clerodanes were used because these diterpenes, with lactone and epoxy groups adjacent to ring A, offer the possibility of performing Michael addition reactions, and recent work has indicated that this mechanism is important in the physiological inhibition of IKK and NF-κB activities by cyclopentenone prostaglandins (20Negishi M. Koizumi T. Ichikawa A. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Our data show that molecules based on the kaurene structure potently inhibit NF-κB activation by interfering with steps preceding IKK, presumably NIK activity. In addition to this, kaurenes delayed the activation of ERK1 and 2 and p38 MAPK, but not that of JNK, suggesting that the alteration in the coordinate temporal sequence of events triggered after LPS activation plays an important role in the transient activation of NF-κB. DISCUSSIONIn this work we have analyzed the effect of ent-kaurene diterpenes on the activation of NF-κB in LPS-treated J774 macrophages. The action of these compounds was compared with that of teucrine (compound 3) and related clerodane diterpenes possessing α/β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that offer the possibility of reacting with nucleophiles, such as cysteines, by means of Michael-type addition (9Navarro A. de las Heras B.

https://openalex.org/W1918945878,"Aurodox is a member of the family of kirromycin antibiotics, which inhibit protein biosynthesis by binding to elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). We have determined the crystal structure of the 1:1:1 complex of Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu with GDP and aurodox to 2.0-Å resolution. During its catalytic cycle, EF-Tu adopts two strikingly different conformations depending on the nucleotide bound: the GDP form and the GTP form. In the present structure, a GTP complex-like conformation of EF-Tu is observed, although GDP is bound to the nucleotide-binding site. This is consistent with previous proposals that aurodox fixes EF-Tu on the ribosome by locking it in its GTP form. Binding of EF-Tu·GDP to aminoacyl-tRNA and mutually exclusive binding of kirromycin and elongation factor Ts to EF-Tu can be explained on the basis of the structure. For many previously observed mutations that provide resistance to kirromycin, it can now be understood how they prevent interaction with the antibiotic. An unexpected feature of the structure is the reorientation of the His-85 side chain toward the nucleotide-binding site. We propose that this residue stabilizes the transition state of GTP hydrolysis, explaining the acceleration of the reaction by kirromycin-type antibiotics.1HA3 Aurodox is a member of the family of kirromycin antibiotics, which inhibit protein biosynthesis by binding to elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu).

Sander G. Top. Antibiot. Chem. 1980; 5: 165-221Google Scholar, 2Parmeggiani A. Swart G.W.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 39: 557-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In all aspects investigated, aurodox (Fig. 1) shows identical effects to the more thoroughly studied kirromycin (3Chinali G. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1981; 34: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These antibiotics have been shown to interfere with the role of bacterial elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu)1 in protein biosynthesis (4Wolf H. Chinali G. Parmeggiani A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4910-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). EF-Tu is a vital component of the protein biosynthesis machinery. In its active GTP complex, the 44-kDa protein binds aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) and delivers it to the A site of the messenger RNA-programmed ribosome. Upon codon/anticodon interaction, GTP is hydrolyzed, leading to a major conformational change of EF-Tu (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 6Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J.

Structure. 1996; 4: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This in turn triggers the subsequent release of EF-Tu·GDP from the ribosome. Fast regeneration of active EF-Tu·GTP from the inactive GDP form requires catalysis by the nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts. Kirromycin interrupts the functional cycle of EF-Tu by inhibiting the release of the EF-Tu·GDP complex from the ribosome. The resulting stalled ribosome causes a polysomal traffic jam on the mRNA. In accordance with this mechanism, kirromycin sensitivity is dominant over kirromycin resistance. The disability of EF-Tu·GDP to dissociate from the ribosome in the presence of kirromycin is due to the formation of a quaternary complex with aa-tRNA and the antibiotic (1Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Top. Antibiot. Chem. 1980; 5: 165-221Google Scholar, 9Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Wolf H. Maass G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 86: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, it has been shown in vitro that EF-Tu·GDP has significant affinity (Kd = 10 μm) for aa-tRNA in the presence but not in the absence of kirromycin (10Abrahams J.P. van Raaij M.J. Ott G. Kraal B. Bosch L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6705-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this could be that in this complex, the EF-Tu adopts a conformation similar to its GTP form even when bound to GDP (11Douglass J. Blumenthal T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5383-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting evidence for this idea is provided by the electrophoretic behavior (12Abrahams J.P. Kraal B. Bosch L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10099-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and by sensitivity toward proteolytic cleavage (11Douglass J. Blumenthal T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5383-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further activities of kirromycin (1Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Top. Antibiot. Chem. 1980; 5: 165-221Google Scholar) are (i) stimulation of the intrinsic GTPase activity of EF-Tu, (ii) decrease (by 3 orders of magnitude) of aa-tRNA binding to EF-Tu·GTP, (iii) inhibition of EF-Ts binding, (iv) increase of the EF-Tu nucleotide exchange rate for GDP (while affinity is largely unchanged), (v) increase of the affinity of EF-Tu for GTP by a factor of at least 100, and (vi) prevention of phosphorylation of EF-Tu (13Alexander C. Bilgin N. Lindschau C. Mesters J.R. Kraal B. Hilgenfeld R. Erdmann V.A. Lippmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14541-14547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). No crystal structure of an EF-Tu complex with kirromycin has been published to date, although crystals of a quaternary complex EF-Tu·GppNHp·Phe-tRNAPhe·kirromycin diffracting to ∼3.5 Å have been reported (14Kristensen O. Reshetnikova L. Nissen P. Siboska G. Thirup S. Nyborg J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a complex between EF-Tu·GDP and GE2270A, an antibiotic unrelated to kirromycin, has been published recently (15Heffron S.E. Jurnak F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of the 1:1:1 complex ofThermus thermophilus EF-Tu with GDP and aurodox at 2.0-Å resolution. The EF-Tu from this organism shares 82% sequence identity with the protein from Escherichia coli and has been shown to be similarly sensitive to kirromycin (16Zeidler W. Kreutzer R. Sprinzl M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The crystal structure presented here nicely explains the mutations reported to confer resistance to EF-Tu against the antibiotic (17Mesters J.R. Zeef L.A.H. Hilgenfeld R. de Graaf J.M. Kraal B. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4877-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Abdulkarim F. Liljas L. Hughes D.

EMBO J. 1984; 3: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Since aurodox was reported to be moderately sensitive to light (21Maehr H. Leach M. Williams T.H. Blount J.F. Can. J. Chem. 1980; 58: 501-526Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), exposure was kept at a minimum. Because of its extremely low solubility in water, a 120 mm alcoholic solution was prepared. T. thermophilus EF-Tu was overexpressed and purified as a GDP complex as previously described (22Blank J. Grillenbeck N.W. Kreutzer R. Sprinzl M. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The protein was then dialyzed into buffer (20 mmsodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mm magnesium sulfate, 20 μm GDP) and concentrated to 9–12 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. The EF-Tu·GDP·aurodox complex was prepared by adding aurodox at a 5–7-fold molar excess to the protein solution, followed by incubation overnight. A minor precipitate was removed by centrifugation before crystallization set-ups were prepared. Nearly complete formation of the EF-Tu·GDP·aurodox complex was verified by native gel electrophoresis. As described by Mesters et al. (17Mesters J.R. Zeef L.A.H. Hilgenfeld R. de Graaf J.M. Kraal B. Bosch L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4877-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the EF-Tu·GDP·aurodox complex showed a clear band shift compared with the aurodox-free EF-Tu·GDP. Chemicals used were obtained from Sigma or Merck in pro analysi quality. Crystals of EF-Tu·GDP·aurodox were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 2–4 μl of solution of this ternary complex were mixed with the same amount of reservoir solution (50 mm Tris, 200 mm sodium acetate, 23–25% polyethylene glycol 4000, final pH 7.8–9.0). Within 10 days in the dark at 19 °C, platelet-like crystals grew to a maximum size of 450 × 250 × 60 μm. Purification of the complex by gel filtration (Superdex 200 HR 10/30; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to crystallization did not improve the crystal quality. Crystals were removed from the crystallization droplet with a nylon loop and immediately flash-cooled in a 100 K nitrogen stream generated by an Oxford Cryostream cooling system (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, United Kingdom). No further cryoprotectant was needed in addition to the polyethylene glycol in the mother liquor. Diffraction data were initially collected using an FR591 rotating copper anode x-ray generator (Nonius, Delft, The Netherlands) equipped with a 30-cm Mar Research image plate (X-ray Research, Hamburg, Germany). Data extending to 2.6 Å were collected over a crystal rotation range of 124° in two batches, as recommended by the program STRATEGY (23Ravelli R.R.G. Sweet R.M. Skinner J.M. Duisenberg A.J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 551-554Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A full data set to 2.0-Å resolution was subsequently collected using the Joint IMB Jena-University of Hamburg-EMBL synchrotron beamline X13 at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg, at a wavelength of 0.913 Å. Diffraction intensities were recorded using a Mar Research CCD detector (X-ray Research, Hamburg, Germany).

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). TRUNCATE (25Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D, 50, 1994, 760, 763.Google Scholar) was used to derive structure amplitudes from the measured intensities. The space group was determined to be P21, with unit cell dimensionsa = 69.13 Å, b = 101.00 Å,c = 79.15 Å, β = 113.47°. This unit cell has not been observed before for any EF-Tu crystal. The asymmetric unit was assumed to contain two ternary complexes, corresponding to a packing density of 2.9 Å3/Da and a solvent content of ∼58% (26Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar). Using the diffraction data collected with CuKα radiation, molecular replacement was carried out using the program AMoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Based on the assumption that in the aurodox complex, a new EF-Tu conformation could exist as the consequence of a reorientation of domain 1 relative to the other two domains, domain 1 and domain 2/3 were treated as independent search molecules. In two different runs, the domains were taken from the structures of either Thermus aquaticus EF-Tu·GDP (8Polekhina G. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Lippmann C. Nyborg J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or T. thermophilus EF-Tu·GppNHp (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M.

Hilgenfeld, manuscript in preparation. leading to equivalent solutions (R = 0.420 and 0.431, correlation coefficient 0.520 and 0.547, respectively, for the resolution range between 15.0 and 3.5 Å). The correctness of the solution was indicated by the equivalent arrangement of domain 1 and domain 2/3 in both noncrystallographic copies of the complex in the asymmetric unit. Furthermore, the C terminus of domain 1 was close to the N terminus of domain 2/3. Although the two structural models obtained by the described molecular replacement approach were very similar, they were initially refined independently using CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuzewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). 5% of the unique reflections were set aside for the calculation of Rfree (29Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). After a first round of rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, and energy minimization in torsion angle space, the Rfreevalues at 3.2-Å resolution for the starting models derived from the GDP and GTP forms could be reduced to 0.372 and 0.354, respectively. Thereafter, refinement was continued with the model derived from theT. thermophilus EF-Tu·GppNHp complex only. At this stage of refinement, the linker between the C terminus of domain 1 and the N terminus of domain 2/3 could be modeled into the electron density. There was no clear density, however, for residues 39–66, which were therefore removed from the model at this stage. In comparison with the structure of EF-Tu·GppNHp (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar),2 the conformations of several side chains had to be altered, most notably that of Arg-124 (residue numbering is according to T. thermophilus EF-Tu). After this first round of refinement, the Rfreedropped to 0.335, and the densities for the GDP and aurodox molecules were very clear. The program Hyperchem (Hypercube Inc., Waterloo, Canada) was employed to build an initial atomic model for aurodox, which was then fitted into an Fo − Fc difference density map (contoured at 2.5 ς above the mean), using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). This step improved the Rfree to 0.305. Topology and parameter files for the antibiotic were generated with help of the program HIC-UP (31Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints used for the first rounds of refinement were later removed, and refinement was continued against the synchrotron data that had become available in the meantime. The R andRfree of the final structural model are 0.191 and 0.222, respectively, for all data between 20.0- and 2.0-Å resolution. Refinement statistics are given in Table I. For construction of several models for analyzing possible changes in EF-Tu·GDP or EF-Tu·GppNHp upon docking aurodox to its binding site, ALIGN (32Cohen G.E. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar) was used to superimpose the domains. For characterization of rigid body movements of domains (Table II), domains 1 of the pair of EF-Tu models to be compared were first superimposed (32Cohen G.E. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Then the rotation angle was calculated from the superposition operator of the analyzed elements.Table IICα r.m.s. deviation values comparing EF-Tu · GDP · aurodox with either EF-Tu · GppNHp (5Berchtold H.

Crystals of the EF-Tu·GDP·aurodox complex could be readily and reproducibly obtained following the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” Washed and dissolved crystals showed only one band on native polyacrylamide gels, with an unambiguous shift compared with EF-Tu·GDP, proving that all EF-Tu in the crystal was in complex with aurodox (data not shown). The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Initial trials using the complete EF-Tu molecule as a search model failed, irrespective of whether the GTP or GDP form of the protein (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K.

On the other hand, both forms lead to the correct solution when domains 1 and 2/3 were used as two separate search models. Using synchrotron radiation data, the model was refined to 2.0-Å resolution (TableI). Electron density for the aurodox molecule is shown in Fig. 2. The two ternary EF-Tu·GDP·aurodox complexes in the asymmetric unit of the crystal show no significant differences (r.m.s. deviation for 357 Cα positions was 0.20 Å; 0.34 Å for all 379 Cα positions in the model). All Cα–Cα deviations larger than 0.6 Å (i.e. at residues 233 (2.36 Å), 357 (1.36 Å), 296 (0.91 Å), 142 (0.86 Å), and 214 (0.83 Å)) can be explained by crystal contacts. The model comprises a total of 770 amino acid residues, two GDP molecules, two Mg2+ ions, two aurodox molecules, and 598 water molecules. Residues 1 and 2 of each molecule, residues 53–64 in molecule A, and residues 42–65 in molecule B have been omitted in the model due to poor or missing electron density. Since the region 42–65, the so-called effector region of EF-Tu, is often subject to spontaneous proteolysis (33Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used to prove that the protein was not cleaved in our crystals (data not shown). Therefore, we have to assume that this region is not visible in the electron density maps due to its high mobility. To appreciate the uniqueness of the structure presented in this paper, a brief overview of the known structures and forms of EF-Tu is needed here. The protein folds into three clearly distinct domains (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 6Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Domain 1 (residues 7–210) is composed of a predominantly parallel six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. It contains the guanine nucleotide-binding site (hence, it is also called the “G domain”). Two segments of the polypeptide chain, switch I (residues 50–64) and switch II (residues 83–99), act as sensors for the presence or absence of GTP and transmit this signal into the other two domains (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 7Abel K. Yoder M. Hilgenfeld R. Jurnak F. Structure. 1996; 4: 1153-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the GTP form, switch I forms an α-helix, which unfolds to a β-hairpin in the GDP complex (7Abel K. Yoder M. Hilgenfeld R. Jurnak F. Structure. 1996; 4: 1153-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 8Polekhina G. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Lippmann C. Nyborg J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, the switch II helix changes both its orientation and length upon GTP hydrolysis (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 7Abel K. Yoder M. Hilgenfeld R. Jurnak F. Structure. 1996; 4: 1153-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Domain 2 (residues 212–310) and domain 3 (residues 311–405) are β-barrels of seven and six antiparallel β-strands, respectively, that share an extended interface. Characteristic for each of the known EF-Tu structures is the relative arrangement of domains 2/3 to domain 1. So far, in all known complexes with GTP analogues, the EF-Tu exists in a compact form with tight interfaces between domains 1 and 2 as well as 1 and 3 (Fig.3 A (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar)). This conformation is also seen in the ternary complexes of EF-Tu·GppNHp with aa-tRNAs (34Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar,35Nissen P. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Structure. 1999; 7: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast, in all GDP complex structures determined so far, a large hole opens between domains 1 and 2, making the molecule much less compact (Fig. 3 C (7Abel K. Yoder M. Hilgenfeld R. Jurnak F. Structure. 1996; 4: 1153-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 8Polekhina G. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Lippmann C. Nyborg J.

Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar)). Certainly, the most striking feature of the ternary complex between EF-Tu·GDP and aurodox presented here (Fig. 3 B) is its overall similarity to that of the binary complex EF-Tu·GppNHp, the active conformation of EF-Tu (Fig. 3 A). The current structure supports the proposal that kirromycin induces a conformation of EF-Tu·GDP that is similar to the GTP form, thus preventing its release from the ribosome after and despite hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and Pi. Aurodox binds to the interface between domains 1 and 3 (Fig. 3 B). To accommodate the antibiotic in this binding site, domains 2 and 3 are rotated by about 9.7 and 15.4°, respectively (averaged values for molecules A and B), relative to their position in the GppNHp form (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).2 This rotation implies a small but unambiguous movement of domain 3 with respect to domain 2. The Cα r.m.s. deviation values between EF-Tu·GDP·aurodox and either EF-Tu·GppNHp (5Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R.

Structure. 1996; 4: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) are listed in Table II. To force EF-Tu·GDP into this GTP complex-like conformation, the antibiotic has to provide more favorable interactions between itself and domains 1 and 3 than these domains alone would have in the GDP complex. This is achieved by strong interactions of the antibiotic with both domains 1 and 3, effectively gluing them together (see Figs. 3 and 4and Table III).Table IIIContacts between aurodox (Aur) and T. thermophilus EF-Tu: hydrogen bonds (<3.0 Å), van der Waals contacts (<3.7 Å), and a few selected distancesRegionContactE. coliMolecule AMolecule BÅÅPyridone ringAur O2–Water A561/B5822.752.89Aur O2–Water A523/B5582.592.64Aur O4–Tyr-161 OHY1602.632.57Aur O4–Water A757/B8132.732.85Aur C4–Glu-327 OE23.393.44Aur C6–Leu-121 CD2L1203.493.35LinkerAur O7–Water A561/B582"

Especially, renal and prostate cancers are known as intrinsic drug-resistant cancers, which already have a relatively resistant phenotype to anti-cancer agents even without drug selection (9Naito S. Yokomizo A. Koga H. Int. J. Urol. 1999; 6: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This may explain the low response of hormone-insensitive prostate tumors toward cytostatic agents (9Naito S. Yokomizo A. Koga H. Int. J. Urol. 1999; 6: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Beedassy A. Cardi G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 428-438PubMed Google Scholar).In most strategies developed to reverse the MDR phenotype, chemical-reversing agents are applied, which have in common the ability to reverse the MDR phenotype through the binding to the MDR transporters (11Sarkadi B. Muller M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A more efficient strategy to circumvent MDR would be to down-regulate the expression of genes coding for the transporters. This, however, requires knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways that are involved in the regulation of MDR-related genes and elaboration of sophisticated experimental approaches that efficiently down-regulate the drug transporters. Recently, it has been pointed out that the expression of Pgp may be redox-regulated, because down-regulation of Pgp and reversal of the MDR phenotype was achieved by treatment of tumor cells with tumor necrosis factor α (12Stein U. Walther W. Laurencot C.M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Shoemaker R.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is known to utilize low levels of ROS in its signal transduction pathway (13Deshpande S.S. Angkeow P. Huang J. Ozaki M. Irani K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that high levels of ROS resulting in severe cellular oxidative stress increased the expression of the MRP-1 (14Yamane Y. Furuichi M. Song R. Van N.T. Mulcahy R.T. Ishikawa T. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31075-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and MDR-1b (15Ziemann C. Burkle A. Kahl G.F. Hirsch-Ernst K.I. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) genes.In previous studies we have reported on an intrinsic Pgp MDR, which develops in quiescent cell areas of large, non-necrotic multicellular prostate tumor spheroids derived from the androgen-independent cell line DU-145 (7Wartenberg M. Frey C. Diedershagen H. Ritgen J. Hescheler J. Sauer H. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Acker H. Diedershagen H. Sauer H. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We furthermore demonstrated that the MDR phenotype could be reversed and that Pgp could be down-regulated upon incubation of spheroids with chemical agents that raised intracellular ROS and stimulated cell cycle activity (16Wartenberg M. Fischer K. Hescheler J. Sauer H. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The current study presents evidence that the development of intrinsic Pgp expression is a general phenomenon occurring in multicellular tumor spheroids of different origin, i.e. melanoma, hepatoma, and glioma tumor spheroids. It is hypothesized that endogenously generated ROS are regulating the expression of intrinsic Pgp in multicellular tumor spheroids, because small, exponentially growing spheroids, which robustly generate ROS, display reduced Pgp levels, whereas up-regulation of Pgp in large, non-necrotic tumor spheroids coincides with decreased ROS levels. It is shown that an elevation of intracellular ROS is down-regulating Pgp expression via the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, which results in the phosphorylation of MAPK members and mitogenic stimulation. The modulation of the intracellular redox state by BSO or other ROS-generating agents is apparently suitable in vitro to circumvent the MDR phenotype and may be useful in vivo to promote the efficacy of chemotherapeutic regimen in anti-cancer treatment.DISCUSSIONThe present study reports on the correlation of endogenous intracellular ROS levels and the intrinsic expression of Pgp in multicellular prostate tumor spheroids of different size classes. The transient expression of Pgp during the growth of tumor spheroids, and its correlation with cell quiescence is apparently a general feature of tumor tissues, because tumor spheroids cultivated from glioma, melanoma, and hepatoma tumor cells displayed comparable features of intrinsic expression of Pgp as observed in the DU-145 prostate cancer cell line. The observation of a transient increase of Pgp-mediated drug resistance during the growth of avascular micrometastases may be of clinical significance, because the outcome of chemotherapeutic treatment critically depends on the chemosensitivity of the treated neoplastic tissue, which may be predicted from levels of Pgp expression as well as the expression of cell cycle-related genes in tumor biopsies. In DU-145 tumor spheroids the intrinsic Pgp expression was clearly correlated to increased levels of the CDK inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21WAF-1, which are increased during cell cycle arrest. Consequently, tumor spheroids with elevated levels of Pgp expression displayed minor endogenous activity of the cell growth-associated MAPK-members ERK1,2 and JNK. There is increasing evidence that the growth of neoplastic tissues is controlled by the generation of ROS, which have been previously shown to arise in Ras-mediated signaling pathways (23Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). The data of the present study are in notion with these previous studies, because it is demonstrated that increased ROS generation was observed in small tumor spheroids that consist predominantly of exponentially growing Ki-67-positive cells as well as in large tumor spheroids containing extended central necrosis. The increase in Ki-67 expression was paralleled by an augmented activity of JNK in small spheroids and large spheroids containing central necrosis as well as an increased activity of ERK1,2 in small tumor spheroids.The correlation of elevated Pgp levels with reduced levels of ROS as well as diminished activity of ERK1,2 and JNK led us to hypothesize that raising intracellular ROS may down-regulate Pgp expression via up-regulation of ERK1,2 and JNK. An increase in intracellular ROS was achieved by: addition of hydrogen peroxide to the cell culture medium, depletion of intracellular glutathione by the use of BSO and glutamine-reduced cell culture medium, as well as treatment with EGF, which has been previously demonstrated to raise intracellular ROS (31Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). All these experimental procedures resulted in significant down-regulation of Pgp levels, indicating that ROS are involved in the signaling pathways that regulate the expression of Pgp. Interestingly, with hydrogen peroxide concentrations exceeding 500 μm an up-regulation of Pgp was observed. A rise in Pgp expression following treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide has been previously demonstrated (15Ziemann C. Burkle A. Kahl G.F. Hirsch-Ernst K.I. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study millimolar concentrations of H2O2 were administered, resulting in a parallel up-regulation of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is a nuclear enzyme induced by DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, stress-induced expression of Pgp has been recently evidenced under various conditions,i.e. UV radiation (32Uchiumi T. Kohno K. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Sato S. Uchida Y. Kuwano M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar), low external pH and osmotic shock (33Wei L.Y. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7229-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as heat stress (34Miyazaki M. Kohno K. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Nasu M. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Most of these stress factors are accompanied by the generation of intracellular ROS. Under stress conditions the physiological role of Pgp may be related to the prevention of apoptosis (35Johnstone R.W. Cretney E. Smyth M.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably by regulating caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways (36Smyth M.J. Krasovskis E. Sutton V.R. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7024-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This notion is furthermore supported by studies that demonstrated that overexpression of Pgp is correlated with increased levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein (37Kojima H. Endo K. Moriyama H. Tanaka Y. Alnemri E.S. Slapak C.A. Teicher B. Kufe D. Datta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16647-16650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ROS acting as signaling agents in the regulation of cell proliferation are in the nanomolar to micromolar range and are therefore significantly lower than the concentrations necessary to induce DNA strand breakage (38Burdon R.H. Gill V. Alliangana D. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, intracellular ROS may exert differential effects on the regulation of MDR-related genes, which are dependent on their intracellular concentration.In the present study raising intracellular ROS by depletion of glutathione resulted in a decline of p27Kip1 expression, whereas activity of ERK1,2 and JNK was significantly elevated, which indicates that in parallel to the down-regulation of Pgp expression a stimulation of the cell cycle was achieved, suggesting that cell cycle stimulation by ROS and the regulation of Pgp expression may share a common signal transduction pathway. This assumption was supported by experiments demonstrating that pharmacological inhibition of members of the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway utilized by EGF, and involving PKC and Ras/Raf as well as ERK1,2, abolished the observed down-regulation of Pgp following elevation of intracellular ROS. Interestingly, incubation of tumor spheroids in serum-free media and treatment with tyrphostin, which inhibits protein tyrosine kinases, including autophosphorylation of EGF receptor kinase, significantly increased the expression of Pgp in multicellular tumor spheroids. These findings support the notion that EGF present in the fetal calf serum used in the cell culture medium and/or EGF secreted by tumor cells may regulate Pgp expression via the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways.The apparent effects of ROS on Pgp expression levels and cell cycle activity in multicellular tumor spheroids may be clinically utilized in anti-cancer trials. In EMT-6 tumor spheroids down-regulation of p27Kip1, which has been discussed as a regulator of MDR (39St. Croix B. Florenes V.A. Rak J.W. Flanagan M. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J.M. Kerbel R.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), by antisense nucleotides increased cell proliferation and sensitized tumor cells to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (39St. Croix B. Florenes V.A. Rak J.W. Flanagan M. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J.M. Kerbel R.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A comparable chemosensitization in EMT-6 tumor spheroids was observed by treatment with hyaluronidase, which reduced intercellular communication and activated cell proliferation (40Croix B.S. Rak J.W. Kapitain S. Sheehan C. Graham C.H. Kerbel R.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation of cell proliferation in noncycling hematopoietic progenitor cells and leukemic blasts resulted in a down-regulation of Pgp-mediated MDR (41Smeets M.E. Raymakers R.A. Vierwinden G. Pennings A.H. Wessels H. de Witte T. Blood. 1999; 94: 2414-2423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An elevation of ROS by depletion of intracellular glutathione sounds reasonable, because BSO has successfully been applied in vivo in cancer patients and was shown to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells toward antineoplastic drugs (42O'Dwyer P.J. Hamilton T.C. LaCreta F.P. Gallo J.M. Kilpatrick D. Halbherr T. Brennan J. Bookman M.A. Hoffman J. Young R.C. Comis R.L. Ozols R.F. J. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 14: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because most antineoplastic agents are acting against rapidly cycling cancer cells, the concomitant cell cycle stimulation and down-regulation of Pgp by ROS may offer new avenues for conventional chemotherapy. This may hold especially true for hormone-independent metastatic prostate tumors, which are characterized by a high fraction of cells resting in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and a pronounced intrinsic resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer agents (9Naito S. Yokomizo A. Koga H. Int. J. Urol. 1999; 6: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The treatment of cancer is limited by either intrinsic or acquired expression of multidrug resistance transporters, including Pgp.1 The Pgp-mediated MDR phenotype is generally characterized by a decreased cellular drug accumulation owing to an enhanced drug efflux and is caused by the overexpression of the drug transporter (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3550) Google Scholar, 2Simon S.M. Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most in vitrostudies have been performed using cell cultures selected for drug resistance by repetitive treatment with anti-cancer agents or using recurrent tumors from patients after chemotherapy (3Volm M. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2905-2917PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is increasing evidence that Pgp-mediated MDR is likewise developing in the multicellular context of tumor tissues, without previous treatment with anti-cancer agents (4Oda Y. Schneider-Stock R. Rys J. Gruchala A. Niezabitowski A. Roessner A. Diagn. Mol. Pathol. 1996; 5: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Dhar D.K. Nagasue N. Yoshimura H. Tachibana M.

Consequently, tumor spheroids with elevated levels of Pgp expression displayed minor endogenous activity of the cell growth-associated MAPK-members ERK1,2 and JNK. There is increasing evidence that the growth of neoplastic tissues is controlled by the generation of ROS, which have been previously shown to arise in Ras-mediated signaling pathways (23Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). The data of the present study are in notion with these previous studies, because it is demonstrated that increased ROS generation was observed in small tumor spheroids that consist predominantly of exponentially growing Ki-67-positive cells as well as in large tumor spheroids containing extended central necrosis. The increase in Ki-67 expression was paralleled by an augmented activity of JNK in small spheroids and large spheroids containing central necrosis as well as an increased activity of ERK1,2 in small tumor spheroids. The correlation of elevated Pgp levels with reduced levels of ROS as well as diminished activity of ERK1,2 and JNK led us to hypothesize that raising intracellular ROS may down-regulate Pgp expression via up-regulation of ERK1,2 and JNK. An increase in intracellular ROS was achieved by: addition of hydrogen peroxide to the cell culture medium, depletion of intracellular glutathione by the use of BSO and glutamine-reduced cell culture medium, as well as treatment with EGF, which has been previously demonstrated to raise intracellular ROS (31Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). All these experimental procedures resulted in significant down-regulation of Pgp levels, indicating that ROS are involved in the signaling pathways that regulate the expression of Pgp. Interestingly, with hydrogen peroxide concentrations exceeding 500 μm an up-regulation of Pgp was observed. A rise in Pgp expression following treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide has been previously demonstrated (15Ziemann C. Burkle A. Kahl G.F. Hirsch-Ernst K.I. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study millimolar concentrations of H2O2 were administered, resulting in a parallel up-regulation of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is a nuclear enzyme induced by DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, stress-induced expression of Pgp has been recently evidenced under various conditions,i.e. UV radiation (32Uchiumi T. Kohno K. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Sato S. Uchida Y. Kuwano M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar), low external pH and osmotic shock (33Wei L.Y. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7229-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as heat stress (34Miyazaki M. Kohno K. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Matsuo K. Nasu M. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Most of these stress factors are accompanied by the generation of intracellular ROS. Under stress conditions the physiological role of Pgp may be related to the prevention of apoptosis (35Johnstone R.W. Cretney E. Smyth M.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably by regulating caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways (36Smyth M.J. Krasovskis E. Sutton V.R. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7024-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This notion is furthermore supported by studies that demonstrated that overexpression of Pgp is correlated with increased levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein (37Kojima H. Endo K. Moriyama H. Tanaka Y. Alnemri E.S. Slapak C.A. Teicher B. Kufe D. Datta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16647-16650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ROS acting as signaling agents in the regulation of cell proliferation are in the nanomolar to micromolar range and are therefore significantly lower than the concentrations necessary to induce DNA strand breakage (38Burdon R.H. Gill V. Alliangana D. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, intracellular ROS may exert differential effects on the regulation of MDR-related genes, which are dependent on their intracellular concentration. In the present study raising intracellular ROS by depletion of glutathione resulted in a decline of p27Kip1 expression, whereas activity of ERK1,2 and JNK was significantly elevated, which indicates that in parallel to the down-regulation of Pgp expression a stimulation of the cell cycle was achieved, suggesting that cell cycle stimulation by ROS and the regulation of Pgp expression may share a common signal transduction pathway. This assumption was supported by experiments demonstrating that pharmacological inhibition of members of the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway utilized by EGF, and involving PKC and Ras/Raf as well as ERK1,2, abolished the observed down-regulation of Pgp following elevation of intracellular ROS. Interestingly, incubation of tumor spheroids in serum-free media and treatment with tyrphostin, which inhibits protein tyrosine kinases, including autophosphorylation of EGF receptor kinase, significantly increased the expression of Pgp in multicellular tumor spheroids. These findings support the notion that EGF present in the fetal calf serum used in the cell culture medium and/or EGF secreted by tumor cells may regulate Pgp expression via the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. The apparent effects of ROS on Pgp expression levels and cell cycle activity in multicellular tumor spheroids may be clinically utilized in anti-cancer trials. In EMT-6 tumor spheroids down-regulation of p27Kip1, which has been discussed as a regulator of MDR (39St. Croix B. Florenes V.A. Rak J.W. Flanagan M. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J.M. Kerbel R.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), by antisense nucleotides increased cell proliferation and sensitized tumor cells to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (39St. Croix B. Florenes V.A. Rak J.W. Flanagan M. Bhattacharya N. Slingerland J.M. Kerbel R.S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A comparable chemosensitization in EMT-6 tumor spheroids was observed by treatment with hyaluronidase, which reduced intercellular communication and activated cell proliferation (40Croix B.S. Rak J.W. Kapitain S. Sheehan C. Graham C.H. Kerbel R.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation of cell proliferation in noncycling hematopoietic progenitor cells and leukemic blasts resulted in a down-regulation of Pgp-mediated MDR (41Smeets M.E. Raymakers R.A. Vierwinden G. Pennings A.H. Wessels H. de Witte T. Blood. 1999; 94: 2414-2423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An elevation of ROS by depletion of intracellular glutathione sounds reasonable, because BSO has successfully been applied in vivo in cancer patients and was shown to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells toward antineoplastic drugs (42O'Dwyer P.J. Hamilton T.C. LaCreta F.P. Gallo J.M. Kilpatrick D. Halbherr T. Brennan J. Bookman M.A. Hoffman J. Young R.C. Comis R.L. Ozols R.F. J. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 14: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because most antineoplastic agents are acting against rapidly cycling cancer cells, the concomitant cell cycle stimulation and down-regulation of Pgp by ROS may offer new avenues for conventional chemotherapy. This may hold especially true for hormone-independent metastatic prostate tumors, which are characterized by a high fraction of cells resting in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and a pronounced intrinsic resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer agents (9Naito S. Yokomizo A. Koga H. Int. J. Urol. 1999; 6: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)."

Although CFTR plays a prominent role in HCO 3− secretion, the role of CFTR in HCO 3− salvage is not known. In the present work, we used molecular, biochemical, and functional approaches to study the regulatory interaction between CFTR and the HCO 3− salvage mechanism Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) in heterologous expression systems and in the native pancreatic duct. We found that CFTR regulates NHE3 activity by both acute and chronic mechanisms. In the pancreatic duct, CFTR increases expression of NHE3 in the luminal membrane. Thus, luminal expression of NHE3 was reduced by 53% in ducts of homozygote ΔF508 mice. Accordingly, luminal Na+-dependent and HOE694- sensitive recovery from an acid load was reduced by 60% in ducts of ΔF508 mice. CFTR and NHE3 were co-immunoprecipitated from PS120 cells expressing both proteins and the pancreatic duct of wild type mice but not from PS120 cells lacking CFTR or the pancreas of ΔF508 mice. The interaction between CFTR and NHE3 required the COOH-terminal PDZ binding motif of CFTR, and mutant CFTR proteins lacking the C terminus were not co-immunoprecipitated with NHE3. Furthermore, when expressed in PS120 cells, wild type CFTR, but not CFTR mutants lacking the C-terminal PDZ binding motif, augmented cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity by 31%.

HCO 3− is an important constituent of secreted fluids by virtue of its function as the biological pH buffer and its effect on the solubility of proteins and ions in biological fluids. Accordingly, the mechanisms underlying HCO 3− homeostasis at rest and during stimulation have attracted much attention in recent years. The importance of HCO 3− homeostasis is evident from the marked reduction in Cl−- and HCO 3− -dependent fluid secretion in the pancreatic juice of cystic fibrosis (CF)1 patients (1Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B. Lancet. 1968; 1: 455-460Abstract Google Scholar). CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR functions as a Cl−channel, and many mutations causing CF reduce or abolish Cl− channel activity (2Pilewski J.M. Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S215-S255Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, several CFTR mutations retain normal or even elevated Cl− channel activity although they are associated with mild or severe forms of CF (3Vankeerberghen A. Wei L. Jaspers M. Cassiman J.J. Nilius B. Cuppens H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This suggests that CFTR may have other functions, besides conducting Cl−, that are essential for normal fluid and electrolyte transport. Indeed, CFTR regulates the activity of the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC (4Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), and CFTR supports Cl−/HCO 3− exchange activity in heterologous expression systems (5Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and in the mouse pancreatic duct (6Lee M.G. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Strickland E. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14670-14677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Importantly, aberrant HCO 3− transport in cells expressing CFTR mutants that retain Cl− channel activity correlates with the pancreatic status of the CF phenotype (7Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Another HCO 3− -transporting mechanism in tissues that express CFTR is HCO 3− -absorbing processes that may function as HCO 3− salvage mechanisms in the resting state (8Lee M.G. Ahn W. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Seo J.T. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic duct (8Lee M.G. Ahn W. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Seo J.T. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the kidney proximal tubule (9Choi J.Y. Shah M. Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Muallem S. Baum M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), 50% of HCO 3− absorption is mediated by the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) and 50% by a novel, yet unidentified, Na+-dependent mechanism. Hence, HCO 3− homeostasis in secretory epithelia is accomplished by both HCO 3− -absorbing (resting state) and HCO 3− -secretory (stimulated state) mechanisms. An intriguing feature of HCO 3− homeostasis is the possibility that the activity of multiple proteins involved in this process is regulated by CFTR through interaction with the scaffolding protein ERM (ezrin, radixin,moesin)-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) (also known as NHE-regulatory factor 1, or NHERF1). EPB50 has two PDZ domains and a C-terminal ERM binding domain. Separate reports showed that the first PDZ domain of EBP50 preferentially binds the C terminus of CFTR (10Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and that NHE3 interacts with EBP50 via a nontraditional association that requires the second PDZ domain and the C terminus of EBP50 (11Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Likewise, CFTR and NHE3 both associate with the closely related protein E3KARP (12Sun F. Hug M.J. Lewarchik C.M. Yun C. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29539-29546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). NHE3 activity is acutely inhibited by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, and EBP50 or E3KARP is required to mediate this inhibition, perhaps by binding to ezrin, which may function as a protein kinase A anchoring protein (13Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Since both CFTR and NHE3 can associate with EBP50 and cAMP regulates both activities, we considered the possibility that CFTR modulates the activity of NHE3 by association with EBP50 or other related proteins (13Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 14Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In this manner, CFTR can regulate not only HCO 3− secretion but also HCO 3− salvage. In the present work, we used biochemical and functional approaches to study the interaction of CFTR and NHE3 with EBP50 and the functional significance of this interaction in heterologous expression systems and the native pancreatic duct. In pancreatic duct and PS120 cells expressing NHE3 and EBP50, expression of CFTR augmented the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3 activity. Most notably, CFTR in the pancreatic duct affected not only the activity but also the expression of NHE3 protein in the luminal membrane. These findings reveal a new mechanism by which CFTR regulates ion transport at the luminal membrane and highlight the multiple functions of CFTR in regulating the overall HCO 3− homeostasis in the pancreatic duct and possibly in other CFTR-expressing epithelia. BCECF-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antiserum directed against human EBP50 was generated in rabbits as described previously (15Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M.

Rabbit antisera 1566 and 1568 specific for NHE3 were generated as described previously (16Amemiya M. Loffing J. Lotscher M. Kaissling B. Alpern R.J. Moe O.W.

Monoclonal antibodies against an R domain and a C terminus of CFTR were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The solution A, used for microdissection and perfusion, contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 glucose. Na+-free solutions were prepared by replacing Na+ withN-methyl-d-glucamine+ from solution A. An NHE-deficient cell line PS120, originally developed by Pouyssegur et al. (17Pouyssegur J. Sardet C.

Olschowska J.A. Richardson L.A. Bookstein C. Chang E.B. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 39: G470-G478Google Scholar) were provided by Drs. K. Park and J. E. Melvin (University of Rochester). Mammalian expressing pCMV-CFTR (pCMVNot6.2) vector was a gift from Dr. J. Rommens at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada). Mammalian expressing Ad-CFTR virus was purchased from the Institute of Human Gene Therapy (Philadelphia, PA), and pcDNA3.1-EBP50 was generated by subcloning the full-length EBP50 cDNA from pET-EBP50 (15Mohler P.J.

PS120 cells were maintained in DMEM-HG (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (50 units/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The pCMV-NHE3 construct was stably transfected into a PS120 cell line using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Life Technologies). NHE3 stable transfectants (PS120/NHE3) were selected by resistance to the antibiotic Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.) and by an H+-killing method (19Wakabayashi S. Fafournoux P. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the GeneEditor mutagenesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was performed in the CFTR expression vector pCMVNot6.2 to delete the C-terminal 4 (ΔDTRL) or 26 (S1455X) amino acids. Briefly, mutants were selected based upon the incorporation of a second-site mutation in β-lactamase, which alters its substrate specificity, allowing resistance of transformed bacteria to cefotaxime and cerftriaxone in addition to ampicillin. Incorporation of the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. The mutagenesis primers were as follows: ΔDTRL, 5′-GGA GAC AGA AGA AGA GGT G T A AGA TAC AAG GCT TTA GAG AG-3′; S1455X, 5′-GCT CTT TCC CCA CCG GAA CTGAAG CAA GTG CAA GTC TAA GCC-3′. mRNA transcripts of mouse EBP50, E3KARP, and PDZK1 (20Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar) were analyzed in pancreatic and PS120 cells using RT-PCR. Among several primer sets designed based on the mouse sequences, at least one set for each protein detected the correct band in samples from hamster as well as mouse tissues. The primer sequences were as follows: 1) mEBP50, sense (5′-CTA AGC CAG GCC AGT TCA TCC GAG CAG T-3′) and antisense (5′-TGG GGT CAG AGG AGG AGG AGG AGG TAG A-3′), size of PCR product 447 base pairs; 2) mE3KARP, sense (5′-GAG GCC CGG CTG CTG GTA GTC G-3′) and antisense (5′-CAT CTG TGG TGC CCG CTT GTT GA-3′), size of PCR product 312 base pairs; 3) mPDZK1, sense (5′-GAC AAG GCT GGG CTG GAG AAT GAG GAC-3′) and antisense (5′-CGA AGA GTG CGA GGC TGT GCT GAG AGT-3′), size of PCR product 297 base pairs. RNA was extracted from the tissue using Trizol solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and an RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). The cDNA was amplified using specific primers and a Taq polymerase (Promega), and the products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The identities of all amplified products were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Precleared pancreatic or PS120 lysates (∼2 mg of protein) were mixed with the appropriate antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C in lysis buffer. Immune complexes were collected by binding to protein G- (monoclonal antibody against R domain of CFTR) or protein A- (all other antibodies) Sepharose and washing four times with lysis buffer prior to electrophoresis. The immunoprecipitates or lysates (20 μg of protein) were suspended in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were blocked by a 1-h incubation at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The proteins were detected by 1-h incubations with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. The pancreata from several wild type (WT) and homozygous ΔF508 (ΔF) mice were embedded in OCT (Miles, Elkhart, IN), frozen in liquid N2, and cut into 4-μm sections. Immunostaining of frozen sections was performed as previously reported (8Lee M.G. Ahn W. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Seo J.T. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were fixed and permeabilized by incubation with cold methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. After removal of the methanol, slices were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the tissue area was encircled using a hydrophobic marker (Pap Pen;Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin (blocking medium). After blocking, the sections were stained by incubation with the appropriate primary antiserum followed by fluorophore-tagged secondary antibodies. For double labeling experiments, these primary and secondary incubations were repeated with antibodies against the second protein of interest. Then the sections were incubated in a bisbenzimide (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) solution to stain DNA and sealed with a coverslip using a Mowiol-based (Calbiochem) mounting medium. Images were collected with a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope. When desired, NHE3 expression in the LM of the pancreatic duct was compared between samples from wild type and ΔF mice. In this case, all of the images were taken at the same laser intensity, and the same recording conditions and staining intensities of specified regions were analyzed using an imaging software (MCID version 3.0; Brook University, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). Briefly, the pixel counts of a 1-μm square region in the nucleus (FNuc; background) and a midportion of the LM (FLM) of the same cell were measured. The ratio of (FLM − FNuc)/FNuc from multiple cells taken from at least three separate sections and from separate animals were averaged and compared between each group. A cystic fibrosis mouse model in which the ΔF508 mutation was introduced in the mouse CFTR gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (21Zeiher B.G. Eichwald E. Zabner J. Smith J.J. Puga A.P. McCray Jr., P.B. Capecchi M.R. Welsh M.J. Thomas K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2051-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. K. R. Thomas (University of Utah). The mice were maintained on a standard diet, and genotyping was carried out during days 7–14 postpartum, as described (22Zeng W. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R. Freedman S. Cotton C. Muallem S. Thomas P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure for preparation and perfusion of the main pancreatic duct was identical to that described previously (8Lee M.G. Ahn W. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Seo J.T. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized, the abdomen was opened, and the duct lumen was cannulated using a modified 31-gauge needle. After ligating the proximal end of the common duct, the pancreas was removed into a dish containing ice-cold solution A supplemented with 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The main duct was cleared of acini and connective tissue, and the proximal end of the main duct was cut in order to facilitate retrograde luminal perfusion. After transferring to the perfusion chamber and during pHi measurement, the ducts were continuously perfused with separate bath and luminal solutions. For measurement of pHi in PS120/NHE3 cells, the glass coverslips with cells attached to them were washed once with solution A and assembled to form the bottom of a perfusion chamber. The cells were loaded with BCECF by a 10-min incubation at room temperature in solution A containing 2.5 μm BCECF-AM. After dye loading, the cells were perfused with appropriate solutions, and pHi was measured by photon counting using a fluorescence measuring system (Delta Ram; PTI Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). In the case of CFTR transfection with pCMVNot6.2 or its C-terminal deleted mutants, a green fluorescent protein-expressing plasmid (Life Technologies) was co-transfected with the CFTR constructs, and pHi measurements were performed with cells expressing high levels of green fluorescent protein as previously reported (5Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3414-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For pHi measurement in the microdissected ducts, the cannulated ducts were transferred to a perfusion chamber placed on the stage of an inverted microscope. The bath was perfused at a flow rate of 6 ml/min, and the lumen was perfused at a flow rate of 150 μl/min using solution A that was maintained at 37 °C. BCECF was loaded by including 2.5 μm BCECF-AM in the luminal perfusate for 5 min, and dye loading was monitored. After completion of dye loading, the lumen was washed by perfusing solution A, and pHi measurements were performed according to the specified protocols. The fluorescence ratios of 490/440 nm were calibrated intracellularly by perfusing the cells or the ducts with solutions containing 145 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 μm nigericin with pH adjusted to 6.2–7.8. Na+/H+ exchange activity was measured using a standard protocol (23Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 513: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cells were acidified by an NH 4+ pulse and subsequent perfusion with a Na+-free solution. The maximal Na+-dependent pHi recovery was measured in cells acidified to pHi 6.4–6.5. Buffer capacity was calculated by measuring ΔpHi in response to 5–20 mm NH4Cl pulses. In each experiment, the buffer capacity (βi) showed a negative linear relationship with pHi between 6.4 and 7.3. The βi of PS120 cells (30.2 ± 2.1 mm/pH unit at pHi 7.0) was lower than that of the pancreatic duct cells (48.6 ± 6.2). However, forskolin treatment or any gene modulation did not significantly change βi. Therefore, all the results of NHE activity are expressed as ΔpH/min, and this value was directly analyzed without compensating for βi. The results are presented as mean ± S.E., and, when appropriate, statistical analysis was determined using Student'st test or analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To set the stage for analyzing the interaction between CFTR and NHE3 in model systems and native cells, we first determined which of the adapter proteins known to interact with CFTR are expressed in these cells (10Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 12Sun F.

These include EBP50 and E3KARP, both of which contain two PDZ domains and associate with ezrin via the C terminus. We also examined the expression of the related mRNA encoding PDZK1 (also called CAP70), a protein that contains four PDZ domains (20Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). Although PDZK1 is known to associate with CFTR (24Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), it is not known whether it also associates with NHE3 or ezrin via an ERM binding domain. The RT-PCR analysis shown in Fig.1 A reveals expression of mRNA for EBP50, E3KARP (13Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and PDZK1 (20Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar) in hamster lung and the mouse pancreas. On the other hand, only mRNA for EBP50 was detected in PS120 cells. Expression of EBP50 in PS120 cells was unexpected, since a previous study reported that this cell line does not express EBP50 (13Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To substantiate the RT-PCR findings, expression of EBP50 in the hamster fibroblast-derived PS120 clone was first verified by sequencing the amplified RT-PCR product. As shown in Fig. 1 B, EBP50 in PS120 cells showed the highest similarity to Chinese hamster EBP50 with 99% homology based on nucleotide sequences (GenBankTMaccession numbers AF307992 and AF307993). The 1% sequence difference is probably due to the use of mutagenic agents during the selection of the NHE-deficient cells (17Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) or due to substrain differences. Expression of EBP50 protein in our PS120 cells was examined by Western blotting using a polyclonal antiserum generated against full-length human EBP50. Fig. 1 C shows expression of EBP50 protein in both PS120 cells and the mouse pancreas. Previous works reported that EBP50 can associate with CFTR or NHE3 (10Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D.

Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We first confirmed these findings in our PS120 cells that were transfected with either CFTR or NHE3 (not shown). Subsequently, we asked whether CFTR and NHE3 exist in the same complex when expressed in PS120 cells and in the in vivo situation. For these experiments, NHE3 was stably expressed in PS120 cells to generate the PS120/NHE3 clone, and a portion of PS120/NHE3 cells was infected with Ad-CFTR. The blot in Fig. 2 Ashows that expression of CFTR had no measurable effect on expression of NHE3 protein in PS120/NHE3 cells. Lysates were prepared from control and CFTR-expressing PS120/NHE3 cells, and an antibody recognizing the R domain of CFTR was used to immunoprecipitate CFTR from PS120/NHE3 cells and PS120/NHE3 cells co-expressing CFTR. NHE3 was found in the CFTR immunoprecipitates from the cells infected with Ad-CFTR (Fig.2 C), demonstrating that exogenously expressed CFTR and NHE3 may associate in a stable complex in PS120 cells. To determine whether CFTR and NHE3 also associate in native cells, we performed similar experiments using mouse pancreata from WT and ΔF mice. For these experiments, the amount of lysate used was adjusted to contain the same amount of NHE3 (Fig. 2 B). NHE3 was found in CFTR immunoprecipitates from the pancreas of WT mouse (Fig.2 D). In contrast, only a very small amount of NHE3 was found in CFTR immunoprecipitates from the pancreas of ΔF mouse. The small amount of NHE3 found to associate with ΔF508 CFTR can be accounted for by the small amount of CFTR that is found in the luminal membrane of these mice (22Zeng W. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R. Freedman S. Cotton C. Muallem S. Thomas P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The findings in Fig. 2 provide the first evidence that NHE3 and CFTR exist in the same multiprotein complex, both in model systems and in native cells. To study the effect of CFTR on NHE3 activity, we first determined the optimal conditions to study this interaction. In previous work, the cAMP-dependent and EBP50-mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity was studied in serum-deprived, Go/G1-arrested PS120 cells that were transfected with EBP50 (13Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the results of similar experiments in our PS120/NHE3 cells. Serum deprivation for 18 h increased NHE3 activity by ∼41%. This is attributable to an increase in NHE3 expression under these conditions. 2O. W. Moe, unpublished observation. Exogenous overexpression of EBP50 in PS120/NHE3 cells reduced NHE3 activity in unstimulated cells by ∼35%. Preliminary studies showed that the optimal experimental condition to consistently observe regulation of NHE3 by CFTR is to maintain the PS120/NHE3 cells in 10% serum and to rely on the EBP50 already expressed in the cells. Having established optimal conditions for measuring NHE3 activity in PS120 fibroblasts, we next examined the effect of increased cAMP on NHE3 activity of control PS120/NHE3 cells and cells transfected with CFTR (Fig. 4). Treatment of PS120/NHE3 cells with forskolin dose-dependently inhibited NHE3 activity. At 0.1 and 10 μm forskolin, NHE3 activity of PS120/NHE3 cells was 91.6 ± 6.1 and 70.8 ± 5.1% of control, respectively. Importantly, expression of CFTR had no effect on basal NHE3 activity (rates of pHi recovery: 0.86 ± 0.09 ΔpH/min (n = 6) in control and 0.94 ± 0.10 ΔpH/min (n = 9) in CTFR-expressing PS120/NHE3 cells). Incubation of CFTR-expressing PS120/NHE3 cells with forskolin also inhibited NHE3 activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, the inhibition was nearly maximal at 0.1 μmforskolin; at 0.1 and 10 μm forskolin, NHE3 activity in CFTR-expressing cells was 60.3 ± 5.1 and 53.4 ± 6.2% of control, respectively. Thus, we conclude that activation of CFTR augments cAMP-mediated inhibition of NHE3. Fig. 4 shows that CFTR markedly augments the inhibition of NHE3 by cAMP. CFTR binds to EBP50 through its C-terminal DTRL sequence, a signature PDZ domain-binding motif (10Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J.

To provide further evidence for a functional linkage between ZNF202 and hypoalphalipoproteinemia, we investigated the effect of ZNF202 expression on ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1. ABCA1 is a key regulator of the plasma high density lipoprotein pool size, whereas ABCG1 is another mediator of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux in human macrophage. We demonstrate here that the full-length ZNF202m1 isoform binds to GnT repeats within the promotors of ABCA1 (−229/−210) and ABCG1 (−572/−552). ZNF202m1 expression in HepG2 cells dose-dependently repressed the promotor activities of ABCA1 and ABCG1. This transcriptional effect required the presence of the SCAN domain in ZNF202 and the functional integrity of a TATA box at position −24 of ABCA1, whereas the presence of GnT binding motifs was nonessential. The state of ZNF202 SCAN domain oligomerization affected the ability of the adjacent ZNF202 Krüppel-associated box domain to recruit the transcriptional corepressor KAP1. Overexpression of ZNF202m1 in RAW264.7 macrophages prevented the induction of ABCA1 gene expression by 20(S)OH-cholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid, further substantiating the interference of ZNF202 in critical elements of transcriptional activation. Finally, HDL and apoAImediated lipid efflux was significantly reduced in RAW264.7 cells stably expressing ZNF202m1.

This novel familial susceptibility locus for hypoalphalipoproteinemia contains the zinc finger protein 202 (ZNF202) originally described as a testis-specific transcription factor (9Wagner S.

The m1 splice form encodes a full-length protein of 648 amino acids with an amino-terminal SCAN domain, a central KRAB repression domain, and 8 carboxyl-terminal Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs. The m3 splice form encodes a carboxyl-terminal-truncated protein of 133 amino acids that contains only the SCAN domain. The SCAN domain of ZNF202 has been shown to mediate selective protein oligomerization and the zinc finger motifs to bind to specific DNA elements (9Wagner S. Hess M.A. Ormonde H.P. Malandro J. Hu H.

Intriguingly, the ZNF202 DNA binding elements are present in promotors of various genes involved in lipid metabolism including apolipoproteins and lipid-processing enyzmes. ZNF202 has been therefore proposed to function as a transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism (9Wagner S. Hess M.A. Ormonde H.P. Malandro J. Hu H. Chen M. Kehrer R. Frodsham M. Schumacher C.

Based on this information, we tested the hypothesis of whether the ABC lipid transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 are transcriptionally regulated by ZNF202. Our results provide evidence that ZNF202 acts as a transcriptional repressor of both ABCA1 and ABCG1 and, thus, establish a functional link between ZNF202 and hypoalphalipoproteinemia. high density lipoprotein ATP binding cassette apolipoprotein zinc finger protein Krüppel-associated box KRAB-associated protein 1 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SCAN domain protein 1 glutathioneS-transferase"

However, the role of mammalian SPRY proteins has not been clearly elucidated. We postulated that human Sprouty2 (hSPRY2) is an inhibitor of cellular migration and proliferation. Indeed, using stably transfected HeLa cells, which expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged hSPRY2 or hSPRY2 tagged at the C terminus with red fluorescent protein, we demonstrated that hSPRY2 inhibits the migration of cells in response to serum, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Additionally, hSPRY2 also inhibited the growth of HeLa cells in response to serum. Previously, two C-terminal domains on hSPRY2, which are necessary for its colocalization with microtubules (residues 123–177) or translocation to membrane ruffles (residues 178–194), have been identified (Lim, J., Wong, E. S., Ong, S. H., Yusoff, P., Low, B. C., and Guy, G. R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 32837–32845). Therefore, using TAT-tagged hSPRY2 and its mutants, we determined the role of these two C-terminal domains in the inhibition of cell migration and proliferation. Our data show that the deletion of either of these two regions in hSPRY2 abrogates its ability to modulate cell migration in response to different growth factors and proliferation in response to serum. Therefore, we conclude that hSPRY2 inhibits the actions of a number of growth factors, and its C terminus, which is homologous among various SPRY isoforms, is important in mediating its biological activity.

Thus, in DrosophilaSprouty mutants, the fibroblast growth factor pathway is overactive, and excessive branching is seen in Drosophila airways (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Kramer et al. (2Kramer S. Okabe M. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Hiromi Y. Development. 1999; 126: 2515-2525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown antagonistic actions of Sprouty on both the FGF and EGF signaling pathways in Drosophila, where loss of Sprouty results in supernumerary neurons and glia. In addition, overexpression of Sprouty in wing veins and ovarian follicle cells, tissues where EGF signaling is required for proper patterning, results in phenotypes that resemble the loss-of-function phenotypes of EGF receptors (3Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sprouty has also been shown to interfere with chick embryo development. Hence, infection of the prospective wing territory with a retrovirus containing the Sprouty gene inhibits proper limb growth and formation in the embryonic chick (5Minowada G. Jarvis L.A. Chi C.L. Neubuser A. Sun X. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Martin G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Sprouty acts as an antagonist of both FGF and EGF receptor signaling pathways. To date, four isoforms of mammalian Sprouty protein have been described (SPRY1–SPRY4) (1, 4-6). Among these, only partial clones of SPRY1 and SPRY3 are available. The mouse as well as human SPRY2 (hSPRY2) and mouse SPRY4 have been cloned (4Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6de Maximy A.A. Nakatake Y.

However, their N termini are different. By Northern analysis the mouse SPRY2 mRNA is most abundant in brain, lung, and heart followed by kidney and skeletal muscle (7Tefft J.D. Lee M. Smith S. Leinwand M. Zhao J. Bringas Jr., P. Crowe D.L. Warburton D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Despite their role in Drosophila and chick development, relatively little is known about the biological actions of the mammalian Sprouty proteins. Recently, one study (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that upon activation of cells by EGF, hSPRY2 is translocated from the vicinity of microtubules to membrane ruffles. Moreover, this translocation of hSPRY2 from microtubules to the membrane ruffles is dependent upon certain portions of the C terminus. However, the functional role of hSPRY2, its colocalization with tubulin in microtubules, and its translocation remain to be described. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the functional role of hSPRY2 in growth factor actions and determine whether the translocation sequence on this protein alters its activity. Our data show that in cells that are either transfected or transduced to express hSPRY2, the migration in response to serum and a variety of growth factors is attenuated. Additionally, serum-induced proliferation of cells expressing hSPRY2 is also markedly inhibited. Moreover, our data show that deletion of regions in the C terminus, which has been shown to disrupt either the colocalization of hSPRY2 with tubulin or its translocation to membrane ruffles, obliterates the biological actions of the protein. Full-length hSPRY2 was cloned from two expressed sequence tag clones (accession numbers AA305092 and AA431912) using the unique AflII site in their overlapping sequence. The full-length clone was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified with a forward primer containing KpnI and BamHI sites (5-TATATATA GGTACCGGATCC GAG GCC AGA GCT CAG AGT GGC-3) and a reverse primer containing a stop codon as well as XhoI and EcoRI sites (5-ATATAT GAATTCCTCGAGTTACTA TGT TGG TTT TTC AAA GTT CCT-3). This PCR product was digested withKpnI/EcoRI and ligated to theKpnI/EcoRI site of pRSET B. To generate a construct to express hemagglutinin (HA)-hSPRY2, the full-length hSPRY2 cDNA from pRSET B was digested withKpnI/EcoRI and subcloned into theKpnI/EcoRI sites of HA-tag-containing mammalian expression vector pHM6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To construct a TAT-HA-hSPRY2 expression plasmid, the hSPRY2 cDNA in pRSET B was digested with KpnI/EcoRI and subcloned into the KpnI/EcoRI site of pTAT-HA bacterial expression vector (gift from Dr. Steven Dowdy, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Similarly, the cDNAs encoding hSPRY2 deletion mutants (Δ123-177 and Δ178-194), which were generated by PCR, were subcloned into the pTAT-HA expression vector using KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites. To express the C-terminal RFP-tagged hSPRY2, the full-length clone of hSPRY2 was amplified by PCR with a forward primer containing aXhoI site (5-TATATA CTCGAG ATG GAG GCC AGA GCT-3) and a KpnI site containing reverse primer (5-ATATATGGTACCGT TGG TTT TTC AAA GT-3) devoid of a stop codon. The PCR product was digested withXhoI and KpnI and inserted into theXhoI/KpnI sites of the RFP expression mammalian vector pDsRed1-N1 (CLONTECH). All hSPRY2 constructs were sequenced fully for tag and sequence verification. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotic for 2 days. The cells were transfected with plasmid constructs encoding HA-hSPRY2, hSPRY2-RFP, RFP alone, or vector alone using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty-four hours later, cells were grown in media supplemented with the antibiotic Geneticin (G418, BioWhittaker) at 200-800 μg/ml, and selection of clonal cell lines was initiated. Individual G418-resistant clones were expanded and maintained in 800 μg/ml G418. Overexpression of HA-hSPRY2 was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Similarly, overexpression of hSPRY2-RFP was confirmed by fluorescence. The TAT-HA tag encodes for an N-terminal hexahistidyl leader followed by the 11-amino acid TAT protein transduction domain (YGRKKRRQRRR) and an HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) (9Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M.

The TAT-HA-hSPRY2 protein was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLys strain ofE. coli by induction with IPTG (0.4 mm) and overnight growth at 37 °C. TAT fusion proteins were purified after lysis of E. coli with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. Cellular lysates were resolved by centrifugation, loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, washed successively with buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5) containing 8 murea, 4 m urea, and buffer alone. Proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient (40 mm-1 m) in the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing TAT-HA-hSPRY2 were collected and pooled. This pool of TAT-HA-hSPRY2 protein was then desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After determining protein concentration, TAT-HA-hSPRY2 was stored in 10% glycerol at −80 °C. The deletion mutants of TAT-HA-hSPRY2 (Δ123-177 and Δ178-194) were also expressed and purified using the same methodologies. The plasmid pTAT-GFP was a gift from Dr. Steven Dowdy. TAT-GFP was expressed and purified from E. coli by methods similar to those described above for TAT-HA-hSPRY2. The peak fractions were identified by absorbance at 280 nm, pooled, applied to a PD-10 column, and eluted into PBS. Purified TAT-GFP was stored in 10% glycerol at −80 °C until use. Cell lysates were separated on polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and incubated in 5% milk in PBS. The membrane was incubated in primary antibody (anti-HA, HA.11 from Covance Research Products, 1:400 dilution) for 1.5 h at 37 °C followed by secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, 1:5000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. Cells were grown on glass coverslips to ∼75% confluence. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed by exposure to 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the coverslips were blocked overnight with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The coverslips were exposed to a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HA antibody for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with a 1:500 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and mounted. For fluorescence analysis of RFP, hSPRY2-RFP, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled TAT-tagged proteins;Cy-3 conjugated anti-tubulin antibody (tubulin), and filamentous actin (Texas red isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, Sigma), cells were rinsed in Dulbecco's PBS (BioWhittaker), followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and mounted. Immunofluorescence was detected using a Bio-Rad 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 system. Migration of cells was measured using a monolayer wounding protocol (“scratch wound” assay) in which cells migrate from a confluent area to an area that has been mechanically denuded of cells using a razor blade (12Brown C. Pan X. Hassid A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Essentially, confluent cells were treated with serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h before the start of the experiment. After serum starvation, cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and a scratch was made in the dish of cells using a sterile, single-edged razor blade. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and treated with the experimental medium. Sixteen h later, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The number of cells migrating was then monitored by counting the number of cells in a field that had migrated beyond the line of scratch. At least three fields per dish were counted, and in each experiment and each condition, migration was monitored in three different dishes. Stable clones expressing either HA-hSPRY2 or hSPRY2-RFP were plated in triplicate (100,000 cells/60-mm dish) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cells were then trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer as described by Lu and Serrero (13Lu R. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3993-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Initially, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmid encoding either HA-hSPRY2 or hSPRY2-RFP and selected several clones. Several G418-resistant clones were isolated. Fig.1 A shows a Western blot of several stable cell lines which either expressed HA-hSPRY 2 (clones 3 and 9) or were G418-resistant but did not express HA-hSPRY2 (clones 5 and 8). Fluorescence microscopy was also used to confirm the presence of HA-hSPRY2 by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy, several clones expressing hSPRY2-RFP were also isolated. An example is shown in Fig.1 B with hSPRY-2RFP. Compared with control cells expressing RFP alone, hSPRY2-RFP was exclusively located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B); RFP was distributed in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm. This would suggest that the hSPRY2 is responsible for the differential localization of RFP and hSPRY2-RFP (Fig.1 B). This contention is supported by the similar localization of HA-hSPRY2 (Fig. 1 B). Lim et al.(8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in COS-1 cells, hSPRY2 is localized in proximity to the microtubules, resulting in similar staining. Thus, the localization of the tagged hSPRY2 proteins in our cells is similar to that reported previously in Lim et al. (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, our data (Fig. 1 B) demonstrate that neither the N terminus (HA) tag nor the C terminus (RFP) tag interferes with the location of hSPRY2 in cells. Because the Drosophila SPRY has been shown to be important for tracheal formation and branching by opposing the actions of EGF and FGF (2Kramer S. Okabe M. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Hiromi Y. Development. 1999; 126: 2515-2525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we postulated that hSPRY2 would inhibit growth factor actions and disrupt the migration of HeLa cells. For this purpose, we utilized the scratch wound assay. As shown in Fig.2 A, control cells, which were G418-resistant but did not express hSPRY2 (e.g. HA-control, Fig. 1 A), did not migrate in serum-free medium but demonstrated increased migration when exposed to either 10% serum or 100 nm EGF. Similar results (not shown) were obtained with a second clone, which does not express HA-hSPRY2 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to these findings, however, when cells expressing HA-hSPRY2 were exposed to either serum or EGF, no migration was observed (Fig. 2 A). Results similar to those shown for HA-hSPRY2 (Fig. 2 A) were also observed with another clone, which also expresses HA-hSPRY2 (not shown). In additional migration assays, the ability of hSPRY2 to modulate the migration of HeLa cells in response to a variety of growth factors was tested. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in control G418-resistant cells not expressing HA-hSPRY2, serum, EGF, PDGF, and FGF markedly enhanced migration of HeLa cells. However, in HA-hSPRY2-expressing cells, migration in response to serum, EGF, PDGF, and FGF was inhibited (Fig.2 B). Likewise, in hSPRY2-RFP-expressing cells, but not in control cells expressing RFP alone, migration in response to serum, EGF, PDGF, and FGF was inhibited (Fig. 2 C). These data demonstrate that hSPRY2 opposes the migration-enhancing actions of a number of growth factors in HeLa cells. Moreover, the data in Fig. 2show that the N- and C-terminal tags in SPRY do not interfere with its ability to inhibit migration in response to a variety of stimuli. Because hSPRY2 inhibited migration in response to a number of mitogenic growth factors and serum, we assessed the effects of hSPRY2 on proliferation of HeLa cells in response to serum. In HA-hSPRY2- (Fig.3 A) and hSPRY2-RFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3 B), the ability of serum to induce growth was markedly attenuated. Therefore, as observed with the cell migration assay, the N- and C-terminal tags do not alter the ability of hSPRY2 to inhibit cell proliferation. Lim et al. (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that in COS-1 cells growth factors such as EGF translocate hSPRY2 from the proximity of microtubules to membrane ruffles. Moreover, these authors demonstrated that the deletion of amino acids 178-194 in hSPRY2 abolishes this translocation without changing the colocalization of hSPRY2 in the proximity of microtubules (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deletion of amino acids 123-177 selectively disrupts the colocalization of hSPRY2 with tubulin without altering its translocation in response to growth factor (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, using the deletion mutants described by Lim et al. (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) we investigated whether the regions of hSPRY2 that are important for colocalization with tubulin and translocation are important for the functional effects of hSPRY2 on cell migration and proliferation. To facilitate these studies, we employed the approach of transducing proteins into cells. It has been demonstrated that the addition of an 11-amino acid sequence from the TAT protein of human immunodeficiency virus in the N terminus of proteins permits their transport across cell membranes, and cells readily take up the protein of interest (9Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 10Schwarze S.R. Ho A.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 2: 508-521Crossref Google Scholar). By this method, more than 50 proteins ranging in size from 15kDa to 115kDa have been shown to be successfully transduced into cells (14Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 15Vocero-Akbani A. Lissy N.A. Dowdy S.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 2: 508-521Crossref Google Scholar). There are several advantages to this approach. First, transduction is achieved in nearly 100% of the cells ((15) and data not shown). Therefore, one does not have to select clonal lines and assay these. Second, the proteins enter the cell very rapidly (9Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 10Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 2: 508-521Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, 10 min after the cells were exposed to TAT-HA-hSPRY2, the protein was detected inside the cells by Western analysis (Fig.4 A). Similarly, as monitored by fluorescence, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled TAT-HA-hSPRY2 and its C-terminal deletion mutants were observed inside the cells after exposing the cells to the protein for 30 min and up to 24 h (Fig.4 B). It should be noted that for the experiments in Fig. 4,A and B, the cells were extensively washed to remove the TAT-HA-hSPRY2 or its deletion mutants that may have adhered to the outside of the cells. Moreover, the proteins were visualized by confocal microscopy, and several “z” plane images demonstrated that the fluorescent tagged proteins were located in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Next we investigated whether the TAT-HA-hSPRY2, like its FLAG-tagged counterpart (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), colocalized with microtubules and was translocated to membrane ruffles in the presence of growth factors such as EGF. We could not detect membrane ruffling in HeLa cells under any experimental condition, and therefore, these experiments were performed in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells are identical to the COS-1 cells that Lim et al. (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) had used to characterize the cellular localization and translocation of hSPRY2. As shown in Fig.5 A, TAT-HA-hSPRY2 was colocalized with tubulin, a microtubule component. On the other hand, the deletion mutant TAT-HA-hSPRY2Δ123-177 was not colocalized with tubulin to the same extent as was the full-length TAT-HA-hSPRY2 (Fig.5 A). These results demonstrate that the TAT-tagged proteins localized like their FLAG-tagged counterparts (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, after treatment with EGF for 10 min, the TAT-HA-hSPRY2, but not its deletion mutant TAT-HA-hSPRY2Δ178-194, translocated to membrane ruffles (Fig.5 B) as described for the FLAG-tagged hSPRY2 (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In these latter experiments, translocation of filamentous actin to the membrane ruffles in response to EGF was used as a positive control (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This control also permitted the colocalization of filamentous actin with TAT-HA-hSPRY2 in membrane ruffles to be discerned. Having shown that the TAT-tagged hSPRY2 and its deletion mutants were behaving like their FLAG-tagged counterparts, we investigated whether these proteins alter migration and proliferation of HeLa cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 A, in cells exposed to TAT-HA-hSPRY2, the migration in response to serum, EGF, PDGF, and FGF was markedly diminished compared with control cells, which were exposed to TAT-tagged GFP. These data demonstrate that the TAT-HA-hSPRY2 was inhibiting cells in the same manner as that observed with transfected HA-hSPRY2 (c.f. Figs. 2 B and6 A). Additionally, because the TAT-GFP-transduced cells did not alter migration (c.f. controls in Figs. 2 Band 6 A), our data show that the effects of TAT-HA-hSPRY2 on cell migration cannot be attributed to the TAT tag. Most interestingly, our data demonstrated that when cells were transduced with either hSPRY2Δ123-177 or hSPRY2Δ178-194 the inhibitory effect of the protein on cell migration in response to growth factors and serum was obliterated. Because residues 123-177 and 178-194 in hSPRY2 are necessary for colocalization with microtubules and translocation to membrane ruffles, respectively (8Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it would follow that the disruption of either of these functions obliterates the activity of SPRY as an inhibitor of cell migration in response to growth factors and serum. To test the effects of the deletion mutants of hSPRY2 on cell proliferation, the experiment depicted in Fig. 6 B was performed. Similar to our findings with the migration assay, in cells exposed to TAT-HA-hSPRY2 proliferation in response to serum was attenuated. This is similar to the findings with cells overexpressing HA-hSPRY2 and hSPRY2-RFP (Fig. 3). However, in cells transduced with hSPRY2Δ123-177 and hSPRY2Δ178-194, serum-induced cell growth was not altered. Therefore, as discussed above for cell migration, these latter data also demonstrate that the C-terminal regions encompassed by amino acids 123-177 and 178-194 in hSPRY2 are necessary to observe inhibition of cell growth. Although SPRY has been shown to be important in modulating the actions of growth factors in the Drosophila and chicken, the role of SPRY2 in mammalian systems has remained unknown. More elusive has been the determination of the mechanism(s) and signaling pathways involved in the actions of SPRY. Therefore, the identification of hSPRY2 as a modulator of migration and proliferation is a starting point in the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the actions of this protein. It has been shown previously that Drosophila SPRY associates with the Grb2 homologues Drk and Gab1 and that the Ras pathway below the activation of Ras may be the locus of SPRY action (3Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 4Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in mammalian cells is the target of hSPRY2 is a question that remains to be resolved. Interestingly, among the various isoforms of SPRY, the N-terminal domains are different, but the C terminus is similar. Because the C-terminal domains that are conserved are important in the actions of hSPRY2 as an inhibitor of cell migration and proliferation, it would appear that these functions may be displayed by all isoforms of SPRY in different species. Indeed, lack of this inhibitory action in SPRY mutants of Drosophila would explain the excessive branching of trachea (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). We used HeLa cells in our studies because we were interested in determining whether hSPRY2 inhibits the migration and/or proliferation of transformed carcinoma cells. Because the migration of HeLa cells may be an index of their metastatic capacity, it would be tempting to speculate that hSPRY2 may decrease the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Likewise, one would predict that in cells that proliferate and migrate very rapidly, the amount of hSPRY2 protein may be decreased. Presently, there are no antibodies available that can detect the endogenously expressed hSPRY2 in HeLa or other cell types. However, using reverse transcription-PCR methodology, we did detect endogenous hSPRY2 mRNA in HeLa cells (data not shown). Whether the amount of this transcript and its protein are regulated by specific growth factors or other stimuli remains to be determined. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that hSPRY2 is an inhibitor of cell migration in response to a number of growth factors and also exerts anti-proliferative actions. These actions of hSPRY2 require the domains in the molecule that have been shown previously to be necessary for colocalization with tubulin in microtubules or translocation of hSPRY2 to the ruffles. The deletion of either of these latter domains of hSPRY2 obliterates its ability to inhibit migration and cell proliferation. Because hSPRY2 inhibits cell migration in response to several growth factors it appears to be a general inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, because the conserved C-terminal domains are important for SPRY function and because these regions are conserved in the different isoforms, our data suggest that all SPRY isoforms may inhibit migration and proliferation of cells. After acceptance of this article for publication, two other groups have reported that Spry4 (Lee, S. H., Schloss, D. J., Jarvis, L., Krasnow, M. A., and Swain, J. L. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 4128–4133) and SPRY-1 and -2 (Impagnatiello, M. A., Weitzer, S., Gannon, G., Compagni, A., Cotten, M., and Christofori, G. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 152,1087–1098) inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Thus the inhibition of cellular migration and proliferation by SPRY proteins may be a general phenomenon. We thank Dr. Steven Dowdy for providing the pTAT-HA plasmid and the pTAT-GFP construct. We also thank Dr. Mark Krasnow, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, for his help in verifying the published nucleotide and protein sequences of mouse and human SPRY2.

Receptor-mediated activation involves direct effects of Gβγ subunits on GIRK channels, but mechanisms involved in GIRK channel inhibition have not been fully elucidated. An HEK293 cell line that stably expresses GIRK1/4 channels was used to test G protein mechanisms that mediate GIRK channel inhibition. In cells transiently or stably cotransfected with 5-HT1A(Gαi/o-coupled) and TRH-R1 (Gαq-coupled) receptors, 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine; serotonin) enhanced GIRK channel currents, whereas thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) inhibited both basal and 5-HT-activated GIRK channel currents. Inhibition of GIRK channel currents by TRH primarily involved signaling by Gαqfamily subunits, rather than Gβγ dimers: GIRK channel current inhibition was diminished by Pasteurella multocida toxin, mimicked by constitutively active members of the Gαqfamily, and reduced by minigene constructs that disrupt Gαq signaling, but was completely preserved in cells expressing constructs that interfere with signaling by Gβγ subunits. Inhibition of GIRK channel currents by TRH and constitutively active Gαq was reduced by U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC). Moreover, TRH- R1-mediated GIRK channel inhibition was diminished by minigene constructs that reduce membrane levels of the PLC substrate phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, further implicating PLC. However, we found no evidence for involvement of protein kinase C, inositol trisphosphate, or intracellular calcium. Although these downstream signaling intermediaries did not contribute to receptor-mediated GIRK channel inhibition, bath application of TRH decreased GIRK channel activity in cell-attached patches. Together, these data indicate that receptor-mediated inhibition of GIRK channels involves PLC activation by Gα subunits of the Gαqfamily and suggest that inhibition may be communicated at a distance to GIRK channels via unbinding and diffusion of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate away from the channel.

Activation of GIRK channels involves receptors that couple to pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive Gα subunits of the Gαi or Gαo family, whereas inhibition of GIRK channels is mediated by receptors that couple via PTx-insensitive Gα subunits. This dual regulation of GIRK channels has been noted in a number of cellular contexts, including atrial cells of the myocardium (3Braun A.P. Fedida D. Giles W.R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 421: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4Yamaguchi H. Sakamoto N. Watanabe Y. Saito T. Masuda Y. Nakaya H. Am. J.

Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 1632-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because demonstration of this dual regulation requires simultaneous activation of different receptor classes, the phenomenon may be even more widespread than is currently realized. Of the dual components of receptor-mediated GIRK channel regulation (activation and inhibition), most emphasis has been on understanding cellular mechanisms underlying GIRK channel activation. It is now well established that, following agonist stimulation, Gβγ subunits released from receptor-bound heterotrimers bind directly to GIRK channels to increase channel activity (reviewed in Refs. 1Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, and 8Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). It was recently found that Gβγ activation of GIRK channels requires permissive levels of membrane phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) and that interactive effects of these mediators on channel activity result from Gβγ-mediated stabilization of PIP2 binding to GIRK channels (9Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In contrast to GIRK channel activation, mechanisms that contribute to receptor-mediated inhibition of GIRK channels are not well understood. It is clear that GIRK channel inhibition involves receptors that typically couple via PTx-insensitive G proteins of the Gαq family, and it therefore seems reasonable to suspect involvement of that class of Gα subunit. However, GIRK channel inhibition by these and/or other classes of PTx-insensitive Gα subunits has not been directly examined. Moreover, it remains to be determined if the signal for GIRK channel inhibition derives from the α subunit or βγ dimer of the heterotrimeric G protein. In this respect, we recently found that Gβ5-containing dimers can inhibit Gβγ-activated GIRK channels (12Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a finding that is especially intriguing in the current context of receptor-mediated GIRK channel inhibition since Gβ5γ dimers associate preferentially with Gαq-coupled receptors (13Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S.

Signaling mechanisms that contribute to GIRK channel inhibition downstream of G protein subunits are also not known with any certainty, although recently it was suggested that phospholipase C (PLC) activation could contribute to GIRK channel inhibition by Gαq-coupled receptors in atrial myocytes by decreasing membrane levels of PIP2 rather than by production of downstream mediators (15Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Cho H. Nam G.-B. Lee S.H. Earm Y.E. Ho W.-K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5650-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined if a similar mechanism contributes to GIRK channel inhibition by similar receptors in other settings. Here, we prepared mammalian cell lines expressing GIRK channel subunits together with two different classes of G protein-coupled receptors in order to recapitulate dual regulation of GIRK channels in a heterologous expression system. Using this system, we found that Gαq-coupled thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) type 1 (TRH-R1) receptors can inhibit GIRK channels pre-activated by Gαi/o-coupled 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) type 1A (5-HT1A) receptors. GIRK channel inhibition involved Gαq family subunits, PIP2, and activation of PLC, but it was independent of downstream signaling mediators typically associated with PLC activation such as protein kinase C (PKC), inositol trisphosphate (IP3), and intracellular calcium. These data are consistent with the possibility that PLC-mediated decreases in membrane PIP2 levels provide the signal for GIRK channel inhibition by Gαq-coupled receptors (15Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Cho H. Nam G.-B. Lee S.H. Earm Y.E. Ho W.-K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5650-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); if this is the case, PIP2 may be readily diffusible since inhibition was robust even in cell-attached patches that were not exposed to agonist. These results further indicate that Gα and Gβγ subunits, each derived from a different class of receptor, can converge with opposite effects on the same channel to dynamically regulate cellular excitability. The derivation and maintenance of stable human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells expressing GIRK1 (Kir3.1) and GIRK4 (Kir3.4) channels (referred to as G1/4 cells) were described previously (12Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This cell line was further stably transfected with the TRH-R1 and 5-HT1A receptors (referred to as G1/4R cells). Briefly, TRH-R1 (pBS; M. C. Gershengorn, Cornell University) and 5-HT1A receptor (pGEM3z; D. K. Grandy, Vollum Institute) cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 and transfected together with pBabe-Puro (K. R. Lynch, University of Virginia) into G1/4 cells and maintained under G418 (400 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) and puromycin (200 ng/ml; Sigma) selection. A G418- and puromycin-resistant cell line was selected based on strong expression of inwardly rectifying K+ currents and robust regulation of those currents by TRH and 5-HT (G1/4R cells). Both the G1/4 and G1/4R cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in the continued presence of G418 (G1/4 cells) or G418 and puromycin (G1/4R cells). Stable cell lines (G1/4 and G1/4R) were transiently transfected with plasmids that direct expression of Gα, Gβ, or Gγ subunits or of minigene constructs that interfere with G protein signaling under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Gα subunits that bear a point mutation (Gln → Leu) rendering them GTPase-deficient (i.e. constitutively active, indicated as Gα*) were used as follows: Gαq* (in pcDNA3; W. F. Simonds, National Institutes of Health) and FLAG epitope-tagged Gαq* (in pSKAC; R. Iyengar, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, NY); Gα11* (in pCI; M. I. Simon, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA); wild-type Gα14 (in pCIS; M. I. Simon), mutated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction to yield Q205L, subcloned into pcDNA3, and sequenced; Gα15* (in pBS; M. I. Simon), subcloned into pcDNA3; Gαi1*, Gαi3*, and Gαz* (in pCMV5; H. Itoh, National Children's Medical Research Center, Tokyo, Japan); Gαi2* (in pCMV7; G. L. Johnson, National Jewish Medical and Research Center); Gαo* (in pBS; B. M. Denker, Harvard University), subcloned into pcDNA3; Gαs* and Gα12* (both in pCMV5; G. L. Johnson); Gα13* (in pcDNA3; M. Negishi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan); and Gβ5 and Gγ2(in pcDNA3; W. F. Simonds). The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PLCβ1-ct (where ct is the C-terminal domain; pEGFP-C1) and RGS2 (pCI) Gαq effector antagonist constructs were obtained from S. R. Ikeda (Guthrie Research Institute) (18Kammermeier P.J. Ikeda S.R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two RGS constructs (RGS6 and RGS11) that bind specifically to Gβ5 (19Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained in pcDNA3.1 (A. G. Gilman, University of Texas-Southwestern). Two additional constructs that interfere generally with Gβγ signaling were also used: a β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) C-terminal domain construct, βARK-ct (in pRK5; W. J. Koch, Duke University), was subcloned in frame with a myristic acid attachment signal into pGTM, a pcDNA3 derivative (E. A. Golemis, Fox Chase Cancer Center) (22Toby G. Law S.F. Golemis E.A. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); and Gαt(transducin) was obtained in pcDNA1 (F. L. Kolakowski, University of Texas at San Antonio). GFP-tagged constructs designed to decrease membrane PIP2 levels (PLCδ-PH (where PH is the pleckstrin homology domain), AKT-PH, and 5′-phosphatidylinositol phosphatase (5′-PI-PTase)), provided by T. Meyer (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), were as previously described (23Raucher D. Stauffer T. Chen W. Shen K. Guo S. York J.D. Sheetz M.P. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 100: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids were transfected in 35-mm culture dishes by CaPO4precipitation (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) together with a plasmid (pGreenLantern, Life Technologies, Inc.) that directs expression of an enhanced GFP at a test plasmid/GFP plasmid ratio of 6:1 μg. Crude cell lysates were prepared from transfected cells in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted. Expression of FLAG epitope-tagged constitutively active Gαq subunits (FLAG-Gαq*) was detected using M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antisera (10 μg/ml; Sigma), and GIRK channel subunit expression was determined with a rabbit anti-GIRK1 antibody (1:500 dilution; Alomone Labs). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG using enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips at a confluency appropriate to obtain single cells for electrical recording 48–72 h after transfection (except where noted). Coverslips were submerged in a recording chamber at room temperature on microscopes equipped with epifluorescent optics (Zeiss Axioskop FS or Nikon TE300). Individual cells that expressed GFP were identified using standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets and targeted for recording. Patch electrodes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical) and connected to the head stage of an Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). For whole cell recordings, pipettes (2–4 megaohms) were filled with an internal solution containing 120 mm KCH3O3S, 4 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgATP, and 0.3 mmTris-GTP (pH 7.2). The external solution contained 137 mmNaCl, 6 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.3). For cell-attached patch recordings, the same external solution was used, but pipettes were pulled to a higher resistance (7–10 megaohms) and contained 130 mmKCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Electrophysiological data were acquired and analyzed using the pCLAMP suite of programs (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Series resistance was typically <10 megaohms and compensated by ∼70–80%. Membrane voltages were corrected for a 10-mV liquid junction potential. To record inwardly rectifying whole cell currents, cells were held at −50 mV, and a slow voltage ramp command (Δ−90 mV, 0.1 V/s) was applied at 0.1 Hz. Membrane current was filtered at 0.5–1 kHz and sampled at 1–2 kHz. Measured variables included holding current at −50 mV and slope conductance, obtained from a linear fit to current-voltage data over the range of −100 to −120 mV. The effect of TRH on GIRK channel conductance was determined following subtraction of endogenous currents, defined by their resistance to 0.2 mmBa2+. Single channel data were filtered at 2 kHz (four-pole Bessel) and collected on line using gap-free recording with a 10-kHz sampling frequency. The slope of current amplitudes obtained from gaussian fits to all-points histograms at three different patch potentials was used to determine single channel conductance. Analysis of the effects of agonist stimulation on GIRK channel activity in cell-attached patches was performed using Fetchan (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and the nPo freeware program (provided by J. L. Sui). All data are presented as means ± S.E., and each data point includes results obtained from at least two transfections. Compounds were prepared as concentrated stock solutions, stored at −20 °C, and diluted to the indicated concentrations in recording or pipette solutions, as needed. 5-HT (serotonin, Sigma) was made up as a 10 mm stock solution with 100 mm ascorbate and applied to cells at 50 μm. TRH (100 μm stock solution; Peninsula Laboratories, Inc.) was applied at 100 nm. Toxins fromBordetella pertussis (132 μg/ml) and Pasteurella multocida (50 μg/ml) were generously provided, respectively, by E. L. Hewlett (University of Virginia) and L. J. Eaton (List Biological Laboratories, Inc.); cells were incubated in toxins overnight at 2 and 1 μg/ml, respectively. The PLC inhibitor U73122and its inactive analog, U73343, were obtained from Research Biochemicals Inc. and prepared as 2 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide; preincubation with U73122 or U73443 (both at 1 μm) in the culture medium was begun at least 30 min prior to recording to test effects on receptor-mediated GIRK channel inhibition and ∼36–48 h before recording to test effects in cells transfected with Gαq*. The bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitor (GF 109203X, Calbiochem) was stored as a 5 mmstock solution, and continuous exposure to 5 μmbisindolylmaleimide was started ≥30 min before recording. The phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu; Research Biochemicals Inc.) and its inactive analog, 4α-PDBu (Alexis), were prepared as 1 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide and applied in the bath at 1 μm. IP3 (10 mm; Alexis) was diluted to 100 μm in pipette solution. To study mechanisms contributing to receptor-mediated inhibition of recombinant GIRK channels in the context of a mammalian cell system, we prepared a stable HEK293 cell line that expresses Kir3.1/3.4 (GIRK1/4) channels. As we described previously for G1/4 cells, hyperpolarizing ramp voltage commands evoked substantial inwardly rectifying currents under non-stimulated conditions that were due, in large part, to channel activation by free Gβγ subunits endogenous to those cells (12Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with the Gαi/o-coupled 5-HT1A receptor and Gαq-coupled TRH-R1, whether expressed transiently in G1/4 cells or stably in G1/4R cells, the dual regulation of GIRK channels that is seen in various native cell systems (5Farkas R.H.

Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 1632-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was fully recapitulated, i.e. GIRK channel currents pre-activated by Gαi/o-coupled receptors were inhibited by Gαq-coupled receptors. Thus, as illustrated in the representative cell of Fig.1 A, the basal inwardly rectifying conductance was increased by 5-HT (50 μm), and this enhanced conductance was inhibited by TRH (100 nm). Although it was often more convenient to use the G1/4R cell line stably expressing the 5-HT1A and TRH-R1 receptors, we obtained essentially identical results with transient receptor expression; therefore, where available, data from experiments using transient and stable receptor expression were combined. Averaged data from cells treated with both 5-HT and TRH (n = 9) revealed that 5-HT caused an increase in GIRK channel conductance (42.2 ± 8.7% of the initial conductance), whereas TRH inhibited GIRK channel conductance (80.4 ± 3.8% of the conductance in 5-HT); when referenced to the initial GIRK channel conductance before 5-HT, the inhibition by TRH was often >100% (average of 118.3 ± 11.5%,n = 9), indicating that signaling from 5-HT1A and TRH-R1 receptors converges on the same GIRK channels, but with opposite effects. It is well known that activation of GIRK channels by 5-HT1Aand other receptors in native systems is mediated by PTx-sensitive G proteins of the Gαi/o class. Likewise, we found that GIRK channel activation by 5-HT1A receptors was completely blocked by PTx (2 μg/ml, overnight; 56.2 ± 7.3% activation in control cells (n = 15) versus11.9 ± 3.8% inhibition after PTx (n = 16)). On the other hand, receptor-mediated GIRK channel inhibition in native systems is PTx-insensitive; and accordingly, we found no effect of PTx on TRH-induced GIRK channel inhibition (Fig.1 B, right panel). Because TRH-R1 is typically associated with G proteins of the Gαq family, we tested the effects of P. multocida toxin (PMT) (Fig. 1 B,left panel), which appears to directly activate and permanently uncouple Gαq subunits from receptors (25Wilson B.A. Zhu X. Ho M. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1268-1275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,26Bünemann M. Meyer T. Pott L. Hosey M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12537-12545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); compared with the typical TRH-induced inhibition of GIRK channel conductance in a control cell (closed circles), the inhibition by TRH was completely blocked in a representative cell treated with PMT (1 μg/ml, overnight; open circles). The degree of inhibition of GIRK channel conductance by TRH was >55% in nearly all control cells (38 of 41 cells tested; 93%), whereas it reached that level in only three PMT-treated cells (of 15 cells tested; 20%); as shown in Fig. 1 B (right panel), the averaged percent inhibition of GIRK channel conductance by TRH was significantly decreased by PMT (34.5 ± 5.7%,n = 15) compared with control cells (72.6 ± 2.0%, n = 41; p < 0.05). Thus, these data suggest that TRH-R1 couples to Gαq family subunits to mediate inhibition of GIRK channels. Receptor-mediated modulation of native GIRK channel currents is invariably associated with Gαq-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref. 1Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To determine if members of the Gαq family can cause inhibition of GIRK channels independent of receptor activation, we transfected constitutively active (i.e. GTPase-deficient, Gln → Leu mutant) Gαq* subunits into G1/4 cells. We chose to use constitutively active Gα subunits because effects of wild-type Gα subunits could result from promiscuous coupling to receptors; from activity due to intrinsic GDP/GTP cycling; or indirectly, from effects due to sequestering free Gβγ subunits. As evident in the sample records from representative cells shown in Fig. 2 A, basal GIRK channel currents were substantially smaller in a cell transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged Gαq* compared with a control G1/4 cell. Currents were essentially identical in cells transfected with either FLAG-tagged or untagged Gαq*, and data from experiments with those constructs were combined in subsequent analyses. As shown in the averaged data of Fig. 2 C, GIRK channel currents were significantly decreased in G1/4 cells transfected with Gαq*; indeed, the conductance in cells transfected with Gαq* approximated that seen in parental HEK293 cells not expressing GIRK channels (data not shown), suggesting that channel activity was essentially completely eliminated by Gαq*. Likewise, GIRK channel currents were drastically reduced in cells transfected with constitutively active mutants of all other Gαq family members tested, including Gα11*, Gα14*, and Gα15* (Fig. 2 C). Expression of GIRK channel subunits was apparently unaffected by Gαq* transfection inasmuch as we found no difference in GIRK1 levels by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A,inset). In addition, this inhibitory effect was specific to Gαq family subunits since GIRK channel currents were unaffected by representative constitutively active members of all other major classes of Gα proteins. These included all members of the Gαi/o family (Gαi1*, Gαi2*, Gαi3*, and Gαo*) as well as the PTx-insensitive Gαs*, Gα12*, Gα13*, and Gαz* subunits (Fig.2 C). Gβγ subunits also convey signaling information to effectors following receptor activation (reviewed in Refs. 1Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, and 8Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Many Gβ and Gγ subunit genes have been identified by molecular cloning, and it is now well established that multiple different combinations of Gβγ are capable of activating GIRK channels, including dimers composed of Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3, and Gβ4, together with various Gγ subunits (12Lei Q.

By contrast, we recently found that Gβ5 forms Gβγ dimers that cause inhibition, rather than the customary Gβγ-mediated activation of GIRK channel currents (12Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M.

The activation of the MAPK pathway occurs through ligand-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinases that results in receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation (1Heldin C.H.

For MAPK or Erk activation, in general, receptor phosphorylation leads to the binding of Grb2/SOS and activation of Ras, which in turn activates the kinase cascade consisting of Raf, its target MEK1/2 (MAP/Erk kinase), followed by MAPK activation. Activated MEK1/2 phosphorylates Thr183 and Tyr185 of p42/p44 MAPK rendering the kinase active such that it phosphorylates cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates (reviewed in Refs. 2Davis R.J. J. Biol.

MAPK is strongly activated by many mitogens, suggesting these kinases may play an important role in cell proliferation, and by inference, a negative role in differentiation for appropriate cell types. Somewhat paradoxically, however, the sustained activation of MAPK's appears to be necessary for the differentiation and neurite outgrowth process in the PC12 neuronal cell line (5Peraldi P.

Also, co-injection of MAPK with the dual-specificity phosphatase MAP kinase phosphatase-1, or the expression of dominant negative MAPK inhibits neuronal cell differentiation (8Fukuda M. Gotoh Y.

On the other hand, MAPK activity antagonizes the ability of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to differentiate. Treatment of these cells with a MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) enhances their differentiation, whereas overexpression of MAPK inhibits this process (10Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell.

Although the temporal pattern of MRF gene expression that controls the progress of muscle cell differentiation has been characterized, the signaling events that dictate whether myoblasts either proliferate or exit the cell cycle and express muscle-specific genes have not been fully described.

Both insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) utilize the MAPK pathway, in part, to promote C2C12 myoblast cell growth (19Milasincic D.J. Calera M.R. Farmer S.R. Pilch P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but still it is not clear what role p42/p44 MAPK plays in controlling the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. Thus the focus of this study is to examine the growth factor activated MAPK signaling cascade in the regulation of muscle cell differentiation. The differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts seems to be a default pathway for cells which are deprived of normal growth conditions (serum deprivation). In vivo, the differentiation process is tightly regulated by serum growth factors and by autocrine and paracrine factors. The C2C12 cell line is sensitive to bFGF, a growth factor known to regulate satellite cell function (20Allen R.E. Rankin L.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 194: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Husmann I. Soulet L. Gautron J. Martelly I. Barritault D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We show that bFGF is a more potent activator of p42/p44 MAPK compared with IGF-1 and this activation represses myogenesis. We use the specific inhibitor of MEK1 (PD98059) to show that p42/p44 MAPK activity is important for repression of muscle-specific gene expression and myoblast fusion. In addition, we determined that bFGF does not repress differentiation by maintaining the cells in a proliferative state even though it promotes one round of cell division and maintains the expression of cyclin D1. MAPK activity is critically important for the suppression of myogenesis during the 16–20 h after plating. At this time the cells are in late G1 phase and the early targets of MAPK appear to be expressed during this period. Mouse myoblast cells (C2C12) (22Yaffe D. Saxel O.

Cells were replated in DMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 0.4% calf serum for 1 h in the presence of the MEK1 specific inhibitor, PD98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or dimethyl sulfoxide carrier prior to addition of the indicated concentration of bFGF or IGF-1 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Approximately 2 × 106 cells were plated for analysis by Western blotting and 5 × 106 cells were plated for analysis by Northern blotting. Cells were supplemented every 24 h with bFGF, IGF-1, and PD98059 for the duration of the experiment. Phase-contrast images of the cells were taken 96 h after treatment using an Olympus IX70 Inverted Research Microscope in conjunction with a Kodak EOS DCS5A digital camera (Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT). Quiescent cells were plated into 24-well culture dishes at 3 × 105 cells per well.

Following fixation, cells were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min on ice and then samples were collected in 0.3 msodium hydroxide and counted using a scintillation counter. Myoblasts and myotubes were trypsinized and resuspended in ice-cold PBS. The cells were fixed by mixing with an equal volume of 100% ice-cold ethanol. Debris was removed by underlaying the fixed cells with calf serum followed by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed once with PBS and then treated with 50 μg/ml RNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) for 15 min at 37 °C. Propidium iodide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature before analyzing in a Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA).

Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in 10% nonfat milk in PBS-T (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) and then with the following primary antibodies in PBS-T and 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature; F5D monoclonal antiserum (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) specific for myogenin, MF20 monoclonal antiserum (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) specific for myosin heavy chain, anti-ACTIVE MAPK antibody (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), that recognizes only the activated p42/p44 MAPK species, pan-ERK antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), PC10 (PCNA) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), p27KIP1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), cyclin D1 antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) were diluted 1:2000 in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) with MD ImageQuant Software version 3.2. RNA was obtained as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed three times with PBS, lysed in Solution D (4m guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol), followed by acid phenol (pH 4.2):chloroform extraction. Total RNA was precipitated in isopropyl alcohol at −20 °C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × gat 4 °C for 20 min. Equal amounts (20 μg) of RNA were separated on a 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel and transferred to GeneScreen nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary action using 10 × SSC (1.5 m NaCl, 0.15 msodium citrate, pH 7.0) as the liquid phase. The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using the UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). RNA was checked for equal loading and transfer by UV visualization of ethidium bromide rRNA staining. Prehybridization of nylon membranes was for 4–6 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 4 × SSC, 5 × Denhardts (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mg/ml sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml tRNA carrier. Hybridization of the blot was for 16–20 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 4 × SSC, 1 × Denhardts, 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mg/ml sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml tRNA carrier, and the labeled probe. The cDNA inserts used for probes were MyoD (29Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar) and myogenin (30Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The cDNA probes were labeled with [32P]dATP by random priming using the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (31Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar) and purified with a NucTrap column (Stratagene). The specific activity of the probes were at least 108 cpm. Blots were washed in a stepwise gradient at moderate stringency (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C) and exposed to film at −80 °C. Cells were detached from the plate with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and then resuspended in PBS with 0.4% trypan blue. Viable cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion were counted using a hemocytometer. The amount of protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockfork, IL). Bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Various signal transduction pathways, such as the MAPK cascade, have been implicated in controlling proliferation, growth arrest, and differentiation. The data concerning the role of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in myogenesis is conflicting as both positive and negative regulatory roles have been suggested (32Sarbassov D.D. Jones L.G. Peterson C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 34Gredinger E.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1794-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The present study addresses the role of bFGF induced p42/p44 MAPK activation in C2C12 differentiation. A cell suspension method was used (24Dike L.E. Farmer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6792-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Milasincic D.J. Dhawan J. Farmer S.R. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1996; 32: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that permits growth arrest of C2C12 cells in Gowithout subsequent induction of the myogenic program. This technique allows us to characterize early signaling events induced by growth factors in a synchronous way and to determine the effect of this signaling on muscle cell differentiation. Quiescent C2C12 cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of bFGF or IGF-1 and MAPK phosphorylation was measured after 5 min by Western blotting with a MAPK antibody that recognizes the activated form of MAPK (Fig. 1). Activation of MAPK by bFGF or IGF-1 requires nanomolar concentrations of growth factor, with bFGF being a significantly more potent upstream activator of MAPK phosphorylation. Compared with IGF-1-treated cells, the addition of bFGF (0.1–1 nm) to quiescent cells results in MAPK phosphorylation that is ∼13-fold higher than the activation following IGF-1 treatment. Cells treated with the same growth factor concentrations were examined for myogenin expression by Western blot analysis. In control cells (no growth factor treatment) and in cells treated with nanomolar concentrations of IGF-1, myogenin is expressed at 48 h, while bFGF-treated cells express less than 4% the amount of myogenin observed in control or IGF-1-treated cells. One interesting point is that cells treated with 10 nm IGF-1 exhibit a slight decrease in myogenin expression due to the proliferative effects of IGF-1 at this concentration (36Layne M.D. Farmer S.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 2L. Tortorella and P. Pilch unpublished data. The results in Fig. 1 indicate a correlation between the level of bFGF induced MAPK activity and myogenin expression. The MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, was used to block MAPK activation in response to growth factor stimulation. Quiescent C2C12 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of PD98059 and then stimulated with bFGF or IGF-1. The dose dependence of the inhibitor on MAPK activity and myogenin protein expression is shown in Fig. 2. In agreement with the data presented in Fig. 1, IGF-1 and bFGF activate the p42 and p44 isoforms of MAPK, although to different extents. Cells treated with 3 nm IGF-1 and 20 μm PD98059 have no detectable MAPK activity, while cells treated with 1 nm bFGF and increasing concentrations of PD98059 still retain some of their kinase activity. Even at the highest concentration (100 μm) of PD98059 tested, the bFGF induced activation of MAPK is inhibited by ∼70%. Most likely, the inability of PD98059 to completely inhibit MAPK phosphorylation is due to the limited solubility of the inhibitor (19Milasincic D.J. Calera M.R. Farmer S.R. Pilch P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). Alternatively, since PD98059 is specific for MEK1, it may not block signaling that is MEK2 dependent. The addition of PD98059 to cells correlates with a loss of MAPK activity, but not to a loss of MAPK protein expression as determined by probing the blot with pan-ERK which recognizes the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of MAPK (data not shown). Myogenin protein expression was analyzed under these same conditions to determine whether the level of MAPK activity correlates with the amount of muscle-specific marker expression. C2C12 cells stimulated with IGF-1 express myogenin at 48 h after addition of growth factor, in a manner similar to cells deprived of serum (Fig. 2 compare control and IGF-1-treated cells). Similar results were observed with control and IGF-1-treated cells since C2C12 cells express endogenous IGFs as they differentiate (38Tollefsen S.E. Lajara R. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13810-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Tollefsen S.E. Sadow J.L. Rotwein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11330-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and the addition of 3 nm IGF-1 does not have dramatic effect on differentiation. Meanwhile, the addition of bFGF inhibits the expression of myogenin (Fig. 2). Interestingly, cells treated with PD98059 in addition to either IGF-1 or bFGF exhibit enhanced expression of myogenin protein 48 h after exposure to growth factor (Fig. 2, lanes labeled FGF+PD andIGF+PD). At the higher end of the concentration range for PD98059, a 4.5-fold increase in myogenin expression is observed for cells incubated with bFGF and PD98059, while a 1.5-fold increase occurs in cells treated with IGF-1 and PD98059, compared with their counterparts that saw growth factor alone. These data suggest that inactivation of MAPK relieves a repression of myogenin expression and that MAPK activity may play a role in suppressing differentiation in C2C12 cells. To determine whether the MAPK-dependent reduction of myogenin protein is a result of decreased mRNA expression, Northern blot analysis was performed. Total mRNA was isolated at the indicated time during the differentiation time course and the expression of myoD andmyogenin were examined (Fig.3 A). Up-regulation of bothmyoD and myogenin mRNA is observed in control (no growth factor stimulation) and IGF-1-treated cells by 24 h post-stimulation. Cells treated with the PD98059 inhibitor, in addition to IGF-1, undergo a more rapid induction of these mRNAs (Fig.3 A, compare IGF to IGF+PD at 24 h). Alternatively, C2C12 cells stimulated with bFGF exhibit minimal expression of myoD and myogenin. Cells treated with both bFGF and PD98059 express both myoD andmyogenin although to a lesser extent and in a delayed time course compared with control cells. Thus, MRF expression appears to be transcriptionally regulated by bFGF. To confirm that the lack of muscle-specific gene expression is reflective of changes in C2C12 phenotype, the expression of muscle-specific proteins and myoblast fusion was examined. Quiescent C2C12 cells were treated as in Fig. 3 A and then at the indicated times the cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting for myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myogenin (Fig. 3 B). The expression of muscle marker proteins is induced in control (no growth factor stimulation) and IGF-1-treated cells. Myogenin protein expression is evident 24–48 h after stimulation, along with subsequent induction of MHC protein by 48–72 h. On the other hand, cells treated with bFGF lack expression of myogenin and MHC, and fail to differentiate into myotubes (Fig.3 C). Cells treated with the MEK1 inhibitor exhibit enhanced expression of differentiation markers (Fig. 3 B, lanes labeled FGF+PD and IGF+PD). The combined treatment of IGF-1 and PD98059 results in an earlier induction of both myogenin and MHC proteins (Fig. 3 B, compare IGFto IGF+PD at 24 h). Moreover, the treatment of cells with bFGF and PD98059 also leads to fusion of cells into multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 3 C) and the induction of myogenin and MHC proteins (Fig. 3 B, compare FGF toFGF+PD). Cells treated with both bFGF and the inhibitor demonstrate a 6–8-fold increase in myogenin over cells treated with bFGF alone. The differentiation of bFGF-treated C2C12 cells cannot be completely restored by the addition of PD98059, perhaps because of the limited solubility of the inhibitor or because of its specificity for MEK1 as mentioned above. The inhibition of differentiation by MAPK activity may result from the ability of bFGF to maintain the cells in a proliferative state. The possibility that bFGF is causing the cells to proliferate throughout the “differentiation” time course was tested by assaying the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA as a marker of cell cycle progression (S phase). Quiescent cells treated with fetal bovine serum were used as an indicator of continuous cell cycling and the amount of radiolabeled thymidine detected in these cells st"

We have recently described a new RhoGAP (GTPase activatingprotein for RhoGTPases) gene, MgcRacGAP, primarily expressed in male germ cells, at the spermatocyte stage. We report here the isolation, through two-hybrid cloning, of a new partner of MgcRacGAP, very specifically expressed in the male germ line and showing structural features of anion transporters. This large protein (970 amino acids and a predicted size of 109 kDa), we provisionally designated Tat1 (for testis anion transporter 1), is closely related to a sulfate permease family comprising three proteins in human (DRA, Pendrin, and DTD); it is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with 14 transmembrane helices and intracytoplasmic NH2 and COOH termini. In situ hybridization studies demonstrate that Tat1 and MgcRacGAPgenes are coexpressed in male germ cells at the spermatocyte stage. On testis sections, Tat1 protein can be immunodetected in spermatocytes and spermatids associated with plasma membrane. Two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays demonstrate that MgcRacGAP stably interacts through its NH2-terminal domain with the Tat1 COOH-terminal region. Expression of Tat1 protein in COS7 cells generates a 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-disulfonic acid stilbene and chloride-sensitive sulfate transport. Therefore we conclude that Tat1 is a novel sulfate transporter specifically expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids and interacts with MgcRacGAP in these cells. These observations raise the possibility of a new regulatory pathway linking sulfate transport to Rho signaling in male germ cells.

GTPase activating protein glutathione S-transferase amino acid(s) fetal calf serum benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-disulfonic acid stilbene RhoGTPases, which include Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are signaling proteins of the Ras superfamily that have been highly evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Members of the Rho family were initially believed to be primarily involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and to control shape changes in response to extracellular growth factors. In recent years, they have been shown, in fibroblasts and other somatic cell types, to regulate a myriad of other cellular functions, including motility, adhesion, gene expression, cell cycle progression, and cell division (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Although many potential effectors and regulatory proteins of Rho GTPases have been described, signaling pathways controlling their pleiotropic functions are far from fully understood (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 3Aspenstrom P. Curr.

We have recently described a new RhoGAP (GTPaseactivating protein for RhoGTPases) gene we called Mgc(Male germ cell)RacGAP, as it is primarily expressed in male germ cells, at spermatocyte stage (5Touré A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jégou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).MgcRacGAP mRNA was also found in lower amount in many tissues in human and highly expressed in embryonic cerebral cortex in mouse (6Arar C. Ott M.O. Touré A. Gacon G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MgcRacGAP belongs to the chimaerin family of RhoGAPs,i.e. comprising a RhoGAP domain in the COOH-terminal half, and NH2-terminal to this domain, a zinc finger-like motif and a large NH2-terminal extension. We have recently described a mouse MgcRacGAP cDNA encoding an additional NH2-terminal sequence of 106 residues resulting in a ∼70-kDa protein (6Arar C. Ott M.O. Touré A. Gacon G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); a human MgcRacGAP cDNA showing a homologous 5′ extension has also been reported (7Kawashima T. Hirose K. Satoh T. Kaneko A. Ikeda Y. Kaziro Y. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. Blood. 2000; 96: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hirose K. Kawashima T. Iwamoto I. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Physiological functions of Chimaerins have been analyzed in details by microinjection of fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells with various forms ofn-chimaerin, a brain-specific Rac/Cdc42 GAP1 (9Ahmed S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Hall C. Lim H.H. Smith P. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whereas the GAP domain alone inhibited Rac-activated lamellipodia formation, strikingly, full-length n-chimaerin stimulated formation of the actin-based structures lamellipodia and filopodia. These n-chimaerin-stimulated events required the non-GAP NH2-terminal half of the protein and were also dependent on activated Rac and Cdc42(10Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that n-chimaerin mediates downstream signaling rather than down-regulation of Rac and Cdc42. Therefore, while the RhoGAP domain of MgcRacGAP exhibits GAP activity in vitro toward Rac and Cdc42 (5Touré A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jégou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we postulated that MgcRacGAP may also fulfil RhoGTPase effector functions through its non-GAP regions. A close homolog of MgcRacGAP is the Drosophila protein Rotund(Rn)RacGAP, the product of a spermatocyte-specific gene essential for male fertility, as its inactivation leads to male sterility in the fruit fly (11Agnel M. Roder L. Vola C. Griffin-Shea R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5111-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Guichard A. Bergeret E. Griffin-Shea R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 61: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data indicate that MgcRacGAP may operate in a Rho-dependent signaling pathway(s) involved in the development and/or function of male germ cells. To elucidate pathways implicating MgcRacGAP and approach their function, we have searched for partners of the MgcRacGAP NH2-terminal region, expressed in male germ cells. We report here the cloning and characterization of an MgcRacGAP interacting protein specifically expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids and showing structural and functional features of a sulfate transporter. cDNAs encoding various domains of MgcRacGAP and Tat1 proteins were subcloned in pGEX plasmids for GST fusion protein production, in the pLex plasmid pVJL10 (13Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) for two-hybrid assays, and in the expression plasmid pRK5 for transient transfection experiments. Lex-Mgc(N), Lex-Mgc(GAP), and Lex-MgcRacGAP correspond to LexA fused to aa 1–180, aa 238–513 of MgcRacGAP, and full-length (aa 1–528) MgcRacGAP, respectively (amino acid numbering refers to MgcRacGAP sequence initially described in Ref. 5Touré A.

GST-Tat1(Cter) corresponds to Tat1 (aa 664–970) fused to GST. pRK5-Tat1 and pRK5myctag-RacL61 express full-length Tat1 and myctagged-RacL61, respectively. Using Lex-Mgc(N) as a bait, we have screened a pACT2 human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH). Two hybrid procedures for isolation of specific clones that interact with MgcRacGAP were carried out according to published methods (13Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 14Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Full-length Tat1 cDNA was obtained by screening of λgt11 human testis cDNA libraries (CLONTECH). Clones of interest were sequenced using the Sanger dideoxy termination method adapted to an ABI 373A automated sequencer. Sequence analysis was performed using computer facilities provided by Infobiogen. BLAST programs were used to search for homologies in protein data banks, and the Transmembrane Protein secondary structure prediction program (TMpred) was used to elaborate a model of Tat1 topology across plasma membrane. We probed a multiple human tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) with a Tat1cDNA fragment; a β-actin probe was used as a control. A 1129-base pair fragment of Tat1 cDNA was subcloned in the Bluescript KS plasmid allowing both SP6 and T7 transcription;35S-UTP-labeled antisense or sense cRNA probes were obtained by linearizing the plasmid, respectively, byHindIII or BamHI and transcribing with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. In the same way, the MgcRacGAP cRNA antisense probe was generated by linearizing a pExLox plasmid containing a 1837-base pair cDNA fragment with KpnI and transcribing with SP6 polymerase as described previously (5Touré A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). 4-μm paraffin sections of human adult testis were hybridized overnight at 55 °C, washed as described previously (15Wilkinson D.G. Green J. Copp A.L. Cockroft D.L. Post-implantation Mammalian Embryos: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 55-72Google Scholar), and exposed to Ilford K5 emulsion for 4 or 5 days. After development of the emulsion, sections were counterstained with toluidine blue and analyzed. Sertoli cells were isolated from 20 days post-partum Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (16Toebosch A.M. Robertson D.M. Klaij I.A. de Jong F.H. Grootegoed J.A. J. Endocrinol. 1989; 122: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the second day of culture, the cells were exposed to a hypotonic treatment to eliminate the contaminating germ cells (17Galdieri M. Ziparo E. Palombi F. Russo M.A. Stefanini M. J. Androl. 1981; 5: 249-259Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The degree of purity of the isolated Sertoli cells was greater than 98%. The isolation of peritubular cells was carried out during Sertoli cell preparation as described previously (18Skinner M.K. Fritz I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The peritubular cells obtained were at least 99% pure. Spermatogonia were prepared from testes of 9 days post-partum male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Seminiferous epithelial cells were dispersed by enzyme treatment and separated by sedimentation at unit gravity as described previously (19Guillaume E.D.A Moertz E Courtens J.L Jégou B Pineau C Proteome. 2000. in press, 2001Google Scholar), leading to greater than 90% pure spermatogonia. Pachytene spermatocytes and early spermatids were prepared by centrifugal elutriation with a purity greater than 90% according to a method previously described (20Pineau C. Syed V. Bardin C.W. Jégou B. Cheng C.Y. J. Androl. 1993; 14: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that enzymatic dissociation of cells was replaced by a mechanical dispersion. Immediately after isolation, all cell fractions were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used. Antibodies to recombinant Tat1 COOH-terminal region (aa 664–970) were raised in rabbit and affinity-purified on a Tat1(aa 664–970)/Affi-Gel column. Testes of adult rats were carefully dissected out and immersed in Bouin's fixative solution for 24 h. Samples were then dehydrated through an increasing gradient of alcohol and acetone, before being embedded in paraffin wax. Testis sections (5 μm thick) were microwaved (2 × 3 min in phosphate-buffered saline) after mounting. Sections were then incubated with purified rabbit anti-Tat1 antibody, with a working dilution of 1:500. Preimmune serum was also used as a negative control. Complexes were revealed using a goat anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody (Dako, Glostrup, France) at a working dilution of 1:500, coupled with a streptavidin-peroxidase amplification combination. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. After color development, the samples were mounted with Glycergel (Dako, Glostrup, France) for microscopic observation. Transient transfections (24 or 48 h) of pRK5-Tat1 and pRK5-myctagged-racL61 expression vectors were performed in COS7 cells, using the fugene-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were loaded on a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Rabbit anti-Tat1-purified antibodies were used to detect Tat1 expression in transfected cells. For glycosylation inhibition experiments, transient transfection of HeLa cells was performed in a medium containing 10% FCS or 10% FCS supplemented with N- or O-glycosylation inhibitors: 25 ng/ml tunicamycin or 2 nm BADG (benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside), respectively. After 24 h, cells were lysed as above, and lysates were submitted to Western blot analysis. 1 μg of Bluescript plasmids containing either Tat1 full-length cDNA or luciferase cDNA were transcribed and translated in the presence of 20 μCi of [35S]methionine in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). GST-Mgc(N), GST-Mgc(GAP), and GST-MgcRacGAP fusion proteins (1–3 μg) were coupled to 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 2.5 μg of Tat1 COOH-terminal fragment (aa 664–970) during 1 h 30 min at 4 °C, in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100. Beads were sedimented and washed twice with cold washing buffer (25 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors), once with 1 m NaCl, and once more with cold washing buffer. “Bound proteins” were recovered by boiling beads in Laemmli sample buffer and were subjected to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Filters were incubated with rabbit anti-Tat1 antibodies followed by peroxidase-labeled swine anti-rabbit antibodies and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS7 cells were transiently transfected as described above with pRK5 empty vector (mock) or pRK5-expressing Tat1. Transport activity was assayed by measuring the efflux of sulfate (35SO4) as described (21Elgavish A. Meezan E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C176-C186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Satoh H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2695-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 37 °C in 12-well plates. Cells were loaded with the respective radiolabeled anions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for 30 min in a medium containing: 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For the sulfate experiment, the medium also contained [35S]Na2SO4 (40 μCi/ml) and 0.3 mm Na2SO4. For iodide efflux determination, cells were loaded with Na125I (1 μCi/ml) in the presence of 1 μm KI. After incubation, cells were rinsed three times with cold medium. Efflux was determined every 1 min for 11 min during which the medium was removed at 1-min intervals to be counted and quickly replaced by 1 ml of the same medium. For the inhibition assay, 1 mm DIDS (4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-disulfonic acid stilbene from Sigma) was added to the efflux buffer. For selectivity study, NaCl was substituted in the efflux buffer by sodium gluconate. At the end of the efflux, the medium was recovered, and cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 1n NaOH. All fractions were counted for radioactivity, and efflux curves were constructed by plotting the percentage of total radioactivity released in the medium versus time. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of n observations. To compare sets of data, we used either an analysis of variance or Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. All tests were performed using Prism 3.0 (Graphpad). In a search for partners of MgcRacGAP in male germ cells, we screened a two-hybrid library of human testis using as a bait a non-Rho-binding NH2-terminal region (aa 1–180) of human MgcRacGAP sequence (5Touré A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jégou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Among others, a 1.3-kilobase cDNA was isolated; probing human RNA blots with this fragment revealed a 3.4-kilobase mRNA exclusively expressed in testis (Fig.1). This 1.3-kilobase cDNA fragment was subsequently used as a probe to clone the full-length cDNA in human testis cDNA phage libraries. Analysis and sequencing of overlapping clones predicted an open reading frame of 2910 base pairs encoding a protein of 970 amino acids (109 kDa) of which only the COOH-terminal 300-aa fragment was present in the two-hybrid clone. Searching nucleic sequence data banks with this sequence allowed us to retrieve several human expressed sequence tag sequences showing a perfect match with our cDNA. Interestingly, all expressed sequence tag sequences found in data banks originate from testis, male germ cell tumors, or infant brain libraries, consistent with our finding that among adult human tissues expression of this gene is restricted to testis. Mouse and rat sequences encoding very similar proteins are also present in data banks, suggesting that orthologous genes exist in rodents. A human genomic fragment encompassing the whole cDNA sequence was also retrieved in the genomic section (High Throughput Genomic Sequence) of GenBankTM. Blast search in protein data banks revealed a clear similarity of the predicted protein with a family of anion (sulfate) permeases comprising three members in human,i.e. DRA (24Schweinfest C.W.

Multialignment programs (Fig.2) demonstrate the presence of conserved blocks among the three proteins and Tat1-specific extra sequences in amino acids 600–652 and COOH-terminal regions; these additional sequences account for the longer size ot Tat1 (970 aa) as compared with DRA (764 aa) and Pendrin (780 aa). Sequence analysis also predicted several N-glycosylation sites in Tat1 sequence; in particular, there are four putative N-glycosylation sites in the major predicted external loop (amino acids 570–751) (see Fig.3).Figure 2Tat1 protein sequence comparison.Alignment of the full-length proteins Tat1, DRA, and Pendrin.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar), the hydrophobicity plot of the Tat1 protein exhibited multiple potential transmembrane helices, and membrane topology prediction programs (TMpred) led to a preferred model with 14 strong transmembrane regions and NH2 and COOH termini inside the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). Since Tat1 gene appears exclusively expressed in testis on Northern blot (see Fig. 1), we looked for cell-specific expression in this organ. In situ hybridization of aTat1 cRNA probe to sections of human adult testis showed that Tat1 expression is (i) detected only in a few tubule sections and (ii) restricted to germ cells, as the grain density over somatic cells was not detectably above background (Fig.4 B). Moreover, Tat1transcript was found primarily, if not exclusively, in spermatocytes. This pattern is similar to that previously observed forMgcRacGAP except for a low level expression ofMgcRacGAP in round spermatids (5Touré A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jégou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); consistent with this finding, in situ hybridization of two serial sections withTat1 and MgcRacGAP cRNA probes showed coexpression of the two genes within the same tubules in the same groups of germinal cells at the spermatocyte stage (Fig. 4). However, while all Tat1-positive tubule sections were foundMgcRacGAP-positive as well, MgcRacGAP labeling was clearly detected in several Tat1-negative tubule sections, suggesting a shorter expression period for theTat1 gene. Using affinity-purified antibodies directed to the COOH-terminal region of Tat1 protein (aa 664–970), we did not detect Tat1-specific signals on Western blots of whole human or rat testis extracts; this could reflect the facts that (i) the amount of Tat1 protein present in expressing cells may be quite low, as frequently observed for membranous ion transporters, and (ii) membranous proteins are usually very difficult to solubilize from whole testis extracts. 2A. Touré, L. Morin, C. Pineau, and G. Gacon, unpublished observation. Western blot analysis on enriched populations of germ cells isolated from rat testis revealed multiple bands, ranging from 60 to 160 kDa and mainly expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids (Fig.5); preincubation of antibodies with pure recombinant Tat1-COOH-terminal fragment resulted in the disappearance of the 60–160 kDa bands, demonstrating that this pattern corresponds to Tat1-related proteins (not shown). The complexity of the pattern of Tat1-related polypeptides probably results from glycosylation and proteolysis as discussed below. Immunostaining of rat testis sections using the same antibody also revealed specific stage-dependent labeling in seminiferous tubules (Fig.6 A). In the tubules, a strong labeling was observed in germ cells from spermatocytes to elongated spermatids (Fig. 6 B). Immunoreactivity is clearly localized at the cell periphery of young spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes, and early and elongating spermatids, strongly suggesting a membranous expression of Tat1 (Fig. 6, A and B). A more diffuse cytoplasmic immunolabeling is still present in elongated spermatids at the very last steps of spermiogenesis (Fig.6 B). Altogether, data from Northern blot, in situhybridization, and immunodetection experiments clearly demonstrate that the Tat1 gene and Tat1 protein are exclusively expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids.Figure 6Immunodetection of Tat1 protein in adult rat testis. Immunolocalization of Tat1 on rat testis sections was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody to the Tat1-COOH-terminal region as a primary antibody, followed by a goat anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody and a streptavidin-peroxidase complex amplification combination. Sections were counterstained with Masson hematoxylin. Roman numerals indicate the stages of the seminiferous epithelium. A, stage-dependent expression of Tat1 protein. A specific stage-dependent labeling is distributed within the seminiferous epithelium.B, membranous localization of Tat1 protein. Tat1 immunoreactivity is detected at stage VII of the seminiferous epithelium in pachytene spermatocytes (open arrows) and early spermatids (arrows) at the periphery of the cytoplasm, suggesting a membranous localization. Elongated spermatids also display a positive but more diffuse cytoplasmic staining (arrowheads). C, preimmune control. The specificity of the immunoreaction was ascertained by a parallel experiment in which preimmune serum was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize Tat1 protein, we expressed Tat1cDNA in cultured cells. Transfection of Tat1 constructs in COS7 (or HeLa cells) resulted in a high level of protein expression as evidenced by the strong specific immunofluorescence labeling of transfected cells (not shown). Immunoblots of lysates from COS7 cells overexpressing Tat1 protein show a heavily labeled diffuse band with a high molecular mass (>200 kDa) and a series of minor bands ranging from 110 to 50 kDa molecular mass (Fig.7 A). These bands are completely absent in a lysate from COS7 cells transfected with an irrelevant expression plasmid (pRK5-racL61) and thus must correspond to specific Tat1 expression. This pattern is reminiscent of the one reported for the intestine-specific anion transporter DRA (29Byeon M.K. Westerman M.A. Maroulakou I.G. Henderson K.W. Suster S. Zhang X.K. Papas T.S. Vesely J. Willingham M.C. Green J.E. Schweinfest C.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar, 30Byeon M.K. Frankel A. Papas T.S. Henderson K.W. Schweinfest C.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and suggests that the major slow migrating form of Tat1 could result from glycosylation of the protein, as usually found in integral membrane proteins. The 110-kDa band fits with the expected size of the protein as deduced from open reading frame translation (109 kDa) and might represent a minor fraction of non post-translationnally modified protein. The exact nature of the additional multiple sized proteins detected in COS7 lysates is not known; as mentioned previously for DRA, this complexity could result from a combination of NH2-terminal truncation and glycosylation (30Byeon M.K. Frankel A. Papas T.S. Henderson K.W. Schweinfest C.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription/translation experiments using Tat1 cDNA as a template also resulted in a complex pattern of protein synthesized (Fig. 7B); this includes high molecular mass possibly glycosylated forms, 110-kDa and shorter bands, which could correspond to the use of multiple initiation sites. Treatment of Tat1-expressing HeLa cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, resulted in the complete disappearance of the diffuse high molecular mass species (Fig.7 C); by contrast, O-glycosylation inhibitor BADG had no effects. This result clearly demonstrates that the bulk of Tat1 protein present in those cells is N-glycosylated. Altogether our data strongly suggest that within the different systems analyzed (HeLa human cells, COS7 simian cells, rat germ cells, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate) Tat1 protein is synthesized as a high molecular mass species corresponding to various degrees of glycosylation; this probably reflects species and/or tissue specificity of glycosyltransferase (31Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and glycosidase (32Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) involved inN-glycan biosynthesis. Tat1/MgcRacGAP interaction was analyzed in two-hybrid experiments andin vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins and anti-Tat1C-ter antibodies. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, Tat1 COOH-terminal region strongly interacts with the Mgc-N region (aa 1–180) but not with the GAP domain (Fig.8 A). In vitro, GST-Mgc-N fusion protein actually binds to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Tat1. The Tat1 COOH-terminal region also interacts with the full-length MgcRacGAP protein, but not with the GAP domain (Fig.8 B, lanes 2–4). Taken together, these results demonstrate that MgcRacGAP interacts through its NH2-terminal region with the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of Tat1. In a first approach to Tat1 function, COS7 cells expressing Tat1 were assayed for anion transport. As shown in Fig.9 A, sulfate efflux was markedly enhanced in Tat1-expressing cells as compared with mock transfected cells. When extracellular chloride was replaced by gluconate, the Tat1-mediated sulfate transport was markedly reduced showing a dependence upon extracellular Cl− (Fig.9 B). In addition, Tat1-mediated sulfate efflux was inhibited by the anion exchanger inhibitor DIDS as illustrated in Fig.9 C. By contrast, the iodide transport (Fig. 9 D) was not modified by Tat1 expression. Together, these data support the idea that Tat1 is a bona fide anion transporter displaying sulfate transport at least partly through a sulfate/chloride exchange mechanism (21Elgavish A. Meezan E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C176-C186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Satoh H. Susaki M. Shukunami C. Iyama K. Negoro T. Hiraki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12307-12315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier (see Figs. 2 and 3), the Tat1 COOH-terminal region has no counterpart in DRA, Pendrin, and DTD and is predicted to be located in cytoplasm; this suggests that MgcRacGAP binding to the Tat1 COOH-terminal region could provide a specific regulatory mechanism of Tat1 transport function and that Rho GTPases might participate in the regulation of sulfate transport in male germ cells. Although we have no clue as to the role of sulfate transport in male germ cells, two lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the MgcRacGAP/Tat1 pathway could fulfil important functions. 1) Recently, the orthologous gene of MgcRacGAP in Caenorhabditis elegans, CYK-4, and human MgcRacGAP have been shown to play an essential role in the process of cell division (8Hirose K. Kawashima T. Iwamoto I. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 33Jantsch-Plunger V. Gonczy P. Romano A. Schnabel H. Hamill D. Schnabel R. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). More specifically, those proteins have been shown to associate with mitotic spindle and to be required for cytokinesis. Interestingly, throughout spermatogenesis, both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions are characterized by incomplete cytokinesis resulting in the persistence of intercytoplasmic bridges (34Weber J.E. Russell L.D. Am. J. Anat. 1987; 180: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). While incomplete cytokinesis during mitotic divisions may be related to the absence of MgcRacGAP in spermatogonia (5Touré A. Dorseuil O. Morin L. Timmons P. Jégou B. Reibel L. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6019-6023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar),2 we speculate that, in spermatocytes, where MgcRacGAP and Tat1 are coexpressed, Tat1/MgcRacGAP interaction may interfere with MgcRacGAP function and eventually preclude complete cytokinesis during meiotic divisions. 2)Tat1 belongs to a family of anion transporters comprising three human proteins, i.e. DRA, DTD, and Pendrin. Strikingly, mutations in all three corresponding genes Dra, DTD, andPDS are responsible for human diseases, i.e.congenital chloride diarrhea (28Moseley R.H. Hoglund P. Wu G.D. Silberg D.G.

This implies that each of these genes plays a specific and essential role in affected tissues. In agreement with this view, Dra and PDS show very specific expression in intestine epithelium and thyroid, respectively. AsTat1 gene expression appears restricted to the male germ line at the spermatocyte stage, we speculate that Tat1 may fulfil critical functions in these cells and that mutations in theTat1 gene may result in impaired spermatogenesis in human.

In cardiac and skeletal myocytes, YY1 has been described essentially as a negative regulator of muscle-specific genes. In this study, we report that YY1 is a transcriptional activator of the B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene, which encodes one of the heart major secretory products. YY1 binds an element within the proximal cardiac BNP promoter, in close proximity to the high affinity binding sites for the zinc finger GATA proteins. We show that YY1 cooperates with GATA-4 to synergistically activate BNP transcription. Structure-function analysis revealed that the DNA binding domain of YY1 is sufficient for cooperative interaction with GATA-4, likely through corecruitment of the CREB-binding protein coactivator. The results suggest that YY1 and GATA factors are components of transcriptionally active complexes present in cardiac and other GATA-containing cells.

Deletion analysis established three regulatory regions within this proximal promoter that are required for maximal transcriptional activity. Further analysis of one of these elements, which contains a binding site for the GATA family of zinc finger proteins, led to the isolation and characterization of transcription factor GATA-4 (1Grépin C.

A cardiac-restricted member of the GATA family of proteins, GATA-4, was since shown to be a key regulator of several cardiac genes (reviewed in Ref. 2Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev.

A 5′ deletion that removed the GATA motifs resulted in a 3- to 4-fold decrease in promoter activity; additionally, removal of a 20-bp element (−80 to −60 bp), which contains putative binding sites for YY1 and CACC box-binding proteins, led to a further 3-fold loss of BNP promoter activity in cardiomyocytes (1Grépin C.

We therefore undertook to examine the potential role of the YY1 protein in the regulation of BNP transcription. YY1 is a 65-kDa multifunctional zinc finger DNA binding transcription factor, belonging to the human GLI-Krüppel family of nuclear proteins (6Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T.

In addition to its role as a repressor, YY1 was shown to act as an activator of some promoters like the c-Myc (9Riggs K.J. Saleque S. Wong K.K. Merrell K.T. Lee J.S. Shi Y. Calame K. Mol. Cell.

YY1 binding sites have been identified within the regulatory regions of several cardiac and skeletal muscle genes, including muscle creatine kinase (22Vincent C.K. Gualberto A. Patel C.V. Walsh K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 1264-1272Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), α-skeletal actin, and cardiac actin (10Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that deletion of YY1 sites within these promoters results in a small, albeit reproducible gain in promoter activity, together with studies showing that YY1 competed with the action of serum response factor led to the suggestion that YY1 behaves as a repressor of cardiac genes (22Vincent C.K. Gualberto A. Patel C.V. Walsh K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 1264-1272Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Walowitz J.L. Bradley M.E. Chen S. Lee T. J. Biol.

The mechanisms by which YY1 mediates its pleiotropic responses remain undefined although it is clear that the promoter context and the cellular environment, including coactivators and corepressors, influence YY1 action. The cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP) belongs to a class of transcriptional cofactors that link upstream transactivators and the basal transcription machinery (26Eckner R. Ewen M.E.

In skeletal muscle, the CBP/p300 proteins act as transcriptional adaptors for MyoD and MEF-2 in the regulation of myogenesis (27Puri P.L. Avantaggiati M.L. Balsano C. Sang N. Graessmann A.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In the heart, CBP/p300 plays an important role in maintaining the terminally differentiated state of cardiomyocytes by both preventing reinitiation of DNA synthesis and activating subsets of cardiac-specific genes (32Hasegawa K. Meyers M.B. Kitsis R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20049-20054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the exact transcription factors with which CBP/p300 interact to regulate cardiac gene expression remain unclear, activity of the GATA proteins is likely to be modulated by these coactivators given that CBP cooperates with GATA-1 (33Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and p300 was recently shown to act as a coactivator for GATA-5 in the regulation of the cardiac atrial natriuretic factor gene (34Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that YY1 functions as a transcriptional activator of the cardiac BNP promoter and we provide evidence that YY1 cooperates with GATA-4 to enhance BNP transcription. This synergy requires GATA but not YY1 DNA binding sites and is mediated via CBP that likely serves as a bridge between the two factors allowing the formation of a transcriptionally competent complex. These findings suggest that cardiac-specific genes are controlled by complex transcriptional pathways involving combinatorial interactions between cell-restricted (GATA-4) and ubiquitous factors (YY1 and CBP); such multicomponent complexes likely provide additional levels of gene expression control. Rat BNP luciferase constructs were obtained by cloning appropriate promoter fragments generated using restriction enzymes or PCR into PXP2, as previously described (1Grépin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the proximal BNP promoter region were generated by PCR, and constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The expression vectors for the intact and mutated YY1 were generous gifts of Dr. Kenneth Walsh and Dr. Robert Schwartz and have been previously described (10Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gualberto A. Lepage D. Pons G. Mader S.L. Park K. Atchison M.L. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The GATA expression vectors used have been described previously (35Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 36Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The expression vector for the human CBP was a gift from Dr. Robert Rehfuss (McGill University, Montréal, CA). HeLa or CV1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary cardiocyte cultures were prepared from 1–4-day Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and kept in synthetic medium as previously described (37McBride K. Robitaille L. Tremblay S. Argentin S. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 24 h after plating, cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate technique. Rous sarcoma virus-human growth hormone was included (2 μg per dish) to normalize for transfection efficiencies. The total amount of DNA was kept constant (maximum 10 μg per 35-mm dish) by the addition of PCB6+ or pBluescript DNA. Cells were harvested, and the medium was collected 36 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech luminometer, and the human growth hormone was measured in the cell media by radioimmunoassay as previously described (38Argentin S. Sun Y.-L. Lihrmann I. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Nemer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23315-23322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results reported were obtained from at least four independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate using two different DNA preparations. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells according to Schreiber et al. (39Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Extracts from HeLa cells overexpressing YY1 were prepared from 200,000 cells transfected with 10 μg of expression vectors. The probe for YY1 binding, GGTCTCCATTTTGAAGCG, corresponds to the adeno-associated virus P5 +1 site and has been previously described (6Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The probes used from the BNP promoter correspond to sequences from −84 to −60 bp as follows: wild type, TCAGAGATCTCCCCACCCCTACTCCATGAGAAGG; YY1m, TCAGAGATCTCCCCACCCCTACTCTATGAGAAGG; CACCm, TCAGAGATCTCCTTAGGCCTACTCCATGAGAAGG. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 3–5 μg of nuclear extracts, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg poly dI-dC oligonucleotides, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added as competitors at 100-fold molar excess when required. Binding reactions were analyzed on a 5% (30:1) polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 10 volts/cm for 3 h at room temperature. As a control, an oligonucleotide containing an octomer motif was used to detect OCT-1 binding in the nuclear extracts as described previously (4Grépin C. Robitaille L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The antibody directed against human SP1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and that for human YY1 was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Schwartz (Baylor College of Medicine). Supershift assays were performed to identify antibody-protein interactions. A reaction mixture containing the binding buffer, nuclear extracts, and dI-dC was first incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the relevant antibody. The labeled probe was then added, and binding was carried out for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing gel as described above. Deletion analysis of the proximal rat BNP promoter indicated that sequences between −80 and −60 bp contribute significantly to BNP promoter activity. Their deletion decreases promoter activity by 3- to 4-fold in atrial primary cardiocyte cultures (Fig.1 A). The −80- to −60-bp region harbors two potential transcription factor binding sites, a CCACC box, which can interact with two classes of zinc finger proteins, SP1, and members of the EKLF-Krüppel family (40Yu C.Y. Motamed K. Chen J. Bailey A.D. Shen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8907-8915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 42Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and adjacent to it, a CCAT core, which is a putative binding site for the YY1 zinc finger protein (43Hyde-DeRuyscher R.P. Jennings E. Shenk T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 44Yant S.R. Zhu W. Millinoff D. Slightom J.L. Goodman M. Gumucio D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4353-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Gel shift analysis showed that both SP1 and YY1 interact with the BNP sequences (Fig.2) as evidenced by competition analysis and antibody recognition. Incubation of a 20-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to the −80- to −60-bp region with HeLa cell nuclear extracts resulted in the formation of three major sequence-specific DNA binding complexes (Fig. 2 A). The complex with the slowest mobility was identified as an SP1-like protein based on competition with an unlabeled high affinity SP1 site and its interaction with the SP1 antibody (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The two faster migrating complexes were identified as YY1; both complexes are specifically competed with a consensus YY1 site from the adenovirus-associated P5 promoter and blocked by a YY1 antibody (Fig. 2 B). In addition, they show similar mobility as complexes obtained on the well studied adenovirus YY1 binding site (Fig. 2 C). Binding of SP1 and YY1 to their cognate juxtaposed sites occurs independently, because mutation of the YY1 site (YY1m) does not affect SP1 binding. Similarly, mutation of the SP1 site, which abrogates SP1 binding, does not qualitatively or quantitatively alter the YY1 complexes (Fig.2 A). YY1 is expressed in cardiomyocytes (22Vincent C.K. Gualberto A. Patel C.V. Walsh K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 1264-1272Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 777-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown to negatively regulate several cardiac promoters including α-skeletal actin (10Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar, 24MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cardiac actin (23Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 812-822PubMed Google Scholar), and muscle creatine kinase (22Vincent C.K. Gualberto A. Patel C.V. Walsh K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 1264-1272Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). SP1 levels are very low in postnatal cardiomyocytes but appear to increase following trophic growth stimulation (46Ardati A. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When gel shift analyses were carried out using cardiomyocyte nuclear extracts, the predominant complex observed over the BNP probe corresponded to YY1 (Fig. 2 D). Moreover, the majority of YY1 binding in cardiomyocytes corresponded to the faster migrating YY1 complex observed in HeLa cells. Based on YY1 antibody recognition and gel migration properties, this complex likely represents an alternatively spliced YY1 form containing essentially the DNA binding zinc finger region.Figure 2Identification of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that interact with the proximal BNP element. A, three different radiolabeled 20-bp oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence between −80 and −60 bp (WT BNP) and others that contain mutations within the putative YY1 site or the CACC site were incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence-specific binding species obtained were competed with a 100-fold molar excess of cold competitor oligonucleotide that corresponds to a consensus YY1 site found in the adenovirus associated P+5 (adeno-YY1) promoter. B, supershift analysis using anti-YY1 or anti-SP1 on the wild type BNP probe revealed that the complex with the slowest mobility contained an SP1-like species. The two complexes with faster mobility correspond to YY1 as they are completely abrogated in the presence of YY1 antibody. C, the oligonucleotide containing the adenovirus consensus YY1 site was used as probe. Incubation with HeLa nuclear extracts revealed the presence of two sequence-specific complexes that were similar in mobility to those obtained on the BNP wild type probe and correspond to YY1 as confirmed by incubation with the YY1 antibody. Note that the SP1 antibody had no effect on YY1 binding. D, predominance of the fastest mobility YY1 complex in cardiac extracts prepared from neonate ventricular cardiomyocyte cultures. A similar pattern is observed in neonate atrial cardiomyocytes and in adult heart extracts. Also note the absence of SP1 binding in cardiac extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The functional consequences of YY1 binding to the BNP promoter were tested. Transient cotransfection analysis revealed that full-length YY1 is a potent transactivator of the BNP promoter (Fig.3). Other related zinc fingers such as Egr-1 and the KRAB domain containing protein ZNF74 (47Grondin B. Cote F. Bazinet M. Vincent M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27877-27885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) had no effect on BNP promoter activity (data not shown). YY1 transactivation of the BNP promoter required the proximal YY1 binding site, because 5′ or internal deletions, as well as a point mutant that removes the YY1 site, significantly reduced transactivation (Fig. 3). Other potential YY1 binding sites are present further upstream (−209, −220, −374, and −636), which might explain why the −2.2-kilobase pair BNP construct is maximally induced by YY1. To delineate the regions of YY1 required for transactivation, the effects of several deletion mutants of YY1 on the BNP promoter were assayed (Fig. 4 A). The results indicate that an intact zinc finger DNA binding is essential but not sufficient for maximal transactivation (Fig. 4 B, DM4 and DBD mutants, respectively). Surprisingly, deletions of the putative N-terminal activation domains of YY1 did not completely abolish transactivation as these mutants retained the ability to consistently induce a 2-fold increase in promoter activity. These observations are consistent with studies indicating that, although the N-terminal region contains an autonomous activation domain (amino acids 70–143) (48Seelan R.S. Grossman L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10175-10181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it is often dispensable for activation by YY1. For example, activation of the c-Myc promoter by YY1 is not affected by deletion of amino acids 89–220 (DM3) (10Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of a heterologous promoter construct containing the YY1 initiator element of the adeno-associated P5 promoter was maximal when amino acids 154–199 or 69–85 were deleted (49Bushmeyer S. Park K. Atchison M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30213-30220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that a YY1 protein containing essentially the zinc finger region, as found in cardiomyocytes, can activate target promoters possibly through recruitment or interaction with coactivators. The BNP promoter is a target for both GATA-4 and YY1, and the YY1 site at −70 is flanked by functional GATA elements centered at −90 and −30 (1Grépin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We tested whether the two factors functionally cooperate. Cotransfection of YY1 with limiting amounts of GATA-4 resulted in synergistic activation of the BNP promoter. Activation with both YY1 and GATA-4 (10- to 15-fold) was systematically greater than the additive effect of each factor alone (6- to 7-fold), suggesting that the two proteins cooperate over the BNP promoter (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, YY1 could also cooperate with other members of the GATA family including the hemopoietic GATA-1 and -3 and the cardiac GATA-6 proteins suggesting that GATA-YY1 interaction may be relevant to many cells (Fig.5 A). Removal of the upstream GATA elements (BNP −80) abolished the YY1/GATA-4 synergy. (Fig. 5 A). Activation by either factor was retained because of the presence of the −60 YY1 site and the −30 GATA site, but the addition of both YY1 and GATA-4 gave at best an additive effect. These results indicate that the −80 GATA-containing enhancer is essential for synergy with YY1 and suggest that binding of GATA-4 (or -6) to the more proximal GATA element (which is a specialized TATA box) cannot support YY1 cooperation. Next, we tested whether YY1 binding was required for synergy. For this, we generated the YY1 mutant in the context of the BNP −114 promoter. As shown in Fig. 5 B, this construct was no longer activated by YY1 but retained GATA-4 inducibility. Remarkably, the YY1 mutation did not alter the ability of YY1 to cooperate with GATA-4 and activate the BNP promoter to nearly maximal levels (Fig. 5 B). Thus the binding of GATA-4 to DNA appears to be sufficient to recruit YY1 into a transcriptionally productive complex. Next, we tested whether a truncated YY1 protein can functionally synergize with GATA-4, and we performed a structure-function analysis to determine the GATA-4 domains required for YY1 interaction. Wild type and mutant GATA-4 were epitope-tagged, which allowed assessment of the amount of protein produced using Western blot analysis (Fig.6 A). These were tested on full-length YY1 and on the shorter YY1 form consisting of the DNA binding domain; both YY1 proteins were produced at similar levels as confirmed by gel shift analysis (Fig. 6 B). Either one of the N or C terminus transactivation domains is sufficient for GATA-4 activation of BNP (Fig. 6 C). However, deletion of the C terminus domain totally abrogated synergy with YY1 whereas removal of the N-terminal domain slightly but consistently enhanced the synergy with YY1 (Fig. 6 C). Consistent with this, the DNA binding domain of GATA-4 was not sufficient for YY1 synergy. In contrast, the YY1 DNA binding domain is sufficient for maximal synergy with GATA-4, and the YY1 N terminus is dispensable in the presence of GATA-4 (Fig.6 D). Thus, in presence of GATA-4, the endogenous cardiac YY1 protein would be a potent transcriptional activator. To determine whether the synergy between GATA-4 and YY1 reflects physical interaction between the two proteins, we performed a series of coimmunoprecipitation experiments using in vitro-translated YY1 and GATA-4 proteins. No detectable interaction between GATA-4 and YY1 could be observed, although in the same experiments, we were able to detect other documented interactions (2Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) including that between GATA-4 and GATA-6 proteins (data not shown). These results suggest that either the interaction between the two proteins was not stable under these conditions or that it was mediated via a third protein. Both YY1 and members of the GATA family interact with several other nuclear proteins (35Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 50Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M.

Dermatol. 1993; 100 (suppl.): 196-203Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (74) Google Scholar) including some coactivators (33Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For example, it was recently demonstrated that the coactivator protein CBP/p300, which had been shown to associate with YY1 (54Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), also interacts with GATA-5 to regulate transcription of the atrial nutriuretic peptide gene (34Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether CBP was a potential mediator of synergy between YY1 and GATA-4. As shown in Fig. 7, CBP significantly enhanced GATA/YY1 activation of the BNP promoter (15-fold compared with 6-fold without CBP). CBP alone or in combination with either GATA-4 or YY1 had no significant effect on promoter activity supporting the hypothesis that its role was to mediate the formation of a transcriptionally competent complex between YY1 and GATA-4. In this study we demonstrate the role of YY1 as an important regulator of BNP transcription and provide evidence for the existence of a novel transcriptional pathway involving the combinatorial action of YY1, GATA-4, and CBP. YY1 is a complex transcription factor that is conserved across species. In the heart, YY1 has been previously characterized as a repressor of cardiac gene expression (22Vincent C.K. Gualberto A. Patel C.V. Walsh K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 1264-1272Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that YY1 is a potent transactivator of the BNP promoter and suggest that YY1 may be a positive regulator of BNP and other cardiac genes. Despite considerable efforts, we were unable to demonstrate a direct interaction between YY1 and GATA-4, and we suggest that this interaction is mediated via the CBP/p300 class of proteins. Alone CBP has no effect on BNP transcription suggesting that it acts as a mediator that bridges the two factors. The CBP/p300 proteins contain intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (55Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar) and can modify both the interactions of GATA-4 or YY1 with DNA or the chromatin structure itself to facilitate the formation of a transcriptionally competent complex over the BNP promoter. CBP has been previously demonstrated to regulate the activity of GATA-1 by acetylation (28Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). We have mapped distinct regions of YY1 required for GATA-4 synergy or activation. The N-terminal domain of YY1 is required for maximal DNA-dependent BNP activation; however, synergy with GATA-4 renders this domain dispensable, and the zinc finger region of YY1 is sufficient to mediate functional interaction with GATA-4. This finding may be very relevant to understanding the mechanisms of YY1 in gene regulation especially, because the major YY1 isoform present in cardiomyocytes appears to correspond to a truncated form consisting essentially of the DNA binding domain. The presence of multiple YY1 isoforms is consistent with published reports showing the presence of several YY1 mRNA isoforms in different cells and tissues including the heart (6Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.-S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 8Seto E. Shi Y. Shenk T. Nature. 1991; 354: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) 2Unpublished data. and YY1 complexes of varying mobility in nuclear extracts from different cells (56Korhonen P. Huotari V. Soininen H. Salminen A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because YY1 binding is required for basal activation but not for GATA-4 synergy, we speculate that YY1 could have a dual role in BNP regulation depending on the cellular context. In the presence of high levels of GATA-4 and CBP, recruitment to a GATA-containing complex via CBP may be the mechanism of action of YY1. In such a complex, YY1 could act as an architectural factor that functions to enhance protein-protein interactions between upstream factors and the basal transcriptional machinery as has been previously demonstrated on the c-fospromoter (57Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that the distal and not the −30-bp GATA element supports synergy. In addition to adequate protein levels, GATA/YY1/CBP cooperation may also necessitate post-translational modifications of one or more component of the complex. In the absence of complex assembly, YY1 may still activate the BNP promoter through sequence-specific binding to its site and via its own activation domains. Productive interaction among GATA factors, YY1, and CBP may be only observed under stimulated conditions such as stress or growth response or in a cell-specific manner, e.g. in cardiac but not brain cells, both of which express the BNP gene. Finally, it is noteworthy that both GATA-4 and YY1 have been linked to growth responses. The role of YY1 in cell growth was confirmed by inactivation of the YY1 gene in mice (7Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) as discussed earlier. Furthermore, YY1 has been implicated in mediating interleukin-1β-induced hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes (58Patten M. Hartogensis W.E. Long C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21134-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently, YY1 has also been implicated in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced transcription (59Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar); whether in cardiomyocytes YY1 is involved with GATA-4 in mediating transcriptional regulation in response to stress or growth stimulation deserves to be investigated. On the other hand, GATA-4 has been implicated in the activation of several genes during hypertrophy, including the angiotensin II type 1a receptor and the α-myosin heavy chain genes in response to pressure overload hypertrophy in rats (32Hasegawa K.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 3833-3835PubMed Google Scholar). The role of GATA-4 in the hypertrophic response may reside, in part, in GATA-4 association with other factors including NFAT-3 (62Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J.

Human nerve growth factor β (NGF) contains three disulfide bonds between nonconsecutive cysteine residues and forms insoluble aggregates when expressed in E. coli. We now report that overexpression of Dsb proteins known to catalyze formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds can substantially enhance periplasmic production of NGF. A set of pACYC184-based plasmids that permitdsb expression under the araB promoter were introduced into cells carrying a compatible plasmid that expresses NGF. The efficiency of periplasmic production of NGF fused to the OmpT signal peptide was strikingly improved by coexpression of DsbCD or DsbABCD proteins (up to 80% of total NGF produced). Coexpression of DsbAB was hardly effective, whereas that of DsbAC increased the total yield but not the periplasmic expression. These results suggest synergistic roles of DsbC and DsbD in disulfide isomerization that appear to become limiting upon NGF production. Furthermore, recombinant NGF produced with excess DsbCD (or DsbABCD) was biologically active judged by the neurite outgrowth assay using rat PC12 cells.

The periplasm of Escherichia coli contains enzymes that can assist protein folding such as Dsb (disulfide bond formation) proteins (1Wulfing C. Pluckthun A. J. Mol.

Such proteins can be secreted to the E. coli periplasm as in frame fusion proteins with a bacterial signal peptide (8Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol.

Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 512-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is often difficult, however, to obtain good yields of proteins by periplasmic production for a number of reasons (4Georgiou G. Valax P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 9Hockney R.C. Trends.

By promoting protein translocation (through the inner membrane) with altered translocation machinery (11Perez-Perez J. Marquez G. Barbero J.L. Gutierrez J. Biotechnology. 1994; 12: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Perez-Perez J. Barbero J.L. Marquez G. Gutierrez J. J. Biotechnol. 1996; 49: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or with coexpression of secretion-promoting factors such as molecular chaperones (e.g. SecB) (4Georgiou G. Valax P. Curr. Opin.

Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 512-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), appreciable improvements were made for some proteins that contain relatively simple patterns of disulfide bonds. However, eukaryotic secretion proteins often exhibit multiple and complex patterns of disulfide bonds (7Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4231-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and such structural features have been thought to create difficulties in obtaining active proteins, because incorrect disulfide bond formation is likely to yield inactive and insoluble products (13Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28487-28493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed several novel enzymes and factors involved in disulfide bond formation in the E. coli periplasm, which include at least four proteins, DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, and DsbD (4Georgiou G. Valax P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 5Missiakas D. Raina S. J.

A. 1998; 95: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These Dsb proteins contain one or more highly conserved thioredoxin-like Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys motifs that are crucial for the activity of disulfide oxidoreductases (5Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 18Chivers P.T. Laboissiere M.C. Raines R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2659-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). DsbA is a periplasmic enzyme that can act on nascent polypeptide chains in the formation of disulfide bonds during their folding (16Sone M. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10349-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Alksne L.E. Rasmussen B.A. J.

DsbC is another periplasmic enzyme known as a disulfide isomerase and can convert aberrant disulfide bonds to correct ones (16Sone M. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10349-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). DsbB and DsbD are associated with the inner membrane and modulate activities of DsbA and DsbC, respectively (14Missiakas D. Schwager F. Raina S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, an efficient chain of reactions for disulfide bond formation and isomerization seems to be operated in the periplasm during normal growth. Based on the above findings, overexpression of Dsb proteins has been employed to increase efficiency of periplasmic expression of a number of heterologous proteins with multiple disulfide bonds in E. coli (4Georgiou G. Valax P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 9Hockney R.C. Trends. Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 456-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10Makrides S.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 512-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, only limited success was reported; periplasmic expression of some proteins was improved by coexpression of DsbA, together with addition of reduced glutathione orN-acetylcysteine to the medium (26Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24547-24550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DsbC can become overloaded upon production of heterologous proteins with multiple disulfide bonds, leading to insufficient conversion of aberrant disulfide bonds to the correct forms (4Georgiou G. Valax P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4231-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Ostermeier M. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21072-21077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A dsbCdeletion reduced the production of urokinase (15Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) or insulin-like growth hormone I (28Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that has disulfide bonds formed between nonconsecutive cysteine residues but hardly affected production of alkaline phosphatase or OmpA (15Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) or human growth hormone that has disulfide bonds between consecutive cysteine residues (28Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results indicated potentially important roles of DsbC in folding of proteins carrying multiple disulfide bonds, especially those involving nonconsecutive cysteine pairs. It should be noted that DsbC exhibits a disulfide reductase activity (the active site cysteine residues must be kept reduced to attack incorrectly formed disulfide bonds and catalyze isomerization (14Missiakas D.

Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28487-28493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The redox potential of the active site of DsbC is controlled by DsbD (14Missiakas D. Schwager F.

Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol.

In this study, we systematically examined the effects of ìcontrolled coexpression of sets of Dsb proteins on periplasmic production of human nerve growth factor β (NGF).1 NGF carries three disulfide bonds with nonconsecutive cysteine pairs and was previously shown to aggregate upon periplasmic expression in E. coli(30Fujimori K. Fukuzono S. Kotomura N. Kuno N. Shimizu N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 1985-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The set of newly constructed plasmids provided convenient means of assessing the effects of controlled coexpression of dsbgenes on specific target proteins expressed from compatible plasmids. The results revealed a striking enhancement of periplasmic production of NGF, particularly when both DsbC catalyzing the isomerization and its membrane-associated modulator DsbD are simultaneously overexpressed. E. coli K12 strain JM109 (F−, recA1,endA1, gyrA96, thi-1,supE44, relA1, Δ(lac ΔproAB), (F′ traD36, proAB,lacIq lacZΔM15), mcrA) (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) was used as the expression host throughout the experiments. DM391 (dsbB null mutant of CA8000) (31Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and SR2612 (dsbD null mutant of MC4100) (14Missiakas D. Schwager F. Raina S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by D. Missiakas. Plasmid pT7Blue® was purchased from Novagen. Expression vector pARK2 for Dsb proteins was constructed by inserting a fragment of pTrc99A containing arrnBT1T2 terminator region into a derivative of pAR3, pACYC184-based arabinose-inducible expression plasmid compatible with ColE1-derived plasmids (32Perez-Perez J. Gutierrez J. Gene. 1995; 158: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for the target protein NGF are derivatives of pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which allowed expression of NGF fused in frame to downstream of OmpA, OmpT, or MalE signal peptide, respectively, under controls of thetrc promoter and the lacIq repressor and designated pTrc-OmpA, pTrc-OmpT, and pTrc-MalE, respectively. Vectors carrying each of the signal sequences (synthetic oligonucleotides) were constructed, and the coding region of the NGF gene (R & D Systems) was inserted downstream of pTrc-OmpA, pTrc-OmpT, and pTrc-MalE, and the resulting plasmids were designated pTrc-OmpA-NGF, pTrc-OmpT-NGF, and pTrc-MalE-NGF, respectively. Some codons rarely used in E. coli were replaced by those used more frequently to improve translational efficiency of the mature form of the NGF gene; TCA (Ser1 and Ser2), CCC (Pro5), and AGG (Arg9) were replaced by AGC, CCG, and CGC, respectively. Each dsbgene (plus the respective or slightly modified Shine-Dalgarno sequence) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as follows:dsbA, dsbB, and dsbC genes were amplified with KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), anddsbD was amplified with LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) and cloned into pT7Blue®. dsbA was amplified using 5′ CGGGAGCTCATCGGAGAGAGTAGA 3′ and 5′ GGCCCGGGAATTATTATTTTTTCTCGGA 3′ as primers and pSK220 (33Akiyama Y. Kamitani S. Kusukawa N. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22440-22445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template, and the PCR product was digested with SacI andAvaI, purified, and cloned into theSacI-AvaI site of pT7Blue®. Similarly,dsbB was amplified using 5′ GGCCCGGGCTGCGCACTCTATGCATATTGCAGGG 3′ and 5′ GGCATATGGATTATTAGCGACCGAACAGATCACG3′ as primers and pSS51 (34Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as template, and the PCR product was digested with AvaI andNdeI, purified, and cloned into theAvaI-NdeI site of pT7Blue®. dsbC was amplified using 5′ GGCATATGAGGAGGAAGATTTATGAAGAAAGG3′ and 5′ CCGTCGACGATTATTATTTACCGCTGGTCATTTTTTGGTGTTCG 3′ as primers and Kohara λ clone number 468 as template, and the PCR product was digested withNdeI and SalI, purified, and cloned into theNdeI-SalI site of pT7Blue®. dsbD was amplified using 5′ CCGTCGACGAGGCCGACATGCAGCTGCCGCAAGGCGTCTGGC 3′ and 5′ CCGCATGCTTATCACGGTTGGCGATCGCGC 3′ as primers and Kohara λ clone number 648 as template, and the PCR product was digested withSalI and SphI, purified, and cloned into theSalI-SphI site of pT7Blue®. The structure of the resulting plasmids were confirmed by sequencing and designated pT7dsbA, pT7dsbB, pT7dsbC, and pT7dsbD, respectively. Plasmids carrying an artificial subset of the dsb genes in four combinations were then constructed. The SacI-AvaI fragment (∼0.6 kbp) of pT7dsbA was inserted into theSacI-AvaI site of pT7dsbB or pT7dsbC to yield pT7dsbAB or pT7dsbAC, respectively. The SalI-SphI fragment (∼1.5 kbp) of pT7dsbD was inserted into theSalI-SphI site of pT7dsbB or pT7dsbC to yield pT7dsbBD or pT7dsbCD, respectively. For construction of the entire set of dsbABCDgenes, the SacI-NdeI fragment (∼1.1 kbp) of pT7dsbAB was inserted into theSacI-NdeI site of pT7dsbCD to yield pT7dsbABCD. Each subset of the genes obtained above was placed under the control of the araB promoter and the araC regulatory gene on a pACYC184-based vector (pARK2); the SacI-HindIII fragment of pT7dsbAB, pT7dsbAC, pT7dsbBD, pT7dsbCD, or pT7dsbABCD was inserted into the SacI-HindIII site of pARK2, yielding pDbAB1, pDbAC1, pDbBD1, pDbCD1, or pDbABCD1, respectively. pDbABCD2 is a kanamycin-resistant version of pDbABCD1 that was constructed by inserting the BstBI-BstBI fragment of pDbABCD1 (∼4.8 kbp) into pAR3kan carrying kanamycin (instead of chloramphenicol) resistance gene. E. coli JM109 cells carrying an NGF expression plasmid such as pTrc-OmpT-NGF and a pDb plasmid were grown in L broth (35Tobe T. Ito K. Yura T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 37 °C. When a culture reached 20 Klett units (number 66 filter), Dsb proteins were induced by adding l-arabinose to the medium, and 30 min later, NGF was induced by adding 50 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). All chemicals were of analytical grade supplied by Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan) or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Samples of cells (200 μl) were harvested by centrifugation, and periplasmic proteins were obtained by osmotic disruption of spheroplasts; cells were first resuspended into 100 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20% sucrose, lysozyme was added to 0.1 mg/ml, and cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After adding MgCl2 to 50 mm, the sample was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was taken as periplasmic fraction. The spheroplast pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 5 mm MgCl2, sonicated for 10 min, centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h on a Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor, and the supernatant was withdrawn as the cytoplasmic fraction. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 5 mm MgCl2, 1% octylglucoside, incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was used as the membrane fraction, and the pellet was used as the insoluble fraction. Whole-cell proteins were prepared separately by precipitating a portion (200 μl) of the culture directly with trichloroacetic acid (36Yamamori T. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Each of the above fractions was resuspended in SDS sample buffer, either directly or after trichloroacetic acid precipitation and washing with acetone, and heat-treated essentially as described (37Yano R. Nagai H. Shiba K. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins (corresponding to equal optical density) were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by visualization with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by immunoblotting with specific polyclonal antibody against NGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), DsbA (kindly donated by Y. Akiyama), β-lactamase (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), alkaline phosphatase (Nordic Immunological Laboratories), or DnaJ (StressGen, Inc.). The detection system used was either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse antibody and an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse antibody, nitroblue tetrazolium chloride, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad, Inc.). Quantification was carried out by an Intelligent Quantifier apparatus (BioImage Systems Co., Tokyo, Japan). E. coli JM109 cells carrying pTrc-OmpT-NGF and pDbCD1 (or pDbABCD1 or vector alone) was grown in L broth (400 ml × 2) and induced for expression of Dsb proteins followed by that of OmpT-NGF for 8 h. Cells were harvested and washed with 0.85% NaCl, and 4 g of wet cells were resuspended in 40 ml of buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Periplasmic fraction was prepared and concentrated by a Centiprep 10 concentrator (Amicon), and the buffer was adjusted to 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmEDTA and adsorbed to Affi-prep Polymixin Matrix (Bio-Rad) by shaking overnight on a rotary shaker at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA and applied to a DEAE Toyopearl column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). After washing the column with the same buffer containing 0.2 m KCl, NGF was eluted with the buffer containing 0.5 m KCl. The eluate was concentrated on a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon) to ∼2 ml and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmEDTA. This procedure removed >80% of proteins without apparent loss of activity. The partially purified NGF thus obtained was assayed for activity by adding serial dilutions of sample to rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (30Fujimori K. Fukuzono S. Kotomura N. Kuno N. Shimizu N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 1985-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum using 24-well collagen-coated plates. Mouse NGF (Biomedical Technologies Inc.) served as a standard for comparison. Neurite outgrowth was observed under a microscope after incubation of plates at 37 °C in 5% humidified CO2 for 7 days. ThedsbA, dsbB, dsbC, and dsbDgenes were cloned and tandemly joined in various combinations to obtain artificial operons under the araB promoter on a pACYC184-based plasmid, pARK2. Each of the dsb genes contained the entire coding region with short flanking regions on both sides including a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence but not a transcription terminator. Several pairwise combined genes (dsbAB, dsbAC, dsbCD, anddsbBD) and the complete set of genes (dsbABCD) were initially cloned on a high copy plasmid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each set of the genes was then placed under the araB promoter controlled by the araCregulatory gene on pARK2 vector, and the resulting plasmids were designated pDbAB1, pDbAC1, pDbBD1, pDbCD1, and pDbABCD1 (Fig.1). These plasmids are compatible with ColE1-type plasmids generally used for expression of recombinant proteins. When l-arabinose was added to an L broth culture ofE. coli carrying each of the expression plasmids, the respective Dsb proteins were induced to various levels depending on the arabinose concentration used (Fig.2 B). DsbA protein (21 kDa) was detected by Western blotting with DsbA-specific antibody, whereas DsbC protein (24 kDa) was detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A), although the mobility observed was appreciably slower than that predicted from the primary structure as observed previously by Missiakas et al. (21Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of DsbB and DsbD from the plasmids was confirmed by their abilities to complement the defective phenotypes (higher sensitivity to dithiothreitol or to CuSO4) of the respective deletion mutants (data not shown). The growth of host bacteria carrying pDbABCD1 that can express all the Dsb proteins was not affected significantly by addition of l-arabinose up to 200 μg/ml, which was adopted as the standard condition. The human NGF gene was fused with a signal peptide of ompA, ompT, or malE to facilitate membrane transport and was expressed in JM109 cells. When these NGF fusion proteins were induced by adding 0.1 mm IPTG at 37 °C, their production was detected within 30 min, gradually increased for about 90 min, and cell growth was retarded depending on the kind of signal peptide used. When the ompA ormalE signal was used, a marked growth inhibition was observed, whereas the ompT signal caused only slight inhibition (Fig. 3 A). Such differential effects of the various signal peptides suggested that certain anomaly in membrane transport of NGF fusion protein caused inhibition of cell growth. Indeed, the amount of periplasmic enzyme β-lactamase was clearly reduced upon induction of OmpA-NGF or MalE-NGF (data not shown). We then introduced the Dsb expression plasmid (pDbABCD1) into the above strains and examined the effects of Dsb coexpression on cell growth. The growth inhibition observed upon OmpA-NGF or MalE-NGF expression was found to be exacerbated when Dsb proteins were coexpressed; no clones carrying both the OmpA-NGF and pDbABCD1 (or pDbAB1) expression plasmids were obtained even after prolonged incubation. Although a clone carrying both OmpA-NGF and pDbCD1 expression plasmids was obtained, no accumulation of NGF or β-lactamase was observed (data not shown). In contrast, the slight but significant growth inhibition observed upon OmpT-NGF expression was completely relieved when the Dsb proteins were coexpressed by addition of l-arabinose (Fig. 3 B). These results suggested that OmpT-NGF fusion protein can be successfully transported to the periplasm at least to some extent and that membrane transport of this, as well as other periplasmic proteins, is enhanced by overproduction of Dsb proteins in the periplasm. To determine whether overexpression of the Dsb proteins enhances production of NGF possibly through assisting the folding of OmpT-NGF, various sets of Dsb proteins were coexpressed from the expression plasmids, and their effects on the amount of OmpT-NGF produced and on periplasmic localization were compared. Coexpression of DsbAB or DsbCD should enhance the efficiencies of either disulfide bond formation or isomerization, respectively, whereas that of DsbAC increases both the disulfide bond formation and isomerization activities. Under these conditions, coexpression of OmpT-NGF did not affect the levels of DsbA and DsbC significantly (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, the control cells carrying the pACYC184 vector produced NGF of which about 30% was found in the periplasmic fraction after induction for 3.5 h (lanes 1 and 6). Coexpression of DsbAB hardly affected the total or periplasmic expression of NGF (lanes 2 and7), whereas that of DsbAC increased the total yield nearly 2-fold but hardly increased the periplasmic production (lanes 3 and 8). Essentially the same result was obtained when the level of DsbAC coexpression was further enhanced by using a higher concentration of arabinose (data not shown). In contrast, coexpression of DsbCD enhanced the total NGF production by about 2-fold and the periplasmic expression by about 3-fold over the vector control; namely, about 60% of total NGF was recovered in the periplasm (lanes 4 and 9). Even higher periplasmic production of NGF (∼80%) was observed when all the Dsb proteins (DsbABCD) were overexpressed (lanes 5 and 10). In the presence of excess DsbCD or DsbABCD (but not DsbAB), NGF was significantly stabilized, which probably explains the increase in total NGF production (data not shown). To further assess the effects of DsbABCD coexpression on OmpT-NGF production, we varied the level of Dsb coexpression and analyzed its effect on distribution of NGF into several distinct subcellular fractions. The extent of Dsb coexpression, within the range tested, hardly affected the total amount of NGF produced, whereas NGF obtained in the periplasmic fraction increased markedly with increasing level of Dsb coexpression (Fig.5 A), concomitant with the decrease in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 5 B). Again, about 80% of the total NGF produced was found in the periplasm at the maximum Dsb coexpression. Only the band with mobility characteristic of the mature NGF was detected, suggesting that the signal peptide was effectively removed from the precursor OmpT-NGF by processing. The periplasmic fraction analyzed contained most of β-lactamase and alkaline phosphatase as expected but very little cytoplasmic protein, DnaJ (Fig. 5 A). Thus, NGF found in the periplasmic fraction most probably represents soluble forms of protein that had been successfully processed and correctly folded in the periplasm. To further substantiate the above possibility, we determined the biological activity of soluble NGF found in the periplasm by using neurite outgrowth assay with rat PC12 cells. To remove proteins toxic to the cells while minimizing possible denaturation or refolding of NGF produced, the periplasmic fraction was concentrated without salt precipitation followed by treatments with affinity and ion-exchange columns. Bioassays with serial dilutions of product revealed that NGF found in the periplasm upon DsbCD (or DsbABCD) overexpression exhibit activity comparable with that of authentic mouse NGF (Fig.6, B and C). On the other hand, the NGF recovered from similar periplasmic fraction obtained without overexpression of Dsb proteins, even after 4-fold concentration, failed to show any detectable activity (Fig.6 A), indicating that NGF produced under these conditions is hardly active. These results strongly suggest that NGF produced and transported to the periplasm in E. coli become biologically active only when assisted by extensive overexpression of DsbCD (or DsbABCD). We have constructed a set of versatile plasmids for controlled expression of Dsb proteins to assess the effects of coexpression on periplasmic production of recombinant proteins in E. coli. These plasmids permit coordinate induction of different sets of Dsb proteins by manipulating their expression levels and timing independently from that of the target recombinant protein. The maximum extents of overproduction for DsbA and DsbC proteins were severalfold higher than the normal levels but hardly affected cell growth under the conditions employed. Among the three signal peptides tested, the OmpT signal turned out to be most effective for producing soluble NGF with apparently little effects on translocation of periplasmic proteins and host cell growth, and the slight inhibitory effect on growth was overcome by overexpressing the whole set of Dsb proteins (Fig. 3). In contrast, when the OmpA or MalE signal was used, marked growth inhibition was observed upon induction of NGF presumably because of defective membrane transport of secretory proteins; however, this defect was not rescued by overproduction of Dsb proteins. Although the mechanism of secretion defects remains obscure, the N terminus of mature NGF containing three consecutive serine residues tends to form a β-turn structure and could be involved in translocation inhibition of NGF precursor. The present results revealed that such inhibition can be alleviated by using an appropriate signal peptide. Among the subsets of Dsb proteins tested, coexpression of DsbCD but not DsbAB was effective and that of DsbABCD was most effective for obtaining soluble NGF in the periplasm (Fig. 4). Thus, although coexpression of DsbAB alone has little effect, that of both DsbAB and DsbCD are highly effective perhaps through synergistic function between two pairs of proteins in assisting folding of NGF. Although DsbCD could assist transport of the target protein directly or indirectly by pulling the precursor into the periplasm (17Joly J.C. Leung W.S. Swartz J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it seems more likely that overexpressed DsbCD proteins efficiently promoted isomerization of aberrant disulfide bonds formed on nascent NGF, thus yielding correctly folded products. Sone et al. (16Sone M. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10349-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpressed DsbC acts as disulfide isomerase on the mutant alkaline phosphatase, which contains aberrant disulfide bonds formed between consecutive cysteine residues. However, only a limited success was reported on disulfide isomerase-assisted periplasmic production of heterologous proteins that contain multiple disulfide bonds between nonconsecutive cysteine residues (nonconsecutive-type) (17Joly J.C. Leung W.S. Swartz J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Ostermeier M. De Sutter K. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10616-10622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The success probably depends not only on overexpression of the DsbC isomerase but also on maintaining the disulfide-reductase activity of DsbC in the oxidized environment of periplasm. Coexpression of rat protein disulfide isomerase in E. coli significantly increased the total yield of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, which has three disulfide bonds of nonconsecutive type but failed to reduce the amount of incorrectly folded products (29Ostermeier M. De Sutter K. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10616-10622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When DsbC was overexpressed with insulin-like growth hormone I, which also has three nonconsecutive disulfide bonds, the total or insoluble products increased but not the periplasmic products, despite the fact that the active site cysteine residues of DsbC were kept partially reduced (17Joly J.C. Leung W.S. Swartz J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the course of the present study, Qiu et al. (38Qiu J. Swartz J.R. Georgiou G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported production of a soluble and active human tissue plasminogen activator that has 527 amino acid residues and 17 nonconsecutive disulfide bonds in the E. coli periplasm by overexpressing DsbC (38Qiu J. Swartz J.R. Georgiou G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this case, overexpressed DsbC might act stoichiometrically rather than catalytically, and the inactivated DsbC could inhibit the membrane transport of precursor DsbC and other proteins essential for cell growth. The present results based on the differences between DsbAC and DsbCD coexpression suggested that overexpression of DsbC is necessary but not sufficient for obtaining maximum periplasmic production of NGF; coexpression of DsbC with DsbD, which is presumably required for regenerating DsbC, appeared to be crucial for efficient isomerization of disulfide bonds in the E. coli periplasm. Consistent with this proposal, expression of a bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor containing three disulfide bonds (nonconsecutive-type) yielded intermediates mostly with aberrant disulfide bonds in a dsbD deletion mutant (14Missiakas D. Schwager F. Raina S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Similarly, the yield of active human placental alkaline phosphatase was low, whereas bacterial alkaline phosphatase was normally produced in thedipZ (dsbD) mutant presumably because of formation of aberrant disulfide bonds (39Beck R. Burtscher H. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It thus seems clear that DsbD, as well as DsbC, can become overloaded upon overexpression of heterologous proteins having multiple disulfide bonds. Because the increasing levels of DsbABCD coexpression enhance the amount of soluble NGF found in the periplasm with concomitant decrease in insoluble products, the overproduced Dsb proteins are most likely to enhance the periplasmic folding of NGF by preventing aggregation. Coexpression of DsbAB was hardly effective in this respect, suggesting that enhanced disulfide-forming activity alone is not sufficient for facilitating the protein folding. In contrast, coexpression of DsbAC, DsbCD, or DsbABCD markedly enhanced the total amount of NGF produced (Fig. 4). Overexpression of DsbC therefore appears to protect the product in some way from proteolysis; in fact, the NGF product was stabilized in the presence of excess DsbCD or DsbABCD proteins. On the other hand, increased periplasmic production of NGF was observed only when DsbC and DsbD were simultaneously coexpressed (DsbCD or DsbABCD). This suggests that DsbC can assist conversion of aberrant disulfides of NGF to the native form but cannot release native, soluble products in the absence of sufficient amounts of DsbD. The results of bioassay revealed that recombinant NGF produced with DsbCD overexpression has activity similar to that of authentic NGF, suggesting that correct folding of NGF was efficiently catalyzed by overexpressed DsbCD proteins. Detailed mechanisms of disulfide isomerization including the mode of modulation of DsbC activity by DsbD or other factors should have important bearings on further understanding and improving of periplasmic production of recombinant proteins that require complex disulfide bond formation. After completion of this work, two laboratories reported correction of the primary structure of DsbD (40Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 41Chung J. Chen T. Missiakas D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which indicated that translation of the dsbD gene begins at a start codon 76 codons upstream of that previously thought. Because the present expression plasmids were constructed on the basis of previously reported gene structure, the excess DsbD proteins obtained here lack the N-terminal 76 amino acid residues (including 26 possible signal sequences). However, the dsbD gene used did complement the defective phenotype of dsbD null mutant, and overexpression of DsbCD (but not DsbAC) exerted distinct effects on the periplasmic expression of NGF (Fig. 4), suggesting active participation of the excess DsbD produced; the truncated DsbD should retain all the cysteine residues that may be required for the disulfide oxidoreductase activity. We therefore believe that the essential finding and conclusion of this work remains unaffected, although the effect of DsbD overexpression observed here may have been underestimated. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that disulfide bond isomerization of NGF can be efficiently and synergistically catalyzed by overexpression of DsbC and its modulator DsbD. Excess DsbC protein appears to be successfully transported to the periplasm, and its activity can be effectively maintained by simultaneous supply of excess DsbD. We also found recently that periplasmic production of horseradish peroxidase containing multiple disulfide bonds and unstable in E. coli is much improved by overexpressing Dsb proteins (42Kurokawa Y. Yanagi H. Yura T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3960-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Dsb coexpression plasmids such as those reported here should prove useful for studying production of heterologous proteins with multiple disulfide bonds and prone to aggregation or degradation upon secretion to the periplasm.

It has also been reported that the up-regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and/or manganese superoxide dismutase protects endothelial cells against oxLDL-induced apoptosis (32Dimmeler S.

Collectively, these reports reveal an intriguing link between oxLDL, apoptosis, and nitric oxide (⋅NO)/superoxide (O⨪2) interaction in endothelial cells.Nitric oxide has been reported to have a dual effect on cell-dependent LDL oxidation (33Jessup W. Mohr O.D. Gieseg S.P. Dean R.T. Stocker R. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26066-26075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction between⋅NO and O⨪2 to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−) is one of the most facile radical-radical recombination reactions in free radical biology (37Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6665) Google Scholar, 38Hui R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). ⋅NO also reacts with lipid peroxyl radical (LOO⋅) at a nearly diffusion-controlled rate (k = 1–3 × 109 m −1 s−1) (39Padmaja S. Hui R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This rate constant is ∼107 times greater than that reported for the reaction between LOO⋅ and unsaturated lipid, and 104 times greater than the rate constant for the reaction of LOO⋅ with α-tocopherol (36Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S. Kirk M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26066-26075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ⋅NO can act as a potent chain-breaking antioxidant. Consequently, the reaction between⋅NO and O⨪2 has the combined effect of removing an antioxidant such as ⋅NO, and generating the prooxidant, ONOO−. The role of these reactions in regulating downstream apoptosis cell signaling has not been fully investigated.In vivo immunohistochemical studies in atherosclerotic tissues indicate the presence of oxidation and nitration marker products (i.e. lipid hydroperoxides and nitrotyrosine) that are diagnostic for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (23Leeuwenburgh C.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that the propagation of lipid peroxidation is primarily responsible for oxLDL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the effects of extracellular and intracellular ⋅NO donors (NONOates), cell-permeable SOD mimetics and ONOO− scavengers (MnTBAP and FeTBAP), a cell-permeable mimetic of glutathione peroxidase and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (ebselen), lipophilic phenolic antioxidant (probucol), and a nitrone spin trap α-phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) (Fig.1) on endothelial apoptosis induced by oxLDL. Results show that ⋅NO inhibits oxLDL-induced apoptosis as do MnTBAP/FeTBAP, ebselen, Probucol, and PBN. These structurally diverse antioxidants share a common mechanism that is their ability to inhibit the propagation of lipid peroxidation. Therefore, we propose that the major antiapoptotic mechanism of ⋅NO involves peroxyl radical scavenging.

Individual subunits of RAD52 self-associate into rings that can then form higher order complexes. RAD52 binds to double-strand DNA ends, and recent studies suggest that the higher order self-association of the rings promotes DNA end-joining. Earlier studies defined the self-association domain of RAD52 to a unique region in the N-terminal half of the protein. Here we show that there are in fact two experimentally separable self-association domains in RAD52. The N-terminal self-association domain mediates the assembly of monomers into rings, and the previously unidentified domain in the C-terminal half of the protein mediates higher order self-association of the rings.

The determinants of self-association were proposed to exist exclusively within a region defined by residues 65–165, a result supported by recent studies of several isoforms of RAD52 (19Kito K. Wada H. Yeh E.T. Kamitani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy (EM) studies of Rad52p and RAD52 have revealed formation of ring-shaped structures (9–13 nm in diameter), as well as higher order aggregates (9Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol.

Stasiak et al.(21Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Dyck E.V. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) performed image analyses of negatively stained electron micrographs and determined that the 10-nm RAD52 rings are composed of seven subunits. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis indicated a mean mass of 330 ± 59 kDa supporting a heptameric ring-shaped RAD52 structure (21Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Dyck E.V. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that RAD52 binds to double-stranded DNA ends as an aggregated complex (20Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These end-binding complexes were amorphous in shape and ranged in size from 15 to 60 nm. Within these complexes, RAD52 rings were observed occasionally. Binding of RAD52 to the DNA ends promoted end-to-end association between DNA molecules and stimulated ligation of both cohesive and blunt DNA ends (20Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Therefore, given that the formation of both ring-shaped oligomers and aggregates of these rings seem relevant to RAD52 function, we sought to investigate further the self-association properties of the RAD52 protein. We performed a series of analyses comparing full-length RAD52-(1–418) with two different mutant RAD52 proteins: (i) a 1–192 mutant that spans the N-terminal portion and includes the entire proposed DNA binding and self-association domains and (ii) a 218–418 mutant that spans the C-terminal portion of RAD52 that includes the proposed RPA- and RAD51-binding domains (Fig. 1). In contrast to previous studies, our results show that there are experimentally separable determinants for two different modes of self-association by RAD52, one in the N-terminal and one in the C-terminal portion of the protein. Wild-type RAD52 andRAD52-(1–192) pET28 expression plasmids were a gift from Dr. M. Park and have six histidines fused to the C terminus. A pET28 expression plasmid containing the thioredoxin-RAD52-(218–418) fusion protein was constructed using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques. Cultures of transformed BL21(DE3) Codon Plus Escherichia coli (Stratagene) were grown in a fermentor and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Wild-typeRAD52 and RAD52-(1–192) cells were resuspended in a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm hexylglucopyranoside, and 1 mm EDTA.RAD52-(218–418) cells were resuspended in a buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 500 mm KCl, 500 mm LiSO4, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm benzamidine) were used throughout purification. Cells were lysed using a French press, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation, filtration through Cell Debris Remover-modified cellulose (Whatman), and passage through a 0.22-μm pore filter. The clarified lysate was applied to an MC/M Ni2+ affinity column (PerSeptive Biosystems) that was optimally washed and eluted with an imidazole gradient. Wild-type RAD52 and RAD52-(1–192) then were dialyzed extensively against a buffer consisting of 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm hexylglucopyranoside, and 1 mm EDTA. RAD52-(218–418) was dialyzed extensively against a buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2.5% glycerol, 2.5 mmEDTA, and 0.5 mm hexylglucopyranoside and then purified further by anion exchange using an HQ/M column (PerSeptive Biosystems) eluted with a KCl gradient. Protein samples were concentrated using Amicon concentrators with YM10 membranes, and protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The expression plasmid for wild-type RPA heterotrimer was a gift from Dr. M. Wold. RPA was expressed and purified as described (22Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was done at room temperature. Briefly, 10 pmol of wild-type RAD52, RAD52 mutants, or BSA were coated to microtiter plates for 1 h. Plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.02% Tween 20 to remove unbound protein. Plates then were blocked with 5% milk in PBS for 10 min and then washed. Various amounts of RPA in PBS and 5% milk were added and incubated for 1 h. Plates then were washed to remove nonspecific interactions and probed with a monoclonal antibody against the 70-kDa subunit of RPA (Calbiochem) in PBS and 5% milk for 30 min. Plates then were washed and probed with anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in PBS and 5% milk for 30 min and washed. Plates were developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in phosphate-citrate buffer with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. Color was developed for 30 min, the reaction was stopped with 1.5 m H2SO4, and absorbance readings at 450 nm were taken with a microtiter plate reader. Background absorbance was determined from a blank well and then subtracted from the data. Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 nm 5′-end-labeled 95 base oligonucleotide (concentration in bases), and the indicated amounts of protein. The oligonucleotide sequence is as follows: 5′-AGA CGA TAG CGA AGG CGT AGC AGA AAC TAA CGA AGA TTT TGG CGG TGG TCT GAA CGA CAT CTT TGA GGC GCA GAA AAT CGA GTG GCA CTA ATA AG-3′. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min followed by the addition of glutaraldehyde to 0.2% and continued incubation at 22 °C for 20 min. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 1.6% (w/v) and samples (10 μl) were loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel and electrophoresed at 100 mV in 0.5× TBE buffer (90 mM Tris, 64.6 mM boric acid, and 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.3). Gels were analyzed using a Molecular Imager FX and QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). The 95-base oligonucleotide used in the gel-shift assays was made using an ABI 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. DLS was carried out using a DynaPro-801 molecular sizing instrument equipped with a microsampler (Protein Solutions). A 50-μl sample was passed through a filtering assembly into a 12-μl chamber quartz cuvette. For RAD52-(1–192) and RAD52-(218–418), 20-nm filters were used. For wild-type RAD52, a 100-nm filter was used. The data were analyzed first using Dynamics 4.0 software and then DynaLS software as follows. Hydrodynamic radii (RH) for monomodal distributions, as defined by a baseline ranging from 0.977 to 1.002, were reported from Dynamics 4.0. Bi- and multimodal distributions were analyzed using DynaLS. DynaLS data estimates of molecular weight were obtained from RH using Dynamics 3.0 molecular weight calculator. Sum of squares errors less than 5000 were considered negligible. Proteins were prepared for EM by diluting wild-type or mutant RAD52 to 4.0 μm in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm KCl. Samples were spread onto thin carbon films on holey carbon grids (400 mesh), stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and visualized by transmission electron microscopy using a Philips CM10 microscope. Analyses were carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory using unstained, unshadowed freeze-dried samples. Protein samples (∼0.1 mg/ml) were applied to a thin carbon film supported by a thick holey film on titanium grids and freeze-dried overnight. The microscope operates at 40 kV. Operation of the STEM and data analyses were performed as described previously (23Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Simon M.N. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 139-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of the RAD52-(218–418) protein at 1.2 mg/ml were loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech/LKB) equilibrated in buffer containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 400 mmNaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA. Analysis was performed using a BioLogic chromatography system (Bio-Rad) with an in-line UV detector. EM analyses of wild-type RAD52 and RAD52-(1–192) show that both proteins form ring-shaped structures (Figs. 2 and 3). The average diameter of these particles, measured across the surface with the central pore, is 10 ± 1 nm, consistent with previous reports (9Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Wild-type RAD52 also forms distinct larger particles that appear as various sized spheres and half-spheres ranging in diameter from 30 to 100 nm (Fig.2). These particles consist of individual 10-nm rings as well as other less distinct compressed structures. For RAD52-(1–192) the majority of protein forms ring-shaped oligomers, and no larger particles were seen (Fig. 3). Even at increased concentrations (6 and 10 μm) RAD52-(1–192) shows no larger aggregates (data not shown). Higher magnifications reveal “protrusions” extending from the 10-nm rings formed by wild-type RAD52 that are missing in the 1–192 protein (see arrows in Fig. 3, B and D). These protrusions likely correspond to those modeled by Stasiak et al. (21Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Dyck E.V. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and our data show that they are part of the C-terminal portion of RAD52.Figure 3Negative stained electron micrographs of wild-type RAD52 and RAD52-(1–192) protein. Proteins (4.0 μm) were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The majority of protein for both wild-type RAD52 (A and B) and RAD52-(1–192) (C andD) forms 10-nm diameter ring-shaped oligomers. Larger particles of wild-type RAD52 in A (also see Fig. 2) are not formed by RAD52-(1–192). Higher magnifications of both proteins reveal that the protrusions observed on the 10-nm rings of wild-type RAD52 are missing in the RAD52-(1–192) rings (arrows in Band D). Black bars = 0.05 μm inA and C and 0.01 μm in B andD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) STEM analyses of wild-type RAD52 (2 μm) showed particle sizes ranging from 175 to 625 kDa with a mass average of 298 ± 69 kDa (n = 309; Fig.4 A). Given a molecular mass of 48 kDa for the His-tagged RAD52 protein, this range corresponds to particles that contain from 4 to 13 subunits with an average of six subunits. Similar analyses of the 1–192 protein showed particle sizes ranging from 100 to 350 kDa with a mass average of 227 ± 30 kDa (n = 277; Fig. 4 B). For a monomer molecular mass of 23 kDa, this range corresponds to particles that contain from 4 to 15 subunits with an average of 10 subunits. Resolution of the ring-shaped oligomers in the electron micrographs was not high enough to count individual subunits, but our STEM data are consistent with previous work in which oligomeric rings of wild-type RAD52 were determined to be heptameric (21Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Dyck E.V. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The oligomeric distribution of these proteins in solution was investigated by DLS. Wild-type RAD52 shows a multimodal profile with three peaks corresponding to particles with an average hydrodynamic radius of 6.6, 27.6, and 711.0 nm, respectively (TableI). These likely correspond to ring-shaped oligomers, the 30-nm particles described previously as “super-rings” (12Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and seen in our micrographs (Fig. 2), and larger aggregates also observed in our micrographs. We find that the percent distribution of these various sized particles is effected by protein concentration, i.e. with increasing concentration the larger aggregates account for a larger percentage of the population. In contrast to wild type, RAD52-(1–192) shows a monomodal light-scattering profile that corresponds to a particle with a hydrodynamic radius of 6.1 nm (Table I), which is in agreement with our EM analysis.Table IDynamic light-scattering measurements of RAD52 proteinsProteinConcentrationBase lineModalitySOS 1-aSOS, sum of squares.RH1-bAverage hydrodynamic radius (RH) is reported with the polydispersity (width of the distribution in nm) given in parentheses.Molecular massPeak1-cFor DynaLS results the percent peak area for the solvent peak is not reported. areamg/mlerrornmkDa%RAD523.51.007Multimodal3.106.6 (0.7)27910.527.6 (9.3)9.05 × 10385.8711.0 (245)2.40 × 1073.7RAD52-(1–192)151.001Monomodal1.955.7 (1.2)200RAD52-(218–418)21.001Monomodal0.644.6 (2.1)118Thioredoxin11.001Monomodal3.32.0 (0.8)14.81-a SOS, sum of squares.1-b Average hydrodynamic radius (RH) is reported with the polydispersity (width of the distribution in nm) given in parentheses.1-c For DynaLS results the percent peak area for the solvent peak is not reported. Open table in a new tab The above analyses indicate at least two modes of RAD52 self-association that are experimentally separable, (i) formation of ring-shaped oligomers and (ii) formation of larger aggregates. Because the latter seems to depend largely on the presence of residues C-terminal to position 192, we performed a number of assays to test for self-association on a mutant RAD52 containing only residues 218–418. Initial EM studies showed no distinct structural characteristics for this protein (data not shown), but STEM analysis revealed particle sizes ranging from 75 to 275 kDa (Fig. 4 C) with a mass average of 153 ± 40 kDa (n = 119; Fig.4 C). Given a monomer molecular mass of 39 kDa, the particle composition ranges from two to seven subunits with an average of four subunits. Gel filtration shows a homogeneous peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 166 kDa (Fig. 5) and therefore to a particle containing approximately four subunits. Analysis by DLS shows a monomodal peak corresponding to a particle with an average RH of 4.6 nm and a molecular mass of 118 kDa (therefore containing approximately three subunits). DLS measurements on thioredoxin alone show that it does not contribute to the oligomeric character of thioredoxin-RAD52-(218–418) (Table I). Together, these data indicate that the C-terminal portion of RAD52 (residues 218–418) contains determinants of protein self-association that are distinct from those required to form 10-nm rings. Binding of wild-type RAD52 and RAD52-(1–192) to single-stranded DNA was analyzed by gel-shift assays. The gels in Fig.6 are representative of five different experiments, each of which gave similar results. In each case, analysis of unbound and bound DNA (including that in the gel well) gave rise to a KD(app) of 35 and 25 nmfor wild-type RAD52 and RAD52-(1–192), respectively. This slight enhancement in binding affinity was observed consistently for RAD52-(1–192). With wild-type RAD52 a significant portion of bound DNA remained in the gel well, a result that likely reflects the ability of the wild-type protein to form greater amounts of self-aggregates than the 1–192 mutant protein (see below). Additionally, 100% of the DNA (2 nm total nucleotides) was bound by the 1–192 protein at 40–60 nm protein in the titration profile, whereas 100% binding by wild-type RAD52 consistently required greater than 100 nm protein. Assays using the RAD52-(218–418) mutant protein showed no DNA binding up to 2.0 μm protein (data not shown). These results show that the DNA binding domain of RAD52 is contained within the N-terminal portion of the protein and that removal of the C-terminal 227 residues results in a slight enhancement of DNA binding. Previous studies have mapped residues 221–280 as the domain in RAD52 that interacts with the 32-kDa subunit of RPA (16Park M.S. Ludwig D.L. Stigger E. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18996-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To ensure that the 218–418 mutant construct maintained a native fold, we tested this protein for interaction with RPA using an immunoassay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that the 218–418 protein interacted with RPA with an affinity similar to that observed for wild-type RAD52 (Fig.7). No interaction with RPA was observed for RAD52-(1–192), thioredoxin, or BSA. Previous studies have shown that RAD52 exists in a number of oligomeric states ranging from rings with a 10-nm diameter to larger complexes with diameters of greater than 30 nm (9Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol.

Recent observations indicate a direct role for these higher order protein-protein interactions in promoting DNA end-joining (20Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to investigate the self-association properties of RAD52 utilizing an array of biophysical techniques. In our EM studies of wild-type RAD52 and RAD52-(1–192), we observed ring structures with an average diameter of 10 ± 1 nm as has been reported previously (9Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, and as seen previously (12Van Dyck E. Hajibagheri N.M.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C.

Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we observed protrusions extending from wild-type RAD52 rings as well as a population of distinct larger particles. However, neither the protrusions nor the larger particles were observed with RAD52-(1–192). This suggests that residues within the C-terminal portion of the protein (residues 193–418) make up these protrusions and carry determinants for higher order RAD52 self-association. DLS analysis of wild-type RAD52 and the two mutant proteins provides additional and complementary evidence for two distinct modes of RAD52 self-association. DLS analysis of wild-type RAD52 shows three peaks that likely correspond to the 10-nm ring-shaped oligomers and the 30-nm and larger particles observed by EM. In contrast, both RAD52-(1–192) and RAD52-(218–418) show a monomodal DLS profile indicating the presence of a single population of structures. The RAD52-(1–192) RH is consistent with a ring structure, and the RAD52-(218–418) RH indicates a complex composed of three subunits. This self-association of RAD52-(218–418) was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography and STEM. The ability of RAD52-(218–418) to self-associate was unexpected. Previous studies have suggested that residues 65–165 define the exclusive self-association domain in the RAD52 protein (18Shen Z. Peterson S.R. Comeaux J.C. Zastrow D. Moyzis R.K. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Shenet al. (18Shen Z. Peterson S.R. Comeaux J.C. Zastrow D. Moyzis R.K. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) found that although N-terminal fragments of the protein self-associated in two-hybrid screens and affinity chromatography assays, fragments containing various portions of the C terminus, e.g. 287–418 or 166–418, did not. In contrast to these results, we find that RAD52-(218–418) is able to self-associate. Although our EM analysis revealed no distinct oligomeric structures for RAD52-(218–418), three different methods (STEM, gel filtration, and DLS) showed that this mutant formed oligomeric particles containing 3–4 subunits. These data for RAD52-(218–418), coupled with the inability of RAD52-(1–192) to form structures larger than the 10-nm rings, indicate that residues within the C-terminal region of the protein make important contributions to RAD52 self-association. Thus, the C-terminal region of RAD52 contains a novel self-association domain distinct from that previously identified within residues 65–165 (18Shen Z. Peterson S.R. Comeaux J.C. Zastrow D. Moyzis R.K. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Importantly, functional analyses of both the 1–192 and 218–418 mutant proteins show that each maintains an expected activity. Both wild-type RAD52 and the 1–192 proteins, which form ring-shaped oligomers, bound single-stranded DNA with similar affinities. This is consistent with previous studies that mapped the DNA binding domain of RAD52 to residues 39–80 2J. A. Lloyd, and K. L. Knight, unpublished data. (16Park M.S. Ludwig D.L. Stigger E. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18996-19000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The elevated affinity of RAD52-(1–192) for single-stranded DNA was noted also for a similar Rad52p construct (24Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Also as expected, RAD52-(218–418) showed a specific interaction with RPA. Again, this is consistent with previous studies that mapped the RPA interaction domain to residues 221–280 in RAD52 (16Park M.S. Ludwig D.L. Stigger E. Lee S.H. J. Biol.

The fact that both mutant proteins showed the expected functions demonstrates that they very likely maintain native structure, thereby supporting the relevance of differences observed in their oligomeric characteristics compared with wild-type RAD52. In summary, our data support a model in which the self-association domain within the N-terminal region of RAD52 (residues 1–192) promotes the formation of ring-shaped oligomers that are functional for DNA binding, whereas the C-terminal domain (residues 218–418) mediates higher order self-association events. Additionally, the protrusions extending from the 10-nm ring structure of wild-type RAD52, originally modeled by Stasiak et al. (21Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Dyck E.V.

Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and seen clearly in our electron micrographs, correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein. Given the likely importance of higher order self-association to the ability of RAD52 to promote end-to-end joining of DNA breaks (20Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), these protrusions seem to mediate a critically important aspect of RAD52 function. Further studies of various mutant RAD52 proteins will clarify the contribution made by the different aspects of self-association toward the overall function of this important DNA repair protein.

The peptide components of surfactant, in particular surfactant protein B (SP-B1) and SP-C, are critical for surfactant film formation and function. Newborn infants and mice lacking SP-B have dramatically reduced pulmonary compliance and develop lethal, respiratory distress syndrome shortly after birth (1Whitsett J.A. Nogee L.M. Weaver T.E. Horowitz A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 2Nogee L.M. BBA Mol. Basis Dis. 1998; 1408: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Disruption of the SP-B locus results in incomplete processing of pro-SP-C to its mature peptide, leading to deficiency of both SP-C and SP-B. SP-C null mice have normal levels of SP-B and survive with subtle changes in lung function but normal lung structure and surfactant pool sizes. 2S. Glasser, submitted for publication.2S. Glasser, submitted for publication. The importance of SP-C for normal lung function is inferred from experiments in which intratracheal administration of surfactant containing SP-C as the sole protein component to preterm animals restored lung function to values comparable with animals treated with native surfactant (3Hafner D. Beume R. Kilian U. Krasznai G. Lachmann B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Hawgood S. Ogawa A. Yukitake K. Schlueter M. Brown C. White T. Buckley D.

Care Med. 1998; 157: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that SP-C and SP-B are functionally interchangeable with respect to biophysical activity. SP-C is synthesized by the alveolar type II epithelial cell as a 197-amino acid proprotein in which the mature peptide (residues 24–58) is flanked by N-terminal (residues 1–23) and C-terminal (residues 59–197) peptide domains. Unlike SP-B, SP-C is an integral membrane protein, which contains a single membrane-spanning domain located within the mature peptide (6Johansson J. Szyperski T. Curstedt T. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6015-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The topology of the SP-C proprotein in the membrane is not clear, with reports of both type II (7Keller A. Eistetter H.R. Voss T. Schäfer K.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and type III (8Vorbroker D.K. Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L727-L733Google Scholar) orientations. SP-C proprotein is detected in endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and multivesicular bodies but not in lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage compartment for pulmonary surfactant (8Vorbroker D.K. Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L727-L733Google Scholar, 9Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Haagsman H.P. Geuze H.J. van Golde L.M.J. Microsc. Res. Technique. 1993; 26: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Processing of the proprotein results in cleavage of the propeptides and generation of the 35-amino acid mature peptide that is detected only in the multivesicular body and lamellar body (8Vorbroker D.K. Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L727-L733Google Scholar, 10Beers M.F. Lomax C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L744-L753Google Scholar). Colocalization of both proprotein and mature peptide in the multivesicular body strongly suggests that processing of the SP-C precursor to the biologically active peptide occurs within this compartment. In order to promote absorption and spreading of surfactant lipids at the alveolar air-liquid interface, mature SP-C peptide must be secreted by the type II cell. The mature peptide consists of an extremely hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a 10–12-amino acid extramembrane domain that contains palmitoylated cysteines at positions 5 and 6 (residues 28 and 29 of the proprotein) in most species (11Curstedt T.

J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L118-L125PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying secretion of this integral membrane peptide is not clear but probably involves two discrete steps. The proprotein is first sorted to the multivesicular body that ultimately fuses with the lamellar body, a lysosome-related organelle. Sorting of integral membrane proteins to lysosomes and secretory granules is dependent upon information encoded in the cytosolic domain of the protein (14Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 15Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), suggesting that either the N-terminal or C-terminal peptide domain of the proprotein plays an important role in sorting SP-C to lamellar bodies. Since SP-C mature peptide is detected only in the lumen of the lamellar body, a second step is required to relocate SP-C from the limiting membrane to the lumen of the multivesicular/lamellar body. It is likely that the N-terminal or C-terminal peptide domain also facilitates luminal internalization of SP-C. This study was designed to identify the compartment in which SP-C internalization occurs and the peptide domains required for sorting and secretion of SP-C into the airspace. Full-length human SP-C cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). To generate SP-C deletion constructs (Fig. 2 A), SP-C fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers to human SP-C containing 5′ SacI and 3′ SacII cleavage sites. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were subcloned into rEGFP vector (CLONTECH, San Jose, CA) and subjected to bidirectional sequencing to verify the fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction product throughout the SP-C coding sequence and the green fluorescent protein (GFP)/SP-C junction. PC12 cells (a gift from D. Cutler, University College London) were cultured as described previously (16Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S. Weaver T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19689-19695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in T25 flasks until 80% confluent and transiently transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNA and 60 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of culture, PC12 cells were labeled with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h. Cell lysates and media were immunoprecipitated exactly as described previously by Lin et al. (17Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. BBA Mol. Cell Res. 1996; 1312: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with 5 μl of an antibody directed against the SP-C N-terminal propeptide (18Vorbroker D.K. Profitt S.A. Nogee L.M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L647-L656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and autoradiography were performed as previously described (17Lin S. Phillips K.S. Wilder M.R. Weaver T.E. BBA Mol. Cell Res. 1996; 1312: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 106 PC12 cells were plated on laminin/polylysine-coated coverslips. After 24 h of culture, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h post-transfection, PC12 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, and stained with antibodies directed against the SP-C N-terminal propeptide (18Vorbroker D.K. Profitt S.A. Nogee L.M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L647-L656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and chromogranin A (1:100) (ICN Biomedical, Costa Mesa, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed and incubated with anti-rabbit Texas Red (1:100) and anti-mouse Cy5 secondary antibodies (1:400) (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. After cooling to 4 °C, nonpermeabilized cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with antibody directed against the SP-C N-terminal (18Vorbroker D.K. Profitt S.A. Nogee L.M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L647-L656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or C-terminal peptide domain (9Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Haagsman H.P. Geuze H.J. van Golde L.M.J. Microsc. Res.

Cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C. After 20 min, cells were washed and incubated with anti-rabbit Texas Red (1:100) and anti-biotin Cy5 secondary antibodies (1:400) (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at room temperature. All cells were washed with PBS and then double distilled H2O, mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence was imaged with a Leica confocal microscope and analyzed using Metamorph Imaging Software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Type II cells were prepared from 6-week old female C57B/6 mice as described by Cortiet al. (19Corti M. Brody A.R. Harrison J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A crude cell suspension was prepared by rapid instillation of 3 ml of Dispase into the lung followed immediately by 0.5 ml of 1% low melting temperature agarose, warmed to 45 °C. Single cell suspensions were subsequently isolated as previously described (19Corti M. Brody A.R. Harrison J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and added to 100-mm culture dishes coated with 42 μg of CD45 and 16 μg of CD32 antibodies (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in 6 ml of PBS followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were gently “panned” to free settled type II cells and pelleted at 130 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. Type II cells were resuspended in culture media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin), plated at a density of 3 × 106 cells/well, and allowed to attach to collagen-coated 22 × 22 coverslips for 4 h. Cells were washed with calcium-free Hanks' balanced salt buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected with a hand-held gene gun (Bio-Rad) at 100 p.s.i. with GFP/SP-C24–58 plasmid-coated 0.6 μm gold particles. Culture medium was replaced, and cells were cultured for 24 h followed by immunostaining with antibody directed against mature SP-C as described above. The sequence encoding amino acids 24–58 or 1–58 was amplified from cDNA generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of type II cell RNA isolated from C57B/6 mice using specific primers that included a Kozak consensus sequence in the 5′ primer and a hemagglutinin tag (YPYDVPDYA) in the 3′ primer. The SP-C1–33PDGFR531–553HA adenoviral construct was generated by using overlapping primers to include the SP-C cytosolic domain (residues 1–33 of the proprotein), the PDGFR transmembrane domain (residues 531–53), and an HA tag. These polymerase chain reaction fragments were cloned into the Adv2 adenoviral shuttle vector (20Davis A.R. Meyers K. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and sequenced bidirectionally to confirm the integrity of the reading frame. Recombination and virus production were performed as described previously (20Davis A.R. Meyers K. Wilson J.M. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purified adenoviral particles were intratracheally injected into wild type Swiss Black and SP-C (−/−) mice (Stephan Glasser, Cincinnati, OH). Mice were anesthetized and injected with 2 × 109 plaque-forming units of adenovirus/mouse in Hanks' balanced salt buffer containing 12 mm EGTA (21Wang G. Zabner J. Deering C. Launspach J. Shao J. Bodner M. Jolly D.J. Davidson B.L. McCray P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 100 μl. Three or four days after infection, lung tissue was fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% gluteraldehyde, and the fixed, cryoprotected frozen tissue was processed for immunogold labeling with HA antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as described previously (9Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Haagsman H.P. Geuze H.J. van Golde L.M.J. Microsc. Res. Technique. 1993; 26: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Injected mice were lavaged with saline (5 × 1 ml), and surfactant was isolated by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Bronchoalveolar lavage from three injected mice was pooled, and large and small aggregate fractions were isolated on a 0.8 m sucrose gradient as described previously (22Ikegami M. Ueda T. Hull W. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Dranoff G. Jobe A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L650-L658Google Scholar). Lamellar bodies were isolated from pooled lungs of three injected mice as previously described by Osanai et al. (23Osanai K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein, determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18497) Google Scholar), from large and small aggregate fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with an antibody directed against the HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). This study was designed to identify the peptide domain(s) that directs sorting and secretion of SP-C. Because isolated type II cells are very difficult to transfect, initial sorting studies were performed in transiently transfected PC12 cells. PC12 cells were transfected with wild type SP-C1–197 and labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine, and cell lysates and media were immunoprecipitated. SP-C proprotein (Mr = 21,000) was detected in cell lysates but was not processed to the active peptide (Mr = 4000) or secreted into the media (Fig.1 A). To determine if wild type SP-C1–197 was sorted to the regulated secretory pathway, PC12 cells were transfected with SP-C1–197 and stained with antibodies directed against the SP-C proprotein and chromogranin A, a marker for dense core granules. Wild type SP-C1–197 proprotein colocalized with chromogranin A consistent with sorting to the regulated secretory pathway (Fig.1 B, upper panel). These results, coupled with previous reports that SP-C is an integral membrane protein (7Keller A. Eistetter H.R. Voss T. Schäfer K.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Keller A. Stienhilber W. Schäfer K.P. Voss T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggested that the proprotein was located in the limiting membrane of the dense core granule and that exocytosis would lead to localization of SP-C on the cell surface. To test this hypothesis, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with wild type SP-C1–197 and stained with an antibody directed against the N-terminal or C-terminal peptide domains and wheat germ agglutinin lectin to define the cell surface. In nonpermeabilized cells, SP-C immunoreactivity was detected with antibody directed against the C-terminal peptide, consistent with an extracellular location for this peptide domain (Fig. 1 B). The N-terminal propeptide was detected only after cell permeabilization, confirming that this peptide domain is located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B). Collectively, these data suggest that SP-C is a type II integral membrane protein and that sorting to the regulated secretory pathway occurs independently of proprotein processing. To determine the minimal peptide sequence required for sorting of the SP-C proprotein to the regulated secretory pathway, a series of deletion constructs (Fig. 2 A) were cloned in frame with GFP, transfected into PC12 cells, and analyzed for colocalization with chromogranin A. All deletion constructs, including a construct consisting of only the mature SP-C peptide (SPC24–58), colocalized with chromogranin A (Fig.2 B); further, SP-C was sorted to the regulated secretory pathway irrespective of the position of GFP at the N- or C terminus of the mature SP-C peptide (data not shown). SPC24–58contains two candidate-sorting motifs, a dileucine motif at positions 31 and 32 (residues 54 and 55 of the proprotein) and two palmitoylated cysteines at positions 5 and 6 (residues 28 and 29 of the proprotein). The sorting activity of the dileucine motif was tested by deleting the last 5 residues of the mature peptide (SP-C24–53); the sorting activity of the palmitoylated cysteines was tested by mutating both cysteine residues to serine or alanine (SP-CCC→SSand SP-CCC→AA) in the context of the proprotein (Fig.2 A). The proteins encoded by all of these constructs colocalized with chromogranin A following transfection of PC12 cells, indicating that neither motif is involved in SP-C sorting (data not shown). We conclude from these experiments that the N- and C-terminal peptide domains of SP-C are not required for sorting to the regulated secretory pathway of PC12 cells and that a novel sorting motif is located in the 10-residue extramembrane, cytosolic domain of the mature peptide (residues 24 and 33 of the proprotein). The results in PC12 cells predicted that the mature SP-C peptide (SP-C24–58) would be sorted to lamellar bodies in type II cells. This hypothesis was tested by transfecting freshly isolated mouse type II cells with a construct encoding the mature SP-C peptide (GFP/SP-C24–58). The plasmid was precipitated onto gold particles and propelled into type II cells with a hand-held gene gun (Bio-Rad). Following 24 h of culture, GFP fluorescence was detected in vesicular structures that also stained positively for the mature SP-B peptide (Fig. 3). Since SP-B mature peptide is only detected in multivesicular bodies and lamellar bodies of type II cells (26Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Haagsman H.P. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. van Golde L.M.G. Geuze H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L479-L486PubMed Google Scholar), these results confirm that the mature SP-C peptide is sorted to the secretory pathway in the absence of the flanking N- and C-terminal peptide domains. To determine if SP-C mature peptide could be sorted to lamellar bodiesin vivo, an adenoviral construct encoding SP-C mature peptide with a hemagglutinin tag (SP-C24–58HA) was generated for intratracheal injection into adult mice. The subcellular distribution of SP-C24–58HA in infected mice was analyzed by immunogold labeling of fixed, cryoprotected frozen lung sections. Gold particles were detected throughout the regulated secretory pathway including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, multivesicular bodies, and lamellar bodies, but not in the nucleus, mitochondria, or plasma membrane (Fig. 4, B andC). Within multivesicular bodies, HA labeling was detected on the limiting membrane and the inner vesicles (Fig. 4 B) similar to the distribution of SP-C proprotein in wild type (data not shown) and SP-B null mice (Fig. 4 A). Localization of SP-C on the inner vesicles of multivesicular bodies suggested that SP-C24–58HA could be secreted. To determine if the cytosolic domain of the mature SP-C peptide (residues 1–10) was sufficient to direct secretion of SP-C, mice were intratracheally injected with SP-C24–58HA adenovirus. Four days postinfection, mice were lavaged, and the surfactant pellet was isolated. SP-C24–58HA was detected in the surfactant pellet of all seven infected mice, consistent with secretion of the peptide into the airway (Fig.5 A). Fractionation of BAL into large and small aggregates revealed that SP-C24–58HA co-sedimented with wild type mature SP-B in the surface-active, large aggregate fraction (Fig. 5 B). Immunohistochemical analyses of the lungs from injected mice detected HA staining in epithelial cells and in the alveolar spaces without any evidence of cytotoxicity; further, when mice were infected with adenovirus encoding luciferase, reporter activity was not detected in BAL (data not shown). These data indicate that SP-C mature peptide is secreted into the alveolar space and associates with the large aggregate surfactant fraction. To determine if SP-C24–58HA could be secreted in the absence of endogenous SP-C, SP-C knockout mice were intratracheally injected with SP-C24–58HA adenovirus. Four days after infection, mice were lavaged, and large and small aggregate fractions were isolated. SP-C24–58HA was detected in the large aggregate fraction of wild type but not SP-C null mice (Fig.6 A). To determine if SP-C24–58HA was sorted to lamellar bodies in the absence of endogenous SP-C, lamellar bodies from lung homogenates were isolated from infected wild type and SP-C knockout mice. SP-C24–58HA was detected in lamellar body fractions of wild type mice but not SP-C (−/−) (Fig. 6 B). We conclude from these experiments that, in the absence of endogenous SP-C, the cytosolic domain of the mature peptide is not sufficient to sort SP-C to the regulated secretory pathway in type II cells. To test the hypothesis that the N-terminal propeptide of SP-C could direct sorting and secretion of SP-C24–58 in SP-C (−/−) mice, an adenovirus encoding the SP-C N-terminal propeptide and mature peptide (SP-C1–58HA) was generated. Three days after infection, SP-C (−/−) mice were lavaged, and the large aggregate fraction was isolated. Western analysis detected SP-C1–58HA in the large aggregate surfactant fraction that also contained mature SP-B peptide (Fig.7). SP-C1–58HA comigrated with SP-C24–58HA in wild type mice, consistent with cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide. The results of these experiments indicate that the N-terminal propeptide is required for secretion of SP-C. To determine if the cytosolic domain of SP-C could direct sorting and secretion of a heterologous transmembrane domain, an adenoviral construct consisting of the SP-C cytosolic domain (residues 1–33), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) transmembrane domain (residues 531–553), and the 9-amino acid HA tag (SPC1–33PDGFR531–553HA) was generated. Three days after infection, SP-C (−/−) mice were lavaged, and the large aggregate fraction isolated; in addition, lamellar body fractions were isolated from lung tissue. SPC1–33PDGFR531–553HA was detected in both large aggregate and lamellar body fractions (Fig.8); however, SPC1–33PDGFR531–553HA did not comigrate with SP-C1–58HA, suggesting that the N-terminal propeptide was not cleaved from the chimeric protein. These results demonstrate that the cytosolic domain of the SP-C proprotein can direct the sorting and secretion of a heterologous transmembrane domain but is not sufficient to direct processing of the propeptide. SP-C is an integral membrane protein that is sorted to the lamellar body and subsequently secreted with surfactant lipids into the alveolar space. The current study was undertaken to identify the peptide domain(s) involved in the sorting of SP-C to the regulated secretory pathway in type II cells and secretion of this integral membrane protein. In the presence of endogenous SP-C, the mature peptide was sorted to the regulated secretory pathway and was secreted into the airspace. However, in the absence of endogenous SP-C, the SP-C N-terminal propeptide was required for secretion of the mature peptide. The importance of the cytosolic domain for secretion of SP-C was confirmed by demonstrating that residues 1–33 of the proprotein was sufficient to direct secretion of a truncated PDGFR receptor. Integral membrane proteins are sorted to specific subcellular compartments based on information encoded in the cytosolic domain of the protein (14Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 15Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified the SP-C proprotein as a type III integral membrane protein (8Vorbroker D.K. Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L727-L733Google Scholar), in which the C-terminal propeptide is located in the cytoplasm, or a type II membrane integral membrane protein (7Keller A. Eistetter H.R. Voss T. Schäfer K.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in which the N-terminal propeptide is cytosolic. The results of the current study in PC12 cells suggest a type II membrane orientation consistent with the results reported by Keller et al. (7Keller A. Eistetter H.R. Voss T. Schäfer K.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This conclusion is also consistent with the presence of a putative stop-transfer sequence (amino acids 34 and 35 of the proprotein) and the palmitoylation of adjacent cysteine residues (amino acids 28 and 29 of the proprotein), motifs that frequently occur on the cytosolic side of the membrane (27Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar,28Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Further evidence comes from immunogold labeling studies that detected the N-terminal propeptide inside the internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies, consistent with a type II orientation (8Vorbroker D.K. Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L727-L733Google Scholar, 9Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Haagsman H.P. Geuze H.J. van Golde L.M.J. Microsc. Res. Technique. 1993; 26: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the cytosolic domain of SP-C is composed of the 23-amino acid N-terminal propeptide and the first 10 amino acids of the mature peptide. Consistent with a cytosolic location for the N-terminal propeptide, deletion of the entire 139-amino acid C-terminal propeptide of the SP-C proprotein did not perturb sorting to the regulated secretory pathway in PC12 cells. Moreover, removal of the last 5 amino acids of the mature peptide (residues 54–58 of the proprotein), which contains a dileucine motif at positions 54 and 55, did not affect SP-C sorting. SP-C was also sorted following the deletion of the 23-amino acid N-terminal propeptide, suggesting that the 10-amino acid cytosolic domain of the mature peptide (residues 24–33 of the proprotein) is sufficient to direct SP-C to the regulated secretory pathway. This outcome is difficult to reconcile with results of previous studies suggesting that the C-terminal propeptide of the proprotein was critical for intracellular trafficking of SP-C (25Keller A. Stienhilber W. Schäfer K.P. Voss T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Beers M.F. Lomax C.A. Russo S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15287-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is possible that selected mutations/deletions within the C-terminal peptide resulted in misfolding and degradation of SP-C in a cytosolic compartment; for example, in previous studies, a potential intramolecular sulfhydryl bridge was disrupted by deletion of cysteine 189 and/or cysteine 121, residues that are strictly conserved in the SP-C proprotein of all seven species analyzed to date (25Keller A. Stienhilber W. Schäfer K.P. Voss T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Beers M.F. Lomax C.A. Russo S.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 277: L1034-L1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interpretation of the latter studies is further complicated by expression of SP-C deletion constructs in cell types that lack a typical regulated secretory pathway. PC12 cells used in this study have a well characterized regulated secretory pathway and have been used extensively for sorting and secretion studies (31Stahlman M.T. Gray M.E. Ross G.F. Hull W.M.

We have previously used PC12 cells to identify a sorting determinant in the SP-B proprotein and confirmed the identity of the sorting signal in transgenic mice (16Lin S. Akinbi H.T. Breslin J.S.

Cell Res. 1996; 1312: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the current study, the results of experiments in PC12 cells were confirmed by transfecting isolated type II cells and by intratracheal injection of wild type mice with adenovirus encoding the mature peptide. In both cases, SP-C mature peptide (SP-C24–58HA) was detected in lamellar bodies, consistent with sorting of the mature peptide to this compartment in the absence of the N- and C-terminal peptide domains. Interestingly, SP-C was not detected in lamellar bodies or BAL of SP-C (−/−) mice infected with adenovirus encoding SP-C24–58HA. This outcome suggests that in wild type mice endogenous SP-C associated with transfected mature SP-C peptide to facilitate its trafficking to lamellar bodies; SP-C mature peptide may similarly interact with an endogenous protein(s) in PC12 cells, leading to localization in dense core secretory granules. The sorting deficit in SP-C (−/−) mice was corrected by the addition of the 23-amino acid N-terminal propeptide to SP-C24–58. SP-C1–58HA was processed to the mature peptide consistent with trafficking through the multivesicular body, a compartment previously shown to be involved in processing of the SP-C and SP-B proproteins (8Vorbroker D.K. Voorhout W.F. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L727-L733Google Scholar, 10Beers M.F. Lomax C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 13: L744-L753Google Scholar, 26Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T.

Physiol. 1992; 263: L479-L486PubMed Google Scholar); further, the processed peptide was detected in the extracellular, surface-active, large aggregate fraction of surfactant. Collectively, these studies suggest that the N-terminal propeptide is required for efficient sorting of SP-C to the distal secretory pathway in type II cells and that sorting occurs independently of the C-terminal peptide. Furthermore, the cytosolic domain of SP-C was able to direct both the sorting (to lamellar bodies) and secretion of the transmembrane domain of PDGFR. However, SPC1–33PDGFR531–553HA was not efficiently processed to a smaller form, suggesting that the SP-C transmembrane domain may contribute to the formation of an optimal cleavage site between the propeptide and mature peptide. Sorting of SP-C to the distal secretory pathway is necessary but not sufficient for secretion of SP-C into the alveolar space. In transfected PC12 cells, SP-C was detected in the limiting membrane of dense core granules and was transferred to the plasma membrane during exocytosis; however, in type II epithelial cells, SP-C was detected in the lumen of the lamellar body and was secreted with surfactant phospholipids. These observations suggest that the SP-C proprotein is relocated from the limiting membrane of a transport or storage vesicle to the vesicle lumen during transit in the secretory pathway of the type II cell. Ultrastructural analyses detected SP-C proprotein in the limiting membrane and luminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies, suggesting a key role for this compartment in SP-C secretion. Relocation of SP-C within the multivesicular body is probably the result of inward vesiculation of the limiting membrane, similar to the process leading to internalization and subsequent degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in lysosomes (36Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 37Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Inward vesiculation of the multivesicular body-limiting membrane is probably dependent on the interaction of specific residues in the cytosolic domain of the SP-C proprotein with unidentified cytoplasmic proteins. Not all proteins on the limiting membrane of the multivesicular body are included in the inner vesicles (39Denzer K. Weber B. HilleRehfeld A. vonFigura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Escola J.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Stoorvogel W. Griffith J.M. Yoshie O. Geuze H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20121-20127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), suggesting that SP-C is selectively sorted to the inner vesicle. The finding that SP-C1–58HA is secreted following infection of SP-C (−/−) mice suggests that residues 1–34 of the proprotein contain one of more motifs that direct sorting to the secretory pathway and internalization of SP-C into the luminal vesicles of the multivesicular bodies. Following internal vesicle formation, the multivesicular body fuses with the lamellar body, resulting in the incorporation of the internal vesicles of the multivesicular body into the internal membranes of the lamellar body and, ultimately, secretion of SP-C with surfactant phospholipids (41Stahlman M.T. Gray M.P. Falconieri M.W. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 42Sorokin S.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1967; 14: 884-897Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In summary, the mature SP-C peptide is sorted to the regulated secretory pathway of PC12 cells, isolated mouse type II cells, and adenovirus-infected wild type mice; however, mature SP-C peptide was not sorted to lamellar bodies or secreted into the airway of adenovirus-infected SP-C (−/−) mice. The addition of the SP-C N-terminal propeptide to the mature peptide (SP-C1–58HA) restored sorting, processing, and secretion of SP-C as part of a functional surfactant complex; further, the cytosolic domain of SP-C was sufficient to direct the sorting and secretion of a heterologous transmembrane domain. These studies demonstrate that the N-terminal propeptide of SP-C is critical for the intracellular trafficking and secretion of SP-C in type II cells."

Although animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that perturbations in iron status and metabolism alter folate metabolism, the biochemical mechanisms underlying these associations have yet to be identified. The effect of altered ferritin expression on folate metabolism was determined in human MCF-7 cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. Cells expressing rat heavy chain ferritin (HCF) exhibited markedly increased expression of the folate-dependent enzyme cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT). These effects were not seen when rat light chain ferritin was expressed. Additionally, cSHMT expression was not altered when HCF expression was induced in MCF-7 cells cultured with supplemental ferric citrate. This indicates that cSHMT expression is increased by elevated HCF concentrations, independent of increased iron availability, suggesting that cSHMT expression may respond to HCF-induced chelation of the regulatory iron pool. Increased HCF expression did not alter cSHMT mRNA levels, but did increase translation rates of cSHMT mRNA. The increase in translation was mediated, at least in part, through the cSHMT 5′-untranslated region of the transcript. MCF-7 cells with increased expression of cSHMT displayed increased efficiency of de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, indicating that thymidylate synthesis is normally limited by cSHMT activity in MCF-7 cells. Our data suggest that the iron regulatory pool may play an important role in regulating folate metabolism and thereby thymidine biosynthesis.

Iron deficiency can influence folate status, modify folate metabolism, and result in hematological pathologies similar to those normally attributed to folate deficiency (1Westerman D. Evans D. Metz J. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is not certain if all observed effects of iron deficiency on folate status reflect actual changes in intracellular folate concentrations or are due to alterations in folate-dependent metabolism. Studies of iron-deficient rats have demonstrated a 90% decrease in serum folate levels compared with their iron-sufficient controls (2Toskes P. Smith G. Giannella R. Bensinger T. Conrad M. Gastroenterology. 1972; 62: 861Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The decreased serum folate is not secondary to intestinal malabsorption, changes in intestinal flora, isolated folate malabsorption, or changes in vitamin B12 status. In addition, maternal iron deficiency in rats decreases the secretion of folate into milk (3O'Connor D. Picciano M. Tamura T. Shane B. J.

Many of the findings in rats have been replicated in other mammals and in pregnant and non-pregnant humans (2Toskes P. Smith G. Giannella R. Bensinger T. Conrad M.

In humans, iron deficiency impairs folate utilization in certain tissues, decreases polyglutamation levels of folate, decreases the secretion of folate into breast milk without decreasing maternal folate stores, and can cause granulocyte abnormalities characteristic of folate deficiencies (1Westerman D.

Despite the numerous clinical associations, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the influence of iron deficiency on folate metabolism have not been established (3O'Connor D. Picciano M. Tamura T.

Herbert V. Colman N. Longo D. Br. J. Haematol. 1978; 39: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The regulation of iron status and intracellular iron concentrations is complex. Cellular iron can be categorized into three pools: the functional, storage, and regulatory pools (14Harrison P. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). The functional iron pool refers to the iron incorporated into proteins that require the mineral for enzymatic function or structural integrity, including hemoglobin and ribonucleotide reductase. The storage iron pool refers to iron that is associated with the iron storage protein ferritin (14Harrison P. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Finally, the regulatory iron pool is the iron that is in equilibrium with the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs).1 It is this pool of iron that is therefore critical for the translational regulation of mRNA species that contain iron regulatory elements, including ferritin and transferrin receptor transcripts (15Thomson A. Rogers J. Leedman P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). When the regulatory iron pool is decreased, IRPs bind to these mRNA elements and inhibit specific mRNA translation or degradation (15Thomson A. Rogers J. Leedman P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the cell, iron is an effective and deleterious oxidizing agent. The cell prevents iron-mediated oxidative damage by chelating and storing intracellular iron within the protein complex that is ferritin. Ferritin is a heterogeneous protein composed of heavy chain (HCF) and light chain (LCF) subunits (16Arosio C. Fossati L. Vigano M. Trombini P. Cazzaniga G. Poperno A. Haematologica. 1999; 84: 560-576PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, HCF and LCF share 54% sequence identity and assemble in varying proportions to make up a complex of 24 subunits (14Harrison P. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). The ratio of heavy to light isomers varies depending on cell type and function (17Munro H. Linder M. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 58: 318-387Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The heavy chain isomer has the capacity to sequester iron through its ferroxidase active sites, whereas LCF is believed to function in mineralizing iron at the core of the ferritin polymer (18Levi S. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Cozzi A. Franceschinelli F. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18086-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased HCF expression can be induced in cell culture models, resulting in chelation and subsequent lowering of the regulatory iron pool (19Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas elevations in LCF levelsin vivo have no effect on the regulatory iron pool (20Kwak E. Larochelle D. Beaumont C. Torti S. Torti F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Current literature indicates that changes in the ferritin subunit ratio generally result from transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding HCF. Hormones and other factors, including c-Myc, estrogen, and pro-inflammatory cytokines during infections, can specifically increase HCF transcription (21Wu C. Habib N. Mitry R. Reitsma P. van Deventer S. Chamuleau R. Int. J. Oncol. 1997; 11: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar, 22Holland L. Wall A. Bhattacharya A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Smirnov I. Bailey K. Flowers C. Garrigues N. Wesselius L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L257-L263PubMed Google Scholar). Sequestration of intracellular iron from all iron pools can be achieved using chemical iron chelators such as deferoxamine and mimosine. These chelators have been shown to reduce iron incorporation into ferritin (24Brady M. Lilley K. Treffry A. Harrison P. Hider R. Taylor P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1989; 35: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that chemical chelators can alter folate metabolism in a tissue-specific manner by modifying the expression of the folate-dependent enzyme cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) (25Oppenheim E. Nasrallah I. Mastri M. Stover P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that iron sequestration may play a regulatory role in folate metabolism by inhibiting cSHMT transcription. The effect of iron chelators on cSHMT transcription appears to be novel and unrelated to known mechanisms through which iron regulates gene expression (25Oppenheim E. Nasrallah I. Mastri M. Stover P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The SHMT enzyme catalyzes the tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent interconversion of glycine and serine (Scheme FS1). This reaction is the primary source of folate-activated one-carbon units. There are three biosynthetic pathways that are associated with cytoplasmic folate metabolism and that require folate-activated one-carbon units: purine biosynthesis, which requires the 10-formyl-THF cofactor; thymidine biosynthesis, which requires 5,10-methylene-THF; and methionine synthesis (homocysteine remethylation), which requires 5-methyl-THF (26Appling D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). There are two intracellular isoforms of SHMT, one located in the mitochondria and the other in the cytoplasm. Mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that the mitochondrial isozyme is essential for the generation of glycine and presumably formate (Scheme FS1). Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking mitochondrial SHMT activity are auxotrophic for glycine (27Pfender W. Pizer L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that cSHMT activity cannot replace mitochondrial SHMT function. The inability of cSHMT to compensate for the loss of mitochondrial SHMT function indicates that the cSHMT isozyme is not a primary source of glycine and perhaps one-carbon units. The SHMT-catalyzed reaction is freely reversible in vitro using physiological concentrations of amino acid and folate substrates (28Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Schirch V. Strong W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enzyme, when catalyzing serine degradation, can supply 5,10-methylene-THF for biosynthetic reactions; and when catalyzing serine synthesis, it can deplete 5,10-methylene-THF pools and regenerate THF for purine biosynthesis. Consequently, cSHMT is poised to regulate the supply of folate-activated one-carbon units for both DNA synthesis and methionine regeneration. The ability of iron chelators to influence cSHMT expression may begin to provide a mechanistic rationale for the known associations between iron and folate metabolism. The cSHMT enzyme is potentially critical for regulating folate metabolism because of its capacity to regulate the flux of folate substrates, and cSHMT is known to be sensitive to extreme alterations in intracellular iron concentrations as those induced by chemical chelators (25Oppenheim E. Nasrallah I. Mastri M. Stover P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the use of chemical iron chelators to mimic iron deficiency is not an adequate model to test the physiological relevance of cSHMT regulation by iron. Therefore, in this study, we examined the ability of the endogenous iron chelator HCF to influence cSHMT expression and activity in cell culture models. Human MCF-7 mammary adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC HTB22) and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, a subline of the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, have been previously described (28Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J.

Cells were cultured with α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM; Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 11% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. MCF-7 cells were cultured in 100-mm culture dishes with α-MEM and grown to 80% confluency. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 × 107 cells were incubated on ice for 10 min before 10 μg of plasmid DNA was added. The cells were electroporated at 0.22 kV and 950 microfarads (using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser). Cells were cultured with α-MEM for 48 h and then cultured with G418 sulfate (500 μg/ml)-supplemented α-MEM to select for stable integrants. The plasmid (pcDNA3 vector, Invitrogen) contained the open reading frame cDNA for either rat HCF or LCF (30Suh J. Oppenheim E. Gigis S. Stover P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Over 10 colonies were isolated and passaged until stable lines were generated. The antisense cSHMT construct was generated by transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total mRNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells (PurgeneTM RNA isolation kit) and converted to cDNA using Tth polymerase (Promega) and random hexamer primers. The first 405 base pairs (bp) of the human cSHMT cDNA were amplified using forward primer 5′-TTCATGAATTCGGGTCAGCGGGTCTGGGACTGGTGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACTAAGGATCCTCAAATCACTGTCTTTGAGGG-3′. The forward primer contains an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end, whereas the reverse primer contains a BamHI restriction site. The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 70 °C for 90 s for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector described above. The sequence was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Once verified, the construct was transfected into MCF-7 cells. Stable cell lines expressing the antisense construct were also generated by the procedure described above. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min in buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8). Cellular proteins (40–120 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using 10–12% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred at 4 °C to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore Corp.) using a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, membranes were incubated with primary antiserum for 15 h at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated for 4–15 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Rat ferritin (Sigma) was used as a standard for all ferritin Western blot analyses, and recombinant human cSHMT was used as a standard for cSHMT Western blot analyses. The membranes were visualized using the horseradish peroxidase SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce). For detection of HCF, sheep anti-human HCF antiserum (30Suh J. Oppenheim E. Gigis S. Stover P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:8000, and the secondary antibody (rabbit anti-sheep IgG, Pierce) was diluted 1:6500. For LCF detection, rabbit anti-rat LCF antiserum (30Suh J. Oppenheim E. Gigis S. Stover P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:8000, and the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, Pierce) was diluted 1:5000. For thymidylate synthase detection, monoclonal mouse anti-human thymidylate synthase antiserum (NeoMarkers) was diluted 1:1000, and the anti-mouse goat IgG secondary antibody was diluted 1:3500. For cSHMT detection, sheep anti-human cSHMT antiserum (31Girgis S. Nasrallah I. Suh J.R. Oppenheim E. Zanetti K. Mastri M. Stover P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 210: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:7500, and rabbit anti-sheep IgG antiserum was diluted 1:6500. Cells were grown for 24 h in medium enriched with 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 μm ferric citrate. Two replicate plates were grown at each supplementation concentration. Cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C until Western blot analyses were conducted. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells using RNAzolTM(Teltest, Inc.) and converted to cDNA using a first strand synthesis kit (CLONTECH). A competitive RT-PCR method based on the MIMIC strategy (CLONTECH) was used to measure cSHMT mRNA levels. A competitive internal standard with the same primer-binding sites used to amplify the 300-bp segment of the cSHMT cDNA was generated by amplifying 500 bp of v-erbB using two composite primers (40-mers), 5′-GAACACTGCCATGTGGTGACCCGCAAGTGAAATCTCCTCCG-3′ and 5′-CTTCAGTGCCACAGCAACCAAGTTGAGTCCATGGGGAGCTTT-3′. The first 20 nucleotides of the 40-mer are complementary to cSHMT, whereas the following 20 nucleotides are complementary to v-erbB. The 540-bp internal standard was synthesized and purified following protocols described by the manufacturer. The primers used to amplify cSHMT cDNA and the internal standard were 5′-GAACACTGCCATGTGGTGACC-3′ and 5′-CTTCAGTGCCACAGCAACC-3′. The primer-binding sites are located in cSHMT exons 8 and 9, thereby avoiding possible genomic DNA contamination. The primers used to create the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standard were 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACCGCAAGTGAAATCTCCTCCG-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTATTGAGTCCATGGGGAGCTTT-3′, and the primers used to amplify glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ and 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′. To perform the RT-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA, and the v-erbB internal standard was added at several concentrations varying by 2-fold over the range until a target/standard ratio of 1.0 was achieved (1 × 10−3 to 1 × 10−7 amol/reaction). Target cDNA and the internal standard were amplified with Taq polymerase. The cycling parameters were 94 °C for 45 s, 65 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for 28 cycles. Internal standard and target DNA fragments were then separated on a 1.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide solutions. DNA concentrations and cSHMT message copy number were quantified using a ChemiImager 4400 with AlphaEase Version 4.0 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). As described previously, both the full-length and shorter alternatively spliced form of the cSHMT 5′-untranslated region (UTR) were cloned into the pGL3-luciferase promoter vector (Promega) such that the cSHMT 5′-UTR was fused to the luciferase open reading frame just as it is normally fused to the cSHMT open reading frame (31Girgis S. Nasrallah I. Suh J.R. Oppenheim E. Zanetti K. Mastri M. Stover P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 210: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Liu X. Reig B. Nasrallah I. Stover P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11523-11531Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The LUTR-luc (where LUTR is the long 332-bp UTR and luc is luciferase) construct encodes the full-length cSHMT UTR fused to the luciferase open reading frame, whereas the SUTR-luc (where SUTR is the short 193-bp UTR) construct encodes the shorter alternatively spliced cSHMT 5′-UTR fused to the luciferase open reading frame. The constructs were transfected with a control construct for transfection efficiency (pRL-CMV vector, Promega) into MCF-7 and rat HCF-expressing MCF-7 cells. The transfection method has been described previously (25Oppenheim E. Nasrallah I. Mastri M. Stover P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 48 h following transfection, the cells were assayed for luciferase activity. The activity generated from all constructs was normalized to that generated from the co-reporter pRL-CMV-Renilla luciferase. The luciferase activities generated from the LUTR-luc and SUTR-luc constructs were normalized to luciferase activity generated from the same construct lacking the cSHMT 5′-UTR in the same cell lines to control for differences in basal translation rates among cell lines. All reported luciferase activity values represent the mean of at least five measurements, and the error bars represent the S.E. values. RNAs corresponding to luciferase mRNA, luciferase mRNA with the cSHMT 5′-UTR fusion (Lluc-mRNA), and luciferase mRNA with the shortened alternatively spliced cSHMT 5′-UTR fusion (Sluc-mRNA) were generated using the Ribomax large-scale RNA production system/T7 kit (Promega) as described previously (32Liu X. Reig B. Nasrallah I. Stover P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11523-11531Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The crude mRNA was treated with DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C and precipitated overnight in 2m LiCl at 4 °C. All RNA procedures were conducted under RNase-free conditions, and purity was verified by electrophoresis. The translation reaction mixture containing rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 1 mm MgOAc, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 35 mm KCl (Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate system kit,Promega) was incubated at 37 °C for 35 min with luciferase mRNA, Lluc-mRNA, or Sluc-mRNA templates. All experiments were performed at a final mRNA concentration of 0.2 μg/ml to ensure that the catalytic system was below saturation. The mRNA templates were heated to 65 °C for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature before addition to the reaction mixture to allow for a more uniform secondary structure to form. All enzyme/mRNA incubations contained RNase inhibitor (Ambion Inc.). To determine the effects of rat ferritin and ferric citrate on cSHMT translation, varying concentrations of rat ferritin or ferric ammonium citrate were added to the reaction mixture. Following a 35-min incubation at 30 °C, the translation reaction mixtures were quenched on ice, and the luciferase activity was determined. Cells were plated to a confluence of 1 × 106 cells/24-mm well and cultured overnight with α-MEM. The medium was changed to 3 ml of defined medium, which lacked ribonucleosides, deoxyribonucleosides, thymidine, hypoxanthine, serine, and glycine. After 48 h, the medium was refreshed, and deoxyuridine was added to a final concentration of 50 μm in experimental samples, but was excluded from control wells. After a 90-min incubation, 5 μl of [3H]thymidine (1 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to all wells. After a 24-h incubation, cells were harvested, and DNA was isolated (PurgeneTM DNA purification kit). Once isolated and rehydrated, DNA concentrations were determined atA260. DNA solutions were transferred to scintillation tubes, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined using a scintillation counter to determine cpm/μg of DNA. Data are expressed as cpm/μg of DNA in control samples (lacking deoxyuridine) divided by cpm/μg of DNA in experimental samples (supplemented with deoxyuridine).

The effect of iron chelation on cSHMT expression is cell-specific; cSHMT protein levels are not affected by iron chelators in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. To determine if cSHMT expression was responsive to changes in the cellular iron regulatory pool, the effects of rat HCF and LCF expression on cellular cSHMT protein concentrations were determined in MCF-7 and SH-SY5Y cells. Others have shown that increased expression of HCF, but not LCF, in mammalian cells decreases the cellular concentration of free non-ferritin bound iron (19Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.

In our study, both MCF-7 and SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with a plasmid that expresses either rat HCF or LCF cDNA, and stable clones were isolated. Clonal lines were screened for changes in HCF, LCF, and cSHMT protein levels (Figs.1 and 2).Figure 2Effects of LCF expression on cSHMT protein levels. LCF (A) and cSHMT (B) protein levels were determined in MCF-7 cells and cell lines expressing the rat LCF cDNA. Crude cellular protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and LCF and cSHMT protein levels were determined by Western blot analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1 shows the effects of expressing rat HCF cDNA on cSHMT protein levels in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma (A) and MCF-7 cells (B) as determined by Western blotting. The upper panels verify that HCF protein levels were increased in both G418-resistant MCF-7 and SH-SY5Y cell lines. Surprisingly, we found that cSHMT protein levels were also elevated 5–10-fold in all HCF-expressing MCF-7 cell lines, indicating that increased rat HCF expression has the opposite effect of chemical chelators on cSHMT protein concentrations. This effect on cSHMT protein concentrations was also seen in all SH-SY5Y clonal cell lines. This indicates that, unlike the effects of iron chelators on cSHMT expression (25Oppenheim E. Nasrallah I. Mastri M. Stover P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19268-19274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the effects of HCF are not cell-specific for MCF-7 cells since both cell lines had increased cSHMT protein levels when rat HCF was expressed.

(1991) Int. J. Cancer 49, 329–334 and Saito, S., Orikasa, S., Satoh, M., Ohyama, C., Ito, A., and Takahashi, T. (1997) Jpn. J. Cancer Res. (Gann) 88, 652–659). We now report two disialogangliosides, G1 and G2, found in the RCC cell line TOS-1. G1 from TOS-1 cells was characterized as having a novel hybrid structure between ganglio-series (region I as in Structure FTI; same as the terminal structure of ganglioside GM2), and the lacto-series type 1 (region II). The characterization was based on reactivity with various monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with defined epitope specificity, as well as monosaccharide and fatty acid component analysis, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the intact compound. G1 showed strong reactivity with mAb RM2, raised originally against TOS-1 cells, and weak cross-reactivity with anti-GM2 mAb MK-1–8. The antigen is hereby termed GalNAc disialosyl Lc4Cer (IV4GalNAcIV3NeuAcIII6NeuAcLc4; abbreviated GalNAcDSLc4). G2 was identified by1H NMR and mass spectrometry as having a structure similar to Structure FTI but without the GalNAcβ1→4 substitution and showed strong reactivity with mAb FH9 reported previously to be specific for disialosyl lacto-series type 1 (disialosyl Lc4) having vicinal α2→3 and α2→6 sialosyl residues, an antigen associated with human colonic cancer. Clinicopathological studies indicate that expression of these disialoganglioside antigens in RCC tissue is correlated with the metastatic potential of RCC. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the level of higher gangliosides is correlated with degree of metastatic potential, and cell lines derived from metastatic deposits of RCC are characterized by high expression of disialogangliosides (Saito, S., Orikasa, S., Ohyama, C., Satoh, M., and Fukushi, Y.

This general idea is supported particularly by tumor cell adhesion to E-selectin expressed on activated endothelial cells. This process is mediated by the E-selectin epitope expressed on tumor cells, which was identified as either sialosyl-Lex(SLex), sialosyl-Lea (SLea), or their analogs (for review, see Refs. 1Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brodt P. Brodt P. Cell Adhesion and Invasion in Cancer Metastasis. Landes/Springer-Verlag, Austin TX1996: 167-242Google Scholar, 3Kannagi R. Glycoconj.

Orikasa S. Ohyama C. Satoh M. Fukushi Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, expression of SLex and dimeric Lex in RCC is higher in differentiated than in undifferentiated form and is not correlated with RCC metastasis (5Fukushi Y. Orikasa S. Shepard T. Hakomori S. J. Urol. 1986; 135: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Fukushi Y. Ohtani H. Orikasa S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This trend is opposite to that in other types of cancer (see above).Two RCC cell lines derived from its metastatic deposits, TOS-1 and ACHN, are characterized by high expression of disialogangliosides in addition to GM2 but do not express SLex or SLea(7Satoh M. Handa K. Saito S. Tokuyama S. Ito A. Miyao N. Orikasa S. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1932-1938PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, an unknown mechanism mediated by glycoepitopes different from SLex, SLea, or their analogs should be considered for RCC metastasis (7Satoh M. Handa K. Saito S. Tokuyama S. Ito A. Miyao N. Orikasa S. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1932-1938PubMed Google Scholar). In immunohistological (8Satoh M. Nejad F.M. Nakano O. Ito A. Kawamura S. Ohyama C. Saito S. Orikasa S. Tohoku J. Exp.

Levery S.B. Salyan M.E.K. Goldberg R.I. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5644-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further studies indicated that two other novel disialogangliosides are found in RCC tissue as well as TOS-1 cells, and that DSGG is the major disialoganglioside of ACHN but is absent from TOS-1 (see “Discussion”). We report here that the two major disialogangliosides (G1 and G2) present in TOS-1 cells and RCC are not DSGG but have entirely different properties. Their structures were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of intact compounds. G1 is identified as a novel, hybrid structure between ganglio-series and lacto-series type 1, characterized by strong reactivity with mAb RM2, raised originally against TOS-1 cells, and by weak cross-reactivity with anti-GM2 mAb MK-1–8. G2 has the same lacto-series type 1 chain, 2Glycosphingolipids are abbreviated according to the recommendations of the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN for lipids: (1977) Eur. J.

In this study, we describe isolation and detailed characterization of G1 and G2 and discuss the possible relationship of their expression to RCC malignancy.DISCUSSIONMany studies indicate that certain GSLs and gangliosides in tumor cells define their malignancy, in terms of metastatic potential (1Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial, comparative study on GSL and ganglioside patterns showed enhanced expression of GM2 or gangliosides higher than GM2 (including slow-migrating disialoganglioside species) in RCC having metastatic deposits and in the deposits themselves compared with RCC without metastatic deposits (4Saito S. Orikasa S. Ohyama C. Satoh M. Fukushi Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies were focused on the following: (a) establishment of RCC cell lines, and their tumor cell biological properties (8Satoh M. Nejad F.M. Nakano O. Ito A. Kawamura S. Ohyama C. Saito S. Orikasa S. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); (b) biochemical characterization of major gangliosides showing enhanced expression in RCC tissues, identified as monosialosyl- and disialosylgalactosylgloboside (MSGG and DSGG) (10Saito S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5644-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mAb 5F3 directed to RCC gangliosides; 3A ganglioside from RCC tissue showing the same TLC mobility as G1 (i.e. between that of GD1a and GD1b) but not showing reactivity with RM2, was found. mAb 5F3 was prepared against this ganglioside. Immunohistological studies of many cases of RCC, using mAbs RM1, RM2, and 5F3, showed clear correlation between metastatic potential and the epitopes defined by these mAbs (A. Ito, Dr. Med. Sci. (Ph.D. thesis) presented at Tohoku Univ. School of Medicine, Japan, 1997). and (d) application of these antibodies to compare expression of defined epitopes in RCC having metastatic deposits, the deposits themselves, and RCC without metastatic deposits. Expression of each of the antigens defined by RM2, RM1, and 5F3 was correlated with metastatic potential (9Saito S. Orikasa S. Satoh M. Ohyama C. Ito A. Takahashi T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. ( Gann ). 1997; 88: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).3 This series of studies indicated that in addition to previously identified DSGG two other disialogangliosides are found as major components of RCC and TOS-1 cells: G1 (defined by mAb RM2) and G2 (defined by mAb FH9). Expression of SLex or dimeric Lex in RCC was found to be correlated with degree of differentiation, but not with metastatic potential (5Fukushi Y. Orikasa S. Shepard T. Hakomori S. J.

A similar branched ganglio/lacto hybrid with R1 equal to GM2 structure or with R2 equal to Galβ1→3 structure was isolated from brain of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like disorder (22Nakao T.

The first linear-type hybrid GSL was found in the liver of English sole (40Ostrander G.K. Levery S.B. Eaton H.L. Salyan M.E.K. Hakomori S. Holmes E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18716-18725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a similar one was found later in roe of striped mullet (23DeGasperi R. Koerner T.A.W. Quarles R.H. Ilyas A.A. Ishikawa Y. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17149-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GalNAcDSLc4 from G1 fraction as described in the present study is also a linear-type hybrid but is derived from human tissue. Expression of ganglio/lacto hybrid structure is apparently repressed in normal mammalian or human tissues, but increases (i.e. is “de-repressed”) under pathological conditions. It is possible that specificities of β 1→4GalNAc or β1→3GlcNAc transferases are mutually restricted to the respective substrate structures under normal conditions but lose their restriction under pathological conditions, including cancer. This phenomenon could be caused by subtle changes in the transferase genes, or post-translational modification of the transferases.Three disialogangliosides are present in RCC tissue. One, expressed in TOS-1 cells, is now identified as GalNAcDSLc4, defined by and reacting strongly with mAb RM2. Another, expressed in ACHN cells is now identified as DSGG, which was previously described as one of the major gangliosides of RCC tissue and is now defined by another mAb (5F3) but not by RM2. The third disialoganglioside, expressed in TOS-1 cells, is now identified as disialosyl Lc4 and is identical to the antigen of mAb FH9, described previously as a colonic cancer-associated antigen (11Fukushi Y. Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Higuchi T. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2859-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In a previous publication (10Saito S. Levery S.B. Salyan M.E.K. Goldberg R.I. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5644-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we mistakenly assigned the specificity of mAb RM2 as being directed to DSGG (G3), although RM2 was raised against TOS-1 cells. The mistake may have arisen because of the following: (a) disialoganglioside fractions prepared from a few cases of RCC tissue contained DSGG and G1 (GalNAc disialosyl Lc4Cer, abbreviated GalNAcDSLc4) in varying proportions; some RCC tissues contained globo-series structures as major component, whereas others contained ganglio/lacto-series structures as major component; (b) DSGG and G1 (GalNAcDSLc4) show identical TLC mobility, i.e.co-migrate together in various solvent systems; (c) the sample prepared from RCC tissue and used for structural analysis contained DSGG as major component but may have been contaminated with a small quantity of G1 showing reactivity with RM2. We have now clarified that RM2 is directed specifically to G1, whereas another mAB, 5F3, is directed specifically to DSGG.3 It is possible that RCC tissue expresses high level of G1 in some cases, and DSGG in other cases. Cell lines representing the former and latter situations are TOS-1 and ACHN respectively.From a clinicopathological and histological point of view, RCC cases expressing either GalNAcDSLc4 or DSGG are highly malignant, and show initiation of lymph node and distant metastasis at an early stage (9Saito S. Orikasa S. Satoh M. Ohyama C. Ito A. Takahashi T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. ( Gann ). 1997; 88: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Preferential adherence of TOS-1 cells to lung tissue, determined by Stamper-Woodruff assay, is based on interaction of major disialoganglioside present in TOS-1 with receptor present on perialveolar endothelial cells. This process is strongly inhibited by RM2 (7Satoh M. Handa K. Saito S. Tokuyama S. Ito A. Miyao N. Orikasa S. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1932-1938PubMed Google Scholar) and is therefore presumed to be mediated by GalNAcDSLc4, rather than DSGG and its corresponding perialveolar receptor. Interestingly, SLex, SLea, or their analogs, which bind to E-selectin, are not involved in this process. Studies on the identification of the receptors for both GalNAcDSLc4 and DSGG are essential to understand mechanisms for RCC metastasis and its possible inhibition. The expression pattern of glycosphingolipid (GSL)1 at the tumor cell surface may define the ability of the tumor cell to interact with specific target cell where the GSL antigen is recognized and may thus promote distant metastasis through the blood circulatory or lymphatic system. This general idea is supported particularly by tumor cell adhesion to E-selectin expressed on activated endothelial cells. This process is mediated by the E-selectin epitope expressed on tumor cells, which was identified as either sialosyl-Lex(SLex), sialosyl-Lea (SLea), or their analogs (for review, see Refs. 1Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brodt P. Brodt P. Cell Adhesion and Invasion in Cancer Metastasis. Landes/Springer-Verlag, Austin TX1996: 167-242Google Scholar, 3Kannagi R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). An initial study of GSL patterns of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and its metastatic deposits indicated that enhanced expression of higher gangliosides having TLC mobility similar to or slower than that of GM2 in original RCC tissue is correlated with metastatic potential (4Saito S. Orikasa S. Ohyama C. Satoh M. Fukushi Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, expression of SLex and dimeric Lex in RCC is higher in differentiated than in undifferentiated form and is not correlated with RCC metastasis (5Fukushi Y. Orikasa S. Shepard T. Hakomori S. J. Urol. 1986; 135: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Fukushi Y. Ohtani H. Orikasa S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This trend is opposite to that in other types of cancer (see above). Two RCC cell lines derived from its metastatic deposits, TOS-1 and ACHN, are characterized by high expression of disialogangliosides in addition to GM2 but do not express SLex or SLea(7Satoh M. Handa K. Saito S. Tokuyama S. Ito A. Miyao N. Orikasa S. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1932-1938PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, an unknown mechanism mediated by glycoepitopes different from SLex, SLea, or their analogs should be considered for RCC metastasis (7Satoh M. Handa K. Saito S. Tokuyama S. Ito A. Miyao N. Orikasa S. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1932-1938PubMed Google Scholar). In immunohistological (8Satoh M. Nejad F.M. Nakano O. Ito A. Kawamura S. Ohyama C. Saito S. Orikasa S. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and clinicopathological (9Saito S. Orikasa S. Satoh M. Ohyama C. Ito A. Takahashi T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. ( Gann ). 1997; 88: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) studies using a series of mAbs directed to di- and monosialogangliosides of RCC, positive staining with these antibodies in original RCC tissue was correlated with later incidence of metastasis. Disialosylgalactosylgloboside (DSGG) was identified previously as one of the major disialogangliosides from RCC tissues (10Saito S. Levery S.B. Salyan M.E.K. Goldberg R.I. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5644-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further studies indicated that two other novel disialogangliosides are found in RCC tissue as well as TOS-1 cells, and that DSGG is the major disialoganglioside of ACHN but is absent from TOS-1 (see “Discussion”). We report here that the two major disialogangliosides (G1 and G2) present in TOS-1 cells and RCC are not DSGG but have entirely different properties. Their structures were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of intact compounds. G1 is identified as a novel, hybrid structure between ganglio-series and lacto-series type 1, characterized by strong reactivity with mAb RM2, raised originally against TOS-1 cells, and by weak cross-reactivity with anti-GM2 mAb MK-1–8. G2 has the same lacto-series type 1 chain, 2Glycosphingolipids are abbreviated according to the recommendations of the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN for lipids: (1977) Eur. J.

Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Higuchi T. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2859-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe isolation and detailed characterization of G1 and G2 and discuss the possible relationship of their expression to RCC malignancy. DISCUSSIONMany studies indicate that certain GSLs and gangliosides in tumor cells define their malignancy, in terms of metastatic potential (1Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial, comparative study on GSL and ganglioside patterns showed enhanced expression of GM2 or gangliosides higher than GM2 (including slow-migrating disialoganglioside species) in RCC having metastatic deposits and in the deposits themselves compared with RCC without metastatic deposits (4Saito S. Orikasa S. Ohyama C. Satoh M. Fukushi Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our subsequent studies were focused on the following: (a) establishment of RCC cell lines, and their tumor cell biological properties (8Satoh M. Nejad F.M. Nakano O. Ito A. Kawamura S. Ohyama C. Saito S. Orikasa S. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); (b) biochemical characterization of major gangliosides showing enhanced expression in RCC tissues, identified as monosialosyl- and disialosylgalactosylgloboside (MSGG and DSGG) (10Saito S.

Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5644-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mAb 5F3 directed to RCC gangliosides; 3A ganglioside from RCC tissue showing the same TLC mobility as G1 (i.e. between that of GD1a and GD1b) but not showing reactivity with RM2, was found. mAb 5F3 was prepared against this ganglioside. Immunohistological studies of many cases of RCC, using mAbs RM1, RM2, and 5F3, showed clear correlation between metastatic potential and the epitopes defined by these mAbs (A. Ito, Dr. Med. Sci. (Ph.D. thesis) presented at Tohoku Univ. School of Medicine, Japan, 1997). and (d) application of these antibodies to compare expression of defined epitopes in RCC having metastatic deposits, the deposits themselves, and RCC without metastatic deposits. Expression of each of the antigens defined by RM2, RM1, and 5F3 was correlated with metastatic potential (9Saito S. Orikasa S. Satoh M. Ohyama C. Ito A. Takahashi T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. ( Gann ). 1997; 88: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).3 This series of studies indicated that in addition to previously identified DSGG two other disialogangliosides are found as major components of RCC and TOS-1 cells: G1 (defined by mAb RM2) and G2 (defined by mAb FH9). Expression of SLex or dimeric Lex in RCC was found to be correlated with degree of differentiation, but not with metastatic potential (5Fukushi Y. Orikasa S. Shepard T. Hakomori S. J.

Studies on the identification of the receptors for both GalNAcDSLc4 and DSGG are essential to understand mechanisms for RCC metastasis and its possible inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2104687412,"Drosophila nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) is an ISWI-containing protein complex that facilitates nucleosome mobility and transcriptional activation in an ATP-dependent manner. Numerous studies have implicated histone acetylation in transcriptional activation. We investigated the relative contributions of these two chromatin modifications to transcription in vitro of a chromatinized adenovirus E4 minimal promoter that contains binding sites for the GAL4-VP16 activator. We found that NURF could remodel chromatin and stimulate transcription irrespective of the acetylation status of histones. In contrast, hyperacetylation of histones in the absence of NURF was unable to stimulate transcription, suggesting that NURF-dependent chromatin remodeling is an obligatory step in E4 promoter activation. When chromatin templates were first hyperacetylated and then incubated with NURF, significantly greater transcription stimulation was observed. The results suggest that changes in chromatin induced by acetylation of histones and the mobilization of nucleosomes by NURF combine synergistically to facilitate transcription. Experiments using single and multiple rounds of transcription indicate that these chromatin modifications stimulate transcription preinitiation as well as reinitiation.

In the nucleosome core particle, winding of 147 bp1 of DNA over an octamer of histones creates severe distortion of the DNA helix and obscures roughly half of the helix surface (reviewed in Refs. 6Luger K.

Strategies to destabilize chromatin include the use of homopolymeric stretches of DNA that resist bending; architectural, high mobility group-type proteins that unfold nucleosome arrays; histone-modifying enzymes that covalently alter specific residues of the histone tails; and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that facilitate nucleosome mobility (reviewed in Refs. 8Wu C.

In addition, the passage of an elongating RNA polymerase is also facilitated by distinct proteins that alter chromatin structure (16Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Nature. 2000; 407: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). ATP-utilizing chromatin remodeling complexes can be classified into two main groups, containing either the SWI2/SNF2 or the related ISWI ATPases and their close relatives (reviewed in Refs. 17Eisen J.A.

ISWI-containing complexes are smaller and are composed of 2–5 subunits. Both types of chromatin remodelers use the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to increase nucleosome mobility by changing nucleosome conformation (19Lorch Y. Zhang M. Kornberg R.D.

The histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases, which catalyze the reversible modification of specific lysines on the N-terminal histone tails, are the most extensively studied of the histone-modifying enzymes. The similarity of Tetrahymena p55 HAT and mammalian HDAC1 to genetically defined transcriptional regulators provided the first link between these histone-modifying enzymes and transcription (33Brownell J.E.

Although the separate contributions of histone hyperacetylation and ATP-driven chromatin remodeling to transcription are well known, the interrelationships between these two major types of chromatin modifications and their relative contributions to the activation process are only beginning to be explored. Genetic studies indicate that the yeast SWI2/SNF2 and GCN5 genes perform independent but overlapping functions during transcriptional activation (55Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell.

To date, however, no biochemical studies have examined the mechanistic relationship between histone hyperacetylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. To address this question, we analyzed the relative contributions ofDrosophila nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) and histone acetylation to the activation of a model chromatin template in vitro. Drosophila NURF was identified as a four-subunit, ISWI-containing complex that has been implicated in transcriptional activation of chromatin (62Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C.

Other ISWI-containing complexes related to NURF have subsequently been characterized fromDrosophila (ACF (68Varga-Weisz P.D. Wilm M. Bonte E. Dumas K. Mann M. Becker P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and CHRAC (21Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)) and human cells (RSF (30LeRoy G. Orphanides G. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Science. 1998; 282: 1900-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and WCRF/hACF (69Bochar D.A. Savard J. Wang W. Lafleur D.W. Moore P. Cote J. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14787-14790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). In a previous report, we demonstrated that purified NURF enables activation of a chromatin template by GAL4-HSF at an early step in the process of transcription (27Mizuguchi G. Tsukiyama T. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate synergism between the hyperacetylation of histones and nucleosome remodeling by NURF. Histone hyperacetylation alone did not stimulate transcription from our model chromatin template. However, in combination, the addition of NURF to hyperacetylated chromatin leads to synergistic activation of transcription. We suggest that a hierarchy exists in which NURF-dependent chromatin remodeling is an obligatory step during promoter activation. By the use of single and multiple round transcription experiments we demonstrate that the two types of chromatin modification stimulate transcription of chromatin both at the preinitiation and reinitiation stages. FLAG epitope-tagged human p300 was expressed in Sf9 cells after infection with recombinant baculovirus, and protein was purified as described elsewhere (71Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.

The S-190 extract (275 μl; ∼7.0 mg of protein) was incubated with purifiedDrosophila core histones (4.5–5.0 μg) (81Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G.

Cosmid pWEGIE-0 DNA (5 μg), ATP (3 mm), creatine phosphate (30 mm), creatine phosphokinase (1 μg/ml), and MgCl2 (7 mm) were added in a final volume of 700 μl, and assembly was carried out at 26 °C for 6 h. Sucrose gradient purification of preassembled chromatin was performed essentially as described (79Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.8 ml of preassembled chromatin mixture was applied onto a Beckman SW41 tube and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 26,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. The sucrose gradient buffer was 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 35 mm NaCl containing from 30 to 50% (w/v) sucrose. 1.0-ml gradient fractions were collected, and DNA concentration was determined after 1% agarose gel electrophoresis of an aliquot (40 μl) by ethidium bromide staining. The sucrose gradient fraction was directly subjected to treatment of the histone acetyltransferases. Typically, 100 μl (1.4 μg of DNA equivalent) of the gradient fraction was incubated at 26 °C for 30 min with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium butylate, 1 mm acetyl-CoA (lithium salt; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and ∼5 pmol of p300 or P/CAF complex. Hyperacetylated chromatin was further purified and subjected to chromatin remodeling and transcription. For conventional purification of hyperacetylated chromatin, Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in a SizeSep-400 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with elution buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to chromatin fractions after purification to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. DNA content was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. For analysis of histone acetylation by SDS-PAGE and fluorography, 100 μl (1.4 μg of DNA equivalent) of the sucrose gradient purified chromatin was processed as described above, except that 1 nmol of [3H]acetyl-CoA was introduced in place of 1 mm acetyl-CoA (lithium salt). The reaction was quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE. The gels were then stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue and exposed for fluorography. For Triton-acid-urea gel analysis, samples were processed as described above, using 1 mm acetyl-CoA (lithium salt). The acetylated chromatin was then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed on a TAU gel, essentially as described (82Krajewski W.A. Becker P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the purified transcription system, typically 40 ng of chromatin (40 μl of spin column-purified chromatin) was preincubated in 80 μl (final volume) containing 25 ng of TFIIA, 15 ng of TFIIB, ∼120 ng of immunopurified TFIID, 50 ng of TFIIE, 50 ng of TFIIF, ∼40 ng of purified TFIIH, 10 ng of TFIIS, ∼30 ng of RNA polymerase II, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl, 40 mm KCl, 2.6% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (final concentration), 3.75 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min at 26 °C to form preinitiation complexes and then transcribed for 10 min at 26 °C with the addition of ribonucleotide triphosphates (0.55 mm final concentration). Transcripts were detected by primer extension using a 32P-labeled AdE4 primer corresponding to positions 72–99 of the transcribed strand of pWEGIE-0. cDNA products were analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Quantitation of transcripts was performed on a Fuji Bio-Image Analyzer. For transcription in a crude system, soluble nuclear fraction (nuclear extract) was prepared from 0–12-h Drosophila embryos as described (85Kamakaka R.T. Tyree C.M. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Reactions were performed as described above, except that 70 μg of the soluble nuclear fraction was used instead of purified general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. For the heparin challenge protocol, reactions were performed essentially as described for transcription with the purified system. A synthetic RNA polymerase II pause at +5 site was created by the addition of 0.55 mm ATP, 0.55 mm CTP, and 0.55 mm UTP. Following incubation at 26 °C for 5 min, 400 ng of heparin and 0.55 mm GTP were added to block reinitiation of RNA polymerase II, and the reactions were incubated for a further 30 min at 30 °C (87Zheng X.M.

Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion analysis and sequential Southern blot hybridization were performed as described (62Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 686-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 50 μl (∼50 ng of DNA equivalent) of spin column-purified chromatin, 0.5 μl of NURF fraction, ATP (0.5 mm final concentration), and 0.5 pmol of GAL4 derivative (GAL4-VP16) were mixed and adjusted to 65 μl with elution buffer. The reaction was incubated at 26 °C for 30 min and subjected to micrococcal nuclease or restriction enzyme digestion. For MNase digestion, the reaction mixture was directly treated with enzyme and analyzed as described (27Mizuguchi G. Tsukiyama T. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For restriction enzyme digestion, the reaction mixture was incubated with either 0.5 unit of BamHI (digested at position −46) or 0.5 unit of HaeII (digested at position +98), at 26 °C for 30 min. Digested DNA samples were deproteinized, precipitated with ethanol, and redigested withPstI and ClaI. Samples were loaded on a 1.3% agarose gel and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization as for the MNase assay. To analyze the relative contributions of histone acetylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling to transcription, we used a 9-kilobase pair cosmid (pWEGIE-0) containing five tandemly repeated GAL4 binding sites upstream of the adenovirus E4 core promoter (80Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental procedure for reconstitution and acetylation of pWEGIE-0 chromatin is outlined in Fig.1 A. After assembly with theDrosophila embryo S-190 extract and purifiedDrosophila core histones, chromatin is purified by sucrose gradient sedimentation. This procedure removes the bulk of nonhistone proteins, leaving histones as the predominant proteins in the chromatin preparation, as judged by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (79Kamakaka R.T. Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1779-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified chromatin is then modified with a HAT and acetyl-CoA, followed by repurification on a Sepharose CL4B spin column, to preclude acetylation of remodeling proteins and transcription factors that are introduced subsequently. Chromatin is next incubated with saturating amounts of the transcription activator GAL4-VP16 and saturating amounts of purified NURF and ATP to allow the mobilization of nucleosomes. This is followed by the assembly of preinitiation complexes with either aDrosophila soluble nuclear fraction that has little ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity (27Mizuguchi G. Tsukiyama T.

Transcription is then initiated upon the addition of ribonucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), and the RNA products after 10 min of transcription are analyzed by primer extension. We note thatDrosophila embryo extracts contain histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases that can modify histones during chromatin assembly (45Sheridan P.L. Mayall T.P. Verdin E. Jones K.A.

Although the precise mechanism of malignant transformation by Tax is unclear, it is well established that Tax represses the transcription function of the tumor suppressor p53, possibly accelerating the accumulation of genetic mutations that are critical in HTLV-I-mediated malignant transformation. Tax repression of p53 transcription function appears to occur, at least in part, through competition for the cellular coactivator CBP/p300. In this study, we characterize the effect of Tax on the p53 family member, p73. We demonstrate that Tax also represses the transcription function of p73β and that the repression is reciprocal in vivo, consistent with the idea that both transcription factors may compete for CBP/p300 in vivo. We provide evidence showing that both Tax and p73 interact strongly with the C/H1 domain of CBP and that their binding to this region is mutually exclusive in vitro. This finding provides evidence supporting the idea that reciprocal transcriptional repression between Tax and p73 is mediated through coactivator competition.

Yodoi J. Sagawa K. Takatsuki K. Uchino H. Blood. 1977; 50: 481-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Watanabe T. Int. J. Hematol. 1997; 66: 257-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only a small percentage of people infected with HTLV-I develop ATL, generally 20–40 years following infection (3Murphy E.L. Hanchard B. Figueroa J.P. Gibbs W.N. Lofters W.S. Campbell M. Goedert J.J. Blattner W.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 43: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The infrequency of ATL, coupled with the long latency period, suggests that ATL occurs as a consequence of multiple genetic mutations that accumulate during the prolonged period of asymptotic HTLV-I infection. Although the molecular basis of HTLV-I pathogenesis is not well understood, there is strong emerging evidence that expression of the viral trans-activator protein Tax plays an essential role in the oncogenic process. Indeed, the expression of Tax is able to immortalize primary T-cells (4Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Radant I. Alt M. Fleckenstein B. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Ramstedt U. J.

Once activated, p53 induces expression of genes critical for cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, thus preventing the transmission of genetic mutations to progeny cells (31Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6667) Google Scholar). Loss of p53 activity has been found in 60% of human malignancies examined (32Harris N. Brill E. Shohat O.

Most interesting, in HTLV-I-infected and Tax-expressing cells, p53 is present at elevated levels, with a relatively low frequency of mutation (∼25%) (12Cereseto A. Diella F. Mulloy J.C. Cara A.

Paradoxically, several studies have demonstrated that although generally wild type, p53 is functionally inactive. For example, HTLV-I-infected cells do not respond appropriately to a variety of p53 stimuli, including gamma and ionizing irradiation (12Cereseto A. Diella F. Mulloy J.C. Cara A. Michieli P.

Cereseto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C. Franchini G. J.

Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several recent studies provide evidence showing that Tax inhibition of the tumor suppressor activities of p53 is directly due to Tax inhibition of p53 transcription function (21Akagi T. Ono H.

Dapolito G. Kurimasa A. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 396-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); thus, Tax appears to compromise p53 function via an indirect mechanism. Several reports have indicated that Tax repression of p53 may occur through alterations in the phosphorylation state of p53 (23Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Brady J.N. J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other studies indicate that the repression occurs as a consequence of competition between Tax and p53 for the cellular coactivators CBP/p300 (25Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I.

Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The site of competition on CBP/p300 appears to be the KIX domain (amino acids 588–683), as both Tax and p53 have previously been shown to bind to this region, and their binding is mutually exclusive (25Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Ariumi Y. Kaida A. Lin J.Y. Hirota M. Masui O. Yamaoka S. Taya Y. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that Tax may attenuate p53 function by abrogating the p53-KIX interaction, thus reducing the capacity of p53 to recruit CBP/p300 to target promoters. Recently, a new member of the p53 gene family has been identified, known as p73 (45Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P.

An exception is T-lymphocytes, which lack p73β, but express p73α (48De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp.

As predicted from local regions of strong homology in the DNA binding domains of both proteins, p73 binds the canonical p53-binding sites (55Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D.

Furthermore, when ectopically expressed, p73 can trans-activate a variety of p53 promoters (p21, bax, mdm2, andGADD45) and induce apoptosis in p53-deficient cell lines (45Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A.

Similar to p53, the activation domain of p73 interacts with the cellular coactivators CBP/p300 (60Zeng X. Li X. Miller A. Yuan Z. Yuan W. Kwok R.P. Goodman R. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); however, the site of interaction appears to differ. Whereas p53 interacts with a carboxyl-terminal region and the KIX domain (25Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 43Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), p73 has recently been shown to bind the C/H1 domain of CBP, located near the amino terminus of the coactivator (60Zeng X. Li X. Miller A. Yuan Z. Yuan W. Kwok R.P. Goodman R. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). p73 has been classified as a possible tumor suppressor based on substantial sequence homology and functional similarity with p53. This classification was strengthened by the observation that thep73 gene maps to chromosome 1p36, a region frequently deleted in several malignancies including neuroblastomas, colorectal cancers, and breast cancers (45Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in lymphoid malignancies there is evidence that hypermethylation, and thus silencing, of thep73 gene may play a role in the development and/or progression of the neoplasm (65Corn P.G.

Asou H. Sakashita A. Said J. Tatsumi E. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 94: 1113-1120PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of a single p73 allele has been linked to γ-radiation-induced T-cell lymphomas (67Herranz M. Santos J. Salido E. Fernandez-Piqueras J. Serrano M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2068-2071PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that deregulated E2F-1 induction of p73 might promote a p53-independent, tumor suppressor pathway and that perhaps many of the previously attributed “p53-independent” anti-tumorigenic activities may be due directly to p73 (68Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, other studies have failed to show mutations in the p73 gene in a wide variety of tumor types. Normal expression of p73 is observed in many malignant and non-malignant cells, and some cancers actually shown increased levels of p73. In contrast to p53-deficient mice, p73−/− mice show no increased susceptibility to spontaneous malignancies. These conflicting results suggest that altered expression of the p73 gene, rather than a loss of p73 function, may play a role in malignant transformation. In this report, we investigate the function of p73 in HTLV-I-transformed, Tax-expressing T-cell lines. We demonstrate that in the presence of Tax the stability of p73β is increased, yet, paradoxically, the transcription function of p73β is decreased. We also show that in the presence of p73 the transcription function of Tax is reduced, indicating that the transcriptional repression is reciprocal. The reciprocal transcriptional repression appears to arise from intracellular competition for CBP/p300, an observation very similar to that reported for Tax repression of p53 (25Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki T. Uchida-Toita M. Yoshida M.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although these effects of Tax on p73 function are very analogous to the effects of Tax on p53 function, we provide evidence indicating that the site of competition on the surface of CBP/p300 differs. We demonstrate biochemically that both Tax and p73β bind strongly to the C/H1 domain of CBP and that the binding of the two transcription factors is mutually exclusive in vitro. These data suggest that Tax may inactivate p73β transcription function by specifically competing for the p73-C/H1 interaction in vivo. Disruption of both the p53 and p73β interactions with CBP/p300 in HTLV-I-infected cells may alter the transcription function of these key regulatory proteins. HTLV-I-negative T-cells (CEM, HUT-78, Jurkat, and Molt-4) and HTLV-I-transformed T-cells (C8166/45, C91/PL, MT2, SLB-1, and HUT-102) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The HCT-116 cells and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. For transient cotransfection assays (69Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Nyborg J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4849-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), cells were grown to a density of 106 cells/ml and transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a constant amount of DNA. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) with a Turner Designs model TD 20-e luminometer.

Following ligand binding, the IGF-I receptor is internalized, and the receptor·ligand complex dissociates as the ligand is degraded by endosomal proteinases. In the present study we show that the inhibition of endosomal IGF-I-degrading enzymes in human breast and murine lung carcinoma cells by the cysteine proteinase inhibitors, E-64 and CA074-methyl ester, profoundly altered receptor trafficking and signaling. In treated cells, intracellular ligand degradation was blocked, and although the receptor and two substrates, Shc and Insulin receptor substrate, were hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine, IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis, anchorage-independent growth, and matrix metalloproteinase synthesis were inhibited. The results suggest that ligand processing by endosomal proteinases is a key step in receptor signaling and function and a potential target for therapy.

The receptor for the type 1 insulin like growth factor (IGF-IR)1 and its ligands IGF-I and IGF-II regulate normal somatic growth during embryogenesis and post-natal development (1Werner H. Woloschak M. Adamo M. Shen-Orr Z. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7451-7455Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, IGF-I and its receptor have also been implicated in the development of several human malignancies such as glio- and neuroblastomas, breast, lung, colon, and prostate carcinomas (2Baserga R. Resnicoff M. Dews M. Endocrine. 1997; 7: 99-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IGF-I has been shown to regulate the induction and maintenance of the transformed phenotype and the acquisition of the invasive/metastatic phenotype (3Werner H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Long L. Rubin R. Brodt P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). IGF-I binding to its cell surface receptor activates intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity generating docking sites for src homology or phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing proteins and leading to activation of downstream signaling cascades (5Dey B.R. Frick K. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Furlanetto R.W. Mol Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This is coupled to ligand-mediated internalization of the receptor leading initially to attenuation of the IGF-I response through down-regulation of plasma membrane receptor levels and subsequently to receptor recycling to the cell surface (6Lin F.T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These processes of receptor internalization and recycling have long been regarded as key events in the regulation of receptor activity (7Ceresa B.P. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the acidic milieu of the endosomes, ligand dissociation from its receptor is thought to be required for receptor recycling to the cell surface, and abrogation of ligand dissociation leads to the intraendosomal accumulation of ligand·receptor complexes (8Di Guglielmo G.M. Drake P.G. Baass P.C. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the case of insulin, ligand-receptor dissociation at acidic pH values is coupled to intraendosomal proteolysis by an as yet undefined proteinase (9Authier F. Rachubinski R.A. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3010-3016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For other internalized ligands such as glucagon or epidermal growth factor (10Authier F. Mort J.S.

These studies define a tight coupling between receptor-ligand internalization, ligand dissociation and proteolysis, and receptor trafficking in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Previously one of our laboratories reported that treatment of murine Lewis lung carcinoma subline H-59 cells with the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64 blocked their invasiveness in vitro and inhibited liver metastases formation in vivo (12Navab R. Mort J.S. Brodt P. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1997; 15: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present work, we investigated further the molecular mechanism underlying the E-64 effects using H-59 and MCF-7 cells. We show here that E-64 and a second cathepsin B inhibitor, CA074-methyl ester (ME), inhibited endosomal degradation of IGF-I, and this led to an alteration of IGF-I receptor signaling. Under these conditions, the IGF-I receptor, as well as the signaling molecules Shc and IRS-1, were highly tyrosine-phosphorylated. On the other hand, IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis, anchorage-independent growth, and MMP-2 synthesis were all inhibited. Selective intervention at the internalization/degradation level may be of therapeutic relevance in abrogating IGF-I-mediated tumor formation and metastasis. H-59 is a highly metastatic subline of the Lewis lung carcinoma with metastatic predilection for the liver, developed by one of our laboratories (13Brodt P. Reich R. Moroz L.A. Chambers A.F. Biochim.

Thymidine incorporation and soft agar cloning assays were performed as follows: semiconfluent cultures of H-59 or MCF-7 were cultured in serum free-medium for 24 h with or without E-64, dispersed, seeded onto 96-well polystyrene plates (Falcon), and incubated with different concentrations of IGF-I with or without E-64 for 54 h prior to pulsing with 0.1 mCi/ml of [3H]thymidine for 18 h. For soft agar cloning (17Saiga T. Ohbayashi T. Tabuchi K. Midorikawa O. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1987; 23: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) the tumor cells were mixed with a solution of 0.8% agar added to an equal volume of a 2× concentrated RPMI-fetal calf serum medium with or without 10 μg/ml of E-64, plated on solidified 2% agar at a concentration of 104 cells/plate, and supplemented with 1 ml of RPMI-fetal calf serum containing or not 10 μg/ml of E-64. This medium was replenished on alternate days for 12 days. MMP-2 synthesis was analyzed by Northern and Western blotting and by gelatin zymography, which were performed as previously described (18Long L. Nip J. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3732-3737PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, 32P-labeled 1.1-kb human MMP-2 and 800-bp rat cyclophilin (19Nip J. Rabbani S.A. Shibata H.R. Brodt P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) cDNA fragments were used as hybridization probes. Western blotting and gelatin zymography were performed on concentrated (60×) serum-free media conditioned by H-59 cells for 48 h in the presence or absence of IGF-I with or without 10 μg/ml E-64. Blots were probed with a 1:500 dilution of mAb Ab-45 to MMP-2 and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated affinity purified goat anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1:2000. The ligand binding assay and fluorocytometry were used to measure cell surface IGF-I receptors on the murine H-59 and human MCF-7 cells, respectively. 2-day-old H-59 cultures were replenished with fresh medium containing or not 10 μg/ml E-64, and the binding assay was performed 24 h later using 8–1500 pm125I-labeled IGF-I with or without graded concentrations of unlabeled IGF-I. Incubation was for 1 h at 37 °C following which the cells were rinsed and lysed in 0.01 n NaOH containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, and the radioactivity was measured. The number of cells/plate at the time of the assay was determined from triplicate control wells, which were manipulated in a similar manner. The Ligand program (20McPherson G.A. Molenaar P. Raper C. Malta E. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1983; 10: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21McPherson G.A. Comput. Programs Biomed. 1983; 17: 107-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the number of IGF-I binding sites per cell. IGF-I receptors on MCF-7 cells were immunofluorescence-labeled using 5 μg/ml mAb α IR3 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:50). Prior to labeling, the cells were cultured for 24 h in serum free-RPMI with or without 10 μg/ml E-64 then dispersed, reseeded at a density of 105cells/well into 96-well plates, stimulated with 10 ng/ml of IGF-I for 10 min, and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formalin and analyzed using a FACS Calibur system (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Proteolysis of IGF-I was measured using the soluble endosomal extract prepared from rat liver parenchyma (1 ng), and cell lysates (3–15 mg) were derived from H-59 and MCF-7 cells cultured for 24 h with or without 10 μg/ml E-64, lysed by incubation in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.2 m NaCl for 30 min at 4 °C and then clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. These preparations were incubated for various lengths of time at 37 °C with 10−6m unlabeled or 50,000 cpm [125I]-labeled IGF-I in 200 or 400 μl of 50 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 5, respectively. The integrity of the radiolabeled ligand was assessed by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid (9Authier F. Rachubinski R.A. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3010-3016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Authier F. Mort J.S. Bell A.W. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 332: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To measure proteolysis of the unlabeled IGF-I, the samples were acidified with acetic acid (15%) and immediately loaded onto a reverse-phase HPLC column. Reverse-phase HPLC was performed on a Waters model 600 liquid chromatograph equipped with a model U6K sample injector fitted with a 500-ml loop and a mBondapak C18 column (0.39 × 30 cm, 10 mm particle size; Waters). Samples were chromatographed using as eluent a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (Solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (Solvent B) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was carried out using two sequential linear gradients followed by the following isocratic elution: an initial gradient of 0–20% Solvent B (30 min); a second gradient of 20–39% Solvent B (15 min); and a third isocratic elution of 39% Solvent B (15 min). Eluates were monitored on-line for absorbance at 214 nm with a liquid chromatography spectrophotometer. MCF-7 and H-59 cells were treated with 10 ng of IGF-I for 5 min following or not pretreatment with E-64 or CA074-ME as described above. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 30 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and spun at maximal speed in a microfuge for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates (1 to 3 mg) were then immunoprecipitated, respectively, with anti-Shc, anti-IRS-1 (from B. I. Posner), or anti-IGF-IR overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads, washed three times with lysis buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes followed by either immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Sigma) or RC-20 (Transduction Laboratories) conjugated to HRP or with anti-IRS-1 (Calbiochem), anti-Shc, or anti-IGF-IR antibodies. The blots were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence followed by radioautography on Kodak X-Omat AR films. DNA synthesis, anchorage-independent growth, and production of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 are three IGF-I-regulated cellular functions that are critical for the expression of the malignant phenotype (4Long L. Rubin R. Brodt P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Long L. Nip J. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3732-3737PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of MCF-7 and H-59 cells with the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64 at the non-toxic concentration of 10 μg/ml (12Navab R. Mort J.S. Brodt P. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1997; 15: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reduced by factors of 7 and 10, respectively, the cloning efficiency of these cells in semi-solid agar (Fig. 1A) and abrogated [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to IGF-I in both cell lines (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, MMP-2 mRNA synthesis in serum-containing medium, which was previously shown to depend on IGF-IR expression in these cells (23Long L. Navab R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3243-3247PubMed Google Scholar), was reduced by a factor of 2, and this was reflected in reduced levels of MMP-2 protein levels in H-59 conditioned medium analyzed by immunoblotting and gelatin zymography (Fig. 1C). IGF-I-induced MMP-2 production and activity measured following addition of 10 ng/ml IGF-I to serum-starved cells were likewise reduced (Fig. 1C). Endosomal endopeptidases such as cathepsin B and L are inhibited by E-64 and have been implicated in the processing of receptor·ligand complexes (9Authier F. Rachubinski R.A. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3010-3016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Authier F. Mort J.S. Bell A.W. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15798-15807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We postulated that IGF-I receptor-mediated cellular functions in E-64-treated cells were altered as a consequence of perturbed endosomal processing of the internalized receptor-bound IGF-I. Changes in IGF-I proteolysis were therefore investigated in lysates of E-64-treated tumor cells, as well as in isolated liver parenchymal endosomal fractions, which were incubated with exogenous IGF-I at acidic pH values. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis revealed that IGF-I degradation products, which were detectable in the untreated preparations, were absent following E-64 treatment (Fig. 2,A and C). This was subsequently confirmed when cell lysates and endosomal fractions were incubated with radioiodinated IGF-I for 1 h, and trichloroacetic acid precipitation was used to monitor ligand integrity. An increase in trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity over time was evident in the untreated preparation, but this was completely abolished by E-64 pretreatment (Fig. 2, B and D) indicating that IGF-I proteolysis was dramatically reduced. One possible consequence of ligand proteolysis blockade is the endosomal trapping of receptor·ligand complexes leading to a decreased availability of free receptor for recycling at the cell surface. We measured the effect of E-64 treatment on cell surface IGF-I receptor levels on H-59 and MCF-7 cells. Ligand binding analysis revealed that the number of IGF-I binding sites as measured after the addition of 125I-IGF-I to H-59 cells was reduced by more than 2-fold, from 3.9 × 104 sites/cell on untreated to 1.8 × 104 sites/cell on E-64-treated cells (Fig.3A). Flow cytometric analysis with a monoclonal antibody (mAb α IR3) to the α subunit of the human IGF-I receptor revealed that 40 min after the addition of ligand to serum-starved MCF-7 cells, there was a reduction of 45% in the number of immunolabeled cells with the mean intensity of fluorescence declining from 255 to 82 (Fig. 3B). In neither of these cell types did E-64 treatment cause a reduction in IGF-IR mRNA levels (Fig. 3C) or in the total level of immunoprecipitable receptor (Fig. 3D). These experiments suggested that the reduction of IGF-IR expression at the cell surface was not because of a change in receptor transcription or translation. One of the earliest molecular events in IGF-IR ligand-induced signaling is the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor β subunit and the subsequent phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as IRS-1 and Shc. We first measured ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor in E-64- and ME-treated cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-IGF-IR antibodies followed by immunoblotting with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-IGF-IR antibodies. Three experiments were performed for each condition. In all the experiments, we found an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor β subunit in inhibitor-treated cells. For ME-treated cells the means of the increases were 3.75 (p < 0.0007, n = 3)- and 2.08 (p < 0.001, n = 3)-fold, and for E-64-treated cells they were 2.1 (p < 0.002,n = 3)- and 1.33 (p < 0.005,n = 3)-fold compared with IGF-I-treated H-59 and MCF-7 cells, respectively (Fig. 4, Aand B). The different responses to the two inhibitors may reflect a higher efficiency of intracellular uptake of ME because of its increased membrane permeability. Two major substrates of the IGF-IR are Shc and IRS-1. Their interactions with the activated IGF-IR have been mapped to the Tyr950 residue suggesting that they could potentially compete for binding (24Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, a 1.7-fold increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 was noted in ME-treated cells stimulated with IGF-I as compared with cells stimulated with IGF-I only (Fig. 4D, n = 3,p < 0.0008), but no significant change in p52Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was noted (data not shown). In H-59 cells, on the other hand, p52Shc tyrosine phosphorylation increased by 1.9-fold (n = 2) in response to ligand binding in E-64- or ME-pretreated cells (Fig.4C, upper and middle panels), whereas Shc expression per se did not change (Fig. 4C,bottom panel, n = 3). In these cells, no detectable levels of IRS-1 were observed by Western blotting or immunoprecipitation using experimental conditions that identified this protein in MCF-7 cells. It appears therefore that in these cells, differential expression levels of the adaptor proteins Shc and IRS-1 may determine their preferential IGF-IR binding and phosphorylation in response to IGF-I. Our results show that inhibition of cysteine proteinase activity by E-64 resulted in reduced cell surface IGF-IR expression levels and abrogation of cellular responses to IGF-I. In an apparent paradox, however, treatment with this or a second cathepsin B inhibitor, CAO74-ME, also caused an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR β subunit, IRS-1, and Shc. When taken together with our findings that IGF-I proteolysis was blocked in E-64-treated liver parenchymal endosomes and in tumor cell lysates, our results indicate that inhibition of processing of the IGF-IR·IGF-I complex has the following two major consequences: (i) receptor recycling to the plasma membrane is decreased, and (ii) the IGF-IR β subunit and the IRS-1/Shc substrates remain hyperphosphorylated, and this attenuates rather than activates IGF-IR-mediated biological functions such as the induction of DNA synthesis and MMP-2 production. A direct effect of cysteine proteinase inhibitors on the synthesis or activity of tyrosine phosphatases have not, to our knowledge, been documented. Our data may therefore be best reconciled in a model whereby inhibition of IGF-I proteolysis “traps” the receptor·ligand complex in a subcellular compartment that retains the receptor in a hyperphosphorylated state (as represented in Fig. 5). This, in turn, may result in retention of phosphorylated receptor substrates in the same compartment, preventing them from accessing normal signaling pathways in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, receptor retention in the endosomes may trigger an alternate signal transduction cascade that leads to inhibition rather than activation of DNA synthesis and MMP-2 production. Receptor phosphorylation and signaling within the endosomal compartment have been documented for the insulin receptor kinase (15Authier F. Di Guglielmo G.M. Danielsen G.M. Bergeron J.J. Biochem.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4960-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and epidermal growth factor receptor activation and Shc recruitment within endosomes have also been observed (26Di Guglielmo G.M.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reports have linked receptor internalization to the activation of the Shc/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (28Chow J.C.

On the other hand, inappropriate localization of signaling molecules after ligand-induced activation of tyrosine kinase receptors may also lead to the generation of abnormal signaling pathways (30Lauffenburger D.A.

Recently it was reported that anti-p185/HER2 antibody-mediated targeting of a cysteine proteinase inhibitor to a cathepsin B-containing intracellular compartment resulted in growth inhibition of two breast carcinoma cell lines including MCF-7 (32Xing R. Wu F. Mason R.W. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 904-909PubMed Google Scholar). Our model offers mechanistic insight into these observations, suggesting that growth impairment in these cells was related to defective ligand processing in the endosomes. Collectively, the results identify the endocytic apparatus as a critical component of growth factor receptor signaling that can be accessible and sensitive to specific proteinase inhibitors.

Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) shows no such bound quinone, although there are two distal cavities in subunit C that could potentially bind quinone. We have carried out several studies to identify functionally important residues in the yeast SDH (22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

Residues in the unusual carboxyl-terminal extension of the yeast Sdh4p subunit are necessary for maintaining a stable conformation of the anchor domain required for quinone reduction (22Oyedotun K.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23956-23962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The location of these residues and inhibitor sensitivity analysis suggested that the yeast SDH contains at least two quinone-binding sites. The present paper extends these studies to the Sdh4p subunit and provides additional evidence for the two quinone-binding site hypothesis. We isolated and characterized four mutations in the SDH4 gene. The mutants were characterized in vivo for their abilities to support respiratory growth and in vitro for quinone reduction, enzyme assembly and stability, and inhibitor sensitivity. The data show that a distal quinone-binding site (QD) is associated with the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In addition, the low and the high affinity inhibitor-binding sites, which may correspond to the two quinone-binding sites, map to the opposite sides of the membrane. A histidine residue in the matrix-facing loop between helices V and VI is proposed to interact with the catalytic domain. The parental yeast strain, MH125, and the E. coli strain, DH5α, have been described previously (24Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The SDH4 knockout strain, sdh4w2, is an isogenic derivative of MH125 (MH125,SDH4::TRP1) and has been described previously (22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31382-31388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All the yeast media used in this study (YPD, YPG, SG, SD, YPDG, and YPGal) and yeast culture conditions have been described (22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

The proportion of rho−strains in the culture was determined by mating the colonies with the rho° strain, MS10 (matα kar1–1 leu2–3 canR rho 0), and testing for respiratory competence of the diploid on YPG plates. Bacterial strains were routinely grown on LB medium at 37 °C, using ampicillin as the selectable marker. Random mutagenesis was carried out essentially as described previously (25Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23956-23962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A plasmid-borne SDH4 gene, pSDH4–17, was transformed into DH5α. Cells were irradiated with ultraviolet light of 254 nm with a dose rate of 1.4 J m−1s−1 on LB plates in the dark to achieve 1–5% survival. Mutagenized plasmids were isolated from the bacteria and transformed into the SDH4 knockout strain, sdh4w2. Transformants were tested for growth on YPDG, SG, and YPG to identify respiratory-deficient colonies. Respiratory-deficient but rho+ colonies were further analyzed. In order to ensure that any observed respiratory defect is plasmid-mediated, plasmids were rescued from yeast, amplified in DH5α, and re-transformed into the sdh4w2 strain. Mutations were identified by sequencing the entireSDH4 gene. Sequencing was performed by the Department of Biochemistry Core DNA Facilities, University of Alberta (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). To ensure that any phenotype observed is due to mutation in the SDH4 gene (and not to mutation of vector sequence), the SDH4 cassette was subcloned into a non-irradiated pRS416 vector and reintroduced into sdh4W2. YPGal-grown stationary phase cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed in a French pressure cell, and submitochondrial particles prepared by differential centrifugation as described previously (22Oyedotun K.S.

Unless otherwise stated, the succinate-dependent reduction of quinone was monitored spectrophotometrically at 22 °C as the malonate-sensitive, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DB)-mediated reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP). The succinate-dependent, phenazine methosulfate (PMS)-mediated reduction of DCPIP was determined as a measure of the membrane-associated Sdh1p/Sdh2p dimer. This assay only requires that the catalytic dimer be membrane-associated but does not require a catalytically competent membrane domain. Quinone reduction was also directly monitored as the reduction of DB using the wavelength pair, 280 and 325 nm, with a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. The absorption coefficient is 16 mm−1cm−1. Other assays have been described (22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

The effect of quinone on the initial velocity of the succinate-DB reductase activity was measured by varying the concentrations of DB at fixed saturating concentrations of succinate and DCPIP. We evaluated the apparent kinetic parameters,Km and Vmax, from double-reciprocal plots as described previously (22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

Sensitivities to the quinone analog inhibitor, 2-sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol (s-BDNP), were determined by measuring initial velocities of succinate-DB reductase in the presence of fixed concentrations of the inhibitor. The apparent inhibitor constants, Ki(1) andKi(2) were evaluated by fitting data to the equation for noncompetitive inhibition having two nonequivalentKi values (39Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar), y=a(1+I/Ki(1))(1+I/Ki(2)Equation 1 where y is the slope or intercept in the presence of a fixed concentration of the inhibitor I, a is the slope or intercept in the absence of the inhibitor, andKi(1) and Ki(2) are the high affinity and the low affinity inhibition constants, respectively. Membrane fractions (20 mg/ml) were divided into equal aliquots (50 μl) in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and placed on ice. Using a variable temperature block heater, each sample was incubated for 10 min in the absence of succinate and quinone, at temperatures between 22 and 70 °C. After incubation, the sample was cooled to 22 °C and the succinate-DB reductase activity determined. Residual activity was compared with the activities of unheated samples. Preparation of mitochondrial membranes, measurements of covalently bound flavin and protein contents, E. coli transformation, and recombinant DNA methods have been described (22Oyedotun K.S.

An E. coli strain carrying the plasmid-borne SDH4 gene was mutagenized with ultraviolet light and the mutated plasmids were reintroduced into the yeast SDH4-deficient strain, sdh4W2. Mutagenesis in E. coli, rather than in yeast, greatly reduces the proportion of yeast mitochondrial petite mutations isolated. About 6000 Ura+ sdh4W2 transformants were tested for respiratory growth on YPDG and SG. Approximately 1% were impaired for respiratory growth. We isolated and sequenced the SDH4 genes from 20 respiratory-deficient strains that were Ura+ and rho+. Sixteen of these mutants contained frameshift mutations that resulted in null phenotypes. Four mutants contained single base alterations, resulting in the substitutions of Phe-69 with Val (F69V), Ser-71 with Ala (S71A), His-99 with Leu (H99L), and Tyr-89 with a stop codon (Y89OCH). The Y89OCH mutation truncates Sdh4p by removing the third predicted transmembrane segment, TMS-III (Fig.1). The mutated SDH4 genes were reintroduced into the SDH4 knockout strain, sdh4W2, and assayed for respiratory growth on media containing the non-fermentable carbon sources, ethanol, glycerol, or lactate. All the mutant strains were greatly impaired for growth on these media. In order to determine the residual respiratory abilities of the mutant strains, growth on semisynthetic medium containing 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, or 0.5% galactose was also monitored spectrophotometrically. Fig.2 depicts the growth yields monitored as the optical densities at 600 nm of late stationary phase cultures. Growth of yeast strains in this medium is biphasic; an initial fermentative growth is followed by a respiratory phase when the fermentable carbon source is limiting (22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31382-31388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40Bruel C. Manon S. Guerin M. Lemesle-Meunier D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both the wild type and the mutant strains show similar growth rates during the fermentative phase (data not shown). The growth yields of the parental strain, MH125, and the sdh4W2 strain carrying a plasmid-borne wild typeSDH4 gene, pSDH4–17, are similar. As expected, sdh4W2 achieves a growth yield of 10 ± 2% by fermentation alone. The growth yields of the F60V, the S71A, the H99L, and the Y89OCH are significantly reduced (40 ± 3%, 36 ± 2%, 30 ± 1%, and 26 ± 2%, respectively), but it is clear that respiratory growth is not completely abolished. This result is consistent with our observation that the mutant strains can grow slowly on SG medium, with colonies appearing only after 6–7 days of incubation at 30 °C. We conclude that Phe-69, Ser-71, and His-99 are important for the respiratory function of SDH. The Y89OCH strain still exhibits significant respiratory growth (26 ± 2%), compared with the basal fermentative growth of sdh4W2 (10 ± 2%), indicating that respiratory growth is possible without TMS-III.Figure 2Growth of yeast strains on galactose media. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C on semisynthetic liquid medium containing 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.5% galactose, and the optical densities at 600 nm were measured. Precultures were prepared on selective minimal medium containing 2% galactose and 0.01% glucose. These were used to inoculate the main cultures at a starting A600 of 0.1. The cultures were allowed to reach late stationary phase (∼100 h). The relative growth yields are calculated using the final absorbance values reached on 0.5% galactose. The yeast strains are: open squares, MH125; closed squares, sdh4W2/SDH4–17; open circles, F69V;closed circles, S71A; open triangles, H99L; closed triangles, Y89OCH; diamonds, sdh4W2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the possibility that the SDH4 mutations affected the anchoring role of the Sdh4p subunit by determining the covalent FAD contents of mitochondrial membranes prepared from wild type and mutant strains (Table I). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, SDH is the major protein with covalently bound FAD and the covalent flavin levels of mitochondrial membranes quantitatively reflect SDH assembly (41Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 34-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There is no significant difference between the covalent FAD levels of the F69V mutant and the wild type strains, MH125 and SDH4–17. The S71A membranes have slightly reduced covalent FAD levels compared with the wild type values. In contrast, the covalent FAD levels of the H99L and the Y89OCH strains are significantly reduced, suggesting that these mutations induce structural perturbations that impair assembly into the membrane.Table IMeasurements of SDH assembly in yeast mitochondrial membranesYeast strainCovalent FAD 1-aCovalent flavin contents are expressed as pmol FAD mg of protein−1.Specific activity 1-bSpecific activities are expressed as μmol of PMS-mediated DCPIP reduced min−1 mg of protein−1.Turnover no. 1-cTurnover numbers are expressed as μmol of PMS-mediated DCPIP reduced min−1 nmol of covalent FAD−1.MH12530 ± 4102 ± 63400 ± 200sdh4W2/SDH4–1727 ± 286 ± 43200 ± 150F69V24 ± 272 ± 53000 ± 200S71A22 ± 364 ± 32900 ± 120H99L14 ± 319 ± 11400 ± 80Y89OCH12 ± 112 ± 11000 ± 45sdh4W2ND 1-dND, not detectable.ND— 1-eNot determined.Each value represents the mean of triplicate independent determinations ± S.E.1-a Covalent flavin contents are expressed as pmol FAD mg of protein−1.1-b Specific activities are expressed as μmol of PMS-mediated DCPIP reduced min−1 mg of protein−1.1-c Turnover numbers are expressed as μmol of PMS-mediated DCPIP reduced min−1 nmol of covalent FAD−1.1-d ND, not detectable.1-e Not determined.

This activity requires that the membrane domain be competent for anchoring but not for quinone reduction (1Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1992: 163-197Google Scholar). To compare their enzymatic activities, we determined the turnover numbers, based on the covalent FAD contents. As expected, the succinate-PMS reductase activities closely parallel the covalent FAD levels. The activity of the F69V enzyme is not significantly different from the wild type or the SDH4–17 enzymes. There is a slight reduction in the succinate-PMS reductase activity of the S71A enzyme. These data confirm that the primary defects in the F69V and S71A are not due to impaired assembly. In contrast, the H99L and the Y89OCH enzymes show significant reductions in their succinate-PMS reductase activities, indicating assembly defects. We assayed mitochondrial membranes for malonate-sensitive succinate dependent quinone reduction, using the soluble quinone analog DB and the reporter DCPIP (Table II). The succinate-DB reductase activities of F69V, S71A, H99L, and Y89OCH are severely reduced (30%, 26%, 20%, and 18% of the wild type turnover number, respectively). Succinate-DB reductase activity is not detectable in sdh4W2. These values are consistent with the residual levels of respiratory growth seen on limiting galactose (Fig. 2).Table IIEnzymatic activities requiring quinone reductionMH125sdh4W2 pSDH4–17F69VS71AH99LY89OCHsdh4W2Succinate-DB reductase 2-aActivities are expressed as μmol of DB-mediated DCPIP reduced min−1 nmol of covalent FAD−1.3200 ± 200 2-bEach value represents the mean of triplicate independent determinations ± S.E.3100 ± 120960 ± 40830 ± 30640 ± 30576 ± 10ND 2-eND, not detectable or less than 4% of wild type activity.Succinate-cytochrome c"

Since then, it has been demonstrated that other mammalian class II α-mannosidases can participate inN-glycan processing. Thus, the present study was performed to evaluate the catalytic properties of the Sf9 class II α-mannosidase and to more clearly determine its relationship to mammalian Golgi α-mannosidase II. The results showed that the Sf9 enzyme is cobalt-dependent and can hydrolyze Man5GlcNAc2 to Man3GlcNAc2, but it cannot hydrolyze GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2. These data establish that the Sf9 enzyme is distinct from Golgi α-mannosidase II. This enzyme is not a lysosomal α-mannosidase because it is not active at acidic pH and it is localized in the Golgi apparatus. In fact, its sensitivity to swainsonine distinguishes the Sf9 enzyme from all other known mammalian class II α-mannosidases that can hydrolyze Man5GlcNAc2. Based on these properties, we designated this enzyme Sf9 α-mannosidase III and concluded that it probably provides an alternate N-glycan processing pathway in Sf9 cells.

Among them are the Asn-linked glycoproteins, which consist of a polypeptide backbone and an amide-linked oligosaccharide side chain or N-glycan. The N-glycan precursor, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, is initially transferred to newly synthesized proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1and is converted to various mature forms by processing enzymes distributed along the secretory pathway. Processing begins with cleavage of the three glucose residues by ER α-glucosidases, which produce Man9GlcNAc2, generally known as a “high mannose” N-glycan. In higher eukaryotes, high mannose N-glycans may be further processed by ER and Golgi α-mannosidases, which cleave up to six mannose residues. Cleavage of these mannose residues is required before N-glycans can be converted to “hybrid” or “complex” N-glycans by various glycosyltransferases (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). Three types of α-mannosidases are involved inN-glycan processing: endo-α-mannosidase, class I α-mannosidases, and class II α-mannosidases (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.G. Herscovics A.

Class I α-mannosidases cleave the four α1,2-linked mannose residues, converting Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 in the ER and Golgi complex. Historically, the only class II α-mannosidase thought to be involved in N-glycan processing was Golgi α-mannosidase II. This enzyme requires the prior action ofN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and cleaves the terminal α1,3- and α1,6-linked mannose residues from GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 producing GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2. Golgi α-mannosidase II was considered to be essential for the conversion of N-glycan precursors to complex structures. However, when the mouse Golgi α-mannosidase II gene was inactivated, most cell types still produced complex N-glycans (6Chui D. Oh-Eda M. Liao Y.F. Panneerselvam K. Lal A. Marek K.W. Freeze H.H. Moremen K.W. Fukuda M.N. Marth J.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This observation revealed that mice have at least one additional processing class II α-mannosidase, which compensated for the absence of Golgi α-mannosidase II. Furthermore, although null mouse cell extracts could not hydrolyze GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc, they could convert Man5GlcNAc to Man3GlcNAc. This suggested that N-glycan processing was mediated by an α-mannosidase activity, termed α-mannosidase III, which produced a novel Man3GlcNAc2 intermediate in these cells. However, the enzyme(s) responsible for this activity were not purified, nor was the gene encoding this enzyme identified. In a previous study, we cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding a class II α-mannosidase from the lepidopteran insect cell line, Sf9 (7Jarvis D.L. Bohlmeyer D.A. Liao Y.F. Lomax K.K. Merkle R.K. Weinkauf C. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of this enzyme is similar to those of various mammalian Golgi α-mannosidases II. Like the latter enzymes, the Sf9 α-mannosidase is an integral membrane glycoprotein with type II topology. It can hydrolyzep-nitrophenyl α-d-mannopyranoside (pNP-α-Man), and it is inhibited by swainsonine. In the present study, we further examined the catalytic properties of this Sf9 class II α-mannosidase to more clearly determine its relationship to mammalian Golgi α-mannosidase II. The results showed that this enzyme is actually distinct from Golgi α-mannosidase II as its activity is stimulated by cobalt and it can hydrolyze various substrates containing terminal mannose residues but not GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2. In view of these properties, we have designated this enzyme Sf9 α-mannosidase III (SfManIII), and we propose that it functions in an alternateN-glycan processing pathway in Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells are derived from IPLB-Sf21-AE, a cell line originally isolated fromSpodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) ovaries (8Vaughn J.L. Goodwin R.H. Thompkins G.J. McCawley P. In Vitro. 1977; 13: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were maintained in suspension between 0.3 and 3.0 × 106 cells/ml in TNM-FH medium (9Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555.Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 0.1% (w/v) pluronic F68 (BASF Wynandotte Corp., Parsippany, NJ; Ref.10Murhammer D.W. Goochee C.F. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1411-1418Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding the SfManIII ectodomain (amino acids 35–1130) was subcloned into pAcSecG2T (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The resulting plasmid, pAcGST-SfManIII, encoded a hybrid protein consisting of a cleavable signal peptide, the GST protein, and the SfManIII ectodomain under the transcriptional control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. This plasmid was used to produce a recombinant baculovirus, AcGST-SfManIII, which expresses the GST-tagged, secreted form of SfManIII during the very late phase of infection. AcGST-SfManIII was produced by homologous recombination (9Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555.Google Scholar, 11O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar) withBsu36I-digested BacPAK6 viral DNA (12Kitts P.A. Possee R.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 810-817PubMed Google Scholar), plaque-purified twice, amplified in Sf9 cells, and titered by plaque assay (9Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555.Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 12 million cells/75-cm2flask and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell with either AcGST-SfManIII or wild type baculovirus. The cells were cultured for 18 h in TNM-FH medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, then the medium was removed, and the cells were washed and fed with Grace's medium (13Grace T.D. Nature. 1962; 195: 788-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) containing 0.5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. At 36 h post infection, the medium was harvested and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g. The supernatant was harvested, and virus particles were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g. This second supernatant was adjusted to 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and applied at room temperature to a column containing 400 μl of immobilized glutathione-agarose (Pierce) equilibrated with buffer A (100 mm NaMES, pH 6.3, 0.5% Triton X-100). The flow-through was passed back over the column, then the column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A, and the packing was removed, resuspended in a final volume of 1 ml of buffer A, and used for enzyme assays. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207532) Google Scholar) analyses, samples of the starting material, second flow-through, and wash were mixed with an equal volume of 2× protein sample buffer. A sample of the bound material was obtained by treating glutathione-agarose beads with an equal volume of 2× protein sample buffer. All samples were heated at 70 °C for 15 min and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 5 min prior to the analysis. Proteins were visualized by either Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting. For immunoblots, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to an Immobilon™-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA; Ref.15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The membrane was then probed with rabbit anti-GST (Sigma) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI), and antibody binding was detected by a color reaction (16Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of pNP-α-Man was assayed in a 37 °C incubator-shaker using 5 μl of GST-SfManIII in a final volume of 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mm NaMES, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 5 mmpNP-α-Man. The enzyme was assayed in triplicate in each experiment and the results were presented as averages with standard deviations. To examine the effects of metal ions, SfManIII activity assays were done at pH 6.3 in the presence of 1 mm EDTA or various concentrations of CoCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2, or NiCl2. For these assays, the enzyme was preincubated with EDTA or the metal ions for 2 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of pNP-α-Man. To determine the influence of pH, assays were done at various pH values in the presence of 1 mm CoCl2. To measure the effect of swainsonine, the assays were done at pH 6.3 in the presence of 1 mmCoCl2 and various concentrations of swainsonine (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA). All assays were terminated by adding 800 μl of a buffer containing 133 mm glycine, 67 mm NaCl, and 83 mm Na2CO3 (pH 10.4). After removing the beads by centrifugation for 3 min at 13,000 ×g, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 405 nm using a Beckman model DU® 7400 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments). Hydrolysis of various pyridylamine (PA)-tagged glycans was assayed in a 37 °C incubator-shaker using 200 μl of GST-SfManIII in a final volume of 207 μl of buffer A supplemented with 1 mm CoCl2 and 100 pmol of substrate. After various incubation times, the beads were removed by centrifugation for 3 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants were boiled for 3 min. The reaction products were then resolved on a Hypersil APS-2 NH2 HPLC column as previously described (17Gonzalez D.S. Karaveg K. Vandersall-Nairn A.S. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21375-21386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding full-length SfManIII was subcloned into the immediate early baculovirus transfer plasmid, pAcP+E1TV3 (18Jarvis D.L. Weinkauf C. Guarino L.A. Protein. Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein, a mutant form of GFP with enhanced fluorescence at 507 nm (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), was then inserted immediately downstream, in-frame with the SfManIII coding sequence. The resulting plasmid, pAcP+IE1-SfManIII-GFP, encoded a hybrid protein consisting of the full-length SfManIII protein with GFP fused to its C terminus under the transcriptional control of a baculovirus immediate early promoter. This plasmid was used to produce a recombinant baculovirus, AcP+IE1-SfManIII-GFP, which expresses the enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged SfManIII protein during the immediate early phase of infection. AcP+IE1-SfManIII-GFP was produced by homologous recombination (9Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555.Google Scholar, 11O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar) with Bsu36I-digested BacPAK6 viral DNA (12Kitts P.A. Possee R.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 810-817PubMed Google Scholar), plaque-purified twice, amplified in Sf9 cells, and titered by plaque assay (9Summers, M. D., and Smith, G. E. (1987) Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1555.Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were seeded at a density of 300,000 cells/chamber into LAB-TEK® two-chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Napeville, IL), infected with 3 plaque-forming units/cell of AcP+IE1-SfManIII-GFP, and cultured for 18 h in TNM-FH medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were then incubated with either Golgi- or lysosome-specific dyes, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and examined with a Leica TSD-4D CSLM confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). To stain the Golgi, the cells were treated for 40–120 min at 27 °C with Grace's medium containing 0.5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 250 nmBODIPY®TR ceramide (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). To stain the lysosomes, the cells were treated for 4 min at room temperature with Grace's medium containing 0.5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 25 nm LysoTracker™ Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes). AcGST- SfManIII is a recombinant baculovirus that encodes a GST-tagged, secreted form of SfManIII. Sf9 cells were infected with either this recombinant virus or a wild type control, and the extracellular media were harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-GST as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results revealed that there were two specifically immunoreactive proteins in the extracellular growth medium from the AcGST-SfManIII-infected cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Neither was detected in the medium from wild type virus-infected cells (data not shown). The major protein had an apparent molecular mass of ∼150 kDa suggesting that it is intact GST-SfManIII, which has a calculated molecular mass of 157.5 kDa. The other, relatively minor protein had an apparent molecular mass of ∼130 kDa and is probably a degradation product. Another, weakly immunoreactive protein of ∼68 kDa was also detected, but its presence in the negative controls (data not shown) indicated that it was not specific. Coomassie Blue staining revealed that the growth medium contained at least three proteins, including the 68-kDa protein, which were present in vast excess relative to the 150- and 130-kDa immunoreactive proteins (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Affinity chromatography on an immobilized glutathione column was used to isolate the extracellular immunoreactive proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The affinity column retained the specifically immunoreactive proteins detected in the growth medium (compare Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 4), but not the nonspecifically immunoreactive and non-immunoreactive proteins detected by Coomassie Blue staining (compare Fig. 1 B,lanes 1 and 4). About half of the α-mannosidase activity in the medium was retained by the column as determined by pNP-α-Man assays (data not shown). Multiple attempts to elute active GST-SfManIII from the column with reduced glutathione were unsuccessful, but the column-bound enzyme had high levels of pNP-α-Man activity (data not shown). Therefore, the immobilized glutathione-agarose beads were removed from the column, resuspended in buffer A, and used as the source of GST-SfManIII for this study. The bound GST-SfManIII retained its activity for at least 1 week at 4 °C but was inactivated by freezing. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel profile of an excess amount of the material extracted from the immobilized glutathione-agarose beads is shown in lane 5 of Fig. 1 B. This analysis revealed that the SfManIII preparations consisted of a major protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼150 kDa, a minor protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼130 kDa, and no other detectable proteins. Presumably, the two proteins stained by Coomassie Blue corresponded to those detected by immunoblotting. A series of enzyme assays was performed to characterize the biochemical properties of GST-SfManIII. One set of assays was designed to evaluate the influence of various metal ions on GST-SfManIII activity (TableI). The addition of 1 mm EDTA reduced hydrolysis of pNP-α-Man to less than 10% of control levels indicating that GST-SfManIII has a divalent cation requirement. Indeed, GST-SfManIII activity was greatly enhanced by the addition of CoCl2 and, to a lesser extent, MnCl2. NiCl2 had little effect, and GST-SfManIII activity was inhibited by ZnCl2. The effect of calcium was not examined because TNM-FH and Grace's media contain high concentrations of CaCl2.Table IInfluence of metal ions on GST-SFMANIII activitySupplement1 mm0.1 mm0.01 mm%%%None100EDTA8.9CoCl22340.73019.1858MnCl2605.8148.698ZnCl28.321.844NiCl2116.7119.5108pNP-α-Man assays were performed in the presence of the indicated supplements, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity levels are expressed as percentages of the level measured in control assays containing no supplements. Open table in a new tab pNP-α-Man assays were performed in the presence of the indicated supplements, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity levels are expressed as percentages of the level measured in control assays containing no supplements. Another set of assays was performed to examine the influence of pH on GST-SfManIII activity against pNP-α-Man in the presence of 1 mm CoCl2 (Fig.2). GST-SfManIII activity was negligible at pH 5.5, increased at pH 5.7 and 5.9, decreased at pH 6.1, and finally rose to a plateau at pH 6.5–6.7. These data showed that GST-SfManIII had significantly more activity around neutral pH than at acidic pH, which is consistent with the idea that it is a processing, not a lysosomal, enzyme. The reason for the reproducible decline in activity observed at pH 6.1 is unknown. Finally, a set of pNP-α-Man assays was performed to determine the effect of swainsonine on GST-SfManIII activity (Fig. 3). GST-SfManIII was clearly sensitive to swainsonine in assays performed at pH 6.3 in the presence of 1 mm CoCl2. The IC50was ∼10 nm, and 1.5 μm swainsonine reduced GST-SfManIII activity to less than 0.5% of control values. Thus, GST-SfManIII shares some biochemical properties with Golgi α-mannosidase II including its neutral pH optimum and swainsonine sensitivity, but its dependence on cobalt clearly distinguishes this enzyme from Golgi α-mannosidase II. Whereas it was well established that Golgi α-mannosidase II hydrolyzes GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 to GlcNAcMan3GlcNAc2 (2Moremen K.W. Trimble R.G. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the natural substrate specificity of SfManIII had not been determined. Therefore, experiments were undertaken to examine the action of GST-SfManIII on various glycan substrates. GST-SfManIII had little effect on GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2-PA even after extended incubation times (Fig. 4). Thus, GST-SfManIII failed to hydrolyze the natural substrate of Golgi α-mannosidase II. On the other hand, GST-SfManIII effectively hydrolyzed Man5GlcNAc2-PA through a Man4GlcNAc2-PA intermediate to Man3GlcNAc2-PA (Fig.5). This activity was not due to contamination with endogenous α-mannosidases as there was no detectable hydrolysis when Man5GlcNAc2-PA was incubated for 72 h with a mock affinity-purified enzyme preparation from wild type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Fig.5, Mock). Thus, GST-SfManIII can hydrolyze the proposed substrate for α-mannosidase III, the enzyme thought to mediate the alternate N-glycan processing pathway in mice (6Chui D. Oh-Eda M. Liao Y.F. Panneerselvam K. Lal A. Marek K.W. Freeze H.H. Moremen K.W. Fukuda M.N. Marth J.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).Figure 5Action of GST-SfManIII on Man5GlcNAc2.Man5GlcNAc2-PA (top right) was incubated for the indicated times with GST-SfManIII, and the oligosaccharide products were analyzed by HPLC (left-hand panels) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thepanel on the bottom right shows the results of a control reaction in which Man5GlcNAc2-PA was incubated for 72 h with a mock-purified enzyme preparation made from cells infected with wild type baculovirus. The arrows mark the positions of glycan standards. M5 to M2 refer to Man(5–2)GlcNAc2-PA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Considering its unusual substrate specificity, we also evaluated the ability of GST-SfManIII to hydrolyze other glycans, which had terminal α1,2-linked mannose residues (Fig. 6). GST-SfManIII was incubated for 72 h with Man9GlcNAc2-PA, Man8GlcNAc2-PA (mixed isomers) or Man6GlcNAc2-PA (isomer C with one α1,2-linked mannose residue on the middle arm). Over half of the Man9GlcNAc2-PA was consumed producing Man8GlcNAc2-PA and a small amount of Man7GlcNAc2-PA. Similarly, most of the Man8GlcNAc2-PA was consumed producing Man7GlcNAc2-PA and small amounts of Man6GlcNAc2-PA and Man5GlcNAc2-PA. Finally, Man6GlcNAc2-PA was completely consumed producing mainly Man5GlcNAc2-PA and small amounts of Man4GlcNAc2-PA and Man3GlcNAc2-PA. None of these activities were due to contaminating endogenous α-mannosidases as there was no detectable hydrolysis of any of these substrates when they were incubated for 72 h with a mock affinity-purified enzyme preparation from wild type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Fig.6, Mock column). These results demonstrated that GST-SfManIII can hydrolyze a variety of glycan substrates containing terminal α1,2-linked mannose residues in addition to Man5GlcNAc2-PA. Interestingly, SfManIII produced much less Man7GlcNAc2-PA from the Man9GlcNAc2-PA substrate than from the Man8GlcNAc2-PA (mixed isomer) substrate. The reason why Man9GlcNAc2-PA was not completely converted to Man7GlcNAc2-PA is unclear. It is possible that this simply reflects the relatively slow conversion of Man9GlcNAc2-PA to Man8GlcNAc2-PA (Fig. 6, top left panel). Alternatively, it is possible that this reflects the composition of the Man8GlcNAc2-PA (mixed isomer) substrate, which consisted of ∼75% isomer A, 20% isomer B, and 5% isomer C (data not shown). This mixture might be a better substrate for SfManIII because isomers A and B are better substrates for SfManIII. In contrast, SfManIII digestion of Man9GlcNAc2-PA could yield a totally different mixture of Man8GlcNAc2-PA isomers, which is relatively resistant to further digestion by SfManIII. These possibilities were not examined in this study. All of the assays of GST-SfManIII activity against glycan substrates were performed in the presence of 1 mmCoCl2. Therefore, additional assays were performed to specifically evaluate the cobalt requirement for Man5GlcNAc2-PA hydrolysis by GST-SfManIII. Hydrolysis was greatly reduced when CoCl2 was not added to the assays and was completely abolished in the presence of 5 mm EDTA (data not shown) indicating that cobalt is required for the hydrolysis of Man5GlcNAc2-PA by GST-SfManIII. The effect of swainsonine on Man5GlcNAc2-PA hydrolysis by GST-SfManIII was also evaluated, and the results were similar to those obtained in the pNP-α-Man assays (data not shown) indicating that hydrolysis of Man5GlcNAc2-PA by GST-SfManIII is sensitive to swainsonine, as well. All of the properties of SfManIII were consistent with the interpretation that this enzyme plays a role in N-glycan processing in Sf9 cells. If SfManIII has this role in vivo, it should reside in the Golgi compartment. To examine its intracellular distribution, confocal microscopy was used to examine live Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus vector encoding a full-length, GFP-tagged version of SfManIII. This baculovirus expression vector expresses SfManIII-GFP under the transcriptional control of a baculovirus promoter that is active immediately after infection and provides relatively low expression levels (18Jarvis D.L. Weinkauf C. Guarino L.A. Protein. Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This promoter was used to circumvent the potential problem of aberrant localization of SfManIII-GFP, which might happen if it had been overexpressed. Sf9 cells were infected with this baculovirus for 18 h, and then labeled with the red fluorescent dyes BODIPY®TR ceramide to stain the Golgi (Fig. 7,top panels) or LysoTracker™ Red DND-99 to stain the lysosomes (Fig. 7, bottom panels). Confocal microscopy revealed that the SfManIII-GFP was localized in punctate fluorescent structures dispersed throughout the cytoplasm but excluded from the nuclei (Fig. 7, left panels). This staining pattern overlapped significantly with the pattern obtained with the Golgi dye (Fig. 7, top middle panel) but not with the pattern obtained with the lysosomal dye (Fig. 7, bottom middle panel). It is noteworthy that a previous study established the dispersed nature of the Golgi elements in Sf9 cells (19Kawar Z. Jarvis D.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the confocal microscopy results described above indicate that SfManIII is localized in the Golgi compartment of Sf9 cells. This study demonstrated that Sf9 cells encode a class II α-mannosidase that is distinct from Golgi α-mannosidase II and has a unique set of properties. Based on these properties, and in accordance with the nomenclature used by Chui et al.(6Chui D. Oh-Eda M. Liao Y.F. Panneerselvam K. Lal A. Marek K.W. Freeze H.H. Moremen K.W. Fukuda M.N. Marth J.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we named this enzyme SfManIII. Unlike Golgi α-mannosidase II, SfManIII is activated by cobalt, it can hydrolyze Man(9–5)GlcNAc2, and it can convert Man5GlcNAc2 to Man3GlcNAc2 but cannot hydrolyze GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2. On the other hand, SfManIII has the same neutral pH optimum and intracellular distribution as Golgi α-mannosidase II. These properties, together with the fact that Man3GlcNAc2 can be elongated byN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (20Schachter H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 21Altmann F. Kornfeld G. Dalik T. Staudacher E. Glossl J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and further processed to complex structures, suggest that SfManIII functions inN-glycan processing in Sf9 cells. However, the current study did not establish whether or not SfManIII actually plays this role in vivo. The early steps of N-glycan processing, including mannose trimming, appear to be similar or identical in Sf9 and mammalian cells (22Marz L. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Kubelka V. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins. 29a. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1995: 543-563Google Scholar, 23Jarvis D.L. Kawar Z.S. Hollister J.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a class I α-mannosidase has been cloned from Sf9 cells, and its product has been extensively characterized (19Kawar Z. Jarvis D.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Kawar Z. Herscovics A. Jarvis D.L. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Kawar Z. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Jarvis D.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The results of these studies have shown that SfManI is virtually identical in structure, function, and intracellular distribution to the mammalian α-mannosidases IA and IB. In addition, Sf9 cells have a class II α-mannosidase that acts on GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2 without a metal ion requirement and appears to be functionally identical to mammalian Golgi α-mannosidase II (26Ren J. Castellino F.J. Bretthauer R.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, whereas SfManIII has the biochemical properties of Class II mannosidases, a mammalian ortholog with similar catalytic characteristics has not yet been purified or cloned (5Moremen K.W. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P. Oligosaccharides in Chemistry and Biology: A Comprehensive Handbook. 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 81-117Google Scholar). Considering the similarities between the other processing α-mannosidases of Sf9 and mammalian cells, there is probably a mammalian ortholog of SfManIII as well. One likely candidate is the cobalt-activated α-mannosidase activity(ies) that convert Man5GlcNAc to Man3GlcNAc in null mice lacking Golgi α-mannosidase II (6Chui D. Oh-Eda M. Liao Y.F. Panneerselvam K. Lal A. Marek K.W. Freeze H.H. Moremen K.W. Fukuda M.N. Marth J.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 157-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This activity, termed α-mannosidase III, compensates for the absence of Golgi α-mannosidase II in these mice by providing an alternate pathway for N-glycan processing. However, it is currently impossible to unequivocally decipher the relationship between this activity and SfManIII because the mouse enzyme(s) that provide this activity have not yet been identified. In fact, several enzymes probably contribute to the α-mannosidase III activity detected in mouse cell lysates including both swainsonine-resistant enzymes that are not involved inN-glycan processing, as well as one or more swainsonine-sensitive, processing enzymes. One mammalian enzyme that could account for the Man5GlcNAc-hydrolyzing activity in the null mouse cell lysates is an α-mannosidase first characterized in BHK cells (27Monis E. Bonay P. Hughes R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and later purified from rat liver (28Bonay P. Hughes R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Bonay P. Roth J. Hughes R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This BHK/rat liver enzyme is cobalt-activated, relatively resistant to swainsonine, and can convert Man5GlcNAc2 to Man3GlcNAc2 but cannot hydrolyze pNP-α-Man. This enzyme does not appear to be a processing enzyme because there is no complex N-glycan biosynthesis in BHK cells treated with swainsonine (30Foddy L. Feeney J. Hughes R.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) indicating that all of the processing class II α-mannosidases in these cells are swainsonine sensitive. But, like the null mice discussed above, mutant BHK cells lacking detectable Golgi α-mannosidase II activity can still synthesize some complexN-glycans (31Hughes R.C. Feeney J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, these cells must have another, swainsonine sensitive α-mannosidase III activity that provides the alternate N-glycan processing pathway. A second mammalian enzyme that could account for the α-mannosidase III activity is an isozyme of Golgi α-mannosidase II that has been termed α-mannosidase IIx (32Misago M. Liao Y.F. Kudo S. Eto S. Mattei M.G. Moremen K.W. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11766-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This enzyme shares sequence similarity with both the human and insect class II α-mannosidases, but its N-glycan substrate specificity has not yet been characterized. There also is another group of mammalian enzymes, generally classified as ER/cytosolic α-mannosidases, which could account for the Man5GlcNAc-hydrolyzing activity detected in the null mouse cell lysates. These enzymes are activated by cobalt, are relatively resistant to swainsonine, and can convert Man5GlcNAc to Man3GlcNAc. However, they act efficiently only on glycans with a single GlcNAc residue on their reducing end and appear to function in N-glycan catabolism rather than processing (33Bischoff J. Moremen K.

(Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SfManIII is clearly distinct from both the swainsonine resistant BHK/rat liver enzyme and the ER/cytosolic α-mannosidases. SfManIII is sensitive to swainsonine, can hydrolyze pNP-α-Man, and can efficiently hydrolyze glycans with chitobiose cores. Considering these properties and the fact that Sf9 cells have another α-mannosidase, which is functionally equivalent to mammalian Golgi α-mannosidase II (26Ren J. Castellino F.J. Bretthauer R.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), SfManIII is probably equivalent to the enzyme providing the alternate pathway in the null mice (6Chui D. Oh-Eda M. Liao Y.F.

Biochem. 1986; 158: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, an unequivocal test of this hypothesis awaits purification of the mammalian enzyme(s) responsible for the α-mannosidase III activity.

In this report, we describe a testis zinc finger protein (Tzfp) that binds to the upstream flanking sequence of the Aie1 gene. The mouse Tzfp gene, mapped to chromosome 7 B2-B3, encodes a 465-amino acid transcription factor containing a conserved N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and three C-terminal PLZF-like C2H2 zinc fingers.

The central kinase domain of Aie1 revealed 46.8%, 59.2%, and 64.6% identity to that of Ipl1, aurora, and Eg2, respectively, but much less homology was found in the sequence outside the kinase domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that Aie1 kinase is specifically expressed in testis (1Tseng T.C. Chen S.H. Hsu Y.P. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and particularly in meiotic pachytene spermatocytes, thereby suggesting a possible role of Aie1 in spermatogenesis (2Hu H.-M.

DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and constitute a third type of aurora-related kinase (aurora-C). We previously isolated the gene encoding Aie1 and mapped it to mouse chromosome 7A2–A3 (2Hu H.-M. Chuang C.-K. Lee M.-J. Tseng T.-C. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Aie1 gene spans ∼14 kb1 and contains seven exons. RNA in situ hybridization indicated that the expression of the Aie1 transcript was restricted to meiotically active germ cells, with the highest levels detected in pachytene spermatocytes (2Hu H.-M. Chuang C.-K. Lee M.-J. Tseng T.-C. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The biological function and the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Aie1 expression are poorly understood. Recently, we isolated a novel human PLZF-related transcription factor, designated as TZFP, which is predominantly expressed in testis (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The human TZFP contains a conserved N-terminal BTB (bric-a-brac, tramtrack, broad complex) or POZ (poxvirus, zinc finger) domain and three C-terminal PLZF-like C2H2 zinc fingers (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A computer search of the protein data base revealed that the zinc finger domain of TZFP is more closely related to the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, which was previously reported to be a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor (16Li J.Y. English M.A. Ball H.J. Yeyati P.L. Waxman S. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22447-22455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The biological function and the target genes regulated by TZFP remain largely unknown. In the present study, we isolated the mouse Tzfp gene and mapped it to chromosome 7 B2–B3. Interestingly, Tzfp binds directly to the upstream flanking sequence of the mouse Aie1 gene. We further demonstrated that the C-terminal zinc finger domain of Tzfp binds to a 10-bp element located at the putative Aie1promoter with high affinity and specificity. This is the first report to characterize the binding site for Tzfp and to suggest thatAie1 may be a candidate gene regulated by Tzfp. We previously isolated a full-length cDNA encoding human TZFP (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The BamHI cDNA fragment (nucleotides 882–1761) of human TZFP was used as a probe to screen a mouse testis cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The screening and cloning conditions were described previously (1Tseng T.C. Chen S.H. Hsu Y.P. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the DNA inserts was performed on both strands of the positive cDNA clones. The sequences of human TZFP and mouseTzfp were analyzed using the GCG software program of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package V9.1. The percentage of similarity between sequences was analyzed by the GAP program. The mouse cDNA fragment (∼1.7 kb) spanning two-thirds of the coding region of Tzfp was used as probe to screen a mouse 129/SvJ genomic BAC library (Genome System, St. Louis, MO). One positive BAC clone, 119/j1 (∼150 kb), was detected and isolated. The 119/j1 DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and the resulting DNA fragments were subcloned and sequenced as described previously (2Hu H.-M. Chuang C.-K. Lee M.-J. Tseng T.-C. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine the positions of the exons and the sequences of exon-intron boundaries, a series of sense or antisense primers derived from a previously defined sequence of Tzfp cDNA were used for sequence analysis of individual genomic DNA subclones. FISH was performed at the laboratory of Genome Systems, Inc., using a method previously described (2Hu H.-M. Chuang C.-K. Lee M.-J. Tseng T.-C. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mouse Tzfp DNA (∼150 kb) isolated from the BAC clone (119/j1) was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. Metaphase chromosomes prepared from mouse embryo fibroblast cells were hybridized with the labeled DNA probe and sheared mouse DNA. The hybridization signals were detected using anti-digoxigenin antibodies, and mouse chromosomes were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole. TheBamHI cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal zinc finger domain (residues 271–465) of mouse Tzfp (Tzfp-ZF) was inserted in-frame into a pGEX-3X expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST)/Tzfp-ZF fusion proteins. Overexpression and affinity purification of GST fusion proteins were performed as previously described (17Tang C.J. Tang T.K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragment used for EMSA was PCR amplified from the upstream flanking sequence (UFS) of the mouse Aie1 gene using a primer set, 103pF4 and 103pR1 (see Fig. 4 B). This PCR-amplified fragment was then subcloned into a PCRII vector. Two DNA fragments, UFS1 and UFS2 (see Fig. 4 B), which were generated by EcoRI and PstI digestion of the originally PCR-amplified DNA in the PCRII vector, were treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments with (UFS2) or without (UFS1) the Tzfp binding site (tbs) were then purified by a push column and used as target probes for EMSA. EMSA was carried out by incubating the GST/Tzfp-ZF with32P-labeled UFS1 or UFS2 (∼20,000 cpm) in EMSA buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol. After 20-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel (see Fig.5 A). For antibody supershift assays (see Fig.5 B), the appropriate antiserum was added to the reaction mixture 20 min after the addition of the probe. Polyclonal antibodies against Tzfp were raised in rabbits as previously described (18Hung L.Y. Tang C.J. Tang T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7813-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For the EMSA competition assay (see Fig. 7), unlabeled oligo-DNA competitors (in 0 to 800-fold molar excess) were preincubated with GST/Tzfp-ZF for 20 min on ice, followed by the addition of labeled UFS1 or UFS2 probes and incubation on ice for 20 min. The resulting DNA·protein complexes were separated on a polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel as described above. The oligonucleotide competitors used in the EMSA competition were: oligo-N, 5′-GATCCAAAAATATGTACAGTGTTATG-3“ and 3′-G TT TTTATACATGTCACAATACCTAG-5′; oligo-M1, 5′-GATCCAAAAATATGTAAAGTGTTATG-3′ and 3′-GTTTTTATACATTTCACAATACCTAG-5′; oligo-M2, 5′-GATCCAAAACGATGTACAGTGTTATG-3′ and 3′-GTTTTGCTACATGTCACAATACCTAG-5′; oligo-M3, 5′-GATCCAAAAATATGTACAGTTTTATG-3′ and 3′-GTTTTTATACATGTCAAAATACCTAG-5′; oligo-M4, 5′-GATCCAAAAATATGTACATTGTTATG-3′ and 3′-GTTTTTATACATGTAACAATACCTAG-5′. ThePstI-EcoRI fragment of UFS2 containing thetbs sequence (see Fig. 4) was labeled at theEcoRI site using the Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP. The probe was incubated with GST or GST/Tzfp-ZF in EMSA buffer. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, RNase-free DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) was added for 1 min at room temperature. The reaction was then stopped by addition of a stop solution containing 200 mm NaCl, 30 mmEDTA, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel. Sequencing lanes of the same probe were generated by the Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Inc., Piscataway, NJ) and Maxam-Gilbert procedures (19Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). To test the DNA binding activity of Tzfp in transfected cells (see Fig. 8), the FLAG-tagged cDNA spanning the entire coding region of mouse Tzfp was subcloned into a CAGGS expression vector, which was driven by a chicken β-actin promoter. The resulting plasmid (FLAG-Tzfp) was transfected into human 293 cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line). Forty-eight hours after transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected or nontransfected cells as previously described (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). For EMSA, 2 μg of nuclear extracts and32P-labeled oligo-N probes were incubated in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 20 min. The Tzfp·DNA binding complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For competition assays (see Fig. 8), unlabeled oligo-N or oligo-M1 competitor (in 0 to 1000-fold molar excess) were preincubated with the nuclear extracts and analyzed as described above. To examine the transactivation properties of VP/Tzfp-ZF hybrids in transfected cells (see Fig. 9), the BamHI-XbaI DNA fragment that covers the entire three zinc fingers (residues 271–465) of mouse Tzfp was fused in-frame into the C terminus of HSV VP16 activation domain in a pVP16 plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA); the resulting vector was designated as pVP-Tzfp-ZF. Oligonucleotides containing one to seven copies of the Tzfp binding site (tbs) were cloned into a pG5CAT reporter plasmid (CLONTECH) in which the five GAL4 binding sites had been replaced with Oligo-N; the resulting plasmid was designated as pTbsCAT (see Fig. 9). The pTbs7MCAT mutant plasmid was constructed by insertion of seven copies of oligo-M1 (in which the fifth C had been mutated to A at the tbs) upstream of the E1b promoter (see Fig.9 A). To examine the repression activity of Gal4/TZFP-N hybrids in transfected cells (see Fig. 9 B), the cDNA fragment that spans the N-terminal BTB/POZ domain (residues 1–373) of human TZFP was fused in-frame into the C terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in a pM vector (CLONTECH); the resulting vector was named pM-TZFP-N. The reporter plasmid, pGal4TK-Luc, carries five copies of the Gal4 binding site before the TK promoter, driving a luciferase reporter gene. The transient transfection assay was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) as previously described (18Hung L.Y. Tang C.J. Tang T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7813-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, human 293 or mouse testis sertoli TM4 cells (3 × 105 cells/35-mm culture dish) were transfected with reporter (0.6 μg) and expression (0.6 μg) plasmids as indicated below in Fig. 9 along with 0.05 μg of a β-galactosidase internal control plasmid. At 48 h post-transfection, cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (CAT ELISA kit), and aliquots were normalized for transfection efficiency by assay of β-galactosidase activity (Promega). The CAT and luciferase activity were analyzed by a CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and a luciferase assay system (Promega), respectively. Transfection was performed in duplicate for each experiment, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. We previously isolated a novel human zinc finger protein, TZFP (testis zinc finger protein), which is predominantly expressed in testis (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To further investigate the molecular features and biological functions of TZFP, theBamHI cDNA fragment of human TZFP encoding all three zinc finger domains was used as a probe to screen a mouse testis cDNA library (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several positive clones were obtained. Compiling all the sequences from cDNA as well as from genomic clones (described below), a full-length cDNA was assembled that encodes a 465-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of ∼51 kDa. Comparative amino acid analysis between mouse Tzfp and human TZFP revealed 73% identity and 75% similarity (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the highest conserved regions between mouse and human TZFP were restricted in the N-terminal BTB/POZ domain (80% identity) and the C-terminal zinc fingers (97% identity). Using the mouse Tzfp cDNA as a probe, a positive BAC clone (119/j1; ∼150 kb) was isolated from a mouse 129/SvJ genomic library. The 119/j1 DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and the resulting DNA fragments were subcloned and sequenced. The assembled DNA sequence (9377 bp) that spans the entire coding region and part of the 5′ upstream flanking sequence of mouseTzfp gene was deposited in GenBank™ under accession numberAY015272. The precise locations of individual exons and the sequences of each exon-intron junction were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures”. The restriction enzyme map and genomic organization of the mouse Tzfp gene are shown in Fig.2. The mouse Tzfp gene spans ∼10 kilobases long and contains at least six exons, which are interrupted by five introns. The donor and acceptor splice site sequences match the consensus sequences for the exon-intron boundaries of most eukaryotic genes (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, three C2H2 zinc fingers located at the C terminus of Tzfp are encoded by two separated exons. The first zinc finger is encoded by exon 5, whereas the second and the third zinc fingers are encoded by exon 6. The BTB/POZ domain of Tzfp is encoded by exon 2. The chromosomal localization of the mouse Tzfp locus was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A total of 80 metaphase cells were analyzed with 69 exhibiting specific labeling. On the basis of FISH analysis, Tzfp appears to be located on mouse chromosome 7. To more specifically define the chromosome location, a second probe specific for the telomeric region of chromosome 7 was cohybridized with the Tzfp clone (119/j1). As shown in Fig.3, positive signals were detected at the telomere as well as at the proximal portion of chromosome 7. Measurements of specifically labeled chromosome 7 indicated thatTzfp is located at a position corresponding to band 7 B2–B3. The high degree of sequence homology between the zinc finger domains of TZFP and PLZF suggests that TZFP may also bind to the cognate binding site of PLZF with a core consensus sequence (A(T/G)(G/C)T(A/C)(A/C)AGT) (16Li J.Y.

Interestingly, this core consensus motif (ATGTACAGT) and a putative TATA box were also found in the upstream flanking sequence (UFS) of the Aie1gene (Fig. 4 B; GenBank™ accession number AF195272 (2Hu H.-M. Chuang C.-K. Lee M.-J. Tseng T.-C. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). We previously reported that Aie1 (aurora-C) is a novel testis-specific serine/threonine kinase belonging to a growing aurora/Ipl1 kinase family (1Tseng T.C. Chen S.H. Hsu Y.P. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the C-terminal zinc finger domain of Tzfp (Tzfp-ZF) binds directly to the UFS of the Aie1 gene, we performed a gel mobility shift assay using the purified recombinant GST/Tzfp-ZF proteins and two PCR-amplified fragments (UFS1 and UFS2) derived from the UFS region of the Aie1 gene (Fig.4 B). Incubation of GST/Tzfp-ZF with the UFS2 region containing the core motif resulted in the formation of DNA·protein complexes (C1 and C2) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A, lanes 2–4). In contrast, GST/Tzfp-ZF did not bind to UFS1, which lacks this core motif (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–8). Similar results were obtained when the C-terminal zinc finger domain of human TZFP was incubated with UFS2 (data not shown). The C1 and C2 complexes were competed away by adding an excess amount of the unlabeled UFS2 but not by an unrelated UFS1, showing that this binding was specific (data not shown). The direct interaction between Tzfp-ZF and UFS2 was further confirmed by an antibody-induced super shift experiment. As shown in Fig. 5 B, we detected a super-shift complex in the experimental reactions containing GST/Tzfp-ZF, UFS2, and anti-Tzfp antibody (5B, lanes 3–5). In contrast, no such complex was detected in the presence of increasing amounts of control antibody (5B, lanes 6–8). Taken together, these results indicate that the C-terminal zinc finger domain of Tzfp binds to a target sequence located at the UFS2 region of the Aie1gene. To define the target sequence of Aie1 that interacts with Tzfp, DNase I footprint analysis was performed. Fig. 6 shows that recombinant GST/Tzfp-ZF bound to a defined sequence (5′-TGTACAGTGT-3′), here termed tbs (Tzfp binding site), located at the UFS2 region of the Aie1 gene (lanes 2 and3). The same UFS2 region was not protected by control GST proteins (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 5). Furthermore, a ubiquitous footprint protected region that contains an A-rich sequence located just before the tbs (6A) was present in all lanes (Fig. 6 B) and was possibly generated by a nonspecific protection due to unknown reasons. This footprint region was found in all control experiments (6B, lanes 4and 5), even in the absence of recombinant proteins (Fig.6 B, lane 1). To more precisely define the essential nucleotides of tbsfor Tzfp binding, we synthesized four mutant oligonucleotides, M1 to M4 (see “Experimental Procedures”; Fig. 6 A), and used them as unlabeled competitors in a gel mobility shift assay. Fig.7 shows that oligo-M1 and oligo-M4, which contain a C → A and a G→T substitution, respectively (Fig.6 A), were not able to compete with the UFS2 probe for Tzfp binding. By contrast, the DNA·protein complexes (C1) were easily competed away by the addition of excess normal (oligo-N; Fig. 7) or two other mutant oligonucleotides (oligo-M2 and oligo-M3; Fig. 7). Taken together, we defined the target sequence (tbs), TGTACAGTGT, for Tzfp and identified that the fifth C and seventh G residues within the tbs are important for interacting with the C-terminal zinc finger domain of Tzfp. To determine whether the entire Tzfp molecule, including both the BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains also exhibit sequence-specific binding, we transfected the FLAG-tagged full-length Tzfp cDNA into 293 cells. Nuclear extracts prepared from transfected or mock-transfected cells were incubated with a 32P-labeled oligo-N probe carrying a wild type tbs motif. As shown in Fig.8, the Tzfp-DNA binding complexes were detected in the transfected nuclear extracts (lanes 2 and7). However, no such complexes were detected in the reactions with or without the addition of mock-transfected extracts (lanes 1 and 6; data not shown). Furthermore, the Tzfp-DNA binding complexes were competed away by adding an excess amount of unlabeled oligo-N probes (lanes 3–5) but not by oligo-M1 probes in which the fifth C in the tbs sequence was changed to A (lanes 8–10). Taken together, these results further confirmed that Tzfp binds to the tbs site in a sequence-specific manner. To examine whether Tzfp is able to regulate transcription via interaction with the tbs site in mammalian cells, we constructed a reporter plasmid (pTbsCAT) in which the CATgene is driven by an E1b promoter with one to seven copies of thetbs inserted upstream of the promoter (Fig.9 A). The TM4 cells were cotransfected with the pTbsCAT reporter plasmid and a pVP-Tzfp-ZF expression plasmid in which the C-terminal zinc finger domain of mouse Tzfp was fused with the transcription activation domain of HSV VP16 protein. As shown in Fig. 9 A, significant transactivation of the CAT reporter gene was observed in transfected cells in atbs copy number-dependent manner. Cotransfection of the pTbs7MCAT plasmid, which contains seven copies of a mutated tbs, had no effect on activity, demonstrating that this activation was specific. In contrast, no CAT activity was detected in negative control cells, which had previously been cotransfected with pVP16 and pTbsCAT containing various copies of the tbs. These results indicate that the Tzfp zinc-finger domain, when fused to a heterologous transactivation domain, may act as a specific transcriptional transactivator in mammalian cells. To determine the biological function of the BTB/POZ domain, we fused the N-terminal BTB/POZ domain of human TZFP into the C terminus of Gal4 DNA-binding domain in a pM vector. The resulting construct (pM-TZFP-N) was cotransfected with a reporter DNA (pGal4TK-Luc) carrying the luciferase gene linked to a TK promoter containing five copies of a Gal4 binding site into 293 cells. Fig.9 B shows that TZFP-N significantly repressed expression of this reporter gene, but not the parental tk-luciferase reporter (pTK-Luc). The vector (pM) alone did not affect the expression of the pGal4TK-Luc reporter gene. These results suggest that the N-terminal BTB/POZ domain of TZFP possesses a repressor activity. Using human TZFP cDNA as a probe, we isolated the mouse homologue (Tzfp) of human TZFP from a testis cDNA library. Both TZFP and Tzfp carry a conserved N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and three C-terminal PLZF-like C2H2 zinc fingers. The predicted amino acid sequences of the BTB/POZ domain and the zinc finger domain of TZFP revealed high homology with those of PLZF (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, two novel PLZF-like transcription factors, FAZF (21Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ROG (22Miaw S.C. Choi A., Yu, E. Kishikawa H. Ho I.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 323-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), were isolated from a human and a mouse lymphocyte cDNA library. Interestingly, our human TZFP (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and mouse Tzfp (this report) showed identical amino acid sequences with that of FAZF (Fanconi anemia zinc finger) and ROG (repressor of GATA), respectively. FAZF was reported to be a BTB/POZ transcriptional factor that interacts with the Fanconi anemia group C protein (21Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ROG was demonstrated to be a GATA-3-interacting protein, which might play a role in regulating the differentiation and activation of helper T (Th) cells (22Miaw S.C. Choi A., Yu, E. Kishikawa H. Ho I.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 323-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the TZFP/FAZF/ROG transcript is dominantly expressed in testis (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 323-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and is rapidly induced in Th cells upon stimulation with anti-CD3 (22Miaw S.C. Choi A., Yu, E. Kishikawa H. Ho I.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 323-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), however, the nature of target genes for TZFP/FAZF/ROG remain largely unknown. In this report, we define the binding sequence for Tzfp and describe for the first time a candidate target gene (Aie1) for Tzfp. The PLZF gene encodes a Kruppel-like transcription factor containing nine C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers and a conserved N-terminal BTB/POZ domain involved in protein·protein interactions (23Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Recently, Li et al. (16Li J.Y. English M.A. Ball H.J. Yeyati P.L. Waxman S. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22447-22455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) proposed a potential binding motif (A(T/G)(G/C)T(A/C)(A/C)AGT) for PLZF on the basis of sequence comparison. A similar motif was also found in the upstream flanking sequence of our Aie1 gene (Fig. 4). Because the zinc finger domain of Tzfp revealed high sequence homology with that of PLZF and both Tzfp and Aie1 are dominantly expressed in testis, these observations suggest the possibility that Aie1 may serve as a candidate target gene for Tzfp. In this study, we found that the zinc finger domain of Tzfp exhibits sequence-specific binding to a 10-bp DNA element (tbs) located at the upstream flanking sequence of the Aie1 gene. DNase I footprinting analysis defined the tbs binding site, 5′-TGTACAGTGT-3′ (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the GTACAGT sequence starting from the nucleotide position 2–8 of the tbs (here termedtbs core motif) was 100% identical to the sequences located at the lex A operator, as well as at the IL-3 receptor (IL-3R) promoter (Fig. 4 C). Based on sequence identity, it is reasonable to speculate that Tzfp may also bind to the lex A operator and the IL-3Rpromoter. Indeed, our unpublished data 2C.-J. C. Tang, C.-K. Chuang, H.-M. Hu, and T. K. Tang, unpublished data. showed that Tzfp binds to the lex A operator, and Hoatlin et al. (21Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that FAZF binds to the IL-3R promoter core sequence. Furthermore, our competition analyses demonstrated that the fifth C and seventh G of tbs sites are important residues for interacting with the C-terminal zinc finger domain of Tzfp (Fig.7). Taken together, we conclude that this 7-bp DNA element (GTACAGT) is a tbs core motif, which acts as the target sequence for Tzfp binding. The PLZF target gene reported so far is cyclin A2. The humancyclin A2 promoter has two potential binding sites for PLZF, a distal site (5′-AGCTAAAGG-3′) and a proximal site (5′-ACGTCAAGG-3′), which are located at nucleotides −342 and −75, respectively, 5′ to the major transcription initiation site (24Yeyati P.L. Shaknovich R. Boterashvili S. Li J. Ball H.J. Waxman S. Nason-Burchenal K. Dmitrovsky E. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). No such tbscore motif was found in the cyclin A2 promoter. Although the sequences of these two sites are not identical, PLZF can specifically bind to two sites within the cyclin A2 promoter and repress the promoter activity (24Yeyati P.L. Shaknovich R. Boterashvili S. Li J. Ball H.J. Waxman S. Nason-Burchenal K. Dmitrovsky E. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PLZF not only can bind to the cyclin A2 promoter, but also to the lex A operator (25Sitterlin D. Tiollais P. Transy C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, no sequence-specific motifs were found. The lack of a dominant consensus for a zinc finger protein is not a surprise. For example, the WT1 zinc finger protein binds to two DNA sequences that have little in common (26Rauscher F.J. d. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 27Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Enger K.T. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8896-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Similarly, PLZF recognizes many sequences with a less conserved core motif. This could be partially attributed to the fact that PLZF recognizes different DNA sequences by utilizing various subsets of its nine zinc finger motifs. In our current study, we found that Tzfp binds to the tbs located at the upstream flanking sequence of theAie1 gene. This binding is sequence-specific as evidenced by gel mobility shift (Fig. 5), DNA footprinting (Fig. 6), and competitive gel mobility shift (Fig. 7) assays. Because the zinc finger domains of Tzfp and PLZF share high amino acid identities and both bind to thelex A operator,2 it may be of considerable interest to examine the binding ability and transcriptional regulation of Tzfp to the cyclin A2 promoter. Recent studies showed that the N-terminal POZ domain of PLZF mediates its binding to several nuclear corepressors (including SMRT, mSin3A, and HDAC1) and represses gene transcription (28David G. Alland L. Hong S.H. Wong C.W. DePinho R.A. Dejean A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2549-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 29Hong S.H. David G. Wong C.W. Dejean A. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9028-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Like PLZF, human TZFP is localized to the nucleus2 and contains a BTB/POZ domain. Transient transfection experiments showed that TZFP may act as a transcriptional repressor when the N-terminal domain (residues 1–373) of human TZFP is tethered to a heterologous DNA-binding domain of Gal4 protein (Fig. 9 B). The presence of a BTB/POZ domain in TZFP suggests that TZFP may repress gene transcription via a common repression pathway similar to that found in PLZF, e.g. by recruiting nuclear corepressor SMRT and the histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Recently, Miaw et al. (22Miaw S.C. Choi A., Yu, E. Kishikawa H. Ho I.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 323-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) reported that ROG, which shows identical sequence to our Tzfp, is a repressor of GATA-3-induced transactivation. Interestingly, the repressor activity of ROG did not appear to occur through the recruitment of the SMRT·HDAC complex, because the addition of Trichostatin A (a potent inhibitor of HDAC), even at a concentration as high as 1000 nm, did not inhibit ROG repressor activity. Although both PLZF and ROG/Tzfp proteins exhibit a repressor activity, the differential ability in the recruitment of the SMRT·HDAC complex between the BTB/POZ domain of PLZF and ROG/Tzfp is an interesting topic worthy of further analysis. The WT1 tumor suppressor transcript is a subject of alternative splicing. One alternative spliced form of WT1 with a 17-amino acid insertion N-terminal to the zinc finger domain binds to the EGR1/WT1 site (30Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), whereas another form, which contains a 3-amino acid insertion between zinc fingers 3 and 4 of the protein, binds to a sequence distinct from the EGR1/WT1 site (31Bickmore W.A. Oghene K. Little M.H. Seawright A. van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Science. 1992; 257: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, multiple isoforms of TZFP/Tzfp with diverse structures were also identified in mammalian cells (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An alternative spliced form of mouse Tzfp without the BTB/POZ domain was also identified in mouse testis.2Because most proteins that carry the BTB/POZ domain possess a transcription repressor activity, this short isoform may play a role different from that of the large isoform. The differential functions of these diverse Tzfp isoforms need to be further analyzed. Finally, the interaction between Tzfp and the target genes carrying thetbs core sequence may also occur in cell types other than testis. Although TZFP (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Aie1 (1Tseng T.C. Chen S.H. Hsu Y.P. Tang T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) transcripts are predominantly expressed in testis, some TZFP transcripts have been detected in ovarian tumors, gastric cancer cells (15Lin W. Lai C.H. Tang C.J. Huang C.J. Tang T.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and activated lymphocytes (22Miaw S.C. Choi A., Yu, E. Kishikawa H. Ho I.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 323-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The observations that the expression of TZFP is not restricted to testis and that the BTB/POZ domain of PLZF is involved in protein·protein interaction and corepressors recruitment raise the possibility that multiple TZFP isoforms may play different roles in different cell types. In summary, we have isolated and characterized the gene structure, chromosome localization, and the DNA binding property of Tzfp, a novel PLZF-like transcription factor. Our results show that Tzfp binds specifically to the tbs site located at the upstream flanking sequence of the Aie1 gene, suggesting that Tzfp may regulate the expression the gene carrying tbs. We thank Dr. Jiann-Shiun Lai for providing the expressing vector (pGal4TK-Luc) and Dr. I.-Cheng Ho for providing the ROG sequence information."
https://openalex.org/W1999026988,"Two classes of cystathionine β-synthases have been identified in eukaryotes, the heme-independent enzyme found in yeast and the heme-dependent form found in mammals. Both classes of enzymes catalyze a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to produce cystathionine. The role of the heme in the human enzyme and its location relative to the PLP in the active site are unknown.31P NMR spectroscopy revealed that spin-lattice relaxation rates of the phosphorus nucleus in PLP are similar in both the paramagnetic ferric (T1 = 6.34 ± 0.01 s) and the diamagnetic ferrous (T1 = 5.04 ± 0.06 s) enzyme, suggesting that the two cofactors are not proximal to each other. This is also supported by pulsed EPR studies that do not provide any evidence for strong or weak coupling between the phosphorus nucleus and the ferric iron. However, the 31P signal in the reduced enzyme moved from 5.4 to 2.2 ppm, and the line width decreased from 73 to 16 Hz, providing the first structural evidence for transmission to the active site of an oxidation state change in the heme pocket. These results are consistent with a regulatory role for the heme as suggested by previous biochemical studies from our laboratory. The 31P chemical shifts of the resting forms of the yeast and human enzymes are similar, suggesting that despite the difference in their heme content, the microenvironment of the PLP is similar in the two enzymes. The addition of the substrate, serine, resulted in an upfield shift of the phosphorus resonance in both enzymes, signaling formation of reaction intermediates. The resting enzyme spectra were recovered following addition of excess homocysteine, indicating that both enzymes retained catalytic activity during the course of the NMR experiment.

Cystathionine β-synthase catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine in a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP1)-dependent reaction. The mammalian enzyme is novel in its dependence on a second cofactor, heme, which distinguishes it from all other members of the PLP family of enzymes in which this combination of cofactors is not seen (1Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the mammalian enzyme is allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (2Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Martin J.J. Pick A.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), a regulatory feature that is lacking in the related yeast enzyme (3Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11541-11544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reaction is postulated to involve a series of PLP-bound intermediates that are analogous to other PLP enzymes that catalyze β-replacement reactions (Fig. 1). Thus, the addition of serine results in a transaldimination reaction in which the Schiff base-forming lysine in the internal aldimine is replaced by serine to form the external aldimine. Binding of the second substrate, homocysteine, is followed by abstraction of the α-proton of serine and β-elimination of water to form the α-aminoacrylate intermediate, which is poised for nucleophilic addition by the thiolate of homocysteine. A second transaldimination reaction results in product release and regeneration of the resting enzyme. Fluorescence spectroscopy provides evidence for this scheme (4Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Formation of the aminoacrylate species in the ternary rather than the binary complex is supported by a very low level of tritium washout from the α-carbon of serine in the absence of homocysteine and a significant enhancement of this exchange in the presence of homocysteine (6Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, the yeast enzyme appears to utilize a ping-pong mechanism, and the α-aminoacrylate intermediate is observed in the presence of serine (7Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the N-terminal domain of cystathionine β-synthase revealed a phylogenetic relationship to a number of other PLP-dependent enzymes, notably O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, tryptophan synthase, and threonine deaminase, and led to the assignment of the PLP binding pocket to the region extending between residues 68 and 209 in the human sequence (5Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The alignment of the yeast and human cystathionine β-synthases with conserved active site residues that interact with PLP in O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase indicates that the region of homology is in fact more extensive and extends between residues 85 and 350 in the human sequence (Fig. 2). This assignment is confirmed by the identification of Lys-119 as the residue involved in Schiff base formation with the PLP in the resting enzyme (8Kery V. Poneleit L. Meyer J.D. Manning M.C. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2710-2724Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Weak sequence similarity between a few hemeproteins and the central region of cystathionine β-synthase extending between residues 241 and 341 suggested that this region may be important in heme binding (5Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the recent recognition that the closely related yeast enzyme lacks heme as well as a 66-residue N-terminal extension suggests that the N terminus of the human enzyme is involved in heme binding. Resolution of the question of whether or not the central region is also involved in the architecture of the heme pocket in the tertiary structure awaits solution of the crystal structure of the protein. Regardless of the location of the heme binding domain along the primary sequence, the function of the heme in the reaction catalyzed by human cystathionine β-synthase is unknown. A catalytic function for heme had been proposed in which the thiolate of homocysteine is activated for nucleophilic attack by direct coordination with the heme replacing the endogenous cysteinate ligand (9Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, resonance Raman spectroscopy failed to provide evidence for this hypothesis (10Green E.L. Taoka S. Banerjee R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 459-463Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More recently, the generation of a heme-free enzyme in the crystalline state of the protein has permitted detection of PLP-bound intermediates that are formed in the presence of the two substrates (11Bruno S.

The heme-free enzyme is able to form the α-aminoacrylate species in the presence of serine, and the internal aldimine was reformed when homocysteine was added, providing evidence for the ability of the enzyme to support catalysis in the absence of heme. These studies, along with the observation that the related heme-independent yeast enzyme catalyzes the same overall reaction with similar kinetic parameters, argue against an essential catalytic role for this cofactor in the human enzyme. Studies in our laboratory have revealed that perturbations in the heme environment influence the reaction catalyzed by human cystathionine β-synthase (4Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, reduction of the heme from the ferric to ferrous state is correlated with an ∼2-fold diminution in enzyme activity, whereas binding of CO to the ferrous enzyme results in complete inhibition of enzyme activity (4Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the heme in cystathionine β-synthase is likely to play a regulatory role and that changes in the heme pocket are transmitted to the active site where the PLP-dependent transformation of substrate to product occurs. In principle, NMR and pulsed EPR methods can be employed to probe interactions between the magnetic nucleus, 31P in PLP, and the paramagnetic ferric iron to map the distance between the two cofactors, PLP and heme. Relaxation of magnetic nuclei occurs because of the exchange of magnetic energy with the environment. Paramagnetic ions with unpaired electrons having a 658-fold greater magnetic moment than protons are effective in enhancing the relaxation process (12Mildvan A.S. Gupta R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 322-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Paramagnetic effects on the spin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2) relaxation rates can be evaluated by subtracting the relaxation rate measured in the presence of a diamagnetic center (e.g. ferrous heme in cystathionine β-synthase) and the corresponding paramagnetic state (ferric heme). This approach has been applied to map distances between magnetic nuclei and paramagnetic centers in a number of enzymatic systems (13Fung C.H. Feldmann R.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Makinen A.L. Nowak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12148-12157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second approach to determining distances between electronic and nuclear spins involves measurement of the hyperfine coupling between the two magnetic moments. Specifically the dipolar component of the coupling, which is anisotropic, varies in inverse proportion to the third power of the interspin distance. In cases where the overall hyperfine coupling is relatively large, it may be detected as a resolved splitting in the continuous wave EPR spectrum. More often, however, these splittings are obscured by inhomogeneous line-broadening effects, and one must resort to high resolution techniques such as ESEEM or ENDOR to obtain coupling constants. In both techniques a spectrum of transition energies of hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins is produced, and the orientation dependence of the hyperfine coupling yields the desired distance. Because the g-factor for low spin Fe3+ is anisotropic, determination of hyperfine couplings to magnetic nuclei of ligand atoms usually requires the use of high resolution EPR methods. In this study we employed a combination of NMR and pulsed EPR spectroscopic methods to evaluate the interaction, if any, between the heme and PLP cofactors in the human enzyme. Interestingly, whereas these studies do not provide evidence for coupling between the paramagnetic ferric ion and the phosphorus nucleus, they reveal that the heme oxidation state influences the microenvironment of the PLP and provides the first structural evidence for communication between the two cofactor binding sites. We have also compared the31P NMR spectra of the heme-independent yeast and heme-dependent human enzymes that lead us to conclude that the PLP environment is similar in the two proteins. Serine, ampicillin, TLCK, TPCK, leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, benzamidine and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. D2O (99%) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Homocysteine was generated from homocysteine thiolactone (Sigma) as described (15Drummond J.T. Jarrett J. Gonzalez J.C. Huang S. Matthews R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using Ellman's reagent (16Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20881) Google Scholar). Truncated human cystathionine β-synthase representing the active catalytic core of the enzyme was purified as described previously (5Taoka S. Widjaja L. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13155-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using an expression vector provided by Warren Kruger (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia). Full-length yeast cystathionine β-synthase was purified using a recombinant expression vector, pSEC, provided by Edith Miles (National Institutes of Health). Escherichia colicontaining the pSEC vector were cultured at 37 °C in 1 liter of super broth supplemented with 1 × Vogel and Bonner medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an OD650 of 2.1 as described previously (3Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11541-11544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 20 h and collected by centrifugation. The cell paste was suspended in 80 ml of buffer containing 50 mmTris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine-HCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm TLCK, 0.1 mm TPCK, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 ml/liter aprotinin, and 1 mg/liter pepstatin. The cells (∼12 g wet weight) were disrupted with a Heat Systems ultrasonic processor XL, operated at an output setting of 7 for 7 × 0.5 min with 3-min breaks between cycles to prevent overheating. The suspension was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 6 mg of lysozyme, 2 mg of DNase I, and 10 mm MgCl2 and then centrifuged at ∼12,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell wall debris and unbroken cells. The enzyme was purified by a modification of the reported procedure as described below. The supernatant was diluted 3-fold with distilled water and loaded onto a 5 × 7 cm fast flow hydroxylapatite column (from Calbiochem) equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PLP, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 mm TLCK, 0.1 mm TPCK, 1 ml/liter aprotinin, 2 mg/liter leupeptin, and 2 mg/liter pepstatin A. The column was washed with ∼300 ml of buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a 2-liter linear gradient ranging from 0–0.4 m KCl at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The enzyme was collected in two pools eluting between 0.05 and 0.12m KCl and 0.12 and 0.2 m KCl. The second fraction was ∼95% pure and was concentrated and stored at −80 °C. The first pool of enzyme was concentrated and loaded onto a second hydroxylapatite column (5 × 7 cm) equilibrated with buffer B, which differed from buffer A by containing 12.5 mm(instead of 50 mm) potassium phosphate, pH 7.8. The column was washed with 300 ml of buffer B and eluted with a 2-liter linear gradient of potassium phosphate ranging from 12.5 mmto 250 mm at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Highly pure enzyme eluted between 150 and 250 mm potassium phosphate and was concentrated and frozen at −80 °C. A total of 286 mg of yeast cystathionine β-synthase was obtained from a 1-liter culture and had a specific activity of 495 μmol/mg/h at 37 °C, which is comparable with the reported value (17Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fourier transform 31P NMR spectra were collected at 202.4 MHz on a GE-Omega 500-MHz spectrometer using a 10-mm multinuclear probe head with broadband 1H decoupling using a standard WALTZ-16 decoupler phase modulation scheme. The NMR tube contained the sample (1.8 ml) and D2O (0.2 ml) as field frequency lock and was maintained at 10 °C using a thermostated liquid nitrogen flow. A spectral width of 8298 Hz was acquired in 4096 complex data points with a pulse angle of 60°. Positive chemical shifts in ppm were reported versus 85% H3PO4. Chemical shift referencing was achieved by inserting a capillary containing 85% H3PO4into the sample and adding 4–8 additional transients to the accumulated spectrum. Spin-spin relaxation times (T 2) were determined using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spin-echo experiments, and the results were fitted to a 3-parameter exponential decay using a nonlinear regression algorithm. Spin-lattice relaxation times (T 1) were determined via progressive saturation using 90° excitation pulses with progressively shorter pulse-recycle delays until the signal was eliminated by saturation and the data were fit to the appropriate exponential decay function. The progressive saturation method was used rather than the more common inversion-recovery technique because of the sensitivity limitations of these samples. The spectrum of the reduced enzyme (Fig. 3 A) was acquired on a GE-Omega 300 instrument operating at 121.65 MHz for31P observation with 60° pulses. The substrates, serine and homocysteine, were added at the concentrations described in the figure legends. Pulsed ENDOR, ESEEM, and HYSCORE spectra were obtained using a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer. A Bruker Flexline variable-Q dielectric resonator with an integral radiofrequency coil for ENDOR was employed for pulsed measurements. Radiofrequency power was delivered by an ENI model A-500 amplifier with a 500-watt nominal full output. An Oxford Instruments CF935 liquid helium cryostat maintained samples at a constant temperature for measurement. All ESEEM data were obtained by the use of a stimulated echo pulse sequence (18Mims W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1972; B 5: 2409-2419Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). ESEEM experimental conditions were: sample temperature, 14 K; microwave frequency, 9.695 GHz; τ (delay between first and second microwave pulses), 200 ns; increment of T (delay between second and third microwave pulses), 16 ns; points per spectrum, 512; π/2 pulse duration, 16 ns; each point is the average of ∼5000 individual spin echoes. Each time domain ESEEM scan was fitted to a fourth-order polynomial function that was subtracted from the data set. Apodization with a trapezoid function, zero-filling to 1024 points, and calculation of the absolute-value Fourier transform yielded the final frequency domain spectrum. HYSCORE is a two-dimensional ESEEM method that helps to deconvolute complex spectra by revealing correlations between nuclear spin transition frequencies. For HYSCORE, the standard four-pulse sequence was used (19Hofer P. Grupp A. Nebenführ H. Mehring M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1986; 132: 279-282Crossref Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The 128 × 128 point data sets were base line corrected for ESEEM and processed by applying a two-dimensional fast Fourier transform. A Mims pulse sequence was used for all ENDOR measurements (20Mims W.B. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A. 1965; 283: 452-457Crossref Google Scholar). ENDOR experimental conditions were: sample temperature, 14 K; τ, 140–240 ns; T, 12 μs; radiofrequency pulse duration, 6.0 μs; microwave frequency, 9.695 GHz; magnetic field, 278.0 mT; pulse train repetition rate, 1.0 kHz; each point is the average of ∼2000 individual spin echoes. Spin-echo-detected EPR spectra were obtained by monitoring a two-pulse electron spin echo (τ = 140 ns) during a magnetic field scan. 31P NMR spectroscopy has been a useful tool for studying the environment of PLP bound in the active sites of enzymes. The chemical shift for PLP free in solution ranges from 0.75 to 4.3 ppm as the pH is increased from a low to high value (21Schnackerz K.D. Wahler G. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The low field resonances observed in the 31P NMR spectra of human (5.4 ppm) and yeast (5.17 ppm) cystathionine β-synthase suggests that the phosphate group of PLP is bound as a dianion in the active sites of both enzymes (Fig. 3). A similar chemical shift has been reported in the PLP enzyme,O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (5.2 ppm) (22Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.-H. Simmons J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12152-12160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A correlation between the 31P chemical shift and the smallest O–P–O bond angle has been reported by Gorenstein (23Gorenstein D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 898-900Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For free PLP in solution, the observed 31P chemical shift is presumed to arise from the minimal energy conformation of the phosphate. In human and yeast cystathionine β-synthases, the magnitude of the downfield chemical shifts for the bound PLP is greater than that for the free cofactor (4.3 ppm for the dianion) and suggests that the conformation of the phosphate moiety is strained. A resonance at an even lower field has been observed for PLP bound to ornithine decarboxylase (6.2 ppm) (24Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Rizo J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4558-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The broadness of the 31P signals in both yeast and human enzymes indicates that the PLP is bound tightly. The signal associated with the yeast enzyme is significantly broader than that of the human enzyme (73 Hz line width) because of the larger size of the protein (224 kDa versus 96 kDa for the truncated human protein), and its line width could not be estimated accurately. The similarity in the 31P NMR spectra of the yeast and oxidized human enzyme is consistent with the high degree of conservation in the PLP binding domains between the two enzymes at the primary sequence level (Fig. 2). To guide interpretation of our data, we have used the crystal structure of the Salmonella typhimurium O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase to develop a model for human cystathionine β-synthase by employing a molecular replacement strategy “in silico.” All the active site residues that interact with the PLP in the O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (25Burkhard P. Rao G.S. Hohenester E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) are completely conserved in both yeast and human cystathionine β-synthase (Fig. 2). Thus, the glycine-rich loop that is involved in electrostatic stabilization of the phosphate oxygen atoms, the serine that hydrogen-bonds with N1 of the PLP ring, and the asparagine that hydrogen-bonds to the 3′-hydroxyl group are present in all three enzymes (Fig. 4). The 5′-phosphate is likely to be dianionic in all three enzymes based on their respective chemical shifts. In O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, His-152 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to a water molecule that in turn hydrogen-bonds to the 5′-phosphate. It has been postulated that the histidine may be positively charged, resulting in near neutrality around the dianionic phosphate moiety (25Burkhard P. Rao G.S. Hohenester E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A similarly positioned histidine residue is observed in the modeled structure of cystathionine β-synthase (His-232 in the human sequence). Thus, the sequence alignments of the human and yeast cystathionine β-synthase and theO-acetylserine sulfhydrylase provide strong evidence for the conservation of the PLP binding site in the three enzymes and explain the similar 31P NMR chemical shifts observed in the resting forms of these enzymes. More importantly, these results indicate that the phosphorus group in PLP is shielded from the paramagnetic ferric heme in the human enzyme and that the two cofactors are not proximal to each other. We have employed ESEEM and pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy to determine whether or not the 31P nucleus of PLP is in the immediate vicinity of the ferric heme iron. Measurements were performed on three states of the enzyme, (i) the resting enzyme, (ii) the enzyme and homocysteine, and (iii) the enzyme, homocysteine, and serine. The ENDOR spectrum of the resting enzyme, obtained using the pulse sequence of Mims, exhibits a four-line pattern that is characteristic of heme nitrogen hyperfine couplings (Fig.5 a). None of the four lines tracked by magnetic field scan changed at the rate expected for31P, and none was altered upon addition of one or both substrates (Fig. 5 b). A weak 31P coupling should produce a pair of transitions positioned symmetrically about the Larmor frequency for that nucleus and positioned close to that frequency. In no case was a transition observed at or above the Larmor frequency of31P, except for 1H features well above 10 MHz. Thus, the ENDOR spectra show no evidence of the proximity of the31P nucleus to the heme and render unlikely its presence in the iron coordination sphere. Furthermore, substrate addition did not change the spin-echo-detected EPR spectrum (Fig. 5,inset showing a representative spectrum), again indicating that heme coordination by homocysteine is very unlikely. ESEEM spectra of the three forms of the enzyme are quite similar, containing modulation frequencies in a range generally associated with14N couplings (Fig. 6). One rather broad peak is consistently observed at just over 6.0 MHz, the31P Larmor frequency at an applied magnetic field of 350 mT. However, spectra obtained using the two-dimensional ESEEM technique, HYSCORE, revealed clearly that this feature is correlated with a transition at 2.5 MHz (data not shown). The observed correlation means that the 6.2- and 2.5-MHz transitions must arise from the same nucleus. For 31P at the field employed for HYSCORE of the resting enzyme (345.0 mT), the correlated partner transition should occur at 5.7 MHz and not at 2.5 MHz. Thus, the 6.2-MHz ESEEM feature is not due to 31P. As in the ENDOR and ESEEM studies, HYSCORE spectra exhibited no reproducible changes upon addition of substrate(s) to the enzyme. These results are consistent with resonance Raman data that failed to provide evidence for direct coordination of the thiolate of homocysteine to the heme in cystathionine β-synthase (10Green E.L. Taoka S. Banerjee R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 40: 459-463Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A change in the oxidation state of the heme from ferric to ferrous state diminishes the activity of cystathionine β-synthase by a factor of ∼2 (9Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Binding of CO to ferrous heme results in complete inhibition of cystathionine β-synthase activity, indicating that changes in the heme binding site are communicated to the active site containing PLP, and that the heme may play a regulatory role (4Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To provide structural evidence for this allosteric communication, we examined the 31P NMR spectrum of the ferrous enzyme. Reduction of cystathionine β-synthase results in conversion of the heme from a low spin paramagnetic ferric to a low spin diamagnetic ferrous state and is accompanied by significant changes in the 31P NMR spectrum of the bound PLP (Fig. 3). The phosphorus resonance shifts to higher field (from 5.4 to 2.2 ppm), and the signal is substantially narrowed (from 73 to 16 Hz). To exclude the possibility that the signal observed upon reduction of the heme is due to free PLP, the enzyme was subjected to filtration in a Centricon concentrator. Free PLP was not detected in the filtrate. In addition, the chemical shift of free PLP in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, is ∼4.3 ppm. The upfield shift in the resonance position is consistent with either a change in the ionization state of the phosphate group or a substantial change in the smallest O–P–O bond angle. The narrowing of the line width suggests that the phosphate group of PLP is more mobile and may be less tightly bound in the ferrous enzyme. To evaluate whether or not the longitudinal relaxation of the phosphorus nucleus is influenced by the presence of the paramagnetic ferric heme, the relaxation rates were determined by saturation recovery experiments and found to be 6.34 ± 0.01 s and 5.04 ± 0.06 s for the oxidized and reduced enzymes, respectively. The limiting values for the transverse relaxation rate,T 2, estimated from the spectral line widths, are 4.4 ms and 21.1 ms for the oxidized and reduced enzymes, respectively (the measured T 2 value using the spin echo technique for the oxidized enzyme is 2.8 ms). Because the presence of the paramagnetic ferric heme in the vicinity of PLP is expected to measurably enhance the spin relaxation rate of the phosphorus nucleus primarily by dipolar interactions between the ferric ion and the31P nucleus, the absence of a paramagnetic effect on the longitudinal relaxation rate indicates that the two cofactors are not proximal. Interestingly, these results reveal that whereas the heme is not sufficiently proximal to the PLP to affect theT 1 relaxation properties of the phosphorus nucleus, a change in the oxidation state is transmitted to the active site resulting in changes in the microenvironment of the PLP cofactor. This is manifested by significant alterations in the spectral line width (and T 2) and resonance frequency of the phosphorus signal. These results provide the first structural evidence for communication between the heme and the PLP binding sites and are consistent with functional studies from our laboratory that reveal that perturbations in the heme pocket affect catalytic activity (4Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PLP is bound as a Schiff base to Lys-119 in the active site of human cystathionine β-synthase (Fig. 1). The addition of the substrate, serine, results in fluorescent changes that are consistent with the formation of an external aldimine and the reported absence of tritium washout from the α carbon of serine in the absence of homocysteine. In the related enzymes tryptophan synthase (26Schnackerz K.D. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33247-33253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) andO-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (22Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.-H. Simmons J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12152-12160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the corresponding external aldimines rather than the elimination product, α-aminoacrylate, are also observed in the presence of serine alone. This is in contrast to the reported formation of the α-aminoacrylate product in heme-free cystathionine β-synthase in the crystalline state (11Bruno S. Schiarettti F. Burkhard P. Kraus J.P. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the presence of heme in the human enzyme affects the equilibrium between intermediates along the reaction coordinate and/or that the properties of the enzyme observed in the crystalline state are different from those observed for human cystathionine β-synthase in solution. The addition of 6 mm serine to 1.3 mmcystathionine β-synthase results in the appearance of a new signal at 4.7 ppm (Fig. 7). The smaller signal at 5.4 ppm corresponds to residual internal aldimine. The addition of 8 mm homocysteine to the sample containing the external aldimine results in reformation of the internal aldimine (at 5.4 ppm). This is expected because homocysteine was added in excess, and it establishes that the enzyme used in the NMR experiment remained catalytically active. The addition of serine to yeast cystathionine β-synthase results in the disappearance of the 412-nm absorption band assigned as the internal aldimine and in the appearance of a 460-nm band that is attributed to the α-aminoacrylate (7Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have examined the 31P NMR spectra of the enzyme in the presence of the two substrates, serine and homocysteine (Fig. 8). Addition of 4.8 mml-serine to the enzyme (1.2 mmin PLP) resulted in an upfield shift of the 5.15 ppm resonance to 4.07 ppm and was accompanied by a decrease in the line width. The latter suggests increased mobility, whereas the upfield shift in resonance frequency is consistent with an increase in the smallest O–P–O bond angle, resulting in increased shielding of the phosphorus nucleus (23Gorenstein D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 898-900Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The addition of 9.6 mmdl-homocysteine resulted in recovery of the resting enzyme spectrum. In this study, we employed a combination of NMR and pulsed EPR studies to detect possible interactions between the paramagnetic ferric iron and the phosphorus nucleus in PLP in human cystathionine β-synthase. The spectroscopic studies failed to show a direct coupling between the two nuclei and a paramagnetic effect on the relaxation rate of the phosphorus nucleus, thus supporting the conclusion that PLP and heme are not proximal in human cystathionine β-synthase. However, reduction of the heme in cystathionine β-synthase is accompanied by chemical shift and line width changes in the 31P signal, revealing that an oxidation state change in the heme pocket is transmitted to the active site, consistent with previous biochemical results from our laboratory that suggest a regulatory role for heme. The similarity in the 31P NMR spectra of the resting forms of yeast and human cystathionine β-synthase indicates that the PLP environment in the two enzymes are similar notwithstanding the absence of heme in the yeast enzyme. Furthermore, the addition of the substrate, serine, results in chemical shift changes that are consistent with the formation of the spectroscopically identified intermediates in the two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2089220034,"The selective recognition of pre-secretory proteins by SecA is essential to the process of protein export fromEscherichia coli, yet very little is known about the requirements for recognition and the mode of binding of precursors to SecA. The major reason for this is the lack of a soluble system suitable for biophysical study of the SecA-precursor complex. Complicating the development of such a system is the likelihood that SecA interacts with the precursor in a high affinity, productive manner only when it is activated by binding to membrane and SecYEG. A critical aspect of the precursor/SecA interaction is that it is regulated by various SecA ligands (nucleotide, lipid, SecYEG) to facilitate the release of the precursor, most likely in a stepwise fashion, for translocation. Several recent reports show that functions of SecA can be studied using separated domains. Using this approach, we have isolated a proteolytically generated N-terminal fragment of SecA, which is stably folded, has high ATPase activity, and represents an activated version of SecA. We report here that this fragment, termed SecA64, binds signal peptides with significantly higher affinity than does SecA. Moreover, the ATPase activity of SecA64 is inhibited by signal peptides to an extent that correlates with the ability of these signal peptides to inhibit either SecA translocation ATPase or in vitro protein translocation, arguing that the interaction with SecA64 is functionally significant.

Price A. Leonard A.R. Wickner W. Cell. 1997; 91: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Critical to this role is the ability of SecA to bind specifically to precursors with functional signal sequences. The structural origin of this binding is a major question, since many different sequences can act as signal sequences, but specific patterns of residues are required and define the targeting function (5Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To date, no systems have been described that enable direct characterization of SecA/signal peptide interactions without including other species that participate in the translocation reaction (membranes, SecY). Some success in dissecting the requirements for signal sequence recognition by SecA has been achieved by the use of idealized signal sequences in in vitro and in vivo protein translocation assays (6Laforet G.A. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ernst F. Hoffschulte H.K. Thome-Kromer B. Swidersky U.E. Werner P.K. Müller M. J. Biol.

Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mori H. Araki M. Chinami H. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1326: 23-36Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For example, a recent study by Miller et al. (11Miller A. Wang L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) demonstrates interaction of synthetic signal peptides with SecA in a vesicle system. Still, the complexity of these systems has made it difficult to explore the intriguing structural question of how a variety of diverse signal sequences can be specifically bound by one protein. We have been attempting to simplify the interacting species, SecA and the precursor protein, to develop a system for detailed biophysical studies. SecA is a large (901 amino acids), homodimeric, multifunctional protein with highly interdependent ligand binding activities (1Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 2Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Duong F. Eichler J. Price A. Leonard A.R. Wickner W. Cell. 1997; 91: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For example, pre-protein binding is stimulated by binding to phospholipids (12Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Moreover, binding to pre-protein and lipid stimulates the ATPase activity of SecA, yet higher activity is seen (so-called “translocation ATPase”) in the presence of SecYEG, the putative membrane translocation pore (13Cunningham K. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Several years ago, Wickner and co-workers (13Cunningham K. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) reported that signal peptides inhibit the translocation ATPase of SecA in the presence of membranes and SecY. In contrast, the recent study by Miller et al. (11Miller A. Wang L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) finds that signal peptides stimulated SecA ATPase activity in the presence of lipids. In earlier work, we observed that signal peptides inhibitin vitro protein translocation (15Chen L. Tai P.C. Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1427-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the site of inhibition in the in vitro system has not been definitively established. In these latter effects, mutant signal peptides that have low in vivo activity (monitored by the proportion of the precursor protein that attains an extracytoplasmic location and is thus cleaved by signal peptidase) are less effective in modulating ATPase or translocation activities. Clearly, it would be of great advantage to dissect the functions of SecA in order to carry out detailed studies of its interactions with ligands. Recent work from several laboratories suggests that the study of separated domains of SecA may provide an opportunity to analyze its functions in greater detail (16Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos R. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Dapic V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25000-25007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our particular interest is to elucidate the means by which SecA recognizes many different secreted proteins and to clarify how precursor binding may be regulated. In the present study, we report the isolation and characterization of SecA64, a stable proteolytic fragment of SecA lacking about one-third of the sequence from the C terminus and 10 residues from the N terminus. Our studies with SecA64 suggest that it mimics the state of SecA that recognizes and binds precursors and is then active in translocation, as described above. This fragment corresponds closely with proteolytic fragments described previously (18Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); comparable fragments have recently been expressed and characterized for some biochemical functions (16Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos R. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Dapic V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25000-25007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Like the N-terminal fragments described by these researchers, SecA64 has high ATPase activity, presumably because it lacks the proposed intramolecular regulatory region (16Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos R. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Since SecA64 has properties suggesting that it resembles the activated state of SecA critical for pre-protein delivery to the membrane, we were particularly interested in determining how signal sequence binding modulates its functions. We have used peptides corresponding to wild-type and mutant signal sequences from the Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins, LamB and OmpA, to explore signal sequence binding to SecA64. Additionally, we have compared the effects of the same signal peptides on intact SecA membrane and translocation ATPase activities as well as on in vitro protein translocation in a well defined assay system. We find that the signal peptides bind to SecA64 and inhibit its ATPase activity to an extent that parallels their ability to facilitate export in vivo. Unless specifically mentioned, standard laboratory reagents were purchased from Sigma, Fisher, or Aldrich. The source of the lipids used in the ATPase and circular dichroism (CD)1 experiments is Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Typically the lipid mixture used consisted of a 3:1 molar ratio of l-α-dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine tol-α-dioleoyl phosphatidylglycerol. SecA was purified from an overexpressingE. coli strain BL21(λDE3)pT7-SecA (20Cabelli R.J. Chen L.L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) kindly provided by J. Deisenhofer and D. Oliver. The protein was purified using a published procedure based on affinity chromatography on the resin Cibacron blue-agarose 3GA (21Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or by a second widely used protocol (22Weaver A. McDowall A.W. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 109: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Specifically, the pelleted cells were resuspended in110 volume of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF. After lysis by sonication and subsequent low speed centrifugation to remove unbroken cells and cell debris, an additional high speed centrifugation step at 300,000 × g was introduced to remove membranes. The resulting protein solution was processed as published (22Weaver A. McDowall A.W. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 109: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) except for raising the pH of all the buffer solutions to a value of 7.5 while omitting the chromatography step on MonoQ resin and applying diethylaminoethyl ion exchange chromatography as a final purification step; SecA was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.03 to 0.5m KCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF. SecA freezer stock was thawed and mixed with an equal volume of 2× digestion buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 15 mm ATP, 16 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) at 5 °C. Pre-chilled α-chymotrypsin was added to a final concentration of 0.15 mg/ml, and the sample was incubated for a time between 70 and 90 min in a 5 °C bath with mixing. When the amount of SecA64 produced had reached a maximum and most of the original SecA had been digested, the reaction was quenched by adding PMSF to 1 mm final concentration. To obtain a SecA64 sample relatively free of impurities, three chromatographic steps were used. Undigested SecA was removed from the sample by passing the reaction mixture over a Cibacron blue affinity column in the original digestion buffer. The flow-through material from the previous step was concentrated using a Centricon 30 unit and exchanged into the column equilibration buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 30 mm KCl, 300 mm guanidine (aminomethanamidine) hydrochloride, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT). Chromatography on Sephadex S200 at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.325 ml/min yielded SecA64. Pooled SecA64 fractions were concentrated in a Filtron 30 concentrator, exchanged into 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 25% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. Samples that had been purified to ∼95% purity, as assessed by densitometry of SDS gels, were used in subsequent experiments. Samples were analyzed using the Tricine-based method of Schägger and von Jagow (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10499) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, 10% acrylamide gels were used. Nondenaturing gels were prepared using the same reagents as denaturing gels but omitting SDS from all the buffers. N-terminal sequences were determined by separating proteolytic fragments using Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electroblotting to polyvinylidene fluoride (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp., Bedford MA) at 250 mA for 2.5 h in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol. Protein bands were visualized by staining for 1 min with Amido Black (0.1% in 45% methanol, 10% ethanol) and then destaining with H2O until a clear background was obtained. Protein bands selected for sequencing were cut from the membrane and sequenced using an ABI 470A automated peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). ATPase activity was estimated by either of two methods (24Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 25Norby J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 176: 4197-4203Google Scholar), which were found to give consistent results. To test the effect of lipid-binding on activity, purified protein was incubated in assay buffer at 37 °C at a concentration of 100 nm or the hydrolysis of ATP was monitored spectrophotometrically using the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled enzyme assay in the presence or absence of small unilamellar vesicles composed of a 3:1 mixture of the synthetic phospholipids l-α-dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine andl-α-dioleoyl phosphatidylglycerol at a concentration of 150 μg/ml. SecA64 ATPase activity was measured using a malachite green-ammonium molybdate colorimetric assay (24Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 400 nm SecA64 and 0.25 mm ATP (all experiments shown except that in Fig. 7 A) or 560 nm SecA64 and 5 mm ATP (Fig. 7 Aonly) in a volume of 25 μl at 37 °C. Densitometry was carried out using a Molecular Dynamics scanning laser densitometer. The density of the largest/darkest band was defined as the upper end of the density scale, and the values of the remaining bands were normalized to and expressed as a percentage of this value. CD spectra of proteins were measured in 1 mm citrate-phosphate-borate buffer, pH 7.6, at a concentration of 1.6 or 1.1 μm on an AVIV 62DS CD spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Inc., Lakewood, NJ). Secondary structure content was estimated from averaged, smoothed spectra using the method of Provencher and Glöckner (26Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar) as implemented in the computer program CONTIN. The CD spectra reported here consist of the experimental data points overlaid with the curve of calculated values as reported by CONTIN. Signal peptides were synthesized using standard solid phase methods using either Applied Biosystems 430A or Milligen 9050 automated peptide synthesizer.t-Butyloxycarbonyl- or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids were purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, Kentucky). Each crude peptide was purified using C4, C18, or phenyl reversed phase columns from Vydac (25 × 2 cm); the peptide was eluted using an H2O/CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetate in all cases. After lyophilization, the resulting peptide preparation was treated to remove of residual trifluoroacetic acid by re-lyophilization from a solution of 50 mm ammonium acetate. The composition and purity of the peptides were verified using automated sequencing on an ABI 477A sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and quantitative amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman Instrument Co.). Peptide concentrations were calculated from amino acid analysis and were estimated to be accurate to within ∼5%. To monitor interaction between a biotin-labeled signal sequence and SecA64, a gel binding assay was developed based on a reported procedure (27Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biotin label was added during synthesis using standard solid phase methods, and the labeled peptide was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using the procedures described above. Samples were prepared in 1× sample buffer (112 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 5% glycerol, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 30 min to 1 h at 4 °C to allow the system to reach equilibrium. After electrophoresis, the contents of the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose using standard electroblotting methods. The blot was probed with a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 0.1 unit/ml after the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Western blotting protocol from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The location of the bound streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate was then visualized by exposure to photographic film (HyperFilm-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was quantitated by densitometry. To standardize exposure times and facilitate comparison between samples, nitrocellulose strips containing known amounts of the labeled peptides were prepared from a stock labeled peptide solution of known concentration using a Schleicher and Schuell Minifold II slot-blotting device. SecA-depleted membrane vesicles were prepared from CK1801.4 cells as previously described (28Chen X. Xu H. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29698-29706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Translocation ATPase reactions were carried out in 50-μl volumes, with 5-μg membranes, 0.2 μg of SecA, 0.2 μg of proOmpA, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 1× buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm KCl). The proOmpA used for this assay was purified according to published procedures (13Cunningham K. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We found that 100 μg/ml CK1801.4 membranes support a linear translocation ATPase activity at 40 °C up to 10 min. In vitro protein synthesis of proOmpA was carried out at 40 °C for 15 min using mRNA enriched for OmpA (prepared from strain HJM114 containing plasmids pOmpA and pC1857 upon induction of theompA gene) (29Geller B.L. Movva N.R. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4219-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the precursors were purified by an immuno-affinity column as described (30Chen L. Tai P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Chen L. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 389-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proOmpA molecules labeled with [35S]methionine were eluted from the OmpA IgG-agarose column with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, 1 mm DTT. The eluants were neutralized with Tris base to pH 7.6 and used immediately for translocation. The translocation mixture (0.1 ml) contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm spermidine HCl, 8 mmputrescine HCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 60 μl of immuno-purified proOmpA (final concentration of 120 mm glycine), 0.05 A 280 units of membrane vesicles, 2 μg of purified SecA unless otherwise indicated, and an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP-Tris, 0.02 mm GTP-Tris, 5 mm phosphoenol pyruvate-Tris, 3 μg of pyruvate kinase). Synthetic signal peptides were added at the start of the translocation assay. After translocation had proceeded for 15 min at 40 °C, samples were chilled and exposed to proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 15 min at 0 °C. Membrane vesicles were isolated, and the translocated products were analyzed in SDS-gel electrophoresis as described (30Chen L. Tai P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Chen L. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 389-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize the radioactive polypeptides, gels were treated with Autofluor (National Diagnostic), dried, and exposed to Kodak XR-5 film at −76 °C. For quantitation, fluorograms were scanned by densitometry as described (31Chen L. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 389-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To calculate the efficiency of translocation, the amount of translocated OmpA (resistant to proteinase K treatment and recovered with the membrane vesicles) was compared with the total input of purified proOmpA (corrected for difference in methionine content) present in translocation assays. Limited proteolysis of SecA with α-chymotrypsin in the presence of ATP gives rise to a 64-kDa polypeptide that is remarkably stable (Fig. 1 A). During the course of chymotryptic digestion, the ATPase activity of SecA and its proteolytic fragments increases severalfold, whereas lipid stimulation of the ATPase activity decreased during the same time period (Fig.1 B). We have isolated and purified the 64-kDa fragment, which we term SecA64, and found that the elevated ATPase activity co-purifies with it (Fig. 1 C). The specific activity of purified SecA64, 2850 ± 236 pmol ATP min−1 μg of protein−1, is in the same range as reported for SecA translocation ATPase activity (11Miller A. Wang L. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 13Cunningham K. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of SecA64 showed that it is derived from the N-terminal portion of SecA through the loss of the C-terminal one-third of the protein and the loss of the first 10 amino acids from the N terminus. Examination of the sequence leads to the conclusion that SecA64 most likely spans a region from amino acids 11 to 586. As shown in Fig. 2, the CD spectrum of SecA64 is consistent with a stably folded domain or combination of domains. Curve-fitting analysis of the SecA64 CD spectrum leads to an estimate of ∼49% helix, 26% sheet, and 24% other, which compares quite closely with the fit for the SecA CD, 66% helix, 18% sheet, and 16% remainder. To explore the interaction of SecA64 with signal sequences, we utilized a series of synthetic signal peptides (Fig.3) based on signal sequence mutations in LamB, the λ phage receptor of E. coli (32Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4599-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17293-17297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a second series from the signal sequence of the outer membrane protein OmpA (36Lehnhardt S. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1716-1719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Goldstein J. Lehnhardt S. Inouye M. J. Biol.

Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10155-10163Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The interaction between protein and signal sequence was probed using a gel binding assay in which complex formation was detected by co-migration of a biotin-labeled signal peptide with SecA in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (27Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its net positive charge, the free biotinylated peptide did not enter the gel to any appreciable extent, whereas SecA, a predominantly negative protein, migrated into the gel, carrying bound peptide with it. Binding of the signal peptide to SecA is relatively weak (Fig.4), as expected from the low affinity interaction of SecA with pre-proteins in solution (12Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SecA64 sample showed a clearly visible signal (Fig. 4), indicating that the peptide bound substantially more strongly to this fragment of SecA. Functional, unlabeled signal sequences competed effectively for the binding of the biotin-labeled peptide to SecA64, whereas non-functional signal peptides did not (Fig. 5). A peptide corresponding to the wild-type LamB signal sequence effectively competed with the biotin-labeled peptide for binding, but the peptide containing the four-residue deletion in the hydrophobic core, LamBΔ78, competed poorly. A peptide that harbors a single proline to leucine change, which restores function to the deletion mutant in vivo, LamBΔ78r2 (32Emr S.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4599-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), competed for binding at near wild-type levels, indicating that effective competition requires a functional signal sequence. The addition of LamBWT signal peptide inhibits the ATPase activity of SecA64 (Fig. 6). Under the same conditions, the ATPase activity of native SecA was affected only slightly by the signal peptide. For the family of LamB signal peptides, the capacity to inhibit SecA64 ATPase paralleled binding affinity as monitored by competition (Fig.7 A). At concentrations where the wild-type peptide clearly inhibits activity, the signal peptide corresponding to the nonfunctional deletion mutant, LamBΔ78, had no observable effect on the activity of SecA64. The signal peptide from the functional revertant strain, LamBΔ78r2, was able to inhibit activity. These results argue that ATPase inhibition arises from functionally relevant interactions of signal peptides with SecA64. To test the generality of the above observations, we examined the ability of a set of OmpA signal peptides (Fig. 3) (36Lehnhardt S. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. J. Biol.

The wild-type enzyme is only able to efficiently utilize 2-oxoglutarate and 2-oxoadipate as a 2-oxoacid co-substrate. Mutation of arginine 258, the side chain of which forms an electrostatic interaction with the 5-carboxylate of the 2-oxoglutarate co-substrate, to a glutamine residue reduced activity to about 5% of the wild-type enzyme with 2-oxoglutarate. However, other aliphatic 2-oxoacids, which were not co-substrates for the wild-type enzyme, were utilized by the R258Q mutant. These 2-oxoacids “rescued” catalytic activity to the level observed for the wild-type enzyme as judged by penicillin N and G conversion. These co-substrates underwent oxidative decarboxylation as observed for 2-oxoglutarate in the normal reaction with the wild-type enzyme. Crystal structures of the iron(II)- 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate (1.5 Å), and iron(II)-2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate (1.6 Å) enzyme complexes were obtained, which reveal the molecular basis for this “chemical co-substrate rescue” and help to rationalize the co-substrate selectivity of 2-oxoglutaratedependent oxygenases.1hjg1hjf Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase is an iron(II) 2-oxoglutaratedependent oxygenase that catalyzes the oxidative ring-expansion of penicillin N to deacetoxycephalosporin C.

The subsequent hydroxylation of DAOC to deacetylcephalosporin C (DAC) is catalyzed by a closely related enzyme, deacetylcephalosporin C synthase (DACS). In Cephalosporium acremonium a single, bifunctional protein, deacetoxy/deacetylcephalosporin C synthase (DAOC/DAC synthase), performs both reactions (2Baldwin J.E. Abraham E. Nat. Prod.

Wolfe S. Demain A.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DAOCS is a member of the iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase family, which catalyze a wide variety of oxidative reactions (6Prescott A.G. J. Exp. Bot. 1993; 44: 849-861Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). DAOCS, DACS, and DAOC/DAC synthase belong to a subgroup of more closely related enzymes, which have significant primary sequence homology to one another (6Prescott A.G. J. Exp. Bot. 1993; 44: 849-861Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Also included in this group are two enzymes which do not use 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate, isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS), the iron-dependent oxidase responsible for formation of the penicillin nucleus, and 1-amino-1-carboxycyclopropane oxidase (ACCO) which catalyzes the last step during ethylene biosynthesis in plants. Mechanistic understanding of iron(II), 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases have been significantly advanced by the recently determined crystal structures of DAOCS (1Lloyd M.D. Lee H.-J. Harlos K.

Biol. 2000; 7: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The DAOCS crystal structures revealed the presence of a number of arginine residues within the active site, with arginine 258 (part of a conserved RXS motif) being involved in co-substrate binding (1Lloyd M.D. Lee H.-J. Harlos K. Zhang Z.H. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Charnock J.M. Garner C.D. Hara T. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Valegård K. Viklund J.A.C. Hajdu J. Andersson I. Danielsson Å. Bhikhabhai R. J. Mol.

The equivalent RXS motif residues in Aspergillus nidulans IPNS, arginine 281, and serine 283, bind the α-carboxylate group of theL-δ-(α-aminoadipoyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine substrate (11Roach P.L.

Both of these residues have been shown to be important for substrate binding in the C. acremonium isoenzyme by site-directed mutagenesis (12Loke P. Sim T.-S. FEMS Microbiol.

Here we report studies on the 2-oxoglutarate co-substrate-binding function of arginine 258 in DAOCS by site-directed mutagenesis. Activity of the R258Q mutant was reduced in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate, but could be fully restored using aliphatic 2-oxoacids as alternative co-substrates. The process is called “chemical co-substrate rescue.” The molecular basis for this phenomenon has been investigated by crystallographic analyses of the R258Q mutant complexed with iron(II) and alternative 2-oxoacids. The results have implications for clinically observed mutations to phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase that result in Refsum's disease. 2M. Mukherji, N. J. Kershaw, C. H. MacKinnon, I. J. Clifton, C. J.

Analyses by ESI MS (observed 34,532 ± 6 Da; calculated 34,525 Da) and DNA sequencing indicated that no undesired mutations were present, while CD analyses suggested there were no gross changes to the secondary structure of the enzyme. Both the wild-type enzyme and the R258Q mutant were analyzed for their ability to catalyze the conversion of penicillin N and penicillin G to their respective products using discontinuous HPLC assays for cephem production (Table I). The results demonstrated that wild-type DAOCS has, at most, only traces of activity with all 2-oxoacids tested other than 2-oxoglutarate and 2-oxoadipate.Table IRelative penicillin N and penicillin G conversions (% of wild-type) by the R258Q mutant (17 μg/assay) in the presence of alternative 2-oxoacidsa Activities measured with HPLC assay.

Standard deviations for these data are estimated to be 10–15% with both assays.

The R258Q DAOCS mutant was able to convert 2-oxoglutarate to succinate and carbon dioxide in the presence of either penicillin N and penicillin G. Two experiments were carried out (in duplicate) to investigate the coupling of penicillin and 2-oxoglutarate conversion by the R258Q mutant. The level of conversion of penicillin N (28%) and penicillin G (≪ 5%) (relative to wild-type enzyme) was much lower than the levels of 2-oxoglutarate conversion (67 and 29%, respectively), suggesting this mutation causes significant uncoupling of 2-oxoglutarate and penicillin oxidation. This contrasts with the wild-type enzyme in which penicillin oxidation is tightly coupled (with a ratio of 1.06:1 for the native enzyme using 2-oxoglutarate and penicillin N (23Baldwin J.E. Crabbe M.J.C. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and 1.07:1 for the recombinant enzyme using 2-oxoglutarate and penicillin G (9Lee H.-J. Lloyd M.D. Harlos K. Clifton I.J. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). This probably accounts (at least in part) for the poor efficiency of penicillin oxidation by the R258Q mutant. The possibility of penicillin oxidation being uncoupled from 2-oxoglutarate oxidation should be taken into consideration when comparing the apparent kinetic parameters in Tables I,II, and TableIII.Table IIIKinetic parameters for R258Q DAOCS with various 2-oxoacid co-substrates with penicillin N or penicillin GFixed substrateVariable substrateKm(2-oxoacid)kcatkcat/Kmmms−1m−1s−1HPLC assay (1)Penicillin N (100 μm)2-Oxo-3-methylbutanoate0.18 ± 0.010.014 ± 0.00377.7Penicillin N (100 μm)2-Oxo-4-methylpentanoate0.08 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.001625Penicillin N (100 μm)2-Oxo-5-thiahexanoate0.36 ± 0.10.025 ± 0.00569.4Penicillin G (10,000 μm)2-Oxo-3-methylbutanoate0.18 ± 0.010.005 ± 0.000327.7Penicillin G (10,000 μm)2-Oxo-4-methylpentanoate0.38 ± 0.080.013 ± 0.00234.2Spectrophotometric assay (fn. 3)2-OxobutanoatePenicillin G2.54 ± 0.250.036 ± 0.00114.12-Oxo-3-methylbutanoate (1,000 μm)Penicillin G3.00 ± 0.150.082 ± 0.00327.32-Oxopentanoate (500 μm)Penicillin G1.73 ± 0.290.032 ± 0.00218.52-Oxo-4-methylpentanoate (1,000 μm)Penicillin G3.82 ± 0.410.046 ± 0.00212.0 Open table in a new tab The R258Q mutant was able to utilize several other 2-oxoacids as co-substrates when penicillin N was a substrate, most notably 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate, 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate, and 2-oxo-5-thiahexanoic acid. The alternative 2-oxoacids were also utilized when penicillin G was the prime substrate although the activity was somewhat lower. As with the reaction with penicillin N, the two best co-substrates were 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate and 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate. The lower activity for penicillin G compared with penicillin N is probably due to poorer coupling of penicillin oxidation to co-substrate conversion for the former. The increased tolerance for alternative co-substrates by the single R258Q mutation to the wild-type enzyme is noteworthy. 1H NMR and ESI MS analyses were used to characterize products of the incubation of 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate and 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate with the R258Q mutant in the presence and absence of penicillin G. No evidence for their modification, other than oxidative decarboxylation to give 3-methylbutanoate and 2-methylpropanoate, respectively, was obtained. This implies that 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate and 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate fulfill the same role as 2-oxoglutarate in the wild-type enzyme. Apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for the R258Q mutant with the “unnatural” 2-oxoacids were determined at a single concentration of the second substrate. Analysis of the R258Q mutant showed that 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate and 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate are utilized with a efficiency similar (as judged byKcat/Km) to that of 2-oxoglutarate with the wild-type enzyme (Tables II and III). Detailed kinetic analyses have revealed that substrate inhibition of the wild-type enzyme occurred at high concentrations of 2-oxoglutarate.3 A similar although less pronounced phenomenon was observed for the R258Q mutant with 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate and 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate as co-substrates with penicillin G as substrate. Due to the low levels of activity of the R258Q mutant with 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of penicillin G it was not possible to obtain accurate values for the kinetic parameters, but the apparent Km for 2-oxoglutarate was increased by >1000-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme.3 Crystal structures of the R258Q mutant complexes with iron(II) and 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate and iron(II) and 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate were determined to high resolution (1.5 and 1.6 Å, respectively) (TableIV). The structures had similar overall structures to the iron(II)-2-oxoglutarate complex of the wild-type enzyme (root mean squared deviation Cα differences = 0.267 and 0.282 Å, respectively) (8Valegård K. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lloyd M.D. Hara T. Ramaswamy S. Perrakis A. Thompson A. Lee H.-J. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Andersson I. Nature. 1998; 394: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Both structures show that the 2-oxoacid moiety is ligated to the iron in the active site in a bidentate manner similar to that observed for 2-oxoglutarate in the wild-type enzyme (1Lloyd M.D. Lee H.-J. Harlos K. Zhang Z.H. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Charnock J.M. Garner C.D. Hara T. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Valegård K. Viklund J.A.C. Hajdu J. Andersson I. Danielsson Å. Bhikhabhai R. J. Mol.

The protein ligands are provided with the side chains of His-183, Asp-185 and His-243, and, as before, the sixth ligand to the iron is water. This water is proposed to be displaced by binding of the “prime” substrate, allowing oxygen binding and initiation of the catalytic cycle (1Lloyd M.D. Lee H.-J. Harlos K. Zhang Z.H. Baldwin J.E.

However, the side chain of glutamine 258 is now disordered. Binding of the side chains of 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate and 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate is apparently via hydrophobic interactions involving those residues which normally “bind” to the C-3 and C-4 methylene groups of 2-oxoglutarate (i.e. Met-180, Ile-192, Leu-204, Phe-225, Val-245, and Val-262) (Fig.1). The result of this interaction is that the co-substrate side chains are slightly displaced from the positions occupied by the methylene groups of 2-oxoglutarate.Table IVCrystallographic parameters for the structures of the R258Q mutant complexed with iron(II) and either 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate or 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoateIron2-Oxo-3-methylbutanoate2-Oxo-4-methylpentanoateTotal observations175,826122,299Unique observations38,28332,966Redundancy2.93.3% Completeness88.895.7(outer shell)(90.9)(97.5)Rmerge5.77.0(outer shell)(54.2)(72.8)I/SigI6.867.5(outer shell)(1.4)(1.0)cell dimensions (Å)107.10, 107.10, 70.86106.93, 106.93, 70.82Unit cell angles (°)90, 90, 12090, 90, 120Space groupR3 (146)R3 (146)Resolution range (Å)20–1.5020–1.60(outer shell)(1.51–1.50)(1.62–1.60)Rfree4-aRfree andRcryst as defined by CNS (20).0.2420.269Rcryst4-aRfree andRcryst as defined by CNS (20).0.2250.241Twin fraction0.1660.335Residues modelled1–80, 98–165, 178–195, 201–247, 257–3071–81, 91–164, 178–195, 201–247, 257–309Disordered residues81–97, 166–177, 196–201, 248–256, 308–31182–90, 165–177, 196–200, 248–256, 310–311Number of waters19398Root mean square bond lengths 4-bRoot mean squared deviation from ideal values.0.0230.013Root mean square bond angles4-bRoot mean squared deviation from ideal values.1.21.24-a Rfree andRcryst as defined by CNS (20Brünger A.T.

Open table in a new tab The R258Q mutant was chosen for analysis as it was hoped that the glutamine side chain would allow for an active site with an intact conformation, while allowing other 2-oxoacids with hydrophobic side chains to bind. The utilization of alternative co-substrates has been previously investigated for several oxygenases related to DAOCS. 2-Oxoadipate, which possesses an additional methylene group compared with 2-oxoglutarate, has been shown to be a co-substrate for clavaminic acid synthase (25Elson S.W.

Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3165-3174PubMed Google Scholar). γ-Butyrobetaine hydroxylase is also able to utilize both 2-oxoadipate and oxaloacetate, the latter of which is one methylene group shorter than 2-oxoglutarate, albeit with greatly increased Km values (29Ng S.F. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Englard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1526-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate dioxygenase is reported to be able to utilize a number of alternative 2-oxoacids, albeit relatively inefficiently (30Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24311-24317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other than IPNS and ACCO, the only known non-heme-dependent oxygenase that does not utilize 2-oxoglutarate as its preferred “co-substrate” is 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. However, the structure of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase places it in the family of catechol dioxygenases, (31Serre L. Sailland A. Sy D. Boudec P. Rolland A. Pebay-Peyroula E. Cohen-Addad C. Structure. 1999; 7: 977-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and it carries out a four-electron oxidation and decarboxylation of the same 2-oxoacid, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. It is related to the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases by mechanism and can utilize 3-thienylpyruvate (32Crouch N.P. Adlington R.M. Baldwin J.E. Lee M.-H. MacKinnon C.H. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 6993-7010Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), α-ketoisocaproate (2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate) (33Crouch N.P. Baldwin J.E. Lee M.H. MacKinnon C.H. Zhang Z.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Lett. 1996; 16: 2003-2006Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as (co)substrates. In contrast, α-ketoisovalerate (2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate) and α-keto-β-methyl-n-valerate (2-oxo-3-methylpentanoate), derived from valine and isoleucine, respectively, were not converted to their corresponding products (32Crouch N.P. Adlington R.M. Baldwin J.E. Lee M.-H. MacKinnon C.H. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 6993-7010Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results show that the side chain of arginine 258 is a major determinant of the 2-oxoacid co-substrate selectivity of DAOCS and, by implication, related oxygenases. The decrease in activity of the R258Q DAOCS mutant observed with 2-oxoglutarate is probably due to the loss of a favorable ionic interaction between the 5-carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate and the guanidino group of arginine 258. Thus, it appears that 2-oxo-4-methylpentanoate and 2-oxo-3-methylbutanoate are utilized as efficient co-substrates by the R258Q mutant because they possesses hydrophobic side chains similar to that of 2-oxoglutarate but do not have the unfavorable polar interactions. As proposed for prolyl hydroxylase (35Majamaa K. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the structural and biochemical results imply that DAOCS has three key subsites for 2-oxoglutarate binding,viz. the iron-ligation site, the RXS motif (Arg-258 and Ser-260) binding to the 5-carboxylate, and a hydrophobic region binding to the C3- and C4-methylene groups of 2-oxoglutarate. These results also demonstrate that the catalytic effectiveness of the 2-oxoacid co-substrate is dependent on which prime substrate is utilized (i.e. penicillin N versus penicillin G). A factor in determining catalytic efficiency is the level of coupling of 2-oxoacid oxidation to penicillin oxidation. Several recent studies on related enzymes have suggested that dioxygen binding to the iron-2-oxoglutarate enzyme complex is promoted by the presence of the prime substrate in the active site (10Zhang Z.-H. Ren J. Stammers J.K. Baldwin J.E. Harlos K. Schofield C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 24Zhou J. Gunsior M. Bachmann B. Townsend C.A. Soloman E.I.

Oxidative decarboxylation of the 2-oxoacid co-substrate is thought to generate a reactive ferryl species, which is responsible for oxidation of the prime substrate (37Hanauske-Abel H.M. Günzler V. J. Theor. Biol. 1982; 94: 421-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Crystallographic evidence for the presence of this intermediate in the reaction of the iron(II)-dependent oxygenase, isopenicillin N synthase has been recently obtained (38Burzlaff N.I. Rutledge P.J. Clifton I.J. Hensgens C.M. Pickford M. Adlington R.M. Roach P.L. Baldwin J.E. Nature. 1999; 401: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The kinetic results further support the idea that cooperative binding of the 2-oxoacid and penicillin sites is required for efficient catalysis. The relatively large amount of uncoupled conversion of 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of penicillin G for the R258Q DAOCS mutant may be a reflection of an “editing” mechanism used by the enzyme to select for the correct or “correctly bound” prime substrate (1Lloyd M.D. Lee H.-J. Harlos K. Zhang Z.H. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Charnock J.M. Garner C.D. Hara T. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Valegård K. Viklund J.A.C. Hajdu J. Andersson I. Danielsson Å. Bhikhabhai R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 943-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Studies on human prolyl-4-hydroxylase (39Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) have shown that mutation of His-501 lead to increases in the level of uncoupled conversion of 2-oxoglutarate by about 12-fold. This appears to be due to a relative reduction in the rate of prolyl-residue hydroxylation compared with that of 2-oxoglutarate conversion. The authors proposed that His-501 directed binding of the 2-oxoacid moiety of 2-oxoglutarate and accelerated the breakdown of the ferryl intermediate. In the light of the results presented in this paper it may be that His-501 is ligating to the 5-carboxylate of the 2-oxoglutarate co-substrate in addition to ligation by Lys-493, and that mutation led to a decrease in coupling of 2-oxoglutarate and prime substrate oxidation. The metal-binding sites of non-heme oxygenases containing iron are closely related to those of hydrolytic enzymes containing either zinc or iron (40Schofield C.J. Zhang Z.-H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Before the concentration of dioxygen reached present day levels it is possible that iron-dependent enzymes were involved in many non-redox reactions, e.g. hydrolytic reactions, reflecting the bioavailability of this metal (41Williams R.J.P. Frausto de Silva J.J.R. The Natural Selection of the Chemical Elements. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996Google Scholar). Upon increases in dioxygen levels it is possible that some of these enzymes evolved to use zinc, thereby avoiding deleterious oxidative damage, while others evolved into oxygenases/oxidases. The increases in dioxygen levels probably also caused proliferation of the Kreb's cycle of which 2-oxoglutarate is an intermediate. The parallel increases in dioxygen and 2-oxoglutarate concentrations may have also influenced the evolution of selectivity for 2-oxoglutarate over other less abundant or ubiquitous 2-oxoacids such as 2-oxoadipate. 2-Oxoacids are common metabolites and readily form bidentate ligands with iron. The question therefore arises how and why the non-heme iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases appear to have evolved a (relatively strict) selectivity for 2-oxoglutarate. One reason may be that 2-oxoglutarate is a common primary metabolite, but other 2-oxoacids, e.g. pyruvate, are also ubiquitous. The proposed binding mode of 2-oxoglutarate at the active site of DAOCS rationalizes the utilization of 2-oxoglutarate and its close analogue 2-oxoadipate, and the deselection of 2-oxoacids with hydrophobic side chains. The results presented here and elsewhere (39Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) also demonstrate that incorrect binding of 2-oxoacids can increase the extent of prime substrate uncoupled oxidation. Furthermore, it seems that cooperativity between the 2-oxoacid and the prime substrate-binding sites is required for efficient catalysis. The exact mechanism for this cooperativity in the catalytic process during and subsequent to dioxygen binding requires further investigation. The evolution of the use of 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate may reflect a need for precision (including ordered binding/release) during part of the catalytic process. This may be best achieved using a relatively rigid electrostatic interaction such as that formed between Arg-258 and the 5-carboxylate rather than a hydrophobic interaction or other electrostatic/hydrogen bonding interactions. Thus, the selection of 2-oxoglutarate over pyruvate may also reflect mechanistic considerations. We have termed the restoration of activity by the use of a modified 2-oxoacid “chemical co-substrate rescue.” The chemical rescue of mutant enzymes has been extensively investigated, although studies have focused on restoring the role of a mutated amino acid residue,e.g. by using organic amines (42Rynkiewicz M.J. Seaton B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16174-16179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43Huang S. Tu S.-C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6214-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The rescue of activity using modified (co)-substrates has been relatively underexplored, although ATP derivatives have been elegantly used to investigate the function of kinases (47Liu Y. Shah K. Yang F. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 91-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated chemical co-substrate rescue of several clinically observed mutants of phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase using alternative 2-oxoacids.2The results in this paper give the first indications of the molecular and structural basis for this process, and suggest that many non-heme-dependent oxygenases control 2-oxoacid co-substrate selectivity in a similar manner.

https://openalex.org/W1999218202,"Abstract The human U6 small nuclear (sn) RNA core promoter consists of a proximal sequence element, which recruits the multisubunit factor SNAPc, and a TATA box, which recruits the TATA box-binding protein, TBP. In addition to SNAPc and TBP, transcription from the human U6 promoter requires two well defined factors. The first is hB, a human homologue of the B subunit of yeast TFIIIB generally required for transcription of RNA polymerase III genes, and the second is hBRFU, one of two human homologues of the yeast TFIIIB subunit BRF specifically required for transcription of U6-type RNA polymerase III promoters. Here, we have partially purified and characterized a RNA polymerase III complex that can direct transcription from the human U6 promoter when combined with recombinant SNAPc, recombinant TBP, recombinant hB, and recombinant hBRFU. These results open the way to reconstitution of U6 transcription from entirely defined components."

Disruption of mouse Ror2 leads to profound skeletal abnormalities, with essentially all endochondrally derived bones foreshortened. The important role of Ror2 in skeletal patterning is also supported by the results of Oldridge et al. (17Oldridge M. Fortuna A.-M. Maringa M. Propping P. Mansour S. Pollitt C. DeChiara T.M.

These authors have demonstrated that brachydactyly type B in humans is caused by dominant mutations in the Ror2 gene. Recessive mutations of the gene encoding the human ROR2 tyrosine kinase were found to cause Robinow syndrome, a short-limbed dwarfism with cardiac malformations (18Afzal A.R. Rajab A. Fenske C.D.

The extracellular domains of the different members of the Ror family of receptor tyrosine kinases have quite different domain organizations. The extracellular regions of Ror1 and Ror2 receptor tyrosine kinases of vertebrates (20Masiakowski P. Carroll R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26181-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the C. elegans homologue, cam-1 (13Forrester W.C. Deil M. Perens E. Garriga G. Nature. 1999; 400: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), consist of an immunoglobulin-like domain at the amino terminus and a FRZ domain and kringle domain just amino-terminal to the transmembrane segment (Fig. 1). In the case of two Drosophila homologues, Dror and Dnrk, both the FRZ and kringle domains are present, but they are devoid of immunoglobulin-like domains (11Wilson C. Goberdhan D.C. Steller H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7109-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Oishi I. Sugiyama S. Liu Z.J. Yamamura H. Nishida Y. Minami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11916-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the case of MuSK, the receptor tyrosine kinase involved in neuromuscular junction formation (21Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Thomas S. Le Beau M.M. Fernald A.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Burden S.J. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1995; 1995: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (358) Google Scholar), the extracellular region contains three immunoglobulin-like domains and a FRZ domain, but no kringle domain (Fig. 1). It is thus noteworthy that the only domain type common to all members of the Ror family of receptor tyrosine kinases is the FRZ module, suggesting a critical functional role for this domain type. There is experimental evidence consistent with the importance of the FRZ modules of various Ror-type receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently Zhou et al. (22Zhou H. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have carried out a systematic analysis of the contribution of distinct domains of MuSK to its ability to induce and associate with postsynaptic specializations. Their results indicate that deletion of the FRZ domain (consisting of a C6 box plus the Ig-IV region in the authors' terminology) specifically eliminates MusK/Rapsyn co-clustering. The functional importance of the FRZ module may also explain the results of Forrester et al. (13Forrester W.C. Deil M. Perens E. Garriga G. Nature. 1999; 400: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These authors have shown that the C. elegans Ror receptor tyrosine kinase cam-1 regulates cell motility and asymmetric cell division in the nematode; nonsense mutations lying within the FRZ domain of this receptor tyrosine kinase eliminate cam-1 function. The mutant phenotype is not due to loss of the activity of the downstream tyrosine kinase domain because mutations that lead only to loss of tyrosine kinase activity have only subtle effects on cell migrations (13Forrester W.C. Deil M. Perens E. Garriga G. Nature. 1999; 400: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The observation of Afzal et al. (18Afzal A.R. Rajab A. Fenske C.D. Oldridge M. Elanko N. Ternes-Pereira E. Tuysuz B. Murday V.A. Patton M.A. Wilkie A.O. Jeffery S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) that missense mutations in the frizzled domain of Ror2 receptor tyrosine kinase can lead to Robinow syndrome indicates that this domain is essential for Ror2 function. No ligands have been identified thus far for the Ror1 and Ror2 receptor tyrosine kinases. However, based on the presence of a FRZ module in the putative ligand-binding region, it has been suggested that WNT proteins might act as ligands for the FRZ modules of Rors (5Xu Y.K. Nusse R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R405-R406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. Hoffmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 415-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious biological importance of the FRZ module, nothing is known about its three-dimensional structure. In fact, there is still some controversy over whether the FRZ module corresponds to a single domain or is composed of two domains (5Xu Y.K. Nusse R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R405-R406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This controversy stems primarily from the fact that in the middle of the FRZ module of Dror, there is a 55-amino acid insert between the fifth and sixth cysteines, separating the 10 conserved cysteines into two groups. Accordingly, the FRZ domain is sometimes subdivided into two regions, for example, the C6 box and the Ig-IV region in the case of MuSK (22Zhou H. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To define the structure and function of this important module type, in the present work we have expressed the FRZ module of rat Ror1 inPichia pastoris. Our structural studies on the recombinant protein indicate that the FRZ module corresponds to a single, compact, disulfide-bonded structural domain. The DNA segment coding for the frizzled domain of rat ROR1 receptor tyrosine kinase (residues Gly168-Ala304) was amplified with the 5′-CTGCCCGGGGCATATGGGNTTYTGYCARCCNTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTTANGCCATNGGHATNCCAA-3′ (antisense) primers from a rat fetal brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). The amplified DNA was digested with SmaI and HindIII restriction endonucleases and ligated into M13mp19 Rf digested with the same enzymes. The sequence of the cloned DNA was determined by dideoxy sequencing on both strands. The FRZ domain of rat ROR1 receptor tyrosine kinase was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris by utilizing the Easy Select P. pastoris expression kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA fragment encoding the FRZ domain was excised from M13mp19/CR16 with SmaI-NcoI digestion and blunt-end-ligated into pPICZαA cut withEcoRI-XbaI. The sticky ends of the digested DNA fragment and the vector were filled with Klenow polymerase. The pPICZαA expression plasmid contains the zeocin resistance gene for easy selection of positive transformants, the inducible PAOX1 promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene of P. pastoris, and the yeast α-mating factor secretion signal sequence. At the 3′ end, the inserted DNA fragment was in-frame-ligated to the sequence encoding the c-myc epitope and a hexahistidine His tag. The plasmid contains the 3′ termination signal of the AOX1 gene. Escherichia coli JM 109 cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and plated on low salt LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing 25 μg/ml zeocin. Zeocin-resistant colonies were screened for the presence of DNA encoding the FRZ domain by polymerase chain reaction using AOX1- and FRZ-specific primers and by restriction analysis. The plasmid pPICZαA/CR was linearized by BstXI digestion to promote the homologous recombination at the AOX1 locus of the yeast genome. TheP. pastoris KM71 (HIS4−, AOX1−) strain was transformed by electroporation, and positive transformants were selected on zeocin-containing YPDS (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 1 m sorbitol, 100 μg/ml zeocin) plates as described in the Pichia Expression System users manual (Invitrogen). Zeocin-resistant colonies were screened for protein expression in small volume cultures according to a procedure described previously (23Steinlein L.M. Ligman C.M. Kessler S. Ikeda R.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13696-13703Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thirty-two recombinant clones of P. pastoris were grown in 2-ml aliquots of BMGY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 0.4 μg/ml biotin, and 1% glycerol) at 30 °C to anA600 = 15–20. Cell were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1-ml aliquots of BMMY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 0.4 μg/ml biotin, and 1% methanol). The different recombinant clones were grown for 96 h at 30 °C with the addition of 1% methanol (final concentration) at 24-h intervals. Expression of recombinant protein was monitored by analyzing the culture fluids with SDS-PAGE. The clone secreting the highest amount of recombinant protein was chosen for large scale protein expression. 400 ml of BMGY medium was inoculated with one colony of the appropriate yeast clone and grown at 30 °C to an A600 = 20–25. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 200 ml of BMMY. The induction was continued for 168 h, and methanol addition was repeated at every 24 h. The culture was centrifuged at 3,000 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed against a 10-fold volume of distilled water. The pH of the dialysate was adjusted to 7.9, and then a 0.1 volume of 10× binding buffer (200 mm Tris and 50 mmimidazole, pH 7.9) was added. The solution was loaded on a 10-ml nickel-chelate column (Invitrogen), and then the column was washed with 10 volumes of washing buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.9), and the bound protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris and 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.9. The fractions containing recombinant FRZ module were pooled, lyophilized, desalted by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and lyophilized. The FRZ module was further purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column, equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, and lyophilized. The recombinant protein was deglycosylated by digestion with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The recombinant protein (1 mg/ml) was dissolved in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, and incubated with 500 New England Biolabs units of endoglycosidase H for 16 h at 37 °C. The digested protein was isolated by nickel-chelate column chromatography. CD spectra were measured over the range of 190–250 nm by using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter thermostated with a Neslab RT-100 water bath. The measurements were carried out in 1-mm pathlength cells and protein solutions of ∼0.1–0.3 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. All spectra were measured at 25 °C with a 16 s time constant and a scan rate of 10 nm/min. The spectral slit width was 1.0 nm. All measurements represent the computer average of three scans. Secondary structure of recombinant proteins was estimated from their CD spectra with the J-720 program for Windows Secondary Structure Estimation Ver.1.10.00, JASCO.3. Calorimetric measurements were carried out on a VP-DSC MicroCalorimeter at a heating rate of 1 °C/min and a solution concentration of 0.2–0.5 mg/ml. Experiments were conducted at pH 8.0 in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer. Buffer base lines were obtained under the same conditions and subtracted from sample tracings. The VP-DSC MicroCalorimeter was calibrated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Differential scanning calorimetry data analysis was performed with the Microcal Origin Version 5.0 program. Secondary structure prediction of the FRZ module of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase, based on multiple alignments of FRZ modules, was carried out with previously described procedures (24Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar, 25Rost B. Rawlings C. Clark D. Altman R. Hunter L. Lengauer T. Wodak S.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Profile Network Prediction Heidelberg (PHD) mail server. The PHD server predicts secondary structural elements by evaluating the relative probabilities that a given segment can be assigned to helix, strand, or loop. The estimated accuracy of this multiple alignment-based method for the correct prediction of secondary elements is about 72%. The composition of protein samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 11–22% linear polyacrylamide gradient slab gels under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The concentration of the recombinant FRZ module of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase was determined using the extinction coefficient 6700m−1 cm−1. The extinction coefficients were determined according to a method described previously (28Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). 170-μg samples of recombinant FRZ domain (in 70 μl of 1 mm HCl, pH 3) were digested with 1 μg of pepsin (Sigma) at room temperature for 2 h. 100 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, was added to the reaction mixture and digested with 8.5 μg of trypsin (Sigma) and 8.5 μg of chymotrypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 16 h. Samples were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on an Aquapore OD 300 (220 × 2.1-mm) C18 column (PE Applied Biosystems Ltd.) in 0.1% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid with a linear gradient of acetonitrile. N-terminal sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 471A protein sequencer with an on-line ABI 120A phenyltiohydantoin analyzer. On the basis of the known sequences of human and mouse Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinases (GenBankTM accession numbers M97675 and AB010383), we have designed polymerase chain reaction primers for the amplification of the cDNA segment encoding the FRZ domain of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into M13 sequencing vector, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the FRZ module of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase with those of the human and mouse orthologues has revealed extensive sequence similarity (Fig. 2). The rat cDNA differs in 42 nucleotide positions from the human sequence and in 18 positions from the mouse sequence. The differences of nucleotide sequences are mainly in silent positions, resulting in only two and one amino acid substitutions relative to the human and mouse sequences, respectively (Fig. 2). The cDNA encoding the FRZ domain of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase was subcloned into the pPICZαA P. pastorisexpression vector. The cDNA was in-frame-ligated to theSaccharomyces cerevisiae prepro α-mating factor secretion signal sequence. This fused the FRZ domain after the KEX2 (Lys-Arg) and two STE13 (Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala) cleavage sites. Analysis of the culture media of the induced Pichia culture revealed that a protein of ∼35–37 kDa is secreted efficiently, corresponding to an expression level of 20–25 mg/liter. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the secreted protein was Glu-Ala-Glu-Leu-Gly-His-Met-Gly-Phe-Cys-Gln, showing that the secretion signal peptide was cut off at the first STE13 cleavage site, leaving the second Glu-Ala repeat at the N terminus of the secreted protein. Note that the segment of the recombinant protein originating from rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase starts with Gly-Phe-Cys-Gln and terminates with Ile-Gly-Ile-Pro-Met (cf. Fig. 2). The protein purified from the culture media by nickel-agarose chromatography appeared as a diffuse band on SDS-PAGE gels and had a molecular mass of ∼35–37 kDa (Fig. 3), whereas the molecular mass calculated for the amino acid sequence of the recombinant protein was only 18.3 kDa. The FRZ module of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase possesses a potential N-glycosylation site (Asn-Arg-Thr) at Asn184, so we assumed that the higher molecular mass and the heterogeneity seen on SDS-PAGE gels may be due to N-glycosylation at this position. To test this explanation, we have subjected the recombinant protein to endoglycosidase treatment. BecauseP. pastoris synthesizes N-linked glycoproteins with high-mannose-type oligosaccharide side chains (29Grinna L.S. Tschopp J.F. Yeast. 1989; 5: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we treated the secreted protein with endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that cleaves high-mannose-type glycans. Endoglycosidase H treatment has reduced the molecular mass of the recombinant protein to ∼18 kDa (Fig. 3). The endoglycosidase H-treated protein gave a compact, sharp band on SDS-PAGE gels, indicating that the higher molecular mass and size heterogeneity of the recombinant protein were caused by the oligosaccharide side chain. Samples of glycosylated and deglycosylated rat Ror1 FRZ module were first analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy at far-ultraviolet wavelengths (190–250 nm). The two species gave very similar CD spectra, indicating that the N-glycan is not necessary for structural integrity and does not have a major effect on the secondary structural elements of the FRZ fold (Fig.4). Analysis of the CD spectra of the recombinant FRZ module of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase (Fig. 4) predicts 40% β-sheet and 23% α-helix. The presence of both β-sheets and α-helices is consistent with the results of our secondary structure predictions for the FRZ module of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase (Fig. 5) and also seems to be generally valid for the large family of FRZ modules (6Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. Hoffmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem.

B, disulfide bond pattern of the FRZ module as derived from analysis of peptides shown in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further clarify structural characteristics of FRZ modules, we have determined the disulfide bond pattern of the recombinant FRZ domain of Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase. The peptides derived from the recombinant protein by digestion with pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. This analysis identified three disulphide-linked peptides (Fig.6, peaks 20, 24, and25) and allowed unambiguous assignment of disulphide linkages 1–5, 2–4, and 3–8 (Table I). Digestion with pepsin/trypsin/chymotrypsin did not cleave the peptide backbone between the sixth and seventh cysteines and between the ninth and tenth cysteines (fragment in peak 45;cf. Fig. 6 and Table I), therefore the fragment of peak 45 containing these cysteines was digested with V8 protease (Pierce; 2% by weight of peptide) in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.2, at room temperature for 16 h. The reaction mixture was loaded onto the HPLC column, and the resulting peptides were sequenced. Sequence analysis has revealed a 7–9 and 6–10 disulfide bond pattern (TableI). Localization of disulfide bonds thus revealed a pattern with nested disulfide bonds (1–5 and 2–4 and 6–10 and 7–9) both in the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the FRZ module (Fig.5 B). Nevertheless, the fact that these two halves are disulfide-bonded to each other through the third and eighth conserved cysteines argues against the contention that the FRZ module consists of two domains.Table IAmino acid sequence of the disulfide-bonded peptides derived from the FRZ-module of Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase by digestion with pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsinPeptide no.Peptides linked by disulfide bondCysteines connected202–4AIPSLCHYIACAR241–5EAELGHMGFCQPYRPYCDET253–8VLCHTEYIGTSSHLSDKCSQF456, 7, 9, 10SSVPKPRDLCRDECEVLENMRLKLPNCEDLPQPESPEAANCIR45A6–10SSVPKPRDLCRDEAANCIR45B7–9MRLKLPNCECEThe numbers refer to peptides isolated by HPLC as described in Fig. 6.

Peptides 45A and 45B were derived from peptide 45 by digestion with V8 protease. To further clarify whether the FRZ module consists of two domains or corresponds to a single domain, we have subjected the recombinant FRZ module to differential scanning calorimetry. The glycosylated protein had a Tm value of 103 °C (data not shown), and the deglycosylated domain had a Tm value of 84 °C (Fig. 7). Our observation that the N-glycan does not have a major effect on the secondary structure of the protein (Fig. 4) but increases its thermal stability is not unprecedented. Systematic comparison of glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of several proteins (30Wang C. Eufemi M. Turano C. Giartosio A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7299-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) have revealed that deglycosylation decreases thermal stability without a substantial effect on their conformation as indicated by the CD spectra in the ultraviolet range. Thermal unfolding of the deglycosylated FRZ module was fully reversible, the enthalpy change of the unfolding was ΔHcal = 50.5 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. The fact that the FRZ module of rat Ror1 receptor tyrosine kinase collapses with a single Tm value suggests that it corresponds to a single, compact fold, a finding that is not consistent with the suggestion that the FRZ domain could be subdivided into two distinct domains (5Xu Y.K.

We report the functional and regulatory properties of the βS178P mutant. Ser-178 is located at the end of helix 6 of the β subunit, belonging to the domain involved in intersubunit signaling. The carbonyl group of βSer-178 is hydrogen bonded to Gly-181 of loop 6 of the α subunit only when α subunit ligands are bound. An analysis by molecular modeling of the structural effects caused by the βS178P mutation suggests that the hydrogen bond involving αGly-181 is disrupted as a result of localized structural perturbations. The ratio of α to β subunit concentrations was calculated to be 0.7, as for the wild type, indicating the maintenance of a tight α−β complex. Both the activity of the α subunit and the inhibitory effect of the α subunit ligands indole-3-acetylglycine andd,l-α-glycerol-3-phosphate were found to be the same for the mutant and wild type enzyme, whereas the β subunit activity of the mutant exhibited a 2-fold decrease. In striking contrast to that observed for the wild type, the allosteric effectors indole-3-acetylglycine andd,l-α-glycerol-3-phosphate do not affect the β activity. Accordingly, the distribution of l-serine intermediates at the β-site, dominated by the α-aminoacrylate, is only slightly influenced by α subunit ligands. Binding of sodium ions is weaker in the mutant than in the wild type and leads to a limited increase of the amount of the external aldimine intermediate, even at high pH, whereas binding of cesium ions exhibits the same affinity and effects as in the wild type, leading to an increase of the α-aminoacrylate tautomer absorbing at 450 nm. Crystals of the βS178P mutant were grown, and their functional and regulatory properties were investigated by polarized absorption microspectrophotometry. These findings indicate that (i) the reciprocal activation of the α and β activity in the α2β2 complex with respect to the isolated subunits results from interactions that involve residues different from βSer-178 and (ii) βSer-178 is a critical residue in ligand-triggered signals between α and β active sites.

Extensive functional and structural studies of the wild type enzyme and several mutants have unveiled some of the mechanisms underlying catalysis and allosteric regulation (3Miles E.W. in Subcellular Biochemistry.in: Roay S. Biswas B.B. Proteins: Structure, Function and Protein Engineering. Vol. 24. Plenum Press, New York1995: 207-254Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In particular, the β subunit exists either in a closed, catalytically active state, when the α-aminoacrylate is the most populated catalytic intermediate, or in an open, catalytically less active state, when the external aldimine is the predominant species (5Dunn M.F.

When the former intermediate is formed at the β active site, signals are generated that trigger the activation of the α active site, keeping in phase the action of the two sites. Intersubunit communications are mediated by a movable domain of the β subunit, called the COMM1(communication) domain, interacting with the mobile loops 2 and 6 of the α subunit (9Rhee S. Parris D.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). By comparing the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme in the presence and absence of the α subunit ligand 5-fluoroindole-3-propanol phosphate and the α-aminoacrylate species (10Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it was noted that six new polar interactions are formed, five of which are between residues of α loop 2 and β helix 6, and only one is between αGly-181 of loop 6 and βSer-178 of helix 6. Whether there is a unique pathway or multiple specialized pathways of intersubunit communication is not yet known. In fact, the subunit interface mediates i) the 10–100-fold activation of the α and β activity in the α2β2 complex with respect to the isolated subunits, ii) the reciprocal action of α and β subunit ligands on kinetic, thermodynamic, and dynamic properties of the opposite active sites, and iii) pH and monovalent cation modulation of β subunit activity. To gain insight into the role of βSer-178-αGly-181 interaction in regulating the allosteric communication, βSer-178 was mutated to a proline residue. The rationale for the choice of proline was that the interaction between βSer-178 and αGly-181 is mediated by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of βSer-178 and the amidic nitrogen of αGly-181. βSer-178 is not a conserved residue, as demonstrated by a multiple alignment of the amino acid sequence of β subunits from different sources. 2A. Marabotti, unpublished observation. Therefore, proline mutation was chosen for its unique feature of preventing the formation of the hydrogen bond with αGly-181. 3An alternative strategy that can be applied, and that we are pursuing, is to mutate αGly-181 to Pro. Furthermore, to obtain structure and function relationships, crystals of the mutant were grown, and the catalytic competence of the mutant was investigated by polarized absorption microspectrophotometry. All chemicals, obtained from Sigma, except cesium chloride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), were of the best available quality and were used without further purification. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate was obtained from the monobarium salt of the diethyl acetal form, and its concentration was determined using an assay based on the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The stock solution was kept at pH <2 and stored at −20 °C. Oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec. Restriction enzymes and the agarose gel extraction kit were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Ligation was performed by using a DNA ligation system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The β activity assay was carried out as previously described (11Higgins W. Fairwell T. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The buffer for the assay was stored at −20 °C, kept in the dark, and used within 15 days from preparation. The assay for the α subunit reverse activity was carried out in 50 mm bis-Tris propane, 0.2 mm indole, 0.04 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and 0.5 mmglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, pH 7.8, at 20 °C. The assay solution was prepared immediately before use and kept at 4 °C. Measurements were terminated within 1 h from solution preparation. Activity assays were carried out using 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes. Measurements were carried out in a solution containing 25 mm bis-Tris propane in the absence and presence of 50 mml-serine at 20 °C. The final pH was adjusted with concentrated HCl. pH measurements were performed with a Radiometer pHM83 pH meter, equipped with an Ingold-Mettler Lot406-M3 microelectrode. The effect of pH on the equilibrium distribution of catalytic intermediates was measured in a solution containing 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Bicine, 50 mm proline, and 1 mm EDTA (MBP buffer). The pH was raised to 11.5 with concentrated sodium hydroxide and then back-titrated with HCl to the desired pH to keep constant the ionic strength of the buffer in the pH range 6–11. Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out using a Varian Cary400. Spectrofluorimetric measurements were carried out using a PerkinElmer LS50B. Data were analyzed with the software SigmaPlot 6.0 (SPSS Science). Molecular simulations of the site-directed mutagenesis were carried out using SYBYL version 6.5 (Tripos Associates). The Tripos force field was used throughout the calculations. The Ser to Pro mutation was carried out using theBiopolymer option on the tryptophan synthase structure with 5-fluoroindole-3-propanol phosphate bound to the α-subunit, Protein Data Bank file 1a50.pdb (10Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Charges were assigned according to Gasteiger-Huckel, and water molecules present in the Protein Data Bank file were included in the calculations. A first minimization was performed on the mutated amino acid to reduce negative contacts with neighboring residues, and then a second minimization was performed on the α/β interface of the enzyme. The radius of the latter minimized region was 10 Å, centered at the mutation site when all interactions were considered, and 12 Å when only steric interactions were considered. The remaining portion of the protein was kept rigid. The minimizations were performed according to the Powell method. The resulting structure was superimposed on the wild type for evaluating structural changes upon mutation. The bacterial strainEscherichia coli CB149 carrying the plasmid pEBA10 for the expression of tryptophan synthase complex fromSalmonella typhimurium was kindly provided by Dr. E. W. Miles, National Institutes of Health. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension PCR (12Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Snisky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). External primers annealing over the 5′- and 3′-terminal sequences of thetrpB gene in the pEBA10 plasmid were PE1 and PE2, respectively, as described by Yang et al. (13Yang L.-H. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers for βS178P were 5′-CGTAACTACCGGGCCAGTCGC-3′ and its complementary sequence (S178Prev and S178Pfrw, respectively). PCR was performed at 95 °C for 50 s, 62 °C for 50 s, and 74 °C for 60 s, with 2.5 units of Vent polymerase, using plasmid pEBA10 as template. The 570- and 810-base pair products from the first PCR reaction were used as templates in a second PCR with the external primers PE1 and PE2 to generate the complete coding sequence of trpB. The 1100-base pair BglII/XbaI fragment generated from the second PCR was subcloned into pEBA1 and digested with the same restriction enzymes. The newly generated plasmid was used to transform E. coli JM109 and then E. coli CB149. The trpB gene carrying the mutation S178P was fully sequenced. Sequence analysis showed the presence of the correct S178P mutation, as well as an Arg to Ser mutation at position 34 of the amino acid sequence. This mutation was already present in the original plasmid. 4E. W. Miles, personal communication. The growth of the bacterial strain E. coli CB149 containing the plasmid pEBA10, with the mutation S178P in the trpb gene, of theS. typhimurium tryptophan synthase was carried out according to Yang et al. (13Yang L.-H. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purification of the mutant was carried out as described for the wild type (13Yang L.-H. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Enzyme purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the relative amount of α and β subunits was estimated with the program Quantity One 4.0.3 (Bio-Rad). The yield of bacteria growth for the mutant was 1.5 g per 100 ml of culture, about 25% less than the yield for the wild type under our experimental conditions. The amount of purified mutant was 5 mg per g of bacteria, about 10-fold less than for the wild type. The purified enzyme was dialyzed against 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.8, and stored at −80 °C. An aliquot of enzyme solution was extensively dialyzed against 25 mm bis-Tris propane, 10 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, pH 7.8, to remove monovalent cations and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was estimated on the basis of the absorption intensity at 280 nm (14Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Crystals of the mutant were grown according to Schneider et al. (10Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mutant was crystallized using the hanging drop method by mixing 5 μl of a solution containing 10 mg/ml enzyme, 50 mmBicine, pH 7.8, with an equal quantity of reservoir solution containing 50 mm Bicine, 1 mm EDTA, 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 1.4 mm spermine, pH 7.8, at 21 °C. Monoclinic crystals grew within a few days and were stored in a solution containing 50 mm Bicine, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, at 4 °C. Single crystals of βS178P tryptophan synthase were suspended in a solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 50 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 7.8, and mounted in a quartz flow cell. Replacement of the suspending medium was carried out by passing solutions through the cell. The cell was placed on the stage of a Zeiss MPM03 microspectrophotometer, equipped with a 10 × Zeiss UV-visible ultrafluar objective (15Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rossi G.L. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15774-15780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rovegno B. Dalè G. Rossi G.L. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Polarized absorption spectra were collected between 315 and 550 nm with the electric vector of the linearly polarized light parallel to the extinction directions on the (210) flat face of monoclinic crystals. All experiments were carried out at 20 °C. Because the three-dimensional structure of the βS178P mutant tryptophan synthase was not available, a molecular model was created to evaluate the effects of the mutation on the protein conformation. The model was obtained by changing βSer-178 into a proline in the wild type crystallographic structure and performing two energy minimizations of the resulting structure. The comparison of the wild type and mutant (Fig. 2) indicates that the mutation causes only localized structural changes, leading to the loss of the hydrogen bond between βSer-178 and αGly-181. No other significant movements appear to take place either in the α or β subunit. An experimental evaluation of the effect of mutation on the strength of the α−β association was obtained by the quantitative densitometric analysis of the stained bands in the electrophoretic pattern of the purified mutant and wild type protein under denaturing conditions (data not shown). It was found that the ratio of α and β subunit concentrations is 0.7, as for the wild type (17Ogasahara K. Hiraga K. Ito W. Miles E.W. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5222-5228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the mutation does not appreciably affect the intersubunit affinity of the α2β2 mutant complex. The α subunit activity of the mutant was found to be very similar to that of the wild type, and the β subunit activity was about 2-fold lower. Furthermore, the α subunit activity of the mutant was inhibited by the binding of IAG and GP (Fig.3, a and b), as previously observed for the wild type enzyme (18Marabotti A. Cozzini P. Mozzarelli A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The calculated inhibition constants of IAG and GP for the mutant, assuming a single isotherm of binding, are 0.36 ± 0.04 and 12.7 ± 2.9 mm, respectively. The same value was determined for GP in the wild type, and a 3-fold higher value was found for IAG (18Marabotti A. Cozzini P. Mozzarelli A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the mutation does not significantly affect the α active site geometry and does not impair the binding of α subunit ligands. It should be noted that the activity of the mutant at infinite ligand concentrations is not fully abolished, whereas it is fully abolished for the wild type. This finding might be associated with different types of inhibition, as previously observed for indole-3-propanol phosphate, competitive with respect to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and noncompetitive with respect to indole (19Weischet W.O. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to that observed for the wild type, no effect of IAG (18Marabotti A. Cozzini P. Mozzarelli A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and GP (17Ogasahara K. Hiraga K. Ito W. Miles E.W. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5222-5228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on β subunit activity was detected (Fig. 3,c and d), indicating that this feature of the allosteric regulation between α and β subunits is lost in the βS178P mutant. A well characterized effect of the α−β allosteric regulation is the change of the equilibrium distribution of catalytic intermediates at the β active site caused by α subunit ligands (2Miles E.W.

Biochem. 1975; 60: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This distribution is also affected by pH, monovalent cations, and temperature (8Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Specifically, α subunit ligands, low pH, cesium ions, and high temperature stabilize the α-aminoacrylate intermediate, whereas high pH, sodium ions, and low temperature stabilize the external aldimine. Moreover, high pH and monovalent cations favor the accumulation of a quinonoid intermediate (16Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rovegno B. Dalè G. Rossi G.L. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the effect of mutation on the α−β regulation, the influence of α subunit ligands, monovalent cations, and pH on the equilibrium distribution of catalytic intermediates of the β active site was investigated. The absorption spectrum of the mutant enzyme in the absence of ligands (Fig.4 a) exhibits a typical band at 412 nm, assigned to the ketoenamine tautomer of the internal aldimine. The second absorption band at about 330 nm, assigned to the enolimine form of the internal aldimine, is more intense than in the wild type, indicating that the latter tautomer is favored in the mutant. Whenl-serine reacts with the mutant tryptophan synthase in the absence of monovalent cations, at room temperature, pH 7.7, the predominant species is the α-aminoacrylate, mainly absorbing at 350 nm (Fig. 4 b), as observed for the wild type (21Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When a solution of the α-aminoacrylate species was titrated with increasing concentrations of IAG and GP, the band at 350 nm was slightly blue-shifted, and the absorption intensity at 450 nm exhibited a small increase (Fig. 4 b). This band is attributed to the ketoenamine tautomer of the α-aminoacrylate absorbing at 450–470 nm, as observed in O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (22Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolu S. Schnackerz K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and cystathionine β-synthase (23Jhee K.-H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Bruno S. Schiaretti F. Burkhard P. Kraus J.P. Janosik M. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This result indicates a negligible influence of IAG and GP on the equilibrium distribution of β-intermediates. The same negligible effect was detected by monitoring the change of the fluorescence emission at 500 nm upon excitation at 420 nm (data not shown), typical of the external aldimine, the only highly fluorescent species of tryptophan synthase (25Goldberg M.E. York S.S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sodium ions strongly favor the accumulation of the external aldimine species of tryptophan synthase (21Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This behavior was attributed to the stabilization of a partially open conformation of the enzyme (21Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,26Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Binding of sodium ions to the mutant causes a very small increase of the absorption band at 422 nm, assigned to the external aldimine (data not shown). Accordingly, the fluorescence emission at 500 nm is enhanced (Fig. 5 a). The dissociation constant of sodium ions was found to be 153 mm(Fig. 5 b), a value significantly higher than the dissociation constants of 1 and 19 mm previously determined for the wild type (21Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). IAG and GP do not significantly perturb the equilibrium distribution of intermediates also in the presence of saturating concentrations of sodium ions (data not shown). Binding of cesium ions causes similar effects in the mutant and wild type enzyme. The absorption spectra recorded in the presence of cesium ions indicate a small increase of absorption at 440–460 nm (data not shown), indicating a stabilization of the ketoenamine form of the α-aminoacrylate, and a consistent decrease of the fluorescence emission at 500 nm (Fig. 5 a). The extent of spectral changes and the calculated dissociation constant of cesium ions (Fig.5 c) are the same as for the wild type (21Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The equilibrium distribution of intermediates for the mutant enzyme in the presence of sodium ions is affected by pH (Fig.6), as previously observed for the wild type (8Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the pH dependence is different and is not significantly affected by GP, in contrast to that observed for the wild type. Furthermore, the amount of the external aldimine accumulated at high pH is much less than that observed in the wild type (8Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the wild type enzyme the reaction of the α-aminoacrylate with indoline leads to the accumulation of a quinonoid intermediate absorbing at 466 nm (16Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rovegno B. Dalè G. Rossi G.L. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Dunn M.F. Aguilar V. Drewe W.F. Houben K. Robustell B. Roy M. Indian J.

When the βS178P enzyme reacts with indoline, a quinonoid species is formed, and theKd of indoline is similar (data not shown) to that of the wild type (16Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rovegno B. Dalè G. Rossi G.L. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To correlate structural, regulatory, and functional information, crystals of βS178P tryptophan synthase were grown. The crystallization conditions were very similar to those previously used to obtain crystals of the wild type (10Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.-H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The functional and regulatory properties of βS178P crystals were investigated by polarized absorption microspectrophotometry. Polarized absorption spectra of mutant tryptophan synthase crystals were recorded in the presence ofl-serine, with and without sodium ions and with and without IAG (Fig. 7). When l-serine is added to the mutant tryptophan synthase crystals in the absence of cations, the α-aminoacrylate is the predominant species, as in the wild type. The presence of sodium ions causes a significant shift of the equilibrium distribution of intermediates, favoring the accumulation of the external aldimine at a higher concentration than in solution (Fig. 5) but lower than in the wild type enzyme (21Peracchi A.

https://openalex.org/W1969198017,"CTPphosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is the rate-limiting and regulated enzyme of mammalian phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. There are three isoforms, CCTα, CCTβ1, and CCTβ2. The mouse CCTα gene promoter is regulated by an enhancer element (Eb) located between −103 and −82 base pairs (5′-GTTTTCAGGAATGCGGAGGTGG-3′) upstream from the transcriptional start site (Bakovic, M., Waite, K., Tang, W., Tabas, I., and Vance, D. E. (1999) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1436, 147–165). To identify the Eb-binding protein(s), we screened a mouse embryo cDNA library by the yeast one-hybrid system and obtained 19 positive clones. Ten cDNA clones were identified as transcriptional enhancer factor-4 (TEF-4). The TEF-binding consensus sequence, 5′-(A/T)(A/G)(A/G)(A/T)ATG(C/T)(G/A)-3′, was identified within the Eb binding region. Gel-shift analysis using radiolabeled Eb fragment as a probe showed that cell extracts from yeast expressing hemagglutinin-tagged TEF-4 caused a marked band retardation that could be prevented with an anti-hemagglutinin antibody. When COS-7 cells were transfected with TEF-4, CCTα promoter-luciferase reporter activity and CCTα mRNA levels increased. A TEF-4 deletion mutant containing a DNA-binding domain, mTEA(+), stimulated the CCTα promoter activity, whereas protein lacking the DNA binding domain, mTEA(−), did not. Unexpectedly, when the ATG core of the TEF-4 binding consensus within the Eb region was mutated, promoter activity was enhanced rather than decreased. Thus, TEF-4 might act as a dual transcriptional modulator as follows: as a suppressor via its direct binding to the Eb element and as an activator via its interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery. These results provide the first evidence that TEF-4 is an important regulator of CCTα gene expression. phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is the rate-limiting and regulated enzyme of mammalian phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis.

Thus, TEF-4 might act as a dual transcriptional modulator as follows: as a suppressor via its direct binding to the Eb element and as an activator via its interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery. These results provide the first evidence that TEF-4 is an important regulator of CCTα gene expression. In higher eukaryotes, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT)1 is a rate-limiting and regulated enzyme in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (1Kent C. Biochim. Biophys.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1990; 87: 6029-6033Google Scholar). The predicted CCTα structure consists of a nuclear localization signal, a catalytic domain, a helical lipid-binding domain, and a phosphorylation domain (1Kent C. Biochim. Biophys.

All isoforms contain a highly homologous catalytic domain and an amphitropic helical domain that binds lipids (10Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 237: 14022-14029Google Scholar). CCTα and CCTβ2 also contain a highly phosphorylated domain at their carboxyl terminus (1Kent C. Biochim. Biophys.

The roles of individual domains in the regulation of CCTα enzyme activity have been extensively studied. CCTα activity is modulated by the binding of specific lipids to the helical domain (1Kent C.

Chem... 1994; 269: 7544-7551Google Scholar). In addition to regulation at the protein level, CCTα is regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in various cells and tissues. CCTα mRNA was increased in colony-stimulating factor 1-stimulated macrophages (18Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 16261-16264Google Scholar), in hepatic tissues after partial hepatectomy (19Houweling M. Cui Z. Tessitore L. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun... 1996; 229: 158-162Google Scholar). However, the question of whether the elevation of CCTα mRNA levels was due to an increase in transcription or due to stabilization of the produced transcript needs to be further investigated (21Houweling M. Tijburg L.B.M. Vaartjes W.J. Batenburg J.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Van Golde L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem... 1993; 214: 927-933Google Scholar, 22Martina H. Zimmermann L.J. Wang J. Kuliszewski M. Liu J.

Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 13146-13151Google Scholar) isolated the murine CCTα gene (Ctpct) and showed that the exon/intron organization of the gene closely resembles the functional domains of the enzyme. The gene is transcribed from two transcriptional start sites. The 5′ promoter region lacks TATA/CAAT boxes, but contains GC-rich regions. Bakovicet al. (25Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1438: 147-165Google Scholar) demonstrated that three GC regions are regulatory as follows: a “loose” Sp1 site at −31/−9, a cluster of three overlapping Sp1 sites (−88/−50), and a canonical Sp1-binding site (−148/−128). More recently, the same authors showed that transcription factors Sp1 (26Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell.. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Google Scholar, 27Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell.. 1988; 55: 887-898Google Scholar), Sp2 (28Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar), and Sp3 (28Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar) can competitively bind to these regions and that the promoter activity may depend on the relative abundance of those three factors (29Bakovic M. Waite K. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res... 2000; 41: 583-594Google Scholar, 30Lania L. Majello B. DeLuca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol... 1997; 29: 1313-1323Google Scholar). To identify the regulatory elements responsible for CCTα transcription, Bakovic et al. (25Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1438: 147-165Google Scholar) prepared various promoter deletion constructs of Ctpct linked to the luciferase reporter. Subsequent functional assays revealed the presence of regions responsible for basal expression (−52/+38) as well as positive and negative regulatory elements (−201/−90). Furthermore, gel-shift assays indicated several unidentified proteins capable of binding to the region −103/−82, (GTTTTCAGGAATGCGGAGGTGG, Eb) and the neighboring region −130/−103. In this study, we utilized the yeast one-hybrid system (31Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science.. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Google Scholar, 32Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature.. 1993; 364: 121-126Google Scholar) to clone cDNA encoding Eb-binding proteins. One of them was identified as a member of the transcription enhancer factor (TEF) family of proteins, TEF-4 (33Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 18649-18654Google Scholar, 34Jaquemin P. Hwang J.-J. Martial J.A. Dolle P. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 21775-21785Google Scholar). TEF-4 is closely related to TEF-1 that was previously isolated as a regulatory protein of the SV40 enhancer (35Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.-M. Chambon P. Cell.. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar). We report that TEF-4 regulates expression of the CCTα gene in COS-7 and 3T3-L1 cells. MATCHMAKER Yeast One-hybrid System for screening DNA-binding proteins, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YM4271, and the 11-day mouse embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 vector were purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The promoter-less luciferase vector, pGL3-basic, carrying Photinus pyralisluciferase, the control pRL-CMV vector, carrying Renilla reniformis luciferase, and the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). FuGENETM6 transfection reagent, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sigma, and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. COS-7 and 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). 3-Aminotriazole (3-AT) was from Sigma. The triple repeat of Eb (5′-GTTTTCAGGAATGCGGAGGTGG-3′) flanked by an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and byStuI and XbaI sites at the 3′-end (5′-GAATTCGTTTTCAGGAATGCGGAGGTGGGTTTTCAGGAATGCGGAGGTGGGTTTTCAGGAATGCGGAGGTGGAGGCCTCTCGAGTCTAGA-3′), and its complementary sequence, were synthesized by the DNA core facility at the University of Alberta. Two strands (500 pmol each) were annealed in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaCl by heating to 70 °C for 10 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The annealed sequence (3Eb) was digested and inserted between theEcoRI and XbaI sites of the yeast pHIS and pLacZ vectors (CLONTECH) to prepare pHIS-Eb and pLacZ-Eb plasmids, respectively. The correct orientation of 3Eb was ascertained by digestion with StuI and sequencing. pHIS-Eb and pLacZ-Eb were linearized with AflII and NcoI, respectively, and the linearized products were transformed into YM4271 yeast host. Cells were grown in SD/−His or SD/−Ura selective medium, and stable integrants for pHIS-Eb and pLacZ-Eb were isolated and named YHIS-Eb and YLacZ-Eb, respectively. The yeast strain YHIS-Eb was transformed with the pACT2 mouse embryo cDNA library and incubated in SD/−His/−Leu selective medium containing 45 mm 3-AT to suppress completely background growth due to leaky HIS3expression in this reporter strain. The pACT2 cDNA library generates fusions of the cDNA for yeast GAL4 activation domain, the cDNA for a hemagglutinin tag, and a cDNA of encoded proteins. Positive one-hybrid yeast colonies were collected and propagated in 1 ml of SD/−His/−Leu medium at 30 °C overnight. pACT2 plasmids were then isolated using the YEASTMAKER plasmid isolation kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated plasmids were amplified using Electrocomp Transformation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. A total of 19 positive pACT2 clones were obtained and examined. Ten clones were identified to encode TEF-4, presumably an Eb-binding protein, and two of the TEF-4 positive clones, named pY41b and pY51b, were used for further investigation. YLacZ-Eb yeast was transfected with positive TEF-4 plasmids, pY41b and pY51b, or control plasmid pYcont (pACT2 vector) and cultured in SD/−Leu selective media. If bound to the Eb region of the YLacZ-Eb promoter, TEF-4 expressed from pY41b and pY51b would expected to initiate transcription of the yeast β-galactosidase. Formed colonies were streaked on plates with the same selective media and grown for 2 days. Filter paper was placed on the plates, lifted, frozen in liquid nitrogen to break the cell walls, and then thawed on a second filter paper impregnated with β-galactosidase substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indol-β-d-galactopyranoside. The appearance of a blue color indicated a positive interaction of TEF-4 protein with the LacZ-Eb promoter. As a positive control for this assay we used Y53BLUE yeast strain carrying the p53 binding domain in front of the LacZ promoter transformed with the pGAD53m plasmid carrying the p53 protein. As negative controls we used a combination of YlacZ-Eb yeast with pGAD53m and pYcont plasmids or Y53BLUE yeast with pY41b and pY51b plasmids. Various 5′-deleted CCTα promoter regions, LUC.C6 (−2068/−418), LUC.C7 (−1268/+38), LUC.C8 (−201/+38), LUC.D1 (−90/+38), LUC.D2 (−130/+38), and LUC.D3 (−52/+38), inserted into the promoter-less luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega) were prepared as described previously (25Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1438: 147-165Google Scholar). To prepare mutated promoters, the ATG core of the TEF-4 binding region (Eb) was mutated to GCT or AGC (36Jacquemin P. Martial J.A. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 12928-12937Google Scholar). These mutations were created from a single-stranded −1268/+38 promoter isolated from LUC.C7 after ligation into pBluescript II SK (−) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described (37Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). The mutated promoter was either directly ligated back into pGL3-basic vector to prepare LUC.C7m and LUC.C7m2 or digested before ligation to prepare LUC.C8m as reported (25Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1438: 147-165Google Scholar). TEF-4 mammalian expression plasmid pcTEF-4 was prepared by digesting pY41b plasmid, encoding the full-length TEF-4, with EcoRI and XhoI and ligating the fragment into pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To prepare a TEF-4 deletion mutant, the EcoRI/XhoI fragment obtained from pY41b was ligated into pBluescript II SK(−) to obtain TEF-4 SK(−). TEF-4 SK(−) was then digested with NcoI andAatII, and the sticky ends were blunted by T4 DNA polymerase and ligated to make a deleted TEF-4. This construct contained the TEA-DNA binding domain, encoding the first 171 amino acids plus 5 additional amino acids, CTTRR, at its carboxyl terminus. The sequence was then digested from the pBluescript vector and ligated into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His mammalian expression vector to make a pcmTEA(+) plasmid. To prepare a second TEF-4 mutant, TEF-4 SK(−) was digested with BalI and BamHI and then the sticky ends were blunted and ligated. This procedure generated a construct of TEF-4 without the TEA-DNA binding domain, i.e. lacking amino-terminal amino acids 5–133. The deleted TEF-4 fragment was isolated from the vector using EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into pcDNA3.1/V5-His to make the pcmTEA(−) expression plasmid. COS-7 and 3T3-L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (1 × 105) were plated on 35-mm plates (Falcon-Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and grown overnight. Three μl of FuGENETM6 was suspended in 100 μl of serum-free medium and mixed with 0.5 μg of the CCTα promoter-luciferase constructs (see above), 0.001 μg of pRL-CMV Renilla vector as a transfection control, and 0.5 μg of either pcTEF-4, pcmTEA(−), pcmTEA(+) or pcDNA control. Transfection was initiated by dropwise addition of DNA suspensions to the cell culture. Forty eight hours later cells were harvested, lysed in 200 μl of the Passive lysis buffer (Promega), and 10 μl of the cell lysate was used for the dual-luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by using the ratio of the activities obtained with the CCTα promoter deletion constructs (see above) and the pRL-CMV construct carrying the cytomegalovirus promoter-luciferase fusion. TEF-4-positive yeast, Y41b, was cultured in 15 ml of SD/−His/−Leu medium containing 45 mm 3-AT. After 48 h, 12 ml of the late log-phase culture was transferred into 100 ml of the same medium and cultured for an additional 36 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 m β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol). After vortexing with glass beads to break the cell walls, the cells were subjected 3 times to freezing and thawing and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove the cell debris (38Arndt K.T. Styles C. Fink G.R. Science.. 1987; 237: 874-880Google Scholar). The yeast transformed with pYcont were cultured in SD/−Leu medium and treated in a similar manner to obtain control cell extracts. Nuclear extracts from mammalian cells were prepared according to Andrews and Faller (39Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res... 1991; 19: 2499Google Scholar) with minor modification (25Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1438: 147-165Google Scholar). Full-length TEF-4 cDNA was digested from pY41b with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the pGEX-KG (Promega) vector to obtain the pGST-TEF-4 expression plasmid. pGST-TEF-4 or control vector were transformed intoEscherichia coli strain HB101 and grown in Luria broth overnight. The cultures were subsequently transferred to 10 volumes of growth media and grown for 1 h. Isopropyl-β-d-(−)-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the incubation was continued for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.02% Triton X-100), sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. To obtain purified proteins, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-TEF-4 and GST proteins were eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The opposite strands of Eb, mutated Eb (5′-GTGGTTTTCAGGAGCTCGGAGGTGGCATT-3′, Ebm) and the SV-40 GT-IIC enhanson (5′-ACCAGCTGTGGAATGTGTGTCGA-3′), 500 pmol each, were annealed (70 °C, 10 min) in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaCl and then cooled to room temperature. An aliquot (10 pmol) of the double-stranded oligonucleotides was 5′-end-labeled with [32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A DNA protein-binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in 40 μl of 1× binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 μl of the radiolabeled probe (50,000–80,000 cpm), and one of the following: yeast cell extracts, mammalian nuclear extracts, purified GST-TEF-4 or GST proteins. In some cases, unlabeled double-stranded Eb (100-fold molar excess), anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was included in the incubation mixture. The reaction was stopped by addition of 4 μl of 6× DNA loading buffer. The labeled probe was separated from DNA-protein complexes by electrophoresis on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C until the xylene cyanol dye reached 5 cm from the bottom of the gel. Autoradiography was carried out by exposure of the gel to Kodak X-Omat XAR2 film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 16–48 h. COS-7 cells were transformed with pcTEF-4 or pcDNA as described above. After being cultured for 48 h, the cells were treated with Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and total RNA was extracted. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 60 °C for 30 min and then subjected to 20 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 60 °C for 1.5 min) using the one-step RT-PCR kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The primers used for CCTα were 5′-ATGCACAGTGTTCAGCCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGCTTACTAAAGTCAACTTCAA-3′ (antisense). Primers for glycero-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (antisense). The intensities of the CCTα bands were normalized to those of the G3PDH bands using the Quantity One software (PDI, Huntington Station, NY). All values are expressed as means ± S.D. Group means were compared by Student's t test or the Cochran-Cox test after analysis of variance to determine the significance of difference between the individual means. Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. A yeast integrant (YHIS-Eb) carrying three repeats of Eb in the front of the his3 coding region was constructed and used to screen for the Eb-binding proteins and promoter activation by the one-hybrid expression system. The Yhis-Eb yeast strain was transformed with the pACT2 mouse embryo cDNA library encoding fusions of the yeast gal4activation domain, a cDNA of an unknown protein, and a hemagglutinin tag at its 5′-end. The yeast transformation efficiency was 1 × 104 colony-forming units/μg as determined on SD/−Leu selective medium. After screening 1.5 × 106 colonies, 19 positive clones were obtained that were able to grow on the SD/−His/−Leu selective medium containing 45 mm 3-AT. Of the cDNAs obtained from those yeast clones, 10/19 encoded transcriptional enhancer factor-4 (33Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol.

Since we found that the TEF-binding consensus (35Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.-M. Chambon P. Cell.. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar), 5′-(A/T)(A/G)(A/G)(A/T) ATG (C/T)(G/A)-3′ was present in the Eb promoter region, we decided to focus on TEF-4 and further analyze its role in CCTα gene transcription. We selected the clones pY41b and pY51b, isolated from the yeast Y41b and Y51b, that encoded the full-length or almost full-length TEF-4 (pY41b from the position −24 and pY51b from the position +94 relative to the translation start codon). To confirm that TEF-4 clones can drive transcription of other yeast genes carrying the Eb sequence in their promoters, the yeast integrant YLacZ-Eb carrying a 3-fold repeat of Eb followed by the β-galactosidase lacZ gene was transformed with pY41b, pY51b plasmids, or pYcont (pACT2 vector), cultured on SD/−Leu selective medium, and tested for the expression of β-galactosidase. Formed colonies were examined for β-galactosidase by the colony-lift filter assay. The colonies of YLacZ-Eb transformed with pY41b and pY51b expressed β-galactosidase and turned blue in the presence of the β-galactosidase substrate. However, the colonies of YLacZ-Eb transformed with either pGAD53m encoding a fusion of p53 with theGAL4 activation domain (which does not bind to the Eb region) or the pYcont empty vector, did not yield blue colonies, as expected. We next used Y53BLUE yeast strain that carried the p53-binding sequence in front of lacZ as a positive control. Y53BLUE transformed with pGAD53m plasmid expressed β-galactosidase and the colonies turned blue. When the Y53BLUE yeast was transformed with plasmids pY41b and pY51b encoding TEF-4, which does not bind to the p53 sites, or with the empty vector pYcont, no blue color was obtained. The untransformed YLacZ-Eb or Y53BLUE yeast produced a similar negative response. Together, these results indicate that pY41b and pY51b encodes TEF-4 that binds to the Eb region of heterologous yeast promoters and drives transcription of the his3and lacZ genes. The results also confirm the validity of the TEF-4 clones and their expression. To confirm the binding of TEF-4 to the Eb region, we performed gel-shift analysis using the radiolabeled Eb oligonucleotide as a probe. The labeled Eb fragment was incubated with cell extracts isolated from the yeast expressing TEF-4 (Y41b) or control (Ycont), and DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1 A). When Y41b extract was used, two slower migrating bands in addition to the faster moving probe were observed (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The intensities of the two slower bands were markedly decreased after competition with a large excess of unlabeled probe (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), suggesting that both originated from a protein that binds to Eb. However, the lower band was also visible in the experiments with control yeast extracts (Fig.2 A, lane 3) indicating that only the upper band was specific for TEF-4/DNA binding. This was further confirmed by a competition experiment with an antibody specific for the hemagglutinin tag, which was part of the TEF-4 fusion protein. When various amounts of the anti-hemagglutinin antibody were added to the reaction mixture, the intensity of the upper band decreased, whereas the intensity o"

Here, we report that Me2SO affects splice site selection on model pre-mRNAs incubated in a nuclear extract prepared from HeLa cells. A shift toward the proximal pair of splice sites was observed on pre-mRNAs carrying competing 5′-splice sites or competing 3′-splice sites. Because the activity of recombinant hnRNP A1 protein was similar when added to extracts containing or lacking Me2SO, the activity of endogenous A1 proteins is probably not affected by Me2SO. Notably, in a manner reminiscent of SR proteins, Me2SO activated splicing in a HeLa S100 extract. Moreover, the activity of recombinant SR proteins in splice site selection in vitro was improved by Me2SO. Polar solvents like DMF and formamide similarly modulated splice site selection in vitro but formamide did not activate a HeLa S100 extract.

Biol. 1983; 3: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Whether any of the above changes result from a direct effect of Me2SO on RNA synthesis, maturation, and/or stability is currently unknown.Because treating cells with Me2SO can have a strong effect on the alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs and because the mechanism of action of Me2SO remains unclear, we performed a series of experiments in nuclear extracts to assess whether Me2SO directly affects the activity of the splicing machinery. We find that Me2SO can have drastic effects both on 5′-splice site and on 3′-splice site selection in vitro. Notably, other solvents of the same category (e.g. DMF and formamide) also perturb splice site selection.DISCUSSIONWe have observed that the addition of Me2SO to nuclear extracts can have strong effects on splice site selection while having minimal effects on the efficiency of splicing. In contrast, the addition of Me2SO to a splicing-deficient HeLa S100 extract stimulated splicing in a manner reminiscent of the activity of SR proteins. The effect of Me2SO on splice site selection was also similar to the activity of SR proteins because Me2SO shifted selection toward the proximal pair of splice sites. Consistent with the notion Me2SO stimulates the activity of SR proteins, we found that the combination of Me2SO and SRp30c produces a shift that is greater than the sum of their individual contribution. Thus, a general stimulation in the activity of all endogenous SR proteins most probably explains why Me2SO influences splice site choice in vitro. Likewise, the addition of Me2SO to a S100 extract may stimulate the residual amounts of SR proteins present in this extract.An additional mechanism by which Me2SO may affect splice site selection is through the inactivation of the hnRNP A/B proteins, which are known to antagonize the activity of SR proteins in splice site selection (36, 37). However, we have observed that the activity of recombinant hnRNP A1 proteins in splice site selection is not affected by the presence of Me2SO. This result suggests that the activity of endogenous A1 proteins is probably not affected by Me2SO.Because Me2SO, DMF, and formamide decrease the melting temperature of DNA and RNA duplexes, it is possible that changes in 5′-splice site selection may be caused by the weakening of the base pairing interactions between U1 snRNA and 5′-splice sites. However, this explanation is unlikely for the following reasons. First, a reduction in U1 snRNP binding should lead to more distal 5′-splice site utilization, as is the case when U1 activity is reduced through oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H digestion (data not shown). Moreover, increased selection of a proximal 5′-splice site is associated with improved U1 snRNP binding (38Eperon I.C. Ireland D.C. Smith R.A. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3607-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Second, splice site selection on a transcript that is normally spliced to a distal 5′-splice site because of a duplex structure in the pre-mRNA was insensitive to Me2SO. 2M. Cordeau and B. Chabot, unpublished results. Thus, the effect of Me2SO, formamide and DMF on 5′-splice site selection cannot be explained by a reduction in the stability of base pairing interactions. However, it is possible that this denaturing activity contributes to the reduction in overall splicing activity observed at higher concentrations of solvents.Although our results suggest that Me2SO affects the activity of SR proteins, the mechanism by which SR proteins become activated remains unclear. Western analysis using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated epitopes on SR proteins revealed no change in the overall and relative abundance of phosphorylated SR proteins upon incubation with Me2SO (data not shown). Moreover, Me2SO did not affect the binding of SR proteins to a purine-rich RNA splicing enhancer element (data not shown). Me2SO also did not modify the solubility of SR proteins when extracts were incubated with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 (data not shown). Although Me2SO is regarded as a relatively inert solvent for pharmacological applications, it improves the solvation of cations and stimulates nucleophilic reactions. DMF and formamide share with Me2SO this chemical property. Thus, one possibility is that Me2SO improves the solvation of positive charges on proteins. This may influence the structure at the surface of proteins and facilitate ionic contacts between charged domains of interacting proteins. Consistent with this view, modulation of 5′-splice site selection in vitro is known to be sensitive to the ionic conditions of the reaction (39Schmitt P. Gattoni R. Keohavong P. Stevenin J. Cell. 1987; 50: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Splicing proteins that carry charged domains include SR and U2AF proteins, which have RS-domains rich in positively and negatively charged amino acids (arginines and phosphorylated serines, respectively). Interactions between the RS-domain containing proteins ASF/SF2, U1 snRNP-70 kDa, and U2AF35 have been proposed to occur early during spliceosome assembly (40Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Moreover, these interactions are sensitive to the phosphorylation state of ASF/SF2 (41Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, Me2SO may activate splicing in a S100 extract by improving the quality of the ionic interactions between residual amounts of SR and U2AF proteins. Because the amount and activity of these proteins are in excess in a nuclear extract, this would explain why Me2SO stimulates generic splicing in a S100 but not in a nuclear extract.Even though nuclear extracts contain sufficient amounts of SR proteins for generic splicing, their activity in splice site selection is not maximal because adding more SR proteins can have a strong effect on the selection of splice sites (32Ge H. Manley J.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 25-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 33Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Cell. 1990; 62: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Because a similar effect can be obtained by adding kinases that phosphorylate the RS domains of SR proteins (42Prasad J. Colwill K. Pawson T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6991-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the profile of charged residues at the surface of SR proteins is crucial for their activity as splicing regulators. Moreover, the requirement for charged residues at the surface of SR proteins appears different for generic and alternative splicing because dephosphorylation of ASF/SF2 is essential for constitutive splicing, but is not required for the protein to function as a splicing regulator (41Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, Me2SO may affect the presentation of charged residues that are important for the activity of SR proteins in splice site selection. Because Me2SO and DMF activate splicing in a HeLa S100 extract, Me2SO and DMF may also affect the presentation of different residues that are important for generic splicing. In contrast, because formamide affects splice site selection but cannot activate a S100 extract, formamide may only affect the presentation of residues that play a role in splice site selection.Our results raise the possibility that the documented effect of Me2SO on cell differentiation may be caused, at least in part, by changes in the activity of SR proteins, which in turn affect splice site selection. This conclusion is supported by the observation that DMF can mimic the effect of Me2SO both in differentiation assays (5Blau H.M. Epstein C.J. Cell. 1979; 17: 95-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Pise C.A. Newburger P.E. Holland C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 3257-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 44Shen Q. Chada S. Whitney C. Newburger P.E. Blood. 1994; 84: 3902-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hoosein N.M. Brattain D.E. McKnight M.K. Brattain M.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and in splicing assays in vitro. Depending on the cell types, Me2SO can either promote or block differentiation or apoptosis. These opposite outcomes may be explained if different subsets of pre-mRNAs are expressed in different cell types. For example, alternative splicing is often used to control the production of proteins involved in programmed cell death such as Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, and Ced-4 (46Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, Me2SO may alter the alternative splicing of a pre-mRNA to favor the production of a repressor protein in one cell type, while an inducer may be produced from another gene in a different cell type. Me2SO1 is a polar solvent used to promote cell differentiation of tumor cell lines. For example, the treatment of mouse erythroleukemic and neuroblastoma cells with 2% Me2SO induces morphological changes and differentiation in red blood cells and neurons, respectively (e.g. see Refs. 1Yenofsky R.

This result suggests that the activity of endogenous A1 proteins is probably not affected by Me2SO.Because Me2SO, DMF, and formamide decrease the melting temperature of DNA and RNA duplexes, it is possible that changes in 5′-splice site selection may be caused by the weakening of the base pairing interactions between U1 snRNA and 5′-splice sites. However, this explanation is unlikely for the following reasons. First, a reduction in U1 snRNP binding should lead to more distal 5′-splice site utilization, as is the case when U1 activity is reduced through oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H digestion (data not shown). Moreover, increased selection of a proximal 5′-splice site is associated with improved U1 snRNP binding (38Eperon I.C. Ireland D.C. Smith R.A. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3607-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Second, splice site selection on a transcript that is normally spliced to a distal 5′-splice site because of a duplex structure in the pre-mRNA was insensitive to Me2SO. 2M. Cordeau and B. Chabot, unpublished results. Thus, the effect of Me2SO, formamide and DMF on 5′-splice site selection cannot be explained by a reduction in the stability of base pairing interactions. However, it is possible that this denaturing activity contributes to the reduction in overall splicing activity observed at higher concentrations of solvents.Although our results suggest that Me2SO affects the activity of SR proteins, the mechanism by which SR proteins become activated remains unclear. Western analysis using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated epitopes on SR proteins revealed no change in the overall and relative abundance of phosphorylated SR proteins upon incubation with Me2SO (data not shown). Moreover, Me2SO did not affect the binding of SR proteins to a purine-rich RNA splicing enhancer element (data not shown). Me2SO also did not modify the solubility of SR proteins when extracts were incubated with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 (data not shown). Although Me2SO is regarded as a relatively inert solvent for pharmacological applications, it improves the solvation of cations and stimulates nucleophilic reactions. DMF and formamide share with Me2SO this chemical property. Thus, one possibility is that Me2SO improves the solvation of positive charges on proteins. This may influence the structure at the surface of proteins and facilitate ionic contacts between charged domains of interacting proteins. Consistent with this view, modulation of 5′-splice site selection in vitro is known to be sensitive to the ionic conditions of the reaction (39Schmitt P. Gattoni R. Keohavong P. Stevenin J. Cell. 1987; 50: 31-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Splicing proteins that carry charged domains include SR and U2AF proteins, which have RS-domains rich in positively and negatively charged amino acids (arginines and phosphorylated serines, respectively). Interactions between the RS-domain containing proteins ASF/SF2, U1 snRNP-70 kDa, and U2AF35 have been proposed to occur early during spliceosome assembly (40Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Moreover, these interactions are sensitive to the phosphorylation state of ASF/SF2 (41Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, Me2SO may activate splicing in a S100 extract by improving the quality of the ionic interactions between residual amounts of SR and U2AF proteins. Because the amount and activity of these proteins are in excess in a nuclear extract, this would explain why Me2SO stimulates generic splicing in a S100 but not in a nuclear extract.Even though nuclear extracts contain sufficient amounts of SR proteins for generic splicing, their activity in splice site selection is not maximal because adding more SR proteins can have a strong effect on the selection of splice sites (32Ge H. Manley J.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 25-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 33Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Cell. 1990; 62: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Because a similar effect can be obtained by adding kinases that phosphorylate the RS domains of SR proteins (42Prasad J. Colwill K. Pawson T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6991-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the profile of charged residues at the surface of SR proteins is crucial for their activity as splicing regulators. Moreover, the requirement for charged residues at the surface of SR proteins appears different for generic and alternative splicing because dephosphorylation of ASF/SF2 is essential for constitutive splicing, but is not required for the protein to function as a splicing regulator (41Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, Me2SO may affect the presentation of charged residues that are important for the activity of SR proteins in splice site selection. Because Me2SO and DMF activate splicing in a HeLa S100 extract, Me2SO and DMF may also affect the presentation of different residues that are important for generic splicing. In contrast, because formamide affects splice site selection but cannot activate a S100 extract, formamide may only affect the presentation of residues that play a role in splice site selection.Our results raise the possibility that the documented effect of Me2SO on cell differentiation may be caused, at least in part, by changes in the activity of SR proteins, which in turn affect splice site selection. This conclusion is supported by the observation that DMF can mimic the effect of Me2SO both in differentiation assays (5Blau H.M. Epstein C.J. Cell. 1979; 17: 95-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 43Pise C.A. Newburger P.E. Holland C.A. J. Gen.

Brattain D.E. McKnight M.K. Brattain M.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and in splicing assays in vitro. Depending on the cell types, Me2SO can either promote or block differentiation or apoptosis. These opposite outcomes may be explained if different subsets of pre-mRNAs are expressed in different cell types. For example, alternative splicing is often used to control the production of proteins involved in programmed cell death such as Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, and Ced-4 (46Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, Me2SO may alter the alternative splicing of a pre-mRNA to favor the production of a repressor protein in one cell type, while an inducer may be produced from another gene in a different cell type. We have observed that the addition of Me2SO to nuclear extracts can have strong effects on splice site selection while having minimal effects on the efficiency of splicing. In contrast, the addition of Me2SO to a splicing-deficient HeLa S100 extract stimulated splicing in a manner reminiscent of the activity of SR proteins. The effect of Me2SO on splice site selection was also similar to the activity of SR proteins because Me2SO shifted selection toward the proximal pair of splice sites. Consistent with the notion Me2SO stimulates the activity of SR proteins, we found that the combination of Me2SO and SRp30c produces a shift that is greater than the sum of their individual contribution. Thus, a general stimulation in the activity of all endogenous SR proteins most probably explains why Me2SO influences splice site choice in vitro. Likewise, the addition of Me2SO to a S100 extract may stimulate the residual amounts of SR proteins present in this extract. An additional mechanism by which Me2SO may affect splice site selection is through the inactivation of the hnRNP A/B proteins, which are known to antagonize the activity of SR proteins in splice site selection (36, 37).

First, retinol is converted into retinal by a retinol dehydrogenase, and, subsequently, retinoic acid is formed by a retinal dehydrogenase. In vitro, several enzymes are suggested to act in this metabolic pathway. However, little is known regarding their capacity to contribute to retinoic acid biosynthesis in vivo. We have developed a versatile cell reporter system to analyze the role of several of these enzymes in 9-cis-retinoic acid biosynthesis in vivo. Using a Gal4-retinoid X receptor fusion protein-based luciferase reporter assay, the formation of 9-cis-retinoic acid from 9-cis-retinol was measured in cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding different combinations of retinol and retinal dehydrogenases. The results suggested that efficient formation of 9-cis-retinoic acid required co-expression of retinol and retinal dehydrogenases. Interestingly, the cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase 4 failed to efficiently catalyze 9-cis-retinol oxidation. A structure-activity analysis showed that mutants of two retinol dehydrogenases, devoid of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tails, displayed greatly reduced enzymatic activities in vivo, but were active in vitro. The cytoplasmic tails mediate efficient endoplasmic reticulum localization of the enzymes, suggesting that the unique milieu in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment is necessary forin vivo activity of microsomal retinol dehydrogenases.

The metabolically active retinoids are 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA)1 and all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) in extraocular tissues, acting as ligands for two classes of nuclear retinoid receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (4Mangelsdorf D.J.

In ocular tissues, 11-cis-retinal serves as the chromophore of the visual pigments (2Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar). Most cells obtain all-trans-retinol as the main source of retinoids, and it is known that activation of retinol into the active metabolites occur via tissue-specific isomerization and oxidation reactions. First, 9-cis-, 11-cis-, or all-trans-retinols are oxidized by retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) into the corresponding retinals. For generation of the two isomers of RA, 9-cis- and all-trans-retinal are then further oxidized by a class of retinal dehydrogenases (Raldhs) (for reviews, see Refs. 5Napoli J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 139-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 6Duester G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12221-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that oxidation of the two isomers of retinol are the rate-limiting factors in the pathways generating 9cRA and atRA. Two classes of RDHs have been implicated in oxidation of the different stereo isomers of retinol, i.e. microsomal members of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductases, and the cytosolic medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Several members of both classes of enzymes can oxidize different stereo isomers of retinol in vitro. However, the physiological roles of these enzymes in retinoid biosynthesis are not well understood. The first identified member of the microsomal RDHs was RDH5, an enzyme abundantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium with ability to convert 11-cis-retinol (7Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and othercis-retinols (8Mertz J.R. Shang E.Y. Piantedosi R. Wei S.H.

RDH5 is a homodimeric integral membrane protein anchored to the lipid bilayer via an amino-terminal signal anchor peptide and a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane segment. The catalytic domain of the enzyme is lumenal and only the extreme carboxyl-terminal 6–8 amino acid residues reside in the cytosol (16Simon A. Romert A. Gustafsson A.-L. McCaffrey J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Romert A. Tuvendal P. Tryggvason K. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (the RDH4 enzyme has been renamed to RDH5 to indicate that it is the murine counterpart of RDH5). Genetic evidence for a role of the microsomal RDHs in ocular retinoid metabolism comes from the identification of mutations in RDH5 in patients suffering from fundus albipunctatus (19Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20Gonzalez-Fernandez F. Kurz D. Bao Y. Newman S. Conway B.P. Young J.E. Han D.P. Khani S.C. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 41-47PubMed Google Scholar). These patients have a reduced rate of synthesis of 11-cis-retinal resulting in accumulation of white spots in the retina and stationary night blindness. These results suggest a physiological role of RDH5 in oxidation of 11-cis-retinol into 11-cis-retinal in the visual cycle. Surprisingly, mice carrying targeted deletion of the RDH5 gene do not display similar symptoms (21Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P. Van Vugt A.H. Van Hooser J.P. Wieringa B.E. Deutman A.F. Palczewski K. Ruether K. Janssen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4275-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Studies on mice carrying target deletions in the genes encoding ADH1 and ADH4 do not show any obvious phenotypes related to altered metabolism of endogenous retinoids (22Deltour L. Foglio M.H.

Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Instead, these data provide compelling evidence suggesting that ADH1 and ADH4 may not be critically required in generation of RA in vivo. In this study we have analyzed the ability of various enzymes, suggested to play a role in RA biosynthesis, to contribute to generation of 9cRA from 9cROL in a cell reporter assay. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that the unique milieu in the ER is necessary for efficient generation of 9cRA in vivo. JEG-3 cells, COS-1 cells, and 293 cells were maintained in either minimum essential medium (for JEG-3; Life Technologies, Inc.) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for 293 and COS-1; Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (24Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The transfections were performed in 24-well plates, each experiment as triplicates using either minimum essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. The cDNAs encoding the enzymes were cloned into the expression plasmid CMX-PL1 (a kind gift from Dr. T. Perlmann).

Original retinal dehydrogenase plasmids were kind gifts from Dr. Joseph Napoli. Unless otherwise indicated, medium with 1 μm9-cis-retinol (9cROL) or 9-cis-retinal (9cRAL) was separately added to the cells after 6 h of incubation with the calcium phosphate precipitate, and 1 μm SR11237 was used as a positive control (26Lehmann J.M.

For the titration experiment, 0.1–50 μm 9cROL, 9cRAL, all-trans-retinol (atROL), or all-trans-retinal (atRAL) were used. Medium without added ligand served as a negative control. After an additional 18 h, the cells were lysed and their luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured with a luminometer (Lucy-1, Anthos, Saltzburg, Austria) as described previously (24Perlmann T.

All luciferase values were normalized to the internal β-galactosidase control, and the maximal relative activation was set to 100%. The assays were performed several times with similar results, and each data point represents the mean of triplicate analyses. Mouse CRAD1 and RDH5 cDNAs in pBluescriptSK− (Stratagene) were used to produce single-stranded DNA with the helper phage M13KO7 (27Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). All mutations were made with oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis without phenotypic selection (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides, with mutated nucleotide(s) underlined, were as follows; 5′-TTT GGT GGT GGT TTC TGC ATC TCT AAG (CRAD1, changing the tyrosine in the active site to phenylalanine, Y175F), 5′-TGG GAT GCT AAGTGA TTC TAC CTC CCC (CRAD1, inserting a premature stop codon before the COOH-terminal transmembrane region, L289Stop), 5′-TGG ACT TCC CTG TGA CCT GAA AAA GCC (CRAD1, inserting a premature stop codon 6 amino acids before the normal stop codon thus deleting the cytosolic COOH-terminal R312Stop), and 5′-ACC TGG ATC CTT CCC TGA CCC GCC CAG TCA GTC (RDH5, inserting a premature stop codon 7 amino acids before the normal stop codon thus deleting the cytosolic COOH-terminal tail, R312Stop). The mutations were verified by sequencing. Mutated plasmids were digested with EcoRI, the inserts were cloned into the eucaryotic expression vector CMX-PL1, and the enzymatic activities of the mutants were analyzed. Wild-type and mutant forms of CRAD1 and RDH5 were expressed in transfected COS-1 cells essentially as described (7Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Isolated microsomes from the transfected cells, and from mock-transfected cells, were collected and used in further analyses. The in vitro activity analyses were done essentially as described previously (19Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) using 9cROL as a substrate. A Waters Alliance 2690 HPLC system connected to a C18 reversed-phase column (Supelco; 4.6 × 250 mm) was used. 9cROL was a kind gift from Dr. Michael Klaus (Hoffman-La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland). The membrane topology of CRAD1 was determined using limited proteolysis as described previously (16Simon A. Romert A. Gustafsson A.-L. McCaffrey J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially, microsomes (total 10 μg of protein) were incubated with 20 μg/μl proteinase K, with or without 1% Triton X-100 treatment. Reactions were stopped after 5, 15, 25, and 45 min with the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 2 mm. Samples were prepared and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CRAD1 was detected using an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit Ig fraction (see below). After extensive washings, bound Ig was detected by ECL using Hyperfilm ECL chemiluminescence film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and developed. Cellular expression of RDH5 and ADH4 was verified by immunoblotting essentially as outlined above. Expression of CRAD2 and CRADL was verified by RT-PCR of total RNA fractions using oligo(dT) priming. The oligonucleotides 5′-TCT CTC TGC TTG ACT TCT ACA A and 5′-TTG GTG ACA TCC AGG ATC were used to amplify a 282-base pair fragment corresponding to CRAD2, and the oligonucleotides 5′-TGG GGT GAA GGT GGC TAT TAT and 5′-TCT GCA CCC TCA CAC AGC ACT were used to amplify a 418-base pair fragment corresponding to CRADL. As negative controls aliquots of the isolated total RNA fractions, without oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription, were subjected to PCR amplifications using the above primer pairs. As positive controls, the corresponding expression plasmids were including as templates. The amplified products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. Polyclonal rabbit antisera to CRAD1 were generated by immunizing rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 19–288 of CRAD1, essentially as described for the production of rabbit antisera to RDH5 (17Romert A. Tuvendal P. Tryggvason K. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For affinity purification, the rabbit antisera were passed over columns containing the CRAD1-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose, and bound Ig was eluted and characterized. The rabbit antibodies to RDH5 have been described previously (17Romert A. Tuvendal P. Tryggvason K. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the rabbit antiserum to human ADH4 was a kind gift from Dr. Jan-Olov Höög. Immunofluorescence localization of CRAD1 and RDH5 was done using transfected CHO cells as described previously (17Romert A. Tuvendal P. Tryggvason K. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Texas Red-labeled concanavalin A, Texas Red-labeled wheat germ agglutinin, and rhodamine-labeled phalloidin were used as suggested by the supplier (Molecular Probes). Three different cell lines, JEG-3 cells, COS-1 cells, and 293 cells, were separately transfected with expression plasmids encoding the cis-retinol-specific dehydrogenase CRAD1 and the retinal dehydrogenase Raldh2 in an attempt to reconstruct a metabolic pathway able to generate 9cRA from 9cROL. Formation of 9cRA was monitored by co-transfecting the cells with plasmids encoding a Gal4-RXR-based luciferase reporter system (24Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The induction of luciferase activity was subsequently measured following addition of 9cROL to a final concentration of 1 μm. The results showed that all three cell lines efficiently converted 9cROL to 9cRA when co-expressing CRAD1 and Raldh2 (data shown for JEG-3 cells only) (Fig. 1 A). In cells expressing only one of the two types of dehydrogenases, addition of 9cROL did not generate significant amounts of 9cRA. Addition of 9cRAL induced reporter gene activation in cells expressing Raldh2, either alone or in combination with CRAD1. Mock-transfected cells failed to efficiently generate 9cRA upon addition of 9cROL or 9cRAL (data not shown). The ability of the synthetic RXR agonist SR11237 to induce reporter gene activation in cells expressing all combinations of the two types of dehydrogenases confirmed that the transfected cells were able to respond to the presence of ligand. These data suggest that cellular components necessary for activity of the involved enzymes in this coupled enzyme-reporter system are present in several cell types and may be ubiquitously expressed. The dose-response characteristics of transfected JEG-3 cells, expressing both enzymes, were measured by addition of different concentrations of 9cROL, 9cRAL, atROL, and atRA (ranging between 0.1 and 50 μm for the 9-cis-retinoids and between 0.1 and 10 μm for the all-trans-retinoids). The results showed that maximal reporter gene activation was achieved between 1 and 10 μm 9cROL, and between 0.5 and 5 μm 9cRAL. At higher retinoid concentrations, reporter gene activation was less effective probably due to the toxic effects of high concentrations of retinoids. All tested concentrations of atROL and atRAL failed to induce efficient reporter gene activation (Fig.1 B). The results are consistent with the notion that neither of the all-trans-retinoids are efficiently converted into the corresponding 9-cis-retinoids in vivo. To analyze the capacity of different retinol dehydrogenases with ability to oxidize 9cROL in vitro, RDH5 (17Romert A. Tuvendal P. Tryggvason K. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Romert A. Tuvendal P. Simon A. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 4404-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), CRAD1 (13Chai X.Y. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), CRAD2 (14Su J. Chai X. Kahn B. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17910-17916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a novel CRAD-like enzyme “CRADL”;3 and the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase ADH4 were separately expressed in combinations with Raldh2 in JEG-3 cells. Upon addition of 9cROL, the reporter gene activation analysis showed that efficient formation of 9cRA in vivo was achieved in cells expressing RDH5 and CRAD1, whereas CRAD2 and CRADL were less efficient (Fig.1 C). Surprisingly, cells co-expressing ADH4 and Raldh2 displayed a low capacity to generate 9cRA from 9cROL. Addition of 9cRAL efficiently induced reporter gene activation in transfected cells expressing all combinations of enzymes. No obvious differences in the capacity to oxidize 9-cis-retinal were found between Raldh1 and Raldh2 (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts from cells overexpressing ADH4 and CRAD1 verified that these enzymes were produced (Fig. 1 D). In addition, RT-PCR analyses of total RNA fractions from the transfected cells demonstrated that transcripts encoding the enzymes were properly expressed. We conclude from these experiments that the in vivo capacities of the different retinol dehydrogenases to convert 9cROL into 9cRAL differ significantly, with CRAD1 being ∼2 times as efficient in vivo as RDH5 using this cell reporter system. In line with theirin vitro activities, 9-cis-retinol was a poor substrate for CRAD2 (14Su J. Chai X. Kahn B. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17910-17916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and CRADL.3 Previous analysis of RDH5, closely related in primary structures to CRAD1, has suggested a lumenal orientation of the catalytic domain of the enzyme and that it is membrane-anchored by a NH2-terminal signal anchor and a transmembrane segment close to the cytosolic COOH terminus (16Simon A. Romert A. Gustafsson A.-L. McCaffrey J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Romert A. Tuvendal P. Tryggvason K. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To investigate the membrane topology of CRAD1, microsomes from COS-1 cells expressing CRAD1 were isolated and subjected to limited proteolysis using proteinase K. In intact microsomes, CRAD1 was well protected from degradation, whereas in Triton X-100-treated microsomes, CRAD1 was rapidly degraded by the protease (Fig.2 A). These data are consistent with the notion that the membrane topology of CRAD1 is similar to that of RDH5 with a lumenal catalytic domain and the COOH terminus located in the cytosol. A schematic illustration of the membrane topology of CRAD1 is outlined in Fig. 2 B. To analyze structure-activity relationships in CRAD1, we constructed several mutants of the enzyme that could affect the membrane topology and mode of membrane interaction. The mutations were introduced to generate premature stop codons before the transmembrane segment (L289Stop), and before the COOH-terminal cytosolic tail (R312Stop), respectively. In addition, the active site tyrosine in CRAD1 was mutated into a phenylalanine (Y175F) (Fig. 2 B). Expression of the CRAD1 mutants in COS-1 cells and immunoblotting analysis of isolated microsomes from the transfected cells showed that significant expression levels of the mutant protein was found only in the mutant affecting the COOH-terminal tail (R312Stop). Other mutations failed to generate detectable levels of protein, probably due to decreased protein stability and subsequent degradation (Fig.3 A). An identical carboxyl-terminal tail deletion was also introduced in RDH5 (R312Stop) and the expression of wild-type RDH5 and mutant RDH5 R312Stop in transfected COS-1 cells was verified by immunoblotting (Fig.3 B). Activity analysis of the two truncated versions of CRAD1 and RDH5 in the cell reporter assay showed that both mutants displayed low capacities to catalyze the conversion of the substrate in vivo compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3, C andD). Addition of 2 mm NAD to the culture medium did not alleviate the lack of enzymatic activity in vivo(data not shown). Separate analysis showed that the carboxyl-terminal truncated enzymes present in isolated microsomes displayed almost full enzymatic activity in vitro when compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3 (E–G) for CRAD1, and data not shown for RDH5). These results suggested that the COOH-terminal cytosolic tails of the two enzymes are not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism, a result consistent with the membrane topologies of the enzymes. Instead, it may be involved in controlling intracellular compartmentalization of the enzymes, which may indirectly effect the ability of the enzyme to oxidize 9cROL in vivo. To test this hypothesis, wild-type CRAD1, CRAD1 R312Stop mutant, wild-type RDH5, and RDH5 R312Stop mutant were separately expressed in CHO cells, and intracellular localization of the enzymes was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. As a marker of the ER, the cells were also stained with Texas Red-labeled concanavalin A. The results showed that wild-type CRAD1 and RDH5 displayed typical ER staining patterns (Fig. 4,A–C and I–K). In contrast, the CRAD1 R312Stop and RDH5 R312Stop mutants displayed strikingly different staining patterns. The CRAD1 mutant was localized in strongly stained elongated perinuclear fiber-like structures, while the RDH5 mutant was localized in unevenly distributed patchlike structures (Fig. 4, E–Gand L–N). Staining with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin, to visualize the actin filaments, showed no obvious overlapping localization of the actin fibers with the truncated mutant CRAD1 (Fig.4, D and H). Similarly, staining with fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin, to visualize the nuclear envelope and the Golgi apparatus, showed only marginal co-localization of this marker with the mutant enzymes (data not shown). All together, these results suggested that the COOH-terminal tails in CRAD1 and RDH5 have a role in compartmentalization of the enzymes and that ER localization of the enzymes might be necessary for enzymatic activity in vivo. At present, three major classes of enzymes have been implicated in synthesis of RA: the cytosolic medium chain alcohol dehydrogenases and microsomal members of the short chain dehydrogenase superfamily acting as retinol dehydrogenases, and the cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenases acting as retinal dehydrogenases. The proposed roles of these enzymes in retinoid metabolism are mainly based onin vitro enzymatic activities, and in some cases also supported by the expression patterns of the enzymes. Genetic evidences for the involvement of some of these enzymes in retinoid biosynthesis come from the identification of patients carrying mutations in RDH5 which effects the synthesis of 11-cis-retinal in the eye, and from the analysis of a gene-targeted mouse strain lacking expression of Raldh2, which leads to embryonic lethality (19Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 29Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of several enzymes putatively involved in the pathways generating RA, no attempts to reconstitute a metabolic pathway able to generate RA from retinol have been reported. In the present work we demonstrate that efficient formation of 9cRA from 9cROLin vivo requires the concerted action of retinol dehydrogenases and retinal dehydrogenases. This finding implicates that efficient generation of RA in other cell types, i.e. cells in adult and embryonic tissues, may also require both enzymatic activities. We anticipate that modified versions of the coupled enzyme/reporter cell system can be useful in analyzing the structural and functional requirements for efficient synthesis of atRA in transfected reporter cells. The microsomal CRAD1 and RDH5 appeared to be the most efficient enzymes converting 9cROL into 9cRAL of the retinol dehydrogenases tested. The subsequent formation of 9cRA in cells co-expressing retinal dehydrogenases shows that the two enzymatic reactions underlying formation of 9cRA from 9cROL are coupled, despite the different locations of the two reactions (lumenal versus cytosolic). In contrast, the cytosolic ADH4, previously reported to efficiently convert retinol into retinal in vitro, appeared as a less efficient retinol dehydrogenase in the transfected cells. The apparent lack of coupling of the enzymatic activities of ADH4 and the retinal dehydrogenases is surprising considering that both types of enzymes are cytosolic. Explanations to this observation might be that the cytosol is strongly reducing which would not favor retinol oxidation in vivo, or that sufficient concentrations of 9cROL or cofactor are not available to the enzyme. The latter explanation appears, however, less likely since 9cROL is hydrophobic and would easily cross cellular membranes and the cytosolic concentration of NAD is high. The efficiency of some of the microsomal retinol dehydrogenases contrasts the poor ability of ADH4 to oxidize 9cROL. Both CRAD1 and RDH5 display a unique membrane topology with the catalytic domains in lumenal compartments of the cells. The ER lumen is oxidative (30Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), and the milieu would favor retinol oxidation provided that sufficient concentrations of substrate and oxidized cofactors are available. CRAD1 and RDH5 have a preference for NAD as the cofactor (7Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Chai X.Y. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Romert A. Tuvendal P. Simon A. Dencker L. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 4404-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); our results imply that sufficient concentrations of NAD are indeed present in the ER lumen. These conclusions are in line with previous measurements of cofactor concentrations in isolated microsomes (31Bublitz C. Lawler C.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The origin of the lumenal NAD is currently unknown, but it may be generated inside the ER lumen by yet uncharacterized mechanisms, or it may be accumulated from the cytosol. In the latter case, we would predict the existence of a specific transport mechanism for the hydrophilic pyridine nucleotides, possibly involving a specific transmembrane transporter system. The low in vivo activity and subcellular mislocalization of the mutants of CRAD1 and RDH5, lacking the extreme COOH-terminal regions of 6 or 7 amino acids, respectively, implies that correct subcellular compartmentalization may be important for the activities of these enzymes. Under the experimental conditions used by us, the substrate 9cROL is unlikely to be the rate-limiting factor. Instead, the mislocalized mutant enzymes may end up in a subcellular compartment with a general milieu that does not favor retinol oxidation, or in a compartment with insufficient concentrations of NAD, or that formed 9cRAL generated by the mutant enzyme is unable to cross the ER membrane to reach the cytosolic Raldh2 for further oxidation to 9cRA. At present, it is not possible to distinguish between these possibilities. The COOH-terminal cytosolic regions of the microsomal RDHs, including CRAD1 and RDH5, are well conserved (Fig.5). In fact, the extreme COOH-terminal amino acids are -A-L in all members of the enzyme family, except in RDH5, which has an extension of one additional amino acid and ends with a hydroxyl-containing amino acid (Y in bovine and human RDH5, and S in mouse RDH5). Furthermore, the COOH-terminal tails of all the enzymes have a conserved pattern of several other residues, including the invariant proline residues at position -5 (-6 in RDH5). The conserved features of the cytosolic tails in the RDHs, and the fact that deletion of the cytosolic tails in CRAD1 and RDH5 leads to mislocalization of the enzymes and loss of enzymatic activities in vivo, argue for a role of the cytosolic tails in interactions with cellular components involved in retaining, or retrieving of the enzymes in the ER. Interestingly, several fundus albipunctatus patients recently identified in Japan have mutations in, or close to, the COOH-terminal cytosolic tail of RDH5 (A294P (Ref. 20Gonzalez-Fernandez F. Kurz D. Bao Y. Newman S. Conway B.P. Young J.E. Han D.P. Khani S.C. Mol. Vis. 1999; 5: 41-47PubMed Google Scholar) and delC1085/ins GAAG (Ref.32Wada Y. Abe T. Fuse N. Tamai M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2000; 41: 1894-1897PubMed Google Scholar)), suggesting that an intact COOH-terminal tail might be necessary for proper function of the enzyme in vivo. The identification of putative proteins interacting with the COOH-terminal tails of the RDHs might provide further clues to the roles of these enzymes in retinoid homeostasis in adult and embryonic tissues.

https://openalex.org/W1994309851,"The inability of psychrophilic microorganisms to grow at moderate temperatures (>20 °C) presently represents an unresolved thermodynamic paradox. Here we report for the psychrophilic yeast Rhodotorula aurantiaca A19, isolated from Antarctic ice, that the inability to grow at temperatures close to 20 °C is associated with profound alterations in cell morphology and integrity. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the intracellular acyl-CoA esters revealed an abnormal accumulation of myristoyl-CoA (C14-CoA) in cells cultivated close to the nonpermissive temperature. Its concentration (500 μm) was found to be 28-fold higher than in cells cultivated at 0 °C. If one considers its ability to disrupt membrane bilayers and to inhibit many cellular enzymes and functions, intracellular myristoyl-CoA accumulation in the psychrophileR. aurantiaca represents one of the principal causes of growth arrest at moderate temperatures. Intracellular acyl-CoA concentrations are believed to be regulated by thioesterase activity. Thus in an attempt to explore the mechanism by which temperature disrupts myristoyl-CoA metabolism, we isolated and characterized a long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase.

The key of psychrophily in cold-adapted microorganisms, or psychrophiles, is their ability to produce cold-adapted enzymes (1Feller G. Lonhienne T. Deroanne C. Libioulle C. Van Beeumen J. Gerday C.

However, the incapacity to grow at moderate temperatures (>20 °C) remains a paradox and represents a barrier to their use in ecological and biotechnological processes. Earlier studies, reviewed by Inniss (10Inniss W.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol... 1975; 29: 445-465Google Scholar), report that the biochemical basis for the maximum growth temperature of psychrophiles is likely to be complex, involving a number of interacting phenomena. Temperature changes cause alterations in the structural and molecular components of cells, for example membrane integrity and permeability, functional stability of ribosomes, and enzyme activity and stability. Recently, a large body of evidence has been accumulated indicating that long chain acyl-CoA esters have an important function in the regulation of a large number of cellular systems and functions, including ion channels, ion pumps, translocators, enzymes, membrane fusion, and gene regulation (for review see Ref. 11Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J... 1997; 323: 1-12Google Scholar). Because of the amphipathic nature of acyl-CoA esters, excessive increases in their concentration can cause important cellular damage, including membrane disruption and a nonspecific inhibition of a variety of enzymes (11Faergeman N.J.

A number of recognized metabolic diseases including Reye's syndrome and sudden infant death syndrome can be attributed to specific enzyme deficiencies in acyl-CoA catabolic pathways, which result in the accumulation of toxic acyl-CoA thioesters (15Roe C.R. Millington D.S. Maltby D.A. Kinnebrew P. J. Pediatr... 1986; 108: 13-18Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of free acyl-CoA esters is tightly controlled by feedback inhibition of the acyl-CoA synthetase and is buffered and transported by the specific acyl-CoA-binding proteins (11Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J... 1997; 323: 1-12Google Scholar,16Knudsen J. Jensen M.V. Hansen J.K. Faergeman N.J. Neergaard T.B. Gaigg B. Mol. Cell. Biochem... 1999; 192: 95-103Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions the total acyl-CoA ester content in cells is in the range 5–160 μm, with the free cytosolic concentration in the low nanomolar range being unlikely to exceed 200 nm (11Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J... 1997; 323: 1-12Google Scholar). Abnormal increases in the concentration are expected to be prevented by conversion into acylcarnitines or by hydrolysis by acyl-CoA hydrolases (17Berge R.K. Aarsland A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1985; 837: 141-151Google Scholar). At present, for psychrophilic microorganisms, no data are available on the effects of growth temperature on the cellular metabolism of acyl-CoA esters. In this paper we report that moderate temperatures, above 20 °C, cause an abnormal accumulation of myristoyl-CoA (tetradecanoyl-CoA) in the psychrophilic yeast Rhodotorula aurantiaca. The excessive concentration at moderate temperatures is probably one of the principal causes of cell death. Acyl-CoA thioesterases are enzymes that cleave thioester bonds of fatty acyl-CoA and liberate free fatty acids and CoASH. Thioesterase activity is widely distributed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (18Waku K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1992; 1124: 101-111Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, acyl-CoA thioesterase activity is detected in various subcellular organelles (19Berge R.K. Farstad M. Eur. J. Biochem... 1979; 96: 393-401Google Scholar, 20Berge R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1979; 574: 321-333Google Scholar) including lysosomes (21Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 15831-15836Google Scholar), peroxisomes, and mitochondria (22Svensson L.T. Engberg S.T. Aoyama T. Usuda N. Alexson S.E. Hashimoto T. Biochem. J... 1998; 329: 601-608Google Scholar) as well as in the cytosol (23Srere P.A. Seubert W. Lynen F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1959; 33: 313-319Google Scholar). Although all the physiological functions of acyl-CoA thioesterases have not yet been clearly understood, previous data suggest (11Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J... 1997; 323: 1-12Google Scholar, 17Berge R.K. Aarsland A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1985; 837: 141-151Google Scholar, 22Svensson L.T. Engberg S.T. Aoyama T. Usuda N. Alexson S.E. Hashimoto T. Biochem. J... 1998; 329: 601-608Google Scholar) that they are involved in lipid metabolism and modulation of cellular concentrations of acyl-CoA derivatives. To assess further the mechanism by which temperature disrupts the regulation of myristoyl-CoA metabolism, we isolated and characterized aR. aurantiaca thioesterase with a particular focus on its thermodynamic properties. R. aurantiacaA19 was isolated at the Laboratory of Biochemistry, University of Liege, Belgium, from ice near the French Antarctic Station at Dumont d'Urville (66° 40′S, 140° 01′E) and identified by the Mycotheque of the University of Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; the registration number is 40267. The growth medium, YPD, contains 2% dextrose, 2% casein peptone, and 1% yeast extract. For thioesterase purification R. aurantiaca A19 was produced in a 400-liter bioreactor (Biolaffite, France). Culturing was carried out aerobically (0.5 volume of air per volume of culture per minute) at 12 °C, in the YPD medium. After 100 h of growth 3.5 kg of cells were recovered by centrifugation (Sharples centrifuge, Alpha-Laval, Sweden). Culturing was carried out at 0 or 18 °C until cell concentration in cultures reached 107cells/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and acyl-CoA esters were extracted using a method adapted from a previously published extraction process (24Prasad M.R. Sauter J. Lands W.E. Anal. Biochem... 1987; 162: 202-212Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with 100 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 4% (v/v) glacial acetic acid. 3 ml of the same buffer and 40 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2) were then added to 3 g of the cells, and the mixture was homogenized using a blender (Ultra-Turrax T25, Van der Heyden) for 3 min at 8000 rpm. Extraction was completed by adding 12.7 ml of distilled water and 12.7 ml of chloroform. After centrifugation the chloroform phase containing lipids was carefully removed, and the aqueous phase containing acyl-CoA esters and proteins was washed three times with 20 ml of chloroform. Proteins were precipitated by addition of 25 ml of acetonitrile. The mixture was allowed to stand for 20 min at room temperature before centrifugation. The supernatant was lyophilized before chromatography analysis. The extracted acyl-CoA esters were analyzed by HPLC on a LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (Merck). The mobile phases used were solvent A (20% acetonitrile in 25 mm KH2PO4, pH 5.3) and solvent B (80% acetonitrile in 25 mmKH2PO4, pH 5.3). The acyl-CoA esters were eluted with the following gradient of solvent B in solvent A: 0% B for 10 min, 0–60% B for 55 min, 60% B for 10 min, 60–100% B for 10 min, 100% B for 10 min, and 100 to 0% B for 5 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Acyl-CoA esters were detected by UV absorption at 254 nm. Peaks were identified using standards (Sigma). For quantification of acyl-CoA esters the recorded chromatograms were integrated, and the amounts of individual acyl-CoA esters were determined by comparing peak areas to those obtained by injection of known quantities of commercial myristoyl-CoA. Data acquisition and integration were performed using the Softron PC Integration Software. The peak eluted at the expected myristoyl-CoA elution time (39.7 min) was analyzed and identified by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry using a method previously described by Norwood et al.(25Norwood D.L. Bus C.A. Millington D.S. J. Chromatogr... 1990; 527: 289-301Google Scholar). 400 g of cells were suspended in 1 liter of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 3 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm EDTA and disrupted by pressure at 1500 bar with a Niro homogenizer (Panda). The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 40,000 ×g for 60 min. Nucleic acids were removed by addition of protamine sulfate (0.1% w/v) and centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Ammonium sulfate salt was added to the cell extract under constant stirring until 30% saturation was obtained. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 10,000 × g). The resulting supernatant was saturated to 80% by addition of (NH4)2SO4. The resulting precipitate was solubilized in 200 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. Samples were applied to a phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow XK26/40 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mNaCl. A flow rate of 3 ml/min was used. The unadsorbed material was washed successively with 1 liter of the equilibration buffer and with 600 ml of distilled water. Desorption of the bound proteins was performed with 200 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.5. Active fractions from the phenyl-Sepharose column were pooled, dialyzed overnight with distilled water, and lyophilized. The dried sample was solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, and applied to a Mono Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, as follows: 0m NaCl for 20 min, 0–0.15 m NaCl for 20 min, 0.15 m NaCl for 30 min, 0.15–1 m NaCl for 5 min, and 1 m NaCl for 10 min. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, and fractions of 2 ml were collected. Active fractions eluted from the Mono Q column were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration on a Amicon YM 10 membrane, and mixed with a 4 m(NH4)2SO4 solution to give a final (NH4)2SO4 concentration of 1m. The sample was then applied to a phenyl-Superose column HR5/5 previously equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 1 m(NH4)2SO4. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, as follows: 1 m(NH4)2SO4 for 20 min, 1 to 0.6m (NH4)2SO4 for 20 min, 0.6 m (NH4)2SO4 for 30 min, 0.6–0 m (NH4)2SO4for 5 min, and 0 m(NH4)2SO4 for 10 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of 2 ml were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem... 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using Coomassie Blue G. Analysis of column fractions during purification was performed by gel electrophoresis using the LKB Multifor II electrophoresis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polyacrylamide gels (ExcelGel SDS 8–18, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for SDS-PAGE following the standard procedure of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). 15–40 μg of protein per sample were deposited on the gel. Proteins were revealed by silver nitrate staining. Thioesterase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 212 nm resulting from the generation of free CoASH in the presence of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma). Activities were determined with an ε412 nm of 13.6 mm−1 cm−1for the 2-nitrobenzoate anion. A typical reaction mixture contained 100 μm myristoyl-CoA substrate in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. A unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 μmol of myristoyl-CoA per min. The molecular mass of the native protein was determined by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An aliquot of the purified enzyme from the phenyl-Superose chromatography step was applied to the column. Running buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, and 150 mm NaCl. The flow rate was fixed at 0.3 ml/min, and fractions of 3 ml were collected. The molecular mass of the thioesterase was also estimated by SDS-PAGE under the conditions described above. Kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs were determined at concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, as described for the thioesterase assay. The thermodependence of the kinetic parameters was determined in the temperature range from 5 to 35 °C. The substrate used was myristoyl-CoA at concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2. The study was carried out using a computer controlled LKB Ultrospec III spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated cell changer base plate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To calculateKm and Vmax values experimental data points were computer-fitted (Enzyme Kinetic Application Software 2.01, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to the Hanes transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation. The optimum temperature for activity was determined over the range 5–60 °C with the thermostated LKB Ultrospec III spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For thermostability, aliquots of purified thioesterase (28 μg per ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0) were incubated at 40, 50, and 60 °C, and samples were periodically withdrawn and chilled on ice before being assayed at 25 °C by the standard method. The Antarctic yeast R. aurantiaca A19 is unable to grow above 20 °C and is therefore referred as a psychrophilic strain (28Morita R.Y. Bacteriol. Rev... 1975; 39: 144-167Google Scholar). Cultures are highly temperature-sensitive, and cell density drastically decreases when temperature increases (29Sabri A. Jacques P. Weekers F. Baré G. Hiligsmann S. Moussaif M. Thonart P. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol... 2000; 84–86: 391-399Google Scholar). Moreover, temperatures higher than those normally experienced by the strain (−2 to 4 °C) have pronounced effects on physiological processes and cell morphology. Examination by phase contrast microscopy shows major cell morphological changes when the cultures are grown near 20 °C (Fig. 1). Budding is inhibited, and cells are larger than at low temperatures. Membrane integrity could also be affected since cellular content release was observed (arrows in Fig. 1 B). A similar behavior is reported for several temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mutants are affected in long chain acyl-CoA metabolism and showed a temperature-dependent auxotrophy for long chain saturated fatty acids (30Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Johnson R.L. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol... 1991; 113: 1313-1330Google Scholar, 31Duronio R.J. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol... 1992; 117: 515-529Google Scholar, 32Knoll L.J. Levy M.A. Stahl P.D. Gordon J.I.

Genet... 1971; 113: 1-19Google Scholar, 35Kuhn L. Castorph H. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem... 1972; 24: 492-497Google Scholar). A thermal shift from 24 to above 30 °C causes growth arrest associated with an increase in cell size and membrane lysis (33Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Rowley N. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 18037-18046Google Scholar). With R. aurantiaca A19, exogenous fatty acids (C12, C14, C16, and C18) do not improve cell growth at nonpermissive temperatures (Fig. 2). To determine whether acyl-CoA metabolism is affected by growth temperature, intracellular acyl-CoA esters were extracted and analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 3). The extract of cells grown at 18 °C showed an important peak at a retention time of 39.7 min. The peak was identified as myristoyl-CoA (C14-CoA) by comparison with an authentic standard. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry confirmed the identification. The mass spectrum and suggested fragmentation pattern are shown in Fig.4. The peak at m/z 978 corresponds to the protonated molecular ion (MH+). Cleavages producing ions at m/z 471, 508, 428, and 330 are significance. The ion at m/z 471 is of particular significant because it preserves the identity of the acyl group (25Norwood D.L. Bus C.A. Millington D.S. J. Chromatogr... 1990; 527: 289-301Google Scholar). Cleavage at the adenine-ribose bond produces a positive ion atm/z 136.Figure 4Full mass spectrum and suggested fragmentation pattern for myristoyl-CoA eluted at 39.7 min on reverse-phase chromatography (Fig. 3) and analyzed by positive ion fast atom bombardment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The intracellular concentration of myristoyl-CoA in cells cultivated at 18 °C is 500 μm and is 28-fold higher than in cells grown at 0 °C. Retention times for octanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and stearoyl-CoA are 16.2, 25.1, 45.2, and 52.1 min, respectively, and no significant difference is observed in their intracellular concentrations at 0 and 18 °C. Several mechanisms have been suggested for the regulation of cellular acyl-CoA ester concentration. Berge and Aarsland (17Berge R.K. Aarsland A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1985; 837: 141-151Google Scholar) proposed that acyl-CoA pools are regulated by acyl-CoA thioesterase, thus we purified and characterized the R. aurantiaca A19 thioesterase. Despite the negative effect of the increasing temperature on cell growth, thioesterase production is not directly influenced by temperature, and it decreases proportionally with cell density (data not shown). At all experimental temperatures production was 1 unit/109 cells. Following cultivation of R. aurantiaca A19 at 12 °C, the intracellular long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase was released by mechanic cell disruption and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and three successive fast protein liquid chromatography steps. Recoveries calculated after each purification step are given in TableI. A final yield of 32% was obtained, and the purified enzyme had a specific activity of 108 units/mg of protein. Specific activity is 351 times higher after purification than in the crude extract.Table IPurification of thioesterase from the psychrophilic yeast R. aurantiaca A19Total proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldCrude extract11,0803,4000.31001Ammonium sulfate2,6801,9000.7562.3Phenyl-Sepharose1691,83710.85435.4Mono Q21.61,81183.853273Phenyl-Superose101,08010832351Activity was determined with myristoyl-CoA as the substrate. Open table in a new tab Activity was determined with myristoyl-CoA as the substrate. SDS-PAGE analysis shows that the enzyme is pure at homogeneity, with an apparent molecular mass of about 80 kDa (Fig.5). Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 shows an apparent molecular mass of 85 ± 6 kDa indicating that the purified thioesterase is monomeric. The pI of the enzyme is 4.4, and the enzyme is stable and active over a broad pH range (5Hochachka P.W. Somero G.N.

Enzyme activity is completely inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphates, indicating that the thioesterase has a serine residue in its active site. The thioesterase is a highly glycosylated protein, and the glycosidic portion, removed by endoglycosidase H, represents about 19% of its molecular weight. The intact enzyme has an N terminus blocked to protein sequencing. However, analysis of two internal peptide sequences obtained by endoproteinase Lys-C digestion (LREIALMRY and QAAYDTTAEFA) exhibited, respectively, 77 and 72% identity with two amino acid sequences located between residues 179–187 and 252–262 of the S. cerevisiae Mvp1 protein (36Ekena K. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1995; 15: 1671-1678Google Scholar). This protein interacts, by unknown mechanism, with Vps1p; a protein essential for vacuolar protein sorting and cell growth at high temperature (36Ekena K. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1995; 15: 1671-1678Google Scholar, 37Rothman J.H. Raymond C.K. Gilbert T. O'Hara P.J. Stevens T.H. Cell.. 1990; 61: 1063-1074Google Scholar). Substrate specificity was determined using several acyl-CoA ester derivatives. Kinetic parameters for hydrolysis are given in TableII. Thioesterase is active on thioesters with carbon chain lengths ranging from 8 to 18. No activity is detected with C2-CoA or C4-CoA. The preferred substrates are C14-CoA, C16-CoA, and C18-CoA, and their Km values range from 18 to 24 μm. The best substrate is myristoyl-CoA which is hydrolyzed with the higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of about 10 s−1·μm−1. The Km andkcat/Km values calculated for the hydrolysis of the unsaturated palmitoleoyl-CoA (C16:1) are 2-fold higher and 3.5-fold lower, respectively, than those calculated for the corresponding saturated thioester (C16:0).Table IIKinetic parameters for thioesterase hydrolysis of different acyl-CoA esters at 25 °CKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1s−1μm−1Octanoyl-CoA (C8:0)118 ± 15159 ± 251Decanoyl-CoA (C10:0)67 ± 12136 ± 232Myristoyl-CoA (C14:0)18 ± 2183 ± 1610Palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0)23 ± 4153 ± 127Palmitoleoyl-CoA (C16:1)58 ± 14106 ± 122Stearoyl-CoA (C18:0)24 ± 4121 ± 145 Open table in a new tab Thermal stability of the thioesterase activity was examined by heating the enzyme solution to 40, 50, and 60 °C for different times (Fig.6 A). The remaining activities after 60 min of incubation are 82, 52, and 3%, respectively. The temperature profile of thioesterase activity was determined at temperatures ranging from 5 to 60 °C (Fig. 6 B) and shows an optimal activity at 45 °C. Thermodependence of the kinetic parameters Km and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for myristoyl-CoA hydrolysis shows that the best physiological efficiency of the thioesterase is reached near 0 °C (Fig.7). The Km value is 0.4 μm at 5 °C and increases exponentially with temperature; at 20 °C it is 59-fold higher. Catalytic efficiency is also largely affected by a temperature increase; its value is 28-fold higher at 5 than at 20 °C (Fig. 7). The inability to grow above 20 °C is common in psychrophilic microorganisms (10Inniss W.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol... 1975; 29: 445-465Google Scholar, 28Morita R.Y. Bacteriol. Rev... 1975; 39: 144-167Google Scholar, 38Russell N.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Boil Sci... 1990; 326: 595-611Google Scholar) and seems to be thermodynamically a paradox, especially if one considers the favorable effect of moderate temperatures on enzyme reactions and biological processes. Temperatures higher than 5 °C have a negative effect on the growth of the antarctic yeast R. aurantiaca A19, and cell lysis occurs when cultures are grown close to the upper temperature limit for growth. Because of their amphipathic and toxic property, an excess of acyl-CoA esters is likely to disrupt membrane bilayers and to impair several cellular enzymes and functions (11Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J... 1997; 323: 1-12Google Scholar, 16Knudsen J. Jensen M.V. Hansen J.K. Faergeman N.J. Neergaard T.B. Gaigg B. Mol. Cell. Biochem... 1999; 192: 95-103Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of the intracellular acyl-CoA esters from R. aurantiaca A19 reveals an abnormal accumulation of myristoyl-CoA (C14-CoA) in cells cultivated close to the nonpermissive temperature (20 °C). Its concentration is 500 μm (28-fold higher than at 0 °C), whereas it has been reported that the total cellular acyl-CoA ester content is unlikely to exceed 160 μm, even under the most extreme conditions (11Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J... 1997; 323: 1-12Google Scholar). Myristoyl-CoA is an essential compound for cell growth because it contributes to the activation, by N-myristoylation, of several proteins regulating cell growth and signal transduction (31Duronio R.J. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol... 1992; 117: 515-529Google Scholar,33Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Rowley N. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 18037-18046Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae there are at least two metabolic pathways that produce myristoyl-CoA, de novo synthesis or activation of free myristate by acyl-CoA synthetases (30Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Johnson R.L. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol... 1991; 113: 1313-1330Google Scholar, 31Duronio R.J. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol... 1992; 117: 515-529Google Scholar, 32Knoll L.J.

The de novo pathway uses malonyl-CoA produced by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (39Mishina M. Roggenkamp R. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem... 1980; 111: 79-87Google Scholar) to generate long chain saturated acyl-CoAs through the cytosolic fatty-acid synthetase complex (40Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1992; II: 415-500Google Scholar). Palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA are the main products of fatty-acid synthetase, whereas myristoyl-CoA represents only 3–5% of the total acyl-CoAs synthesized (41Hori T. Nakamura N. Okuyama H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ).. 1987; 101: 949-956Google Scholar,42Singh N. Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Biochemistry.. 1985; 24: 6598-6602Google Scholar). In R. aurantiaca A19 myristoyl-CoA accumulation at nonpermissive temperatures could not be due to an increase in the fatty-acid synthetase activity or acyl-CoA synthetase as it represents a minor product of these enzymes in comparison with palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA (41Hori T. Nakamura N. Okuyama H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ).. 1987; 101: 949-956Google Scholar, 42Singh N. Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Biochemistry.. 1985; 24: 6598-6602Google Scholar, 43Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem... 1980; 112: 431-442Google Scholar). Intracellular concentrations of acyl-CoA esters are regulated by their rate of synthesis, utilization, and degradation, and excessive increases in their concentration are prevented by hydrolysis by thioesterases (11Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J... 1997; 323: 1-12Google Scholar, 16Knudsen J. Jensen M.V. Hansen J.K. Faergeman N.J. Neergaard T.B. Gaigg B. Mol. Cell. Biochem... 1999; 192: 95-103Google Scholar, 17Berge R.K.

At present, myristoyl-CoA metabolism is not completely understood; however, the increase in concentration at 18 °C indicates a deficiency in its utilization and/or hydrolysis at high temperatures. Because of their putative contribution to the control of myristoyl-CoA levels, an 80-kDa long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase was isolated and characterized. The intracellular accumulation of myristoyl-CoA could not be related to a thermal inhibition of the genetic expression of the purified thioesterase because its production is about 1 unit/109 cells and varies proportionally with cell density at various culture temperatures. On the other hand, great structural flexibility is a rather common characteristic of the psychrophilic enzymes (1Feller G. Lonhienne T. Deroanne C. Libioulle C. Van Beeumen J. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 5217-5221Google Scholar, 2Feller G. Gerday C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci... 1997; 53: 830-841Google Scholar, 3Davail S. Feller G. Narinx E. Gerday C. J. Biol.

Biochemical Adaptation.Princeton University Press. 1984; : 355-449Google Scholar). Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the lower thermal stability of R. aurantiaca thioesterase could be a cause of the intracellular accumulation of myristoyl-CoA at nonpermissive temperatures. However, the thermostability of R. aurantiaca thioesterase contrasts with this suggestion. Enzyme-substrate interactions may also exhibit marked temperature dependence. The affinity and the catalytic efficiency generally give much information on this, especially in the case of regulatory intracellular enzymes that catalyze reactions at substrate concentration close to the Km value (2Feller G.

The temperature at which the affinity and the catalytic efficiency toward the myristoyl-CoA are highest closely coincides with the habitat temperature of the strain. At nonpermissive temperatures both parameters dramatically decrease, and the loss of catalytic efficiency correlates with the intracellular increase in myristoyl-CoA concentration. This behavior is consistent with the physiological temperature of the source organism; however, among the cold-adapted enzymes studied so far, this is the first intracellular enzyme found to display such a large variation in the Km and catalytic efficiency with temperature. If one admits that thekcat/Km ratio is the operational parameter for regulatory intracellular enzymes, this finding is very important and reveals one of the probable mechanisms for the intracellular accumulation of myristoyl-CoA and cell death at moderate temperatures. On the other hand, thioesterase is described as a “scavenger” in acyl-CoA metabolism, and its regulation role should only be utilized to avoid excessive concentrations (11Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J... 1997; 323: 1-12Google Scholar, 16Knudsen J. Jensen M.V. Hansen J.K. Faergeman N.J. Neergaard T.B. Gaigg B. Mol. Cell. Biochem... 1999; 192: 95-103Google Scholar). Consequently, the pathological accumulation of myristoyl-CoA at high temperatures would not only be caused by the decrease in its hydrolysis by thioesterase but also by other, as yet unknown, factors. One such factor could be a deficiency in N-myristoyltransferase activity, which is an essential enzyme for cell growth and represents an important myristoyl-CoA utilizer. Recent work indicates that in mesophilic yeasts severalN-myristoyltransferase mutations can cause a temperature-dependent affinity decrease for myristoyl-CoA and growth arrest above 30 °C (30Duronio R.J.

Moreover, a high myristoyl-CoA concentration without increase of the concentration of other long chain acyl-CoA esters, particularly palmitoyl-CoA, well known as the major product of the fatty acid synthase (41Hori T. Nakamura N. Okuyama H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ).. 1987; 101: 949-956Google Scholar, 42Singh N. Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Biochemistry.. 1985; 24: 6598-6602Google Scholar, 43Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem... 1980; 112: 431-442Google Scholar), suggests that the principal pathway of C14-CoA use in the psychrophilicR. aurantiaca is presumably temperature-sensitive and could be different from the metabolic pathways using other long chain acyl-CoA esters. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that moderate temperatures cause a deficiency in the myristoyl-CoA metabolism in the psychrophile R. aurantiaca. Growth arrest at high temperatures is associated with a toxic intracellular accumulation of myristoyl-CoA. The purified long chain acyl-CoA thioesterase shows a temperature-dependent decrease in its catalytic efficiency and in its affinity for myristoyl-CoA. This result reveals one of the probable mechanisms by which high temperatures induce growth arrest. Finally, our work should stimulate further studies of other enzymes that are implied in myristoyl-CoA metabolism and contribute to the understanding of the biochemical basis of the inability of psychrophilic microorganisms to grow at moderate temperatures.

https://openalex.org/W2140305836,"The cell cycle regulator, retinoblastoma protein, is known to potentiate glucocorticoid receptor-activated transcription through the interaction of its pocket domain with the transcription coactivator, hBRM. We now show that glucocorticoid receptor-induced apoptosis is also dependent on both the retinoblastoma protein and hBRM. p107 and p130, which share extensive sequence homology with the pocket domain of the retinoblastoma protein but not its N-terminal region, also interact with hBRM but do not support either glucocorticoid receptor-dependent activity. This difference arises from the divergent N-terminal domain of the retinoblastoma protein, which, when fused to the pocket domains, confers upon p107 and p130 the ability to influence glucocorticoid receptor activities. This effect probably results from the promotion of glucocorticoid receptor-targeted chromatin remodeling by the hBRM-containing SWI/SNF complex because the N-terminal domain of the retinoblastoma protein enhances glucocorticoid receptor-hBRM interactions. These results highlight that, besides the interaction between hBRM and the pocket domain of RB, the N-terminal region of the retinoblastoma protein is also essential for glucocorticoid receptor-induced apoptosis and the potentiation of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription and provide a basis for functional distinction between the retinoblastoma protein and its homologues."

Zusman S.B. White K. Dev. Genet. 1983; 3: 347-363Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Viable alleles of erect wing give rise to flies with defects in indirect flight muscle development, leading to the erect wing phenotype. Immunostaining has shown that EWG is a nuclear protein expressed in neurons during the embryonic and larval stages (2DeSimone S. White K. Mol. Cell.

Roy S. Raghavan K.V. White K. Development. 1996; 122: 31-39PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of EWG is regulated posttranscriptionally; the regulated efficiency of the splicing of the ewgtranscript leads to an enrichment of the mRNA encoding the 116-kDa, 733-amino acid-long form of the EWG protein in the nervous system (4Koushika S.P. Soller M. DeSimone S.M. Daub D.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The expression of a cDNA encoding the 116-kDa form of EWG in neurons rescues the lethality caused by loss-of-function mutations in ewg, and broad expression of this cDNA also restores muscle development, indicating that the 116-kDa form of the protein can provide all known ewg activities (2DeSimone S.

Although these proteins share regions of significant homology, diverse activities have been reported for EWG homologs in different species. Similar to ewg, zebrafishnrf is an essential gene expressed in the developing nervous system (5Becker T.S. Burgess S.M. Amsterdam A.H. Allende M.L. Hopkins N.

NRF-1, IBR/F, and P3A2 were identified as sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, although the DNA binding domain in these proteins does not appear to correspond to a known structural motif (6Calzone F.J.

In sea urchins, P3A2 contributes to early pattern formation in the embryo by repressing expression of the CyIIIA cytoskeletal actin gene in oral ectoderm (6Calzone F.J. Hoog C. Teplow D.B.

In contrast to IBR/F, which has been found to repress transcription of the histoneh5 gene by binding to a site overlapping the start site of transcription (9Gomez-Cuadrado A. Martin M. Noel M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6670-6685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gomez-Cuadrado A. Rousseau S. Renaud J. Ruiz-Carrillo A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1857-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), P3A2 acts at a distance to repress transcription. The high degree of sequence similarity between EWG, NRF-1, and P3A2 raises the possibility that EWG may also function to regulate transcription either as an activator or a repressor.In this study we show that EWG functions as a transcriptional activator and that evolutionarily conserved regions of EWG contribute both positively and negatively to transcriptional regulation. In gel mobility shift assays, an EWG dimer binds specifically to a consensus NRF-1 binding site. In Drosophila tissue culture cells, EWG activates transcription from a promoter bearing binding sites for EWG. Deletion analysis of EWG reveals a C-terminal activation domain and an N-terminal domain that inhibits transactivation. The core of the activation domain is highly conserved, and the mutation of evolutionarily conserved residues in the activation domain reduces activity. Our studies suggest that EWG participates in neurogenesis and indirect flight muscle development by directly binding to and regulating the expression of target genes important for differentiation or maintenance of these tissues. The finding that evolutionarily conserved regions of EWG contribute to transcriptional regulation suggests that EWG and its homologs in other species have maintained common mechanisms of action and regulation across evolution.DISCUSSIONWe report here that evolutionarily conserved regions of theDrosophila erect wing gene product, EWG, function to regulate transcription. Using in vitro DNA binding assays and transfection assays in Drosophila tissue culture cells, we have shown that EWG is a sequence-specific, DNA-binding protein that activates transcription from its cognate binding sites. Our analysis of EWG deletion derivatives has revealed functional roles in transcriptional regulation for each of the regions of EWG that are conserved in the human NRF-1 and sea urchin P3A2 homologs with the exception of residues 543–564. In contrast, our studies failed to reveal a critical role for the nonconserved regions of EWG. Because of this strong correlation of sequence conservation with function, it seems likely that conserved residues 543–564 contribute to EWG activity in certain physiological contexts not reproduced in our assays. Consistent with the proposal that the highly conserved region of EWG from residues 146–343 participates in nuclear localization, DNA binding, and dimerization, we have found that deletion of the sequences C-terminal to amino acid 350 does not impair DNA binding or dimerization, and deletion of the sequences N-terminal to position 144 does not reduce, but rather stimulates, site-specific activation. We have mapped the minimal activation domain to residues 564–654, which includes a highly conserved core, residues 631–654, necessary for activation. Unexpectedly, a conserved region in the N terminus was found to inhibit activation by EWG. The identification of evolutionarily conserved regions that both positively and negatively influence transcriptional activation by EWG raises the possibility that the activity of EWG and its homologs may be regulated by common mechanisms dependent upon cell type or promoter context.A wide variety of unrelated amino acid sequences has been shown to function as activation domains (22Triezenberg S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar); thus it is particularly striking that the EWG activation domain is so highly conserved. An analysis of NRF-1 deletions has revealed a major role for NRF-1 residues 449–477 in activation that corresponds well to the highly conserved core that we have shown to be critical for the function of the EWG activation domain (18Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of NRF-1, the mutation of hydrophobic residues in the activation domain also significantly reduced activation, although mutation of multiple glutamines in the activation domain had no effect (18Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NRF-1 has been shown to bind the coactivator PGC-1 through its DNA binding domain, but no targets of the NRF-1 activation domain have been identified (23Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). The high sequence conservation of the activation domain across evolution strongly suggests that EWG and NRF-1 activate transcription by a common mechanism. As shown in Fig. 5, the core activation domain is well conserved in the sea urchin P3A2 homolog, which has been shown to repress transcription (13Kirchhamer C.V. Davidson E.H. Development. 1996; 122: 333-348PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bogarad L.D. Arnone M.I. Chang C. Davidson E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14827-14832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in P3A2 there is alanine at the position equivalent to Val-641 in EWG because we have found that a double mutant in which alanine replaced both Val-639 and Val-641 was severely impaired for activation. Thus, it is possible that P3A2 does not activate transcription because of changes in the region homologous to the activation domain or, alternatively, that this function may be conserved and P3A2 may function both as an activator and as a repressor.Analysis of EWG deletion derivatives revealed the presence of a novel conserved inhibitory domain in the amino terminus. Deletion of residues 87–144 resulted in a 55-fold increase in activation (Fig.6 B). Modulation of transcriptional activation by EWG may be critical because overexpression of EWG in Drosophila, particularly outside the nervous system, is lethal (4Koushika S.P. Soller M. DeSimone S.M. Daub D.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previous studies with NRF-1 found that deletion of the N terminus (Δ77) resulted in decreased DNA binding, which in the case of NRF-1 was shown to be due to a defect in dimerization (21Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was therefore surprising that deletion of the N terminus of EWG resulted in increased activation, particularly because deletion of EWG residues 1–144 was also found to reduce DNA binding activity in vitro. 2 Our results suggest that the N terminus of NRF-1 may also function to inhibit activation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the N terminus of NRF-1 in response to extracellular signals has been shown to increase transcriptional activation by NRF-1 because of an increase in DNA binding (although not dimerization) (12Herzig R.P. Scacco S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13134-13141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,21Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The N terminus of NRF-1 has also been reported to interact with dynein light chains, although the functional significance of this is unknown (20Herzig R.P. Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4263-4273PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved inhibitory region is rich in acidic residues, but the sequence provides no clues as to whether inhibition involves interactions in cis with other regions of EWG or intrans with corepressor proteins. If the latter mechanism applies, it is possible that this amino-terminal domain contributes to transcriptional repression by P3A2. It will be interesting to determine whether the inhibitory activity of the EWG N terminus is modulated in response to extracellular signaling pathways or through interactions with other transcription factors at specific promoters.Expression of the 116-kDa form of EWG is enriched in theDrosophila nervous system because of differential efficiency of splicing (4Koushika S.P. Soller M. DeSimone S.M. Daub D.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several other splice variants of ewgmRNA have been described with the potential of encoding additional EWG isoforms. Our identification of functional domains in EWG supports predictions of the functions of other forms of EWG protein that may be expressed. All of the observed splice variants encode the N terminus, DNA binding, and dimerization domains. Alternative splicing of exon D (amino acids 386–540), which is not conserved between EWG and NRF-1, has been observed in both neuron-rich heads and neuron-poor bodies. In our analysis of Gal4 + EWG fusions, residues encoded by exon D were not required for activity; therefore our data suggest that EWG forms both containing and lacking exon D should function as transcriptional activators. Interestingly, the highly conserved region that is critical for function of the EWG activation domain is present in a single small exon, exon H, which encodes amino acids 627–668. Thus, we predict that EWG proteins derived from the observed splice variants lacking exon H would fail to activate transcription. Although transgenic studies have shown that the 116-kDa form of EWG rescues development of the indirect flight muscle, the form of EWG expressed in muscle has not been identified. It is of obvious interest to determine whether EWG activity in the nervous system and in myoblasts requires the same functional domains.We have identified evolutionarily conserved regions of EWG that contribute to DNA binding and dimerization, transcriptional activation, and regulation of the activation function. Our studies suggest that the essential function of EWG in the developing Drosophilanervous system is to regulate expression of specific target genes. Twoewg mutants have been molecularly characterized; both introduce early stop codons before the DNA binding/dimerization domain 3T. A. Bolger and G. Gill, unpublished data. (4Koushika S.P. Soller M. DeSimone S.M. Daub D.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Characterization of additional ewg mutant alleles should help confirm that the functional domains we have identified contribute to EWG functionin vivo. NRF-1 has been shown to regulate expression of nuclear encoded genes important for mitochondrial function, and NRF-1 binding sites have been implicated in the regulation of many genes involved in growth-responsive metabolic pathways as well as neuron-specific genes (8Efiok B.J.S.

In contrast to IBR/F, which has been found to repress transcription of the histoneh5 gene by binding to a site overlapping the start site of transcription (9Gomez-Cuadrado A. Martin M. Noel M. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6670-6685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gomez-Cuadrado A. Rousseau S. Renaud J. Ruiz-Carrillo A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1857-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), P3A2 acts at a distance to repress transcription. The high degree of sequence similarity between EWG, NRF-1, and P3A2 raises the possibility that EWG may also function to regulate transcription either as an activator or a repressor. In this study we show that EWG functions as a transcriptional activator and that evolutionarily conserved regions of EWG contribute both positively and negatively to transcriptional regulation. In gel mobility shift assays, an EWG dimer binds specifically to a consensus NRF-1 binding site. In Drosophila tissue culture cells, EWG activates transcription from a promoter bearing binding sites for EWG. Deletion analysis of EWG reveals a C-terminal activation domain and an N-terminal domain that inhibits transactivation. The core of the activation domain is highly conserved, and the mutation of evolutionarily conserved residues in the activation domain reduces activity. Our studies suggest that EWG participates in neurogenesis and indirect flight muscle development by directly binding to and regulating the expression of target genes important for differentiation or maintenance of these tissues. The finding that evolutionarily conserved regions of EWG contribute to transcriptional regulation suggests that EWG and its homologs in other species have maintained common mechanisms of action and regulation across evolution. DISCUSSIONWe report here that evolutionarily conserved regions of theDrosophila erect wing gene product, EWG, function to regulate transcription. Using in vitro DNA binding assays and transfection assays in Drosophila tissue culture cells, we have shown that EWG is a sequence-specific, DNA-binding protein that activates transcription from its cognate binding sites. Our analysis of EWG deletion derivatives has revealed functional roles in transcriptional regulation for each of the regions of EWG that are conserved in the human NRF-1 and sea urchin P3A2 homologs with the exception of residues 543–564. In contrast, our studies failed to reveal a critical role for the nonconserved regions of EWG. Because of this strong correlation of sequence conservation with function, it seems likely that conserved residues 543–564 contribute to EWG activity in certain physiological contexts not reproduced in our assays. Consistent with the proposal that the highly conserved region of EWG from residues 146–343 participates in nuclear localization, DNA binding, and dimerization, we have found that deletion of the sequences C-terminal to amino acid 350 does not impair DNA binding or dimerization, and deletion of the sequences N-terminal to position 144 does not reduce, but rather stimulates, site-specific activation. We have mapped the minimal activation domain to residues 564–654, which includes a highly conserved core, residues 631–654, necessary for activation. Unexpectedly, a conserved region in the N terminus was found to inhibit activation by EWG. The identification of evolutionarily conserved regions that both positively and negatively influence transcriptional activation by EWG raises the possibility that the activity of EWG and its homologs may be regulated by common mechanisms dependent upon cell type or promoter context.A wide variety of unrelated amino acid sequences has been shown to function as activation domains (22Triezenberg S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar); thus it is particularly striking that the EWG activation domain is so highly conserved. An analysis of NRF-1 deletions has revealed a major role for NRF-1 residues 449–477 in activation that corresponds well to the highly conserved core that we have shown to be critical for the function of the EWG activation domain (18Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of NRF-1, the mutation of hydrophobic residues in the activation domain also significantly reduced activation, although mutation of multiple glutamines in the activation domain had no effect (18Gugneja S. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5708-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NRF-1 has been shown to bind the coactivator PGC-1 through its DNA binding domain, but no targets of the NRF-1 activation domain have been identified (23Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). The high sequence conservation of the activation domain across evolution strongly suggests that EWG and NRF-1 activate transcription by a common mechanism. As shown in Fig. 5, the core activation domain is well conserved in the sea urchin P3A2 homolog, which has been shown to repress transcription (13Kirchhamer C.V. Davidson E.H. Development. 1996; 122: 333-348PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bogarad L.D. Arnone M.I. Chang C. Davidson E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14827-14832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in P3A2 there is alanine at the position equivalent to Val-641 in EWG because we have found that a double mutant in which alanine replaced both Val-639 and Val-641 was severely impaired for activation. Thus, it is possible that P3A2 does not activate transcription because of changes in the region homologous to the activation domain or, alternatively, that this function may be conserved and P3A2 may function both as an activator and as a repressor.Analysis of EWG deletion derivatives revealed the presence of a novel conserved inhibitory domain in the amino terminus. Deletion of residues 87–144 resulted in a 55-fold increase in activation (Fig.6 B). Modulation of transcriptional activation by EWG may be critical because overexpression of EWG in Drosophila, particularly outside the nervous system, is lethal (4Koushika S.P. Soller M. DeSimone S.M. Daub D.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previous studies with NRF-1 found that deletion of the N terminus (Δ77) resulted in decreased DNA binding, which in the case of NRF-1 was shown to be due to a defect in dimerization (21Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was therefore surprising that deletion of the N terminus of EWG resulted in increased activation, particularly because deletion of EWG residues 1–144 was also found to reduce DNA binding activity in vitro. 2 Our results suggest that the N terminus of NRF-1 may also function to inhibit activation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the N terminus of NRF-1 in response to extracellular signals has been shown to increase transcriptional activation by NRF-1 because of an increase in DNA binding (although not dimerization) (12Herzig R.P. Scacco S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13134-13141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,21Gugneja S. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18732-18739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The N terminus of NRF-1 has also been reported to interact with dynein light chains, although the functional significance of this is unknown (20Herzig R.P. Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4263-4273PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved inhibitory region is rich in acidic residues, but the sequence provides no clues as to whether inhibition involves interactions in cis with other regions of EWG or intrans with corepressor proteins. If the latter mechanism applies, it is possible that this amino-terminal domain contributes to transcriptional repression by P3A2. It will be interesting to determine whether the inhibitory activity of the EWG N terminus is modulated in response to extracellular signaling pathways or through interactions with other transcription factors at specific promoters.Expression of the 116-kDa form of EWG is enriched in theDrosophila nervous system because of differential efficiency of splicing (4Koushika S.P. Soller M. DeSimone S.M. Daub D.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several other splice variants of ewgmRNA have been described with the potential of encoding additional EWG isoforms. Our identification of functional domains in EWG supports predictions of the functions of other forms of EWG protein that may be expressed. All of the observed splice variants encode the N terminus, DNA binding, and dimerization domains. Alternative splicing of exon D (amino acids 386–540), which is not conserved between EWG and NRF-1, has been observed in both neuron-rich heads and neuron-poor bodies. In our analysis of Gal4 + EWG fusions, residues encoded by exon D were not required for activity; therefore our data suggest that EWG forms both containing and lacking exon D should function as transcriptional activators. Interestingly, the highly conserved region that is critical for function of the EWG activation domain is present in a single small exon, exon H, which encodes amino acids 627–668. Thus, we predict that EWG proteins derived from the observed splice variants lacking exon H would fail to activate transcription. Although transgenic studies have shown that the 116-kDa form of EWG rescues development of the indirect flight muscle, the form of EWG expressed in muscle has not been identified. It is of obvious interest to determine whether EWG activity in the nervous system and in myoblasts requires the same functional domains.We have identified evolutionarily conserved regions of EWG that contribute to DNA binding and dimerization, transcriptional activation, and regulation of the activation function. Our studies suggest that the essential function of EWG in the developing Drosophilanervous system is to regulate expression of specific target genes. Twoewg mutants have been molecularly characterized; both introduce early stop codons before the DNA binding/dimerization domain 3T. A. Bolger and G. Gill, unpublished data. (4Koushika S.P. Soller M. DeSimone S.M. Daub D.M. White K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Characterization of additional ewg mutant alleles should help confirm that the functional domains we have identified contribute to EWG functionin vivo. NRF-1 has been shown to regulate expression of nuclear encoded genes important for mitochondrial function, and NRF-1 binding sites have been implicated in the regulation of many genes involved in growth-responsive metabolic pathways as well as neuron-specific genes (8Efiok B.J.S.

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),1 luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone of pituitary origin and chorionic gonadotropin of placental origin belong to the family of glycoprotein hormones (1Ryan R.J.

Because these genetic disorders of mouse and men do not completely abrogate sperm production, these reports emphasize the essential role of FSH for the absolute initiation/maintenance of spermatogenesis.

Homology modeling to the ribonuclease inhibitor has provided several models of the three-dimensional structure of glycoprotein hormone receptor extracellular domains (15Jiang X. Dreano M.

As each leucine-rich repeat has 25–30 residues, we attempted to identify the hormone-binding regions of the human FSHR (hFSHR) by synthesizing peptides corresponding to hFSHR regions consisting of at least 25–30 residues. We hypothesized that FSHR synthetic peptides could replicate appropriate receptor domain conformation and bind FSH, but were unable to demonstrate such activity. Unexpectedly, we discovered an autologous acting domain of the FSHR. This finding demonstrates, in principle, the possibility of identifying autologous biological response modifiers of the G-protein-coupled receptor with knowledge of only the primary structure of the cognate receptor. These data also support the concepts that receptor-active structure is transient, that autologous biological response modifiers can stabilize the inactive state, and that hormone does not bind to the inactive state. Peptides from the extracellular domain of the hFSHR or the rat FSHR, where indicated (viz. sequences 9–30, rat; 15–44, rat; 45–72; 72–100; 101–125; 126–150; 150–183; 183–220; 221–252, rat; and 265–296), were selected for the study. Peptides 9–30, 265–296, and 221–252 derived from FSHR amino and carboxyl termini are encoded primarily within single exons. All other peptides spanned the junctions of adjacent exons. Peptides corresponding to the primary sequence of the FSHR ECD were synthesized by solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry using an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer. After cleavage from the solid support, peptides were purified by preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (C18, Delta-Pak, 19 × 300 mm). The molecular ion mass of purified peptides was determined by mass spectrometry at the Wadsworth Center Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility. Tyrosine and cysteine were incorporated into the C terminus of each peptide to enable iodination or conjugation to carrier proteins, respectively. In some experiments, free thiols in peptides were derivatized to assess the effects on peptide activity. For derivatization, 10 mg of the hFSHR-(221–252) Tyr-Cys peptide was dissolved in 2 ml of buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3). Aliquots (5 μl) of freshly prepared 0.5 m iodoacetamide in water were added at 5-min intervals. The reaction was monitored by the method of Ellman (17Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21473) Google Scholar) using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Addition of iodoacetamide was continued until all the sulfhydryl groups were modified. The solution was then diluted with 5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to reversed-phase preparative HPLC. Following purification, the modified peptide was characterized by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. To determine the effect of charge on peptide activity, ε-NH2groups of lysine residues were modified using acetic anhydride (18Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Holden-Day, San Francisco1971: 214-215Google Scholar). Pure hFSHR-(221–254) peptide (7.0 mg) was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 0.05m sodium acetate buffer. Acetic anhydride (25 μl) was added over a period of 2 h (5 μl at a time) with stirring. The pH was maintained at 8.0 throughout the reaction. After the last addition, the peptide was dialyzed against 0.05 m ammonium acetate for mass spectrometry or 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer for CD spectroscopy. Peptides or anti-peptide antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of hFSH to its receptor in a RRA. Deoxyuridine-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells (19Kelton C.A. Cheng S.V.Y. Nugent N.P. Schweichkhardt R.L. Rosenthal J.L. Overton S.A. Wands G.D. Kuzeja J.B. Luchette C.A. Chappel S.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 89: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) stably transfected with the hFSHR (CHO-hFSHR) and obtained from Ares Advanced Technologies (Randolph, MA) were used as a source of hFSHR. CHO-hFSHR cells were washed twice and left for 15 min in EDTA/PBS buffer. Cells were dislodged, counted, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in RRA buffer (0.05m Tris and 0.25 m MgCl2 (pH 7.5)) and stored frozen (10 × 107 cells/ml). For competitive displacement, 125I-hFSH (150,000 cpm, 25 μCi/μg) in RRA buffer with 0.3% bovine serum albumin was used as the tracer for binding to the hFSHR (2.5 × 105 cells) (20Roth K.E. Dias J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The RRA was carried out in a reaction volume of 400 μl. Increasing concentrations of hFSH or receptor peptide (100μl) were preincubated with 125I-hFSH (100 μl) for 1 h at room temperature. CHO-hFSHR cells were then added and incubated overnight at room temperature with shaking. When antibodies to hFSHR peptides were used, they were preincubated with 2.5 × 105 CHO-hFSHR cells for 4 h at 4 °C. Radiolabeled hFSH was then added, and the tubes were shaken overnight at room temperature. At all concentrations of peptide or antibody tested, controls were included in which pure hFSH (1 μg) was added to assess nonspecific binding. To separate bound from free hFSH, the assay was terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold 0.05 m Tris (pH 7.5) and pelleting cells at 2500 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant from each tube was aspirated, and the radioactivity in each pellet was determined using a γ-counter (Wallac 1470 Wizard). In the case of the hCG RRA, CHO cells expressing the human LHR obtained from Ares Advanced Technologies were used as the receptor source, and 125I-hCG was used as the tracer (CR127; 10 μCi/μg). In some experiments, membrane-bound or truncated receptors were solubilized using the detergent Nonidet P-40. Truncated forms of the hFSHR ECD were prepared as previously described (21Peterson A.J. Lindau-Shepard B. Brumberg H.A. Dias J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 160: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A CHO cell line (D7) stably expressing the hFSH-(1–335) variant was utilized. CHO cells expressing either the full-length hFSHR (1.5 × 106 cells/100 μl) or hFSHR ECD (clone D7, hFSHR-(1–335); 4 × 106 cells/100 μl) were solubilized using 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (in 0.05 m Tris, 0.025 mMgCl2, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, and 30% glycerol). Antibodies at different concentrations (100 μl) were incubated with the solubilized receptor preparation (100 μl) at 4 °C for 4 h; then the tracer was added (150,000 cpm/100 μl); and the incubation was continued at 4 °C overnight. To separate bound from free hFSH, the assay was terminated by precipitation of the hFSH·hFSHR complexes using polyethylene glycol. To each tube were added 200 μl of γ-globulin (2% in 0.05 m Tris (pH 7.5)), 500 μl of RRA buffer, and 1 ml of 25% polyethylene glycol in PBS. Tubes were allowed to stand on ice for 15 min and then were spun at 4 °C for 1 h at 2500 × g. The supernatant was aspirated, and the radioactivity in the pellets was counted in a γ-counter. The data obtained were processed using the computer program LIGAND (33Dattatreyamurty B. Reichert Jr., L.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 87: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The effect of hFSHR peptides on signal transduction was evaluated by an in vitro FSH bioassay (19Kelton C.A. Cheng S.V.Y. Nugent N.P. Schweichkhardt R.L. Rosenthal J.L. Overton S.A. Wands G.D. Kuzeja J.B. Luchette C.A. Chappel S.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 89: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Y-1 cells stably expressing FSHRs (Ares Advanced Technologies) were cultured in 48-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/500 μl/well in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 80 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was replaced with fresh medium on the third day. On the fourth day, cells were rinsed with Y-1 cell assay medium (Eagle's medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% glutamine) and treated with different concentrations of hFSH or peptide with or without 1 ng of hFSH (ID50) and then incubated for 20–24 h. All the incubations were carried out at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After the last incubation, the medium from each well was transferred to a glass tube, heated for 10 min at 100 °C, and spun at 2500 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were decanted and assayed for progesterone or stored frozen at −20 °C until assayed. Progesterone secreted in the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. Samples were diluted with PBS-G (0.1% gelatin in PBS with 0.02% sodium azide) and incubated with 100 μl (1:2500) of sheep anti-progesterone antiserum (GDN 337, obtained from Dr. Gordon Niswender, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO), 100 μl (25,000 dpm) of [3H]progesterone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in PBS-G, and 200 μl of PBS-G overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, 0.5 ml of dextran-coated charcoal was added to the tubes and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C to separate bound from free progesterone. The tubes were spun at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were decanted into 20-ml scintillation vials, and 10 ml of Aquasol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. Vials were vortexed and counted in a β-counter (Wallac Model 1409), and data were processed using the NIHRIA program (22Yanagishita M. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 88: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The hFSHR-(221–252) peptide was conjugated to ovalbumin through the C-terminal –SH of cysteine, which was incorporated during the synthesis for this purpose. Sulfo(succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl))cyclohexane 1-carboxylate was used as the cross-linking reagent (23Weiner R.S. Dias J.A. Andersen T.T. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The conjugate was used to immunize two Flemish giant female rabbits (X-180 and X-183). Immunoglobulins were purified using protein A-Sepharose (Bio-Rad antibody purification kit) following the manufacturer's instructions. IgG fractions were dialyzed overnight against 0.05 m Tris (pH 7.5), lyophilized, and stored at −90 °C. Nonimmune rabbit serum and antiserum against the hFSHR-(265–296) peptide (24Liu X. Depasquale J.A. Griswold M.D. Dias J.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were also processed similarly to use as negative and positive controls, respectively. Fab′ fragments from purified IgG were generated by digestion with papain (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-peptide antibody was screened using an ELISA to detect binding to corresponding peptides. Microtiter wells (Nunc Maxisorp) were incubated overnight with peptide (1 μg/100 μl) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.4). After the unabsorbed peptide was removed, the wells were blocked with PBS-G (200 μl) for 2 h at 37 °C. Dilutions of antisera (100 μl) in PBS-G with 0.05% Tween 20 were added to the wells and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. This was followed by addition of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (100 μl, 1:4000; Pierce) and further incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Substrate (200 μl) containing 25 μl of hydrogen peroxide and 4 mg of o-phenylenediamine in 10 ml of citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) was added and incubated in the dark for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 4 nH2SO4 (100 μl). Absorbance was determined at 492 nm. For competition experiments, serial dilutions of the parent peptide, its fragments, or an unrelated peptide were preincubated with the antisera before addition to the microtiter wells. To confirm that antibodies to peptide 221–252 bind to the hFSHR, denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a discontinuous buffer system (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) was carried out. D7 cells (5 × 106) expressing the FSHR ECD were solubilized for 30 min at room temperature in 500 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (0.25m Tris (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.24% bromphenol blue) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (100× protease inhibitor mixture = 1.6 mg/ml benzamidine HCl, 1 mg/ml phenanthroline, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin A in 100% ethanol), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 8m urea. Electrophoresis chambers were cooled in ice baths. The gels were 7.5% polyacrylamide and made 8 m with urea. 18 μl of cell suspension was added per lane. After electrophoretic separation, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting (47Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar) for 45 min at 250 mA. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with Protein Images blocking solution (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 (TBST), 2% nonfat dry milk, 1% ovalbumin, and plain CHO cell extract (1 × 106 cells/10 ml) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The blots were washed with TBST and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, TX) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed and developed with Western blue-stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI). To determine whether the hFSHR-(221–252) domain was accessible to antibodies in native receptor present on CHO-hFSHR cells, flow cytometric analysis was carried out. Confluent cells were washed with EDTA/PBS and then incubated with the same buffer for 10–15 min. The cells were dislodged from the culture flasks and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. After aspiration of the supernatant, cells were suspended in PBSA (PBS with 0.02% sodium azide). CHO-hFSHR cells (106 cells/100 μl) were added to each tube. Human serum (50 μl) was incubated with the cells on ice for 1 h to block nonspecific sites. Purified rabbit IgG (50 μg/50 μl) from control serum or antiserum against the hFSHR-(221–252) or hFSHR-(265–296) peptide was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed with 2 ml of PBSA, pelleted, resuspended in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (200 μl, 1:40 dilution), and incubated for 1 h on ice. Cells were then pelleted, washed, and resuspended in 2 ml of PBSA. Cell-surface immunofluorescence was measured using a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson FACScan). Circular dichroism analyses were performed to assess the bulk solvent environment of the conformation of the hFSHR-(221–254) peptide. Experiments were carried out on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C using a cell with a path length of 0.05 mm. In one series of experiments, peptides were dissolved in 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and spectra were obtained in a series of solutions containing from 0 to 50% trifluoroethanol, increasing in steps of 5%. In another set of experiments, peptides were dissolved in water; phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was added to 25 mm, and dodecyl phosphocholine was added to 5.0 or 22.0 mm; the solution was incubated overnight at room temperature; and spectra were obtained at 20 and 37 °C at a peptide concentration of 0.5 mm. All data were analyzed using the computer program SELCON (25Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 26Sreerama N. Woody R.W.

All spectra of hFSHR-(221–252) were taken of a sample at 1.75 mm in 90% H2O, 25 mm CD3COOD, 100 mm KCl, and 0.01% NaN3 (pH 4.5) at 305 K. Data were recorded at 500 MHz for protons. A variety of data sets were taken. Several one-dimensional 1H spectra were obtained with a spectral width of 6000 Hz, with 8192 complex data points collected during acquisition. Spectra were processed with appropriate exponential/gaussian multiplication. Two-dimensional 1H TOCSY spectra with gradient excitation sculpting for water suppression were recorded (48Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 557-564Google Scholar). In each case, an isotropic mixing time of 35 ms was employed to emphasize correlations between amide and α-protons. Two-dimensional 1H NOESY spectra with gradient excitation sculpting for water suppression were recorded (49Jeener J. Meier P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4838) Google Scholar). In each case, a mixing time of 120 ms was employed for generation of nuclear Overhauser effects. For the two-dimensional spectra, spectral widths were 6000 Hz in both the direct and indirect dimensions. Data sets were 8192 × 512 complex points in the direct and indirect dimensions, respectively. Spectra were processed with exponential/gaussian multiplication in the direct dimension and a quadratic sine-bell in the indirect dimension. Experiments were carried out on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter at 6 °C using a cell with a path length of 0.05 cm. The purified hFSHR ECD was dialyzed against 0.01 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) overnight prior to the measurements. Spectra were measured with the following settings: 1.0-nm bandwidth, speed of 20 nm/min, 0.2-nm resolution, and wavelength between 260 and 180 nm with five accumulations per measurement to improve noise-to-signal ratio. The buffer blank measured under the same conditions was subtracted from the sample spectra. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. To analyze the influence of dodecyl phosphocholine on the structure of the hFSHR ECD, protein was incubated with either 20 mm dodecyl phosphocholine or buffer overnight at 4 °C, and the spectra were taken the following day. All data were analyzed using the Jasco software and the computer program SELCON3 (25Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 26Sreerama N.

Data presented herein have been analyzed based on a data base containing 29 proteins within the wavelength range from 178 to 260 nm (29Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by HPLC to homogeneity. The observed molecular mass of each purified peptide as determined by mass spectrometry was, for the most part, as expected. We did note that when a C-terminal cysteine was engineered into the peptide, an additional mass of ∼50 Da was always detected. This was not the case if the cysteine was at the N terminus. Peptides representing FSHR sequences 45–72 and 150–183 were not soluble in RRA buffer. Sequence listing mis-transcription resulted in synthesis errors in peptides representing FSHR sequences 105–125 and 126–150 of Gln to Gly and of Glu to Val, respectively. The hFSHR sequence of Minegishi et al. (30Minegishi T. Nakamura K. Takakura Y. Ibuki Y. Igarashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was used for peptides representing hFSHR sequences 72–100 and 265–296. Peptides representing FSHR sequences 9–30, 15–44, 101–125, 126–150, 183–220, 221–252, and 265–296 were purified and then screened in the hFSH RRA to determine whether they affected binding of hFSH to the receptor. The remaining peptides were not soluble in RRA buffer and could not be tested. The hFSHR-(221–252) peptide (Fig.1) was found to inhibit binding of hFSH to CHO-hFSHR cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). This effect was specific to the FSHR, as the peptide did not inhibit hCG binding to the human LHR (Fig. 2 B). The hFSHR-(221–252) peptide had a cysteine incorporated at the C terminus for the purpose of conjugation to a carrier protein. To rule out the possibility of involvement of free –SH in the observed inhibition of FSH binding to receptor, this group was modified with iodoacetamide. The alkylated peptide still exhibited binding inhibition (data not shown). There are five lysines in this peptide as compared with two in the corresponding region of the human LHR (Fig. 1). To determine whether these lysines participated in electrostatic interactions that affect peptide activity and specificity, ε-NH2 groups of lysines were modified with acetic anhydride. Incorporation of acetyl groups was confirmed by mass spectrometry. All five lysine ε-NH2 groups were modified, and the modification eliminated the activity of the peptide (data not shown). The peptide was also re-synthesized as hFSHR-(221–254) by removing Tyr and Cys at the C terminus (used for iodination and conjugations, respectively) and including two additional residues, Thr and Tyr, as found in the native sequence. This peptide also retained its activity (Fig. 3). To determine if charge alone could account for the binding inhibition, two subregions of the hFSHR-(221–254) peptide (hFSHR-(221–237) and hFSHR-(238–254)) were synthesized and characterized as described earlier. When tested in the RRA peptide challenge test, peptide 221–237 had no activity, and peptide 238–254 caused high nonspecific binding and had minimal activity at the highest dose tested (Fig. 3). As this daughter peptide was found to be relatively insoluble, higher doses could n"

A different role is attributed to the A tract when it is positioned upstream and in phase with the promoter elements. A number of Escherichia coli promoters have A+T-rich tracts (also known as UP elements) upstream to the −35 hexamer of ς70 promoters (12Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salmon J. Igarashi J. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 13Giladi H. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Oppenheim A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). UP elements, when present, are integral components of promoters, because they interact with the carboxy terminal domain of the RNAP α-subunit (12Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salmon J. Igarashi J. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that the E. coli RNAP (ς70) holoenzyme alone is sufficient for transcriptional activity from several such promoters (12Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salmon J. Igarashi J. Zou C.

The regulatory region of the mom operon of bacteriophage Mu, which controls a unique DNA modification function (see Ref. 16Hattman S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 367-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar for a recent review), exhibits several interesting features. The promoter,momP1, which directs the transcription of com-momdicistronic mRNA, is a typical example of a weak promoter with a poor −35 (ACCACA) element and a suboptimal spacing of 19 bp between the two consensus elements (Fig. 1 a). The spacer region of the promoter contains a run of six T nucleotides from −12 to −17. RNAP does not bind to momP1 by itself (17Balke V. Nagaraja V. Gindlesperger T. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2777-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Instead it binds an overlapping, divergent promoter region, momP2, which brings about “leftward” transcription (18Sun W. Hattman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The stretch of six A nucleotides complementary to the T6 run appears to be part of an UP element for leftward transcription from momP2 (18Sun W. Hattman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The regulation of mom operon expression occurs at both the transcriptional and translational levels (16Hattman S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 367-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Mu C protein, a “middle” gene product, is an obligatory transcriptional activator of the momP1 promoter (19Hattman S. Ives J. Margolin W. Howe M.M. Gene. 1985; 39: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Heisig P. Kahmann R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 43: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), as well as for the other three late promoters (21Bölker M. Wulczyn F.G. Kahmann R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chiang L.W. Howe M.M. Genetics. 1993; 135: 619-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C protein binding to a site located at −28 to −57 in the momP1 region (23Gindlesperger T.L. Hattman S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2885-2891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24De A. Ramesh V. Mahadevan S. Nagaraja V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3831-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) brings about an asymmetric distortion and unwinding of the DNA (25Ramesh V. Nagaraja V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Sun W. Hattman S. Kool E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27Basak S. Nagaraja V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mutants have been isolated that relieve the dependence ofmomP1 on C activation. In one such (partially) C-independent mutant, tin7, there is a single-base change (T to G at position −14) that disrupts the T6 run in themomP1 spacer region (17Balke V. Nagaraja V. Gindlesperger T. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2777-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Few explanations could account for the increased promoter activity of tin7 mutant: 1) T tract-mediated intrinsic DNA curvature is lost because of disruption of the T6 run (to T3GT2), resulting in RNAP binding tomomP1; 2) because P1 and P2 are overlapping divergent promoters, weakening of the UP element of momP2 (18Sun W. Hattman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) may facilitate the binding and activity of RNAP at momP1; and 3) the T(−14) to G change converts momP1 to an extended −10 promoter (28Keilty S. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6389-6395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study is an attempt to delineate the role of the T6 run in momP1 promoter activity. E. coli DH10B was used for generating the different plasmid constructs. E. coli LL306 Δ(pro-lac) was from L. Lindahl (29Zengel J.M. Mueckl D. Lindahl L. Cell. 1980; 21: 523-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Plasmid pVN184 (+), a C protein-producing construct, has been described earlier (17Balke V. Nagaraja V. Gindlesperger T. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2777-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The primers used in this study to generate site-directed mutants or synthetic duplexes are available upon request. Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Stratagene, New England Biolabs, and Roche Molecular Biochemicals and were used according to the suppliers' recommendations. DNase I was from Worthington, and E. coli DNA polymerase (PolIk) was from New England Biolabs. Superscript reverse transcriptase was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Chemicals and other reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Sigma. Primers were synthesized by Bangalore Genei (Pvt.) Ltd. (Bangalore, India), Life Technologies, Inc., and the University of Rochester Core Lab Facility. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from New England Nuclear. Most of the standard procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The mutants used in this study were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using either pLW4 (17Balke V. Nagaraja V. Gindlesperger T. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2777-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or pUW4 (31Ramesh V. De A. Nagaraja V. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as the template DNA. pUW4 was used as template for the polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis methods. The mutants, pT2G, pT3G, and pT2GT3G (Fig. 1 b), were generated by using the Stratagene QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method involving a pair of mutagenic oligonucleotides andPfuI DNA polymerase. The mutant pT3C was generated by using a Promega Gene Editor site-directed mutagenesis kit. pT1C, pT5C, pT4C, pWT-P2, ptin7-P2, pT2GT3G-P2, and pG21C were generated by using the modified mega primer method. In this method, a mega primer was first generated using the pUC reverse primer and the mutagenic oligonucleotide (as described in Ref. 32Dutta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The mega primer was then used in the Stratagene QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method. All of the mutants generated in the pUW4 background were subcloned into pLW4 using EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes to generate the promoter mutants as lacZtranscriptional fusions. All of the mutants generated were confirmed by carrying out Sanger's dideoxy method of sequencing (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The promoter expression plasmid pLC1 (22Chiang L.W. Howe M.M. Genetics. 1993; 135: 619-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. M. M. Howe; it contains anEcoRI-SmaI-BamHI linker upstream of a promoterless lacZ gene. Plasmid pLO1 was created by cloning the smaller PstI-BamHI fragment from pLC1 into pRSGC3 SmaI (a derivative of phagemid pGC1; Ref. 33Myers R.M. Lerman L.S. Maniatis T. Science. 1985; 229: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A synthetic duplex containing either momP1 or momP2 was generated by annealing pairs of appropriate synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides that had appropriately located 5′EcoRI and 5′ BamHI single-strand overhangs. Plasmids pLO1/P1 and pLO1/P2 were constructed by ligating the synthetic duplexes into the EcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively, of pLO1 and were used for generating site-directed mutations in momP1 and momP2, respectively. After DNA sequencing confirmed the nature of each mutation, themom promoter-containing PstI-BamHI fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites in pLC1 for promoter expression analyses (additional details of the plasmid and mutant constructions are available upon request). Isolated colonies of E. coli DH10B cells harboring either a promoter mutant plasmid alone or with plasmid pVN184 were inoculated into LB broth containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin (for mutant promoter plasmids alone) or ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol (both plasmids present); the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for ∼16 h with vigorous shaking. The overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into 3 ml of fresh medium in duplicate tubes and incubated at 37 °C till the cultures reached an A600 of 0.3–0.7. The samples were then placed on ice. β-Galactosidase activity in SDS-CHCl3-treated cells was determined as described by Miller (34Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). In the experiments with plasmid pLC1 constructs, β-galactosidase assays were carried out with exponential cultures grown from isolated colonies. The values in the tables are the averages from at least two separate experiments, and replicate assays were done on each culture. The variation was 10–20% around the mean value. 2.0 μg (∼0.36 pmol) of negatively supercoiled DNA was incubated with DNase I (final concentration, 0.1 ng/μl) in presence of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. After 30 s at 22 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 20 μl of stop buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS). The sample volume was made to be 400 μl with water and extracted successively with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and then precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 100% (v/v) ethanol in the presence of glycogen as a carrier. Primer extension protocol is adapted from Gralla (35Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The extension reactions were performed with end-labeled momforward and reverse primers as previously described (27Basak S. Nagaraja V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For the (OP)2Cu cleavage reaction, 2.0 μg of negatively supercoiled DNA was incubated with a 10-μl sample of 4 mm1,10-phenanthroline, 0.3 mm CuSO4, and 10 μl of 58 mm 3-mercaptopropionic acid on ice for 1 min. Reactions were quenched by adding 7.0 μl of 100 mm2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline; the samples were then deproteinized by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) extractions, and the DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 100% (v/v) ethanol. The DNA was used for primer extension with end-labeled mom forward and mom reverse primers. In vivo KMnO4 footprinting reaction was carried out as described by Sasse-Dwight and Gralla (36Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli DH10B cells harboring a momP1 promoter mutant plasmid alone or along with pVN184 were grown to A600 0.6 in 4.0 ml of LB broth. The cultures were treated with 200 μg/ml rifampicin for 20 min. The samples were then incubated with 30 mmKMnO4 for 2 min. Reactions were stopped by transferring the cultures to prechilled tubes. The cells were harvested, and plasmid DNA was isolated. Primer extension reactions were carried out as described above. Total RNA was isolated from E. coli DH10B cells harboring the various promoter mutant plasmids using the hot acid phenol method. Primer extension was carried out as per the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.) using superscript reverse transcriptase and end-labeled mom forward (for momP2 transcript detection) and reverse (for momP1 transcript detection) primers. An end-labeled primer annealing 150 bases downstream of the ampicillin transcription +1 start site was used to normalize the levels of transcripts produced in the different mutant promoter constructs. Scanning of the autoradiographs was carried out using a Bio-Rad GS710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer. Quantification was done using Quantity One software. The variation in helical structure of the DNA depends on base sequence. Specific sequences contribute to alterations in groove width and DNA curvature (37Calladine C.R. Drew H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition to their use in probing DNA-protein interactions, nucleases are often used to detect distortions in DNA. Cleavage reaction of orthophenanthroline cuprous complex ((OP)2Cu) depends on the local DNA structure rather than the base sequences as demonstrated previously by Spassky et al. (38Spassky A. Rimsky S. Buc H. Busby S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1871-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We used (OP)2Cu to probe possible structural or conformational differences between the wild type (WT) and thetin7 mutant in the region of the T6 tract inmomP1 (Fig. 1). Negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA harboring the WT or tin7 mutantmomP1 promoter was subjected to in vitro single hit cleavage, and the sensitivity pattern was assessed by primer extension analysis (Experimental Procedures). The results of a typical (OP)2Cu footprinting are shown in Fig.2 (a and b). The sensitivity patterns of both the top and the bottom strands in the region containing the T6 run were different for the two promoters. Several hypersensitive sites are seen in the WT that are not reactive in tin7. For example, at −14T (top strand) and at −15A, −16A, −17A, and −18C (bottom strand), the WT was cleaved more often by (OP)2Cu. In contrast, tin7 DNA was relatively refractory to cleavage by (OP)2Cu at these residues, whereas −10A in the top strand was hypersensitive. We also probed the promoter structure by using DNase I as a footprinting agent. DNase I reaction also revealed substantial differences in cleavage sensitivity patterns (indicated by the asterisks in Fig.2 c, lanes 1 and 2). DNase I cleavage gave rise to two hypersensitive sites, at −9G and −17T (top strand) in the WT promoter, compared with hypersensitive sites at −12T and −13T (in the T6 run) of the tin7 promoter. These results show that the two promoter regions differ in their susceptibility to nuclease cleavage, indicating that the DNA conformations are different. Because the T4G (tin7) mutant showed a difference in DNA conformation with respect to wild type, the effect of base substitutions at other position in the T6 run were examined. To this end, negatively supercoiled DNAs of various mutants were subjected to in vitro cleavage with DNase I. Mutants T2G, T3G, T2GT3G, and T4G (tin7) were selected as representatives for this analysis (Fig. 2 c). The mutants showed hypersensitivity patterns different from one another, as well as from the WT. For example, the top strand residue −14T was cleaved more frequently in T2G, whereas −12T, −14T, and −16T were hypersensitive in T3G, and −12T and −14T were hypersensitive in T2GT3G. The narrower minor groove of the A/T tract is altered by the G substitutions, leading to its widening at these positions. As a consequence, different DNase I-hypersensitive sites are observed (marked byasterisks in Fig. 2 c) in each of the mutants; (OP)2Cu footprinting analysis gave analogous results (not shown). Because both DNase I and (OP)2Cu-mediated DNA cleavages are in the minor groove (39Spassky A Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8050-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 40Kuwabara M.D. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the T6 run mutations appear to change the DNA conformation in the minor groove. This is further supported by an altered migration pattern of DNA fragments in polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). The differences in chemical nuclease and enzymatic cleavage patterns of WT and mutant T6 run promoters reflect structural differences among these promoters. To determine whether the changes also influence promoter activity, promoter-lacZ fusion constructs were generated for all of the mutants, and promoter strength was assessed indirectly by measuring β-galactosidase activity in cells harboring these plasmids. Moreover, the C-activated level was analyzed in cells also harboring a compatible C-producing plasmid, pVN184. T6 run mutants T2G, T2C, T3G, T3C, T2GT3G, and T5C produced 5–26-fold higher levels of enzyme compared with the WT promoter (TableI); in contrast, T1C and T4C showed little or no increased expression. However, all of the mutants remained responsive to transactivation by C protein (Table I), producing enzyme levels comparable with that of the activated WT momP1 promoter. Thus, all of the mutant promoters are C protein-dependent for their full activity, indicating that the C transactivation mechanism was unaltered. As a control, the mutation G21C was created (shown in Fig. 1 b) upstream from the T6 run yet within the spacer region. As expected, this mutant showed levels of β-galactosidase activity comparable with the WT momP1 promoter in the absence and in the presence of C protein (Table I). The variable increase in momP1 promoter activity among these mutants could be due to differences in their perturbations of DNA structure as shown in Fig. 2. None of the mutant promoters showed activity as high as that of T4G (tin7), which showed an increase that was between 46- and 80-fold depending on the type of fusion examined (Tables I andII). These results suggest that in addition to DNA distortion, an alternative mechanism might be operating in tin7, most likely having an extended −10 promoter because of the specific base substitution at −14 position (discussed further below).Table IProduction of β-galactosidase activity in E. coli DH10B cells containing a pLW4-momP1 promoter-lacZ fusion derivative ± compatible plasmid pVN184momP1 mutantLacZ (−C protein)Relative activity 1-aThe relative β-galactosidase activity with the WT promoter in the absence of C protein is defined as 1.0.

See “Experimental Procedures” for growth of cells and enzyme assays. The above experiments were carried out using a momP1 promoter directing production of a Com-LacZ translational fusion. We carried out similar experiments with a momP1 promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusion vector. This was constructed by subcloning momP1 mutations (T4G, T4A, T4C, T3G, T3A, and T3C, produced in a momP1-containing synthetic oligonucleotide duplex) into a site 5′ to a promoterless, reporterlacZ gene (see “Experimental Procedures”), andmomP1 promoter activity was assayed by measuring β-galactosidase activity. As seen in Table II, the substitutions generated variable increases in enzyme level, in good agreement with the results observed with the pLW4 plasmid system. Most interesting are the three T4X substitutions. First, the T4G mutant had the highest level of C-independent expression, 80-fold above the WT. In contrast, T4A had a 6-fold increase, whereas T4C showed no increase. Thus, the three different T4X substitutions produced three different phenotypes. We suggest that the high level of constitutive expression by T4G (tin7) is due to its having an extended −10 promoter, in addition to the alteration in DNA conformation. In contrast, the T4A (as well as the T3A) substitution appears to only affectmomP1 DNA conformation, indicating that T-A to A-T base pair alterations can also affect conformation. At first glance, it was surprising that the T4C mutant did not show increased momP1 expression; however, as will be shown below, the T4C mutant does not exhibit any structural difference from the WT based on in vitro cleavage. Finally, it should be noted that the T2G and T3G mutations create a TG at positions −17 and −16 and at positions −16 and −15, respectively. Although these mutations exhibited enzyme levels severalfold higher than the WT, they do not appear to provide extended −10 functional capability. In view of the different levels of momP1 expression observed with the three T4X mutations, we compared their in vitrosensitivity to cleavage by DNase I. As shown in Fig. 2 d, the T4C promoter region showed a cleavage pattern similar to that of the WT, which is in sharp contrast to all of the other T6 run mutants. Because the T4C substitution does not appear to alter the WTmomP1 DNA conformation, we suggest that it possesses the same unfavorable distortion as the WT and, hence, requires protein C activation for any transcription. Increased β-galactosidase levels with certain T6 mutant momP1 promoters indicate increased transcription initiation capability. Interaction of RNAP at a promoter can be ascertained by assessing open complex formation using anin vivo KMnO4 footprinting technique (36Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli DH10B cells harboring a T6 mutant pLW4 plasmid in the absence or the presence of the C protein-producing plasmid, pVN184, were probed (see “Experimental Procedures”). In accordance with its high level of constitutive promoter activity in the absence of C protein, tin7 showed hypersensitive bands (Fig.3, lane 4) characteristic of open complex formation; the observed pattern was in good agreement with the results of Balke et al. (17Balke V. Nagaraja V. Gindlesperger T. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2777-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Open complex formation in the absence of C protein was also observed with mutants T2G and T2GT3G (Figs. 3, lane 12, and4 a, lane 10). However, open complexes were not detected with T3G, T3C, and T2C (Fig.3, lanes 8, 10, and 14, respectively), which correlates with their relatively lower levels of β-galactosidase expression (in the absence of C protein). As could be predicted from the promoter strength analysis (Table I), the WTmomP1 promoter and the T4C mutant were unable to produce detectable open complexes (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 6, respectively). In the presence of C protein, however, all pr"
