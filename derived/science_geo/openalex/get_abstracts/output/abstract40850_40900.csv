https://openalex.org/W2066121768,"Cells with properties characteristic of mononuclear phagocytes were evaluated for infectivity with five different isolates of the AIDS virus, HTLV-III/LAV. Mononuclear phagocytes cultured from brain and lung tissues of AIDS patients harbored the virus. In vitro-infected macrophages from the peripheral blood, bone marrow, or cord blood of healthy donors produced large quantities of virus. Virus production persisted for at least 40 days and was not dependent on host cell proliferation. Giant multinucleated cells were frequently observed in the macrophage cultures and numerous virus particles, often located within vacuole-like structures, were present in infected cells. The different virus isolates were compared for their ability to infect macrophages and T cells. Isolates from lung- and brain-derived macrophages had a significantly higher ability to infect macrophages than T cells. In contrast, the prototype HTLV-III beta showed a 10,000-fold lower ability to infect macrophages than T cells and virus production was one-tenth that in macrophage cultures infected with other isolates, indicating that a particular variant of HTLV-III/LAV may have a preferential tropism for macrophages or T cells. These results suggest that mononuclear phagocytes may serve as primary targets for infection and agents for virus dissemination and that these virus-infected cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2035072797,"The production and action of immunoregulatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), are inhibited by glucocorticoid hormones in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, glucocorticoid blood levels were increased by factors released by human leukocytes exposed to Newcastle disease virus preparations. This activity was neutralized by an antibody to IL-1. Therefore the capacity of IL-1 to stimulate the pituitary-adrenal axis was tested. Administration of subpyrogenic doses of homogeneous human monocyte-derived IL-1 or the pI 7 form of human recombinant IL-1 to mice and rats increased blood levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoids. Another monokine, tumor necrosis factor, and the lymphokines IL-2 and gamma-interferon had no such effects when administered in doses equivalent to or higher than those of IL-1. The stimulatory effect of IL-1 on the pituitary-adrenal axis seemed not to be mediated by the secondary release of products from mature T lymphocytes since IL-1 was endocrinologically active when injected into athymic nude mice. These results strongly support the existence of an immunoregulatory feedback circuit in which IL-1 acts as an afferent and glucocorticoid as an efferent hormonal signal."

https://openalex.org/W2159348779,"We find DNA fragments attached to the nuclear scaffold (SARs) both 5' and 3' of three Drosophila genes, defining looped domains ranging from 4.5 to 13 kb. For the two-promoter-containing gene Adh (alcohol dehydrogenase), we find two upstream and two downstream SARs. For Sgs-4, the 5' SAR covers 866 bp immediately upstream of the transcript, and in the case of fushi tarazu, the 5' SAR is found on a small fragment 4.8 kb upstream of the start of transcription. These four upstream scaffold-attached fragments comap with enhancer-like regulatory sequences. Sequence analysis of five upstream SARs reveals clusters of sequences closely related to the cleavage consensus of topoisomerase II, several copies of a specific 10 bp A-rich sequence (AATAAATCAAA), and another 10 bp T-rich stretch."
https://openalex.org/W1543530330,"Intense lipid peroxidation of brain synaptosomes initiated with Fenton's reagent (H2O2 + Fe2+) began instantly upon addition of Fe2+ and preceded detectable OH. formation. Although mannitol or Tris partially blocked peroxidation, concentrations required were 10(3)-fold in excess of OH. actually formed, and inhibition by Tris was pH dependent. Lipid peroxidation also was initiated by either Fe2+ or Fe3+ alone, although significant lag phases (minutes) and slowed reaction rates were observed. Lag phases were dramatically reduced or nearly eliminated, and reaction rates were increased by a combination of Fe3+ and Fe2+. In this instance, lipid peroxidation initiated by optimal concentrations of H2O2 and Fe2+ could be mimicked or even surpassed by providing optimal ratios of Fe3+ to Fe2+. Peroxidation observed with Fe3+ alone was dependent upon trace amounts of contaminating Fe2+ in Fe3+ preparations. Optimal ratios of Fe3+:Fe2+ for the rapid initiation of lipid peroxidation were on order of 1:1 to 7:1. No OH. formation could be detected with this system. Although low concentrations of H2O2 or ascorbate increased lipid peroxidation by Fe2+ or Fe3+, respectively, high concentrations of H2O2 or ascorbate (in excess of iron) inhibited lipid peroxidation due to oxidative or reductive maintenance of iron exclusively in Fe2+ or Fe3+ form. Stimulation of lipid peroxidation by low concentrations of H2O2 or ascorbate was due to the oxidative or reductive creation of Fe3+:Fe2+ ratios. The data suggest that the absolute ratio of Fe3+ to Fe2+ was the primary determining factor for the initiation of lipid peroxidation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2124731827,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has not yet been propagated in vitro, and knowledge concerning its reaction with receptors on target cells remained scant. We have located within the HBV envelope proteins a sequence mediating the attachment of HBV to human hepatoma HepG2 cells. A synthetic peptide analog (PLGFFPDHQLDPAFGANSNNPDWDFNP) is recognized by both cell receptors and anti-HBV antibodies and elicits antibodies reacting with native HBV. The synthetic peptide is a promising immunogen expected to elicit protective antibodies based on the concept of the attachment blockade pathway of virus neutralization. The approach described here, based on anti-peptide antisera and the binding of peptide analogs to cell receptors is generally applicable for the delineation of cell receptor binding sites on viruses with known gene sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1586437812,"Hormonal regulatory elements within the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) promoter region were mapped using a series of 5' deletions linked to the amino-3'-glycosyl phosphotransferase structural gene. These deletion mutants were stably transfected into the genome of FTO-2B hepatoma cells. A 47-base pair region of the PEPCK promoter was identified which was essential for stimulation by dibutyryl cAMP. A 12-base pair core sequence (CTTACGTCAGAG) within this region shows significant homology with sequences in four other cAMP-regulated genes. There are two glucocorticoid regulatory elements within the promoter, as well as an inhibitory element which depresses the level of basal gene transcription. The deletion of this inhibitory sequence prevents the induction of the chimeric gene by dexamethasone. The existence of the hormone regulatory domains within the PEPCK promoter was confirmed by attaching these elements upstream of the heterologous Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase structural gene, containing its own promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2053452111,"A single gene (Prn-i) that affects scrapie incubation period in mice has been identified. I/LnJ mice have a very long incubation period after inoculation of scrapie prions (200-385 days) and NZW/LacJ mice have a short one (113 +/- 2.8 days). (NZW X I/Ln)F1 hybrid mice had incubation times of 223 +/- 2.8 days indicating longer incubation times were dominant. Incubation periods in the backcross progeny of (NZW/LacJ X I/LnJ)F1 X NZW/LacJ segregated into two groups (64 mice, 130 +/- 1.1 d; 66 mice, 195 +/- 1.9 d) indicating single gene control. NZW/LacJ and 20 other inbred strains have the Prn-pa allele which is identified as a 3.8 kb Xbal fragment using a hamster PrP (prion protein) cDNA probe. I/LnJ and three other Prn-pb mouse strains have a 5.5 kb Xbal restriction fragment. Analysis of DNA from 66 backcross mice indicated Prn-i is tightly linked to Prn-p, the structural gene for PrP."
https://openalex.org/W2021735119,"A system was developed for the analysis of protein transport to the nucleus. Carrier proteins cross-linked to synthetic peptides were microinjected into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, and protein transport was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of fixed cells. A 13-mer synthetic peptide containing seven amino acids homologous to SV40 T antigen was capable of inducing nuclear transport, but no transport was observed when proteins were coupled with a synthetic peptide homologous to a nuclear-transport-defective T antigen. The largest protein-peptide conjugate efficiently transported was ferritin (Mr 465,000). The rate of transport was influenced by the number of peptides per molecule of carrier protein and, to some degree, by the size of the carrier protein. Transport of some conjugates was almost complete in 15 min at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2012456268,"Mammalian cell lines have been engineered to produce a secreted form of the AIDS retrovirus envelope glycoprotein. The recombinant protein has been isolated from growth-conditioned culture media and used to immunize animals. Antibodies directed against the recombinant molecule were found to react with the envelope glycoprotein produced in virus-infected cells. Furthermore, these antibodies were able to directly inactivate the AIDS retrovirus in a neutralization assay in vitro. The expression system reported here should provide sufficient quantities of the AIDS retrovirus envelope protein for biological and vaccination studies."
https://openalex.org/W1571926774,"Most cells contain two forms of the alpha subunit of the G protein (Gs) that stimulates adenylate cyclase; their apparent molecular weights are 45,000 and 52,000. Two cDNAs that correspond to distinct mRNAs for the alpha subunit of Gs have been cloned from a bovine adrenal library and sequenced. The sequences of the two cDNAs, designated pGs-l and pGs-S, are identical except for a single stretch of 46 nucleotides in the coding region, where four are altered and 42 are deleted in pGs-S. Expression of pGs-S and pGs-l in COS-m6 cells yields protein products with apparent molecular weights of 45,000 and 52,000, respectively, based on their mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. We conclude that pGs-S and pGs-l encode the 45- and 52-kDa forms of Gs alpha, respectively, and propose that the mRNAs encoding these proteins arise from a single gene by internal alternative RNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2085585711,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a lymphokine that plays a crucial role in the immune system, especially in the growth control of T lymphocytes. Expression of this lymphokine is restricted to activated T lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate the presence of unique DNA sequences in the 5' flanking region of the human IL-2 gene that control induced T-cell-specific gene expression. We also show that the DNA sequences function in an orientation-independent manner and activate a heterologous promoter which is otherwise inert in induced T cells. The DNA, which spans about 200 bp, contains regions with sequence homology to LTR sequences of HTLV-III (or LAV) and the 5' upstream region of the IL-2 receptor and interferon-gamma genes."
https://openalex.org/W1966155757,"The relationship of the copy numbers of the c-myc and N-myc oncogenes to tumor formation and progression was studied in small cell carcinoma of the lung. When 96 neoplastic lesions from 45 patients were examined, these lesions could be grouped into three categories: high copy (tumors with greater than 3 copies of the N-myc or c-myc gene per haploid genome), middle copy (1.5 to 3 copies per genome), and normal copy. Fourteen of the patients had middle copy tumors, but this was almost always a result of chromosome duplication rather than the amplification of a small genetic locus. In contrast, five patients had high copy tumors, with the increased copy number in each case due to gene amplification. The amplification did not occur in a heterogeneous fashion within individual patients, since all metastatic lesions from patients with high copy lung tumors were also high copy, while none of 41 metastatic lesions from the other patients were high copy. These data suggest that gene amplification is an important step in neoplastic growth in a subset of patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung and that this genetic event occurs relatively early (before metastasis) in this subset."
https://openalex.org/W2073006672,"Activated Harvey murine sarcoma virus ras genes were introduced into epidermal cells in vivo by direct application of retroviruses to mouse skin. Subsequent treatment with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced benign papillomas, some of which progressed to invasive carcinomas. Initiation with virus was irreversible for at least 4 months, since TPA treatment after this latency period produced papillomas within 4 weeks. Analysis of viral integration sites showed that carcinomas are clonal in origin. Both papillomas and carcinomas express virus-specific ras mRNA and the viral form of ras P21 protein. The results show that activated ras genes can replace chemical carcinogens in initiation of mouse skin carcinogenesis. This system presents a novel approach to in vivo analysis of the biological role of oncogenes in epithelial tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2003403192,"A variant of human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) is described that replicates but does not kill normal human T cells in vitro. This variant, designated X10-1, was derived from the genome of a cytopathic HTLV-III clone (pHXB2D) by excision of a 200-base pair segment in the 3′ region of the virus, spanning the env and 3′-orf genes. Comparable variants with 55 to 109 base pairs deleted exclusively in 3′-orf produced, in contrast, virus that was extremely cytopathic. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that the 3′-orf gene is not required for cytopathogenicity or replication of HTLV-III. In addition, the results suggest that virus replication and cytotoxicity are not intrinsically coupled. Furthermore, since clone X10-1 retains the ability to trans-activate genes linked to the viral long terminal repeats, trans-activation per se is not responsible for T-cell killing by HTLV-III. These results also raise the possibility that the carboxyl terminus of the envelope gene of HTLV-III has a direct role in T-cell killing by this virus."
https://openalex.org/W2077249735,"Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells grown on polycarbonate filters in a two-chamber culture system were used to study the postsynthetic sorting of the alpha-subunit of the (Na+,K+)ATPase, an important native protein of the MDCK cell basolateral plasmalemmal domains. The N-azidobenzoyl derivative of ouabain (NAB-ouabain) and anti-ouabain antibodies were used in pulse labeling experiments to monitor the arrival of newly synthesized molecules of (Na+,K+)ATPase at the apical and basolateral cell surfaces. The results show that newly synthesized alpha-subunits bind NAB-ouabain and become substrates for immunoprecipitation only when this compound is present in the basolateral chamber. No more than 10% of the (Na+,K+)ATPase synthesized during the pulse period could appear at the apical surface without being detected by our assay. Thus, sorting of this native protein is effected intracellularly prior to its direct insertion into the basolateral plasmalemmal domain. Passage through an acidic compartment is not required for proper sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2081881255,Bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) contains two independent transforming genes that have been mapped to the E5 and E6 open reading frames (ORF's). The E5 transforming protein was identified by means of an antiserum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 20 COOH-terminal amino acids of the E5 ORF. The E5 polypeptide is the smallest viral transforming protein yet characterized; it had an apparent size of 7 kilodaltons. The transforming polypeptide is encoded entirely within the second half of the E5 ORF and its predicted amino acid composition is very unusual; 68% of the amino acids are strongly hydrophobic and 34% are leucine. Cell fractionation studies localized this polypeptide predominantly to cellular membranes.
https://openalex.org/W1595993539,"While the binding of adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (App(NH)p) to Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II induces a double-stranded DNA passage reaction, its nonhydrolyzable beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate bond prevents enzyme turnover (Osheroff, N., Shelton, E. R., and Brutlag, D. L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9536-9543). Therefore, this ATP analog was used to characterize the interactions between Drosophila topoisomerase II and DNA which occur after DNA strand passage but before enzyme turnover. In the presence of App(NH)p, a stable post-strand passage topoisomerase II-nucleic acid complex is formed when circular DNA substrates are employed. Although noncovalent in nature, these complexes are resistant to increases in ionic strength and show less than 5% dissociation under salt concentrations (greater than 500 mM) that disrupt 95% of the enzyme-DNA interactions formed in the absence of App(NH)p or under a variety of other conditions that do not support DNA strand passage. These results strongly suggest that the process of enzyme turnover not only regenerates the active conformation of topoisomerase II but also confers upon the enzyme the ability to disengage from its nucleic acid product. Experiments with linear DNA molecules indicate that after strand passage has taken place, topoisomerase II may be able to travel along its DNA substrate by a linear diffusion process that is independent of enzyme turnover. Further studies demonstrate that the regeneration of the enzyme's catalytic center does not require enzyme turnover, since topoisomerase II can cleave double-stranded DNA substrates after strand passage has taken place. Finally, while the 2'-OH and 3'-OH of ATP are important for its interaction with Drosophila topoisomerase II, neither are required for turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1975844203,"The peptide pheromone, alpha-factor, was found to elicit down regulation of receptor sites on yeast a cell targets. Cellular uptake of alpha-factor accompanied the loss of receptor sites. Receptor-deficient a cells bearing a deletion of the STE2 gene were unable to internalize alpha-factor. Cultures were found to reaccumulate receptor sites following the initial period of down regulation; reaccumulation was dependent upon protein synthesis. Pheromone-resistant mutants, ste4-3 and ste5-3, retained the ability to down regulate receptors but failed to show reaccumulation. Our results suggest that alpha-factor-receptor complexes enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and that receptors are continuously lost and resynthesized in the presence of alpha-factor. We found no reduction of alpha-factor binding capacity in a cell cultures that had adapted to alpha-factor."

https://openalex.org/W1563758157,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors purified from porcine brain were reconstituted with two kinds of GTP-binding proteins (Gi and Go). The binding of agonists was affected by guanine nucleotides when the receptor was reconstituted with either Gi or Go, but not in the absence of one of the GTP-binding proteins. The displacement curves with agonists for the [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate [( 3H]QNB) binding were explained by assuming there are two sites with different affinities for a given agonist. The proportion of the high affinity site increased with increasing concentrations of the GTP-binding proteins, and the maximum value represented 50-70% of the total [3H]QNB-binding sites. Reconstitution of the receptor with both Gi and Go did not increase the proportion any further. These results indicate that Gi and Go interact with the same site, which rules out the possibility that there are two kinds of muscarinic receptors, one interacting with Gi and the other with Go. GDP as well as GTP decreased the affinity for the agonists of the muscarinic receptors reconstituted with Gi or Go. The conversion of GDP to GTP during the incubation was less than 1%, indicating that the effect of GDP is not due to its conversion to GTP, and that the binding of either GTP or GDP with the GTP-binding proteins suppresses their interaction with the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2028796198,"A human complementary DNA whose protein product is considered to be the major component of scrapie-associated fibrils in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome has been identified and characterized. The extensive homology of this gene sequence to the hamster PrP 27- to 30-kilodalton prion protein complementary DNA clone, and its existence as a single copy in the human genome, leads to the conclusion that this is the human prion gene. This human prion gene has been mapped to human chromosome 20, negating a direct link between the prion protein and Down's syndrome or the amyloid of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1530115081,"The levels of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase expression during muscle development and in response to modulation of demand for ion transport were studied in chick skeletal muscle cells in culture. The number of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase molecules on the myogenic cell surface, quantified with 125I-labeled monoclonal antibodies, increased 20-fold during muscle differentiation, with a substantial increase in (Na+ + K+)-ATPase molecules/unit area of membrane. The demand for sodium ion transport by the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was modulated by activating voltage-sensitive sodium channels with veratridine or exposing cultures to low [K+]o (0.5 mM). Exposure to veratridine (10 microM) resulted in a 60-100% increase in cell surface and a smaller increase in intracellular (Na+ + K+)-ATPase over a 24-36-h period. Neither high [K+]o (50 mM) nor Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 microM) produced any such change, suggesting that neither membrane depolarization nor elevated cytosolic calcium was mediating the effect of veratridine. Veratridine stimulated up-regulation was specific for the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, blocked by tetrodotoxin, and completely reversible. The kinetics of the reversal (down-regulation) process were much faster (t1/2 = 3 h) than those of up-regulation (t1/2 = 18 h). Up-regulation of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase by veratridine occurred by a combination of two mechanisms: the first an early phase involving a stimulated biosynthesis of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and a later phase in which the biosynthetic rate returned to approximately control levels while the degradation rate slowed (t1/2 control = 31 h, t1/2 veratridine = 64 h)."
https://openalex.org/W2065998260,"The myb gene is the transforming oncogene of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV); its normal cellular homolog, c-myb, is conserved across a broad span of evolution. In humans, c-myb is expressed in malignant hematopoietic cell lines and in primary hematopoietic tumors. Partial complementary DNA clones were generated from blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The sequences of the clones were compared to the c-myb of other species, as well as the v-myb of AMV. In addition, the carboxyl terminal region of human c-myb was placed in an expression vector to obtain protein for the generation of antiserum, which was used to identify the human c-myb gene product. Like v-myb, this protein was found within the nucleus of leukemic cells where it was associated with the nuclear matrix. These studies provide further evidence that c-myb might be involved in human leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1976057490,"The nucleotide sequence for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene TOP2, which encodes DNA topoisomerase II, was compared with the sequence for bacterial DNA gyrase. The amino and carboxyl terminal halves of the single-subunit yeast enzyme showed homologies with the B and A subunits of bacterial gyrase, respectively, at corresponding positions along the polypeptide chains. Although the two enzymes differ in both quaternary structure and activity, the homology between the two proteins indicates mechanistic as well as structural similarities, and a probable evolutionary relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2159967497,"The nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (GMP-PNP) produced an ATP-dependent but Ca2+-independent stimulation of [3H]norepinephrine release from permeabilized chromaffin cells. This stimulation of secretion was 25-35% of the secretion induced by 10 microM Ca2+. A similar Ca2+-independent stimulation was produced by other non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues. No effect was seen with a variety of other nucleotides, including GTP. The GMP-PNP effect was specifically inhibited by low concentrations of guanine nucleotides. Addition of cAMP did not mimic the Ca2+-independent GMP-PNP effect, but did slightly enhance Ca2+-dependent secretion. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin had no effect on Ca2+-dependent secretion or on the GMP-PNP effect. There was no detectable diglyceride or inositol phosphate produced during GMP-PNP treatment, and addition of diglyceride and inositol trisphosphate did not induce secretion. Guanosine 5'-(beta-thio)diphosphate (GDP-beta-S), in addition to its ability to inhibit the GMP-PNP effect, partially inhibited Ca2+-dependent secretion. At 10 microM free Ca2+, the effects of GMP-PNP and Ca2+ were nonadditive. In fact, secretion in the presence of both GMP-PNP and 10 microM Ca2+ was slightly less than secretion due to Ca2+ alone. These data suggest that a guanine nucleotide-dependent process interacts in some way with one or more components of the normal Ca2+-dependent secretory pathway. However, it may not be an intrinsic part of the mechanism underlying Ca2+-dependent secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1489538734,"Peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chloride (Cl-) and thiocyanate (SCN-) was studied using neutrophils from human blood and eosinophils and macrophages from rat peritoneal exudates. The aims were to determine whether Cl- or SCN- is preferentially oxidized and whether leukocytes oxidize SCN- to the antimicrobial oxidizing agent hypothiocyanite (OSCN-). Stimulated neutrophils produced H2O2 and secreted myeloperoxidase. Under conditions similar to those in plasma (0.14 M Cl-, 0.02-0.12 mM SCN-), myeloperoxidase catalyzed the oxidation of Cl- to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which reacted with ammonia and amines to yield chloramines. HOCl and chloramines reacted with SCN- to yield products without oxidizing activity, so that high SCN- blocked accumulation of chloramines in the extracellular medium. Under conditions similar to those in saliva and the surface of the oral mucosa (20 mM Cl-, 0.1-3 mM SCN-), myeloperoxidase catalyzed the oxidation of SCN- to OSCN-, which accumulated in the medium to concentrations of up to 40-70 microM. Sulfonamide compounds increased the yield of stable oxidants to 0.2-0.3 mM by reacting with OSCN- to yield derivatives analogous to chloramines. Stimulated eosinophils produced H2O2 and secreted eosinophil peroxidase, which catalyzed the oxidation of SCN- to OSCN- regardless of Cl- concentration. Stimulated macrophages produced H2O2 but had low peroxidase activity. OSCN- was produced when SCN- was 0.1 mM or higher and myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, or lactoperoxidase was added. The results indicate that SCN- rather than Cl- may be the physiologic substrate (electron donor) for eosinophil peroxidase and that OSCN- may contribute to leukocyte antimicrobial activity under conditions that favor oxidation of SCN- rather than Cl-."
https://openalex.org/W1492111898,"Transcription of the gene for cytosolic Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) from rat liver is increased by cAMP and glucocorticoids and decreased by insulin. A PEPCK-thymidine kinase (TK) chimeric gene was transfected into FTO-2B rat hepatoma cells, which were TK-deficient. Previous studies showed that a cAMP regulatory element is located at the 5' end of the PEPCK gene. In this report, we demonstrate that the 5' end of the gene also contains a glucocorticoid regulatory element, but not one for insulin. Regions of the PEPCK gene that contain these regulatory elements were attached to the Herpes simplex virus TK structural gene containing its own promoter. The hormone regulatory elements within the 5' flanking region of the PEPCK gene conferred cAMP and glucocorticoid responsiveness on the TK gene after transfection into FTO-2B cells. Like viral enhancer elements, these regulatory elements functioned properly when placed in either orientation at various positions 5' or 3' to TK. The presence of the SV40 enhancer element upstream from the PEPCK-TK gene had little effect on the basal level of expression or hormonal regulation of the chimeric gene."

https://openalex.org/W1604985295,"Recent studies have shown that hepatic mRNAS14 responds rapidly to thyroid hormone administration. Moreover, this mRNA is known to increase in mass with the administration of a high carbohydrate fat-free diet. Therefore, it appears to share many of the same properties of the known hepatic lipogenic enzymes. Because the lipogenic enzymes display a synergistic interaction between thyroid hormones and carbohydrates, we investigated the kinetics of response of mRNAS14 to carbohydrate feeding, as well as its interaction with triiodothyronine (T3). We found that mRNAS14 responds rapidly to the dietary administration of sucrose in euthyroid rats, with a 2-fold increase within 30 min, and a 25-fold increase by 4 h. On the other hand, when given to hypothyroid rats, sucrose ultimately lead to only a 2-3-fold increase in the level of mRNAS14, attaining a level less than that found in starved euthyroid rats. The diminished response of mRNAS14 to sucrose in hypothyroidism could not be enhanced by insulin administration. However, administration of replacement doses of T3 (400 ng/100 g of body weight) immediately restored the rapid response to sucrose feeding. The response of sucrose and T3 was synergistic. Dose-response studies with T3 indicated that the rapid interaction between T3 and sucrose was limited by the occupancy of the T3 nuclear receptor. A similar synergistic response to T3 and glucose was noted in primary hepatocyte cultures, thus indicating that the synergism between these two stimuli is not due to changes in extrahepatic hormones or metabolites. Our data are most consistent with the hypothesis that the T3-nuclear receptor complex multiplies a signal generated by carbohydrate metabolism to induce hepatic mRNAS14. The interaction does not appear to require the preliminary induction of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes and their mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1482991332,"Ubiquitin (Ub) carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (E) catalyzes the hydrolysis, at the Ub-carboxyl terminus, of a wide variety of C-terminal derivatives. We show that the enzyme is inactivated by millimolar concentrations of either sodium borohydride or hydroxylamine, but only if is present. We have interpreted these results on the assumption that the hydrolase mechanism is one of nucleophilic catalysis with an acyl-Ub-E intermediate. The borohydride-inactivated enzyme has the following properties. It is a stoichiometric complex of E and containing tritium from sodium boro[3H]hydride. This complex is stable at neutral pH in 5 M urea and can be isolated on the basis of size on a sieving column, but a labeled product the size of is released under more strongly denaturing conditions. The Ub released in acid is Ub-carboxyl-terminal aldehyde, based on the observations that: it contains the tritium present in the reduced complex and it is able to form the inactive enzyme from a stoichiometric amount of fresh enzyme, and inactivation is accompanied by E-Ub adduct formation; it has chemical properties expected of an aldehyde: after a second reduction of the released with boro[3H]hydride and complete acid hydrolysis, tritium counts are found in ethanolamine (the carboxyl-terminal residue of is glycine). These results suggest that enzyme and combine in an equilibrium reaction to form an ester or thiol ester adduct (at the Ub-carboxyl terminus), and that this adduct is trapped by borohydride to give a very stable inactive E-Ub (thio) hemiacetal which is unable to undergo a second reduction step and which can release Ub-aldehyde in mild acid. Inactivation in the presence of hydroxylamine of hydrolase occurs once during hydrolysis of 1200 molecules of Ub-hydroxamate by the enzyme. The hydrolysis/inactivation ratio is constant over the range of 10-50 mM hydroxylamine showing that forms of E-Ub with which hydroxylamine and water react are different and not in rapid equilibrium. The inactive enzyme may be an acylhydroxamate formed from an E-Ub mixed anhydride generated from the E-Ub (thiol) ester inferred from the borohydride study. A direct radioactive assay for the hydrolase has been developed using the Ub-C-terminal amide of [3H]butanol-4-amine as substrate."

Southern analysis of human genomic DNA shows that its gene is present as a single copy in the human genome, and Northern analysis demonstrates the presence of a single size species of mRNA in erythroid and non-erythroid tissues and in several cultured cell lines. We have also demonstrated that the level of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase mRNA is markedly increased in tissues or cell lines of erythroid origin and that this is due to a tissue-specific transcriptional activation of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase gene."

https://openalex.org/W1533303009,"Effects of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) on cytoplasmic free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]c, have been measured in adrenal glomerulosa cells using a calcium-sensitive photoprotein, aequorin. ACTH causes a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]c. Dose response study demonstrates that 1 pM ACTH induces an elevation of [Ca2+]c and that effect of ACTH appears to be saturated at 100 pM. ACTH action is greatly inhibited but not abolished by removal of extracellular calcium and is completely blocked in medium containing no added calcium and 1 mM EGTA. Under similar conditions, angiotensin II induces a remarkable rise in [Ca2+]c. ACTH action is not affected by pretreatment with dantrolene, which considerably decreases angiotensin II action on [Ca2+]c. One micromolar forskolin, which mimics 1 nM ACTH-mediated elevation of intracellular cAMP, does not increase [Ca2+]c nor modulates changes in [Ca2+] induced by a low dose of ACTH. One hundred micromolar forskolin or 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP, however, increases [Ca2+]c even in calcium-free medium containing 1 mM EGTA. When glomerulosa cells are co-loaded with aequorin and quin2, angiotensin II-induced change in aequorin signal is greatly reduced, and ACTH-induced change is abolished. Quin2 loading results in accumulation of calcium in the cell under both unstimulated and stimulated conditions. These results indicate that ACTH increases [Ca2+]c by cAMP-independent mechanism, that ACTH action on [Ca2+]c is exclusively dependent on extracellular calcium, and that quin2 is unable to detect the rapid change in [Ca2+]c because of its calcium chelating activity."
https://openalex.org/W1566890604,"The reactions of cytochrome b561 with other redox-active components of the adrenal chromaffin granule were examined using optical difference spectroscopy. It was shown that there is no direct electron transfer between the cytochrome and dopamine beta-hydroxylase, but that in the presence of ascorbate, turnover of dopamine beta-hydroxylase causes an oxidation of the cytochrome, which is partially reversed by the action of the mitochondrial NADH:A-. oxidoreductase. Thus, these three proteins may be functionally coupled via ascorbate. A quantitative study of the relationship between the redox state of the cytochrome and the ascorbate radical concentration measured by EPR showed that ascorbate reduces the cytochrome in a one-electron transfer reaction. Generation of a proton electrochemical gradient across the granule membrane causes only a small (20 mV) increase in the cytochrome midpoint potential suggesting the cytochrome is not a proton pump. The data are consistent with a model in which cytochrome b561, by reacting with ascorbate or ascorbate free radical on either side of the granule membrane, could couple the ascorbate-consuming reaction of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase inside the chromaffin granule to the ascorbate-regenerating reaction of the NADH:A-. oxidoreductase on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The H+-ATPase of the granule membrane could both drive the flow of electrons in the direction from cytosol to granule and replenish protons consumed by the turnover of dopamine beta-hydroxylase inside the granule."

These plasmids could be rescued in E. coli by transfection. Integrated forms could be detected neither in somatic tissues, nor in spermatozoa. Efficiency of paternal or maternal transmission was close to 100%. The plasmids had lost or had extensively rearranged the polyoma sequences. In addition, they had acquired defined segments of genomic mouse DNA, which might be responsible for correct segregation of daughter copies at both mitosis and meiosis (centromeric function)."
https://openalex.org/W1572781346,"Abstract Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), like numerous other Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, has been found to stimulate polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in responsive cells. The present studies further clarify the mechanism of action of this peptide hormone by demonstrating direct in vitro effects of TRH on polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in GH3 pituitary cell membranes. Membranes from [3H]myoinositol-labeled cells were found to generate inositol bis- and tris- but not monophosphate upon incubation. Inositol polyphosphate generation was stimulated 2-3-fold by nanomolar concentrations of TRH in a reaction which was potentiated by micromolar concentrations of GTP; hormone-stimulated hydrolysis observed in the absence of GTP was fully antagonized by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), Ca2+, and sodium fluoride also activated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in vitro. Stimulated inositol polyphosphate generation was accompanied by stimulated 1,2-diacylglycerol formation. Evidence that both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as well as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate served as substrates for the activated phosphoinositide phosphodiesterase is presented. Pretreatment of GH3 cells with cholera or pertussis toxin did not influence stimulated hydrolysis in membranes. It is concluded that the TRH receptor directly regulates polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in GH3 cell plasma membranes by a GTP-dependent process. The GTP dependence does not appear to be mediated through a cholera or pertussis toxin substrate and may involve a novel GTP-binding protein (NP)."
https://openalex.org/W1588459571,"The possible role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor phosphorylation at threonine 654 in modulating the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of EGF-treated A431 cells has been studied. It has been suggested that EGF could indirectly activate a protein-serine/threonine kinase, protein kinase C, that can phosphorylate the EGF receptor at threonine 654. Protein kinase C is known to be activated, and threonine 654 is phosphorylated, when A431 cells are exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The protein-tyrosine kinase activity of EGF receptors is normally evidenced in EGF-treated cells by phosphorylation of the receptor at tyrosine. This is inhibited when TPA-treated cells are exposed to EGF. We now show that receptor phosphorylation at threonine 654 can also be detected in EGF-treated A431 cells, presumably due to indirect stimulation of protein kinase C or a similar kinase. Some receptor molecules are phosphorylated both at threonine 654 and at tyrosine. Since prior phosphorylation at threonine 654 inhibits autophosphorylation, we propose that protein kinase C can phosphorylate the threonine 654 of autophosphorylated receptors. This provides evidence for models in which protein kinase C activation, consequent upon EGF binding, could reduce the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor. Indeed, we find that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, added 10 min after EGF, further increases threonine 654 phosphorylation and induces the loss of tyrosine phosphate from A431 cell EGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1542340245,"The Z genetic variant of human alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) is associated with decreased serum alpha 1AT levels, hepatic inclusion bodies, and an increased risk of lung and liver disease. We studied the biosynthesis, processing, and secretion of normal and Z variant alpha 1AT in cell-free translation systems, reconstituted in vitro processing systems, and in the Xenopus oocyte secretory system. Human liver mRNA was prepared from normal subjects (PiMM) and from individuals homozygous for alpha 1AT deficiency (PiZZ). Cell-free translation resulted in the synthesis of 49,000-Da preproteins with a 23-amino acid signal sequence. The genetic variants were synthesized at comparable levels and could be distinguished on the basis of charge. The majority of the amino acids in the ZZ signal peptide were identified and found to be the same as those comprising the MM signal sequence. These proteins were co-translationally processed with similar efficiency by dog pancreas microsomes, producing 52,000-Da glycoproteins which were completely translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. When the human liver RNA preparations were injected into Xenopus oocytes, both of the alpha 1AT variants were synthesized intracellularly and alpha 1AT was detected in the medium of all oocytes injected with MM RNA. However, the Z variant accumulated within the microsomal vesicles of the cell and was undetectable or present at decreased levels in the medium. We conclude that the single amino acid substitution in the Z variant of alpha 1AT does not affect its synthesis or co-translational processing but that it strongly affects its transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1583321574,"A two-compartment electron paramagnetic resonance system has been developed in which the membrane-impermeable spin probe Ni(en)2+3 is used to selectively eliminate the EPR signal from extravesicular ascorbate radical, such that radicals in intra- and extravesicular compartments can be distinguished. Using this system, we have shown that an increase in ascorbate radical in the extravesicular medium is reflected by an increase in ascorbate radical within resealed chromaffin granule ghosts containing trapped ascorbate but has no effect on radical concentrations inside liposomes containing ascorbate. This indicates that the chromaffin granule membrane contains a component, not present in liposomes, that allows equilibration between the intra- and extravesicular ascorbate/ascorbate radical couples. This component is probably cytochrome b561. We further show that activation of the mitochondrial NADH:ascorbate radical oxidoreductase in the extravesicular medium causes a decrease in intravesicular ascorbate radical in chromaffin granule ghosts but not in liposomes. These data provide direct experimental evidence for the hypothesis that the adrenal medullary mitochondrial NADH:ascorbate radical oxidoreductase could drive the re-reduction of ascorbate free radical generated inside the chromaffin granule by the turnover of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, without the ascorbate radical ever having to leave the granule."
https://openalex.org/W170459508,"Four Ca2+-dependent proteinase activities in lobster claw and abdominal muscle have been resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography on gel filtration and ion-exchange columns. These activities, which do not appear to be generated by autolytic or other degradative processes, differed from each other in molecular weight (peak I, Mr = 310,000; peak IIa, Mr = 125,000; peak IIb, Mr = 195,000; peak III, Mr = 59,000) and net charge, as indicated by elution from an ion-exchange column with a NaCl gradient. Although optimum activity occurred at 5-10 mM Ca2+ at pH 6.8, the enzymes differed in activation at lower Ca2+ concentrations. The concentrations required for half-maximal activation were 0.6 mM for peak III, 1 mM for peak I, 1.5 mM for peak IIa, and 2 mM for peak IIb. Only the peak III proteinase was active at 100 microM Ca2+; none were active at 10 microM and below. Although the lobster Ca2+-dependent proteinases were all inhibited, from 75 to 98%, by the cysteine proteinase inhibitors leupeptin, N-[N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]agmatine, and iodoacetamide, they showed differential responses to the aspartic proteinase inhibitor pepstatin and the serine proteinase inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Peak I was moderately (26%) inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, whereas peaks IIb and III were inhibited 26 and 90%, respectively, by pepstatin. This is the first description of multiple forms of Ca2+-dependent proteinase that require Ca2+ at millimolar levels in any tissue, either vertebrate or invertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W1587432241,"Canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles contain intrinsic phospholamban protein phosphatase activity, which is also effective in dephosphorylating phosphorylase a. The phosphatase associated with sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes was solubilized with Triton X-100 and subjected to chromatography on Mono Q HR 5/5 and polylysine-agarose. A single peak of phosphatase activity was eluted from each column and it was coincident for both phospholamban and phosphorylase a, used as substrates. Thermal denaturation of the enzyme resulted in progressive and coincident loss of both phospholamban and phosphorylase a phosphatase activities. Enzymic activity was partially inhibited by protein phosphatase inhibitor 1. Migration of the enzyme during sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation corresponded to a globular protein with an apparent Mr of 46,000. This enzyme preparation could dephosphorylate both the calcium-calmodulin-dependent as well as the cAMP-dependent sites on phospholamban. Thus, dephosphorylation of phospholamban by this sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated phosphatase may participate in modulating sarcoplasmic reticulum function in cardiac muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1560206692,"Murine immune interferon (Mu-IFN-gamma) can be radiolabeled with [gamma-32P]ATP by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The resulting 32P-labeled Mu-IFN-gamma (32P-Mu-IFN-gamma) with high radiological specific activity (60-260 muCi/micrograms) retains biological activity. Acid hydrolysis of 32P-Mu-IFN-gamma or 32P-labeled human IFN-gamma leads to the release of [32P]phosphoserine but not phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine. With 32P-Mu-IFN-gamma, we have demonstrated that there are 5 X 10(3) to 1.5 X 10(4) receptors per-cell on several murine cell lines of diverse origin and that the Kd at 24 degrees C for these cells is in the range of 1 X 10(-10) to 1 X 10(-9) M. Covalent binding of 32P-Mu-IFN-gamma to its receptor results in the formation of several specific high-molecular weight products, the major one of which has an apparent molecular weight of 90,000-100,000. If this represents a 1:1 complex of Mu-IFN-gamma and its receptor (or its binding subunit), the murine interferon gamma receptor has a molecular weight of 75,000-85,000."
https://openalex.org/W82303313,"We previously determined the binding constants of ADP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) to acto . myosin subfragment 1 (acto X S-1) by measuring the dissociation of acto X S-1 as a function of ATP analog concentration (Greene, L.E., and Eisenberg, E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 543-548). In the present study, we reinvestigated this question by measuring the extent to which these ATP analogs inhibit the acto X S-1 ATPase activity using both cross-linked actin X S-1 and non-cross-linked proteins. No significant difference was found between the cross-linked and non-cross-linked acto X S-1 complexes in their affinity for either ADP or AMP-PNP. The binding constant of ADP to acto X S-1 determined by the inhibition method was in excellent agreement with that obtained previously by the dissociation method, both techniques giving values of about 7 X 10(3) M-1. However, this was not the case for AMP-PNP and PPi, with the inhibition method giving about 10-fold weaker binding constants than those determined previously by the dissociation method. Upon redoing our dissociation experiments over a wider range of actin concentrations than we used previously, we now find that the dissociation method gives much weaker values for the binding constants of PPi and AMP-PNP to acto X S-1, i.e. values on the order of 4 X 10(2) M-1. The very weak binding of these ATP analogs to acto X S-1 makes it difficult to obtain these values with great accuracy. Nevertheless, they seem to be in good agreement with the binding constants determined by the inhibition method. The weak binding of AMP-PNP and PPi to acto X S-1 is consistent with the recent fiber studies of Pate and Cooke (Pate, E., and Cooke, R. (1985) Biophys. J. 47, 773-780) and Schoenberg and Eisenberg (Schoenberg, M., and Eisenberg, E. (1986) Biophys. J. 48, 863-872)."
https://openalex.org/W1598344648,"The effect of insulin on 32Pi incorporation into phospholipids in various subcellular sites of isolated rat hepatocytes was investigated. After labeling the phospholipids of hepatocytes from rats previously starved for 24 h with 32Pi (10 mu Ci/10(6) cells) for 90 min, either saline or insulin (32 nM) was added. Following incubations of 1, 5, and 30 min, chilled cells were rapidly washed, homogenized in the presence of inhibitors of phospholipid degradation, and fractionated into the major subcellular organelles. Phospholipids were extracted from plasma membranes, microsomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and nuclei with acidic chloroform:methanol. The aqueous deacylation products were separated by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography, and the 32Pi incorporated into all the major diacylglycerophospholipids was determined. In parallel experiments, the specific radioactivity of 32Pi and [gamma-32P]ATP was determined. The results revealed that insulin had no effect on the turnover of the major phospholipids, including the polyphosphoinositides, of all subcellular compartments analyzed relative to the control. In addition, there were no significant differences in the amount and 32P labeling of cellular orthophosphate between saline- and insulin-treated cells. The specific radioactivity of [gamma-32P]ATP was increased by 20% after 30-min treatment with insulin, requiring appropriate correction of 32P-labeled phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for estimation of mass changes at near steady-state labeling of cellular ATP."
https://openalex.org/W92205067,"Using sequential DNA-mediated gene transfer, a mouse DNA sequence (ouaR) that confers resistance to the cytotoxic effects of ouabain in cultured cells was recently isolated. To determine the basis of this resistance, we examined the ouabain-resistant phenotype of cells from each stage of the transfers that led to isolation of the ouaR gene, as well as the recipient of the isolated gene. Membranes prepared from the original DNA donor, the two intermediate stages of the sequential gene transfer, and the final isolated gene recipient contained at least two functionally distinct forms of the Na,K-ATPase. In addition to a form indistinguishable in ouabain affinity from that in the parental lines, these ouabain-resistant cells contained a form characterized by a low affinity for the glycoside. That the low-affinity form contributed to ouabain resistance was suggested by the correlation between its relative abundance and the ability to limit the increase in intracellular Na+ content when exposed to ouabain. Maintenance of the final recipient of the isolated ouaR gene for 24 h in 10 microM ouabain had no effect on the specific activity of the resistant form of the Na,K-ATPase, implying that the low-affinity form was not uniquely inducible by ouabain. These results suggest that the ouabain-resistant phenotype conferred by ouaR is attributable to expression of a Na,K-ATPase with a low affinity for the glycoside."
https://openalex.org/W1517315993,"The quaternary structural relationships between subunits of the follitropin (FSH) receptor were determined through the use of the reversible, homobifunctional, chemical cross-linking reagent bis[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone (BSOCOES) after formation of covalent 125I-azidobenzoyl-FSH-receptor subunit complexes by photoaffinity labeling. This experimental approach resulted in the formation of high molecular mass complexes (116, 172, and 320 kDa) as detected by autoradiography. After reversal of the BSOCOES cross-links, a second-dimension sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of these complexes demonstrated that two lower molecular mass complexes, 64 and 84 kDa, identified previously as specific components of the FSH receptor by photoaffinity labeling alone (Smith, R. A., Branca, A. A., and Reichert, L. E., Jr. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14297-14303) were contained within the 116- and 172-kDa complexes. In addition, the 116-kDa complex was not found to be a component of the 172-kDa complex. Since the high molecular weight complexes have molecular weights large enough to contain additional unlabeled proteins, these data indicate the possibility that there are several distinct FSH receptor subunits. Furthermore, the observation of the 320-kDa band, taken together with the observed structural relationships, suggests that the FSH receptor may contain two each of three distinct subunits with approximate molecular weights of 32,000, 48,000, and 86,000, respectively."
