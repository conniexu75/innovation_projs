Attachment of Ras proteins to the plasma membrane is required for effective Ras signaling and is initiated by the enzyme farnesyl protein transferase. We found that in the presence of potent farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors, Ras proteins in the human colon carcinoma cell line DLD-1 were alternatively prenylated by geranylgeranyl transferase-1. When H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B were expressed individually in COS cells, H-Ras prenylation and membrane association were found to be uniquely sensitive to farnesyl transferase inhibitors; N- and K-Ras proteins incorporated the geranylgeranyl isoprene group and remained associated with the membrane fraction. The alternative prenylation of N- and K-Ras has significant implications for our understanding of the mechanism of action of farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors as anti-cancer chemotherapeutics.

Newly synthesized Ras proteins are partitioned to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane by a series of post-translational modifications. The first step, catalyzed by the enzyme farnesyl protein transferase, is the addition of the 15- carbon isoprenyl group farnesyl to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine in the Ras carboxyl-terminal CAAX box (where C is cysteine, A is aliphatic, andX is typically Met or Ser) (1Casey P.J.

Farnesylation is followed by proteolytic removal of the AAX amino acids and methylation of the carboxyl group of the farnesylated cysteine (4Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). Ras proteins at the plasma membrane cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. Mutations that stabilize the active GTP-bound state have been identified in over 30% of human tumors, with particularly high incidences in pancreatic (∼90%) and colon (∼50%) cancers. Four oncogenic Ras proteins have been described, H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B. The majority of mutations associated with human cancer have been found in the K-Ras gene. The two K-Ras proteins are products of a single alternatively spliced transcript, with K-Ras4B the predominant isoform (>80%) (5Bos J.L. Mutat.

Ras proteins that have been genetically modified so that they lack the isoprenylated cysteine do not associate with the plasma membrane and cannot transform fibroblasts (7Kato K. Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M.

These genetic experiments provided the basis for the development of farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) 1The abbreviations used areFTIfarnesyl protein transferase inhibitor;PCRpolymerase chain reaction;DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium;HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. as anti-cancer agents. A number of reports have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase by CAAX analogs reduces anchorage-independent growth of Ras-transformed cells in soft agar (8Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar) and slows growth of Ras-transformed cells in nude mice (9Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms S.J.

A. 1994; 91: 9141-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The FTIs appear relatively non-toxic in that they do not interfere with normal cell proliferation (11James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result was somewhat surprising because Ras function was shown to be necessary for normal growth factor signaling and cell proliferation (12Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). A mechanism through which cells may proliferate in the presence of FTIs was suggested by the observation that, in vitro, the K-Ras4B protein, but not H-Ras, can act as a substrate for geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (13James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Geranylgeranyl transferase-1 adds the 20 carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenyl unit to the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif (14Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Geranylgeranyl transferase-1 substrate proteins generally have a carboxyl-terminal leucine (15Kinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). James et al. (16James G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4454-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) recently reported that a chimeric Ras protein consisting of the first 164 amino acids of H-RasV12 followed by the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids of K-Ras4B incorporates [3H]mevalonate in Rat-1 cells even in the presence of the peptidomimetic FTIs. The prenyl group attached to H/K-Ras4BV12 in this study was reported to be farnesyl, both in the absence and presence of the FTI. We report here that Ras proteins in the human cancer cell line DLD-1 become geranylgeranylated in the presence of farnesyl transferase inhibitors. Plasmids expressing H-, N-, and the two K-Ras isoforms were transfected into COS cells to determine the effects of FTI on the prenylation and membrane association of each isoform. farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor; polymerase chain reaction; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; high pressure liquid chromatography. [3H]mevalonolactone (40 Ci/mmol) in 100% ethanol at 1 mCi/ml was from DuPont NEN (NET-1075). It was dried under nitrogen to increase the concentration to 100 mCi/ml. G418 and trypsin-EDTA were from Life Technologies, Inc.; Amplify fluorographic reagent was from Amersham Life Science; Pefabloc SC was from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The pMev construct, which contains the coding sequence for the mevalonate transporter under control of a cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (17Kim C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23113-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was co-transfected with a neo-expressing plasmid (pCI-neo, Promega Corp.) into DLD-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) using Lipofectamine as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Control cells were transfected with pCI-neo alone. Neo-expressing colonies were selected in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum containing 800 μm G418 and maintained in 400 μm G418. Treatment of the parental line, control neo-resistant lines, and pMev transfectants with mevastatin alone (20 μm) resulted in complete cell killing within several days. In the presence of exogenous mevalonate (100 μm), several pMev-transfected clones were resistant to 20 μmmevastatin. In contrast, pCI-neo transfectants and the parental line were equally sensitive to mevastatin in the presence or absence of exogenous mevalonate. DLDpMev cells were incubated overnight (18 h) at 37 °C, 5% CO2with SCH 44342 or 56582 at 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10, and 20 μm, or with the farnesyl pyrophosphate antagonist, α-hydroxyfarnesyl-phosphonic acid (Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA), at 0, 0.08, 0.2, 0.7, 2.2, and 6.6 μm. The following morning, the cells were treated with fresh compound or vehicle control, mevastatin (20 μm, to block endogenous mevalonate synthesis), and [3H]mevalonolactone (40 Ci/mmol) at 100 μCi/ml. After 18 h of incubation, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 μm leupeptin, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm benzamide, 2 mm EDTA). Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated from approximately 20 million cpm of lysate in a 1-ml volume of RIPA buffer. Antibodies used were the pan-Ras antibody, Y13–259 (SC-35-agarose conjugate), or the K-Ras- (SC-30) or N-Ras- (SC-31) specific antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. To precipitate with Y13–259, 30 μl of agarose conjugate at 2 μg/μl was added to the lysate and rotated at 4 °C for 4 h. To precipitate with free antibody, 50 μl of SC-30 or SC-31 at 0.1 μg/μl was added and rotated at 4 °C for 3 h, and then 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Oncogene Science) resuspended in RIPA was added for 1 h with continued rotation. All prenyl analysis was done with Y13–259 immunoprecipitated Ras since SC-30 and SC-31 yielded insufficient labeled Ras for analysis. Total lysate (approximately 2 × 106 cpm) and immunoprecipitated Ras (100% of immunoprecipitate) were loaded on 18 × 18 cm 14% polyacrylamide gels and run at 30 mA for approximately 4 h. The gel was fixed in 25% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 15 min, immersed for 15 min in Amplify fluorographic reagent, dried, and exposed (Hyperfilm-MP, Amersham Life Science) for 1–30 days. Mutant (G12V) H-Ras cDNA was PCR amplified from human bladder carcinoma cell line T24 cDNA and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pSV-Sport (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mutant (G12V) K-Ras4B cDNA was PCR amplified from the human colon cancer line SW620 and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega Corp.). Mutant (Q61H) K-Ras4A was PCR amplified from HTB-177 cells and cloned into pCI-neo. Mutant (G12N) N-Ras coding sequence, a gift from A. Wolfman (The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH), was cloned into the pCI-neo vector. All PCR products were sequenced and were transforming in NIH 3T3 cells. COS-7 cells were co-transfected (Lipofectamine, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 15 μg each of pMEV and H-, N-, K-Ras4A, or K-Ras4B expression vector and incubated for 48 h in control DMEM medium or DMEM with 7.5 μm SCH-56582. For the final 18 h, cells were treated with [3H]mevalonolactone (40 Ci/mmol) at 100 μCi/ml and 20 μm mevastatin. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated with Y13–259-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Structural characterization of prenyl groups attached to immunoprecipitated proteins was performed as described (18Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was precipitated in acetone, washed twice with acetone to remove free lipids, and digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5% acetonitrile, and .04% w/v trypsin-EDTA. Cleavage of prenyl groups was initiated by addition of 0.1 volumes of methyl iodide in 3% formic acid. Released prenyl groups were extracted into chloroform:methanol (9:1), dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 100 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm phosphoric acid, and resolved on a C18 HPLC column (Waters 04698). COS-7 cells were transfected with mutant H-, N-, K-4A, K-4B, or H-Ras-CVLL expression vectors or vector control (pCI-neo) in the presence of 7.5 μm SCH 56582, 20 μmmevastatin (Sigma), or vehicle. Following transfection, cells were suspended in 0.9 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 4 mm benzamidine) and sonicated for 5 s. The cell debris was pelleted at 1500 × g for 4 min at 4 °C and discarded, and the supernatant was transferred to Beckman polyallomer tubes and spun at 46,000 rpm (100,000 ×g) for 45 min. The pellet was washed once with ice-cold hypotonic buffer with protease inhibitors, re-pelleted at 46,000 rpm for 15 min, and then resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold hypotonic buffer with protease inhibitors. The supernatant was concentrated in Microcon 10 concentrators (Amicon). Particulate and soluble samples (approximately 15–20% of total) were loaded on an 18 × 18 cm 14% polyacrylamide gel, run at 30 mA for approximately 4 h, and then transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Corp.). The filter was blocked for 30 min in 5% dried skim milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm sodium chloride) and incubated with primary antibody (SC-030 for K-Ras, SC-029 for H-Ras, SC-31 for N-Ras (Santa Cruz)) at 1 μg/ml in TBST plus 0.5% fetal calf serum for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-anti-rat IgG (Boehringer Mannheim, No. 605 190) was diluted 1:5000 in TBST plus 0.5% fetal calf serum and incubated with the filter for 1 h at room temperature. The chemiluminescent reaction was initiated with ECL Western blotting solution (Amersham Corp.), and the filter was wrapped in Saran wrap and exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Corp.). To examine the effects of farnesyl transferase inhibitors SCH 44342 and SCH 56582 (19Bishop W.R. Bond R. Petrin J. Wang L. Patton R. Doll R. Njoroge G. Catino J. Schwartz J. Windsor W. Syto R. Schwartz J. Carr D. James L. Kirschmeier P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30611-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) on the prenylation of endogenous Ras proteins in a human tumor-derived cell line, we introduced the mevalonate transporter (17Kim C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23113-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into DLD-1 cells. (DLD-1 cells are derived from a colon carcinoma and contain one normal K-Ras allele and one activated mutant K-Ras allele. Genetic disruption of the mutant allele causes altered morphology, loss of capacity to grow in soft agar, and reduced tumorigenesis in nude mice (20Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar)). Expression of the mevalonate transporter in the clonal DLD-1 cell line DLDpMev allows the cells to efficiently utilize exogenous [3H]mevalonate in the synthesis of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Proteins labeled in DLDpMev cells following incubation in 100 μCi/ml [3H]mevalonate, 20 μmmevastatin, and various concentrations of farnesyl transferase inhibitor were visualized by polyacrylamide gel separation followed by autoradiography (Fig. 1). Treatment with increasing amounts of SCH 56582 clearly inhibited mevalonate incorporation into several proteins present in the total cell lysate between 46 and 66 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 1–6). These proteins are believed to be farnesylated (21Reese J.H. Maltese W.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 104: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mevalonate incorporation into proteins that comprise a broad band between 21 and 28 kDa was not inhibited. These proteins consist of a number of members of the small G protein family, which are primarily geranylgeranylated. These results are compatible with the in vitro selectivity of this compound for farnesyl protein transferase over geranylgeranyl transferase-1. Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with the pan-Ras antibody Y13–259. Surprisingly, incorporation of the mevalonate label into immunoprecipitated Ras proteins was not substantially inhibited by increasing concentrations of SCH 56582 (Fig. 1, lanes 7–12). Western blot analysis of DLDpMev lysates revealed approximately equal signals using antibodies specific for N-Ras and K-Ras proteins; the H-Ras signal was very weak relative to the N- and K-Ras signals (data not shown). Since Y13–259 precipitates all Ras isoforms, the proteins immunoprecipitated in Fig. 1 are most likely a mixture of K- and N-Ras. We examined the nature of the prenyl group attached to the immunoprecipitated Ras proteins (Fig. 2) using methyl iodide cleavage and HPLC analysis (18Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Ras-associated prenyl groups derived from untreated DLDpMev cells (Fig. 2 B) migrated similarly to a farnesol standard (the double peak in the sample derived from DLDpMev cells is due to rearrangement of the methyl iodide cleavage product (18Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar)). Following treatment with 20 μmSCH 44342, the large majority of Ras-derived prenyl groups migrate with the geranylgeraniol standard (Fig. 2 C). A full dose-response curve for SCH 56582 is shown in Fig. 2 D. Ras proteins in DLDpMev cells are nearly completely farnesylated in the absence of FTI but become progressively geranylgeranylated in the presence of increasing amounts of SCH 56582. To determine what effect treatment with FTI would have on processing of each of the Ras proteins, we co-transfected COS cells with the mevalonate transporter construct pMEV (17Kim C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23113-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human, activated Ras genes (H-Ras Val-12, N-Ras Asn-12, K-Ras4A Val-12, K-Ras4B Val-12, or the geranylgeranyl transferase-1 substrate H-Ras Val-12-CVLL). Prenylated proteins were labeled by treatment with 10 μmmevastatin and 100 μCi/ml [3H]mevalonate, and Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated with the pan-Ras antibody Y13–259 (Fig. 3). K-Ras4A, K-Ras4B, N-Ras, and H-Ras(CVLL) continue to incorporate [3H]mevalonate in the presence of 7.5 μm SCH 56582. H-Ras labeling, on the other hand, is completely inhibited (H-Ras protein is expressed at similar levels in untreated cells and cells treated with SCH 56582 and mevastatin (see Fig. 5), confirming that the loss of labeled H-Ras in Fig. 3 is due to inhibition of prenylation and not to loss of H-Ras protein). Labeling patterns observed in the whole cell lysates of COS cells were similar to those observed in the whole cell lysates of DLDpMev cells (data not shown).Figure 5Western blots of Ras proteins expressed in COS cells. COS-7 cell lysates were fractionated following transfection with Ras expression vectors into a membrane-enriched particulate fraction (100,000 × g pellet) and a soluble protein fraction (supernatant 100,000 × g). In untreated controls, H-Ras, K-Ras4B, K-Ras4A, N-Ras, and H-Ras-CVLL (geranylgeranylated version of H-Ras) proteins are processed and associate with the particulate fraction. In lysates from cells treated with mevastatin (10 μm), synthesis of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is blocked, and all of the Ras proteins accumulate as unprocessed, soluble precursors. Treatment with SCH 56582 (7.5 μm) displaces H-Ras from the particulate to the soluble fraction, whereas K-Ras4B, K-Ras4A, N-Ras, and H-Ras-CVLL remain associated with the particulate fraction. Note faster mobility of processed Ras proteins (associated with particulate fraction) compared with unprocessed proteins (in the soluble fraction).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isoprene analysis was performed on Ras immunoprecipitates from COS cells transfected with Ras expression vectors (Fig. 4). COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pMev and individual Ras expression vectors, and prenylated proteins were labeled and isolated as described above. Prenyl analysis of immunoprecipitated Ras proteins was done as described for Fig. 2. In the absence of FTI, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and H-Ras contained predominantly (>90%) farnesyl isoprene. This is similar to our results in DLD-1 cells, where Ras proteins were predominantly (>90%) farnesylated in the absence of drug treatment. In the absence of FTI, K-Ras4B was found to contain a higher proportion (approximately 20% of the total) of geranylgeranyl groups, compared with N-, H-, and K-Ras4A. This result was unexpected since previous studies have not detected incorporation of geranylgeranyl groups into K-Ras proteins in untreated cells (for example, see Ref. 18Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) and may be a consequence of the high level of expression of K-Ras4B in COS cells. In COS cells treated with 10 μm SCH 56582, immunoprecipitates of both N-Ras and K-Ras proteins contained predominantly (>90%) geranyl-geranyl isoprenes. H-Ras prenylation is blocked by the inhibitor leading to a loss of label from the immunoprecipitated H-Ras protein. These results extend our observation of alternative prenylation in DLD-1 cells to another cell type, COS-7 cells, and allow analysis of each form of Ras individually. Our ability to detect geranylgeranyl incorporation into K-Ras expressed in COS cells is in contrast to the results of James et al.(16James G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4454-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). They detected farnesyl incorporation into H/K-Ras4BV12 expressed in Rat-1 cells grown in the presence or absence of BZA-5B, a benzodiazepene-based FTI. The differences in our results may be due to the different cell lines or Ras substrates employed. Alternatively, the difference may be due to significantly higher intracellular concentration of mevalonate in our studies due to co-expression of the mevalonate transporter. Rilling et al. (22Rilling H.C. Bruenger E. Leining L.M. Buss J.E. Epstein W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported previously that protein prenylation in Chinese hamster ovary cells can vary as a function of the extracellular mevalonate concentration. The effect of SCH 56582 on processing and localization of the individual Ras proteins was also analyzed by Western blots (Fig.5). COS cells transfected with Ras expression vectors in the presence of 7.5 μm SCH 56582, 20 μmmevastatin (as a positive control for inhibition of processing), or Me2SO (vehicle control) were fractionated into a particulate fraction (100,000 × g pellet) enriched in cellular membranes, and a soluble fraction (supernatant after 100,000 × g). Inhibition of Ras processing can be detected by the slower migration of unprocessed Ras proteins in 15% polyacrylamide gels (23Gutierrez L. Magee A.I. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and by the loss of Ras protein from the membrane fraction. In the absence of SCH 56582 or of mevastatin, each of the Ras proteins associated exclusively with the particulate fraction. Treatment with mevastatin causes loss of all forms of Ras from the particulate fraction and the appearance of their unprocessed, slower-migrating forms in the soluble fraction. In cells treated with SCH 56582, H-Ras is lost from the particulate fraction and appears in the soluble fraction. Both isoforms of K-Ras, in contrast, are prenylated, as determined by their relative (faster) migration, and remain exclusively associated with the particulate fraction. The results with N-Ras in the presence of the farnesyl transferase inhibitor are more complex; most of the N-Ras protein expressed in COS cells is processed in the presence of SCH 56582 and remains associated with the particulate fraction. Some (∼10% of the total) N-Ras protein, however, consistently appears as unprocessed precursor in the soluble fraction (we have noted this partial inhibition of N-Ras prenylation in several experiments, both with antibody detection and with [35S]methionine labeling). These results using Western analysis confirm the results using mevalonate labeling,i.e. N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B are prenylated in the presence of FTI. They reveal further that alternatively prenylated versions of N- and K-Ras remain associated with the membrane fraction in treated cells. The switch in prenylation that occurs in N- and K-Ras proteins in the presence of FTI is probably a consequence of the greater catalytic efficiency of farnesyl protein transferase, compared with geranylgeranyl transferase-1, for these substrates. 2Zhang, F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., in press. Thus, in the absence of FTI, N- and K-Ras precursor proteins are preferentially farnesylated by farnesyl protein transferase. When farnesyl protein transferase is inhibited, N- and K-Ras become available as substrates for geranylgeranyl transferase-1. H-Ras, on the other hand, is not a suitable substrate for geranylgeranyl transferase-1 and so remains unprenylated. The unique sensitivity of H-Ras processing to inhibition suggests that cells whose transformed phenotype depends on H-Ras activity may be particularly responsive to FTI treatment. In agreement with this, we have found that Rat-2 cells transformed with mutant H-Ras are approximately 10–20-fold more sensitive to FTI in the soft agar assay than cells transformed with mutant K-Ras (data not shown); Jameset al. (16James G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4454-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have made similar observations. Normal Ras proteins also play a role in oncogenesis, serving as mediators of transforming signals from mutant tyrosine kinase receptors for example, and one might expect cells in which normal H-Ras plays a significant role in mediating upstream oncogenic signals to be relatively sensitive to FTI treatment. The accumulation of unprocessed H-Ras in the cytosol of cells treated with FTI (see Fig. 5) may also play a part in the mechanism of action of these compounds, perhaps by perturbing normal signaling pathways (for example, see Ref. 24Miyake M. Mizutani S. Koide H. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The alternative processing of N- and K-Ras proteins in the presence of FTI suggests that they may continue to interact with effector proteins under these conditions. In support of this, we have found in co-transfection studies that, whereas H-Ras stimulation of Ras-responsive promoters can be blocked by farnesyl transferase inhibitors, K- and N-Ras stimulation of transcription is only marginally reduced. 3D. B. Whyte, manuscript in preparation. Nonetheless, anchorage-independent growth of K-Ras transformed mouse fibroblasts, and of human tumor cells containing K- and N-Ras mutations, can be inhibited by FTI treatment (9Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Pompliano D.L. Graham S.L. Smith R.L. Scolnick E.M. Oliff A. Gibbs J.B. Science. 1993; 260: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which FTIs inhibit anchorage-independent growth in such cells is unclear. The incorporation of geranylgeranyl rather than farnesyl into N- and K-Ras proteins may cause subtle changes in Ras signaling, perhaps by altering subcellular localization or protein-protein interaction, that lead to reduced ability to grow in an anchorage-independent fashion. Several bifurcating pathways are stimulated by activation of Ras proteins, for example membrane ruffling and mitogenesis (25Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and it is possible that alternative prenylation affects these pathways differently. Alternatively, the mechanism of action of FTIs may involve inhibiting the farnesylation of a target protein other than Ras. The mechanism of action of FTIs is clearly more complex than originally envisioned. The overall result of treatment with FTI may reflect the combined effects of inhibiting the prenylation of some proteins, such as H-Ras and the proteins >30 kDa in the DLDpMev lysate (Fig. 1), and altering the pattern of prenylation of others, such as N- and K-Ras. Other cellular proteins that are normally farnesyl protein transferase substrates may also become geranylgeranylated when farnesyl protein transferase activity is inhibited."

The activation is about 1000-fold more efficient in the presence of thrombomodulin (TM). We investigated the antifibrinolytic potency of maximally activated pCPB in plasma and explored the antifibrinolytic mechanism of pCPB. During clotting of plasma in the presence of 3.3 NIH units/ml thrombin and 1 μg/ml soluble TM, more than 80% pro-pCPB was converted into the active form causing an increase of plasma carboxypeptidase activity from 100 units/liter (constitutive activity ascribed to plasma carboxypeptidase N) to 430 units/liter as measured with furoylacroleyl-alanyl-arginine substrate. Under these conditions, lysis of a plasma clot induced by a range of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentrations (0.2–2 μg/ml) was retarded more than 4-fold. A considerable retardation of fibrinolysis was observed upon addition of as little as 12 ng/ml soluble TM, a concentration comparable with physiological concentrations of soluble TM in human plasma. The presence of Ca2+ appeared to be a critical requirement for effective activation of pro-pCPB by thrombin-TM in plasma. Plasminogen-binding sites (C-terminal lysines) on the surface of a plasmin-treated fibrin clot were eliminated within 1–3 min by plasma with maximally activated pCPB, as studied in a recently described model involving fluorescence microscopy. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that in the absence of TM plasminogen strongly accumulated on fibrin fibers during t-PA-induced lysis of a plasma clot. In the presence of TM (and a concomitant pro-pCPB activation), lysis was slow and was not accompanied by accumulation of plasminogen on the fibers. In conclusion, generation of active pCPB during clotting of plasma in the presence of Ca2+ and TM leads to a retardation of plasma clot lysis in a wide range of t-PA concentrations, from low to therapeutic, and to a fast elimination of plasminogen-binding sites on partially degraded fibrin. This is a likely mechanism for the antifibrinolytic effect of active pCPB.

The molecule circulates in plasma as an inactive zymogen pro-pCPB, which can be converted to an active enzyme by plasmin (Pl) or thrombin (3Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J.

Thrombomodulin (TM) has recently been shown to accelerate the activation of pCPB by thrombin by about 3 orders of magnitude (7Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Another basic carboxypeptidase, Cp N, is constitutively active in plasma and differs from pCPB in terms of substrate specificity toward peptide substrates, esterase activity, and pH optimum, although both enzymes are capable of eliminating C-terminal Arg or Lys residues (1Hendriks D. Sharpe S. Van Sande M. Lommaert M.P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar,2Hendriks D. Wang W. Sharpe S. Lommaert M. Van Sande M. Biochim. Biophys.

The two carboxypeptidases also have a different sensitivity to a number of inhibitors (2Hendriks D. Wang W. Sharpe S. Lommaert M. Van Sande M. Biochim. Biophys.

PCPB is a molecule mediating a negative link between coagulation and fibrinolysis. The existence of such a molecule had been predicted almost a decade ago (9de Fouw N.

It has been demonstrated recently that this effect as well as the acceleration of fibrinolysis in factor XI-deficient plasma (14von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is mediated by a reduction of thrombin-induced activation of pro-pCPB (15Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B.

Premature lysis of clots formed from factor VIII-, IX-, X-, and XI-deficient plasmas can be prevented by supplementation of the deficient plasmas with TM through the mechanism involving thrombin-TM-dependent pCPB activation (18Broze Jr., G.J. Higuchi D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3815-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retardation of fibrinolysis by activated pCPB has been shown in a system of purified components (6Bajzar L. Manuel R.

Circulation. 1996; 93: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cp N is not capable of inhibiting fibrinolysis (8Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2534-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 18Broze Jr., G.J. Higuchi D.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3815-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of antifibrinolytic activity of pCPB may involve direct inactivation of Pl by pCPB as demonstrated recently in a purified system (20Wang W. Boffa M.B. Walker J. Nesheim M.E. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 124Google Scholar). Another possible mechanism may depend upon elimination of C-terminal Lys-residues generated on fibrin as a result of its partial cleavage by Pl during fibrinolysis. These residues are involved in a positive feedback regulation of fibrinolysis serving as additional binding sites for plasminogen (Pg), which acquires a more activable conformation upon binding (21Suenson E. Lutzen O. Thorsen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Norrman B. Wallén P. Rånby M. Eur. J.

Also, binding of Pl to these sites would protect it from inhibition by α2-antiplasmin (26Wiman B. Collen D. Nature. 1978; 272: 549-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Although the removal of C-terminal lysines is believed to be a likely mechanism of action of pCPB (2Hendriks D. Wang W. Sharpe S. Lommaert M. Van Sande M. Biochim. Biophys.

It is not clear whether active pCPB can be generated in plasma to an extent sufficient for effective displacement of C-terminal lysines from partially digested fibrin. In addition, the published data on thein vitro experiments with plasma clots (14von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bajzar L.

It is not clear whether the pCPB system is potent enough to down-regulate therapeutic fibrinolysis induced by much higher doses of t-PA (1–4 μg/ml; Refs. 27Collen D. Lijnen R.H. Todd P.A. Goa K.L. Drugs. 1989; 38: 346-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 28Tanswell P. Tebbe U. Neuhaus K.L. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1992; 19: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To answer these questions, we performed a number of experiments to find the conditions for maximal activation of pro-pCPB in undiluted plasma. Then, we investigated the potency of maximally activated plasma to inhibit fibrinolysis and to eliminate Pg-binding sites from degraded fibrin using a recently described fluorescence microscopy technique (29Sakharov D.V.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), human thrombin, and CHAPS were from Sigma. Human fibrinogen and Pl (activity 15 casein units/mg) were products of Kabi (Stockholm, Sweden). Aprotinin was from Bayer (Leverkusen, Germany). The carboxypeptidase inhibitors, PCI and GEMSA, were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), respectively. The carboxypeptidase substrate furoylacroleyl-alanyl-arginine (FAAR) was from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Rabbit lung TM (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) was used in the study with activity of 1.2 units/μg (1 unit is defined as the amount of TM that complexes 1 NIH unit of thrombin). Pooled citrated platelet-poor plasma from healthy volunteers was used in all experiments involving plasma. Labeling of Glu-Pg with FITC was performed as described previously (30Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Sakharov D.V. Nagelkerke J.F. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2133-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), resulting in a preparation with a molar ratio fluorescein/Pg of 2. Plasma was clotted with thrombin (final concentration 3.3 NIH units/ml) in the absence or presence of TM (final concentration 1.25 units/ml). When indicated, CaCl2was added to a final concentration of 20 mm prior to clotting. After incubation at 37 °C during varying time intervals, the clots were squeezed and discarded. A 7.5-μl aliquot of the remaining fluid phase was transferred to a 1-cm quartz microcuvette containing 550 μl of FAAR (final concentration 0.45 mm) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mmNaCl, and 0.1% CHAPS, pH 7.8. The decrease in optical density at 336 nm was recorded at 22 °C for 15 min with 0.5-min intervals using a Kontron Uvicon-930 spectrophotometer. The Cp activity was calculated from the decrease of A336; a drop in optical density of 0.001/min was defined as 1 unit/liter. This unit is approximately equal to the unit of Cp activity defined by Redlitzet al. (8Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2534-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The activity test was designed to follow pCPB and pro-pCPB in the samples, which also contained constitutively active Cp N interfering with the assay. To distinguish these Cp activities, the measurements were performed for each sample in three parallel cuvettes. In the first cuvette, the constitutive activity (Cp N) in the sample was measured in the presence of 20 μg/ml PCI (a concentration inhibiting pCPB, but not Cp N). The second cuvette contained no inhibitor; thus, the total Cp activity in the sample (Cp N + pCPB) was measured. The potential Cp activity (Cp N + pCPB + pro-pCPB) was determined in the third cuvette by the addition of preformed thrombin-TM complex to a final concentration of 0.125 unit/ml and CaCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mm. Under these conditions pro-pCPB was activated within 5 min. No additional activation could be achieved by increasing the concentration of thrombin-TM or by subsequent addition of a new portion of thrombin-TM, suggesting that the pro-pCPB activation was complete under the selected conditions. (Note: in undiluted plasma, a higher concentration of thrombin-TM was required for maximal pro-pCPB activation, supposedly, due to faster inactivation of thrombin-TM.) Differences between groups of measurements (constitutive, total, and potential activity) for each sample were tested for statistical significance with the paired Student'st test. Similar measurements were performed in unclotted plasma, except the potential Cp activity determination, which could not be measured due to clotting of diluted plasma in the cuvette upon addition of thrombin-TM. 20 μl of human thrombin (20 NIH units/ml) was mixed with 4 μl of TM (serial dilutions starting from 30 units/ml) in the wells of a microtiter plate. Then prewarmed citrated plasma (100 μl) containing t-PA (final concentration in the range 0.05–2 μg/ml added to plasma immediately prior to mixing with thrombin-TM) was added. Plasma was either recalcified by the addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mm or not, as indicated. Where indicated, GEMSA was added to plasma to a final concentration of 1 mm. The optical density at 405 nm was measured during incubation at 37 °C by using a Titertek Multiskan. Upon lysis of the clots, the optical density decreased by about 0.5. Lysis time was defined as the time when a 50% decrease in the optical density occurred. Purified fibrin clots of approximately 2.5 mm in diameter were prepared as described previously (29Sakharov D.V. Domogatsky S.P. Bos R. Rijken D.C. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 116-119Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) by clotting of fibrinogen (9.2 μm) with thrombin (1.4 NIH units/ml) between two parallel glass slides in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 135 mm NaCl (TBS) and 20 mg/ml BSA (TBS-BSA). The remaining volume of the chambers (approximately 25 μl) was filled with TBS-BSA and kept for 20 min at room temperature. Then the clots were subjected to the action of Pl by replacing the buffer in the chambers with TBS-BSA containing 0.15 casein units/ml Pl. After 60 min incubation at 37 °C, the action of Pl was stopped by replacing the Pl-containing buffer by TBS-BSA containing 200 KIU/ml aprotinin. During the treatment with Pl, clot diameters were reduced by approximately 1 mm. The partially digested clots were incubated for different time intervals with the fluid phase from plasma clotted for 10 min with thrombin (3.3 NIH units/ml) either in the presence or in the absence of thrombomodulin (1 unit/ml), as described above. When indicated PCI was added to the fluid phase of clotted plasma immediately after removal of the clot. After the incubation, the plasma samples were washed out with TBS-BSA containing 200 KIU/ml aprotinin and 20 μg/ml PCI, and FITC-Pg (0.5 μm) was added to the clots in the same buffer. After complete equilibration for 20 h at room temperature, the clots were photographed with a fluorescence microscope (Microphot FXA, Nikon). t-PA (final concentration 1.5 μg/ml) was added to recalcified plasma containing tracer FITC-Pg (0.3 μm), and plasma was immediately clotted in a chamber as described above with thrombin (3.3 NIH units/ml) either in the presence or in the absence of TM (1 unit/ml). Confocal images were taken at indicated time intervals at room temperature using a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope (MRC-600 Laser Sharp, Bio-Rad Microscience Ltd., Hemel Hempsted, United Kingdom), as described previously (31Sakharov D.V. Nagelkerke J.F. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2133-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The design of the system allowed the collection of images periodically during the ongoing lysis. To exclude the disturbing influence of the clot/glass interface, all images were taken at a distance of 50 μm from the surface of the glass. The Cp activity was measured using the synthetic substrate FAAR. The design of the test (see “Experimental Procedures”) allowed us to assess, in parallel, 1) the constitutive activity (Cp N), not sensitive to inhibition by PCI; 2) the total activity in the sample (Cp N + pCPB); and 3) the potential activity (Cp N + pCPB + pro-pCPB), as measured upon activation of pro-pCPB. In plasma, the total Cp activity (96 ± 4 units/liter, mean ± S.D., n = 3) did not differ from the constitutive activity (97 ± 7 units/liter), indicating that only Cp N but not pCPB was active in plasma (Fig.1 A, sample 1). After clotting of recalcified plasma with thrombin (Fig.1 A, sample 2), a total Cp activity of 106 ± 5 units/liter was found in the fluid phase, which implies a minor but significant increase of Cp activity above the constitutive level of 99 ± 4 units/liter (p < 0.05). This additional Cp activity can be ascribed to pCPB, since it was inhibited by PCI. The potential activity in the sample was 489 ± 10 units/liter. Thus, about 380 units/liter Cp activity was present in the sample in a latent form (pro-pCPB). When TM was added to the clotting mixture (Fig. 1 A,sample 3), a strong increase of total Cp activity was observed in the fluid phase (up to 404 ± 14 units/liter), exceeding the constitutive Cp level about 4-fold. The potential Cp activity decreased to 424 ± 9 units/liter. From this, we could calculate that the pool of latent Cp (pro-pCPB) was reduced from 380 units/liter to 20 units/liter under these conditions. Generation of Cp activity by thrombin-TM complex was strongly Ca2+-dependent. In the absence of Ca2+, no significant increase of Cp activity over the constitutive level was found (Fig. 1 A, sample 4). The decrease of the potential activity in sample 3 as compared with the potential activity in sample 2 could be explained by partial inactivation of generated pCPB due to its instability (1Hendriks D. Sharpe S. Van Sande M. Lommaert M.P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hendriks D. Wang W. Sharpe S. Lommaert M. Van Sande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the strong elevation of pCPB upon clotting of plasma with thrombin-TM may be transient. This was confirmed in Fig. 1 B, which shows the kinetics of the generation of Cp activity in recalcified citrated plasma upon clotting with 3.3 NIH units/ml thrombin either in the absence or in the presence of 1.25 units/ml TM. In both cases, the constitutive Cp activity (not shown) did not change noticeably for 80 min after clotting, remaining within a range of 93–99 units/liter. Without TM, the total Cp activity almost did not change in time and was slightly higher than the constitutive level; the potential activity also did not change significantly. In the presence of TM, much more Cp activity was generated. The total activity in the sample reached a maximal value of 430 units/liter after a few minutes, and it dropped back to the constitutive level within about 60 min. Under these conditions, the pool of latent Cp activity was almost completely depleted. Concentrations of TM lower than 1.25 units/ml (not shown) generated less Cp activity and caused only a partial depletion of latent Cp. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows the t-PA-induced lysis of plasma clots formed in the presence of various concentrations of soluble TM. In the presence of calcium, TM caused a dose-dependent prolongation of the lysis time, more than 4-fold at TM concentrations higher than 0.1 unit/ml (approximately 80 ng/ml). Noticeable retardation of lysis was documented at a concentration of TM as low as 0.016 unit/ml (about 12 ng/ml). In the absence of Ca2+, TM had no effect on the clot lysis even at the highest concentration used (1 unit/ml, about 800 ng/ml). A specific carboxypeptidase inhibitor, GEMSA, largely inhibited the TM-induced retardation of lysis in the presence of calcium, as shown in Fig. 2 B. In the absence of calcium, GEMSA caused a slight prolongation of lysis time, not dependent on the presence of TM. Fig. 2 C shows that the inhibitory effect of TM on fibrinolysis was manifested throughout a wide range of t-PA concentrations and was most significant at the concentrations of 0.2–2 μg/ml t-PA. The presence of TM resulted in a 4–5-fold prolongation of lysis time; 7–8-fold more t-PA was required to achieve the same lysis time. In the experiments presented in Fig.3, we studied the effect of plasma with either activated or unactivated pro-pCPB on Pg-binding sites present on fibrin partially digested by Pl. In agreement with our earlier results (30Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a Pl-treated fibrin clot accumulated a high concentration of FITC-labeled Pg in a thin superficial layer (D). Incubation of such Pl-treated clots with the fluid phase of thrombin-clotted plasma (E) for 5 min prior to the incubation with FITC-labeled Pg did not affect the superficial Pg-binding sites noticeably. In contrast, the fluid phase of plasma clotted with thrombin in the presence of TM under conditions of maximal pCPB activation largely eliminated the Pg-binding sites within a few minutes (images A–C). The effect was abolished by the addition of the pCPB inhibitor PCI (F). The fast elimination of Pg-binding sites on partially degraded fibrin observed in Fig. 3 suggests that, when activated in plasma, pCPB might reduce the amount of Pg accumulated on fibrin during lysis. This was confirmed directly in experiments involving confocal microscopy (Fig.4). In agreement with our earlier findings (31Sakharov D.V. Nagelkerke J.F. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2133-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in the absence of TM and activation of pro-pCPB, lysis of a plasma clot was accompanied by a progressive accumulation of Pg onto fibrin fibers and onto shrinking remnants of the partially disconnected fibrin network (images B–E). In the presence of TM and concomitant activation of pCPB, lysis lasted about 5-fold longer (70 min instead of 14 min) and was not accompanied by accumulation of additional Pg onto the fibers (G–J). In fact, in this case, the degree of Pg association with the fibrin network did not exceed that observed in intact plasma clots either in the absence (A) or in the presence of TM (F). This study was designed 1) to find conditions for maximal pCPB activation in plasma, 2) to assess the antifibrinolytic potency of maximally activated pCPB in plasma, and 3) to explore the mechanism of the antifibrinolytic activity of activated pCPB. Maximal activation of pro-pCPB was achieved when plasma was clotted with thrombin in the presence of TM. Calcium ions appeared to be essential for the activation (the mechanism of calcium involvement requires a separate investigation, which lies beyond the scope of the present study). Under these conditions, the activity of Cp in plasma increased to 430 units/liter, about 4-fold above its constitutive level (100 units/liter). Thus, the thrombin-TM induced Cp activity was about 330 units/liter. This additional activity was ascribed to active pCPB since it was quantitatively inhibited by PCI, an inhibitor specific for pCPB (8Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2534-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The constitutive plasma Cp activity, represented by Cp N, was not inhibited by PCI. The amount of latent pCPB in plasma was about 380 units/liter. Thus, under the selected conditions, more than 80% of pro-pCPB was converted to the active form in undiluted plasma. The occurrence of active pCPB in plasma at 37 °C was rather transient; the activity declined after 1 h, most likely due to the intrinsic instability of the active form of the enzyme (1Hendriks D. Sharpe S. Van Sande M. Lommaert M.P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hendriks D. Wang W. Sharpe S. Lommaert M. Van Sande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpe S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that clotting of whole human blood, causes a 10–30% increase in the carboxypeptidase activity in serum as compared with plasma (1Hendriks D. Sharpe S. Van Sande M. Lommaert M.P. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar, 19Redlitz A. Nicolini F.A. Malysky J.L. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our results show that this represents less than 10% of the activable pro-pCPB present in plasma. A number of studies have been published recently (14von dem Borne P.A.K. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B.

Blood. 1996; 88: 3815-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that partial pro-pCPB activation during clotting of 2–3-fold diluted human plasma by thrombin causes a 2–3-fold prolongation of fibrinolysis induced by low concentrations of t-PA (30–80 ng/ml). From these data, it is not clear whether the pCPB system is potent enough to down-regulate fibrinolysis induced in undiluted plasma by therapeutic concentrations of 1–4 μg/ml t-PA (27Collen D. Lijnen R.H. Todd P.A. Goa K.L. Drugs. 1989; 38: 346-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Tanswell P. Tebbe U. Neuhaus K.L. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1992; 19: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Here, we show that maximal activation of pro-pCPB in plasma achieved upon clotting in the presence of TM leads to a strong (4–5-fold) retardation of fibrinolysis at t-PA concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2 μg/ml, which is translated to a 7–8-fold increase of t-PA concentration necessary to achieve the same lysis time. Summarizing the first part of the study, we conclude that under specified conditions (presence of calcium and thrombin-TM complex) the pool of pro-pCPB in plasma can be almost completely converted into active pCPB, which effectively down-regulates fibrinolysis induced by therapeutic doses of t-PA. This mechanism may be of particular importance in small blood vessels and capillaries, where the local concentration of endothelium-associated TM is very high (up to 40 μg/ml; Ref. 32Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The significant retardation of lysis at low concentrations of TM (12 ng/ml, see Fig. 2, A andB) suggests that soluble plasma TM (30–50 ng/ml in plasma of healthy subjects (33Amiral L. Adam M. Mimilla F. Larrivaz I. Chambrette B. Boffa M.C. Hybridoma. 1994; 13: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), 70 ng/ml in systemic lupus erythromatosis (34Kawakami M. Kitani A. Hara M. Harigai M. Suzuki K. Kawaguchi Y. Ishii H. Kazama M. Kawagoe M. Nakamura H. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1704-1709PubMed Google Scholar) and up to 200–400 ng/ml in diabetic microangiopathy patients (35Tanaka A. Ishii H. Hiraishi S. Kazama M. Maezava H. Clin. Chem. 1991; 37: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)) may also contribute to a retardation of fibrinolysis in vivo. These considerations establish a rationale for the use of pCPB inhibitors for acceleration of thrombolysis and prevention of thrombosis. In the second part of the study, we investigated the antifibrinolytic mechanism of pCPB using a previously described experimental model using fluorescence microscopy (29Sakharov D.V. Domogatsky S.P. Bos R. Rijken D.C. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 116-119Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Sakharov D.V. Rijken D.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2133-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The fluid phase of plasma clotted in the presence of TM and calcium appeared to be extremely potent in eliminating Pg-binding sites (C-terminal lysine residues) from the surface of a Pl-treated fibrin clot. The Pg-binding sites were displaced within 3 min; a significant reduction of Pg binding was observed as early as after a 1-min treatment of the clots with such plasma. The effect was ascribed to pCPB since it was abolished by the addition of PCI. The effect was not observed when plasma was clotted in the absence of TM. Confocal microscopy experiments showed that the scenario of plasma clot lysis changed drastically when plasma was clotted in the presence of TM under conditions of maximal pCPB-activation. In this case, the relatively slow lysis was not accompanied by accumulation of additional Pg on the fibrin fibers. In the absence of TM, Pg progressively accumulated on fibrin fibers resulting in a 5-fold faster lysis. The importance of the C-terminal lysine residues generated on fibrin upon partial digestion by Pl for a positive feedback regulation of fibrinolysis has been well established (21Suenson E. Lutzen O. Thorsen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Upon binding to these residues, Pg acquires a highly activable conformation, which plays an essential role in fibrin-specific activation of Pg by t-PA (22Norrman B. Wallén P. Rånby M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), single chain urokinase-type PA (23Fleury V. Lijnen H.R. Anglés-Cano E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27912-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Generated Pl is largely protected from inhibition by α2-antiplasmin when bound to these residues (26Wiman B. Collen D. Nature. 1978; 272: 549-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The present study provides one more piece of evidence of the importance of this positive feedback for the regulation of fibrinolysis and demonstrates directly that the antifibrinolytic mechanism of pCPB involves elimination of the Pg-binding sites from partially degraded fibrin. We are grateful to Dr. F. Haverkate (Gaubius Laboratory, TNO Prevention and Health, Leiden) for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2084542346,"The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effects of arachidonic acid, as a representative polyunsaturated fatty acid, on the viability of a Hep G2 cell line, which has been transduced to express human cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1). Arachidonic acid produced a concentration- and time-dependent toxicity to Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells, which express CYP2E1, but little or no toxicity was found with control Hep G2-MV-5 cells, which were infected with retrovirus lacking human CYP2E1 cDNA. In contrast to arachidonic acid, oleic acid was not toxic to the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells. The cytotoxicity of arachidonic acid appeared to involve a lipid peroxidation type of mechanism since toxicity was enhanced after depletion of cellular glutathione; formation of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal was markedly elevated in the cells expressing CYP2E1, and toxicity was prevented by antioxidants such as α-tocopherol phosphate, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), propylgallate, ascorbate, and diphenylphenylenediamine, and the iron chelator desferrioxamine. Transfection of the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells with plasmid containing CYP2E1 in the sense orientation enhanced the arachidonic acid toxicity, whereas transfection with plasmid containing CYP2E1 in the antisense orientation decreased toxicity. The CYP2E1-dependent arachidonic acid toxicity appeared to involve apoptosis, as demonstrated by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and DNA laddering experiments. Trolox, which prevented toxicity of arachidonic acid, also prevented the apoptosis. Transfection with a plasmid containing bcl-2 resulted in complete protection against the CYP2E1-dependent arachidonic acid toxicity. It is proposed that elevated production of reactive oxygen intermediates by cells expressing CYP2E1 can cause lipid peroxidation, which subsequently promotes apoptosis and cell toxicity when the cells are enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid. The Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells appear to be a valuable model to study interaction between CYP2E1, polyunsaturated fatty acids, reactive radicals, and the consequence of these interactions on cell viability and to reproduce several of the key features associated with ethanol hepatotoxicity in the intragastric infusion model of ethanol treatment.

There is current interest in the role of oxidative stress and generation of reactive radical species in the mechanism(s) by which ethanol is toxic to the liver and other tissues (1Nordmann R.

In these models, large increases in lipid peroxidation have been shown to correlate with CYP2E1 levels (15Tsukamoto H. French S.W. Alcohol. 1993; 10: 439-441Google Scholar, 16French S.W. Crit. Rev.

The general hypothesis to account for the liver injury with this model is that elevated production of reactive radical species occurs due to induction of CYP2E1, and this results in lipid peroxidation when the diet is supplemented with PUFA (15Tsukamoto H.

In attempts to directly demonstrate that overexpression of CYP2E1 can result in hepatotoxicity of various agents, a Hep G2 cell line that constitutively expresses the human CYP2E1 was recently established (23Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6926-6937Google Scholar). Electron spin resonance spectroscopy showed that microsomes from Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells that express CYP2E1 produced superoxide radicals at rates about 10-fold greater than those from Hep G2-MV-5 cells that do not express CYP2E1; rates of H2O2 production were about 3-fold greater with the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 microsomes. Rates of microsomal lipid peroxidation were also greater with the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells (23Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6926-6937Google Scholar). Ethanol and acetaminophen were shown to be toxic to Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells but not Hep G2-MV-5 cells (24Dai Y. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 1497-1505Google Scholar, 25Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23914-23919Google Scholar). This model appears to be useful in efforts to establish a CYP2E1-dependent hepatotoxicity system and to evaluate the role of oxidative stress in the toxicity of compounds metabolized by CYP2E1. Increased lipid peroxidation has been implicated as being associated with apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Direct exposure of various cell types to oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or lipid hydroperoxides can directly induce apoptosis; in many experimental models pretreatment of the cells with antioxidants has been shown to protect against this form of cell death (26Talley A.K. Dewhurst S. Perry S.W. Dollard S.C. Gummuluru S. Fine S.M. New D. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Gelbard H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Google Scholar, 27Nobel C.I. Kimland M. Lind B.

The prototypic regulator of mammalian apoptosis is the proto-oncogenebcl-2 (30Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Google Scholar). The functions of bcl-2 have been suggested to include acting as an antioxidant (31Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Google Scholar), modulating some aspects of nuclear transport (32Meikrantz W. Gisselbrecht S. Sun W.T. Schlegel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Google Scholar). Overexpression of bcl-2 leads to protection for many cell types against apoptosis induced by exposure to a wide variety of adverse conditions and stimuli, including lipid peroxidation, suggesting thatbcl-2 controls a distal step in a signal transduction pathway leading to apoptosis (35Hockenbery D.M.

The goal of the current study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity effects of arachidonic acid, a representative PUFA, to Hep G2 cells expressing CYP2E1 and to compare these effects to control cells that do not express CYP2E1. The effect of antioxidants and of bcl-2 on arachidonic acid toxicity and whether the toxicity was apoptotic in nature was also determined. It was hoped that this Hep G2 cell model might be a direct system that can establish linkage between CYP2E1, PUFA, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity and thus mimic in a simple culture system the conditions believed to be representative of the gastric infusion model of ethanol toxicity. Hep G2-MV2E1-9 and Hep G2-MV-5 cells (23Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6926-6937Google Scholar), human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep G2 sublines, were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells contain a copy of the human CYP2E1 cDNA and constitutively express CYP2E1. Hep G2-MV-5 cells are the appropriate controls for Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells as they contain only viral vector lacking the CYP2E1 cDNA. Most reagents were from Sigma. Specific reagents are described below. Cytotoxicity of PUFA was primarily measured by the MTT assay (44Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar). Tetrazolium salts such as MTT are metabolized by mitochondrial dehydrogenases to form a blue formazan dye and are therefore useful for the measurement of cytotoxicity. Approximately 2.0–2.5 × 104 cells, suspended in MEM containing 2 mm 4-methylpyrazole (added to stabilize CYP2E1 against degradation), were plated onto each well of a 24-well plate (Corning Co.) and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h. Test reagents, such as arachidonic acid and oleic acid, were then added to the culture medium for a designated preincubation time, typically 24 h. The culture medium was then replaced with normal MEM (without 4-methylpyrazole). After an additional incubation, typically 8 or 24 h, the medium was removed and cell viability was evaluated by the MTT assay, which was performed using the Promega Cell Titer 96 Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. Briefly, 15% volume of dye solution was added to each well for a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. An equal volume of solubilization/stop solution was then added to each well for an additional 1-h incubation. The absorbance of the reaction solution at 570 nm was recorded. The absorbance at 630 nm was used as reference. The net A570–A630 was taken as the index of cell viability. The net absorbance from the wells of cells cultured with control medium was taken as the 100% viability value. The percent viability of the treated cells was calculated by the formula (A570 −A630)sample/(A570− A630)control × 100. Leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured as another index of cytotoxicity. Approximately 1–2 × 106 cells were plated onto each well of a 6-well plate (Corning Co.) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then treated with arachidonic acid or oleic acid for a 24-h period, followed by a second 24-h incubation period in the absence of fatty acid as described above. At the end of treatment, the combined media were collected to measure LDH activity (referred to as LDHout). Cells were harvested by scraping, washed with PBS, suspended in 1 ml of PBS, and sonicated by using a Heat Systems-Ultrasonics Model W-375 Sonicator™ (5 s, duty cycle 25%, output control 40%). The LDH activity of the total cell lysate was measured (referred to as LDHin). Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay Kit LD-L20 (Sigma) was used for the quantitative kinetic determination of LDH activity. The reagent contains 50 mmlactate plus 7 mm NAD+ in a pH 8.9 buffer system. To determine the LDH activity, 50–200-μl aliquots of cell tissue culture medium or of cell lysates were added to the LDH assay system, and the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to NADH formation was recorded. The cytotoxicity index was expressed as the ratio of LDHout/LDHin. Apoptosis in individual cells was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) techniques as described by Gavrieli et al. (45Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Google Scholar) and Portera-Cailliau et al. (46Portera-Cailliau C. Sung C.H. Nattans J. Adler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 974-978Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 5 × 105 Hep G2-MV2E1-9 or Hep G2-MV-5 cells were plated onto each well of 6-well culture plates. After incubation with or without arachidonic acid, cells were washed twice with PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C, adjusted to a concentration of 0.2 × 107 per 0.2 ml of PBS buffer, and fixed with 0.1 ml of freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution (in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 0.1 ml of permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton® X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice, followed by washing twice with PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then resuspended in 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture or label solution (without terminal transferase) as negative control, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark, followed by washing twice in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS® Profile Analyzer, Coulter Corp.). DNA fragmentation was determined to evaluate apoptosis (47Harmom J.M. Norman M.R. Fowlkes B.J. Thompson E.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 267-278Google Scholar, 48Vedeckis W.V. Bradshaw Jr., H.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1983; 30: 215-227Google Scholar, 49Caron-Leslie L.A. Cidlowski J.A. Mol.

After incubation with or without arachidonic acid, cells were scraped off the 6-well culture plates with culture medium and were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm × 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, and 0.5% SDS) and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. After lysis, samples were extracted with 2 ml of phenol (neutralized with TE buffer, pH 7.5), followed by extraction with 1 ml of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The aqueous supernatants were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol plus 10% volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at −20 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min, the pellets were air-dried, resuspended with 50 μl of TE buffer, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1 μg/ml RNase A, and electrophoretically separated on a 1.5% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 100 V for 2 h. Pictures of the gels were taken by UV transillumination. The full-length humanbcl-2 cDNA, excised from pSFFV-bcl-2 expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. George Acs and Dr. Beatriz Pogo, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY), and human CYP2E1 cDNA, excised from p91023(B)-2E1 (kindly provided by Dr. F. J. Gonzalez, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda), were inserted into the EcoRI restriction site of pCI-neo expression vector (Promega), in the sense and antisense (as) orientations to form pCI-bcl-2 or pCI-as-bcl-2, and pCI-2E1 or pCI-as-2E1, respectively. Transfection of Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells was carried out by utilizing the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by Hawley-Nelson et al. (51Hawley-Nelson P. Ciccarone V. Gebeyehu G. Jessee J. Felgner P.L. Focus. 1993; 15: 3-10Google Scholar). Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells were grown to 80–90% confluence and harvested by trypsinization, and 1.5 × 106 cells were seeded into a 100-mm culture dish and grown until 50–70% confluence. Cells were rinsed with serum-free MEM before transfection. Solution A (15 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA in 800 μl of serum-free MEM) and solution B (100 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent in 800 μl of serum-free MEM) were gently mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to form a DNA-liposome complex. The complex was diluted with 6.4 ml of MEM, added to the Petri dish containing the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells, followed by incubation for 5 h at 37 °C in a CO2incubator. 8 ml of MEM with 20% fetal calf serum was then added to each culture dish. After 18 h of incubation, fresh MEM was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 days. The cells were collected by trypsinization and used for Western blot analysis and for studies with arachidonic acid. Cell lysis was achieved by sonication (5 s, duty cycle 25%, output control 40%), followed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and protein determined with the DC-20 Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Protein (50 μg for each sample) was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transblotted onto nitrocellulose sheets (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar, 53Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4355Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-human CYP2E1 polyclonal antibody (provided by Dr. J. M. Lasker, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine) and mouse anti-human-bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) were used as the primary antibodies followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase either conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) or to rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) as the second antibody. Staining intensity was developed with the NBT-BCIP mixture (Promega). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), end products derived from peroxidation of PUFA and related esters, provide a convenient index as a measure for lipid peroxidation (54Esterbauer H. Cheeseman K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 407-447Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation in Hep G2-MV2E1-9 and Hep G2-MV-5 cells was monitored by measuring total MDA and 4-HNE production, utilizing the lipid peroxidation assay kit, LPO-586 (Calbiochem). Briefly, after incubating the cells with varying concentrations of arachidonic acid, the tissue culture medium from the first and second 24-h incubation period was collected and assayed. The cells were collected by scraping and centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The protein content of the cell lysates was determined (Bio-Rad DC-20 Protein Assay Kit) followed by the LPO-586 assay. It has been show that dietary fat composition and subsequent elevated lipid peroxidation are related to the severity of alcohol-induced liver injury in the intragastric feeding rat model. To evaluate a role of PUFA in alcohol-related toxicity, Hep G2-MV2E1-9 and Hep G2-MV-5 cells were loaded with arachidonic acid (20:4) for 24 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed and continuously incubated at 37 °C for an additional 24 h in normal MEM. Cell viability was then assessed by the MTT assay. Pretreatment with 0.03 mmarachidonic acid caused 43–72% (mean of 62%) loss of viability to Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells, whereas no significant loss of viability (0–13%, mean of 4%) was found with Hep G2-MV-5 cells. Compared with arachidonic acid, oleic acid (18:1) showed no significant toxicity to the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells even at concentrations (0.05 mm) in which arachidonic acid was highly cytotoxic (TableI). Arachidonic acid toxicity was also evaluated by morphology and by the LDH leakage assay. As shown in Fig.1, arachidonic acid caused a 3-fold increase of LDH leakage, in terms of LDHout/LDHin ratio, with Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells, 24 h after removal of arachidonic acid. Only a small increase (30%) in LDH leakage was found with Hep G2-MV-5 cells. In contrast to arachidonic acid, preloading cells with oleic acid did not result in increased LDH leakage by the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 (and Hep G2-MV-5) cells (Fig. 1). Arachidonic acid caused substantial morphological changes when added to the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells as many cells were detached and floated to the top of the culture dish; cells were shrunken and dispersed and a monolayer was not formed (Fig.2). No such changes in morphology were evident when arachidonic acid was added to the Hep G2-MV-5 cells (Fig. 2).Table IComparison of the effect of arachidonic acid and oleic acid on the viability of Hep G2-MV2E1–9 cellsAddition% viabilityWithout BSOWith BSO0.02 mm oleic acid89.9 ± 10.996.7 ± 3.90.02 mm arachidonic acid72.9 ± 1.847.9 ± 4.70.05 mm oleic acid89.2 ± 9.198.2 ± 3.30.05 mm arachidonic acid17.2 ± 5.80.0 ± 0.2Hep G2-MV2E1–9 cells were incubated with 0.02 or 0.05 mmoleic acid or arachidonic acid for 24 h in the absence or presence of 0.1 mm BSO.

The medium was removed and replaced by normal MEM and a second incubation for 24 h was carried out in the absence of fatty acid. Cell viability was then evaluated by the MTT assay. To characterize the cytotoxicity produced by arachidonic acid, time course and dose-dependent experiments were conducted. The cytotoxic effect of preloading with various concentrations of arachidonic acid is shown in Fig. 3A. At concentrations of 0.005 or 0.01 mm, there was no significant toxicity by arachidonic acid in either cell line. At 0.02–0.03 mm, arachidonic acid caused significant toxicity to Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells but not to Hep G2-MV-5 cells. At a concentration of 0.05 mm, arachidonic acid caused more than 80% loss of viability of Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells; some toxicity was also observed in Hep G2-MV-5 cells although it was significantly lower than that in the Hep G2-MV2E1-9 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, some toxicity by arachidonic acid could be observed immediately after the initial 24-h preincubation period, and this toxicity became more pronounced during the second incubation period after remov"
https://openalex.org/W2049169085,"Mutations in Ras family members that confer oncogenic potential are frequently observed in specific human cancers. We report that human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines that harbor oncogenic mutations in Ki-Ras (H460, A549, H2122) synthesized high levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) compared with NSCLC lacking Ras mutations or non-transformed lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). This increased PGE2 production was mediated by constitutively high expression of 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). The increased expression of cPLA2 protein was mediated through elevated mRNA levels and activation of the cPLA2 promoter. Induction of cPLA2 promoter activity was blocked by expression of dominant-negative forms of Ras. Inhibition of Ras by the farnesyltransferase inhibitor BZA-5B inhibited prostaglandin synthesis in H2122 cells by decreasing expression of both cPLA2 and COX-2. Finally, inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis blocked anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC lines exhibiting Ki-Ras mutations. These results identify cPLA2 as a novel Ras-inducible regulator of eicosanoid synthesis that participates in cellular transformation.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Google Scholar). Significantly, disruption of the post-translational processing of the Ras polypeptides with farnesyltransferase inhibitors has established that the Ras proteins perform a dominant transforming role in NSCLC that harbor constitutively activated Ras polypeptides (6Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4243-4247Google Scholar). non-small cell lung cancer phospholipase A2 prostaglandin E2 cyclooxygenase high performance liquid chromatography Enhanced release of arachidonic acid, the precursor for a host of eicosanoids that modulate diverse physiological and pathophysiological responses, has been associated with transformation of fibroblasts by oncogenic Ras (7Guthridge C.J.

Signalling. 1991; 3: 321-332Google Scholar) and Src (9Barker K. Aderem A. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2929-2935Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid can be metabolized to a variety of bioactive lipid mediators through the action of three families of enzymes: cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. Two forms of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) have been described that convert arachidonic acid to PGH2, the common precursor of prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes (10Goetzl E.J. An S. Smith W.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Google Scholar). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cells. COX-2 levels are low in resting cells and markedly induced by mitogenic and inflammatory agents, as well as oncogenic transformation (10Goetzl E.J. An S. Smith W.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Google Scholar). Observations that up-regulation of COX-2 occurs in human colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas (11Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2556-2559Google Scholar), coupled with the findings that the COX inhibitors decrease the occurrence of these tumors and hyperplasias (13Rao C.V. Rivenson A. Simi B. Zang E. Kelloff G. Steele V. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1464-1472Google Scholar, 14Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5575-5589Google Scholar), indicate that metabolites of arachidonic acid serve as important co-factors in the progression of human cancers. As the resting level of unesterified arachidonic acid is normally low within cells, activation of phospholipase A2(PLA2), which releases arachidonic acid from phospholipid stores, represents the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of different eicosanoids. Multiple forms of PLA2 have been described. Among the forms of PLA2 expressed in mammalian tissues, the intracellular forms, of which cPLA2 is perhaps the best characterized, are thought to mediate hormone-regulated arachidonic acid release (15Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzamn L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Google Scholar). This enzyme, which is specific for arachidonate-containing phospholipids, is acutely regulated through increases in intracellular Ca2+ (16Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Google Scholar, 17Gronich J.H. Bonventre J.V. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16645-16651Google Scholar) and protein phosphorylation (18Lin L.-L. Wartmann M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1960-1964Google Scholar). In addition to post-translational regulation, induction of cPLA2 expression has been reported in response to cytokines such as interleukin-1β (20Hulkower K.I. Hope W.C. Chen T. Anderson C.M. Coffey J.W. Morgan D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 712-718Google Scholar) and TNF-α (21Hoeck W.G. Ramesha C.S. Chang D.J. Fan N. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4475-4479Google Scholar), as well as growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (22Maxwell A.P. Goldberg H.J. Tay A.H.-N. Li Z.-G. Arbus G.S. Skorecki K.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 763-766Google Scholar). The promoter for cPLA2 has been isolated from both human (23Wu T. Ikezono T. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5093-5098Google Scholar) and rat (24Tay A. Maxwell P. Li Z. Goldberg H. Skorecki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 345-347Google Scholar) and contains a number of putative regulatory elements, including AP-1 sites, NF-κB, and glucocorticoid regulatory elements. While is likely that constitutively elevated eicosanoid production is mediated through increased PLA2 activity as well as induction of metabolizing enzymes, regulation of cPLA2 has not been well examined in tumor cells. In this study we have examined the mechanisms leading to increased eicosanoid production in a panel of cultured human NSCLC lines. Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (H2122, A549, H1334, H661, and H460) and SV40-immortalized lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were obtained from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Cancer Center Tissue Culture Core and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For determination of anchorage-independent growth, single-cell suspensions of the indicated NSCLC lines were prepared, and portions containing 10,000 cells were suspended in 1.5 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.3% nobel agar and layered over a base prepared in 35-mm diameter dishes of RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5% agarose supplemented with the various eicosanoid synthesis inhibitors at twice the indicated concentration. The dishes were incubated for 3–4 weeks at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator, and colonies were visualized under a microscope and counted. For experiments using the farnesyl transferase inhibitor BZA-5B (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), stock solutions were prepared as described previously (25James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Google Scholar). Cells were treated for 5 days with fresh additions of drug every second day. Control cells were comparably treated with vehicle alone. For determinations of PGE2, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and PGE2 released into the media was determined using a radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham Corp.), following the manufacturer's protocol. For PLA2 activity determinations, cells were harvested and PLA2 activity determined in the high speed supernatants using exogenous [14C]arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine, as described previously (17Gronich J.H. Bonventre J.V. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16645-16651Google Scholar). Results are expressed a picomoles/min/mg. Previous investigations by Boyd and co-workers (26Hubbard W.C. Alley M.C. Gray G.N. Green K.C. McLemore T.L. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 826-832Google Scholar, 27McLemore T.L. Hubbard W.C. Litterst C.L. Lin M.C. Miller S. McMahon N.A. Eggleston J.C. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3140-3147Google Scholar) detected elevated prostaglandin levels in primary NSCLC lung tumor tissues and noted the synthesis of various prostaglandins, especially PGE2 in several cultured NSCLC lines. We initially analyzed arachidonic acid metabolites released from NSCLC lines by reverse phase HPLC. The major metabolite identified by HPLC was confirmed by mass spectroscopy to be PGE2, although several unidentified minor metabolites were also detected (data not shown). Analysis by radioimmunoassay of PGE2 in medium from the various NSCLC lines and the SV40-immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, revealed significant PGE2 release in NSCLC lines H460, A549, and H2122 compared with low or undetectable synthesis by H661, H1334, and BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 1A). Significantly, high expression of the COX-2 protein in H460, A549, and H2122 correlated with marked production of PGE2 (Fig.1A, inset). By contrast, COX-1 and 12-lipoxygenase were similarly expressed among the various cell lines (data not shown). While induction of COX-2 presumably accounts for the high levels of PGE2 production in these NSCLC lines, availability of unesterified arachidonic acid through the action of PLA2represents the rate-limiting step in eicosanoid production. Analysis of PLA2 activity in high speed supernatants prepared from extracts of the same panel of NSCLC lines revealed an extraordinarily high level of PLA2 activity in NSCLC lines H460, A549, and H2122 relative to BEAS-2B cells or NSCLC lines H661 and H1334 (Fig.1B). Activity assayed in the absence of Ca2+ was less than 10% than that observed in the presence of Ca2+, indicating Ca2+-dependent form(s) of the enzyme. Immunoblot analysis of extracts from the panel of cell lines using a specific cPLA2 antiserum revealed high expression of cPLA2 protein in A549, H460, and H2122 cells relative to the little or no cPLA2 detected in BEAS-2B, H1334, and H661 cells (Fig. 1B, inset). Fractionation of cell extracts by Mono Q anion exchange revealed a single peak of PLA2activity that co-migrated with purified cPLA2 (data not shown). Thus, increased expression of cPLA2 protein accounts for the high specific activity of PLA2 detected in NSCLC lines H460, A549, and H2122. Northern blotting revealed that levels of cPLA2 mRNA were markedly induced in both H2122 and A549 cells compared with BEAS-2B or H1334 (Fig. 2A), suggesting increased transcription. In fact, transient expression of a cPLA2 promoter/luciferase construct in the NSCLC lines revealed resulted in a 8–20-fold in luciferase activity in H2122 cells compared with either BEAS-2B or H1334, which express little or no cPLA2 (Fig. 2B). These data argue for transcriptional activation of the cPLA2 gene as the mechanism for cPLA2 induction. Previous analysis of the status of Ras genes in established lung cancer cell lines demonstrated that A549, H460, and H2122, which we have shown to exhibit high expression of cPLA2 and COX-2, express Ki-Ras molecules with mutations that confer gain-of-function (3Mitsudomi T. Viallet J. Mulshine J.L. Linnoila R.I. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1353-1362Google Scholar). In contrast, H661 and H1334 express wild-type Ki-Ras polypeptides (28Phelps R.M. Johnson B.E. Ihde D.C. Gazdar A.F. Carbone D.P. McClintock P.R. Linnoila R.I. Matthews M.J. Bunn Jr., P.A. Carney D. Minna J.D. Mulshine J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1996; 24: 32-91Google Scholar). The correlation of expression of GTPase-deficient Ki-Ras with high expression of cPLA2 and COX-2 supports our hypothesis that mutated Ras stimulates a signaling pathway leading to the transcriptional induction of the cPLA2. To test this possibility, NSCLC were therefore transiently co-transfected with a dominant-negative Ras construct (N17Ras) along with the cPLA2 promoter-luciferase construct. Expression of N17Ras significantly reduced the induction of cPLA2 promoter activity in H2122 (Fig. 2B), supporting a role for persistent Ras signaling in cPLA2 induction. The role of oncogenic Ras in mediating eicosanoid production in NSCLC was further examined using the farnesyltransferase inhibitor BZA-5B. This drug has been shown to reverse transformation by oncogenic Ras in various cell types including NSCLC (6Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4243-4247Google Scholar, 25James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Google Scholar), presumably by interfering with post-translational modifications of the protein required for function. BZA-5B potently inhibited the growth of H2122 cells that express oncogenic Ki-Ras, but had only a slight effect on the growth of BEAS-2B or H1334 cells which do not (Fig.3A), confirming an important role for Ras in the transformed growth of this cell line. Constitutive PGE2production was decreased by ∼60% in H2122 exposed to 100 μm BZA-5B (+BZA-5B: 1.52 ± 0.3 pg/μg of protein; vehicle: 3.78 ± 0.3 pg/μg of protein; p < 0.05). This decrease was associated with decreased cPLA2specific activity (Fig. 3B) and COX-2 expression (Fig.3C). To test the contribution of constitutive PGE2 production to the transformed growth of the NSCLC lines, the influence of COX inhibitors on the ability of NSCLC cells to grow in soft agar-containing medium was examined (Fig. 4). The data reveal that increasing concentrations of sulindac sulfide, an effective inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2 (29Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Google Scholar), significantly inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of the H460, A549, and H2122 NSCLC lines. Indomethacin, a preferential inhibitor of COX-1 (29Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Google Scholar), was much less effective. Attempts to test the inhibitory potential of sulindac sulfide on NSCLC lines H661 and H1334, which produce little or no PGE2, were complicated by the poor cloning efficiency (<0.01%) of these NSCLC lines in the soft agar assay. 2L. E. Heasley, B. Price, and R. A. Nemenoff, unpublished observations. Analysis of the growth of NSCLC cells attached to plastic dishes revealed a cytostatic, not cytotoxic, action of sulindac sulfide. Thus, these findings support the involvement of eicosanoids generated by the action of cPLA2and COX-2 in the anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC. Interestingly, nordihydroguaiaretic acid and cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate, selective inhibitors of lipoxygenase family members (30Cho H. Ueda M. Tamaoka M. Hamaguchi M. Aisaka K. Kiso Y. Inoue T. Ogino R. Tatsuoka T. Ishihara T. Noguchi T. Morita I. Murota S. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 1505-1508Google Scholar, 31Salari H. Braquet P. Borgeat P. Prostaglandins Leukot. Med. 1984; 13: 53-60Google Scholar), also potently blocked anchorage-independent NSCLC growth (Fig. 4). Like sulindac sulfide, nordihydroguaiaretic acid and cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate exerted cytostatic effects in NSCLC cells grown on tissue culture plastic. Elevated eicosanoid production has been observed in a number of tumor cells and is likely to contribute to the transformed growth of these cells. Mutations in Ras family members that inhibit GTPase activity and confer oncogenic potential are frequently observed in various human cancers in addition to NSCLC, including colon carcinomas, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, follicular and undifferentiated carcinomas of the thyroid, and acute myeloid leukemias (1Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689Google Scholar). Induction of COX-2 and production of PGE2 have been noted in colon carcinomas, and inhibitors of cyclooxygenases, including sulindac and aspirin, exhibit preventative effects toward the development of colon cancer (11Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Google Scholar, 12Kargman S.L. O'Neill G.P. Vickers P.J.

However, the availability of unesterified arachidonic acid, regulated through the activity of PLA2, is considered rate-limiting for the subsequent formation of eicosanoids, suggesting that tumor cells may also have elevated expression of PLA2 isoforms. Our data show that NSCLC expressing oncogenic forms of Ras (H460, A549, and H2122) show induction of both COX-2 and cPLA2 resulting in high levels of PGE2 production. Furthermore, inhibition of Ras by either expression of dominant-negative forms, or by treating cells with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, reduces expression of both enzymes. Previous studies in which oncogenic Ras was introduced in cultured cells have also documented an increase in PLA2activity (7Guthridge C.J. Zimmer S.G. Steiner M.R. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 1957-1962Google Scholar) and support our findings in NSCLC. We have noted recently the ability of ectopically expressed H-RasG12V to induce cPLA2 expression and PGE2 production in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. 3X. Li and R. A. Nemenoff, submitted for publication. Thus, cPLA2 is an attractive candidate as a novel distal effector of Ras-mediated events. Induction of cPLA2 is likely to have important consequences in these cells beyond facilitation of PGE2 production. Additional arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzymes such as 12-lipoxygenase appear to be constitutively expressed in NSCLC cells.2 Thus, a marked induction of cPLA2 would increase the availability of arachidonic acid for conversion not only to PGE2, but also other eicosanoids such as hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, by constitutively expressed lipoxygenases. Indeed, the hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids have been invoked as accessory mitogenic factors in settings of both normal and transformed cell growth (32Rao G.N. Baas A.S. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32586-32591Google Scholar, 33Tang D.G. Chen Y.Q. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5241-5246Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that multiple eicosanoids will be synthesized by constitutively and inducibly expressed arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzyme pathways in settings where cPLA2 expression and activity are increased. This possibility is also suggested by the ability of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors to block anchorage-independent growth of these cells (Fig. 4). The potential utility of specific PLA2 inhibitors as therapeutics for the treatment of cancers where eicosanoid pathways play critical roles in maintenance of the transformed phenotype therefore needs to be examined."

The mature NC1 polypeptide contains 1,235 amino acids and is characterized by the presence of a segment with 40% homology to cartilage matrix protein, nine consecutive fibronectin type III-like repeats (FNIII), a segment with homology to the A domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF-A), a potential cell attachment site RGD motif, and a segment rich in cysteine and proline at the carboxyl-terminal end of NC1. The NC1 domain also contains three consensus sequences, NX(S/T), forN-linked glycosylation. Other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins have domains with homology to the FNIII and VWF-A domains. Studies with these ECM proteins have demonstrated that these motifs are capable of binding to different types of collagen and may mediate significant protein-protein interactions (19Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Google Scholar, 20Keene D.R. Engvall E. Glanville R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1995-2006Google Scholar, 21Bonaldo P. Russo V. Bucciotti F. Colombatti A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1245-1254Google Scholar). The NC1 domain of type VII collagen has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions. Solid phase binding studies suggest that it interacts with type IV collagen, a major component of the lamina densa and anchoring plaques (22Burgeson R.E. Lunstrum G.P. Rokosova B. Rimberg C.S. Rosenbaum L.M. Keene D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 32-43Google Scholar). It has been shown that autoantibodies in the serum of EBA patients recognize epitopes within the NC1 domain of type VII collagen, particularly within the FNIII and VWF-A submodules (23Lapiere J.C. Woodley D.T. Parente M.G. Iwasaki T. Wynn K.C. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1831-1839Google Scholar, 24Gammon W.R. Murrel D.F. Jenison M.W. Padilla K.M. Prisayanh P.S. Jones D.A. Briggaman R.A. Hunt III, S.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 93: 618-622Google Scholar). Therefore, these regions may play a direct role in adhesion of type VII collagen to other BMZ and matrix proteins. The exact function of the NC1 domain, however, is not known. The lack of knowledge about NC1 is at least partly due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantity of purified NC1 by biochemical means, because type VII collagen represents less than 0.001% of the total collagen extracted from human skin (25Bruckner-Tuderman L. Schnyder U.W. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 607-611Google Scholar). Furthermore, a major problem in studying the biological functions of type VII collagen has been the necessity of using denaturing or proteolytic conditions to release type VII collagen from supramolecular complexes with other extracellular macromolecules during purification procedures. In the current study, we used an efficient eukaryotic expression system to obtain large quantities of recombinant NC1 in conditioned medium from human kidney 293 cells. The recombinant NC1 was found to resemble authentic NC1 with regard to structural and functional properties. Our functional studies on the binding of NC1 to several ECM proteins, including type IV collagen, fibronectin, a complex of laminin 5 and laminin 6 (laminin 5/6), and type I collagen provide a molecular basis for the role of NC1 in epidermal-dermal adherence of human skin and in anchoring fibril assembly. This study also sets the stage for producing and characterizing mutants of NC1 for further dissection of the various structural and functional domains. The fragment corresponding to the 5′ end of human type VII collagen cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification using human amniotic epithelial cells (WISH) cDNA as template and oligonucleotides MC1: GGATCCCTCGGACCTGCCAAGGCCC AC: and L3: GAATTCAGGTCGGGTCACAGGCACGC as primers based on the published sequences (12Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20256-20262Google Scholar). The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 7 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C, 45 s; 57 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min; and a 7-min extension at 72 °C. The PCR product was subcloned into a TA vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and DNA sequence analysis was performed and compared with the published sequence to confirm its identity (12Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20256-20262Google Scholar). The NC1 domain of type VII collagen cDNA (3.8 kb), which encodes the entire open reading frame including the signal peptide at the 5′ end as well as a PCR-generated in frame stop codon at the 3′ end, was prepared from the 5′ end fragment and three cDNA clones previously described (23Lapiere J.C. Woodley D.T. Parente M.G. Iwasaki T. Wynn K.C. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1831-1839Google Scholar). The construct utilized the overlapping internal restriction sites including ApaLI,XhoI, and AvrII from each cDNA fragment. The subsequent constructs were made in M13 mp18, TA vector and pGEX vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), as modified by Dr. George Giudice, Medical College of Wisconsin (23Lapiere J.C. Woodley D.T. Parente M.G. Iwasaki T. Wynn K.C. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1831-1839Google Scholar). The correct ligation and in frame insertion of various DNA fragments were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The entire NC1 domain construct was ligated into theHindIII/XbaI-restricted eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) which was designated as CMV/NC1 as shown in Fig. 1. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium/Ham's F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The CMV/NC1 construct was transfected into 293 cells using Lipofectin (1:1 (w/w) liposome formulation of the cationic lipidN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride, and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Life Technologies, Inc.)). Cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at 106 cells per dish and allowed to recover overnight, then transfected using a ratio of 70 μl of Lipofectin to 25 μg of DNA with incubation for 6 h in serum-free medium. The medium was changed to one containing serum, and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. The transfected cells were then removed by trypsinization and plated on 150-mm dishes and cultured in the presence of 500 μg of G418/ml medium for 2–3 weeks. Individual clones resistant to G418 were isolated with a cloning cylinder, removed by trypsinization, and grown in G418-containing medium. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted using guanidine isothiocyanate/CsCl2 density gradient centrifugation, as described previously (26Wang S.Y. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5880-5884Google Scholar). The total RNA was size-fractionated and transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus, DuPont NEN) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled (random-primer labeling kit, BMB, Indianapolis, IN) 2.4-kb human type VII collagen cDNA probe containing FNIII submodules within the NC1 domain. For immunoblot analysis, clonal cell lines resistant to G418 were grown to confluence, the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and the cultures were maintained for an additional 24 h. The media were collected, concentrated 10-fold by Centricon-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane as described (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). The presence of recombinant NC1 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody, LH 7.2 (1:200) (Sigma), against the NC1 domain of type VII collagen followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Corp., UK). For large scale purification of recombinant NC1, serum-free media were equilibrated to 5 mm EDTA, 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μmN-ethylmaleimide, and precipitated with 300 mg/ml ammonium sulfate at 4 °C overnight with stirring (4Lunstrum G.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9042-9048Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 1 h, resuspended and dialyzed in Buffer A containing 65 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 1 mm EDTA, and passed over a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. Proteins that did not bind to the column were further purified on a Superdex 200 (HR 10/30. Pharmacia) equilibrated in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mmNaCl. Proteins secreted into the medium of WISH cells were precipitated with ammonium sulfate as described (4Lunstrum G.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9042-9048Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, and 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Next, 50 units of bacterial collagenase (clostridiopeptidase A type III, Sigma) were added. The enzymatic digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. The digestion product was subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above or deglycosylation as described below. Purification of the authentic NC1 domain of type VII collagen from collagenase digests of human amnion was accomplished as described previously (28Bachinger H.P. Morris N.P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Rosenbaum L.M. Compton L.A. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10095-10101Google Scholar) using affinity chromatography with coupled monoclonal antibodies NP185 and NP32. Purified authentic NC1 was used for ECM binding studies as described below. Confluent 293 cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin diluted from a 500 μg/ml tunicamycin stock solution in 0.01 n NaOH (Sigma) in serum containing medium. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h in serum-free medium. The media were collected, concentrated 10-fold by Centricon-10, and subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Purified recombinant NC1 (100 ng) or authentic NC1 was denatured by heating at 100 °C in the presence of 1% SDS for 5 min and treated with 0.5 unit of peptideN-glycosidase F (Sigma) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 h at 37 °C and then analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Binding of soluble NC1 to immobilized ligands followed by a colorimetric enzyme-linked antibody reaction was performed as described previously (29Woodley D.T. Rao C.N. Hassell J.R. Liotta L.A. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 761: 278-283Google Scholar). Multiwell plates (96 wells, Dynatch Laboratory Inc., Alexandria, VA) were coated overnight with ECM proteins (4 μg) in 100 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.3. The wells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Coated wells were subsequently incubated with purified recombinant or authentic NC1 at concentrations between 2.5 to 40 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. The binding of NC1 to ECM proteins was detected with a mixture of monoclonal anti-type VII collagen antibodies clone 185 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and LH 7.2 (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:300 followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400) (Organon Teknika-Cappel, Durham, NC). The development of a colorimetric reaction using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate (Bio-Rad) was measured by reading the absorbance of the product at 405 nm (Labsystems Multiskan Multisoft, Finland). The ligands used for binding included collagen types I, IV, and V (Collaborative Biomedical Product, Bedford, MA) and pepsinized type IV collagen (Life Technologies, Inc.). Laminin 1 was prepared from the EHS tumor as described (29Woodley D.T. Rao C.N. Hassell J.R. Liotta L.A. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 761: 278-283Google Scholar). Fibronectin was prepared from human plasma as described previously (30O'Keefe E.J. Woodley D.T. Castillo G. Russel N. Payne Jr., R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1984; 82: 150-155Google Scholar) or purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Purified fragments corresponding to the 7 S and NC1 domains of type IV collagen were the generous gift of Dr. Rupert Timpl, Max Planck Institute, Martinsried, Germany. Laminin 5/6 was purified from collagenase-solubilized human amniotic membranes by antibody affinity chromatography using mAb K140-Sepharose as described (31Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of proteins visualized by rotary shadowing followed an established protocol (32Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Google Scholar). Thirty μl of recombinant NC1 protein dissolved in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were mixed with 3 ml of glycerol buffer (30% 0.2m ammonium bicarbonate and 70% glycerol) to provide a final concentration of 10 μg/ml protein. One hundred μl of solution were then placed onto a freshly separated mica sheet and sprayed using the sandwich technique. After drying, the samples were rotary shadowed in a Blazers 400 at an angle of −7° with 0.26 nm of platinum added to the surface. The samples were then coated with carbon at an angle of 90° for 13 s at 100 mA. The resulting carbon layer was then floated off into a dish filled with double distilled H2O and picked up with 300 mesh copper grids. Samples were then examined in a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope at 60 kV. The entire cDNA sequence coding for the NC1 domain of type VII collagen, including its own signal peptide sequence, was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV as shown in Fig.1 and used to transfect human 293 cells. A total of 18 individual G418-resistant cell clones were isolated and screened for secretion of NC1 in their conditioned media by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody directed against NC1. Production of the 145-kDa recombinant protein was detected in eight clonal cell lines (data not shown). Northern hybridization of the NC1 stably transfected 293 cell clones demonstrated abundant amounts of the 4-kb exogenous mRNA which is the size expected from the cDNA construct (Fig. 2). No hybridization, even after long exposure, was detected in the parental 293 cell, indicating very little or no production of endogenous type VII collagen in these cells. The recombinant NC1 was purified from serum-free culture medium that contained 15–20 μg/ml NC1. In serum-free culture medium, the recombinant product could be easily identified as a major 145-kDa band that was lacking in the parental 293 cells (Fig.3A, compare lane 1 and2). This band accounted for 20–30% of total secreted proteins. The ammonium sulfate precipitate of the conditioned medium proteins was then passed over a Q-Sepharose column. Most of the NC1 protein came out in the unbound fraction with a purity of approximately 90% (Fig. 3A, lane 3). NC1 was further purified to >95% electrophoretic homogeneity by molecular sieve Superdex-200 chromatography (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The purity of NC1 was demonstrated by the appearance of a single band on a silver-stained SDS-PAGE slab gel (lane 5). The final purified yield was 5–10 mg/liter culture medium. The purified recombinant NC1 and authentic NC1 prepared from the collagenase digestion of WISH cell-derived type VII collagen showed identical molecular mass by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3B). A similar result was obtained when recombinant NC1 was compared with authentic NC1 purified from human amnions (data not shown). When the purified recombinant NC1 was subjected to immunoblot analysis under nonreducing conditions, it appeared mainly as monomers of 145-kDa, dimers of about 290-kDa, and trimers of about 450-kDa (Fig.3C, lane 2). Under reducing conditions, however, all the dimers and trimers converted into monomers (Fig. 3C,lane 1). Quantitation of these species of NC1 using densitometry analysis showed approximately 60% as monomers, 30% as dimers, and 10% as trimers. The purified recombinant NC1 was also subjected to amino acid composition analysis and shown to be within the limits of analytical error of that predicted from the cDNA sequence (data not shown). Rotary shadowing of the recombinant NC1 revealed abundant amounts of what appeared as single arm NC1 species (monomers) (Fig.4A). Substantial amounts of NC1 also appeared to be configured as two arms (dimers) (Fig. 4B). Finally, a minority of the NC1 was configured into a structure whose image closely resembled the globular amino termini of type VII collagen consisting of three identical α chains held by disulfide bonds into trident-like structures (trimers) (Fig. 4C). It appears that the individual arms of NC1 are extended rod-like shaped structures under physiological conditions. Similar species of single-, two-, and three-armed structures have also been previously reported from rotary shadowing analysis of NC1 partially purified from human amnion (28Bachinger H.P. Morris N.P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Rosenbaum L.M. Compton L.A. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10095-10101Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the NC1 domain revealed three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (12Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20256-20262Google Scholar). To examine whether or not NC1 is indeed N-linked glycosylated, confluent NC1 stably transfected 293 cells were subjected to tunicamycin treatment. As shown in Fig. 5A, a lower molecular weight NC1 species was produced in the cells treated with tunicamycin in comparison with the untreated cells, indicating that the recombinant NC1 is N-linked glycosylated. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and2, tunicamycin treatment also significantly inhibited the secretion of the recombinant NC1 into the medium. Accordingly, larger amounts of NC1 accumulated inside the cells, as shown in Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4. Fig. 5A is a Coomassie Blue-stained slab gel of the proteins used in the subsequent Western blots (Fig. 5B) and demonstrates that the presence of tunicamycin in the 293 cell cultures (lane 2) selectively inhibits glycosylation and secretion of the 145-kDa NC1 band, whereas the other secreted proteins are not affected (compare lanes 1 and 2). This result suggests that total protein synthesis and secretion are not affected in these cells by the presence of tunicamycin. The tunicamycin-treated 293 cells were morphologically identical to the untreated 293 cells, and the cellular viability, as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion, was identical with or without the presence of tunicamycin (data not shown). Deglycosylation of the purified recombinant NC1 with peptideN-glycosidase F converted it to the lower molecular weight species, confirming that NC1 contains N-linked sugar chains (Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, when authentic NC1 purified from WISH cells (Fig. 5C,lanes 3 and 4) was subjected to the same enzyme treatment and analysis, the size difference between the deglycosylated and glycosylated forms of authentic NC1 was identical to recombinant NC1. These results suggest that authentic NC1 and recombinant NC1 have similar amounts of N-linked sugar content. Sequence analysis of the NC1 revealed the presence of multiple submodules with homology to adhesive proteins, suggesting that the NC1 domain may mediate interactions with lamina densa and dermal ECM proteins (12Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20256-20262Google Scholar, 18Christiano A.M. Rosenbaum L.M. Chung-Honet L.C. Parente M.G. Woodley D.T. Pan T.-C. Zhang R.Z. Chu M.-L. Burgeson R.E. Uitto J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 457-481Google Scholar). Previous solid phase interaction studies indicated that the NC1 domain of type VII collagen interacts with type IV collagen (22Burgeson R.E. Lunstrum G.P. Rokosova B. Rimberg C.S. Rosenbaum L.M. Keene D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 32-43Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of purified recombinant NC1 to bind to immobilized ECM components including type IV collagen (before and after pepsinization), the NC1 domain of type IV collagen, the 7 S domain of type IV collagen, type I collagen, type V collagen, laminin-1, the laminin 5/6 complex, and fibronectin using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (29Woodley D.T. Rao C.N. Hassell J.R. Liotta L.A. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 761: 278-283Google Scholar). To compare functionality between authentic and recombinant NC1, NC1 purified from amnion was also included in the binding assay. As shown in Fig. 6, NC1 binds to native type IV collagen and the NC1 domain of type IV collagen but does not bind to pepsinized type IV collagen or the 7 S domain of type IV collagen. These results were consistent with that of a previous study which suggested that the noncollagenous domain of type IV collagen is required for this interaction (22Burgeson R.E. Lunstrum G.P. Rokosova B. Rimberg C.S. Rosenbaum L.M. Keene D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 32-43Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that both recombinant NC1 and authentic NC1 also had affinity for fibronectin, the laminin 5/6 complex, and type I collagen. In contrast, little or no binding occurred with laminin-1 or type V collagen. No significant difference between the authentic NC1 and recombinant NC1 in terms of binding affinity for various ECM was noted. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7, the binding of the NC1 to collagens types I and IV, the laminin 5/6 complex, and fibronectin was specific, dose-dependent, and saturable.Figure 7Dose-dependent interaction of recombinant NC1 with type I and IV collagens, laminin 5/6, and fibronectin.

https://openalex.org/W2011186424,"A recently described protein module consisting of 35–40 semiconserved residues, termed the WW domain, has been identified in a number of diverse proteins including dystrophin and Yes-associated protein (YAP). Two putative ligands of YAP, termed WBP-1 and WBP-2, have been found previously to contain several short peptide regions consisting of PPPPY residues (PY motif) that mediate binding to the WW domain of YAP. Although the function(s) of the WW domain remain to be elucidated, these observations strongly support a role for the WW domain in protein-protein interactions. Here we report the isolation of three novel human cDNAs encoding a total of nine WW domains, using a newly developed approach termed COLT (cloningof ligand targets), in which the rapid cloning of modular protein domains is accomplished by screening cDNA expression libraries with specific peptide ligands. Two of the new genes identified appear to be members of a family of proteins, including Rsp5 and Nedd-4, which have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. In addition, we demonstrate that peptides corresponding to PY and PY-like motifs present in several known signaling or regulatory proteins, including RasGAP, AP-2, p53BP-2 (p53-bindingprotein-2), interleukin-6 receptor-α, chloride channel CLCN5, and epithelial sodium channel ENaC, can selectively bind to certain of these novel WW domains.

The recognition and elucidation in recent years of various modular protein domains, along with their specific peptide ligands, have spawned a remarkable progress in our understanding of their role in signal transduction and other fundamental cellular processes (1Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Google Scholar, 2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 560-573Google Scholar). Analysis of the SH (Src homology) domains, SH2 and SH3, present in a wide variety of proteins involved in cellular signaling and transformation has been particularly fruitful. The ligand specificity of many different SH2 and SH3 domains has been defined using combinatorial peptide libraries. SH2 domains bind with high affinity to phosphotyrosine residues within a specific sequence context (3Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofski S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chao M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar). In contrast, SH3 domains bind to proline-rich peptides that share a conserved PXXP motif (4Chen J.K. Lane W.S. Brauer A.W. Tanaka A. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem.

A newly described protein module, termed the WW domain, has been reported (6Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Google Scholar, 7André B. Springael J.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The WW domain consists of 35–40 amino acids and is characterized by four well conserved aromatic residues, two of which are tryptophan. The secondary structure of the WW domain has recently been determined and consists of a slightly bent three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (9Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M.

Although the precise physiological role of the WW domain remains undetermined, its presence in diverse proteins involved in signaling, regulatory, and cytoskeletal functions, as well as its rapidly emerging role in signaling mechanisms that underlie several human diseases, clearly underscores its importance (15Einbond A. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 1-8Google Scholar, 16Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Google Scholar). Two ligand proteins for the YAP WW domain, WBP-1 and WBP-2 (WW domain-bindingprotein), have recently been cloned and found to contain a run of prolines followed by a tyrosine residue (PY motif) that mediate specific binding to the YAP WW domain (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Google Scholar). It is likely that WW domains have distinct ligand specificities, as the PY motifs of WBP-1 and WBP-2 did not bind to the dystrophin WW domain. Furthermore, the PY motif appears to be distinct from the PXXP ligand consensus sequence of SH3 domains. These observations suggest a direct role for the WW domain in mediating specific and distinct protein-protein interactions. Yes-associated protein; glutathione S-transferase. Recently, we described a method termed COLT (cloningof ligand targets), which enables the rapid cloning of ligand-binding modular protein domains using peptide ligand sequences as probes for screening cDNA expression libraries (18Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Google Scholar). While COLT has been used to clone several novel SH3 domain-containing genes using proline-rich SH3 domain ligand peptides as probes, in this report, we describe its use in identifying three novel human WW domain-containing genes. In examining the ligand specificity of the individual WW domains, we demonstrate that they bind distinct PY motif peptide ligands with differential specificity and relative affinity. In addition, we demonstrate that peptides containing PY and PY-like motifs present in a variety of signaling or regulatory proteins can selectively bind to these novel WW domains. All peptides used were synthesized with an N-terminal biotin-SGSG linker and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and their structures were confirmed by mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. Multivalent peptide-streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase complexes were assembled as described (18Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Google Scholar) with the exception of the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide (pWBP-1), for which a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used (Sigma). Human bone marrow and brain λ cDNA libraries (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were plated at a density of ∼1 × 105 plaque-forming units/10-cm plate, and positive plaques were detected and purified as described previously (15Einbond A. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 1-8Google Scholar). Bound streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was detected with the IBI Enzygraphic™ Web (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) as described by the manufacturer. DNA was sequenced on both strands using ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle chemistry (Perkin-Elmer) on an ABI 373A automated DNA sequencer. Polymerase chain reaction fragments encoding individual WW domains were subcloned into the SalI and NotI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described by the manufacturer. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based cross-affinity experiments were performed essentially as described (5Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with 1–5 μg of fusion protein in 100 mm NaHCO3, blocked with SuperBlock Tris-buffered saline (Pierce), and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20. Specific peptide-streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase complexes were added as described above, and unbound complexes were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20. Following addition ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), peptide binding was quantitated after 30 min atA405 nm. Relative binding measurements from three independent determinations were assigned to a scale as follows:A units of 0–0.5 = (−), 0.5–1.0 = (+), 1.0–2.0 = (++), 2.0–3.0 = (+++), and > 3.0 = (++++). Peptide binding to full-length human Fyn and Lyn was assessed by a filter binding assay (5Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Google Scholar). Peptide sequences used in cross-affinity experiments correspond to segments of the following proteins: RasGAP (GenBank accession number P20936); the AP-2 transcription factor (P05549); p53BP-2 (p53-bindingprotein-2) (U09582); interleukin-2 receptor-γ (D11086); interleukin-6 receptor-α (P22272); voltage-gated chloride channel CLCN5 (X91906); Rous sarcoma virus Gag (D10652); human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Gag (D13784); β-dystroglycan (L19711); Formin (X53599); amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel ENaCα (P37089), ENaCβ (X87159), and ENaCγ (X87160); muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (P08173); and c-Abl (P00522). Src and Crk SH3-binding peptide sequences were derived from a phage display random peptide library screen (5Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Google Scholar). Protein sequence homology searches were performed using BLAST (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) and PROFILES (20Gribskov M. McLachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4355-4358Google Scholar) programs. In an effort to identify novel WW domain-containing proteins, four putative WW domain peptide ligand sequences including WBP-1 (PGTPPPPYTVGPGY), WBP-2A (YVQPPPPPYPGPM), WBP-2B (PGTPYPPPPEFY), and a PY peptide segment of RasGAP (GGGFPPLPPPPYLPPLG) were used as a mixed probe to screen human brain and bone marrow cDNA expression libraries by COLT. Thirteen positive clones were identified, including sibling and overlapping clones originating from the same mRNA. These clones were sequenced and found to encode three distinct proteins, WWP1, WWP2, and WWP3 (WW domain-containing protein), containing a total of nine novel WW domains (Fig. 1). Data base homology searches revealed that both WWP1 and WWP2 contain four tandem WW domains and share a similar modular domain architecture with Nedd-4 and Rsp5 (10Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14733-14741Google Scholar). The smaller partial clone, WWP3, was isolated from the brain cDNA library and contains a single WW domain. In addition to the high overall amino acid homology (55%), alignment of the nine novel WW domain sequences with several previously identified domains reveals two significant blocks of homology flanking the core of the domain (Fig. 2). These blocks include N-terminal tryptophan and C-terminal proline residues that are absolutely conserved in all WW domains identified to date. The WW domains of WWP1, WWP2, WWP3, Nedd-4, Rsp5, and YAP are more similar to each other than to WW domains found in other proteins (21Sudol M. Chen H.I. Bougeret C. Einbold A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Google Scholar). Furthermore, contrary to what one would expect from a recent evolutionary duplication event of the WW domain within a gene, individual WW domains from WWP1 and WWP2 show a greater similarity to the corresponding WW domains in either Nedd-4 or Rsp5 than to each other. The above observations suggest that these WW domains are perhaps functionally similar and that multiple WW domains within the same protein are not redundant but may have evolved to perform divergent specialized roles. Interestingly, we did not isolate a human YAP cDNA from these screens. However, murine YAP was detected in a screen of a mouse embryonic cDNA library with the WBP-2A peptide as a COLT probe. 2R. Gao and B. K. Kay, unpublished data. In addition to the WW domains, primary structure analysis of the clones revealed several other interesting features. Complete and partial C-terminal HECT (homologous to theE6-associated protein carboxylterminus) domains of ∼300 amino acids (Fig.3) are contained within clones WWP2 and WWP1, respectively. This domain has been shown in vitro to have E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in several proteins including rat p100, yeast Rsp5, and human papilloma virus E6-AP (22Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Google Scholar, 23Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Google Scholar). Encoded within the last 40 amino acids of the HECT domain is a conserved cysteine residue that is the likely site for ubiquitin thioester formation. The presence of a HECT domain is noteworthy since structurally and functionally related E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases are thought to serve a major role in defining the substrate specificity of the ubiquitin degradation system (24Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Google Scholar). In fact, Rsp5 was recently shown to be involved in the induced degradation of several nitrogen permeases in yeast (25Hein C. Springael J.-Y. Volland C. Haguenaur-Tsapis R. André B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Google Scholar). WWP2 also encodes an N-terminal C2-like domain characteristic of a large family of proteins including protein kinase C (26Kaibuchi K. Fukamoto Y. Oku N. Takai Y. Arai K. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13489-13496Google Scholar) and synaptotagamins (27Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Google Scholar). The C2 domain has been shown to bind membrane phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner and is thought to function in the intracellular compartmentalization of proteins (28Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Google Scholar). Although the different modular domains present within WWP1 and WWP2 are highly homologous to those found in Nedd-4 and Rsp5, there is no significant homology among these proteins in regions flanking these domains. Also of interest is the presence in clone WWP3 of a partial N-terminal guanylate kinase-like domain that is involved in GMP binding in several membrane-associated proteins including the human erythrocyte membrane protein p55 (29Ruff P. Speicher D.W. Husain-Chishti A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6595-6599Google Scholar) and rat postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 (30Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Google Scholar). To examine the peptide ligand binding preferences of all nine individual novel WW domains, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based cross-affinity map experiment was performed with each domain expressed as a GST fusion protein and WBP-derived peptides (Fig. 4). Peptides WBP-1, WBP-2A, and WBP-2C bound to several individual WW domains to varying degrees. The WBP-2B peptide with an N-terminal tyrosine residue relative to the run of prolines had no binding activity, indicating the necessity for a C-terminal tyrosine in the PY motif. The relative importance of individual proline residues within the PY motif for binding to various WW domains was assessed by alanine substitution for both the WBP-1 and WBP-2A peptides. All of the variant WBP-1 peptides, with the exception of the third proline substitution (WBP-1-Pro3), retained binding activity to WW domains present in clones WWP1 and WWP2, suggesting a critical role for the third proline residue. Interestingly, substitution of the second proline residue (WBP-1-Pro2) did not abolish binding to WW domains WWP1.1 and WWP2.3. This was unanticipated in light of the results observed for binding of the WBP-1 protein PY motif to the YAP WW domain, in which both the second and third proline residues are crucial for binding (9Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Google Scholar, 17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Google Scholar). This difference suggests that WW domains WWP1.1 and WWP2.3 possess a more promiscuous binding specificity than does the YAP WW domain. Similarly, proline substitution of the WBP-2A peptide indicates that the third proline residue (WBP-2A-Pro3) is absolutely essential for WW domain binding, whereas substitution of the second proline (WBP-2A-Pro2) is not. The specificity of individual WW domains for PY motif sequences was demonstrated by the ability to discriminate between peptides containing SH3 domain PXXP ligand consensus sequences (Src and Crk) as well as generally proline-rich control peptides derived from several proteins including acetylcholine receptor M4 and c-Abl. In addition, none of the PY motif peptides bound to either full-length Fyn or Lyn (which contain both SH3 and SH2 domains) in filter binding assays. Taken together, these results suggest that the PY motif represents a distinct binding sequence for WW domains. The presence of a critical tyrosine residue in the PY motif raised the question of whether tyrosine phosphorylation could modulate WW domain binding. Although it is not known whether PY motifs are phosphorylatedin vivo, the presence of a phosphotyrosine residue in the pWBP-1 peptide abolishes WW domain binding. Moreover, binding of the pWBP-1 peptide could be restored by removal of the phosphate moiety with prior treatment of either the free peptide or peptide bound to a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate with alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). These results suggest a potential regulatory role for tyrosine phosphorylation in modulating WW domain-ligand interactions. Data base searches revealed that PY and PY-like motif sequences are found in a wide variety of regulatory proteins. Included among these proteins are the GTPase-activating protein RasGAP, the AP-2 transcription factor, p53BP-2, renal chloride channel CLCN5, the dystrophin-interacting molecule β-dystroglycan, the interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-6 receptor-α, and the retroviral Gag proteins from human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and Rous sarcoma virus type 1 (30Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Google Scholar, 31Trahey M. Wong G. Halenbeck R. Rubenfeld B. Martin G.A. Ladner M. Long C.M. Crosier W.J. Watt K. Koths K. McCormick F.

Goodyer P. Rigden S.P.A. Wrong O. Jentsch T.J. Craig I.W. Thakker R.V. Nature. 1996; 379: 445-449Google Scholar). We tested the ability of peptides containing these motifs to bind to the novel WW domains (Fig. 5). Interestingly, although all of these peptides displayed an ability to bind WW domains in general, differences in specificity and relative binding were evident. For example, of all the peptides tested, only the CLCN5 peptide showed appreciable binding to the WWP1.4 and WWP2.4 domains. The observation that PY motif-containing peptides from several other proteins did not bind to any WW domain tested indicates that these interactions are specific and potentially biologically relevant (data not shown). Of particular note is the demonstration that the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and Rous sarcoma virus type 1 peptides derived from the Gag protein proline-rich “L domain” bound to several WW domains. L domain regions are highly conserved in retroviruses and have been shown to function in a positionally independent manner essential for retroviral budding (37Parent L.J. Bennett R.P. Craven R.C. Nelle T.D. Krishna N.K. Bowzard J.B. Wilson C.B. Puffer B.A. Montelaro R.C. Wills J.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5455-5460Google Scholar). Our results, coupled with a recent report demonstrating the interaction of the YAP WW domain with the L domain of Rous sarcoma virus (38Garnier L. Willis J.W. Verderame M.F. Sudol M. Nature. 1996; 381: 744-745Google Scholar), suggest a direct role for a WW domain(s)-Gag protein interaction in this process. The interaction of a β-dystroglycan peptide with several WW domains is also of interest. β-Dystroglycan, which contains a C-terminal PY motif, was previously shown to interact with the single WW domain present in dystrophin (15Einbond A. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 1-8Google Scholar). Our results suggest that perhaps several different WW domain-containing proteins can interact with the β-dystroglycan C-terminal PY motif. Recently, a 12-amino acid proline-rich region of Formin, a protein encoded by the mouselimb deformity locus (39Woychik R.P. Stewart T.A. Davis L.G. D'Eustachio P. Leder P. Nature. 1985; 318: 36-40Google Scholar), was shown to bind to both SH3 domain- and several novel WW domain-containing proteins (40Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Google Scholar). Significantly, a peptide encompassing the same proline-rich region of Formin did not bind to any of our novel WW domains. Since this peptide does not contain a PY motif, this suggests that our WW domains, unlike those present in the Formin-binding proteins, require a PY or PY-like motif for binding. Taken together, the above observations suggest that interactions between these proteins and WW domain-containing proteins may play a role in the former's regulation in vivo. For example, given the likelihood that WWP1 and WWP2 function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, one could invoke a simple model whereby initial substrate-specific recognition occurs via WW domain-substrate protein interaction followed by ubiquitin transfer and subsequent proteolysis. On a general level, the identification of WW domain PY motif ligand sequences in various candidate proteins can lead to testable predictions of specific WW domain-mediated interactions in vivo. The demonstration that peptides containing PY-like motifs derived from the cytoplasmic domains of both the wild-type β- and γ-subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaCβ-WT and ENaCγ-WT) bind to several WW domains is of particular interest (Fig. 6). Recently, a number of mutations in both ENaCβ and ENaCγ have been demonstrated in patients with an autosomal dominant form of hypertension characterized by elevated renal Na+reabsorption, termed Liddle syndrome (41Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson-Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill J.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Google Scholar). Specifically, several nonsense mutations leading to the truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of both subunits, in addition to two missense mutations (P616L and Y618H) contained within a conserved proline-rich segment of the cytoplasmic domain of the β-subunit, have been identified in patients (42Schild L. Canessa C.M. Schimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5699-5703Google Scholar, 43Hansson J.H. Schild L. Lu Y. Wilson T.A. Gautschi I. Schimkets R.A. Nelson-Williams C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11495-11499Google Scholar, 44Tamura H. Schild L. Enomoto N. Matsui N. Marumo F. Rossier B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1780-1784Google Scholar). Moreover, expressed proteins containing these mutations resulted in a 3–8-fold increase in ENaC activity that was directly related to an increase in the total number of active channels. These results suggest the hypothesis that specific cytoplasmic regions of the β- and γ-subunits are involved in the normal negative regulation of channel activity via interactions with a modulatory protein(s). In fact, Nedd-4 was recently identified as a binding partner with the C terminus of rat ENaCβ using the yeast two-hybrid system (45Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Google Scholar, 46Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently isolated WWP1 in COLT screens using ENaCβ and ENaCγ peptides (data not shown). Our observation that mutant peptides (ENaCβ-P616L and ENaCβ-Y618H) containing missense substitutions found in Liddle syndrome patients do not bind to the WW domains in clones WWP1 and WWP2 is consistent with the above hypothesis. This result also confirms the observation that the third proline residue and the tyrosine within the PY motif are critical for binding to the WW domain. Other substitutions of the β-subunit PY motif and flanking sequences were also shown to diminish binding to specific WW domains. Thus, substitution of the second proline residue of the core PY motif completely abrogated WW domain binding. In addition, mutation of specific residues flanking the C terminus of the PY motif also led to diminished WW domain binding. These results directly correlate with the activity of various ENaCβ mutants measured by a functional assay in Xenopus oocytes (47Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Google Scholar). A PY motif-containing peptide from the cytoplasmic domain of the wild-type α-subunit of ENaC (ENaCα-WT) was also shown to bind to several WW domains, suggesting that this subunit may also be regulated by a WW domain-mediated interaction(s). Taken together, the above observations suggest a mechanism whereby a WW domain-mediated interaction(s) of a Nedd-4 family member(s) leads to the eventual ubiquitin-mediated degradation and negative regulation of the Na+ channel. We have used the COLT approach to identify two new members (WWP1 and WWP2) of a family of human Nedd-4-like proteins associated with ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that individual WW domains of these proteins can clearly bind distinct PY motif peptide ligands with differential specificity and relative affinity. In addition to demonstrating the expanded utility of COLT methodology, it appears likely that additional proteins containing the modular WW domain remain to be found. In fact, we have recently isolated a third novel Nedd-4-like family member, containing three WW domains, from a human prostate cDNA library. 3A. J. Uveges and G. Pirozzi, unpublished data. Our results, coupled with knowledge of the NMR structure of the WW domain-ligand complex, provide a framework with which to examine the peptide ligand specificity and structure/function activity of individual WW domains. In this regard, optimal ligand preferences of the WW domains are currently being deduced by screening combinatorial phage display peptide libraries. 4J. Kasanov, G. Pirozzi, and B. K. Kay, unpublished data. Given the small size and high degree of sequence conservation of the WW domain, it is extraordinary that exquisite ligand selectivity is observed. The NMR structure of the human YAP WW domain and its peptide ligand reveals that the hydrophobic residues Leu-190, His-192, and Trp-199 (see Fig. 2) form a binding site in contact with the ligand (9Macias M.J. Hyvönen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Google Scholar). In light of these data, it is interesting to note that domains WWP1.4 and WWP2.4, which contain a C-terminal phenylalanine residue instead of a tryptophan, display a more restrictive ligand binding preference. In addition, the presence of a valine or isoleucine residue instead of Leu-190 may also play a role in determining the distinct ligand specificity of the novel WW domains. The presence of multiple WW domains with distinct ligand specificities in WWP1 and WWP2 suggests that these proteins may bind to a broad range of cellular targets. Alternatively, multiple WW domains may confer additive binding affinity to target molecules that contain multiple PY motif ligands. Finally, the interaction of peptides containing PY and PY-like motifs from several proteins with the WW domains in WWP1 and WWP2 directly suggests a role for the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of these proteins. In this respect, it is noteworthy that several cell membrane proteins, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (48Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Walsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Google Scholar) and yeast α-factor receptor Ste2p (49Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-288Google Scholar), are subject to ubiquitination and eventual degradation upon ligand binding. This is particularly relevant in light of the observed interaction of PY motif-containing peptides from ENaC subunits with specific WW domains and may lead to an understanding of the molecular pathology of Liddle syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2034536848,"Transcription factor PEBP2/CBF consists of a DNA binding subunit, α, and a regulatory subunit, β. The α subunit has an evolutionarily conserved 128-amino acid region termed “Runt domain” that is responsible for both DNA binding and heterodimerization with the β subunit. The Runt domain in all mammalian submembers of the α subunit contains two conserved cysteine residues, and its DNA binding activity undergoes redox regulation. To investigate the mechanism of this redox regulation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the two conserved cysteines in the Runt domain of the mouse PEBP2αA homolog. Substitution of Cys-115 to serine resulted in a partially impaired DNA binding, which remained highly sensitive to a thiol-oxidizing reagent, diamide. Conversely, the corresponding substitution of Cys-124 caused an increased DNA binding concomitant with an increased resistance to diamide. In contrast, substitution of either cysteine to aspartate was destructive to DNA binding to marked extents. These results have revealed that both Cys-115 and Cys-124 are responsible for the redox regulation in their own ways with low and high oxidizabilities, respectively. We have also found that two cellular thiol-reactive proteins, thioredoxin and Ref-1, work effectively and synergistically for activation of the Runt domain. Interestingly, the β subunit further enhanced the activation by these proteins and reciprocally prevented the oxidative inactivation by diamide. These findings collectively suggest the possibility that the Runt domain's function in vivo could be dynamically regulated by the redox mechanism with Trx, Ref-1, and the β subunit as key modulators.

Interestingly, the β subunit further enhanced the activation by these proteins and reciprocally prevented the oxidative inactivation by diamide. These findings collectively suggest the possibility that the Runt domain's function in vivo could be dynamically regulated by the redox mechanism with Trx, Ref-1, and the β subunit as key modulators.

Crute B.E. Melnikova I.N. Keller S.J. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3324-3339Google Scholar), is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of two different subunits, α and β. The α subunit binds directly to a specific DNA sequence, RACCRCA, while the β subunit does not by itself contact with DNA but facilitates the DNA binding activity of the α subunit through allosteric interactions (1Ogawa E.

Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3324-3339Google Scholar). The α subunit shares a 128-amino acid region of high homology with theDrosophila segmentation gene runt (3Kania M.A. Bonner A.S. Duffy J.B. Gergen J.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1701-1713Google Scholar) and the human AML1 gene (4Miyoshi H. Shimizu K. Kozu T. Maseki N. Kaneko Y. Ohki M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10431-10434Google Scholar). The conserved region, termed “Runt domain,” is responsible for both DNA binding and heterodimerization with the β subunit (5Kagoshima H. Shigesada K. Satake M. Ito Y. Miyoshi H. Ohki M. Pepling M. Gergen J.P. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 338-341Google Scholar, 6Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6859-6863Google Scholar), two additional members of the Runt family have subsequently been isolated in mice and humans: PEBP2αB (mouse homolog of AML1) (7Bae S.C. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Inuzuka M. Kagoshima H. Shigesada K. Satake M. Ito Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 809-814Google Scholar), and PEBP2αC (8Bae S.C. Takahashi E., W. Zhang Y. Ogawa E. Shigesada K. Namba Y.

Genomics. 1994; 23: 425-432Google Scholar). polyoma virus enhancer-binding protein thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase electrophoretic mobility shift assay dithiothreitol In mammals, PEBP2 has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of lymphoid cell-specific genes such as T-cell receptors, CD3, and myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors, interleukin-3, and granzyme B (for review, see Ref. 10Speck N.A. Stacy T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Exp. 1995; 5: 337-364Google Scholar). Chromosomal translocations involving the human AML1 gene, such as t(8;21), t(3;21), and t(12;21), lead to various types of leukemia including acute myeloid leukemia, the blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively (for review, see Refs. 10Speck N.A.

Moreover, an inversion in human chromosome 16 that gives rise to a fusion product, PEBP2β-SMMHC (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain), was also found to cause a M4Eo subtype acute myeloid leukemia (12Liu P.

Deursen J.V. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 321-330Google Scholar) as well as PEBP2/CBFβ (14Wang Q. Stacy T. Miller J.D. Lewis A.F. Gu T.-L. Huang X. Bushweller J.H.

Cell. 1996; 87: 697-708Google Scholar) have confirmed that these genes are essential for definitive hematopoiesis. Our previous functional characterization of PEBP2 (6Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Google Scholar) has revealed that the DNA binding activity of the Runt domain is subject to regulation by a reduction/oxidation-dependent mechanism (redox regulation). Since the finding of human thioredoxin/adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (15Yodoi J. Uchiyama T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 405-411Google Scholar), the importance of the thiol-mediated redox regulation has been well recognized in various biological responses (16Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 284: 13963-13966Google Scholar, 17Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Google Scholar). Particularly notable are accumulating examples of redox-responsive transcription factors, such as the AP-1 family (18Abate C. Patel L. Rausher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Google Scholar,19Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Google Scholar), the Rel family (20Toledano M.B. Leonard W.J. Proc.

Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Google Scholar), Myb (23Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Google Scholar), Ets-1 (24Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 221: 523-529Google Scholar), and p53 (25Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473Google Scholar). In these transcription factors, the reduced state of cysteine in the DNA-binding domain is essential for their DNA binding. Coincidentally, the Runt domain in all three mammalian submembers of the α subunit contain two cysteine residues that are perfectly conserved among them (8Bae S.C. Takahashi E., W. Zhang Y. Ogawa E. Shigesada K. Namba Y. Satake M. Ito Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 245-248Google Scholar). Our recent random mutagenesis study with the Runt domain of PEBP2αA (26Akamatsu Y. Tsukumo S. Kagoshima H. Tsurushita N. Shigesada K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 185: 111-117Google Scholar) has suggested that one target for its redox regulation should be Cys-124, because substitution of this residue to serine resulted in an enhanced DNA binding concomitant with decreased redox-dependence. However, the possibility remains that the other cysteine residue, Cys-115, could also be redox-responsive. To further define the potential roles of the two conserved cysteine residues in the redox regulation of PEBP2, we performed their site-directed mutagenesis and examined the DNA binding ability of resulting mutants under various redox conditions in vitro. Plasmid pQE-RD (6Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Google Scholar) encoding the Runt domain of PEBP2αA with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (for its structure, see Fig. 1A) was used as a vector for construction and overexpression of Runt domain mutants. Each or both of Cys-115 and Cys-124 were mutagenized to serine or aspartate by polymerase chain reactions using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) as described (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). The substitutions of the targeted residues were confirmed by sequencing. His-tagged derivatives of the Runt domain and the β subunit were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN) as described (6Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Google Scholar). Trx was purchased from Ajinomoto. TrxR was purified as described (28Kitaoka Y. Sorachi K. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Mitsui A. Kobayashi F. Mori T. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 41: 155-161Google Scholar). Ref-1 was purified as described (29Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Google Scholar). A DNA probe containing the wild type PEBP2 binding site was prepared as described (6Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Google Scholar). The DNA binding reaction was routinely carried out for 10 min at 25 °C in 10 μl of the EMSA buffer containing 20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 4% (w/v) Ficoll 400, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 6% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 10 fmol of32P-labeled probe, 5 ng of purified His-tagged Runt domain, and the β subunit (50 ng) where indicated. In some experiments, the Runt domain was pretreated with redox reagents such as diamide, DTT, Trx, and Ref-1. The reaction mixture was loaded on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 39:1) in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer and electrophoresed at room temperature. Gels were dried and visualized by a phosphorimager (Fujifilm BAS 2000) or autoradiography with x-ray films. The two conserved cysteine residues in the Runt domain of PEBP2αA to redox regulation were substituted to serine or aspartate, either separately or simultaneously (Fig.1A). In the following, the resultant mutants are denoted by abbreviations in the form XY, in which the first and second letters represent amino acids in one-letter codes that replace Cys-115 and Cys-124, respectively. All the serine mutants showed readily detectable DNA binding, although those with Cys-115 substituted to serine (SC and SS) were severalfold less active than the wild type (CC) in the absence of the β subunit (Fig. 1B,left panel; see also Fig. 1C for quantitative comparison). In confirmation of our previous observation (26Akamatsu Y. Tsukumo S. Kagoshima H. Tsurushita N. Shigesada K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 185: 111-117Google Scholar), mutant CS displayed stronger than normal DNA binding. On the other hand, the aspartate mutants invariably showed drastically impaired DNA binding, which was virtually undetectable in DC and DD, and barely recognizable in CD even after a prolonged exposure for autoradiography (Fig.1B, right panel). When the β subunit was present, the wild type and all the mutants with any recognizable DNA binding activity gave supershifted DNA bands, whose intensities, except for CS, were prominently increased over those observed without the β subunit. This indicates that substitution of either cysteine residue to serine or aspartate is tolerable for the heterodimerization between the Runt domain and the β subunit as well as their allosteric regulatory interaction. We then used the three serine mutants together with the wild type to evaluate the susceptibilities of the two cysteine residues to a thiol oxidizing reagent, diamide (Fig. 2A). Fig.2B shows changes in the relative DNA binding activity of these constructs after their treatment with increasing concentrations of diamide relative to the respective mock-treated controls. In the absence of the β subunit (open circles), SC remained nearly as sensitive as the wild type to diamide, showing more than 75% inhibition at 1 mm. In contrast, CS was only weakly affected (25% inhibition) at 1 mm. However, the activity of this mutant was progressively and extensively decreased with further increments of diamide up to 100 mm. Thus we conclude that Cys-115 is also responsive to redox regulation, although being much less sensitive than Cys-124. When the β subunit was present, all variants having one or both cysteine residues showed decreased sensitivities to diamide. CC and SC remained 90% active at 1 mm, although they became drastically inactivated at higher concentrations; CS was only moderately inhibited even at 100 mm. Thus, the β subunit appeared to render both Cys-115 and Cys-124 tolerable to proportionately increased dosages of diamide by one order of magnitude or more. No such β subunit-dependent protection was observed with the cysteine-less mutant, SS, as expected. In Fig. 2B are also indicated changes in the overall -fold stimulation of DNA binding by the β subunit with the diamide concentration for each Runt domain construct (crosses ondotted lines). Note first that SS showed moderate stimulation (severalfold), which is almost invariant with the diamide concentration and hence supposed to represent the redox-independent regulatory action of the β subunit in augmenting the intrinsic affinity of the Runt domain for DNA as previously defined by Kagoshimaet al. (6Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Google Scholar). By contrast, CC and SC exhibited much greater stimulation than SS, attaining a peak of 30-fold or more at 1 mm diamide. This enormous stimulation over that observed with SS is taken to reflect the above-noted anti-oxidation effect of the β subunit on Cys-124 as target. Although the -fold stimulation of CS was comparatively very low, it still showed a gradual rise with increasing concentrations of diamide, eventually surpassing that of SS at 100 mm. Evidently, therefore, Cys-115 is also subject to the protective action of the β subunit. We further addressed the question of what cellular component(s) could serve for reductive activation of the Runt domain. Three known factors were tested as candidates: glutathione (GSH), Trx/ADF, and Ref-1. Trx/ADF is known to activate transcription factor NF-κB under the cooperation with TrxR and NADPH (15Yodoi J. Uchiyama T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 405-411Google Scholar, 16Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 284: 13963-13966Google Scholar, 28Kitaoka Y. Sorachi K. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Mitsui A. Kobayashi F. Mori T. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 41: 155-161Google Scholar). Ref-1 (19Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Google Scholar) has been identified as a nuclear factor that stimulates the DNA binding activity of transcription factor AP-1. Ref-1, in turn, can be readily reduced by Trx (19Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, GSH was virtually inert in activating the Runt domain in the absence of the β subunit. When the β subunit was present, GSH showed moderate activation at low concentrations (1–10 μm: lanes 4 and 6), but it became inhibitory at 0.1 mm or above. In contrast, Trx consistently showed substantial activation at micromolar levels (Fig. 3B). Ref-1 was even more potent than Trx with still lesser concentrations (0.5–50 nm, Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the β subunit tended to stimulate the activation of the Runt domain by these proteins, particularly Ref-1 (Fig. 3C, even-numbered lanes). Possible mechanistic and regulatory implications of this effect will be given in “Discussion.” Furthermore, Trx and Ref-1 were found to act synergistically with each other. When preoxidized CC was incubated with either of them alone supplemented with a minimum amount of DTT to quench the residual diamide, no or only marginal DNA binding was observed. In combination, however, they restored the DNA binding as effectively as 100 mm DTT (compare lanes 2 and 5). The effect of Trx was also improved considerably by its co-incubation with TrxR and NADPH (lane 6). In the presence of this coupled reducing system, the supplementary DTT could be omitted with only a moderate reduction in DNA binding (lane 7), which was again fully restored by the addition of Ref-1 (lane 8). The present mutational study has demonstrated that both of the two cysteine residues within the Runt domain are responsible for redox regulation in their own ways, which are unique in comparison with known other redox-responsive transcription factors. Cys-124 apparently resembles the redox-responsive cysteine identified in Jun and Fos (18Abate C. Patel L. Rausher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Google Scholar) in its high oxidizability due to flanking basic amino acids (Fig.1A; see also Ref. 30Snyder G.H. Cennerazzo M.J. Karalis A.J. Field P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6509-6519Google Scholar) and augmented DNA binding by its substitution to serine. In Jun and Fos, conversion of cysteine to oxidation products of acidic nature is supposed to confer negative effects on DNA binding. A similar scenario would likely apply to Cys-124 in the Runt domain. Conversely, the lesser redox sensitivity of Cys-115 is likely attributable to the absence of any basic amino acid in its vicinity (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, the reduced DNA binding activity caused by its substitution to serine as well as aspartate suggests that the free sulfhydryl group per semight be functionally essential. Similar mutational effects have previously been reported for NF-κB (21Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.-L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Google Scholar), Myb (23Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Google Scholar), and Ets-1 (24Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 221: 523-529Google Scholar). Indeed, the x-ray structural analysis of NF-κB has demonstrated direct contacts of the free sulfhydryl group of cysteine with its target DNA (31Ghosh G. Van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Google Scholar). A priori, the two cysteines in the Runt domain might form a reversible disulfide bridge, as reported for p53 (25Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473Google Scholar). However, their differential redox susceptibilities as observed rather favor the view that the two cysteines undergo redox reactions independently from each other. Such a two-pronged mechanism would enable more flexible regulation of DNA binding in response to diverse cellular redox signals than otherwise. In extension of our previous observation (6Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Google Scholar), the results of this study also highlighted the potential significance of the β subunit as a modulator of redox sensitivity of the Runt domain, in addition to its role in allosterically enhancing the intrinsic DNA binding affinity of the Runt domain. The β subunit acted to protect both cysteines from oxidation by diamide. Puzzlingly, however, the β subunit did not hinder the access of the Runt domain by much larger molecules, Trx and Ref-1. How then was the β subunit able to block the action of diamide? We infer that the intrinsic oxidizability of these cysteine residues could be modulated by β subunit-induced alterations in the local environment around them in terms of their spatial alignment with neighboring charged amino acids or their involvement in intra- or inter-molecular hydrogen bonding, rather than a simple steric hindrance. The finding that Trx and Ref-1 can efficiently activate the Runt domain in a manner synergistic with each other and enforceable by the β subunit raises the question of where and how these protein factors interact with each other within the cell. While the α subunit is a nuclear protein, the β subunit by itself is localized in the cytoplasm and transported to the nucleus through association with the α subunit (32Lu J. Maruyama M. Satake M. Bae S.C. Ogawa E. Kagoshima H. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1651-1661Google Scholar). Available evidence (6Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Google Scholar, 32Lu J. Maruyama M. Satake M. Bae S.C. Ogawa E. Kagoshima H. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1651-1661Google Scholar) has suggested that the heteromeric interaction of the β subunit with the intact α subunit is somewhat restricted both in vitro and in vivoby a putative intramolecular interference between the Runt domain and its flanking regions and that a specific mechanism would exist to promote this heterodimerization. Likewise, Ref-1 is a nuclear protein (19Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Google Scholar), whereas Trx is normally localized in the cytoplasm but is mobilized into the nucleus upon exposure of cells to various chemical and physical stimuli such as phorbol ester and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (33Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; : 94Google Scholar). The expression of Trx also can be strongly induced by various oxidative stresses (34Sachi Y. Hirota K. Masutani H. Toda K. Okamoto T. Takigawa M. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 44: 189-193Google Scholar). In the light of these observations, it is tempting to speculate that the DNA binding activity of PEBP2 would be regulated by dynamic nuclear trafficking of the β subunit and Trx in response to oxidative stresses. While this work was in progress, in vivo evidence underscoring the functional importance of cysteine residues in the Runt domain protein was provided by the report (35Kurokawa M. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16870-16876Google Scholar) that the transactivation and cell-transforming potentials of AML1/PEBP2αB were markedly weakened by substitution of serine for Cys-72 (corresponding to Cys-115 in PEBP2αA). To further delineate the dynamics and significance of redox regulation of PEBP2 to their full extents, it should be informative to extend such functional studies using a wider variety of mutants as constructed here in combination with various conditions affecting the cellular redox state. Worth noting finally is the pattern of evolutionary conservation of cysteine in the Runt domain proteins. This protein family has been identified in a wide range of animal species from Caenorhabditis elegans (deduced from the C. elegans genomic data base) 2H. Kagoshima and T. Bürglin, personal communication. to mammals, and shown thus far to contain at least three subclasses in mammals (8Bae S.C. Takahashi E., W. Zhang Y. Ogawa E. Shigesada K. Namba Y. Satake M. Ito Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 245-248Google Scholar, 9Levanon D. Negreanu V. Bernstein Y. Bar-Am I. Avivi L. Groner Y. Genomics. 1994; 23: 425-432Google Scholar, 10Speck N.A. Stacy T. Crit. Rev.

Karlovich C.A. Dumstrei K. Banerjee U. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1194-1205Google Scholar)). As indicated in Fig.4, all the members identified in species classified todeuterostomia including sea urchin (37Coffman J.A. Kirchhamer C.V. Harrington M.G. Davidson E.H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 43-54Google Scholar), chicken (38Castagnola P. Gennari M. Gaggero A. Rossi F. Daga A. Corsetti M.T. Calabi F. Cancedda R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 215-226Google Scholar), and mammals (8Bae S.C. Takahashi E., W. Zhang Y. Ogawa E. Shigesada K. Namba Y. Satake M. Ito Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 245-248Google Scholar, 9Levanon D. Negreanu V. Bernstein Y. Bar-Am I. Avivi L. Groner Y. Genomics. 1994; 23: 425-432Google Scholar, 10Speck N.A. Stacy T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Exp. 1995; 5: 337-364Google Scholar) share the two conserved cysteine residues at positions 115 and 124. On the other hand, those found in Drosophilaand C. elegans, which belong to protostomia, have one or both of these cysteines altered to serine or tyrosine. Discernible also is an opposite change from cysteine to serine at position 157 in an apparent association with the advent of vertebrate. It thus seems that there were a number of possible ways in utilizing cysteine to control DNA binding by the Runt domain and nature had shifted its choices among them at major steps of evolutionary divergence in the animal kingdom. Further comparative studies of the Runt domain proteins are awaited to explore the potential evolutionary implications of its redox regulation in full scope.

https://openalex.org/W2042216100,"We previously reported the isolation of cDNAs encoding two mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)kinase kinases, designated MEKK2 and MEKK3 (Blank, J.L., Gerwins, P., Elliott, E.M., Sather, S. and Johnson, G.L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 5361–5368). In the present study, cotransfection experiments were used to examine the regulation by MEKK2 and MEKK3 of the dual specificityMAP kinase kinases, MKK3 and MKK4. MKK3 specifically phosphorylates and activates p38, whereas MKK4 phosphorylates and activates both p38 and JNK. Coexpression of MEKK2 or MEKK3 with MKK4 in COS-7 cells resulted in activation of MKK4, as assessed by enhanced autophosphorylation and by its ability to phosphorylate and activate recombinant JNK1 or p38 in vitro. MKK3 autophosphorylation and activation of p38 was also observed following coexpression of MKK3 with MEKK3, but not with MEKK2. Consistent with these observations, immunoprecipitated MEKK2 directly activated recombinant MKK4 in vitro but failed to activate MKK3. The sites of activating phosphorylation in MKK3 and MKK4 were identified within kinase subdomains VII and VIII. Replacement of Ser189 or Thr193 in MKK3 with Ala abolished autophosphorylation and activation of MKK3 by MEKK3. Analogous mutations in MKK4 indicated that Ser221 and, to a lesser extent, Thr225 were necessary for MKK4 activation by MEKK2 and MEKK3.These data indicate that MKK3 is preferentially activated by MEKK3, whereas MKK4 is activated both by MEKK2 and MEKK3. Consistent with these observations, MEKK2 and MEKK3 also activated JNK1 in vivo. However, MEKK3 failed to activate p38 when coexpressed in either the absence or presence of MKK3, indicating that MEKK3 is not coupled to p38 activation in vivo. These observations suggest that regulation of p38 and JNK1 pathways by MEKK3 may involve distinct mechanisms to prevent p38 activation but to allow JNK1 activation. We previously reported the isolation of cDNAs encoding two mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)kinase kinases, designated MEKK2 and MEKK3 (Blank, J.L., Gerwins, P., Elliott, E.M., Sather, S. and Johnson, G.L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 5361–5368). In the present study, cotransfection experiments were used to examine the regulation by MEKK2 and MEKK3 of the dual specificityMAP kinase kinases, MKK3 and MKK4. MKK3 specifically phosphorylates and activates p38, whereas MKK4 phosphorylates and activates both p38 and JNK. Coexpression of MEKK2 or MEKK3 with MKK4 in COS-7 cells resulted in activation of MKK4, as assessed by enhanced autophosphorylation and by its ability to phosphorylate and activate recombinant JNK1 or p38 in vitro. MKK3 autophosphorylation and activation of p38 was also observed following coexpression of MKK3 with MEKK3, but not with MEKK2. Consistent with these observations, immunoprecipitated MEKK2 directly activated recombinant MKK4 in vitro but failed to activate MKK3. The sites of activating phosphorylation in MKK3 and MKK4 were identified within kinase subdomains VII and VIII. Replacement of Ser189 or Thr193 in MKK3 with Ala abolished autophosphorylation and activation of MKK3 by MEKK3. Analogous mutations in MKK4 indicated that Ser221 and, to a lesser extent, Thr225 were necessary for MKK4 activation by MEKK2 and MEKK3. These data indicate that MKK3 is preferentially activated by MEKK3, whereas MKK4 is activated both by MEKK2 and MEKK3. Consistent with these observations, MEKK2 and MEKK3 also activated JNK1 in vivo. However, MEKK3 failed to activate p38 when coexpressed in either the absence or presence of MKK3, indicating that MEKK3 is not coupled to p38 activation in vivo. These observations suggest that regulation of p38 and JNK1 pathways by MEKK3 may involve distinct mechanisms to prevent p38 activation but to allow JNK1 activation.

In NIH3T3 cells, expression of inducible MEKK1 catalytic domain results in maximal JNK activation in the absence of detectable ERK stimulation (48Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), suggesting that MEKK1 may preferentially regulate the JNK pathway. Current evidence suggests that MEKK2 and MEKK3 show little or no preference for activating either JNK or ERK pathways (49Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of MEKK activation are unknown, MEKK activities have been implicated in MAPK pathways regulated by a number of extracellular stimuli in several cell types. For example, an endogenous MEKK1 is activated in epidermal growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells via a pathway involving Ras (54Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). MEKK1 is also activated in mast cells following aggregation of high affinity IgE receptors (55Ishizuka T.

Johnson G.L. Riches D.W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using a kinase-deficient MEKK1 mutant, evidence for MEKK1 involvement in tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB activation in NIH3T3 cells has also been reported (57Hirano M. Osada S. Aoki T. Hirai S. Hosaka M. Inoue J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13234-13238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Another serine/threonine kinase shown to activate MKK4 in vitro is the MEKK-related TAK-1 enzyme, which is activated in murine osteoblast cells following transforming growth factor-β stimulation (58Yamaguchi K.

TAK-1 has also recently been shown to activate MKK3 and MKK6 in vitro and in vivo (35Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K.

A fifth MEKK homologue, designated Tpl-2, has also recently been shown to activate the ERK and JNK pathways in vivo and to directly phosphorylate MEK1 and MKK4 in vitro (59Salmerón A. Ahmad T.B. Carlile G.W. Pappin D. Narsimhan R.P. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The JNK activator MKK4 can also activate p38 in vivo and directly phosphorylate and activate p38 in vitro (32Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

It is surprising, therefore, that MEKK1 and MEKK2, which directly phosphorylate and activate MKK4, fail to activate p38 in vivo (37Lin A. Minden A. Marinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C.

Among the presumed substrates for these kinases, adaptor proteins, which juxtapose effector enzyme systems with the antigen receptor complex, figure prominently. Previous studies suggested that Lnk, a 38-kDa protein consisting of a single SH2 domain and a region containing potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, might serve to join Grb2, phospholipase C-γ1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the TCR. To elucidate the physiological roles of Lnk in T cell signal transduction, we isolated the mouse Lnk cDNA, characterized the structure of the mouseLnkgene, and generated transgenic mice that overproduce Lnk in thymocytes. Here we report that although Lnk becomes phosphorylated during T cell activation, it plays no limiting role in the TCR signaling process. Moreover, we have distinguished p38Lnk from the more prominent 36-kDa tyrosine phosphoproteins that appear in activated T cells.

In part, this process remains mysterious because of an incomplete appreciation of the total set of enzymes that associate with, and respond to Lck, Fyn, and ZAP-70 as they interact with the TCR complex.

Among the substrates that become rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine following T cell stimulation is a set of so-called adaptor proteins, molecules which lack catalytic function (insofar as is known) but which possess interaction domains, e.g. SH2 domains that bind tightly to phosphotyrosine residues or SH3 domains that bind proline-rich sequences (18Birge R.B. Knudsen B.S. Besser D. Hanafusa H. Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Google Scholar). An appreciation for the importance of these proteins derives from studies of growth factor receptor kinases, where initial binding and phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor creates a binding site for a second adaptor, Grb2, that then directs Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to the membrane where it can act upon Ras (19Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Google Scholar, 20Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Google Scholar). In a similar way, the adaptor proteins of T cells, by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated components of the TCR, should serve to juxtapose other SH2 domain-containing proteins with the TCR, thereby regulating the interaction of downstream signaling pathways with the ligand-engaged receptor. A thorough enumeration of the normal complement of adaptor proteins, and an analysis of how these proteins behave, should therefore help to illuminate mechanisms of signal transduction in lymphoid cells. Lymphocytes themselves contain Shc, which becomes phosphorylated and binds both TCR subunits and the Grb2-Sos complex following TCR stimulation (21Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Google Scholar). Although several observations support the view that Shc may help to link Grb2 and perhaps other proteins to the TCR complex, the importance of this interaction remains controversial, in part because only a small proportion of total cellular Grb2 binds to phosphorylated Shc after TCR stimulation (22Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Google Scholar, 23Osman N. Lucas S.C. Turner H. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13981-13986Google Scholar). SLP-76 (SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) contains many tyrosine-phosphorylation sites, an SH2 domain, and a proline-rich region that may interact with SH3-containing proteins (24Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Google Scholar). TCR ligation stimulates SLP-76 phosphorylation, and augmented expression of SLP-76 in the Jurkat cell line improves the nuclear translocation of the NFAT transcription factor (a key regulatory event in IL-2 expression) following TCR cross-linking (25Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Google Scholar). Moreover, SLP-76 has been shown to bind to the Vav oncoprotein, a putative exchange factor for Rho/Rac GTP-binding proteins (26Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Google Scholar), which is also phosphorylated by protein tyrosine kinases upon TCR stimulation. Coexpression of SLP-76 with Vav in Jurkat cells produces synergistic increases in NFAT activation following TCR stimulation (27Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Google Scholar). Yet another adaptor protein, the 120-kDa product of the cbl gene, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following TCR activation and thereafter associates with a variety of signaling molecules including Crk, Grb2, Fyn, Lck, ZAP-70, Ras-GAP, PLC-γ1, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (28Meisner H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8435-8442Google Scholar). While the significance of these interactions remains obscure, the documented transforming ability of v-cbl, in which normalcbl-encoded sequences are partially truncated, supports the view that this molecule plays an active role in TCR-mediated signal transduction (35Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Google Scholar). A fourth presumed adaptor protein, HS1, which was recently shown to behave as an Lck-binding protein (36Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Li Z. Strong-Sparks W.J. Hashimoto Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3403-3414Google Scholar), contains an SH3 domain and also becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following antigen receptor cross-linking (37Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa S. Toyoshima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Google Scholar, 38Taniuchi I. Kitamura D. Maekawa Y. Fukuda T. Kishi H. Watanabe T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3664-3678Google Scholar). T lymphocytes from mice lacking HS1 exhibit impaired proliferative responses and a disturbance in normal repertoire selection (38Taniuchi I. Kitamura D. Maekawa Y. Fukuda T. Kishi H. Watanabe T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3664-3678Google Scholar). At a minimum, then, the adaptor proteins Shc, Grb2, SLP-76, Cbl, and HS1 all behave as molecules that may link activation of kinase components of the T cell antigen receptor complex to subsequent biochemical responses. One prominent substrate of the TCR-activated protein tyrosine kinase(s) is a 36–38-kDa protein (pp36) that associates with the SH2 domains of numerous signaling molecules, including Grb2, PLC-γ1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, GAP, and the Src family kinases (22Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Google Scholar,39Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Google Scholar). Although other phosphoproteins, notably Shc, have been shown to associate with the Grb2 SH2 domain, pp36 is the predominant species that binds the SH2 domain of Grb2 in anti-TCR-stimulated T lymphocytes. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of pp36 correlates well with inositol phosphate production, a measure of PLC-γ1 activity (43Motto D.G. Musci M.A. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2823-2829Google Scholar). Transfection of a chimeric CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase containing the Grb2 SH2 domain into Jurkat T lymphoblasts yielded cells in which TCR stimulation failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of pp36, while phosphorylation of other proteins remained intact (43Motto D.G. Musci M.A. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2823-2829Google Scholar). These results were interpreted to suggest that phosphorylated pp36, once bound to the chimeric Grb2/CD45 protein, became rapidly dephosphorylated. Interestingly, inositol phosphate production and calcium mobilization were compromised in the transfected cells, further suggesting a role for pp36 in coupling the TCR to phosphoinositide metabolism. Efforts have therefore focused on biochemical characterization of pp36. Recently, cDNA clones encoding a 38-kDa molecule called Lnk, which shares many properties with pp36, were isolated (44Huang X. Li Y. Tanaka K. Moore K.G. Hayashi J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11618-11622Google Scholar). Lnk consists of a single SH2 domain juxtaposed with a sequence of unknown function in which are embedded potential tyrosine-phosphorylation sites. In an initial report, Lnk expression was documented in lymphoid tissues and the Lnk protein was shown to become tyrosine phosphorylated after TCR cross-linking. Intriguingly, phosphorylated Lnk appeared to interact (as judged by coimmunoprecipitation) with Grb2, PLC-γ1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These observations suggested that Lnk was in fact the pp36 protein, the phosphorylation of which correlates so well with phosphoinositide turnover (43Motto D.G. Musci M.A. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2823-2829Google Scholar, 44Huang X. Li Y. Tanaka K. Moore K.G. Hayashi J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11618-11622Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Lnk in TCR signal transduction and in T cell development, we have characterized the structure of mouse Lnk, the gene that encodes it, and its expression in various tissues and lymphocyte subsets. In addition, we generated transgenic mice expressing Lnk at very high levels in thymocytes. These studies demonstrate that the availability of Lnk protein does not restrict normal T cell development or responsiveness. Thymocytes from transgenic mice proliferated normally and showed an equivalent pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins when compared with normal thymocytes stimulated via TCR cross-linking. By studying the behavior of proteins bound by GST-Grb2 fusion proteins, and by anti-Lnk heteroantisera, we learned that pp36 and Lnk are distinct entities, although both become phosphorylated during T cell activation. Thus Lnk represents a novel adaptor protein expressed in lymphocytes, which almost certainly interacts with phosphoproteins other than those that comprise the T cell antigen receptor. A mouse Lnk cDNA fragment was amplified from thymocyte cDNA by PCR using the following primers, which were synthesized based on the published rat Lnk cDNA sequence: forward (FWD) primer: 5′-TCACTTCCTGTCCTGCTACCCCTG, reverse (REV) primer: 5′-GCACAGCTGTGAGAGAGGGGTGTA. The cDNA fragment was labeled using the random-primer method with [α-32P]dATP (DuPont NEN), and used as a probe to screen a library previously constructed with mouse thymocyte cDNA in the λZAP II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by plaque hybridization. Five positive plaques were isolated from 1 × 106 plaques screened, and phage DNAs were excisedin vivo to rescue phagemids containing the cDNA fragment. The DNA sequences of these clones were determined using the dideoxy chain termination method employing Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Genomic clones were isolated from a λFIX II library of 129SV liver DNA partially digested with MboI (Stratagene) using [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA fragments as probes. A total of 1 × 106 plaques were screened and 28 positive plaques were isolated. Five independent clones of these were expanded and each NotI restriction fragment was subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene). Physical maps of subcloned plasmids were determined by restriction enzyme digestion, Southern blotting, PCR, and DNA sequencing. The cDNA fragments encoding the N-terminal domain (Lnk-N: amino acids 1–96), and the C-terminal domain (Lnk-C: amino acids 197–307) of mouse Lnk, and the bulk of mouse Grb2 (amino acids 2–217) were synthesized by PCR using the followingBamHI site-containing primers: Lnk-N FWD, 5′-AAGGATCCATGCCTGACAACCTCTACACC; Lnk-N REV, 5′-ATGGATCCTAGGGGTAGCAGGATAGGAAG; Lnk-C FWD, 5′-TTGGATCCGTCCTCTCTCAGGCACCAG; Lnk-C REV, 5′-TAGGATCCATTCACACGTCTGCCTCT; Grb2 FWD, 5′-TTGGATCCGAAGCCATCGCCAAATATGAC; Grb2 REV, 5′-ATGGATCCTTAGACGTTCCGGTTCACTGG. PCR fragments were inserted into theBamHI cloning site of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the resulting plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant proteins were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified by adsorption to glutathione-coupled Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia). Purified GST-Grb2 fusion proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (154 mm NaCl, 10 mm PO4, pH 7.4) and conjugated to activated Affi-Gel-10 agarose (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against a synthetic peptide spanning amino acids 281–309 of mouse Lnk, or against the GST-Lnk fusion proteins. The antibodies were purified by chromatography on Affi-Gel-10 conjugated with either the synthetic peptide, GST-Lnk-N, or GST-Lnk-C fusion protein, followed by elution using 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. Antibodies against GST were absorbed from sera against GST-Lnk fusion proteins using GST-coupled glutathione-Sepharose-4B. Affinity-purified antibodies to GST-Lnk fusion proteins were coupled to Affi-Gel-10, and used for immunoprecipitation studies. Antibodies against the Lnk peptide were used for immunoblotting. Flow cytometry was performed by staining 106 freshly isolated thymocytes and splenocytes from 5–7-week-old mice (45Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Chien S. Nada S. Bartelmez S.H. Okada M. Aizawa S. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 463-473Google Scholar) using the following reagents: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-coupled anti-CD8 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD4 (Pharmingen), FITC-anti-B220 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), PE- or biotin-conjugated anti-CD3ε (Pharmingen), biotin-anti-CD69 (Pharmingen), PE- or TRI-COLOR-conjugated streptoavidin (Caltag). Cells were analyzed with a FACScan instrument (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) using Lysis II (Becton-Dickinson) and Reproman software (Truefacts Software, Seattle, WA). To obtain purified lymphocyte subpopulations, a single-cell suspension of thymocytes from 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice was stained with FITC-anti-CD8 and PE-anti-CD4, and splenocytes were stained with FITC-anti-B220 and PE-anti-CD3ε. Purified CD4−8−, CD4+8+, CD4+8−, and CD4−8+thymocytes, or B220+ and CD3+ splenocytes were obtained using a FACStar (Becton-Dickinson) cell sorter. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from mouse tissues using the Micro-Fast Track kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), fractionated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham). These membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA fragments encoding mouse Lnk (amino acids 36–268) or mouse β-actin (amino acids 160–375). For quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from purified cells using the Micro-Fast Track kit, and first strand cDNA template was synthesized using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) with random primers. Serial dilutions of these cDNA templates were subjected to PCR amplification using sets of primers spanning several introns of Lnk (FWD primer, 5′-ATGCCTGACAACCTCTACAC; REV primer, 5′-ATTCACACGTCTGCCTCTCT) or β-actin (FWD primer, 5′-ACACTGTGCCCATCTACGAG; REV primer, 5′-CTAGAAGCACTTGCGGTGCA). Cycling parameters were 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 64 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C for 34 cycles to detect Lnk mRNA, and 27 cycles for β-actin. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Southern blot filters of C57BL/6J × Mus spretus backcross DNA panels digested with HindIII were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The filters were hybridized with a 32P-labeled 2-kb BglII-BamHI fragment of the Lnkgene containing exon 1. The probe detected a restriction fragment length polymorphism, previously defined using test digestions, that distinguishes C57BL/6J mice from the M. spretus strain (a 10.5-kb fragment in C57BL/6J DNA, and 8-kb and 2.5-kb fragments inM. spretus DNA, respectively). The results of these hybridizations were scored blindly, and forwarded to the Jackson Laboratory Backcross DNA Panel Map Service, which used these data to position the Lnk gene. Baculovirally expressed murine p56lck was prepared as described (46Watts J.D. Wilson G.M. Ettehadieh E. Clark-Lewis I. Kubanek C.-A. Astell C.R. Marth J.D. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 901-907Google Scholar). High Five cells containing baculovirally expressed affinity-tagged ZAP-70 (47Isakov N. Wange R.L. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15753-15761Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. L. E. Samelson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). ZAP-70 was isolated via immunoprecipitation with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the Myc affinity tag, as described elsewhere (48Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GST-Lnk-N with recombinant p56lck and 9E10 precipitates of ZAP-70 was performed for 1 h at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 μm ATP with [γ-32P]ATP added to 4400 dpm/pmol. Phosphoproteins were separated, and unreacted [γ-32P]ATP removed, by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphoproteins of interest were identified by autoradiography. Tryptic digestion was performed on the membrane. The resulting peptides were separated on two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps and then subjected to IMAC (immobilized metal affinity chromatography)-HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography)-ESI (electrospray ionization)-MS (mass spectrometry) analysis as described elsewhere (48Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Google Scholar) with the following modification: the second dimension ascending chromatography buffer for the two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was 55:45:40:9, butan-1-ol, pyridine, water, acetic acid (v/v/v/v). The DNA sequences surrounding the initiation codon of the mouse Lnk cDNA were modified by PCR to provide a better consensus sequence (49Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Google Scholar) using the following two primers: FWD primer (containing a BamHI site), 5′-AAGGATCCACCATGCCTGACAACCTCTACACC, and the Lnk-N REV primer. ABamHI-SacI fragment of the modified cDNA was used to replace a SacI fragment containing the initiation codon of the original Lnk cDNA. The Lnk transgene was produced by ligation of the combined Lnk cDNA (containing 8 base pairs of modified 5′-untranslated region, the entire coding region and 50 base pairs of 3′-untranslated region) into the BamHI cloning site of the p1017 vector (50Chaffin K.E. Beals C.R. Wilkie T.M. Forbush K.A. Simon M.I. Perlmutter R.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3821-3829Google Scholar), which consists of the murine lckproximal promoter and a human growth hormone gene cassette. The Lnk transgene, purified as a NotI fragment, was injected into (C57BL/6J × DBA/2J) F2 mouse zygote pronuclei as described previously (51Garvin A.M. Abraham K.M. Forbush K.A. Farr A.G. Davison B.L. Perlmutter R.M. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 173-180Google Scholar). Transgenic founders were detected by hybridization of genomic DNA with an human growth hormone probe, and stable lines of mice were generated by backcrossing founders with C57BL/6J mice. Thymocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3ε (2C11) and anti-CD4 (GK1.5) mAbs in combination with anti-rat IgG (Sigma) and anti-hamster IgG (Sigma) secondary antibodies as described previously (21Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Google Scholar). Following stimulation, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation. The lysates were incubated with agarose beads conjugated with anti-Lnk-N and anti-Lnk-C antibodies or GST-Grb2 at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. Lysates of 2 × 106 cells, or precipitated proteins from lysates of 4 × 107 cells were resolved by SDS-12.5% PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schull). After blocking with 5% skim milk/phosphate-buffered saline, blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), or anti-Lnk peptide antibodies, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel, Durham, NC). Filters were washed in 0.05% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN). To pursue the importance of Lnk in immune physiology, we determined the structure of mouse Lnk, thereby providing entree to the set of immunological reagents available in this species. A full-length cDNA encoding mouse Lnk was isolated from a thymocyte cDNA library and its nucleotide sequence determined using standard techniques. Not surprisingly, Lnk is well conserved between mouse and rat. The mouse Lnk cDNA sequence is 95% identical with that of rat (data not shown; the mouse Lnk cDNA sequence is available through GenBank, accession number U89992). The deduced amino acid sequences of mouse and rat Lnk share 96% identity and 98% similarity overall, with complete identity within the SH2 domain (Fig. 1 A). Possible tyrosine-phosphorylation sites suggested in this paper (see below) and by Huang et al. (44Huang X. Li Y. Tanaka K. Moore K.G. Hayashi J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11618-11622Google Scholar) are also perfectly conserved. By comparing the Lnk amino acid sequence with the GenBank data base (translated in all possible reading frames), we identified several proteins with significant similarities to either the N-terminal domain of Lnk or to its SH2 domain (Fig. 1 B). Among these, the recently characterized SH2-B protein, which was isolated in a yeast “tribrid” screen by virtue of its ability to bind the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of the FcεRIγ subunit (52Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Google Scholar), was especially similar. Although no functional data have yet been reported regarding SH2-B, simple structural comparison suggests that Lnk might also interact with phosphorylated ITAM-like motifs to link signal-transducing molecules to cell surface receptors. Besides SH2-B, the Lnk SH2 domain also appears related to those of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase corkscrew, the adaptor proteins Shc and Nck, and the protein-tyrosine kinases Srm and Abl. RNA blotting was performed to characterize the tissue distribution of the Lnk mRNA (Fig.2 A). Two transcripts of 5 and 3 kb were strongly expressed in spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow, and found at low levels in thymus. A fair amount of Lnk mRNA was also detected in lung, liver, and kidney. Lnk has been reported to be expressed preferentially in lymphocytes (44Huang X. Li Y. Tanaka K. Moore K.G. Hayashi J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11618-11622Google Scholar); however, the level of transcript accumulation in lung and liver is consistent with the existence of other populations of Lnk-expressing cells in those organs. To assess the pattern of Lnk expression during lymphocyte development, we purified thymocyte subpopulations based on their discrete patterns of CD4 and CD8 expression (Fig. 2 B). CD4−8−, CD4+8+, CD4+8−, and CD4−8+thymocytes were purified by sorting, and expression of Lnk in each subpopulation was analyzed using a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR approach. The PCR primers employed in amplification spanned five introns of the mouse Lnk gene (see below), and hence the products amplified from cDNA (1.0-kb) could be easily distinguished from those arising through amplification of contaminating genomic DNA (1.6-kb). In each case, the amount of template cDNA present was normalized between sam"

Cross-linking sites at the amino acid and nucleotide level were determined by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). MALDI-MS analysis performed subsequent to a partial alkaline hydrolysis of cross-linked peptide-oligoribonucleotide complexes allowed for the first time the cross-linked rRNA moiety to be sequenced by this technique. In this manner Lys-44 in S4 was determined to be cross-linked to the oligoribonucleotide at positions 1531–1542 on the 16 S RNA (whereby either U-1541 or A-1542 is the actual cross-link site), Lys-75 in S7 to positions 1374–1379 (C-1378 cross-linked), Met-114 in S7 to 1234–1241 (U-1240 cross-linked), Lys-55 in S8 to 651–654 (U-653 cross-linked), and Lys-29 in S17 to 629–633 (U-632 cross-linked). The novel approach applied here promises to be useful for similar studies on other known protein·RNA complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2064218500,"Treatment of intact erythrocytes with 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS) causes irreversible inhibition and chemical labeling of the lactate transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) (Poole, R. C., and Halestrap, A. P. (1992) Biochem. J. 283, 855–862). In rat eythrocytes DIDS also causes cross-linking of MCT1 to another protein in the membrane to give a product of 130 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cross-linking is markedly reduced by those compounds that protect against irreversible inhibition of lactate transport by DIDS and enhanced by imposition of a pH gradient across the plasma membrane to recruit the substrate binding site of MCT1 to an exofacial conformation. These data indicate that DIDS cross-linking is via the same site on MCT1 as is responsible for inhibition of transport. Antibodies raised against the cross-linked conjugate react with proteins of approximately 40 kDa (MCT1) and 70 kDa on Western blots of erythrocyte membranes and an additional band of 130 kDa after treatment of erythrocytes with 100 μm DIDS. The 70-kDa protein that is cross-linked to MCT1 was purified and shown to containN-linked carbohydrate; the apparent core molecular mass is 40 kDa. Amino acid sequencing showed that the protein is the rat equivalent of the membrane-spanning mouse teratocarcinoma glycoprotein GP-70, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily related to basigin (Ozawa, M., Huang, R.

MCT1 is widely distributed in mammalian cells, and has been well characterized at the functional (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Google Scholar, 7Carpenter L.

J. 1996; 320: 817-824Google Scholar), especially in erythrocytes (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Google Scholar, 8Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Google Scholar). It is inhibited by a variety of stilbene disulfonates, such as 4,4′-dibenzamidostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DBDS) and 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS), which bind in competition with substrates and some other inhibitors of transport (9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 307-312Google Scholar). DIDS has two isothiocyanate groups that are reactive toward susceptible amino groups, and with prolonged incubation these cause irreversible inhibition and chemical labeling of the transporter (9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 307-312Google Scholar, 10Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 855-862Google Scholar). The two isothiocyanate groups of DIDS give it the potential to cross-link MCT1 with closely associated membrane proteins. Indeed, SDS-PAGE of rat erythrocyte ghosts prepared from cells preincubated with DIDS revealed a protein band of approximately 130 kDa that might be such a cross-linked product (10Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 855-862Google Scholar). Here we show that this 130-kDa band is the result of a highly specific DIDS-mediated cross-linking of MCT1 to a glycoprotein of approximately 70 kDa. Internal sequencing of the protein shows that is is the rat equivalent of the mouse teratocarcinoma glycoprotein, GP-70, which is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily related to basigin (11Ozawa M. Huang R.-P. Furukawa T. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3059-3062Google Scholar). Cross-linking appears to occur via a site at or in communication with the substrate binding site of MCT1 and might play a role in regulating MCT1 activity. monocarboxylate transporter; α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate; octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether; 4,4′-dibenzamidostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl]-propionate; transmembrane; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from the sources given previously (8Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Google Scholar, 9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem.

Anti-peptide antibodies to various regions of MCT1 were raised and purified as described elsewhere (8Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were collected in a citrate buffer (84 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). Cells were then usually washed once in a bicarbonate-buffered saline buffer (121 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2), and then at least twice more in citrate buffer before resuspending in the same buffer to 10% hematocrit and adjusting the pH to 7.4. Incubations with DIDS, removal of nonbound inhibitor, and preparation of ghost membranes were performed as described previously (10Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 855-862Google Scholar). Proteolytic digestion of red cell ghosts and separation of membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE were performed as described elsewhere (8Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Google Scholar). Rat erythrocyte membranes, prepared from cells treated with 100 μm DIDS, were subjected to chromatography on aminoethyl-Sepharose, essentially as described previously (12Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 755-759Google Scholar). Elution of the cross-linked product of 130 kDa was monitored both by Western blotting with anti-MCT1 antibodies, and by silver staining of protein. The peak fractions containing the cross-linked product (which co-eluted with free MCT1) were concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Amicon, Centriprep 10) and separated on a 6% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel, and the protein was located with copper staining (13Lee C. Levin A. Branton D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 308-312Google Scholar). The band of 130 kDa was excised, destained, and then electroeluted as described below. This preparation was used to immunize a New Zealand White rabbit, as described previously (8Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Google Scholar). The membrane protein of approximately 70 kDa that is cross-linked to MCT1 upon incubation of rat erythrocytes with DIDS was shown to co-elute with MCT1 on ion-exchange fractionation (Q-Sepharose). Thus membranes (from either control or 5 μm DIDS-treated erythrocytes) were stripped of peripheral membrane proteins and solubilized with 1% (w/v) C12E8 at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, prior to batch purification using Q-Sepharose (10Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 855-862Google Scholar). Nonbound protein was removed by washing with buffer containing 0.5% C12E8, and a 0.2 m NaCl eluate was prepared by mixing the washed matrix with an equal volume of buffer containing 0.5% C12E8 and 0.4 mNaCl. The eluate was concentrated by centrifugal filtration to 2 ml, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. A broad band at approximately 70 kDa (identified by staining with Coomassie Blue) was electroeluted overnight in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% SDS (w/v), pH 8.0, before concentrating to 1.5 ml by centrifugal filtration. C12E8 was added to 1% (v/v), and the protein was incubated with N-glycanase F (400 Oxford Glycosystems units/ml) for at least 2 h, and usually overnight. The sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, where the deglycosylated binding protein migrated at approximately 40 kDa. Direct N-terminal microsequencing was performed after transfer onto a ProBlot membrane and staining with Serva Blue G (12Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 755-759Google Scholar). Alternatively, the polyacrylamide gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the 40-kDa band was excised, electroeluted overnight, and concentrated by centrifugal filtration. After addition of C12E8 (1% (v/v) in a final volume of 200 μl), a 50-μl aliquot was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 0.2 μg of Lys-C, and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE using a Tricine buffer system able to separate small peptides (14Schagger H. von Jaggow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Peptides were transferred onto ProBlot membrane and stained with Serva Blue G to reveal discrete bands of about 11 and 3.5 kDa. These were cut out for N-terminal microsequencing. The data of Fig. 1 show that the 130-kDa band formed following incubation of rat erythrocytes with 100 μm DIDS is recognized by specific anti-MCT1 antibodies. It is of note that this cross-linking is highly specific; normally no other additional bands were detected upon treatment with DIDS. These observations indicate that the cross-linking is probably a reflection of a close association of the two proteins in the erythrocyte membrane, which may in turn be of functional relevance. Since DIDS is membrane impermeant, the binding protein must be either a membrane-spanning protein or an exofacial peripheral protein. It could be argued that the new MCT-containing band is a result of cross-linking MCT1 to itself, forming oligomers. This seems unlikely for several reasons. First, 130 kDa is not a simple multiple of 40 kDa (especially as trimer formation seems unlikely), and second, the products of self-aggregation of MCT1 do not seem to co-migrate with the cross-linked product as is also shown in Fig. 1. Aggregation was induced by solubilizing rat erythrocyte membranes with the detergent C12E8 (1% w/v) and leaving on ice for varying periods of time before separating on SDS-PAGE and probing Western blots with anti-MCT1 antibodies. There was a time-dependent aggregation of MCT1 to produce a product of approximately 80 kDa, which corresponds to a dimer of MCT1. Such aggregation phenomena are common with membrane proteins (15Furthmayr H. Marchesi V.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1137-1144Google Scholar, 16Jhun B.H. Berenski C.J. Craik J.D. Paterson A.R. Jung C.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 149-155Google Scholar). To investigate more fully the cross-linking reaction, we performed the labeling reaction in the absence and presence of various inhibitors of MCT1 activity. DBDS and CHC, two potent inhibitors of lactate transport that also inhibit labeling of MCT1 by DIDS (9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 307-312Google Scholar, 10Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 855-862Google Scholar), reduced markedly the DIDS-induced cross-linking of MCT1, whereas the poor inhibitor 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DNDS) (9Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 307-312Google Scholar) had little effect (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the cross-linking of MCT1 is via a site on the transporter that is either at the substrate binding site, consistent with competitive inhibition of lactate transport by DIDS, or affected by conformational changes induced by substrate or inhibitor binding. In Fig. 3 we show that the cross-linking reaction is dependent upon the nature of the buffer used for the reaction. The reaction was performed in either a citrate buffer, pH 7.4, which induces a large pH gradient (0.6–0.8 pH unit, alkaline inside) or a saline buffer, also at pH 7.4, in which there is very little gradient (approximately 0.2 pH unit, acid inside) (17Edlund G.L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 117-126Google Scholar). It is clear that in citrate buffer the rate of cross-linking of MCT1 is more rapid and the extent is greater. This result might be expected since an alkaline-inside pH gradient would be predicted to cause recruitment of an outward-facing binding site of the transporter, according to the accepted kinetic model for the carrier in which proton binding precedes monocarboxylate binding (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Google Scholar). Thus the empty carrier will preferentially take up the conformation in which the substrate binding site is exposed to the face of the membrane at which the proton concentration is highest. The inhibitor then binds and traps the carrier in this conformation. This model is supported by the observation that the Ki for inhibition of lactate transport by the reversibly binding stilbene disulfonate DBDS is lower in citrate than in saline buffer (results not shown). Such data provide further evidence that the cross-linking occurs at or near the external substrate binding site.Figure 3Time course of formation of DIDS cross-linked MCT1 conjugate in citrate and saline media. The protocol was the same as for Fig. 2, but incubation with 100 μm DIDS was performed for the time shown in either citrate medium (see “Methods”) or saline medium (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cross-linking reaction can also be used to locate the region of MCT1 containing the DIDS-labeled lysine residue, by investigation of the fragments produced upon proteolysis of MCT1. Using a series of anti-peptide antibodies, we have characterized the pattern of cleavage by several proteases and used this information to derive information on the topology of the protein with respect to the membrane (8Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Google Scholar). Rat MCT1 has only 5 lysine residues predicted to be extracellular in location, and these are the most likely targets for labeling by DIDS. Two of these lysine residues are within a well characterized N-terminal fragment, and the remaining three in fragments reactive with antibodies raised against the TM7/8 and TM11/12 loops. Thus, if the binding protein is linked to either of these fragments by DIDS, there should be additional immunoreactve fragments derived from proteolytic digestion. Data demonstrating this are shown in Fig. 4. Trypsin digests MCT1 quantitatively to yield a fragment of approximately 20 kDa that reacts with the TM11/12 antibody. Upon digestion of membranes from DIDS-pretreated erythrocytes, additional antibody reactive bands of approximately 100 and 35 kDa were detected. These data indicate that DIDS reacts with a lysine in the C-terminal half of the protein, which, following trypsin cleavage, remains conjugated to the binding protein (100 kDa) or a proteolytically cleaved fragment of it (35 kDa). Membranes from DIDS-treated erythrocytes were treated with N-glycanase F, which resulted in an apparent reduction in molecular mass of the binding protein on SDS-PAGE, to approximately 100 kDa (Fig. 5). Since MCT1 is not glycosylated (6Carpenter L. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 157-163Google Scholar), this must reflect N-linked glycosylation of the binding protein. Antibodies raised against the MCT1-binding protein conjugate, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” recognized two proteins on Western blots of control erythrocyte membranes. These were a weak band at 40 kDa that reacted with antibodies against MCT1 (not shown) and a stronger band at 70 kDa, which is likely to represent the unconjugated binding protein (Fig.6). In membranes prepared from cells pretreated with 100 μm DIDS, these bands were still detected, but an additional band at 130 kDa was detected that presumably represents the DIDS cross-linked MCT1 conjugate to which the antibody was raised.Figure 6Western blots of control and DIDS-treated erythrocyte membrane proteins probed with an antibody against the DIDS cross-linked MCT1-conjugate protein. Control erythrocytes and those treated with 100 μm DIDS were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described for Fig. 2. Subsequent Western blotting was performed with an antibody against the DIDS-cross-linked MCT1-conjugate protein raised as described under “Methods.” Parallel Western blots using control serum showed no specific bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We attempted to purify the putative 70-kDa binding protein by replacing DIDS as cross-linker with the cleavable membrane impermeant cross-linking reagent 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl]-propionate (DTSSP). Preliminary experiments showed that erythrocytes incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 mm DTSSP gave a 130-kDa cross-linked product that reacted with MCT1 antibody on Western blots. Partial purification of this protein was performed on aminoethyl-Sepharose and SDS-PAGE, followed by electroelution of the 130-kDa band as described for the DIDS-labeled conjugate under “Methods.” Cleavage of the eluted protein was achieved by incubation with β-mercaptoethanol (5% v/v) for 45 min, and the cleaved products were separated by SDS-PAGE. A broad band of about 70 kDa was obtained, but N-terminal sequencing showed it to contain more than one polypeptide. Thus we attempted to purify the native binding protein. Western blotting with the antibody raised against the 130-kDa MCT1-binding protein conjugate showed that the 70-kDa putative binding protein eluted from Q-Sepharose at a similar salt concentration to MCT1 (0.2 m NaCl in batch elution experiments). The eluted protein fraction was further purified by SDS-PAGE, and a broad band around 70 kDa, presumably composed of a number of polypeptides, was electroeluted and then subjected to treatment withN-glycanase F. The 70-kDa band, now free of MCT1, was clearly detected with the antibody, and treatment withN-glycanase F reduced its apparent molecular mass to 42 kDa. Silver staining of these fractions revealed the 42-kDa band to be a major component of the deglycosylated samples as shown in Fig.7. The core (deglycosylated) protein prepared in this manner was subjected to N-terminal microsequencing, but no sequence was obtained. Thus it was digested with the protease Lys-C, and the resulting peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE before transferring to ProBlot membrane for N-terminal microsequencing. Two peptides were visible of approximately 12 and 3.5 kDa, but only the 3.5-kDa peptide gave a good sequence of 15 amino acids (MGDTLYNQYRFTVFN). This sequence was used in a BLAST search of the protein sequence data bases via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and was found to have a strong identity to an internal sequence of mouse teratocarcinoma glycoprotein GP-70 (SWISS-PROT accession no. P21995) as shown in Fig.8. This 70-kDa glycoprotein is a cell surface member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that has a developmentally regulated carbohydrate moiety (11Ozawa M. Huang R.-P. Furukawa T. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3059-3062Google Scholar). It deglycosylates to yield a core protein with a mobility on SDS-PAGE corresponding to about 40 kDa; the true molecular weight being 37,102. Thus it is probable that our MCT1-binding protein is the rat equivalent of mouse GP-70, or a closely related protein. The identity is further strengthened by the presence of a lysine on the N-terminal side of the methionine of the GP-70 peptide, since our peptide was derived by Lys-C cleavage.Figure 8Comparison of some partial amino acid sequence of the MCT1-binding protein with the mouse and rat GP-70 sequences. The top sequence represents amino acids 122–136 of the mouse membrane teratocarcinoma glycoprotein GP-70 (SWISS-PROT accession no. P21995). The middle sequencecorresponds to that obtained from N-terminal microsequencing a 3.5-kDa peptide derived from Lys-C digestion of the purified and deglycosylated MCT1-binding protein as described in the text. The K at the N terminus is assumed in view of the specificity of the protease. Thelower sequence is derived from translation of a rat EST sequence (EMBL accession no. H32724) that was identified by searching the EST data base with the GP-70 sequence as described in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Confirmation that the MCT1-binding protein is the rat equivalent of the mouse GP-70 was obtained by searching the EST data base with the GP-70 nucleotide sequence. Two closely related EST sequences were identified (EMBL accession nos. H32620 and H32724) of which only the latter corresponded to the coding region of mouse GP-70. Fortunately this 276-base pair EST fragment encoded the region of the protein corresponding to the peptide we had sequenced. The translated sequence (in the third reading frame) is shown in Fig. 8 and agrees with our experimentally determined sequence in all but one residue. The incorrect residue was a Ser which we determined as an Asn. This is a common sequencing error since the two amino acids eluted with very similar retention times, but it may also be the result of a single base sequencing error in the EST sequence. The data presented here demonstrate that DIDS can cross-link MCT1 to a 70-kDa glycoprotein in rat erythrocyte membranes via an externally disposed amino acid side chain. This protein is likely to be the rat equivalent of mouse teratocarcinoma glycoprotein GP-70, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Since DIDS is an affinity label that binds in competition with substrates and inhibitors of MCT1, it is likely that cross-linking occurs at the substrate binding site. However, it is possible that binding occurs at a distant site whose conformation and thus affinity for DIDS is affected by substrate binding. Close apposition of GP-70 to the substrate binding site of MCT1 raises the possibility that this interaction may have an effect on the kinetic/functional properties of MCT1. In cardiac myocytes two functionally distinct monocarboxylate transporters have been detected (18Wang X.M. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Levi A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 249-258Google Scholar, 19Wang X.M. Levi A.J. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1759-H1769Google Scholar, 20Wang X. Levi A.J. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H476-H484Google Scholar), and neither of them have properties that correspond exactly to those of MCT1. However, there is a high level of expression of MCT1 in the intercalated disk region of the myocyte (2Kim Garcia C. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 865-873Google Scholar). 2X. Wang and A. P. Halestrap, unpublished data. Such apparently contradictory observations may be reconciled if the absence or presence of a regulatory protein in different cells could change the functional properties of MCT1."

https://openalex.org/W2036802237,"Haptoglobin (HP) is one of the major acute phase plasma proteins in the mouse, and its synthesis is additively induced by interleukin (IL)-6 and glucocorticoids. STAT3 serves as the mediator of the IL-6 receptor signal and appears to contribute to the transcriptional induction of acute phase protein genes. The carboxyl-terminal region of STAT3, consisting of an acidic domain and containing a serine phosphorylation site, has been proposed to contribute to the induction process. To assess the role of STAT3 in the transcriptional control of the HP promoter, we applied two mutant forms of STAT3: one with a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 55 amino acid residues, STAT3Δ55C, and the other with a substitution of serine 727 to alanine, STAT3SA. Like the wild-type STAT3, both mutant STAT3 forms are activated by the signal-transducing subunit of the IL-6 receptor, gp130, or by co-transfected IL-3 receptor. Ectopic expression and activation of wild-type STAT3 or STAT3SA in HepG2 hepatoma cells similarly enhance transcription through the IL-6-response element of the HP promoter. This enhancement is specific for STAT3 and cannot be reproduced by STAT1 or STAT5. In contrast, STAT3Δ55C inhibits IL-6-induced transcriptional activation. Interestingly, whereas receptor-activated STAT3 also enhances stimulation of the haptoglobin promoter by dexamethasone through the glucocorticoid receptor, activated STAT3Δ55C reduces the regulation below the level achieved by the glucocorticoid receptor alone. This transdominant action by STAT3Δ55C is dependent on a functional IL-6-responsive element. The data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domain, but not its serine phosphorylation site of STAT3, is required for transcription as part of the hematopoietin receptor signaling as well as for cooperation with other transcription factors such as the glucocorticoid receptor.

Acute phase response is elicited by the various forms of inflammatory condition, tissue injury, and infection (1Kushner I. Mackiewicz A. Mackiewicz A. Kushner I. Baumann H. Acute Phase Proteins: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 4-19Google Scholar). The recruitment of the systemic defense mechanisms is initiated by many cell types at the site of local inflammation and includes macrophages, mast cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells and involves the production, release, and distribution of several cytokines. A major component of the systemic acute phase response is the enhanced production of several plasma proteins in the liver that are collectively called acute phase plasma proteins (APPs) 1The abbreviations used are:APPacute phase plasma protein;HPhaptoglobin;ILinterleukin;IL-6RIL-6 receptor;IL-3RIL-3 receptor;bpbase pair;GRglucocorticoid receptor;C/EBPCAAT/enhancer-binding protein;GCSFgranulocyte colony-stimulating factor;GCSFRGCSF receptor;CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase;EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay;IL-6REinterleukin 6 response element;MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinase;PEA-3polyomavirus enhancer activator-3;SIEsis-inducible element;SIFsis-inducible factor. (1Kushner I. Mackiewicz A. Mackiewicz A. Kushner I. Baumann H. Acute Phase Proteins: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 4-19Google Scholar). In most vertebrate species, haptoglobin (HP) is one of the core sets of APPs, and its synthesis is generally increased severalfold. In the mouse, the increase is 30-fold and exceptionally high (2Pajovic S. Jones V.E. Prowse K.R. Berger F.G. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2215-2224Google Scholar). HP functions as a hemoglobin-binding protein and is most effective in clearing free hemoglobin from the circulation (3Bowman B.H. Kurosky A. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1982; 12: 189-261Google Scholar). IL-6 is the major inducer of the hepatic production of most APPs, whereas IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α act only on a subset of APPs (4Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids or dexamethasone enhance the production of many APPs through yet-to-be defined mechanisms. The mouse HP gene is an example of APPs that are strongly induced by both IL-6 and dexamethasone (2Pajovic S. Jones V.E. Prowse K.R. Berger F.G. Baumann H. J. Biol.

Signaling by the IL-6 receptor is mediated by the signal-transducing common subunit gp130 through Janus kinases associated with the cytoplasmic domain containing the Box-1 and Box-2 motifs (5Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Google Scholar). Following phosphorylation on the tyrosine residue in the Box-3 motifs of gp130, STAT3 is recruited to the gp130 and is activated by receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs) through phosphorylation (6Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulous G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Google Scholar). Activated STAT3 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to specific DNA sequences (7Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Google Scholar). The interaction of STAT3 with specificcis-acting elements has been correlated with enhanced transcription of the responsive target genes including APPs (8Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14847-14850Google Scholar). Recent analyses have suggested that additional modifications of STAT3 protein alter its function as a transcriptional activator. Phosphorylation on serine 727 has been shown to enhance DNA binding affinity and activation of transcription (10Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S.

Although characterization of STAT3 has indicated structural domains relevant for gene induction, the action of critical STAT3 mutant forms, in the context of an IL-6-sensitive gene promoter, has not been described. The promoter of the mouse HP gene has been selected as a model to define the relevance of the carboxyl-terminal peptide and the serine 727 phosphorylation site for regulation by IL-6R and other hematopoietin receptors in hepatic cells. Previously, we have found that the 237-bp HP promoter containscis-acting elements for mediating induction by IL-6 and dexamethasone, and includes two C/EBP binding sites (“A” element at positions −213 to −198 and “C” element at −137 to −123), the IL-6 response element (IL-6RE) (“B” element at positions −165 to −152), and the PEA-3 binding site (at positions −110 to −87) (see Fig. 6 A; Ref. 2Pajovic S. Jones V.E. Prowse K.R. Berger F.G. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2215-2224Google Scholar). Although no glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding site could be identified in the mouse HP promoter, the dexamethasone response appears to be dependent on the presence of the GR and requires the cytokine response region at positions −184 to −106 of the HP promoter (2Pajovic S. Jones V.E. Prowse K.R. Berger F.G. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2215-2224Google Scholar).

DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Google Scholar). This method yielded 2.5 ± 5.6% (n = 12) of transfected cells in the culture as judged from in situ staining for the expression of the transfection marker β-galactosidase. The standard plasmid mixtures contained a final concentration of 20–25 μg/ml and included 2 μg of pIE-MUP as an internal marker (25Prowse K.R. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 42-51Google Scholar). After a 24-h recovery, cells were treated with the cytokines for 24 h, and serial dilutions of cell extracts were used to measure CAT activity within the linear range of the assay. Conversion of chloramphenicol to acetylated products was determined. The values were normalized to the expression of the co-transfected major urinary protein (25Prowse K.R. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 42-51Google Scholar) and calculated relative to the untreated control (defined as 1.0). Mean ± S.D. of at least three independently performed experimental series are reproduced in the figures. An aliquot of the whole cell extracts containing 5 μg of protein was used for EMSA. The double-stranded, high affinity sis-inducible element SIEm67 (23Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Google Scholar) served as binding substrate for STAT1 and STAT3, and TB2 served as substrate for STAT5 (26Morella K.K. Lai C. Kumaki S. Kumaki N. Wang Y. Bluman E.M. Witthuhn B.S. Ihle J.N. Giri J. Gearing D.P. Cosman D. Ziegler S.F. Tweardy D.J. Campos S.P. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8298-8310Google Scholar). From the same whole cell extracts, aliquots containing 30 μg were also separated on 6 or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and were reacted with anti-STAT1 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-STAT3 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal STAT3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), STAT5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or phosphotyrosine 705-specific anti-STAT3 (New England Biolabs). Similarly, total cell lysates (30 μg) were analyzed with anti-human GCSFR (Springville Laboratories, RPCI). Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Corp.). Whole cell extracts from COS-1 cells transiently expressing STAT3 or STAT3SA served as substrates for the MAPK reaction. Twenty μg of whole cell protein in a total of 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, and 50 mm NaF) were incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μl of activated MAPK-agarose conjugate (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by removing the MAPK beads by brief centrifugation. STAT3 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant fraction with STAT3 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for autoradiography and Western analysis. To characterize the role of STAT3 in the regulation of mouse HP gene elements, we constructed two key mutant forms of STAT3: STAT3SA with a mutation of the serine 725 to alanine at its carboxyl-terminal kinase substrate site, and STAT3Δ55C with a truncation of the acidic carboxyl-terminal fragment as observed in STAT3β (12Shaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Google Scholar, 13Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Google Scholar) but lacking the latter's additional 7 residues encoded by the extra exon sequence. We verified the expression of the STAT proteins by transiently transfecting COS-1 cells (Fig.1 A). Western blot analysis (bottom part, mAb) demonstrated that each STAT form was produced in approximately equal amounts, yielding levels that exceeded severalfold that of the endogenous STAT3 (Fig. 1 A,Ctrl). The major portion of the immunodetectable STAT proteins migrated with the expected sizes. However, a minor fraction of STAT3wt and STAT3SA migrated with an approximately 5000 smaller molecular size. These forms probably represent proteolytically modified STAT3 proteins (see similar forms detected in HepG2 cell extracts; Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Effect of STAT proteins on gene induction through the HP promoter. A, HepG2 cells were transfected with a combination of expression vectors for GCSFR-gp130(133) (5 μg/ml), the indicated STAT proteins (10 μg/ml), and empty expression vector to a total of 20 μg/ml. In this experiment, rat STAT1β instead of STAT1α was used for easier detection of the transfected protein in the presence of the relatively abundant endogenous STAT1. After 1 day of recovery, cells were divided in 6-well plates. The cells were treated with IL-6 (Vector Control) or GCSF for 15 min. One part of the collected cells was dissolved directly in SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis of GCSFR-gp130 (only cytokine-treated cells), and the remaining part was used for preparing whole cell extract. Aliquots containing 5 and 30 μg of protein were used for EMSA and Western analysis, respectively. For EMSA, SIE (all lanesexcept last lane) or TB2 (last lane with STAT5B) served as binding substrate. For STAT protein Western analyses, extracts were electrophoresed in quadruplicate, and proteins on the nitrocellulose membrane were reacted with the indicated antibodies.B, for detecting CAT gene regulation, HepG2 cells were transfected with a similar combination of plasmids as in A, consisting of the reporter mHP(237)-CAT (15 μg/ml) and expression vector for GCSFR-gp130(133) (1 μg/ml) and indicated STAT proteins (5 μg/ml). In this case, rat STAT1α was used. After 1 day of recovery, the cell cultures were divided and treated for 24 h with the indicated cytokine or dexamethasone. The thin layer pattern of one reaction is shown. The -fold stimulation measured in this experimental series is indicated above the autoradiogram. C, HepG2 cells were transfected with a 15 μg/ml of mHP(237)-CAT (upper panel) or mHP(IL-6RE)-CAT (lower panel) and the increasing amounts of expression vector for STAT3, STAT3SA, or STAT3Δ55C as marked. The DNA amount in each transfection was adjusted to a total of 25 μg/ml with pUC13 DNA. Cells were treated with IL-6 for 24 h, and CAT activities were determined. All values are expressed relative to control culture without IL-6 treatment and STAT3 transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The activation of the transfected STAT proteins by gp130 signals, was demonstrated by the co-transfected chimeric receptor, GCSFR-gp130(133). This receptor consists of the extracellular domain of the human GCSFR fused to the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain of 133 residues of human gp130. The chimeric receptor is considered to undergo a GCSF-dependent dimerization that also includes the cytoplasmic gp130 domains. An analogous dimerization process has been predicted for the bona fide ligand-activated IL-6R (27Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K. Hammacher A. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23286-23289Google Scholar, 28Paonessa G. Graziani R. De Serio A. Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Salvati A.L. Toniatti C. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1942-1951Google Scholar). Expression of the chimeric receptor provides the advantage that signaling function of gp130 can be analyzed specifically in transfected cells and independently of the endogenous gp130 (17Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Google Scholar, 29Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Horseman N.D. Campos S.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23254-23257Google Scholar). Extracts from cells treated with or without GCSF indicated that each STAT form was activated by the receptor and yielded comparable SIE-binding activity (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). As shown previously (9Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14847-14850Google Scholar) in COS-1 cells not transfected with any STAT expression vectors, GCSFR-gp130 activated detectable SIE-binding activity of endogenous STAT proteins consisting primarily of STAT1. In the presence of overproduced STAT3, however, the predicted SIE binding activities characteristic for STAT3 homodimers (SIF-A complexes, Ref. 23Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Google Scholar) were obtained. Only a minor fraction of heterodimers between STAT3 and endogenous STAT1 (SIF-B complex) appeared as an additional band below the STAT3 homodimer complex. As predicted, the SIE complexes formed with wild-type STAT3 and STAT3SA were recognized by the C-20 anti-STAT3 antibody, yielding a supershifted EMSA pattern (Fig. 1 A,upper panel, lanes 7 and 8). The STAT3Δ55C-containing complex was not recognized by C-20 antibody (lane 9) but showed a characteristic slower mobility probably due to the loss of the acidic C-terminal fragment that bears the epitope for the C-20 antibody (see smaller size on Western blot in Fig. 1 A). Only STAT3Δ55C showed minor SIE-binding activity in untreated cells, which is in agreement with previous data (12Shaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Google Scholar, 13Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Google Scholar). The reaction with anti-phosphotyrosine STAT3 (Fig. 1 A,lower panel) illustrated that the phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 in each STAT3 form correlated with the DNA binding activity of the protein. To show in our experimental system that overexpressed STAT3Δ55C forms heterodimers with STAT1 or STAT3 (see also Ref. 13Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Google Scholar) we transfected varying amounts of expression vector for STAT3Δ55C, STAT3, and STAT1 into COS-1 cells. DNA binding activity of the STAT proteins was activated through GCSFR-gp130 and determined by EMSA. Dose-dependent formation of heterodimers between STAT3Δ55C and STAT1 (Fig. 1 B) or STAT3 (Fig.1 C) was clearly evident. Moreover, a shift toward predominant STAT3Δ55C homodimers at high STAT3Δ55C expression level was achieved. Analyses of subcellular fractions indicated that activated STAT3Δ55C was translocated to the nucleus, and this translocation was indistinguishable from the wild-type STAT3 or STAT3SA (data not shown). Observing that STAT3SA, contrary to previous predictions (10Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Google Scholar), was expressed at the same level as wild-type STAT3 and bound to SIE with apparently comparable affinity, we determined whether the point mutation had indeed modified the substrate behavior of STAT3 for MAPK. COS cell extracts containing overexpressed STAT3 or STAT3SA were reacted in vitro with MAPK and [32P]ATP. Immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis showed that wild-type STAT3, but not STAT3SA, was prominently labeled (data not shown), indicating that the serine to alanine mutation had effectively removed a principle phosphorylation site in STAT3. Taken together, these results confirmed the expected physicochemical properties of the two mutant STAT3 forms and also indicated that these proteins were essentially indistinguishable in their activation by the gp130 signal, complex formation, and binding to DNA substrates. Hence, these mutant forms fulfilled the preconditions for their application in probing STAT3 function as an inducer of transcription through the HP promoter. To identify the role of STAT proteins in the IL-6 regulation of the mouse HP promoter, we needed to test the IL-6-responsive mHP(237)-CAT construct in hepatic cells, because COS-1 cells failed to reproduce a liver-like regulation of that construct (data not shown). Since no mouse hepatoma cells with IL-6-regulatable endogenous HP gene expression have been identified, we selected HepG2 cells as the experimental system for their prominent IL-6 responsiveness (2Pajovic S. Jones V.E. Prowse K.R. Berger F.G. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2215-2224Google Scholar, 9Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14847-14850Google Scholar, 17Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Google Scholar). These cells were transfected with pHP(237)-CAT alone or together with expression vectors for the various STAT isoforms to demonstrate the specificity of these proteins to modify signaling by endogenous IL-6R and co-transfected GCSFR-gp130. Although we applied a transient transfection protocol that had been optimized for hepatoma cells (24O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Google Scholar), we could detect only a relative low percentage of transfected HepG2 cells in the culture (see “Experimental Procedures”) and lower protein expression than in COS-1 cells (data not shown). Nonetheless, the transfection efficiency was sufficient to verify the presence of the overexpressed STAT proteins by Western blotting and activation of their DNA binding activity through receptor signals by EMSA (Fig.2 A). By comparing the Western blot and EMSA signals for STAT3 in STAT3-transfected cells with that in control or non-STAT3 transfected cells, and by taking into consideration the low transfection efficiency, we estimated that the amount of ectopically expressed STAT3 proteins exceeded the level of endogenous STAT3 by at least 10-fold. Although the low level production of GCSFR-gp130 rendered detection of the receptor protein in the transfected culture difficult, we could determine by Western blot analysis that the expression of GCSFR-gp130 was relatively comparable among separately transfected cell cultures (Fig. 2 A, bottom part). The quantitation of CAT activities (Fig. 2 B) revealed that the expression of the mHP(237)-CAT construct was increased 2–5-fold by the action of GCSFR-gp130 and endogenous IL-6R. The cytokine (e.g. IL-6) response was further enhanced by co-treatment with dexamethasone. Co-expression of STAT1α or STAT5B was ineffective in modulating the regulation. STAT3, as well as STAT3SA, however, enhanced induction in GCSF and IL-6-treated cells by 2–3-fold. In contrast, STAT3Δ55C abrogated induction by the receptors, yet did not significantly affect basal activity of the pHP237-CAT construct. Since overexpressed receptors containing the extracellular domain of GCSFR were noted previously to reduce by unknown mechanisms the signaling by IL-6R in HepG2 cells (17Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Google Scholar), subsequent analyses of IL-6 action were determined only in cells without co-transfected GCSFR-gp130. The influence of the STAT3 forms on mHP-CAT gene regulation through the endogenous IL-6R (Fig. 2 C, upper panel) or GCSFR-gp130 (data not shown) was dependent on the dose of co-transfected STAT3 expression vectors. Generally, a maximal enhancement of the cytokine signal by wild-type STAT3 and STAT3SA was attained with 1–5 μg/ml transfected expression vector. With increasing amounts of STAT3Δ55C expression vector, the cytokine receptor-mediated induction of the reporter gene declined, reaching basal level in some instances. The B element located at positions −165 to −152) of the HP promoter is conserved among HP genes from rodents and primates and has been identified as an IL-6-responsive element (IL-6RE) (33Baumann H. Morella K.K. Jahreis G.P. Marinkovic S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5967-5976Google Scholar). Since, for unknown reasons, a binding of the isolated HP IL-6RE sequence to STAT3 could not be detected by the standard EMSA conditions as used in Fig. 1, we verified by functional cell assay that this element was the target of the regulation by STAT3.

Sequential immunoprecipitation analyses suggest this interaction is direct. Competition studies, using phosphotyrosine-containing peptides based on sequences surrounding key tyrosine residues within βc, suggest that phosphorylation of tyrosine 612 is the key event mediating the association of βc with SHP1 and SHP2. However, inhibition of SHP2 binding to βc, did not prevent tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2. Interestingly, this same phosphopeptide served as a substrate for the tyrosine phosphatase activity of both SHP1 and SHP2. Binding of these protein-tyrosine phosphatases to the IL-3 receptor may regulate IL-3 signal transduction pathways, both through their catalytic activity and through the recruitment of other molecules to the receptor complex.

We have shown previously that treatment of responsive cells with IL-3 or GM-CSF results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2, creating a docking site (Tyr304 or Tyr542) for the SH2 domain of Grb2 (7Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we found that IL-3 treatment of cells resulted in co-precipitation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase with SHP2, as well as increasing the phosphatase activity of SHP2 (7Welham M.J.

We were interested in determining other interactions mediated by SHP2 and SHP1 in response to IL-3, to investigate the possible roles for these PTPases in hemopoietic cells. Here we provide evidence that in vitro and in vivo, both SHP1 and SHP2 bind directly to the phosphorylated form of the IL-3 receptor. Using synthetic phosphopeptides we have identified potential sites for this binding and shown that these peptides can also be utilized as substrates by the SHP1 and SHP2 catalytic domains in in vitro assays.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (8Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol.

Immunoblots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) and Kodak X-AR5 film. Blots were stripped as described previously (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar).

To assay the dephosphorylation of the βc subunit phosphopeptides, the release of Pi was measured by a Malachite Green assay in half-volume 96-well plates (Costar) at 23 °C (44Harder K.W. Owen P.

Reaction mixtures containing assay buffer, 1 mmphosphopeptides, and 45 nm SHP1(ΔSH2/ΔCT) or 20 nm SHP2(ΔSH2) were incubated at room temperature with occasional agitation. After several time points, 25-μl samples were removed and added to 50 μl of Malachite Green reagent to detect the release of inorganic phosphate. The absorbance at 620 nm was measured and compared with a standard Pi curve. It has been demonstrated previously that SHP1 can associate with the murine IL-3 receptor β subunit, Aic2A, via an unmapped site (17Yi T. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No such association has been demonstrated in human cells for SHP1 or SHP2. However, we had observed previously that SHP2 was inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-3, at a site that enabled binding of Grb2. In addition we also observed co-precipitation of SHP2 with phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and activation of SHP2, raising the possibility that SHP2 has multiple functions in IL-3 signaling (7Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining whether SHP1 and SHP2 were able to act as adaptor molecules by binding to the human IL-3 receptor β subunit (βc). TF-1 cells were left untreated as a control or stimulated with IL-3, lysed, and immunoprecipitates prepared with either monoclonal anti-βc or polyclonal anti-SHP1 or anti-SHP2 antibodies. Immunoblotting was performed on the precipitates with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the results are shown in Fig. 1. A tyrosine-phosphorylated 130-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated with the anti-βc monoclonal antibody after IL-3 stimulation (Fig.1 A, lane 4). Reprobing this same blot with a polyclonal anti-βc antibody confirmed this to be βc (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). The anti-SHP1 antibodies precipitated three tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 130, 105, and 60 kDa (Fig.1 A, lanes 5 and 6). The 60-kDa phosphoprotein was present in SHP1 precipitates from both control and IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6), and blotting with anti-SHP1 antibodies (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5 and 6) confirmed that this protein was SHP1. SHP1 is constitutively phosphorylated in other hemopoietic cells (17Yi T. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this also appears to be the case in TF-1 cells. The 130- and 105-kDa species were only observed in the SHP1 precipitates from IL-3-treated cells. The identity of the 105-kDa protein is unknown; however, the 130-kDa species co-migrated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated βc precipitated by the anti-βc antibody (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylated βc co-precipitates with SHP1. We could not confirm this by reprobing this blot with polyclonal anti-βc antibodies (Fig. 1 B, lane 6), probably because the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated 130-kDa species precipitated by the anti-SHP1 antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) was considerably less than that precipitated by the anti-βc antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lane 4) and so below the limits of detection. The SHP2 antibodies precipitated four tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 70, 72, 90, and 130 kDa from IL-3-stimulated TF-1 cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). The doublet at 70 and 72 kDa corresponds to SHP2, as confirmed by immunoblotting with the SHP2 antibody (Fig.1 D, lanes 7 and 8). The identity of the 90-kDa protein is unknown. The 130-kDa protein co-migrated with tyrosine-phosphorylated βc precipitated by the anti-βc antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), and its identity as βc was confirmed by reprobing the blot with the polyclonal anti-βc antibodies (Fig.1 B, lane 8). In reciprocal experiments, in which blots of material precipitated with anti-βc were reprobed with antibodies specific for either SHP1 or SHP2, neither were detectable (Fig. 1,C and D). The monoclonal anti-βc antibody precipitates less than 10% of the βc expressed in the TF-1 cells, 2M. J. Welham, unpublished data. only a proportion of which is likely to be phosphorylated at the appropriate sites and will hence interact with downstream signaling molecules. Thus, our failure to detect SHP1 and SHP2 in the anti-βc precipitates most likely reflects the fact that the amounts present were below our limits of detection. We next investigated whether the SH2 domains of the two PTPases mediated the observed interactions with βc. Precipitates from extracts of TF-1 were prepared using fusion proteins in which GST was fused to either the SH2 domains of SHP1 (SHP1SH2-GST) or SHP2 (SHP2SH2-GST). Both SHP1SH2-GST and SHP2SH2-GST precipitated a tyrosine-phosphorylated 130-kDa protein from extracts of cells stimulated with IL-3 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and4) but not from control samples (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 3), which was recognized by the polyclonal anti-βc antibody (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). These results clearly demonstrated that the SH2 domains of SHP1 and SHP2 can associatein vitro with the tyrosine-phosphorylated βc following IL-3 stimulation. The additional proteins observed in the antibody immunoprecipitations were not observed in the SH2 domain-fusion protein precipitates. This could be for a number of reasons: (i) they interact with regions of the phosphatase other than the SH2 domains, (ii) they bind the tyrosine-phosphorylated phosphatases themselves, or (iii) they are bound to other proteins in the co-immunopreciptated complex. To ascertain whether the interactions between βc and the SH2 domains of SHP1 and SHP2 were direct, we performed sequential immunoprecipitations. Extracts of TF-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal anti-βc antibody and the precipitated material boiled and denatured in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol. The denatured primary immunoprecipitates were diluted 1 in 10 (so the concentration of SDS was <0.1%) and re-precipitated with either SHP1SH2-GST or SHP2SH2-GST. The primary anti-βc immunoprecipitation precipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated βc from cells treated with IL-3 (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), but not from control cells (Fig.2 B, lane 1). The secondary precipitations with SHP1SH2-GST and SHP2SH2-GST re-precipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated βc from the IL-3-stimulated cell extracts (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and6). Similar results were observed when the fusion proteins were used as the primary precipitants and anti-βc as the secondary precipitating agent (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the SH2 domains of SHP1 and SHP2 can bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated βc. To confirm that the observed associations involved interactions of the SH2 domains with phosphotyrosine and to provide an indication as to which of the potential tyrosines on βc was responsible for mediating the interactions with the SH2 domains of SHP1 and SHP2, we used a peptide competition assay. The tyrosine residues within the βc that become phosphorylated upon IL-3 stimulation have not been biochemically mapped, so phosphopeptides corresponding to the sequences surrounding five of the tyrosine residues within βc (see Table I) were tested for their ability to block precipitation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated βc by SHP1SH2-GST and SHP2SH2-GST. Phosphopeptides corresponding to residues surrounding tyrosines 806 and 856 were not tested, as mutants of βc that were truncated at residue 763 or beyond retain normal functions in response to IL-3 (46Sakamaki K. Miyajima T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 47Quelle F.W. Sato N. Wittuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the competition analyses are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The phosphopeptide incorporating tyrosine 612 (612) inhibited the precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated βc by SHP1SH2-GST (Fig.3 A, lane 7). Some inhibition was also consistently observed with phosphopeptide 750 (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), but not consistently with the other phosphopeptides. Only phosphopeptide 612 consistently inhibited the precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated βc by SHP2SH2-GST (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). Reprobing of this same blot with polyclonal anti-βc antibodies confirmed that the presence of phosphopeptide 612 had inhibited precipitation of βc by SHP2SH2-GST (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). SHP1 and SHP2 each contain two SH2 domains, which appear to differ in their functions (48Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used combinations of phosphopeptide 612 with the other phosphopeptides to examine the possibility that any of the latter might make a secondary contribution to the binding of SHP2 to βc. At a concentration of 100 μm (Fig.3 C, lane 3) phosphopeptide 612 almost completely inhibited (>95%) precipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated βc by SHP2SH2-GST. At 50 μm 612, inhibition was approximately 80% (Fig.3 C, lane 4). Combinations of the other phosphopeptides (50 μm) with 612 (50 μm) did not result in further reduction of the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated βc precipitated by SHP2SH2-GST (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5–8). Therefore, it appears that the SH2 domains of SHP2 interact solely"

Presenilin-1 (PS1) is subject to proteolytic cleavage resulting in the accumulation of N- and C-terminal fragments. In this report, we show that the proteolytic cleavage of PS1 is developmentally regulated in the brain. Low levels of full-length PS1 and higher levels of 30-kDa N-terminal and 20-kDa C-terminal fragments are identified at all developmental stages in the rat brain. However, in the adult brain, additional 36-kDa N-terminal and 14-kDa C-terminal fragments appear and become major PS1 species. Alternative N-terminal PS1 fragments also appear in the adult human brain, but are more heterogenous than in the rat brain. The alternative PS1 fragments are not detected at significant levels in rat or human peripheral tissues that express PS1. The alternative cleavage of PS1 is also detected in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, but not in astrocytes, and is induced by neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, alternative PS1 cleavage is detected in rat PC12 cells and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells following induction of neuronal differentiation. These results suggest that an alternative pathway of PS1 proteolytic processing is induced in the brain by neuronal differentiation.

Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Google Scholar), which acts to facilitate signaling through the Notch/lin-12 pathway, suggesting that the presenilins may play a role in the determination of cell fate during development. In particular, the importance of Notch signaling in the development of the central nervous system raises the possibility that presenilins may be directly involved in neuronal differentiation. The full-length PS1 protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage soon after synthesis so that the predominant PS1 species are N- and C-terminal fragments (6Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordtsted C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal fragments may therefore be biologically active forms of PS1. In this report, we demonstrate that the proteolytic processing of PS1 is developmentally regulated in the brain. PS1 undergoes a major alternative proteolytic cleavage in the adult rat brain that is a minor component in the fetal brain. This alternative pathway of PS1 proteolysis is hardly detectable in non-neuronal tissues that express PS1. Alternative proteolytic cleavage of PS1 is also detected in primary rat hippocampal cultures and neuronal cell lines and is induced by neuronal differentiation. We suggest that the regulation of PS1 cleavage may play a role in brain development and neuronal function. The αPS1-N antibody is a rabbit antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 2–20 of PS1 (1Sherrington R. Rogaev E.I. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Chi H. Li G.

The GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the inclusion bodies were isolated and solubilized in 0.1% SDS and used for immunization of rabbits as described (7Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 90-91Google Scholar). Both antibodies recognize human and rat PS1, but not PS2 (8Busciglio J. Hartmann H. Lorenzo A. Wong C. Baumann K. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Yankner B.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar). Cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum from fetal (E18), adult (3 month), and aged (24 month) Harlan Sprague Dawley rats were homogenized in 2 × SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete®, Boehringer Mannheim). Human fetal cortex was obtained from 15–17 weeks gestation abortuses and immediately homogenized in 2 × sample buffer. Fresh intraoperative biopsy material from adult human temporal cortex was processed in the same way. Frozen adult human cortical tissue was obtained from the Kathleen Price Bryan Brain Bank at Duke University Medical Center. The post-mortem intervals (PMI) varied from 1 to 12 h. Gray matter from the temporal cortex was dissected and homogenized in 2 × sample buffer containing protease inhibitors. Post-mortem autopsy tissue from adult human heart, liver, kidney, and spleen (PMI 10 h) was homogenized under identical conditions. The homogenates were sheared with a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 15 μg of protein was loaded per lane and separated by 4–20% or 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 2 × sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) without prior heating and then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blotting was performed with antibodies αPS1-N (1:3000) and αPS1-L (1:1000) following incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). For preabsorption controls, αPS1-N was incubated with the cognate peptide (1 μl of antiserum/6 μg of peptide) and αPS1-L was incubated with the GST-fusion protein (1 μl of antiserum/50 ng of GST-fusion protein) as described previously (10Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2092-2096Google Scholar). To inhibit immunoreactivity with GST, incubations with αPS1-L were performed in the presence of 10 μg/ml GST. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were established from embryonic day 18 (E18) fetuses and plated on polylysine-coated dishes in DMEM containing 10% supplemented calf serum (HyClone) as described previously (9Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Google Scholar). One day after plating, the medium was changed to DMEM containing N2 supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after plating. Enriched astrocyte cultures were prepared from E18 rat cortex as described previously (10Busciglio J. Gabuzda D.H. Matsudaira P. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2092-2096Google Scholar). PC12 cells were maintained on collagen-coated dishes in DMEM containing 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% fetal calf serum supplemented with glutamine. For differentiation, PC12 cells were grown in the presence of NGF (100 ng/ml) under low serum conditions (0.5% fetal calf serum). Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were maintained in α-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For differentiation, SH-SY5Y cells were grown in α-MEM containing N2 supplements in the presence of retinoic acid (1 μm) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (16 nm). Cells were harvested in 2 × sample buffer containing protease inhibitors at different stages of differentiation and processed for Western blotting as described above. To characterize the developmental regulation of PS1 expression and proteolytic cleavage in the rat brain, we examined PS1 processing in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of fetal, adult, and aged rat brain. The lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against the N terminus of PS1 (αPS1-N) and against the hydrophilic loop after the sixth predicted transmembrane domain (αPS1-L). Both antibodies have previously been shown to exhibit specificity for PS1 in transfected and untransfected cell lines and are not immunoreactive with PS2, as determined by overexpression of PS1 and PS2 in COS cells (8Busciglio J. Hartmann H. Lorenzo A. Wong C. Baumann K. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Yankner B.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar). In the fetal rat brain, the major PS1 species recognized by αPS1-N was a 30-kDa N-terminal fragment that was expressed at similar levels in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Low levels of full-length PS1, migrating at about 50 kDa, were also detected. The 30-kDa N-terminal fragment in brain co-migrated with the predominant N-terminal fragment in undifferentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1A), and in other neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines (8Busciglio J. Hartmann H. Lorenzo A. Wong C. Baumann K. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Yankner B.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar), and was detected at similar levels in the fetal, adult, and aged rat brain. However, in the adult rat brain, an additional major N-terminal fragment appeared at 36 kDa that was present at only very low levels in the fetal brain and was not detected in cultured cell lines (Fig. 1A). This fragment was detected at slightly higher levels in cortex and hippocampus than in cerebellum. Preabsorption of the αPS1-N antibody with its cognate peptide abolished immunoreactivity with both N-terminal fragments and the full-length 50-kDa species, indicating antibody specificity (Fig.1A, last lane). Western blot analysis of brain homogenates with αPS1-L, which is directed against the large PS1 C-terminal loop, showed a 20-kDa C-terminal fragment that was constitutively expressed at similar levels at all developmental stages. An additional 14-kDa C-terminal fragment appeared at very high levels in the adult and aged brain, but was detected at very low levels in the fetal brain (Fig.1A). Preincubation of αPS1-L with the PS1 loop fusion protein inhibited immunoreactivity of the antibody with the 20- and 14-kDa bands, indicating specificity for PS1 (Fig. 1A). Incubation of the antibody with the GST component of the fusion protein had no effect. The alternative 36-kDa N-terminal and 14-kDa C-terminal fragments together add up to the approximate molecular weight of full-length PS1, suggesting that these fragments are formed by proteolytic cleavage of PS1. To determine whether the alternative fragments could be generated by phosphorylation, the brain homogenates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase under conditions that effectively dephosphorylate tau. Phosphatase treatment did not alter the migration pattern of any of the PS1 fragments, indicating that the alternative PS1 fragments are unlikely to be generated by differential phosphorylation (data not shown). In addition, it has recently been shown that the presenilins are not glycosylated or sulfated (11Walter J. Capell A. Gruenberg J. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Prior R. Podlisny M.B. Fraser P. St. George-Hyslop P. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 673-691Google Scholar). Thus, the difference in electrophoretic migration between the constitutive and the alternative PS1 fragments is unlikely to be the result of post-translational modification. Taken together, these results suggest that PS1 is subject to alternative proteolytic cleavage in the adult rat brain. To determine whether the alternative cleavage of PS1 is specific for the brain, we analyzed homogenates of different peripheral tissues from the adult rat. Western blot analysis with αPS1-N demonstrated that the constitutive 30-kDa species is the predominant PS1 N-terminal fragment in the heart, liver, kidney, and spleen of the adult rat (Fig. 1B). The alternative 36-kDa N-terminal fragment identified in brain could not be detected at significant levels in peripheral tissues. Thus, alternative cleavage of PS1 is specifically increased in the brain. To determine whether the developmental change in PS1 cleavage in the brain is related to neuronal differentiation, we examined the proteolytic cleavage of PS1 in primary hippocampal cultures derived from E18 rat embryos. These cultures are highly enriched in neurons and exhibit a defined time course of neuronal differentiation (12Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at increasing time intervals after plating that corresponded to more advanced stages of neuronal differentiation. Western blot analysis with αPS1-N showed that the level of the constitutive 30-kDa N-terminal fragment was constant for 7 days in culture and then decreased by day 14 (Fig. 2A). A similar pattern of expression was observed for the constitutive 20-kDa C-terminal fragment. In contrast, the alternative 36-kDa N-terminal and 14-kDa C-terminal fragments showed a marked dependence on neuronal differentiation. These PS1 fragments were present at very low levels immediately after plating, but gradually increased at later time points corresponding to increased neuronal differentiation (Fig.2A). The alternative cleavage products generated in culture co-migrated with the alternative fragments identified in the adult rat brain (Fig. 2A). To confirm that the alternative fragments were specifically produced in neurons, we examined highly enriched astrocyte cultures. The composition of the cultures was confirmed by Western blot analysis for neuron-specific tau and astrocyte-specific GFAP (data not shown). Astrocytes did not show alternative cleavage of PS1 after 14 days in culture (Fig. 2A). Thus, the alternative proteolytic cleavage of PS1 is neuron-specific and is induced by neuronal differentiation. To further confirm that alternative cleavage of PS1 is induced by neuronal differentiation, we investigated PS1 cleavage in rat PC12 cells during the course of differentiation induced by NGF. Similar to the situation in primary rat hippocampal cultures, the levels of the constitutive 30-kDa N-terminal and 20-kDa C-terminal fragments did not change significantly over time, whereas the levels of the alternative 36-kDa N-terminal and 14-kDa C-terminal fragment gradually increased during the course of differentiation. The alternative fragments generated in differentiated PC12 cells co-migrated with the alternative fragments in the adult rat brain (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the alternative cleavage of PS1 detected in the rat brain also occurs in the human brain, we examined the PS1 cleavage pattern in human fetal and adult cortex. Western blot analysis of cortical tissue homogenates with αPS1-N showed a major 30-kDa N-terminal PS1 fragment in both fetal and adult human cortex (Fig.3A). In the adult human cortex, an additional ladder of alternative PS1 N-terminal fragments was detected migrating between 30 and 40 kDa (Fig. 3A). This heterogenous pattern of N-terminal fragments was detected to a much lesser extent in the fetal human cortex, which showed a predominant 30-kDa N-terminal fragment. This heterogeneity of N-terminal fragments differed from the discrete 36-kDa alternative fragment detected in the adult rat brain. To determine whether the heterogenous pattern of N-terminal fragments in the adult human cortex is generated in vivo, we examined PS1 proteolysis in fresh intraoperative biopsy material. Fresh human cortical tissue showed the same heterogenous pattern of N-terminal PS1 fragments as post-mortem cortical tissue (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–5). Furthermore, the level of N-terminal fragments did not vary significantly in adult human cortical samples with post-mortem intervals ranging from 1 to 12 h. These results indicate that heterogenous N-terminal cleavage of PS1 occurs in vivo in the adult human cortex. The migration pattern was not affected by phosphatase treatment (data not shown). Heterogeneity in the pattern of C-terminal fragments was not detected in the adult human cortex (Fig.3A, bottom), possibly due to decreased stability of the alternative C-terminal fragments. To determine whether the human brain exhibits a unique pattern of PS1 cleavage, as found in the rat (Fig. 1B), we examined PS1 processing in several peripheral human tissues. The generation of heterogenous N-terminal PS1 fragments was detected only in the human brain. A discrete 30-kDa N-terminal fragment was detected in the heart, liver, kidney, and spleen (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the heterogenous pattern of PS1 N-terminal fragments is induced by neuronal differentiation, we investigated PS1 cleavage in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells during the course of differentiation. Differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with retinoic acid resulted in the generation of a heterogenous pattern of N-terminal PS1 fragments (Fig. 3C), similar to the pattern found in the adult human cortex. Thus, the formation of alternative N-terminal fragments is induced by neuronal differentiation. These results suggest that proteolytic cleavage of PS1 is developmentally regulated in both the rat and human brain, although the cleavage pattern exhibits species specificity. These experiments demonstrate that the proteolytic cleavage of PS1 is developmentally regulated in the brain. Alternative cleavage of PS1 in the adult rat brain results in the appearance of brain-specific N- and C-terminal PS1 fragments. The generation of these alternative cleavage products can also be demonstrated in primary rat hippocampal cultures and is neuron-specific. Furthermore, the time course of production of the alternative fragments in hippocampal cultures, in PC12 cells and in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells suggests that their generation is related to neuronal differentiation. A role of PS1 in neuronal differentiation would be consistent with recent findings demonstrating that PS1 is present in all neuritic compartments and in growth cones of differentiating neurons (8Busciglio J. Hartmann H. Lorenzo A. Wong C. Baumann K. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Yankner B.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings in various tissues and cell lines (6Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordtsted C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Google Scholar), we identified 30-kDa N-terminal and 20-kDa C-terminal constitutive cleavage products as the predominant forms of PS1 in fetal brain. However, in the adult brain, high levels of the alternative PS1 fragments accumulate, whereas the level of constitutive fragments is not significantly changed. Although it cannot be excluded that the alternative fragments are derived from an alternatively spliced form of PS1 (1Sherrington R. Rogaev E.I. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Chi H. Li G. Holman K. Tsuda T. Mar L. Foncin J.-F. Bruni A.C. Montesi M.P. Sorbi S. Rainero I. Pinessi L. Nee L. Chumakov I. Pollen D. Brookes A. Sanseau P. Polinsky R.J. Wasco W. Da Silva H.A. Haines J.L.

Noguchi K. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 206: 113-116Google Scholar), the commensurate change in size of the N- and C-terminal fragments indicates the presence of a new proteolytic cleavage site. Examination of the human cortex also demonstrated developmental regulation of PS1 processing with the appearance of new PS1 N-terminal fragments in the adult cortex. However, in contrast to the discrete 36-kDa N-terminal band in the adult rat brain, a ladder of new PS1-N-terminal fragments appeared in the adult human brain. This ladder was detected in fresh brain biopsy material, as well as in post-mortem autopsy material, indicating that these fragments are generatedin vivo and not as a result of post-mortem autolysis. Moreover, the production of a similar heterogenous pattern of PS1 N-terminal fragments in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells in culture suggests that alternative cleavage of PS1 in the human brain is induced by neuronal differentiation. The lack of detection of alternative C-terminal fragments in the adult human cortex may be due to decreased stability or loss of the epitope recognized by our PS1 loop antibody. The sequences of mouse, rat, and human PS1 are highly homologous, but vary significantly in two regions, at the N terminus and between amino acids 319 and 330 in the large cytoplasmic loop. It has been suggested that the constitutive cleavage site of PS1 is between amino acids 290 and 300 (16Selkoe D.J. Xia W. Zhang J. Podlisny M.B. Amarante P. Haass C. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Teplow D.B. Koo E.H. Citron M. Soc. Neurosci. 1996; 22: 278Google Scholar), a region that is identical in mouse, rat, and human PS1 (15Takahashi H. Murayama M. Takshima A. Mercken M. Nakazato Y. Noguchi K. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 206: 113-116Google Scholar). However, alternative cleavage of PS1 in the variable region around amino acid 320 could give rise to the longer 36-kDa N-terminal fragment in the rat brain and may result in the generation of different N-terminal fragments in the human cortex. It is also possible that different proteases are involved in the cleavage of PS1 in the rat and human brain. Attempts to directly sequence the alternative fragments have thus far been hampered by the low levels of PS1 fragments produced in the brain and in culture and the propensity of PS1 fragments to form insoluble aggregates. The observation that PS1 processing is regulated by neuronal differentiation is intriguing in view of a potential role of PS1 in a signaling pathway that regulates cell fate decisions during development. Presenilins exhibit a high degree of homology to theC. elegans gene sel-12, which may be involved in signaling in the Notch/lin-12 pathway (5Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Google Scholar). The functional relationship of PS1 and sel-12 is supported by the finding that PS1 can rescue sel-12 loss of function mutations in C. elegans (13Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Google Scholar). Thus, PS1 may play a role in development, consistent with PS1 mRNA expression in the embryonic neuraxis and in developing organs (6Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordtsted C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Google Scholar, 14Lee M.K. Slunt H.H.

The regulation of PS1 proteolysis by neuronal differentiation suggests that PS1 may play a fundamental role in brain development and neuronal function. We thank Christine Hulette, Carlyn K.

The rapid removal of LH from the circulation in conjunction with its release from granules in response to gonadotropin releasing hormone accounts for the episodic rise and fall in hormone levels seen in the circulation.

Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347Google Scholar, 14Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Google Scholar, 15Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Google Scholar), episodic stimulation may provide for maximal activation during the preovulatory surge in circulating LH levels. TSH shows similar properties with respect to half-life and receptor activation (16Leitolf H. Szkudlinski M.W. Hoang-Vu C. Thotakura N.R. von zur Muhlen A. Brabant G. Weintraub B.D. Horm. Metab.

A. 1995; 92: 9062-9066Google Scholar). Glycoproteins bound by the S4GGnM-specific receptor are subsequently transported to lysosomes and degraded. There are roughly 600,000 S4GGnM-specific binding sites at the cell surface of hepatic endothelial cells, which bind LH through its sulfated oligosaccharides with an apparent Kd of 2.7 × 10−7m. Binding is pH-dependent, requiring a pH > 5.0, but does not require Ca2+ (12Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. Cell. 1991; 67: 1103-1110Google Scholar). The location of the sulfate in the 4-position is critical since glycoconjugates bearing oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence SO4-3GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα (S3GGnM) are not bound by hepatic endothelial cells. We have now identified and isolated a glycoprotein from rat liver that has the properties expected for the receptor, which mediates removal of LH from the circulation on the basis of its sulfated oligosaccharides. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) or ISS Protein-Gold (Integrated Separation Systems). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Following separation by SDS-PAGE on 5% or 7.5% acrylamide gels, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using CAPS buffer as described by Matsudaira (21Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar) for amino-terminal sequence determination, peptide mapping, and detection with specific antisera. Proteins detected by antisera were developed using 125I-F(ab′)2 goat anti-rabbit IgG. WGA (Sigma) was dissolved in 100 mm NaHCO3, 100 mmGlcNAc, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.4, at a concentration of 2.0 mg/ml and added to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) at a ratio of 5.0 mg/ml Sepharose 4B. Following 2 h of rotation at room temperature, >95% of the WGA was coupled. Remaining active sites were quenched by incubation overnight at 4 °C in 200 mmglycine, pH 8.0. The WGA-Sepharose was washed successively with 0.1m sodium acetate, 1.0 m NaCl, pH 4.0, and 0.1m borate, 1.0 m NaCl, pH 8.0. WGA-Sepharose was stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8, containing 0.2% NaN3. bLH-Sepharose was prepared in the same fashion with the following modifications. bLH was dissolved in 100 mm NaHCO3, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.4, at a concentration of 3.8 mg/ml and added to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B at a ratio of 6.5 mg/ml Sepharose. The coupling efficiency was >95% after 2 h at room temperature. Remaining active sites were quenched by incubation at 4 °C overnight in 1.0 methanolamine, pH 8.3. bLH-Sepharose was stored in 20 mmTris HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 2.0 mmCaCl2, pH 7.8, containing 0.2% NaN3. SO4-4GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα-(CH2)8COO-bovine serum albumin (S4GGnM-BSA), SO4-3GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα-(CH2)8COO-bovine serum albumin (S3GGnM-BSA), Mannose-bovine serum albumin (Man-BSA), or purified S4GGnM receptor, 5–10 μg, were dissolved in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 15 min on ice with a single IODOBEAD (Pierce) and 2.5 μCi of125I (Amersham, IMS30). Labeled proteins were separated from reaction products by gel filtration on Sephadex G-10 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The fractions containing 125I-labeled product were pooled and stored at −20 °C for no longer than 2 months. F(ab′) goat anti-rabbit IgG (250 μg) was iodinated in the same fashion using 500 μCi of125I in 500 μl of 20 mm NaPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5, and incubated 1 h at room temp. Binding assays (total volume of 150 μl) contained 3–5 ng of S4GGnM receptor 125I-S4GGnM-BSA (2–3 × 105 dpm), and 90 μg of hyaluronic acid and/or 90 μg of fucoidin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.8. Hyaluronic acid is a weak inhibitor of S4GGnM-BSA binding, whereas fucoidin is a potent inhibitor (12Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. Cell. 1991; 67: 1103-1110Google Scholar). Incubations were performed in a 10 × 75-mm glass tube at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 1.5 ml of ice-cold 10% (w/v) PEG 8000 (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2 and mixing. After 30 min on ice, precipitated125I-S4GGnM-BSA·S4GGnM receptor complexes were collected by vacuum filtration on Whatman GF/C filter discs, which had been soaked in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaC12, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The filters were washed twice with 1.5 ml of ice-cold 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10% (w/v) PEG 8000, and the amount of 125I determined by counting the filter in a γ-counter. In the absence of added S4GGnM receptor, <5% of the added 125I-S4GGnM-BSA was captured on the filter. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of S4GGnM receptor that is able to precipitate 1 ng of S4GGnM-BSA in the presence of hyaluronic acid above that precipitated in the presence of both hyaluronic acid and fucoidin. Harlan Sprague Dawley rats, 150–200 g each, were anesthetized and heparinized and their livers perfused with ice-cold 20 mm PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5, through the portal vein. Each liver was suspended in 20 ml of 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 (w/v) brought to pH 7.8 with solid NaHCO3 and containing 50 units/ml aprotinin. The suspension was homogenized with three 20-s bursts of a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman) at a setting of 5. Alternatively, 50 frozen rat livers weighing 300 g (Pel-Freez) were ground while frozen using a meat grinder and suspended in 400 ml of 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 (w/v) brought to pH 7.8 with solid NaHCO3and containing 50 units/ml aprotinin. The suspension was homogenized with four 15-s bursts of a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman) at a setting of 8. Sufficient 25% (w/v) Triton X-100 (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to bring the concentration of the homogenate to 10%, and the pH was adjusted to 7.7 with 1.0m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. After stirring for 1 h at 4 °C, the Triton extract was passed through cheesecloth to remove connective tissue and sedimented at 7100 × g for 20 min. Solid PEG 8000 (Sigma) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10% (w/v). The extract was stirred for 15 min at 4 °C and then allowed to stand for 30 min. Precipitated proteins were collected by sedimentation at 7100 ×g for 90 min. The supernatant was discarded. The PEG precipitate was resuspended by vigorous stirring for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.05 mNaN3, 3 mm CaCl2, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.8, 20 ml/liver. Solubilized proteins from the PEG precipitate were incubated with WGA-Sepharose (1–2 ml of WGA-Sepharose/liver) overnight at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by washing on a sintered glass funnel with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl2, 1% Triton X-100. Bound glycoproteins were subsequently eluted using the same buffer containing 300 mm GlcNAc. The WGA-Sepharose eluate was incubated with 0.5 ml of bLH-Sepharose/liver overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Unbound material was removed by washing on a sintered glass funnel with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100. The bLH-Sepharose was then eluted with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.1% Triton X-100. The eluate was immediately adjusted to pH 7.0 by addition of 1.0 m Tris base and the volume reduced using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon). The bLH-Sepharose eluate was incubated with either mannan-Sepharose (0.05 ml/liver) or mannose-Sepharose (0.05 ml/liver) and the unbound fraction taken. Bound proteins were eluted from the mannan-Sepharose and mannose-Sepharose by successive incubation with 50 mmgalactose in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm Pefabloc SC (Boehringer Mannheim) adjusted to pH 7.5 and 200 mm mannose and 5 mmEDTA in the same buffer. Polyclonal antisera to the S4GGnM receptor were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by immunization with the 180-kDa protein band isolated from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The protein band was excised, and, after extracting the gel pieces with 95% ethanol to reduce the SDS content, the gel was lyophilized. The dried gel was pulverized using a mortar/pestle and then emulsified with saline by passing through a series of successively smaller needles ranging from 18 to 23 gauge. The emulsified gel containing 5–10 μg of protein was added to TDM-emulsion (RIBI) and injected intramuscularly into the hind leg and subcutaneously at four separate sites. The rabbit was boosted in the same manner 3 weeks later and sera obtained 8–10 days later. The rabbit was subsequently boosted with antigen as required to maintain the titer of the antisera. The affinity-purified S4GGnM receptor was labeled with125I as described above. An antibody saturation curve was established using a constant amount of radiolabeled receptor (5–10 ng, 3 × 105 cpm) and increasing amounts of antisera. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose antigen-antibody complexes were washed twice with 20 mmphosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% BSA (w/v) and counted in a γ counter. Standard inhibition curves were constructed using a constant amount of radiolabeled receptor, sufficient antisera to precipitate 50–70% of the 125I-S4GGnM-R added, and increasing amounts of unlabeled receptor that had been quantitated by amino acid analysis. The amount of receptor in “unknown” samples was then determined by comparison to the standard inhibition curve. We previously identified a receptor in rat liver that can account for the rapid removal of native LH bearing Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence S4GGnM from the circulation (12Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. Cell. 1991; 67: 1103-1110Google Scholar). The S4GGnM-R is located predominantly in hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells and displays a high degree of specificity, recognizing S4GGnM-BSA but not S3GGnM-BSA. Fucoidin, a sulfated polysaccharide, inhibits binding of S4GGnM-BSA and LH by the receptor, whereas other sulfated and anionic polysaccharides do not inhibit binding or require much higher concentrations to do so. Glycoproteins bound to the S4GGnM-R are internalized, transported to lysosomes, and degraded. Binding is pH-dependent, requiring a pH above 5–6, and is not dependent on divalent cations even though divalent cations do enhance binding. We established conditions that allowed us to detect and solubilize a binding activity with the properties we had described for the S4GGnM-R. Parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) and endothelial/Kupffer cells, prepared by collagenase perfusion as described previously (12Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. Cell. 1991; 67: 1103-1110Google Scholar, 22Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. Cell. 1980; 22: 611-620Google Scholar), were disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and the nuclei and unbroken cells were collected by centrifugation. Soluble and total membrane fractions were obtained by sedimentation onto a 65% sucrose cushion. Fractions were brought to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and assayed for S4GGnM-BSA binding using the PEG precipitation assay. Binding activity was confined to the membrane fraction and the pellet containing nuclei and unbroken cells. None was found in the soluble fraction. As much as 80% of the binding activity was recovered in the membrane fraction after Dounce homogenization. The majority of the S4GGnM-BSA-specific binding activity, 64% of the total, was found in the endothelial and Kupffer cells, while 36% was in hepatocytes. We examined the ability of Triton X-100 to solubilize the binding activity from membranes. Membranes were incubated with125I-S4GGnM-BSA in the presence of increasing amounts of Triton X-100 (Fig. 1). Membranes were either collected by sedimentation in an Airfuge at 190,000 × g(Beckman) in the absence of added PEG or by filtration on GF/C filters following addition of PEG. 125I-S4GGnM-BSA was found in the membrane pellet (Fig. 1, −PEG) following addition of 0.05% Triton but not 0.01%, 0.5%, or 1.0% Triton. In contrast,125I-S4GGnM-BSA was bound in the presence of 0.05% Triton as well as 0.5% and 1.0% Triton when complexes were collected by precipitation with PEG (+PEG). At a Triton concentration of 0.05%, membrane vesicles become sufficiently permeable for the S4GGnM-R to be accessible to the 125I-S4GGnM-BSA; however, the S4GGnM-R is not solubilized at this Triton concentration and can be sedimented in the absence of added PEG. At Triton concentrations above 0.5%, the S4GGnM-R is fully solubilized and requires PEG for precipitation of complexes. Using both the sedimentation assay in the presence of 0.05% Triton and the PEG precipitation assay in the presence of 1% Triton, we determined that: 1) 3-fold more125I-S4GGnM-BSA is bound at pH 7.5 than at pH 5.0 or below; 2) EDTA does not abolish binding of S4GGnM-BSA but does reduce it to 62% of that seen in the presence of 4 mm Ca2+; and 3) fucoidin is a significantly more potent inhibitor of binding than other sulfated or anionic polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid, heparin, chondroitin sulfate, and dextran sulfate. Thus, a binding activity with the properties expected for the S4GGnM-R could be detected in rat liver membranes and solubilized with Triton X-100. We therefore developed the isolation scheme summarized in TableI.Table IIsolation of the S4GGnM-specific receptor from rat liverStepProteinBindingTotal binding units/rat liverRIATotal receptor by RIAmgunits × 106%μg%1.HomogenateND1-aND, the amount of protein determined to be in the homogenate and the PEG pellet resuspended in Triton X-100 was not considered accurate and is not included.2.Triton X-1003556210033.31003.PEG Pellet180508113.2404.Triton X-100ND1-aND, the amount of protein determined to be in the homogenate and the PEG pellet resuspended in Triton X-100 was not considered accurate and is not included.30485.WGA-Sepharose bound6.46.3109.9306.bLH-Sepharose bound0.05–0.21.151.96.7207.Man-Sepharose unbound0.05–0.21.081.7Protein values were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit or the ISS Protein-Gold kit.

Open table in a new tab Protein values were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit or the ISS Protein-Gold kit. Binding units were determined using125I-S4GGnM-BSA and the PEG precipitation assay. The amount of receptor protein present was determined by a RIA in which unlabeled S4GGnM-R was used to inhibit binding of 125I-S4GGnM-R by a rabbit antibody raised to the purified S4GGnM-R. The S4GGnM-R was solubilized using 10% Triton X-100, concentrated by precipitation with PEG 8000, and solubilized in 10% Triton X-100 prior to incubation with WGA-Sepharose. The S4GGnM-R bound to WGA-Sepharose and was eluted with 300 mm GlcNAc. The WGA-Sepharose eluate containing the S4GGnM-R was incubated with bLH-Sepharose. S4GGnM-R that bound to bLH-Sepharose was eluted by reducing the pH to 4.0 with acetate buffer. When this material was examined by SDS-PAGE, a major band was found to be present, which had an Mr of 180,000 (Fig. 2 A). Additional proteins with apparent molecular weights of 75–80,000, 60,000, 43,000, and 35,000 were also present. Following electrophoretic transfer to Immobilon-P, a ligand blot was performed using 125I-S4GGnM-BSA, which demonstrated that only the protein with an Mr of 180,000 was reactive (Fig. 2 B). An NH2-terminal sequence of LK(Y)S(Q)YQFLIYNE was obtained for the protein with an Mr of 180,000, suggesting it was closely related to the murine macrophage mannose receptor (Man-R), which has an NH2-terminal sequence of LLDARQFLIYNE (23Harris N. Super M. Rits M. Chang G. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Blood. 1992; 80: 2363-2373Google Scholar). S4GGnM-R that had been eluted from bLH-Sepharose was incubated with mannan-Sepharose or mannose-Sepharose. Neither the S4GGnM-BSA-specific binding activity nor the protein with an Mr of 180,000 was bound by immobilized mannan or mannose, whereas the other proteins in the eluate from bLH-Sepharose were bound to either mannan-Sepharose or mannose-Sepharose and removed. The mannose-Sepharose unbound fraction was homogeneous and consisted of a single band, migrating with an Mr of 180,000 when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 4), which was designated the S4GGnM-R. The NH2-terminal sequence of the S4GGnM-R suggested a close relationship to the macrophage Man-R. However, the inability of the S4GGnM-R to bind to either immobilized mannan or mannose, which are used for affinity-based purification of the Man-R from lung (24Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Google Scholar), placenta (25Lennartz M.R. Cole F.S. Shepherd V.L. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9942-9944Google Scholar), and macrophages (26Blum J.S. Stahl P.D. Diaz R. Fiani M.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 145-153Google Scholar, 27Ii M. Wada M. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 104: 587-590Google Scholar), indicated the S4GGnM-R is distinct from the Man-R. We examined the potential relationship between the S4GGnM-R and the Man-R by isolating the macrophage Man-R from rat lung by affinity chromatography on Mannose-Sepharose as described by Lennartz et al. (24Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Google Scholar) for direct comparison with the S4GGnM-R isolated from rat liver. The Man-R isolated from lung by this procedure is homogeneous and has an Mr of 180,000 when examined by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 4). As will be presented in greater detail below, the S4GGnM-R and Man-R have a number of features that indicate they are distinct and other features that indicate they are closely related. For example the following features indicate that the receptors differ. 1) The S4GGnM-R will bind to immobilized ligands containing terminal GalNAc-4-SO4 but not ligands with terminal Man, while the Man-R will bind to immobilized ligands containing terminal Man but not those containing terminal GalNAc-4-SO4. 2) The S4GGnM-R is able to bind soluble ligands terminating with S4GGnM as well as ligands with terminal Man or Fuc in the PEG precipitation assay, whereas the Man-R will bind ligands with terminal Man or Fuc but not those with terminal S4GGnM in the same assay. Features indicating the receptors are structurally related include the following observations. 1) The S4GGnM-R and the Man-R both react with 125I-Man-BSA in ligand blots. 2) Antibodies raised to either the purified S4GGnM-R from liver or the Man-R from lung react with either receptor in Western blots. 3) The receptors have similar peptide maps, and multiple peptides prepared from the S4GGnM-R have sequences that are identical to those of the murine macrophage Man-R (23Harris N. Super M. Rits M. Chang G. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Blood. 1992; 80: 2363-2373Google Scholar). The S4GGnM-R (200 μg) and the Man-R (150 μg) were subjected to electrophoretic separation on 5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon (Millipore) in CAPS buffer. After staining with Ponceau Red, the regions containing the transferred protein were excised for analysis. Peptides were released by digestion with LysC or trypsin in the presence of reduced Triton X-100 and separated by reverse phase chromatography. The separations are shown in Fig. 3 for peptides released by LysC digestion of the S4GGnM-R and the Man-R. The profiles were nearly identical. Only peaks 57 and 75 of the S4GGnM-R were not also present in the Man-R. Peaks 45, 62, and 91 of the S4GGnM-R appeared to be identical to peaks 37, 54, and 84 of the Man-R, respectively. Peaks that appeared to be identical and peaks that appeared to differ between the S4GGnM-R and the Man-R were analyzed. The results of these analyses are summarized in Table II.Table IIComparison of peptides obtained from the S4GGnM-R and the Man-RSource of PeptideResidues from Man-R or ASGP-R sequenceRegion of Man-RPeptide sequenceS4GGnM-RMan-RPK-45PK-37Man-R:447–458CRD 2WLPGEPSHENNRPK-62PK-54Man-R:327–335Stalk 2WENLECVQKPK-62PK-54Man-R:178–187Fibronectin type IIWYADCTSAGRPK-91PK-84Man-R:132–151Cysteine-richGSGLWSRWKVYGTTDDLCSRPK-57No equivalent peakMan-R:24–33Cysteine-richQFLIYNEDHKPK-57No equivalent peakASGP-R:211–222WVDGTDYETGFKPK-78No equivalent peakASGP-R:223–238NLRPGQPDDWYGHILGPK-41 (tryptic map)Man-R:34–53Cysteine-richR-VDALSAISVQTAT-NPEAPK-46 (tryptic map)Man-R:1320–1341CRD 8TGDPSGE(R)ND-VVLSSSS(G)L-NPK-61 (tryptic map)Man-R:573–596CRD 3GTFRWTVDEQVFTH-NADMPGRKPK-75 (tryptic map)Man-R:829–848CRD 5KNFGDLATIKSESEKKFLWKPeptides were released from the S4GGnM-R or the Man-R by LysC digestion and fractionated by reverse phase chromatography as shown in Fig. 3.

https://openalex.org/W1980383883,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation in many cell types. We have previously shown that in T cells the PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin, interferes with activation of the mitogen-activated kinase, Erk2, after T cell receptor (TcR) stimulation. To further explore the involvement of PI3-K in T cell activation, we created a set of potentially dominant negative PI3-K constructs comprising individual or tandem domains of the regulatory p85 subunit and tested their effect on downstream signaling events like Erk2 activation and transcription from an NFAT (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) element taken from the interleukin-2 promoter. Following TcR stimulation, activation of Erk2 was only inhibited by a previously described truncated form of p85 that cannot bind the catalytic subunit, but not by other constructs of p85. In contrast, several mutant p85 alleles had dramatic effects on NFAT activation. Most interestingly, the N-terminal SH2 domain had an inhibitory effect, whereas a mutant p85 containing only the two SH2 domains enhanced basal NFAT activity in a Ras-dependent manner. Ionomycin induced synergistic activation of NFAT in cells expressing p85 mutants that contained the C-terminal SH2 domain. Analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins bound to truncated p85 constructs revealed cooperative binding of the two SH2 domains but no apparent differences between the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains. Wortmannin did not interfere with NFAT activation, although it inhibited PI3-K and Erk2 activation in the same experiment. These results suggest that PI3-K is involved in NFAT activation through a complex adaptor function of its regulatory subunit and that its lipid kinase activity is dispensable for this effect. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation in many cell types. We have previously shown that in T cells the PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin, interferes with activation of the mitogen-activated kinase, Erk2, after T cell receptor (TcR) stimulation. To further explore the involvement of PI3-K in T cell activation, we created a set of potentially dominant negative PI3-K constructs comprising individual or tandem domains of the regulatory p85 subunit and tested their effect on downstream signaling events like Erk2 activation and transcription from an NFAT (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) element taken from the interleukin-2 promoter. Following TcR stimulation, activation of Erk2 was only inhibited by a previously described truncated form of p85 that cannot bind the catalytic subunit, but not by other constructs of p85. In contrast, several mutant p85 alleles had dramatic effects on NFAT activation. Most interestingly, the N-terminal SH2 domain had an inhibitory effect, whereas a mutant p85 containing only the two SH2 domains enhanced basal NFAT activity in a Ras-dependent manner. Ionomycin induced synergistic activation of NFAT in cells expressing p85 mutants that contained the C-terminal SH2 domain. Analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins bound to truncated p85 constructs revealed cooperative binding of the two SH2 domains but no apparent differences between the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains. Wortmannin did not interfere with NFAT activation, although it inhibited PI3-K and Erk2 activation in the same experiment. These results suggest that PI3-K is involved in NFAT activation through a complex adaptor function of its regulatory subunit and that its lipid kinase activity is dispensable for this effect.

The p85 subunit contains a number of domains that mediate protein-protein interactions and are commonly found in signaling proteins: one Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, two proline-rich regions, two SH2 domains, and a region with similarity to the breakpoint cluster region gene (BCR homology region). Binding of the catalytic p110 subunit occurs through interaction of the region between the SH2 domains of p85 (inter-SH2 domain or iSH2) and the extreme N terminus of the catalytic subunit (12Dhand R.

However, the in vivo function of these and the other PI3-K domains, and their contribution to various signaling processes downstream of PI3-K, are poorly understood. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; T cell antigen receptor; nuclear factor of activated T cells; phorbol myristate acetate; Src homology; inter-SH; monoclonal antibody; protein kinase C; hemagglutinin; cyclosporin A; Jurkat cells stably expressing the simian virus large antigen. We have previously shown that TcR-induced activation of the mitogen-activated kinase, Erk2, requires PI3-K activity since the PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked Erk2 activation (22Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mutated form of p85 that lacked the p110-binding iSH2 region (p85ΔiSH2) reduced Erk2 activation, presumably by occupying PI3-K binding sites on other cellular proteins. To study this in more detail and to shed some light on the physiological role of the various domains, we have generated a set of truncated p85 mutants to study the role of PI3-K domains in T cell activation. As a functional readout we used a reporter gene driven by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which is a transcription factor complex that plays a key role in the induction of the interleukin-2 gene and other lymphokine genes during T cell activation (23Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). It consists of two components: preexisting cytosolic NFATp, which translocates into the nucleus in response to a calcium signal, and a nuclear component, AP-1, which consists of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins and is induced by a cascade of mitogen-activated protein kinase-related protein kinases and as a result of protein kinase C activation. NFAT-driven expression of reporter genes has been widely used as a physiologically relevant assay to study signal transduction events that lead to cytokine expression in T cells. Here we report that PI3-K has different effects on Erk2 and NFAT activation. Erk2 activation in response to TcR engagement was sensitive to wortmannin, and only inhibited by overexpressing p85ΔiSH2, but not individual p85 domains. NFAT activation, on the other hand, was not sensitive to wortmannin, but was inhibited by the SH3 domain, the N-terminal SH2 domain, and a p85 fragment comprising the two proline-rich regions and the BCR homology domain. In contrast, three constructs that contain the C-terminal SH2 domain caused an elevated basal level of NFAT activity, which was synergistically increased by ionomycin. Both the increased basal NFAT level and the activation following TcR stimulation depended on functional Ras and calcineurin. These studies provide evidence that PI3-K is involved in cytokine induction in a way that does not involve enzymatic activity but a previously unrecognized adaptor function of the regulatory subunit. The anti-CD3ε mAb, OKT3, was purified from ascites fluid by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. mAb 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine) and anti-p85 rabbit serum were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-HA epitope mAb 12CA5 was from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN). Anti-Erk2 polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The c-Myc-tagged Erk2 cDNA was from Dr. C. Marshall (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research). The c-Myc epitope is recognized by mAb 9E10. Anti-phospho-Erk2 antibody was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The luciferase reporter plasmid, NFAT-luc, was a generous gift from Dr. G. Crabtree. Luciferin was from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI). The p85ΔiSH2 and iSH2 constructs have been described previously (22Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). p85 fragments encoding the amino acids indicated in Fig. 1A were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers tailed with Xba I and Eco RI (SH3, PBP, N-SH2), Eco RI and Nde I (C-SH2), orXba I and Nde I (NC, NiC, full-length p85) sites. p85ΔiSH2 was used as a template for NC; wild-type bovine p85α was used as a template for the other constructs. The N-terminal fragment of p110 (amino acids 1–171) was amplified using bovine p110α as a template and primers tailed with Nhe I and Nde I sites. The fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the vector pEF-HA (22Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion proteins express an influenza hemagglutinin epitope YPYDVPDYA at their N terminus. All constructs prepared for this study were verified by sequencing. Jurkat cells stably expressing the simian virus large T antigen (J-TAg) were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, glutamine, antibiotics, and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Transient transfections were carried out by electroporation as described before (22Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Typically, a total amount of DNA of 17–20 μg was added to 20 × 106 cells (5 μg of c-lmyc-tagged Erk2 plus 15 μg of PI3-K construct or empty vector, or 2 μg of NFAT-luc plus 15 μg of PI3-K construct or empty vector). These were performed essentially as described previously (22Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two days after transient transfection, J-TAg cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml OKT3, 50 ng/ml PMA, or 1 μg/ml ionomycin, or left untreated for 3–4 h in 24-well plates in a tissue culture incubator. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mmKPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min, and 50 μl were used for luciferase assays in an automated luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). The final assay contained 50 μl of lysate plus 100 μl of ATP solution (10 mm ATP, 35 mmglycyl-glycine, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2) plus 100 μl of luciferin reagent (0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin, 35 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2). The protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined by the Bradford protein assay and used to normalize the luciferase activity. Typically, the variation in protein concentration between samples was smaller than 20%. Among the signaling components thought to be downstream of the TcR and PI3-K is the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Erk2 (24Nel A.E. Hanekom C. Rheeder A. Williams K. Pollack S. Katz R. Landreth G.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2683-2689PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin, and a mutated form of p85 that cannot bind the catalytic subunit (p85ΔiSH2) inhibited Erk2 activation in T cells (22Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of p85 domains in Erk2 activation and other processes relevant to T cell activation we generated a set of truncated p85 constructs (Fig.1 A). Transient expression of these constructs in J-TAg cells yielded anti-HA reactive proteins of the expected sizes (Fig. 1 B). We tested these constructs for an effect on Erk2 activation by co-expressing them with c-Myc-tagged Erk2 in J-TAg cells. 48 h after transfection, the cells were either stimulated for 3 min with the anti-CD3 antibody, OKT3, or left untreated. c-Myc-tagged Erk2 was immunoprecipitated using the mAb 9E10, and in vitro kinase assays were performed using MBP as a substrate. As can be seen in the upper panel of Fig. 2, only p85ΔiSH2 clearly inhibited Erk2 activation, presumably because it binds to PI3-K-activating proteins or sites but fails to transduce a signal to the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3-K. All other constructs had negligible effects on Erk2 activation, although they were efficiently expressed (data not shown). The SH3 domain and PBP seemed to increase Erk2 activation, but an anti-Erk2 blot on the same 9E10 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, lower panel) showed that these two samples contained slightly more Erk2 protein. Thus, it seems that multiple domains of endogenous p85 need to be competed away by transfected constructs to inhibit this pathway. To further characterize the role of PI3-K in T cell activation we studied the effect of truncated p85 and p110 constructs on the activation of the transcription factor NFAT. J-TAg cells were co-transfected with NFAT-luc and PI3-K constructs and stimulated with OKT3 for 3–4 h. Luciferase activity was assayed in the cell lysates as a reporter for NFAT activation. Fig. 3 A shows that PI3-K constructs had complex effects on NFAT activity following TcR/CD3 stimulation. The SH3 domain, a fragment containing two proline-rich regions and the BCR homology domain (PBP), the N-terminal SH2 domain (N-SH2), and the inter-SH2 domain (iSH2) all inhibited NFAT activation, whereas the C-terminal SH2 domain (C-SH2) increased the basal NFAT activity without affecting the level of NFAT activity after TcR/CD3 stimulation. The C-SH2 domain seemed to have a dominant effect over the N-SH2 domain since constructs containing both SH2 domains (p85NC and p85NiC) behaved more like C-SH2 than like N-SH2. p85ΔiSH2 and full-length p85 both lead to elevated basal levels of NFAT activity with almost no further stimulation after TcR engagement. The N-terminal fragment of p110 that binds p85 (p110 NT) did not substantially affect NFAT activation, but it was expressed at a lower level than the p85 constructs. This experiment was repeated three times with different batches of DNA and yielded very reproducible results. Activation of NFAT requires two signals, one involving calcium (inducible by ionomycin), and one involving Ras (inducible by PMA; reviewed in Ref. 25Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). To test whether the mutated PI3-K constructs used in this study acted in the calcium pathway or in the Ras pathway, we tested their effect on NFAT activation in cells that had been stimulated with either PMA or ionomycin (Fig. 3 B). PMA alone did not activate NFAT, and none of the p85 mutants had a synergistic effect on NFAT in the presence of PMA. Ionomycin, on the other hand, synergistically activated NFAT in cells that were transfected with p85 constructs containing the C-terminal SH2 domain. We conclude that these “activating” mutants mimicked or induced a process in the Ras/PKC pathway, which together with an increase in intracellular calcium lead to a strong activation of NFAT. Calcineurin is a cytosolic Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFATp in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent way, a critical step for nuclear translocation of NFATp and assembly of functional NFAT complexes. To ask if calcineurin is involved in NFAT activation by p85NC, we took advantage of the immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent inhibitor of calcineurin (26O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 27Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that CsA efficiently inhibited NFAT activation after stimulation with either OKT3 or ionomycin. In cells transfected with inhibitory p85 constructs (SH3, PBP, and N-SH2), CsA inhibited NFAT even further. Because the inhibition of NFAT that is caused by these p85 constructs seems to have an additional effect to the inhibition mediated by CsA, we speculate that also these p85 constructs act in the Ras/PKC pathway. In the presence of the activating construct, p85NC, inhibition by CsA was substantial, but not complete. This is compatible with p85NC stimulating the Ras/PKC-dependent pathway. The Ras GTPase has been implicated in PI3-K signaling (28Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to bind directly to the catalytic subunit of PI3-K (21Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). To address whether the increase in basal NFAT activity in cells expressing p85NC requires functional Ras, we co-transfected cells with NFAT-luc, p85NC, and increasing amounts of dominant negative Ras (RasN17). Both the basal NFAT activity in unstimulated cells, as well as the TcR-induced activation, were inhibited by RasN17 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). It is important to note that the expression level of p85NC was not affected by RasN17. Therefore, RasN17-mediated abrogation of p85NC-induced basal NFAT activity cannot be explained by loss of p85NC expression. To understand the complex effects on NFAT activation of the mutant p85 constructs used in this study, we sought to correlate them with the catalytic activity of endogenous PI3-K in the transfected cells. We therefore decided to ask first whether PI3-K catalytic activity is required for NFAT activation. Wortmannin has been widely used to irreversibly inhibit PI3-K and to demonstrate the involvement of PI3-K in many cellular processes (29Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We transiently transfected cells with NFAT-luc (plus empty vector). Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of wortmannin for 30 min and then stimulated with OKT3 for 3 h. To verify inhibition of PI3-K by wortmannin, samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the OKT3-stimulation (after 3 min and 3 h, respectively) and from unstimulated control cells and assayed for PI3-K activity in p85 immunoprecipitates. Activation of Erk2 was tested by immunoblotting of total cell lysates of the same samples with an anti-phospho-Erk2 antibody. After 3 h of stimulation with OKT3, cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. The upper panel of Fig.6 shows that increasing concentrations of wortmannin progressively inhibited PI3-K activity, and that this inhibition lasted for the entire duration of the stimulation with OKT3. This is important, because wortmannin is known to be unstable, and de novo synthesis of PI3-K might partially reverse the effect of wortmannin once it is hydrolyzed. Erk2 activation was observed after 3 min of stimulation and was sensitive to wortmannin as shown before (22Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, middle). No Erk2 activation was observed after 3 h of stimulation with OKT3 (data not shown). Surprisingly, wortmannin did not inhibit NFAT activation (Fig. 6, lower panel). At the highest wortmannin concentration, we tested to achieve complete inhibition of PI3-K, NFAT activation was even higher than in untreated cells, but this may be due to lack of specificity of wortmannin at this concentration. We therefore conclude that the kinase activity of PI3-K is not required for NFAT activation or may even have an inhibitory effect. The effect of p85 domains on NFAT is likely to be mediated by cellular proteins that bind to them. To learn more about the role of PI3-K domains in NFAT activation, we transiently expressed the constructs described above in J-TAg cells and immunoprecipitated them with an anti-HA antibody from resting and from OKT3-stimulated cells. Bound phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting (Fig. 7). While the SH3 domain and the PBP fragment did not associate with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, all constructs that contained one or two SH2 domains coprecipitated with a similar set of proteins. A tandem arrangement of the two SH2 domains seemed to be essential for efficient binding to cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, especially for the ≈21-kDa protein, which we identified as the TcR ζ chain (data not shown). However, there was no major difference in the pattern of proteins bound to either the N-SH2 domain or the C-SH2 domain. The functional difference of the two SH2 domain constructs with regard to NFAT stimulation can therefore not readily be explained by different binding characteristics of the SH2 domains. In this study, we overexpressed potentially dominant negative mutants to investigate the role of heterodimeric p85/p110 PI3-K in the activation of the mitogen-activated kinase, Erk2, and the transcription factor, NFAT. We found that PI3-K was involved in both processes, but in fundamentally different ways. Erk2 activation was inhibited by wortmannin and by a mutated p85 that cannot bind to the catalytic p110 subunit, but overexpression of other p85 constructs had no effect. Activation of NFAT, on the other hand, was insensitive to wortmannin, but was affected by overexpression of truncated forms of p85 in a different way than Erk2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that describes a role of PI3-K in NFAT activation. Since catalytic activity does not seem to be involved, we speculate that p85 may have an adaptor function that is crucial for NFAT activation. This adaptor function would not only recruit p110 to the membrane but also bring other signaling proteins together, which then activate NFAT. The used p85 constructs fall into two classes: (i) those that inhibit TcR/CD3-mediated NFAT activation (SH3, PBP, N-SH2, and iSH2) and (ii) those that increase NFAT activity in resting cells and synergize with ionomycin (C-SH2, NC, NiC, p85ΔiSH2, wild-type p85). Most striking is perhaps that the two SH2 domains had opposite effects on NFAT activation although their sequence specificity for phosphoprotein binding is similar (Y*XX M) (30Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar), and although they bound a comparable pattern of cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. It is interesting to note that in a study using microinjected antibodies against either SH2 domain of p85, anti-N-SH2 antibodies had a different effect than anti-C-SH2 antibodies (31McIlroy J.

It is unlikely that p85 acts through Cbl, because a transforming Cbl mutant that constitutively activated NFAT (70/Z3) still did so even after its binding to PI3-K was disrupted by a point mutation (40Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A connection between PI3-K and Ras has been demonstrated in several reports. Ras can bind p110 in a GTP-dependent manner, and transfection of Ras resulted in an elevation of 3-phosphoinositides, whereas dominant negative RasN17 inhibited production of 3-phosphoinositides (21Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Together with the finding that GTP-Ras could activate PI3-K (41Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), this argues for a role of Ras upstream of PI3-K. On the other hand, constitutively active PI3-K increased the amount of GTP-bound Ras and activated the c-fos promoter, and coexpression of dominant negative Ras blocked c-fos activation (42Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Ras is also playing a major role in TcR-induced NFAT activation (43Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 44Woodrow M.A. Rayter S. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3853-3861PubMed Google Scholar). We were wondering if functional Ras was required for the p85NC-mediated increase in NFAT activity, and cotransfection of RasN17 showed that this was indeed the case. This would place Ras downstream of PI3-K in T cells, but does not exclude a role also upstream of PI3-K. Although we presently do not know the molecular mechanism by which p85 activates NFAT, we found that several p85 constructs acted on NFAT activation via the Ras/PKC pathway. Activation of NFAT depends on two signals; calcium/calcineurin is required for nuclear translocation of NFATp, and Ras/PKC is required for induction of AP-1. Those p85 alleles that increased the basal NFAT level also synergized with ionomycin (but not with PMA), which suggests that they mimicked a process in the Ras/PKC pathway to cooperate with calcium/calcineurin. And while cyclosporin A effectively inhibited NFAT activation, coexpression of inhibitory p85 constructs caused an additional decrease in NFAT activity, most likely by interfering with the Ras/PKC pathway. Finally, the finding that RasN17 blocked p85NC-induced NFAT activation provides additional evidence for a function of p85 in the Ras pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that p85 with its multiple domains plays an important and complex role in TcR-induced gene activation."

It shows a strongly red continuum reflectance and several prominent infrared absorption features. The strongest absorptions in 1993SC’s spectrum occur near 1.62, 1.79, 1.95, 2.20, and 2.32 micrometers in wavelength. Features near the same wavelengths in the spectra of Pluto and Neptune’s satellite Triton are due to CH 4 on their surfaces, suggesting the presence of a simple hydrocarbon ice such as CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 , or C 2 H 2 on 1993SC. In addition, the red continuum reflectance of 1993SC suggests the presence of more complex hydrocarbons."
https://openalex.org/W2168631501,"Rab4, a member of the Rab family of Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins, has been shown to be associated with GLUT4-containing vesicles and implicated in the insulin action on glucose transport in rat adipocytes. In the present study, we investigated the insulin effects on the guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4. In electrically permeabilized rat adipocytes, the amount of [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotrisphosphate) (GTPγS) bound to Rab4 increased in a time-dependent manner during 45 min of the incubation period. Addition of insulin resulted in about a 2-fold stimulation of the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Rab4, indicating that insulin stimulated the guanine nucleotide exchange on the GTPase. Pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, completely abolished the stimulatory effect of insulin on [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4. Wortmannin also attenuated the nucleotide binding to Rab4 in the basal cells, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity may be essential for regulation of guanine nucleotide exchange on the GTPase and insulin may up-regulate the exchange activity by stimulating the lipid kinase. Insulin-induced subcellular redistribution of Rab4 from the microsomal fraction to the soluble fraction was also inhibited by wortmannin. These results suggest that insulin stimulates the guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4 via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway and that Rab4 is one of possible targets of insulin action on intracellular vesicle traffic in rat adipocytes.

These results suggest that insulin stimulates the guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4 via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway and that Rab4 is one of possible targets of insulin action on intracellular vesicle traffic in rat adipocytes. Insulin stimulates glucose transport in muscles and adipose cells by promoting translocation of glucose transporter isoform, GLUT4, from intracellular compartmment(s) to the plasma membrane (1Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Google Scholar, 2Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem J. 1993; 295: 329-341Google Scholar, 3James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-126Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanisms of the insulin action are still obscure. Recent kinetic and morphological studies have proposed a three-compartment model for the subcellular trafficking of GLUT4 (3James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-126Google Scholar,4Holman G.D. Lo Leggio L. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17516-17524Google Scholar). In the model, GLUT4 molecules are associated with at least two intracellular compartments; one is the early endosome in which GLUT4 molecules seem to appear only in the presence of insulin, and the second one is a more specialized compartment where the glucose transporter molecules are sequestrated in the basal state. Although the precise nature of the latter compartment remains indistinct, after insulin stimulation, GLUT4 molecules leave the compartment, are recruited on the plasma membrane, and then enter the endosomal recycling pathway. Over the past decade, it has become apparent that intracellular vesicle traffic is regulated by a variety of GTP-binding proteins, including Rab and Arf families of Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins (5Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Google Scholar, 6Boman A.L. Kahn R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 147-150Google Scholar), as well as trimeric GTP-binding proteins (7Helms J.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 84-88Google Scholar) and large GTP-binding proteins such as dynamin (8Liu J.-P. Robinson P.J. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 590-607Google Scholar). In permeabilized adipocytes, nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs induce GLUT4 translocation, suggesting that GTP-binding protein(s) may be involved in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (9Baldini G.

Robinson F.W. Kono T Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 327-332Google Scholar). In this regard, Rab3D has been shown to be predominantly expressed in adipocytes and induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes (13Baldini G. Hohl T. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5049-5052Google Scholar), although it remains to be demonstrated whether the GTPase is involved in the insulin action (14Baldini G. Scherer P.E. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4284-4288Google Scholar). On the other hand, Cormont et al. (15Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Google Scholar) reported that Rab4 is associated with GLUT4-containing vesicles in rat adipocytes, and insulin stimulation resulted in redistribution of the protein from the vesicle to the cytosol. Rab4, a member of the Rab family, has been demonstrated to be associated with the early endosomes (17Van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Goud B. Mellman I. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Google Scholar). In a previous report, to elucidate the physiological significance of Rab4 in the insulin action, we incorporated into rat adipocytes a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Rab4 hypervariable carboxyl-terminal domain and showed that the peptide specifically inhibited glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation stimulated by insulin or GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are:GTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotrisphosphate)PIphosphatidylinositolGAPGTPase-activating protein (16Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Google Scholar), providing evidence that Rab4 plays a critical role in the insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. It remains to be clarified, however, whether or not Rab4 lies downstream of the insulin receptor and functions as a signaling component of insulin activation of glucose transport. In the light of the observations that insulin stimulates exocytosis of GLUT1 (20Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Google Scholar, 21Verhey K.J. Yeh J.-I. Birnbaum M.J. J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Google Scholar), both constitutively recycling cell surface proteins, Rab4 might be a possible target of insulin action on intracellular trafficking of these proteins. In the present study, we examined this possibility and demonstrated that guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4 was stimulated by insulin in a wortmannin-sensitive manner, providing evidence for the first time that Rab4 lies downstream of the insulin-stimulated phosphatidyl inositol (PI) 3-kinase. guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotrisphosphate) phosphatidylinositol GTPase-activating protein 125I-Labeled protein A and [35S]GTPγS were from DuPont NEN. GTPγS was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Wortmannin was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mm (stock solution). LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO at 5 mm (stock solution). Protein G-Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against GLUT4 were raised in this laboratory as described previously (24Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against rat Rab4 were obtained by immunizing a rabbit with peptide, (C)QLRSPRRTQAPSAQE conjugated with bovine serum albumin. The anti-Rab4 antisera were purified with SulfoLink coupling gel column (Pierce) coupled with the peptide according to the manufacturer's instruction. When immunoblot was performed using total homogenate of rat adipocytes, a single band with a molecular size of 25 kDa was recognized with the anti-Rab4 antibodies. Isolated adipocytes were prepared by the collagenase method from epididymal adipose tissues of Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (from Charles-River, approximately 170–220 g) (25Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, isolated cells were suspended in buffer A (25 mm Krebs-Henseleit Hepes buffer supplemented with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V) and 3 mmpyruvate, pH 7.4). [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 was measured as described by Ullrich et al. (26Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Google Scholar) with a modification. The isolated cells were washed and resuspended in high K+/low Ca2+ buffer designated as buffer X (118.0 mmKCl, 4.74 mm NaCl, 0.38 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.18 mm MgSO4, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 23.4 mmHepes/KOH, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm pyruvate, pH 7.4) (27Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Google Scholar), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, the electroporation was carried out four times in a Gene-Pulser (from Bio-Rad) set at 25 microfarads and 2.0 kV/cm. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C without or with 100 nm insulin, the permeabilized cells were incubated for an additional 30 min in the presence of 50 μm [35S]GTPγS. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed and homogenized in washing buffer (25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm GTP, 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5), and the homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 3,000 × g. The pellet and the fat fraction were discarded, and Nonidet P-40 was added to the infranatant solution to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). One half of the infranatant was incubated with 15 μl of affinity-purified anti-Rab4 antibodies and 20 μl (bed volume) of protein G-Sepharose (from Pharmacia) for 40 min on a rocking platform at 4 °C. The other half was incubated with protein G-Sepharose alone. The Sepharose beads were spun down at 4 °C for 1 min at 3,000 × g and washed twice in 1 ml of washing buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The beads were filtered through 25-mm nitrocellulose filter, and the filter was washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold filtration buffer (25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5). The filter was dried and counted in 10 ml of scintillation fluid in a scintillation counter. The amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to Rab4 immunoprecipitated with anti-Rab4 antibodies was determined after subtraction of the radioactivity obtained with protein G-Sepharose alone. The cellular glucose transport activity was estimated by measuring the rate of 0.1 mm 3-O-methyl-d-glucose uptake by the oil-flotation method as described previously (27Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Google Scholar). The microsomal and soluble fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation as described previously (24Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Google Scholar). The cells were washed and homogenized in STE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris/HCl, and 1 mm EDTA/Na, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged for 2 min at 3,000 × g. The pellet (P-1) and the fat fraction were discarded, and the infranatant solution (S-1) was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant (S-2) was saved as the microsomal fraction and pelleted by centrifugation for 60 min at 150,000 × g. The resulting supernatant (S-3) was saved as the soluble fraction. Immunodetection of Rab4 was carried out as described previously (24Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins in the microsomal and soluble fractions were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12% polyacrylamide gels, as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (from Millipore) at 120 mA for 4 h. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked with solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 154 mm NaCl for 1 h at room temperature. The blocked membrane was incubated in anti-Rab4 antibodies (1:500 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed and incubated with125I-protein A (0.2 μCi/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Following extensive washes, the membrane was dried, and the blots were visualized by using FUJIX BAS2000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test. All the results reported herein were confirmed by repeating the experiments with different batches of adipocytes on different occasions. In the present study, we first examined the amount of [35S]GTPγS specifically bound to Rab4 in electrically permeabilized rat adipocytes. As reported previously, exogenously added nucleotides such as cyclic AMP and GTPγS can enter the cell interior and stimulate lipolysis (27Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Google Scholar) and glucose transport (11Suzuki Y. Shibata H. Inoue S. Kojima I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 572-580Google Scholar), respectively, in electrically permeabilized cells. In addition, insulin considerably stimulates glucose transport as well as translocation of GLUT4 in these cells (24Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Google Scholar). To measure the amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to Rab4, the GTPase was immunoprecipitated with anti-Rab4 antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads after the cells were incubated with [35S]GTPγS. As shown in Fig. 1, the radioactivity associated with the pellet in the presence of the antibodies decreased by the addition of the antigen peptide, (C)QLRSPRRTQAPSAQE, in a concentration-dependent manner. At 1 mg/ml of the peptide, the radioactivity associated with the pellet was not significantly different from that obtained in the absence of the antibodies. Those blank values were essentially unchanged either in the absence or the presence of insulin (data not shown). In the following experiments, the amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to Rab4 was determined by subtraction of the radioactivity obtained with protein G-Sepharose beads alone. Under the conditions with anti-Rab4 antibodies, nearly all Rab4 molecules were immunoprecipitated, since no Rab4 was detected by immunoblotting in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation either in the basal or insulin-stimulated cells (data not shown). Next, we incubated the cells with [35S]GTPγS for increasing periods of time in the absence and the presence of insulin. As shown in Fig. 2, the amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to immunoprecipitated Rab4 increased in a time-dependent manner during 45 min of the incubation period in the absence of insulin. Addition of 100 nminsulin resulted in about 2-fold stimulation of the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Rab4. The stimulatory effect of insulin on [35S]GTPγS binding was detected at as early as 5 min after the addition of the hormone. These results suggested that insulin acutely stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4 GTPase in rat adipocytes. Since our previous report indicated that Rab4 may play a critical role in the insulin-induced exocytotic fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles (16Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Google Scholar), we compared, in the next set of experiments, the effects of insulin on [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 and cellular glucose transport activity. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the stimulatory effects of insulin of [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 were concentration-dependent and in good correlation with those of glucose transport activity. Several lines of recent experimental evidence suggest that PI 3-kinase is an indispensable signaling component of insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation. Thus, pharmacological attenuation of the kinase with wortmannin or LY294002, both potent and specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, markedly decreases the insulin effects on glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation (29Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Google Scholar, 30Kanai F. Ito K. Todaka M. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Ishii K. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Ebina Y. Biochem.

Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Google Scholar). In addition, microinjection or overexpression of a mutant p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase lacking the ability to bind and activate the p110 catalytic subunit inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (33Kotani K. Carozzi A.J. Sakaue H. Hara K. Robinson L.J. Clark S.F. Yonezawa K. James D.E. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 343-348Google Scholar, 34Quon M.J. Chen H. Ing B.L. Liu M.L. Zarnovski M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5403-5411Google Scholar). These observations led us to investigate whether the activation of Rab4 by insulin is dependent on PI 3-kinase activity. As depicted in Fig.4, pretreatment of the cells with 100 nmwortmannin or 50 μm LY294002 resulted in marked inhibition of the insulin effects on [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 as well as glucose transport activity, suggesting that insulin activate guanine nucleotide exchange on the GTPase via a PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway.Figure 4Effects of wortmannin or LY294002 on [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 or glucose transport stimulated by insulin. Adipocytes in buffer X were incubated for 30 min and then permeabilized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the permeabilized cells were incubated for 10 min without or with 100 nm wortmannin or 50 μm LY294002, then incubated for 30 min with 50 μm [35S]GTPγS in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin. The amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to Rab4 was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the permeabilized cells were incubated for 10 min without or with 100 nm wortmannin or 50 μm LY294002, then incubated for 15 min in the absence (open column) or presence (hatched column) of 100 nm insulin. At the end of the incubation, the glucose transport activity was assayed. The results are the means ± S.D. of three determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 5 shows the effects of wortmannin on [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 in the basal and insulin-stimulated cells. Wortmannin inhibited the nucleotide binding to Rab4 stimulated by insulin in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximal concentration in the low nanomolar range. Intriguingly, wortmannin also attenuated the [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 in the basal cells, raising a possibility that PI 3-kinase activity may be necessary for guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4 even in the absence of insulin and that insulin may up-regulate the guanine nucleotide exchange activity by stimulating the lipid kinase. Finally, we examined the effect of wortmannin on insulin-induced subcellular redistribution of Rab4 in the electrically permeabilized adipocytes. As illustrated in Fig. 6, insulin induced a subcellular shift of Rab4 from the microsomal fraction to the soluble fraction. Pretreatrment of the cells with 100 nm wortmannin completely abolished the effect of insulin on the subcellular shift of Rab4 (Fig. 6). These results confirm the observation in intact adipocytes by Le Marchand-Brustel et al. (35Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Gautier N. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3564-3570Google Scholar) and suggest that activation of Rab4 may be accompanied with dissociation of the GTPase from the intracellular membrane. The Rab family of GTP-binding proteins is believed to function as regulators of intracellular membrane traffic (5Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Google Scholar). Among those, Rab4 has been shown to be associated with the early endosomes and to control recycling of cell surface receptors from the early endosomes to the plasma membrane (17Van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Goud B. Mellman I. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6313-6317Google Scholar, 18Klumperman J. Hille A. Veenendaal T. Oorschot V. Stoorvogel W. Von Figura K. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 997-1010Google Scholar). In addition, Rab4 has been recently demonstrated to be associated with GLUT4-containing vesicles in adipocytes (15Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Google Scholar) and muscles (35Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Gautier N. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3564-3570Google Scholar, 36Sherman L.A. Hirshman M.F. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Goodyear L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 266-273Google Scholar), and insulin stimulation leads to subcellular redistribution of the GTPase from the microsomal fraction to the soluble fraction (15Cormont M. Tanti J.-F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Google Scholar, 36Sherman L.A. Hirshman M.F. Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Goodyear L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 266-273Google Scholar). Although the translocation of GLUT4 well correlates with the redistribution of Rab4 in various situations (35Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Gautier N. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3564-3570Google Scholar, 37Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 42-44Google Scholar), the physiological significance of Rab4 GTPase in the insulin action has yet to be clarified. In the previous study, we reported that incorporation of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Rab4 hypervariable carboxyl-terminal domain into rat adipocytes considerably inhibited insulin stimulation of glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation (16Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Google Scholar), providing evidence that Rab4 is implicated in the insulin action on GLUT4 translocation. However, it still remains obscure whether Rab4 lies downstream of insulin receptor signaling and is activated by the hormone or the GTPase plays a more passive role in GLUT4 translocation, just like vesicle-associated membrane protein (38Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Google Scholar) or cellubrevin (39Volchuk A. Sargeant R. Sumitani S. Liu Z. He L. Klip A J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Google Scholar). To clarify this point, it is inevitable to measure the Rab4 activity in the absence and the presence of insulin. In this report, we assayed the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rab4 by using electrically permeabilized rat adipocytes. Although our method was basically same as that described by Ullrich et al. (26Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Google Scholar), our experimental system may have a few advantages. First, the electrically permeabilized cells are highly responsive to insulin (11Suzuki Y. Shibata H. Inoue S. Kojima I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 572-580Google Scholar, 24Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Google Scholar, 27Shibata H. Robinson F.W. Benzing C.F. Kono T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 97-104Google Scholar) compared with cells permeabilized with streptolysin O, which makes larger plasma membrane pores. Second, we measured [35S]GTPγS binding to endogenous Rab4 instead of overexpressed protein, making it possible to study the action of insulin under more physiological conditions. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated for the first time that insulin acutely stimulates [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 in electrically permeabilized rat adipocytes (Fig. 2), providing evidence that guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4 is activated by insulin. The stimulation by insulin of the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Rab4 was markedly inhibited with wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 4), both potent and specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, indicating that the lipid kinase may be an essential signaling component of the hormonal activation of Rab4. The stimulation by insulin of [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 well correlates with that of cellular glucose transport activity. First, the concentration-effect relationship of insulin stimulation of the nucleotide binding was in good accordance with that of glucose transport activity (Fig. 3). Second, the insulin-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 was inhibited with wortmannin with a half-maximal concentration in the low nanomolar range (Fig. 5), similar to that of the inhibition by wortmannin of glucose transport activity (29Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Google Scholar, 30Kanai F. Ito K. Todaka M. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Ishii K. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Ebina Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 762-768Google Scholar). These results, together with our previous observations (16Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Google Scholar), provide further evidence that activation of Rab4 may be one of possible mechanism(s) by which insulin promotes GLUT4 translocation. Interestingly, the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Rab4 in the basal cells was also inhibited considerably with wortmannin (Fig. 5), which has little effect on the basal glucose transport activity (29Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Google Scholar). Previous reports indicate that PI 3-kinase may be essential for the constitutive recycling of cell surface proteins, including transferrin receptor, insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor, and GLUT1 from the early endosomes to the plasma membrane (40Shepherd P.R. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 535-539Google Scholar, 41Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Google Scholar, 42Kaliman P. Vinals F. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 471-477Google Scholar). The inhibition with wortmannin of [35S]GTPγS binding to Rab4 in the basal cells (Fig. 5) suggests that, even in the absence of insulin, PI 3-kinase may be a critical regulator of guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4, which is necessary for the constitutive recycling of the cell surface proteins, and that insulin may up-regulate the exchange activity of Rab4 by activation of PI 3-kinase. We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that the insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase(s) may be distinct from other wortmannin-sensitive PI 3-kinase(s) regulating the constitutive endosomal recycling. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate this point. The discrepancy of the effects of wortmannin on Rab4 activity and glucose transport in the basal cells seems in good agreement with our previous report (24Shibata H. Suzuki Y. Omata W. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11489-11495Google Scholar) that, in the absence of insulin, most of GLUT4 molecules may be in the compartment(s) outside of the constitutive endosomal recycling pathway regulated by Rab4 and also suggests that GLUT4-containing vesicles may pause en route to the cell surface by unknown mechanism despite the presence of Rab4 on the vesicles. At present, the precise molecular mechanism of the insulin stimulation of guanine nucleotide exchange on Rab4 is unclear. The activity of Rab family GTPase is regulated primarily by two regulatory proteins (43Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Google Scholar); one is guanine nucleotide exchange factor(s) which positively regulates Rab proteins by accelerating GDP dissociation and subsequent GTP binding and another is GTPase-activating protein (GAP) which inactivates Rab by stimulating GTP hydrolysis on Rab GTPase. Recently, Bortoluzzi et al. (44Bortoluzzi M.-N. Cormont M. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 899-906Google Scholar) reported GAP activity for Rab4 in the membrane fraction of 3T3-L1 cells, although insulin had no effect on the Rab4-GAP activity or its subcellular localization. Our present data provides the first evidence that insulin may activate as yet unidentified guanine nucleotide exchange factor(s) for Rab4 and an important insight as to the molecular mechanism(s) of insulin stimulation of glucose transport. In summary, the present study clearly demonstrated for the first time that insulin activates Rab4 by accelerating guanine nucleotide exchange on the GTPase in rat adipocytes. The activation by insulin of Rab4 was wortmannin- and LY294002-sensitive, suggesting Rab4 lies downstream of the insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase. Our results indicate that Rab4 is one of the intracellular targets of insulin action on the vesicle traffic including GLUT4 translocation."

Previous studies by others have shown that some forms of familial male precocious puberty are associated with mutations of the human LHR in the sixth transmembrane region that result in constitutive activation of the receptor. This study demonstrates that a peptide corresponding to the lower portion of the sixth transmembrane region of the LHR can significantly activate adenylyl cyclase activity. Experiments with membranes derived from wild-type versus cyc − S49 cells demonstrate that the stimulation of cyclase by this peptide is due to an activation of Gs. As such, our data demonstrate a direct role for transmembrane region 6 of the rat LHR in activating Gs and therefore raise the possibility that mutations in transmembrane region 6 of the LHR may directly affect the coupling of the receptor to Gs. Significantly, these data are the first to demonstrate the ability of a transmembrane portion of a G protein-coupled receptor, in the absence of any contributions from an intracellular loop region, to activate a G protein.

The LHR 1The abbreviations used are:LHRluteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor;rLHRrat LHR;hLHRhuman LHR;hCGhuman chorionic gonadotropin;GDPβSguanosine 5′-O-2-(thio)diphosphate. is a large cell-surface glycoprotein with the characteristic structure of a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (1McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 494-499Google Scholar). This structure includes the presence of seven putative membrane-spanning regions connected by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops, an extracellular N-terminal extension, and an intracellular cytoplasmic tail (1McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 494-499Google Scholar, 2Rodriguez M.C. Segaloff D.L. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 674-681Google Scholar). The rLHR is capable of binding either luteinizing hormone or chorionic gonadotropin with high affinity, resulting in the activation of Gs and adenylyl cyclase and the production of cAMP (1McFarland K.C.

Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347Google Scholar). Although cAMP is responsible for eliciting most of the significant effects of the rLHR, at high receptor densities and in the presence of high concentrations of hormone, the rLHR also activates phospholipase C (4Gudermann T.

Many studies of different members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily have focused on the determination of the sites of these receptors that physically interact with G proteins. Utilizing multiple approaches such as chimeric receptors, synthetic peptides, and deletion/substitution mutagenesis, several investigators have determined that the N- and C-terminal portions of the third intracellular loop are essential for the interaction of the adrenergic receptors with their respective G proteins (6Liggett S.B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hnatowich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4816-4821Google Scholar, 7Cheung A.H. Huang R.-R.C. Graziano M.P. Strader C.D.

Additionally, similar experiments with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors have revealed that the third intracellular loop determines the subtype-specific coupling of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to distinct G proteins, with the N- and C-terminal portions of the third intracellular loop being absolutely required for activation of their respective G proteins (9Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Google Scholar, 10Liu J. Blin N. Conklin B.R. Wess J. J. Biol.

More important, the third intracellular loop is not the site of G protein interaction for all G protein-coupled receptors. For example, experiments utilizing synthetic peptides and fusion proteins corresponding to regions of the human neutrophilN-formylpeptide receptor demonstrated the importance of the second intracellular loop and the N-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic tail for the coupling of this receptor to Gi (12Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 326-331Google Scholar). The sites of interaction of the LHR with Gs are not well defined. However, several of the activating mutations found to be associated with familial male precocious puberty have been found to occur in the lower portion of transmembrane 6 and in the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the hLHR (13Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Google Scholar, 14Latronico A.C. Anasti J. Arnhold I.J.P. Mendonca B.B. Domenice S. Albano M.C.

These mutations are thought to activate the receptor by altering the packing of the transmembrane helices and/or by exposing intracellular regions, which can then interact with Gs. The identification of these activating mutations has led investigators to hypothesize that the third intracellular loop of the LHR may be important for the coupling of this receptor to Gs (13Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to identify regions of the LHR that interact with Gs. Because mutation of the LHR frequently results in intracellular retention of mutant receptors (3Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347Google Scholar, 18Thomas D. Rozell T.G. Liu X.

Hence, the following studies were performed by examining the ability of synthetic peptides corresponding to regions of the rLHR to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. Based upon the studies of the adrenergic receptors and upon mutations of the LHR causing familial male precocious puberty, we chose to focus initially on the third intracellular loop and sixth transmembrane region of the rLHR. As shown herein, our results clearly demonstrate a role for transmembrane 6 of the LHR in the activation of Gs. Highly purified hCG (CR-127) was provided by the National Hormone and Pituitary Agency of NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. GDPβS, alumina WN-3, and reagents for adenylyl cyclase assays were obtained from Sigma. AG-50W-X4 resin was purchased from Bio-Rad, and [α-32P]ATP was from DuPont NEN. Tissue culture reagents and plasticware were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and Corning Inc. (Corning, NY), respectively. rLHR peptides were synthesized as C-terminal amides and were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography to >95% purity. Peptides were synthesized either by Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA) or by the Mayo Protein Core Facility, Mayo Foundation (Rochester, MN). As a control for the different peptide sources, some peptides were synthesized by both vendors and were found to have identical properties. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), which do not express the rLHR, were maintained in a high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 mm Hepes, and 10% newborn calf serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The clonal stable 293 cell line rLHR-wt12, expressing ∼150,000 rLHR receptors/cell, was generously donated by Dr. Mario Ascoli (University of Iowa) (5Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-758Google Scholar). rLHR-wt12 cells were maintained as described above and supplemented with 700 μg/ml Geneticin. S49 wild-type and cyc − mouse lymphoma cell lines were obtained from the Cell Culture Facility, University of California, San Francisco. S49 wild-type cells were grown in stationary suspensions in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 mmHepes, and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. S49 cyc − cells, which lack Gαs (26Miller R.T. Masters S. Sullivan K. Beiderman B. Bourne H. Nature. 1988; 334: 712-715Google Scholar), were derived from S49 wild-type cells (27Salomon M.R. Bourne H.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 109-116Google Scholar) and were maintained as described above for S49 wild-type cells. For the preparation of 293 membranes, confluent 100-mm dishes were set on ice for 15 min and washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (250 mmsucrose, 25 mm Tris-Cl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Cells were scraped from the dishes; the dishes were rinsed with cold buffer A; and the contents were combined. The cell suspension was centrifuged (2200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C); the supernatant was aspirated; and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mm Tris-Cl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml and vortexed. 8-ml aliquots (1.6 × 108 cells/tube) were vortexed and kept on ice for 15 min to lyse the cells. Each aliquot was homogenized (Ultra-Turrax T25, Kandel IKA Labortechnick, Staufen, Germany) at 22,000 rpm using 10 bursts of 5 s each with 10 s between each burst. Homogenates were centrifuged (470 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the post-nuclear supernatant was then centrifuged (100,000 ×g, 45 min, 4 °C) to obtain a membrane pellet. The membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer B (0.8 ml of 125 mm Tris-Cl and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) by hand homogenization 10 times using a Teflon-glass homogenizer. The membranes were pelleted (2200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in buffer A, and aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen. Before use, aliquots were thawed on ice, and membranes were pelleted (2200 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended by vortexing in buffer B. Crude preparations of S49 wild-type andcyc − cell membranes were prepared as described by Ross et al. (28Ross E.M. Maguire M.E. Sturgill T.W. Biltonen R.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5761-5775Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase assays were performed as described by Salomon (29Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55Google Scholar). For experiments with 293 cell membranes, 10 μg of membranes in 10 μl of buffer B were preincubated with increasing concentrations of the individual rLHR peptides (dissolved in 10 μl of 10% Me2SO) for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by 15 min at 4 °C. After preincubation, the following components were added: 10 μl of 75 μg/ml hCG in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, and 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, or 10 μl of buffer only; 10 μl of 100 μm GTP; and 10 μl of a reaction mixture containing 0.5 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm cAMP, 100 mm phosphocreatine, 200 units/ml creatine kinase, 200 units/ml myokinase, 3 μCi/ml [3H]cAMP, and 140 μCi/ml [α-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of stop solution (40 mm ATP, 10 mm cAMP, and 1% SDS) and by boiling for 3 min. [32P]cAMP formed was separated from other32P-nucleotides by sequential chromatography through Dowex anion-exchange columns and alumina columns as described previously (29Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55Google Scholar). Scintillation fluid was added to the eluant, and samples were counted for 5 min. Cyclase assays with S49 cell membranes were performed essentially as described above for 293 membranes with the following modifications. 10 μg of S49 membranes in 10 μl of 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, were preincubated with rLHR peptides for 15 min at 30 °C with shaking, followed by 15 min at 4 °C. After preincubation, the following components were added: 10 μl of 230 mm Hepes and 4 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; 10 μl of 250 μm GTP; and 10 μl of the reaction mixture described above, except that MgCl2 was included at 50 mminstead of 20 mm. The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with shaking. Reactions were terminated; radiolabeled nucleotides were separated; and samples were counted as described above for 293 membrane cyclase assays. For assays measuring the GDPβS-induced inhibition of rLHR peptide-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, GTP (final concentration of 20 μm) was substituted with GDPβS (final concentration of 6 μm). Membranes were incubated with the indicated rLHR peptide (final concentration of 30 μm), with a saturating concentration of hCG (final concentration of 15 μg/ml), or with 100 μm forskolin. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured essentially as described above. To determine the role of the third intracellular loop and transmembrane 6 regions of the rLHR in the activation of Gs, peptide I3/TM6, corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop and the lower portion of transmembrane region 6, was synthesized (Fig. 1 and TableI). As a control for I3/TM6, peptide E1/TM2 was also synthesized. As shown in Fig. 1, peptide E1/TM2 represents the N-terminal portion of the first extracellular loop and the upper portion of transmembrane 2, a region that should not be directly involved in the coupling of the rLHR to Gs. These peptides were then tested for their ability to either activate Gs or competitively inhibit the interaction of the rLHR with Gs. Membranes prepared from 293 cells expressing the wild-type rLHR were incubated with increasing concentrations of either peptide E1/TM2 or I3/TM6 in the absence or presence of a maximally stimulatory concentration of hCG, and adenylyl cyclase activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, E1/TM2 had no effect on either basal or hormone-stimulated cyclase activity, whereas I3/TM6 markedly altered adenylyl cyclase activity. Low concentrations of I3/TM6 (30 μm) stimulated basal cyclase activity ∼3-fold (Fig.2 B). The magnitude of this response is similar to that elicited by a maximal concentration of hCG (Fig. 2 A). When membranes were incubated in the presence of both a maximal concentration of hCG and 30 μm I3/TM6, this peptide produced a further 3-fold increase in cyclase activity above the 3-fold stimulation by hCG alone (Fig. 2 C). In addition to the stimulatory effects of low concentrations of I3/TM6, high concentrations (300 μm) of I3/TM6 produced a significant inhibition of both basal and hormone-stimulated cyclase activity (Fig.2, B and C). Both the activating and inhibitory actions of the I3/TM6 peptide on basal adenylyl cyclase activity were independent of the presence of the full-length rLHR as similar activities were observed in membranes prepared from untransfected 293 cells that do not express the rLHR (Fig. 3).Table IPeptides were synthesized with the indicated sequences, free amino-terminal ends, and amidated carboxyl-terminal ends as described under “Materials and Methods”PeptideSequenceI3/TM6TAPNKDTKIAKKMAILIFTTM6KMAILIFTTM6(L552P)KMAIPIFTTM6-scr1KFIMLTIATM6-scr2MKIIATFLE1/TM2LLIASVDSQTKGQYYNHAITM2upLLIASVDSI3RIYFAVQNPELTAPNKDTKIAKKI3/TM2TAPNKDTKIAKKVSAILLThe locations of the sequences corresponding to peptides I3/TM6 and E1/TM2 are shown in Fig. 1.

Experiments with other G protein-coupled receptors such as the β2-adrenergic receptor would suggest that it is the I3 portion of I3/TM6 that is responsible for the activity of this peptide (6Liggett S.B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hnatowich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4816-4821Google Scholar, 7Cheung A.H. Huang R.-R.C. Graziano M.P. Strader C.D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 277-280Google Scholar). To address this possibility, peptide I3 (Table I), corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the rLHR, was tested for activity. Over a range of 1–300 μm, however, I3 was found to have no effect on either basal or hCG-stimulated cyclase activity (data not shown). Since it is possible that the lack of activity of the I3 peptide was due to the absence of a hydrophobic sequence that would enhance its association with membranes, an I3/TM2 peptide (Table I) was also examined. This peptide, in which the C-terminal portion of the I3 sequence is now followed by a hydrophobic sequence corresponding to the upper portion of the second transmembrane helix, however, was also devoid of any stimulatory or inhibitory activity (data not shown). The lack of activity of the I3 and I3/TM2 peptides and the identification of several activating mutations in the lower portion of transmembrane 6 of the hLHR (13Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Google Scholar, 15Kosugi S. Van Dop C. Geffner M.E. Rabl W. Carel J.C. Chaussain J.L. Mori T. Merendino Jr., J.J. Shenker A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 183-188Google Scholar) raised the possibility that the TM6 portion itself may be responsible for at least some of the activity of the I3/TM6 peptide (13Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Google Scholar, 15Kosugi S. Van Dop C. Geffner M.E. Rabl W. Carel J.C. Chaussain J.L. Mori T. Merendino Jr., J.J. Shenker A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 183-188Google Scholar). To address this question, peptide TM6, corresponding to the lower portion of transmembrane 6, was synthesized (Fig. 1 and Table I). When incubated with membranes expressing the rLHR, 10–56 μm TM6 peptide stimulated both basal and hormone-stimulated cyclase activity ∼2-fold (Fig. 2, B andC). Much higher concentrations of peptide TM6 inhibited both basal and hormone-stimulated cyclase activity, but to a lesser extent than the I3/TM6 peptide (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar to the I3/TM6 peptide, the activity of the TM6 peptide was independent of the presence of the full-length rLHR as activity was present in 293 membranes (Fig. 3). These data show that the residues corresponding to the lower portion of transmembrane 6 are responsible for a significant part of the activity of the I3/TM6 peptide. Control peptides were synthesized to demonstrate the specificity of the TM6 amino acid sequence for the activation of Gs. For these purposes, peptide TM6(L552P), corresponding to peptide TM6 but with the substitution of a leucine with a disruptive proline, was synthesized (Table I). In addition, peptide TM2up, corresponding to amino acids 391–398 (LLIASVDS), representing the upper portion of transmembrane 2, was synthesized (Table I). More important, unlike the TM6 peptide, the TM6(L552P) and TM2up peptides had no stimulatory or inhibitory effects on either basal (Fig. 4 A) or hormone-stimulated (data not shown) cyclase activity, suggesting a structural basis for the activity of TM6. In addition to these two control peptides, randomly scrambled versions of the TM6 peptide, designated TM6-scr1 and TM6-scr2 (Table I), were prepared. Interestingly, both scrambled peptides were capable of stimulating basal (Fig. 4 B) and hormone-stimulated (data not shown) cyclase activity, identical to the parent TM6 peptide; however, both peptides inhibited cyclase activity at much lower concentrations of peptide. To determine whether the I3/TM6 and TM6 peptides were interacting directly with Gs to stimulate cyclase activity, as opposed to nonspecifically affecting adenylyl cyclase, the GTP dependence of the stimulation by these peptides was examined. Membranes prepared from 293 cells expressing the rLHR were incubated either in the presence of GTP or in the absence of GTP and the presence of the G protein inhibitor GDPβS. The ability of GDPβS to inhibit the activation of cyclase activity by a stimulatory dose (30 μm) of peptide was then examined. As controls, the effects of GDPβS on forskolin- and hCG-stimulated cyclase activity were also examined. As would be expected, GDPβS significantly decreased hCG-stimulated cyclase activity, whereas it had little effect on forskolin-stimulated cyclase activity (Fig. 5). The results in Fig. 5 show that GDPβS markedly decreased the stimulatory activities of both the I3/TM6 and TM6 peptides, suggesting that low concentrations of these peptides act directly on Gs to stimulate cyclase activity. To more definitively demonstrate the interaction of rLHR peptides with Gs, the effects of the I3/TM6, TM6, and TM6(L552P) peptides were examined in membranes prepared from wild-type versus cyc − S49 cells. As shown in Fig.6 A, S49 wild-type membranes demonstrated both sodium fluoride- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. As expected, S49 cyc − membranes, which lack Gαs (26Miller R.T. Masters S. Sullivan K. Beiderman B. Bourne H. Nature. 1988; 334: 712-715Google Scholar), showed no detectable basal cyclase activity or stimulation of cyclase by NaF, but did exhibit forskolin-stimulated cyclase activity similar to that measured in S49 wild-type membranes (Fig. 6 A). Examination of I3/TM6 peptide activity showed that low concentrations of I3/TM6 (10–56 μm) produced a 3-fold stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 wild-type membranes similar to that observed in 293 membranes (Fig.6 B). Interestingly, this 3-fold stimulation was maintained in S49 wild-type membranes even at very high concentrations of peptide I3/TM6, concentrations that inhibited 293 membrane cyclase activity (cf. Figs. 3 and 6 B). Similar to 293 membranes, low concentrations of peptide TM6 (10–56 μm) produced an ∼2-fold increase in cyclase activity in S49 wild-type membranes (Fig.6 B). However, unlike the moderate inhibition of cyclase activity in 293 membranes by higher concentrations of peptide TM6, higher concentrations of peptide TM6 produced a further increase in S49 wild-type cyclase activity to ∼4–5-fold of basal cyclase activity (cf. Figs. 3 and 6 B). The control peptide TM6(L552P) had no effect on S49 wild-type cyclase activity (Fig.6 B). The ability of the TM6 and I3/TM6 peptides to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity was then examined in S49cyc − cell membranes. As shown in Fig.6 B, the cyclase activity observed over all concentrations of both peptides tested was undetectable. The ability of the TM6 and I3/TM6 peptides to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in S49 wild-type cell membranes, but not in S49 cyc − cell membranes, clearly demonstrates the requirement for Gs in the stimulatory activity of the peptides upon adenylyl cyclase. As such, we conclude that the TM6 and I3/TM6 peptides interact directly with Gs, thereby causing its activation. This study was undertaken to better define the role of the third intracellular loop and transmembrane region 6 of the LHR in the activation of G proteins. Toward this end, peptides corresponding to various portions of these regions of the rLHR were tested for their ability to activate adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes prepared from 293 cells. Since the peptides were also assayed for potential stimulatory or inhibitory activity in membranes derived from 293 cells expressing the recombinant rLHR, we chose to use the rLHR sequence as the basis for the design of these peptides. It should be noted, however, that there is a very high degree of amino acid sequence identity between the rat and human LHRs within the third intracellular loop and transmembrane 6 regions. As such, peptide I3/TM6 (corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop and the lower portion of transmembrane 6) is identical to the hLHR except for two residues within the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop. Consequently, peptide TM6, which corresponds only to the lower portion of transmembrane 6, is the same for the rLHR and hLHR. The data presented provide evidence of a direct interaction of transmembrane region 6 of the LHR with Gs. When present at concentrations of 10–100 μm, the TM6 peptide (corresponding to the lower portion of TM6) was able to stimulate both basal and hCG-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. This stimulatory activity is mediated by Gs, as peptide activity is present in S49 wild-type membranes, but is absent in S49cyc − membranes, which lack Gαs(26Miller R.T. Masters S. Sullivan K. Beiderman B. Bourne H. Nature. 1988; 334: 712-715Google Scholar). More important, experiments with control peptides for the TM6 peptide suggest that the activity of the TM6 peptide requires some specific, disruptable sequence. For example, the equally hydrophobic peptide TM2up failed to alter cyclase activity, demonstrating that a string of predominantly hydrophobic amino acids is not sufficient to activate Gs. In addition, a leucine to proline substitution in the TM6 peptide resulted in a peptide with no activity, indicating that the TM6 peptide has a specific structure that is disruptable. However, clearly the amino acid sequence requirements of the TM6 peptide are not absolute as scrambled TM6 peptides had similar activating properties as the parent TM6 peptide. Results from experiments with the scrambled TM6 peptides were not entirely unexpected since the scrambled TM6 peptides consist almost entirely of homologous hydrophobic substitutions, and many researchers have shown that homologous substitutions are often well tolerated (30Hill-Eubanks D. Burnstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brauner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3058-3065Google Scholar, 31Burnstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3141-3146Google Scholar, 32Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Google Scholar). Taken all together, the results presented suggest that the TM6 peptide possesses some specific amino acid sequence and structure necessary for its activation of Gs. More important, these results are the first to demonstrate an interaction of a transmembrane region of a G protein-coupled receptor with a G protein. In addition to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by TM6, a longer peptide, I3/TM6 (corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop and the lower portion of transmembrane 6), stimulated cyclase activity. The effects of the I3/TM6 peptide appear to be specific since a control peptide, E1/TM2 (corresponding to a portion of the first extracellular loop and the upper portion of transmembrane 2), had no effect on cyclase activity. Also, the effects of the I3/TM6 peptide were independent of the presence of the full-length rLHR. In addition, the I3/TM6 peptide acted directly on Gs as activation was present in S49 wild-type membranes, but was absent in S49 cyc − membranes. However, the I3/TM6 peptide stimulated cyclase activity more effectively than the TM6 peptide, suggesting that the I3 portion of the peptide may be responsible for some of the activity of the I3/TM6 peptide and that the I3 portion may interact with Gs. Surprisingly, examination of other peptides revealed that neither the I3 peptide (corresponding to the full third intracellular loop of the rLHR) nor the I3/TM2 peptide (corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop followed by a hydrophobic anchor derived from the upper portion of transmembrane region 2) had any effects on basal or hormone-stimulated cyclase activity. Based upon the β2-adrenergic receptor paradigm, it is generally assumed that the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the LHR is involved in the activation of Gs. However, the only data thus far on the LHR to support this hypothesis come from the observations that some constitutively activating mutations of the hLHR result from single amino acid substitutions within the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop (14Latronico A.C. Anasti J. Arnhold I.J.P. Mendonca B.B. Domenice S. Albano M.C. Zachman K. Wajchenberg B.L. Tsigos C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1995; 80: 2490-2494Google Scholar, 17Laue L. Chan W.-Y. Hsueh A. Kudo M. Hsu S.Y. Wu S. Blomberg L. Cutler G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1906-1910Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that substitution of the three lysine residues in the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the rLHR (present also in the hLHR) to alanines had no adverse effects on either basal or hormone-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the mutant receptor (20Wang H. Jaquette J. Collison K. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1437-1444Google Scholar). While these results do not necessarily rule out a role for this region of the LHR in activating Gs, they do demonstrate that an amphiphilic helical structure of the C-terminal region of the third intracellular loop is certainly not required for activation of Gs by the rLHR. Clearly, more studies need to be performed to address the role of the third intracellular loop of the LHR in Gs activation. There are therefore several possible reasons why the I3 and I3/TM2 peptides did not exhibit any stimulatory activity in this study. These include the possibility that the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the LHR does not directly interact with Gs (and the constitutively activating mutations may be causing allosteric changes in transmembrane 6). Alternatively, although the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the LHR may interact with Gs, stimulation of Gs may occur only by the coordinated interaction of this region with one or more other regions of the receptor. It may also be that these peptides are interacting with Gs, but in a nonproductive manner distinct from the interaction of the LHR with Gs. Finally, one cannot exclude the possibility that these peptides are simply not assuming the same conformation as the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the full-length LHR. In addition to the stimulation of cyclase by low concentrations of peptides I3/TM6 and TM6, very high concentrations of both peptides I3/TM6 and TM6 were able to inhibit 293 membrane adenylyl cyclase activity. However, this inhibition was severely reduced or completely absent in S49 wild-type membranes. Whether the inhibitory activity of these peptides in 293 cells is due to interactions of the peptides with Gi or due to nonspecific inhibition of G protein activity remains to be determined. In either case, the results would not be relevant to the overall conclusion that lower (i.e. more physiologically relevant) concentrations of these peptides exert stimulatory effects on Gs that are independent of cell type. Many investigators have identified regions of G protein-coupled receptors that possess the ability to activate G proteins. For example, peptides corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of both the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors were each capable of stimulating Gs (7Cheung A.H. Huang R.-R.C. Graziano M.P. Strader C.D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 277-280Google Scholar, 8Okamoto T. Yoshitake M. Hayashi Y. Inagaki M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1991; 67: 723-730Google Scholar). In addition, a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the m4-acetylcholine receptor was capable of directly stimulating both Gi and Go (11Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Google Scholar). Also, a peptide corresponding to a cytoplasmic region and a portion of the transmembrane segment of the single transmembrane insulin-like growth factor/mannose 6-phosphate receptor was capable of activating Gi, but a peptide corresponding to the transmembrane portion alone had no effect on Gi activity (33Okamoto T. Katada T. Murayama Y. Ui M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1990; 62: 709-717Google Scholar). More important, this report is the first to our knowledge to identify a peptide corresponding to a transmembrane region of a G protein-coupled receptor that has the ability to directly activate a G protein. Recent studies have suggested that transmembrane 6 of the hLHR is involved in interhelical interactions (34Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22470-22478Google Scholar). If this suggestion turns out to be correct, our results suggest that in addition to contributing to interhelical interactions, the lower portion of transmembrane 6 of the LHR is also capable of interacting with and activating Gs. Interestingly, many mutations associated with familial male precocious puberty occur in this lower portion of transmembrane 6 of the hLHR (13Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Google Scholar, 14Latronico A.C. Anasti J. Arnhold I.J.P. Mendonca B.B. Domenice S. Albano M.C. Zachman K. Wajchenberg B.L. Tsigos C. J. Clin.

Our data would further suggest that constitutive activation of hLHRs observed with transmembrane 6 mutations that cause familial male precocious puberty may be due to changes in the interaction of the lower portion of transmembrane 6 with Gs, as opposed to or in addition to allosteric changes in the conformation of the third intracellular loop. Recently, Liu et al. (10Liu J. Blin N. Conklin B.R. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6172-6178Google Scholar) demonstrated that the insertion of one to four alanines into the lower portion of transmembrane 6 of the m2-acetylcholine receptor resulted in constitutively activated receptors. They proposed that the activation of this receptor involved the movement of transmembrane 6 toward the cytoplasm (10Liu J. Blin N. Conklin B.R. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6172-6178Google Scholar). This model is consistent with our identification of the lower portion of transmembrane 6 of the LHR directly activating Gs. Whether this region of the rLHR activates Gs while in the membrane or whether it is exposed to the cytoplasm when hormone binds remains to be determined. We thank Drs.

Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with an extracellular ligand, RTKs dimerize and transphosphorylate (2Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar). This tyrosine phosphorylation enables the recruitment of signaling molecules containing SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains that recognize phosphotyrosines within specific amino acid motifs (3Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Google Scholar). In this way, the SH2 domain-containing adaptors for Class IA PI3Ks (43Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem.

Each of these adaptors contains two SH2 domains, both of which selectively bind peptides containing phosphotyrosine with a methionine at the +3 position (pYXXM) (14Panayotou G. Gish G. End P.

Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar), and an inter-SH2 domain, which mediates binding to Class IA PI3Ks (16Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Google Scholar). The p85α and p85β adaptors also contain an SH3 domain and a BH domain at the N terminus, whereas p55PIK and two splice variants of p85α have short N-terminal extensions. Despite this structural diversity, there has been no reported selectivity of binding between different adaptors and p110α, β, or δ (44Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. 1997; Google Scholar).We are using Drosophila to examine the role of the Class IA PI3Ks genetically and to provide an in vivosystem to identify downstream targets. Many molecules downstream of RTKs in Drosophila are structurally and functionally homologous to their mammalian counterparts. The best characterized example of this is the Ras/MAPK pathway downstream of the Sevenless,Drosophila EGF receptor and Torso RTKs (17Wassarman D.A. Therrien M. Rubin G.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 44-50Google Scholar).Drosophila possesses a Class IA PI3K, Dp110 (also known as PI3K_92E), which is homologous to mammalian Class IA PI3Ks (18MacDougall L.K. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1404-1415Google Scholar, 19Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the ectopic expression of Dp110 in larval imaginal discs affects cell growth but not cell differentiation (19Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Google Scholar).Here we present the affinity purification of p60, the adaptor for Dp110, using immobilized phosphopeptides containing the pYXXM motif. Peptides derived from the purified protein were sequenced, and degenerate PCR and cDNA cloning were used to isolate the p60 cDNA. The structural and functional conservation of p60 with the mammalian adaptors is discussed. The Dp110·p60 complex possessed lipid and protein kinase activity and was found inDrosophila larvae, pupae, and adults and the S2 cell line. The genomic structure and location of the p60 gene has been determined to facilitate the identification and generation of genetic reagents to study the function of this PI3K adaptor in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLysate Preparation and Affinity PurificationS2 cell lysates were prepared essentially as described (19Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Google Scholar) by lysis in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 18 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 mm benzamidine. Detergent lysates of Oregon R third instar larvae, pupae, and adult flies were prepared in the same buffer, but which additionally contained 5 μm diisopropylfluorophosphate and 15 μm N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, by homogenization with a polytron (2 × 10 s, on ice). The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 1 h and then at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Affinity purification using phosphopeptide coupled to Actigel (Sterogene) beads was performed as described (19Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Google Scholar).Peptide Microsequencing and cDNA CloningProteins affinity purified from approximately 1010 S2 cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R250. Each band was excised and digested with lysyl endopeptidase C (Wako Chemicals), and the resulting peptides were resolved by passage through an AX-300 pre-column and then a C18 (150 × 1 mm) column (Relasil). The peptides were sequenced at the 500 fmol level using an ABI Procise system. Peptides 6 and 9 (see Fig. 2 A) were used to design the degenerate primers, CA(A/G)GA(A/G)(C/T)TITT(C/T)CA(C/T)TA(C/T)ATGGA and (C/G)(A/T)IACIGT(C/T)TC(A/G)TAIA(A/G)(C/T)TG(C/T)TG, respectively. Poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared from S2 cells using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Stratagene) and used to synthesize first strand cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). PCR reactions were performed with cDNA as a template and 0.025 units/μl Taq, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 1 μmeach primer in a total volume of 50 μl. 40 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s) were performed. The 200-base pair product obtained was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), sequenced, and found to encode peptides 7 and 8 (see Fig. 2 A). This fragment was used to screen a λgt10 eye imaginal disc cDNA library (A. Cowan), and four positive clones were isolated that appeared to be identical by restriction mapping and by sequencing of the 5′ and 3′ ends. One clone was digested with EcoRI, and the two resulting fragments were subcloned into pBluescript SKII (Stratagene). PCR and direct sequencing of the original lambda clone showed the two fragments to be adjacent. Each fragment was sequenced in both directions with T3, T7, and p60-specific primers on an ABI 373 automated DNA sequencer.Immunological MethodsPeptides corresponding to the N terminus (CGGMQPSPLHYSTMRPQ, CGGSLVDPNEDELRMA) and the C terminus (CGGLYWKNNPLQVQMIQLQE, CGGSLEAEAAPASISPSNFSTSQ) of p60, including a CGG coupling linker at the N terminus, were coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin as directed (Pierce). Antibodies were raised in rabbits against pools of N-terminal (αp60N) and C-terminal antigens (αp60C). Immunoblotting was performed using αDp110 (1:1000) (19Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Google Scholar), αp60N (1:1000), or αp60C (1:2000) and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence as directed (Amersham Life Science). Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the lysate with a 1:200 dilution of antisera (6 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C and then adding protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) beads and incubating for an additional 30 min. The beads were washed in the same manner as the peptide-coupled beads (19Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Google Scholar).Kinase AssaysFor the lipid and protein kinase assays, the beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA. Lipid kinase assays were performed essentially as described (20Whitman M. Kaplan D. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Google Scholar) in 60 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 100 μm ATP containing 2.5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and 200 μm sonicated phosphatidylinositol (Sigma). The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and terminated with acidified chloroform, and the lipid was extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol/4 m ammonium hydroxide (45:35:10). Protein kinase assays were performed in 30 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP containing 2.5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels.RESULTSAffinity Purification of the Dp110·p60 Complex from Drosophila S2 CellsPhosphopeptides, containing one or both of the pYXXM motifs found at positions 740 and 751 of the human PDGFβ receptor, bind selectively to the adaptors for Class IA PI3Ks (14Panayotou G. Gish G. End P. Truong O. Gout I. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Hiles I. Pawson T. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3567-3576Google Scholar). When coupled to agarose beads, these phosphopeptides can be used to affinity purify heterodimeric complexes containing the adaptors bound to Class IA PI3Ks (9Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Fry M. Ruiz-Larrea F. Panayotou G. Thompson A. Dhand R. Hsuan J. Totty N. Smith A.D. Morgan S.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 91-104Google Scholar, 21Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Dhand R. Ruiz Larrea F. Gout I. Nguyen O. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 383-393Google Scholar). We investigated whether this approach could be used to identify an adaptor for Dp110, the Drosophila Class IA PI3K. Three proteins of approximately 145, 120, and 60 kDa were affinity purified from Drosophila S2 cells, using the tyrosine phosphorylated peptide GGYMDMSKDESVDpYVPML (pY751) coupled to agarose beads (Fig.1). The same proteins were purified when the peptide was phosphorylated on tyrosine 740 or on both tyrosine 740 and tyrosine 751, but they were not recovered with beads lacking peptide (data not shown). The affinity purified complex possessed lipid and protein kinase activities, and immunoblotting with αDp110 antisera showed that the 120-kDa protein was Dp110 (see below). We washed the complex at high stringency to determine which of the remaining bands was the adaptor for Dp110. Washing with lysis buffer containing increasing concentrations of sodium chloride removed the majority of the 145-kDa band, suggesting that p60 was the adaptor (Fig. 1). A large scale affinity purification was performed, and peptides derived from p60, p120, and p145 were sequenced (see “Experimental Procedures”). Three of the peptide sequences obtained from p120 confirmed that it was Dp110 (LMANYTGL, EYQVYGISTFN, and LHVLE). Two peptides sequenced from p145, FMEXIYTDVR and FXNNXXCGYIL, revealed that this protein wasDrosophila phospholipase Cγ (PLCγD) (22Emori Y. Sugaya R. Akimaru H. Higashijima S. Shishido E. Saigo K. Homma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19474-19479Google Scholar). Interestingly, human PLCγ can be affinity purified from human cell lines using the same pYXXM phosphopeptide 2I. Gout, personal communication. , and the C-terminal SH2 domain of mammalian PLCγ can interact with pYXXM motifs (14Panayotou G. Gish G. End P. Truong O. Gout I. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Hiles I. Pawson T. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3567-3576Google Scholar) though it binds preferentially to phosphotyrosines in other sequence contexts (15Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar). Nine peptide sequences were obtained from p60 and used to design degenerate PCR primers. PCR amplification from first strand cDNA derived from S2 cell mRNA generated a 200-base pair fragment that was used to isolate p60 cDNAs from an eye imaginal disc cDNA library (see “Experimental Procedures”). These cDNAs contained an open reading frame that could encode a protein with a predicted size of 57.5 kDa, which contains all nine of the peptide sequences recovered from p60 (Fig. 2 A).Figure 1Affinity purification of p120 and p60 using the pY751 peptide implicates p60 as the adaptor for Dp110. Lysates from approximately 108 S2 cells were used for each sample. The final washes were carried out in buffer containing the indicated concentrations of NaCl, resolved by SDS -PAGE, and silver stained. p145 was removed at higher salt concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sequence Analysis of p60Like the other identified adaptors for Class IA PI3Ks, the predicted amino acid sequence of p60 includes two SH2 domains and an inter-SH2 domain. However, the SH3 and BH domains in p85α and β, the N-terminal extensions in p55PIK and the p55α splice variants, and the proline-rich SH3 domain-binding motifs (23Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Google Scholar) found in all mammalian adaptors are absent in p60 (Fig. 2 B). p60 has a short N terminus (similar in size to the N terminus of p50α, a recently isolated splice variant of p85α (12Fruman D. Cantley L. Carpenter C. Genomics. 1996; 37: 113-121Google Scholar)), and a unique C terminus of 70 amino acids that shows no significant similarity to other proteins. When the amino acid sequences of the core SH2–inter-SH2–SH2 region of p60, p85α, p85β, and p55PIK are compared, p60 shows an equal degree of similarity to all three mammalian adaptors (Fig. 2 A, data not shown).The N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 domains are the most conserved regions of p60 and are 58% and 48% identical to the respective domains of bovine p85α. The three-dimensional structures of the N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85α in complex with pYXXM phosphopeptides have been determined by x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (24Nolte R. Eck M. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S. Harrison S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 364-373Google Scholar, 25Breeze A. Kara B. Barratt D. Anderson M. Smith J. Luke R. Best J. Cartlidge S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3579-3589Google Scholar). These SH2 domain structures identify the amino acids responsible for the pYXXM binding specificity. These amino acids, including the phenylalanine of the beta strand E and the leucines of the loop between the alpha helix B and the beta strand G, are conserved in p60. Together, these three amino acids, shown in Fig. 2 A, define the hydrophobic pocket that allows the specific binding of methionine three residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (26Zvelebil M.J. Panayotou G. Linacre J. Waterfield M.D. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 527-533Google Scholar).The inter-SH2 domain of mammalian p85α mediates binding to the Class IA PI3K, p110α. Modelling studies of this inter-SH2 domain predict a two- or four-helix antiparallel coiled-coil structure similar to the solved crystal structure of the inter-SH2 domain of ZAP-70 (16Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Google Scholar, 27Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 32-38Google Scholar). 3M. J. Zvelebil, personal communication The inter-SH2 domain of p60 is approximately 20% identical to the corresponding region of the mammalian adaptors. Despite this low homology, this region of p60 is likely to form a similar structure since it contains the leucine-rich heptad repeats characteristic of coiled-coil alpha helical bundles (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, BLITZ and BLASTP data base searches (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar, 29Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Google Scholar) show that this region of p60 is significantly homologous to coiled-coil regions of proteins that form stable heterodimers (data not shown).Genomic Location and Structure of the p60 GeneA BLASTN (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) data base search with the p60 nucleotide sequence identified a sequence tagged site (STS, Dm0574) from the Berkeley DrosophilaGenome Project that is identical to the 3′-untranslated region of the p60 cDNA and has been mapped to the genomic region, 21B6-C2 (30Hartl D.L. Nurminsky D.I. Jones R.W. Lozovskaya E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6824-6829Google Scholar). To further characterize the genomic structure of the p60 gene, we performed Southern analysis of a λ-phage contig of the region (kindly provided by M. Noll). This analysis determined the position and orientation of the p60 gene with respect to the publishedEcoRI restriction map (31Alcedo J. Ayzenzon M. Von Ohlen T. Noll M. Hooper J. Cell. 1996; 86: 221-232Google Scholar). Furthermore, the exon/intron structure of the gene was determined by PCR, subcloning, and sequence analysis of the genomic clones (Fig. 2 C). The gene encoding p60 has three exons and probably overlaps the breakpoint of the deficiency Df(2L)al at 21B8-C1.Expression of p60 at Different Stages of the Drosophila Life CycleWe initially purified p60 from S2 cells, an embryonically derived cell line. We next sought to characterize the expression of p60 at different stages of the Drosophila life cycle. The Dp110·p60 complex was affinity purified from Triton X-100 lysates of third instar larvae, pupae, and adult flies using pYXXM phosphopeptide beads (Fig. 3 A). The complex is present in all stages examined although we consistently recovered lower levels from larvae than from the other stages. Immunoblotting with antisera against N- and C-terminal sequences of p60 and against Dp110 confirmed the presence of these proteins (Fig. 3 B). An additional 55-kDa band can be seen that is immunoreactive with αp60N but not αp60C (Fig. 3, p60*). This protein might be a form of p60 that has been degraded from the C terminus, a splice variant of p60 lacking the C terminus or the product of another gene that cross-reacts with αp60N. We believe that this protein is a degraded form of p60 since its appearance coincides with lower levels of full-length p60 and because lysate preparation in the absence of certain protease inhibitors or following the freezing and thawing of samples resulted in increased levels of this smaller band (data not shown). In addition, the exon/intron structure of the p60 gene indicates that the 55-kDa band is unlikely to be encoded by an alternatively spliced transcript (Fig. 2 C).Figure 3Affinity purification of p60, Dp110, and PLCγ from S2 cells, third instar larvae (L3), pupae, and adult flies. Lysates contained approximately 80 mg of protein. The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and either silver stained (A) or transferred to nylon membranes and immunoblotted with αDp110, αp60N and αp60C (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Enzymatic Activity of the Dp110·p60 ComplexThe Dp110·p60 complex possesses lipid and protein kinase activity when affinity purified from S2 cells with phosphopeptide beads. We confirmed these results using immunoprecipitation as an independent method of purifying Dp110·p60. Silver staining and immunoblots show that both αp60N and αp60C can immunoprecipitate the Dp110·p60 complex though αp60C is more efficient than αp60N (data not shown). Dp110, whether immunoprecipitated or affinity purified, is able to autophosphorylate and, to a lesser degree, to transphosphorylate p60 (Fig.4 A). The autophosphorylation is comparable to that shown by human p110δ (44Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. 1997; Google Scholar), whereas the phosphorylation of p60 is reminiscent of the phosphorylation of p85α by mammalian p110α (32Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Google Scholar). However, p60 does not contain a phosphorylation site homologous to serine 608 in p85α (32Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with other Class IA PI3Ks in complex with their adaptors, both the immunoprecipitated Dp110·p60 complex and the affinity purified complex possessed lipid kinase activity as assessed by the conversion of phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (Fig.4 B).Figure 4The Dp110·p60 complex possesses protein and lipid kinase activity. Immunoprecipitation and phosphopeptide purification (using DPY, the PDGFβ receptor peptide doubly phosphorylated on tyrosines 740 and 751) were performed from equal volumes of S2 cell lysate with a 1:200 dilution of preimmune sera (αp60N and αp60C pooled), αp60N or αp60C. A, protein kinase assays were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed.B, lipid kinase assays were performed using phosphatidylinositol as a substrate, resolved by thin layer chromatography, and autoradiographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONp60 has been affinity purified from Drosophila with a pYXXM phosphopeptide previously used to purify mammalian adaptors for Class IA PI3Ks. Analysis of the p60 amino acid sequence and the lipid and protein kinase activity of the Dp110·p60 complex indicates that p60 is both structurally and functionally homologous to the mammalian adaptors for Class IA PI3Ks. Since p60 is the most divergent member of the family identified to date, its sequence provides an insight into the evolution of the structure and function of these molecules. Notably, the residues responsible for the SH2 domain binding specificity are conserved, and the prediction of a coiled-coil structure for the inter-SH2 domains of the adaptor subunits for Class IA PI3Ks is supported.Since we have shown that the pYXXM phosphopeptide can be used to purify adaptors in complex with Class IA PI3Ks from mammals and Drosophila, affinity purification with this phosphopeptide might also be used to isolate homologous PI3K complexes from many species. Interestingly, the SH2 domain of theDrosophila signaling molecule Drk also binds to the same phosphotyrosine motif recognized by its mammalian homologue Grb2 (33Raabe T. Olivier J.P. Dickson B. Liu X. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Hafen E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2509-2518Google Scholar), Thus, affinity purification with peptides containing specific phosphotyrosine motifs might be used to isolate SH2 domain-containing proteins from various organisms.Putative YXXM docking sites for the Dp110·p60 complex are found in the RTK Dret, the RTK substrate, Dos, and theDrosophila homologue of the insulin receptor, INR (34Sugaya R. Ishimaru S. Hosoya T. Saigo K. Emori Y. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 139-145Google Scholar, 35Raabe T. Riesgo-Escovar J. Liu X. Bausenwein B. Deak P. Maröy P. Hafen E.

However, it remains to be shown, either biochemically or genetically, whether these motifs are used in vivo. INR contains three YXXM motifs and is able to bind the N-terminal SH2 domain of mammalian p85α when phosphorylated (36Fernandez R. Tabarini D. Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3373-3384Google Scholar). Class IA PI3Ks associate with the mammalian insulin receptor via multiple pYXXM motifs in its substrate IRS-1 and are thought to mediate many of the effects of insulin stimulation (37Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Google Scholar). Consistent with an analogous role for Class IA PI3Ks downstream of theDrosophila INR, certain mutations in inr and the ectopic expression of dominant negative Dp110 both affect imaginal disc cell growth (19Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Google Scholar, 38Chen C. Jack J. Garofalo R. Endocrinology. 1996"
https://openalex.org/W1979153778,"Abstract A potentially important cross-talk characteristic of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor-induced intracellular calcium rise (Baffy, G., Sharma, K., Shi, W., Ziyadeh, F. N., and Williamson, J. R. (1995) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 210, 378–383) in murine mesangial cells. The present study examined the possible basis for this effect by evaluating the regulation of the type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) by TGF-β. TGF-β1 down-regulates IP3R protein expression by >90% with maximal and half-maximal effects after 8 and 2 h, respectively. TGF-β1 also decreased IP3R mRNA expression by 59% after 1 h. Phosphorylation of the IP3R was also demonstrated as early as 15 min after TGF-β1 exposure. Back phosphorylation assays of IP3R from TGF-β1-treated mesangial cells with protein kinase A (PKA), indicated that TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of the IP3R occurs at similar sites as for PKA. In vitro kinase assays using the known IP3R peptide substrates for PKA, RPSGRRESLTSFGNP and ARRDSVLAAS, demonstrated that TGF-β1 induces phosphorylation of both peptides (158 and 123% of control values, respectively). TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation was prevented by the addition of the PKA inhibitor peptide in the in vitro kinase assay. It is proposed that TGF-β-mediated effects on the IP3R may be an important characteristic of its ability to modulate the response of cells to factors that employ IP3R-mediated calcium release."
https://openalex.org/W2060112535,"We have previously shown that α2-adrenergic receptor-mediated coupling to phospholipase D (PLD) in vascular tissues requires a tyrosine kinase activity (Jinsi, A., Paradise, J., and Deth, R. C. (1996) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 302, 183–190). To further clarify this mode of regulation we reconstituted α2A/D-adrenergic receptor-stimulated PLD activity in PC12 cells expressing the cloned receptor. [3H]Myristic acid-labeled cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation, and aliquots of subnuclear fraction were utilized in the PLD assay. Agonist-stimulated PLD activity was measured in the presence of 0.4% butanol as [3H]phosphatidylbutanol formation. Both GTP and its non-hydrolyzable analog guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) stimulated PLD activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner that required co-activation of protein kinase C by phorbol dibutyrate. Addition of epinephrine produced a 3-fold stimulation of PLD activity in the presence of GTP and GDP. This agonist-stimulated PLD activity was completely blocked by the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist rauwolscine and by Clostridium botulinumtoxin as well as by antibodies directed against either pp60src, RhoA, or Ras GTPase-activating protein. These results indicate that coupling of the α2A/D-adrenergic receptor to PLD is complexly regulated by both the tyrosine kinase pp60src and the low molecular weight G protein RhoA."
https://openalex.org/W2096453600,"Cellular tRNALys-3 serves as the primer for reverse transcription of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1). tRNALys-3 interacts directly with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, is packaged into viral particles and anneals to the primer-binding site (PBS) of the HIV-1 genome to initiate reverse transcription. Therefore, the priming step of reverse transcription is a potential target for antiviral strategies. We have developed a mutant tRNALys-3 derivative with mutations in the PBS-binding region such that priming specificity was re-directed to the highly conserved TAR stem-loop region. This mutant tRNA retains high-affinity binding to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, viral encapsidation, and is able to prime at both the targeted TAR sequence and at the viral PBS. Constitutive expression of mutant tRNA in T-cells results in marked inhibition of HIV-1 replication, as determined by measurements of viral infectivity, syncytium formation, and p24 production. Inhibition of retroviral replication through interference with the normal process of priming constitutes a new anti-retroviral approach and also provides a novel tool for dissecting molecular aspects of priming.

Inhibition of retroviral replication through interference with the normal process of priming constitutes a new anti-retroviral approach and also provides a novel tool for dissecting molecular aspects of priming. Retroviruses contain two copies of an RNA genome which replicates via a DNA intermediate (1Weiss R. Weiss R. Teich N. Varmus H. Coffin J. RNA Tumor Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 209-260Google Scholar). Transcription of the RNA genome into the DNA intermediate is performed by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT). 1The abbreviations used are:RTreverse transcriptasePBSprimer-binding sitePCRpolymerase chain reactionLTRlong terminal repeatMoMuLVMoloney murine leukemia virus The primer for reverse transcription of the retroviral genome is a cellular transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNA is also crucial in several steps of the reverse transcription process subsequent to priming, such as the strand-transfer reactions. Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and their simian counterparts utilize tRNALys-3 as their primer (2Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Google Scholar, 3Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Google Scholar). HIV-1 virions appear to contain approximately eight tRNALys-3 molecules per two copies of viral genome (4Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q. Li Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Google Scholar). reverse transcriptase primer-binding site polymerase chain reaction long terminal repeat Moloney murine leukemia virus The reverse transcriptase protein of HIV-1 has been shown to directly bind the tRNALys-3 primer in vitro (5Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Gruninger-Leitch F. Barre-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Google Scholar, 6Wohrl B.M. Ehresmann B. Keith G. Le Grice S.F.J.

Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23867-23874Google Scholar). The interaction between tRNALys-3 and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is complex. At least four cellular tRNAs have been isolated from HIV-1 virions including tRNALys-3, tRNALys-1, tRNALys-2, and tRNAIlealthough tRNALys-3 is the predominant species isolated (3Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Google Scholar). Several interactions have been demonstrated in vitro between HIV-1 RT and tRNALys-3. Barat et al. (5Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Gruninger-Leitch F. Barre-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Google Scholar) have demonstrated specific contacts with the anticodon loop. Nuclease footprinting suggests partial protection of the so-called D-loop, TψC loop, and anticodon loops by RT (6Wohrl B.M. Ehresmann B. Keith G. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13617-13624Google Scholar). Mutations in the TψC loop, and particularly the D-loop of tRNALys-3 were found to significantly impair binding to HIV-1 RT in gel shift assays (8Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23867-23874Google Scholar). Consensus RNA motifs selectedin vitro by the SELEX procedure demonstrate that a consensus RNA pseudoknot with significant secondary and tertiary homology to the D-loop of tRNALys-3 is a preferred binding motif to RT (9Tuerk C. MacDougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Google Scholar). Additionally, RT facilitates annealing of the tRNALys-3 to the PBS sequence in vitro suggesting RT also plays a role in unwinding of the tRNALys-3 acceptor stem (8Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23867-23874Google Scholar). Finally, while RT-deficient virions contain a viral genome, the tRNALys-3 primer is not packaged, indicating that tRNALys-3 packaging is dependent upon the presence of RT (8Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23867-23874Google Scholar). In addition to the primary tRNA-RT interaction required for packaging, RT also recognizes preformed tRNA-HIV-1 template complexesin vitro suggesting a second level of interaction likely to be important in initiation of cDNA synthesis (8Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23867-23874Google Scholar). Selective incorporation of tRNALys-3 is thought to be mediated by the Pr160gag-pol precursor. Precursor processing is not required for selective incorporation (3Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Google Scholar). Incorporation is also not dependent on the primer-binding site. Interactions have been described between the p66 as well as the p51 subunits of RT and the 5′ end of tRNA by platinum cross-linking (10Zakharova O.D. Tarrago-Litvak L. Maksakova G. Andreola M.L. Dufour E. Litvak S. Nevinsky G.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 856-863Google Scholar). Preincubation of heterodimeric RT (p66/p51) was noted to increase catalytic activity on a poly(A)-oligo(dT) template (11Zakharova O.D. Tarrago-Litvak L. Fournier M. Andreola M.L. Repkova M.N. Venyaminova A.G. Litvak S. Nevinsky G.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 287-290Google Scholar) suggesting that tRNA binding may also lead to “activation” of the p66/p51 heterodimer. Nuclease footprinting of HIV-1 RT-tRNALys-3complexes demonstrated protection of bases within the anticodon and D-loops, and potential TψC-D-loop interactions which are disrupted in the presence of HIV-1 RT (6Wohrl B.M. Ehresmann B. Keith G. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13617-13624Google Scholar). Other investigators, using pancreatic RNase A footprinting, showed protection of both the tRNALys-3 anticodon loop and D-loop but not the acceptor stem, confirming a strong HIV-1 RT interaction with several regions of tRNA (7Sarih-Cottin L. Bordier B. Musier-Forsyth K. Andreola M.L. Barr P.J. Litvak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1-6Google Scholar). In addition to interaction between the tRNA primer and HIV-1 RT, other interactions involving the tRNA primer include annealing of the 3′-terminal 18 base pairs of tRNALys-3 homologous to the HIV-1 PBS and annealing of various loops of tRNALys-3 to regions of the HIV-1 genome outside the PBS (12Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Google Scholar, 13Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol.

A. 1992; 89: 9652-9656Google Scholar). HIV-1 particles containing viral RNA sequences lacking the PBS continue to preferentially package tRNALys-3, suggesting that PBS-tRNA annealing alone does not determine the packaging preference for the tRNALys-3 primer (3Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Google Scholar). Anti-retroviral strategies which make use of the unique properties of tRNAs have recently been proposed. Rossi and co-workers (19Westaway S.K. Larson G.P. Li S. Zaia J.A. Rossi J.J. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; 33: 194-199Google Scholar) described a chimeric tRNA in which anti-HIV-1 ribozyme was fused to tRNALys-3. Because this chimeric RNA contained tRNALys-3 coding sequences, it was expressed at high levels via RNA polymerase III. In addition, this ribozyme/tRNA hybrid was specifically targeted to HIV-1 virions based on the affinity of tRNALys-3 for RT. Another study described a chimeric tRNA in which an anti-HIV-1 antisense RNA was linked to tRNAPro(20Biasolo M.A. Radaelli A. Del Pup L. Franchin E. De Giuli-Morghen C. Palu G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2154-2161Google Scholar). In that case, the presence of tRNAPro sequences increased stability of the chimeric RNA in the intracellular environment (20Biasolo M.A. Radaelli A. Del Pup L. Franchin E. De Giuli-Morghen C. Palu G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2154-2161Google Scholar). We have developed a strategy for inhibition of the HIV-1 replication cycle via interference with priming of reverse transcription. To accomplish this, we designed a tRNALys-3-derived mutant tRNA with a modified acceptor stem. This mutant tRNA, designated tRNAtarD, was shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication when expressed in human CD4 lymphocytes. The results presented here, together with available published information, indicate that potent inhibition of retroviral replication can be achieved by targeting priming of reverse transcription. Inhibition of retroviral replication through interference with the normal process of priming constitutes a novel anti-retroviral approach and also provides a powerful tool for dissecting molecular aspects of priming. The tRNALys-3-UUU gene (21Roy K.L. Cooke H. Buckland R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7313-7322Google Scholar) with 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences was obtained by amplification of DNA extracted from HeLa cells using the primers: 5′- TCGCCGAGATAAGCTTCAGCCTCTACTATGGTACAG-3′ and 5′-ATAATAGCACAAGCTTTATTACCCTCCACCGTCGTT-3′ and Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR fragment was then digested with HindIII and cloned into theHindIII site of pBluescript-KS vector, to yield pM13Lys-3. The tRNAtarD gene, including 20 nucleotides upstream and 130 nucleotides downstream flanking the human tRNALys-3-UUU gene, was obtained by PCR amplification using two primer pairs: 1L, 5′-GTAAAGCTCTCGTGAAGATAGACCATAGCTCAGTCGGTAGAGC-3′ and 1R, 5′-CCAAAAGCAAAGACATGCCGCTTAGACCACAGGGACTTGAACCCTGGAC-3′; and 2L, 5′-GTCCAGGGTTCAAGTCCCTGTGGTCTAAGCGGCATGTCTTTGCTTTTGG-3′ and 2R, 5′-ATAATAGCACAAGCTTTATTACCCTCCACCGTCGTT-3′. The first amplification was done using the pM13Lys-3 DNA template and primers 1L and 1R, resulting in fragment A. A second amplification was carried out using pM13Lys-3 and primers 2L and 2R, giving rise to fragment B. Both A and B fragments were then agarose-gel purified. A third PCR reaction was performed using a mixture of purified A and B fragments as templates. Primers 1L and 2R were used to generate a tRNAtarD sequence containing 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences required for correct transcription and processing by polymerase III. The final PCR fragment was cloned into the bluntedXhoI site of pAC7, an AAV-derived vector (22Lebkowski J.S. McNally T.B. Okarma T.B. Lerch B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3988-3996Google Scholar), resulting in pACtarD. The sequence was then verified. tRNAtarD coding sequences were excised from pACtarD by HindIII and NcoI digestion. After complete filling of the ends formed byHindIII and NcoI, the fragment was subcloned into the SnaBI site of the vector pN2A (23Sullenger B.A. Lee T.C. Smith C.A. Ungers G.E. Gilboa E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 12: 6512-6513Google Scholar), resulting in the retroviral vector pN2A-tarD (Fig. 1C), and sequence and orientation were confirmed by sequencing. The vectors pUClys and pUCtarD contain coding sequences for both tRNALys-3 and tRNAtarD downstream of the T7 promoter and were used for in vitro transcription. Coding sequences for tRNALys-3 were synthesized by annealing and extending two oligonucleotides: left primer 5′-AATTGCTGCAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGCCCGGATAGCTCAGTCGGTAGAGCATCAGACTTTTAATCTGAGGGTCCAGGGTTCAAG-3′; and right primer 5′-CTAAGCTGCAGATGCATGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACTTGAACCCTGGACCCT-3′ at 70 °C for 15 min followed by 37 °C for 30 min in 1 × PCR buffer using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with PstI and cloned into the PstI site of pUC120 to yield pUClys. The tRNAtarD sequences were generated by amplification of pUClys using the primer pair: left 5′-AATTGCTGCAGTAATACGACTCACTATATAGACCATAGCTCAGTCGGTAGAGCA and right 5′-CTAAGCTGCAGATGCATGGTTAGACCACAGGGACTTGAACCCTGGACCCT. The resultant PCR fragment was then cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 to yield pUCtarD. The vector pSP-PBS was constructed by subcloning a 0.9-kilobase pair,ScaI to NsiI fragment from the HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 (24Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T., R., W. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Google Scholar), into the bacterial vector, pSP-73 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), previously digested with PvuII andNsiI. The restriction fragment from pNL4-3 includes nucleotides −133 to +386 of the flanking sequences and 5′-LTR region of HIV-1-NL4-3 (24Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T., R., W. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Google Scholar). pUClys and pUCtarD were linearized byNsiI digestion to generate a 3′ CCA end, and transcribed by T7 polymerase using reagents and conditions supplied with the Promega T7 transcription kit in the presence of 10 μCi of [32P]CTP. Radiolabeled RNAs were gel purified according to the method described previously (25Oommen A. Li X.Q. Gegenheimer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 75-865Google Scholar). Competition analysis was performed by standard methods (26Jacques P.S. Wohrl B.M. Howard K.J. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1388-1393Google Scholar). The GP+E-86 ecotropic packaging cell line was a generous gift from A. Bank (Columbia University, New York). The PA317 amphotropic packaging cell line and NIH3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The T-cell line MT-2 was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program of the National Institutes of Health (Rockville, MD). The vector pN2A-tarD was transfected into the ecotropic packaging cell line GP+E-86 using lipofection (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Virus-containing supernatant from the GP+E-86 cells was collected and used to transduce PA317 amphotropic packaging cells, and the cells selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418. High-titer clones were identified by measuring the transfer of G418 resistance using serially diluted supernatant to NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and supernatant from these clones was used to transduce MT-2 cells and CEM cells (ATCC). The control vector, pLN, a MoMuLV-based retroviral vector containing the neomycin resistance gene expressed from the MoMuLV-LTR, was constructed and packaged in the laboratory of A. Dusty Miller (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). To transduce MT-2 cells, LN and N2A-tarD vector-producing PA317 cells were irradiated at 40 gray and plated at 2 × 106cells/100-cm2 plate 24 h before the addition of 1 × 106 MT-2 cells. Co-cultivation was carried out in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 48 h. Non-adherent MT-2 cells were collected, and a second round of co-cultivation over irradiated vector-producing fibroblasts was performed. Transduced MT-2 cells were selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418, and subcloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates, to yield MT2/LN (transduced with LN) and MT2/TARD (transduced with N2A-tarD) clones. Total RNA was extracted from parental MT2 and MT2/TARD cells using the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol-chloroform method (27Chromczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out using MoMuLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommendations for first strand synthesis, using 100 ng of the antisense primers described below. One μl of reverse transcribed cDNA was amplified using 1 μl of RT reaction product as template. Each PCR reaction was conducted in a final volume of 50 μl containing 1.25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase and a total of 300 ng of tRNAtarD-specific primers (sense, 5′-TAGACCATAGCTCAGTCGGT-3′; and antisense, 5′-TGGTTAGACCACAGGGACTT-3′) or 300 ng of tRNALys-3 specific primers (sense, 5′-GCCCGGATAGCTCAGTCGGT-3′; and antisense, 5′-TGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACTT-3′). Thermocycling temperatures used were: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, annealing at 60 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by cycling at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for a total of 30 cycles. 10 μl of the amplified PCR product was subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. Parental MT-2, MT2/LN cells which were transfected with retroviral vector alone (no tRNAtarD expression), and MT2/TARD were compared for ability to support HIV-1 replication. Cells were routinely grown in Iscove's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 × of Penn/Strep at 37 °C. The virus strain used in this study was HIV-IIIB, which was prepared and titered in MT-2 cells. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells/well. HIV-IIIB virus stock was serially diluted 10-fold in Iscove's medium containing no fetal bovine serum. Using 4–6 wells per dilution for each cell line, 0.1 ml/well of each virus dilution was inoculated. Control wells received the same amount of medium. Infected cultures were examined daily for syncytia formation and viral titers determined at days 5 and 10 postinfection according to the method described by Reed and Muench (28Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1983; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). For each infection, a total of 1 × 104 cells (MT-2, MT2/TARD, or MT2/LN) in exponential growth phase were harvested, washed once with medium, and pelleted. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of diluted HIV-IIIB stock containing 10 TCID50 units of virus. After adsorption at 37 °C for 2 h, 10 ml of medium was added, and the cells pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 15 ml of Iscove's and 10% fetal calf serum medium, and transferred into a 25-cm2flask. Duplicate infections per cell line were employed in each challenge assay, and the infected cultures were incubated at 37 °C. Every other day beginning from day 2 postinfection, 0.5 ml of culture supernatant was removed from the flasks, and virus replication was monitored by measuring the production of p24 viral antigen in culture supernatant using an HIV-1 p24 antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL). Template RNAs comprising HIV-1 genome sequences for RNA-dependent DNA polymerase assays in vitro were generated by in vitro transcription from the plasmid clone, pSP-PBS (see “Vector Construction” above). Template RNA 1, 545 nucleotides long, was generated by transcription in vitro of an XmnI restriction fragment pSP-PBS using T7 RNA polymerase. Template RNA 1 encompassed nucleotides −133 to +386 of the flanking sequences and 5′-LTR region of pNL4-3 (24Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T., R., W. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Google Scholar). In addition, its 5′ end contained 26 nucleotides from the multiple cloning site of pSP-73. Template RNA 2 was generated following restriction digestion of the plasmid pSP-PBS with HindIII followed by transcription in vitrousing T7 RNA polymerase. Template RNA 2 contained the region of the genomic RNA from −133 to +81, 240 nucleotides in length. This sequence does not include the PBS. DNA primers 1, 2, and 3 were complementary to regions of the template RNAs corresponding to HIV-1 genomic positions +191 to +209, +59 to +78, and +22 to +41, respectively. Conditions for annealing to and DNA polymerization from RNA templates with various primers were as described previously (29Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4861-4869Google Scholar). The RNA template and the respective primers were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 80 mm KCl with a 10:1 molar ratio of primer to template. Similarly, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase assays were carried out as before with slight modifications (29Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4861-4869Google Scholar). Final reaction mixtures contained 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mmEDTA, 34 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 nm substrate, 50 mm unlabeled dNTPs, and 4 units of recombinant purified HIV-1 RT. Recombinant HIV-1 RT was graciously provided to us by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). This RT has native heterodimeric structure, is free of detectable nuclease and polymerase contaminants, and has a specific activity of 40,000 units/mg (29Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4861-4869Google Scholar). The RT was preincubated with the substrate for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and dNTPs, incubated for 15 min and terminated with 25 ml of termination mixture (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mmEDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue). For some experiments, DNA synthesis was performed in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. When radiolabeled tRNA primers were employed, unlabeled dNTPs were used in the synthesis reaction. Reaction products were resolved on 6% urea polyacrylamide denaturing gels followed by autoradiography. Cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 30 min). Recovered supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-mm filter, and virus present in the filtrate was concentrated and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation prior to isolation of viral RNA. HIV-1-IIIB produced from MT2/LN cells was similarly prepared for control analysis. Total viral RNA was extracted from purified viral pellets using the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol chloroform method (27Chromczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNA concentration was determined by A260, and RNA integrity was verified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Analysis of viral RNAs for mutant tRNAtarD was conducted by RT-PCR (see above). For each RT-PCR reaction, 0.2 μg of viral RNA was amplified by the tRNAtarD-specific primers, and amplified products were subjected to gel electrophoresis. Amplification of the viral RNAs with tRNALys-3-specific primers was performed as a control. Infected cell DNA was extracted by the urea lysis method (30Zack J.A. Arrigo S.J. Weitsman S.R. Go A.S. Haislip A. Chen I.S.Y. Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Google Scholar), phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in TE buffer to a final concentration of 1.4 μg/μl. Target cell DNA was diluted to contain 1 copy of proviral DNA per μl, and 1 μl of this dilution was amplified 11 independent times with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR products thus obtained were purified on ion exchange mini-columns (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and sequenced in the sense and antisense directions (AmpliTaq, Perkin-Elmer). Primers for amplification and sequencing were as follows: sense: 5′-GGTCTCTCTGGTTAGACCAG-3′ and antisense: 5′-CGTCGAGAGATCTCCTCTG-3′. Amplification conditions were 28 cycles, where each cycle consisted of the following steps: 94 °C for 1 min followed by 55 °C for 1 min followed by 72 °C for 30 s. We wished to synthesize a mutant tRNA in which recognition of the PBS would be redirected to a region of the viral genome different from PBS. We constructed a gene encoding a tRNALys-3-derived mutant in which 3′ primer-binding sequences in the acceptor stem were modified to be complementary to the highly conserved TAR stem-loop region of HIV-1. This mutant was designated tRNAtarD (Fig. 1, panel A). This modification was introduced with the purpose of triggering aberrant priming of reverse transcription at a site upstream from the natural PBS. We chose the TAR stem-loop sequence as a target for this aberrant priming by mutant tRNA because it is a conserved sequence and is important in the reverse transcription process itself (31Harrich D. Ulich C. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4017-4027Google Scholar). Priming of reverse transcriptase at the TAR site would be predicted to interfere with the retroviral life cycle by causing premature priming upstream of the PBS. We substituted seven nucleotides of the 3′ sequence of tRNALys-3 to produce a sequence complementary to the conserved TAR region of HIV-1, and made six additional substitutions in 5′ sequences complementary to the 3′ mutations to restore the tRNA secondary structure (Fig. 1, panel A), in the acceptor stem such that the mutant tRNA would retain predicted secondary and tertiary tRNA structure and ability to bind RT (32Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2523-2532Google Scholar, 33Behlen L.S. Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2515-2523Google Scholar). Care was taken not to modify other regions of the tRNA which are important for polymerase III transcription such as “A” and “B” boxes (34Geiduschek E.P. Valentini G.P. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 873-914Google Scholar), for stability, and for interaction with HIV-1 RT (5Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Gruninger-Leitch F. Barre-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23867-23874Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT has been reported to specifically recognize the tRNALys-3 anticodon region (5Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Gruninger-Leitch F. Barre-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Google Scholar, 35Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol.

Mutant tRNAtarD retains wild-type anticodon stem-loop sequences (Fig. 1). To determine whether substitutions within either the 3′ primer binding sequences or the structure of the acceptor stem of tRNA would affect the affinity of RT for mutant tRNAtarD, the previous tRNA and wild-type tRNALys-3 were transcribedin vitro and assayed for binding by gel retardation assay in the presence of cold competitor tRNAs (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, binding of tRNAtarD to HIV-1 RT could be effectively competed by increasing molar concentrations of tRNALys-3(lanes 1–6). Conversely, binding of tRNALys-3to HIV-1 RT could be effectively competed by increasing molar concentrations of tRNAtarD (lanes 9–14). The degree of competition that tRNAtarD and tRNALys-3 exert on each other is identical and therefore, we conclude that tRNAtarD binds to purified HIV-1 RT with similar affinity to that of tRNALys-3 in our assays. Additional gel-shift experiments showed that tRNAtarD bound efficiently to HIV-1 RT, but not to MoMuLV RT (data not shown). The ability of tRNALys-3-derived mutant tRNAtarD to bind RT is likely retained due to the preserved anticodon region of tRNA, which is important in recognition by HIV-1 RT (36Barat C. Schatz O. Le Grice S. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 185-190Google Scholar). We transduced the MT-2 T-cell line with the retroviral vector, N2A-tarD (Fig. 1, panel B) containing tRNAtarD coding sequences. Assays for polymerase III-directed transcriptionin vitro using Jurkat-derived T-cell extracts, and the N2A-tarD vector coding sequences, resulted in transcription and correct processing of tRNAtarD (data not shown). Following G418 selection of transduced cells, DNA and RNA were extracted from bulk G418-selected cloned cell lines, and mutant tRNA sequences were detected us"

(1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 20781–20786). To investigate the possible role of α- and ε-amino groups of γB-crystallin in glycation-mediated cross-linking, Lys-2 or Lys-163, or both, were mutated to threonine by site-directed mutagenesis in bovine γB-crystallin cDNA. Wild type and mutant γB-crystallins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Cross-linking studies were performed by incubating wild type and mutant γB-crystallins with glyceraldehyde, ribose, and galactose followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. When both of the lysines of γB-crystallin were mutated to threonines (γB-K2T/K163T), the quantity of cross-linked products was greatly reduced, indicating that, despite the fact that the α-amino group is a major glycated site, ε-amino groups play a predominant role in cross-linking. Therefore, cross-linking ability depends not only upon the level of glycation but also upon which amino group is glycated. Steric hindrance may decrease the cross-linking ability of the α-amino group. Our results also show that Lys-2 and Lys-163 play almost equal roles in cross-linking of γB-crystallin. By incubating carbonic anhydrase, a protein with a blocked N terminus, and our novel “no lysine” γB (γB-K2T/K163T) with sugar, we were able to show for the first time that significant cross-linking occurs between lysines and non-lysine sites. The fact that pentosidine and imidazolysine, formed from ribose and methylglyoxal, respectively, were present in the cross-linked γB-crystallins revealed the existence of Lys-Arg and Lys-Lys cross-linking. In the previous report we demonstrated that γB-crystallin is glycated predominantly at the N-terminal α-amino group (Casey, E. B., Zhao, H. R., and Abraham, E. C. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 20781–20786).

Aldehyde or keto groups of reducing sugars react mainly with α- and ε-amino groups on proteins forming unstable Schiff base adducts, which rearrange to form more stable Amadori products (1Monnier V.M. Baynes J.W. Monnier V.M. The Maillard Reaction in Aging, Diabetes, and Nutrition. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 1-22Google Scholar). These Amadori products undergo a series of chemical reactions, becoming brown, fluorescent, and irreversibly cross-linked products. Vlassara et al. (2Vlassara H. Brownlee M. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) first used the term advanced glycosylation (glycation) end products (AGEs) 1The abbreviations used areAGEadvanced glycation end product;CAcarbonic anhydrase;HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography;PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. to describe these cross-linked products formed during the late stage of the Maillard reaction in vivo. AGE-mediated cross-linking is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of aging and in the complications of diabetes (3Brownlee M. Cerami A. Vlassara H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar, 4Brownlee M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 5Vlassara H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 124: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of proteins is believed to occur mostly among ε-amino groups of lysines as well as guanidinium groups of arginines. But the roles of these groups and of α-amino groups in glycation-mediated cross-linking are still not clear because AGE structure is largely unknown. At present, AGEs are thought to be composed of diverse structures. However, studies with recently developed monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against AGEs have suggested that they all have a common structure (6Horiuchi S. Araki N. Morino Y. J. Biol.

Among them, pentosidine (Lys-Arg), crosslines (Lys-Lys), and imidazolysine (Lys-Lys) have cross-linking properties. advanced glycation end product; carbonic anhydrase; high performance liquid chromatography; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. γ-Crystallin is one of the major classes of lens-soluble proteins. Bovine γB-crystallin, the major species of bovine γ-crystallin, contains only two lysines (Lys-2 and Lys-163) among its 174 amino acid residues (15Hay R.E. Woods W.D. Church R.L. Petrash J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). γ-Crystallin is the only crystallin with a free N terminus (16Mok C.C. Waley S.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1968; 7: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is synthesized at an early stage in the development of the lens and is found mainly at the core region of the mammalian lens (17Papaconstantinou J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 107: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since there is little or no protein turnover in the core region (18Wannemacher C.F. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1968; 7: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), postsynthetic modifications of γB-crystallin such as glycation will accumulate in the nucleus of the lens. Indeed, it is the core region where nuclear cataract, the important form of cataract with protein cross-linking and brunescense in humans, is formed. In a previous report, we showed that the N-terminal α-amino group of bovine γB-crystallin is the predominant glycation site (19Casey E.B. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20781-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), as confirmed recently by mass spectrometry analysis (20Smith J.B. Hanson S.R.A. Cerny R.L. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the present communication, the two lysines of bovine γB-crystallin were mutated to threonine; this “no lysine” γB-crystallin, as well as the mutants containing only Lys-2 or Lys-163, was used to study the role of the N-terminal α-amino group of Gly-1 and the ε-amino groups of two lysines in glycation-mediated cross-linking of γB-crystallin. The bovine γB-crystallin cDNA in pBluescript (15Hay R.E. Woods W.D. Church R.L. Petrash J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Regine Hay (Department of Ophthalmology, Washington University). γB-crystallin cDNA was subcloned into the Nco I/Hin dIII cloning site of expression vector pMON5743 (pMONγB), and site-directed mutagenesis of Lys-2 to Thr (pMONγB-K2T) was carried out using polymerase chain reaction as described previously (19Casey E.B. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20781-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Creation of two new mutants, Lys-163 to Thr (K163T) as well as Lys-2 and Lys-163 to Thr (K2T/K163T), was accomplished with synthetic oligonucleotides. The desired base changes of Lys-163 to Thr were incorporated into the oligonucleotides (AACCAACTGTGGCATTC and AATGCCACAGTTGGTTC), and mutagenesis was performed by two-stage polymerase chain reaction-based overlap extension (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Morton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Using pMONγB as a template led to the generation of a γB-K163T mutant, whereas when pMONγB-K2T was used as the template, the double mutant γB-K2T/K163T was generated. The nucleotide sequences were checked using the sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Other methods used in subcloning were described previously (19Casey E.B. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20781-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Clones containing pMONγB, pMONγB-K2T, pMONγB-K163T, and pMONγB-K2T/K163T were used to express recombinant γB-crystallins of wild type, mutant K2T (γB-K2T), mutant K163T (γB-K163T), and mutant K2T/K163T (γB-K2T/K163T), respectively. Expression of wild type and mutant γB-crystallins was performed according to the method of Olins and Rangwala (22Olins P.O. Rangwala S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant γB-crystallins in the cell lysates were purified using cation-exchange HPLC according to the method of Siezen et al. (23Siezen R.J. Kaplan E.D. Anello R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (19Casey E.B. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20781-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since γB-K2T/K163T has a lower pI, buffers used in cation-exchange HPLC were adjusted to pH 5.5 instead of pH 6.0, and bacterial proteins found in the γB-K2T/K163T fraction were removed by molecular sieve chromatography on a 2 × 100-cm Sephadex G-100 (Sigma) column. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using a 12% separating gel and a 4% stacking gel under reducing conditions. Gels were routinely stained with Coomassie Blue, but in the case of galactose incubation a silver stain kit (Bio-Rad) was used to visualize small amounts of cross-linked products. Western blotting was carried out using a monoclonal antibody against rat γ-crystallin (19Casey E.B. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20781-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Swamy M.S. Shyamala M. Abraham A. Garver F.A. Abraham E.C. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 9: 833-842Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Bovine γ-crystallin was prepared as described previously (19Casey E.B. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20781-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fifty microliters of wild type or mutant γB-crystallin (2 mg/ml) were incubated with or without sugar in darkness at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% sodium azide. Since the cross-linking ability of different sugars varies (26Swamy M.S. Tsai C. Abraham A. Abraham E.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), different sugar concentrations were used: glyceraldehyde (5 mm), ribose (100 mm), and galactose (1m) (all from Sigma). To investigate the ability of lysine to cross-link with non-lysine sites (e.g. α-amino group as well as arginine and histidine residues), equal concentrations of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and γB-K2T/K163T or wild type γB were incubated with 5 mm glyceraldehyde. After incubation for 10 days (glyceraldehyde and ribose) or 20 days (galactose), the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the gels were scanned on a CS-9301 PC dual wavelength Fly Spot scanning densitometer (Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pentosidine (Lys-Arg cross-link) was synthesized according to the method of Sell and Monnier (9Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Imidazolysine (Lys-Lys cross-link) was synthesized as described previously (14Nagaraj R.H. Shipanova I.N. Faust F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19338-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant γB-crystallin (2 mg/ml) were incubated with either 25 mm d-ribose (for pentosidine) or methylglyoxal (for imidazolysine) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C. Aliquots of 0.3 ml were withdrawn on days 0, 5, and 10. Proteins incubated simultaneously without the added carbohydrate served as controls. After incubation, the protein was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 20 h. The acid was evaporated in a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY), and the amino acids were reconstituted in water followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for clarification. Pentosidine was estimated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac, 218TP, 25 × 0.46 cm, 10 μm, Separations Group, Hesperia, CA). The mobile phase consisted of water (A) and 60% acetonitrile in water (B) with 0.01m heptafluorobutyric acid (Sigma). The gradient program used was 16–28% B in 35 min. The effluent from the column was monitored for fluorescence at 385 nm (excitation, 335 nm). Pentosidine eluted at ∼29.0 min. For quantification, the peak area in the samples was compared with the peak area of a known amount of purified pentosidine. Other details of the HPLC settings are described elsewhere (28Nagaraj R.H. Kern T.S. Sell D.R. Fogarty J.F. Engerman R.L. Monnier V.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Imidazolysine was estimated by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac, 201HS54, 25 × 0.46 cm, 5 μm). The mobile phase consisted of water (A) and 70% methanol in water (B) with 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid. The gradient program was 0–100% B in 35 min. The column effluent was allowed to mix with o-phthalaldehyde for postcolumn derivatization, and the fluorescent derivatives were detected by an on-line fluorescence detector (Jasco International Co. Ltd., Toyko, Japan) set at excitation/emission of 340/455 nm as described by Nagaraj et al. (14Nagaraj R.H. Shipanova I.N. Faust F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19338-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Under these conditions imidazolysine eluted at ∼22 min. For quantification, the peak area in the samples was compared with the peak area of a known amount of purified imidazolysine. Wild type and mutant γB-crystallins were expressed in JM101 Escherichia coli cells. The supernatants of cell lysates were concentrated and analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE. Heavy bands with molecular mass equal to calf γ-crystallin were found in all cell lysates except in the lysate of the cells containing the vector pMON5743 without γB-crystallin cDNA (Fig.1 A). The recombinant proteins were purified, and the purity of the proteins was checked on SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 B). Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody to rat γ-crystallin (19Casey E.B. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20781-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Swamy M.S. Shyamala M. Abraham A. Garver F.A. Abraham E.C. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 9: 833-842Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) confirmed the expression of γB-crystallin (Fig. 1 B). To cross-link γB-crystallins in a realistic in vitro time span, purified wild type and mutant γB-crystallins were reacted with different concentrations of sugars that are known to glycate and cross-link much faster than glucose and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After a 10-day incubation with dl-glyceraldehyde, dimer (∼40 kDa), trimer (∼60 kDa), and higher molecular mass cross-linked products were seen in wild type γB (Fig. 2 A). Fewer cross-linked products were found in γB-K2T and γB-K163T, but heavy dimer bands could still be seen in both the mutants. If γB-K2T and γB-K163T are compared, the former seems to have slightly less cross-linked protein than the latter. Only a faint band of cross-linked product was observed with the double mutant γB-K2T/K163T despite the fact that the α-amino group of Gly-1 is the predominant glycation site of γB-crystallin. Gel scanning showed that formation of the dimer of γB-K2T/K163T decreased by 73% as compared with that of wild type γB. When other slower reacting sugars, such as ribose and galactose, were incubated with wild type and mutant γB-crystallins, similar results were obtained (Fig. 2, B and C), but no significant difference in cross-linking was seen among the wild type γB, γB-K2T, and γB-K163T, and no trimer or higher cross-linking product was observed. Again, only faint cross-linked dimer bands were found in the incubation of γB-K2T/K163T, which confirmed that ε-amino groups of lysine are important in glycation-mediated cross-linking. To investigate possible cross-linking between ε-amino groups and non-lysine cross-linking sites (e.g. α-amino group as well as arginine and histidine residues), CA was incubated with γB-K2T/K163T or wild type γB in the presence of 5 mmglyceraldehyde for 10 days. CA was chosen because it has a blocked N terminus, 18 lysines (29Croft L.R. Handbook of Protein Sequence Analysis. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1980: 175-179Google Scholar), and a molecular mass of about 29 kDa, which facilitates distinguishing the different cross-linked dimers,e.g. γB-K2T/K163T-γB-K2T/K163T, γB-K2T/K163T-CA, and CA-CA, on SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 shows that there are substantial cross-linked products consisting of γB-K2T/K163T and CA (lane 2), and the quantity of the cross-linked product is much higher than that made up of two γB-K2T/K163T mutants (lane 5) but less than that comprised of wild type γB-crystallin and CA (lane 3). To confirm the existence of Lys-Arg and Lys-Lys cross-linking, pentosidine and imidazolysine were analyzed after cross-linking recombinant γB with sugars (Fig. 4). Our data show that pentosidine and imidazolysine do exist in the cross-linking of γB-crystallin and the amounts of pentosidine and imidazolysine decrease along with the decrease of lysine content of γB. Fig. 4 also shows that approximately the same amount of pentosidine or imidazolysine was found from γB-K2T and K163T. This finding agrees with our cross-linking data, which show that γB-K2T and γB-K163T incubations contain about the same quantities of cross-linking products (Fig. 2 A). Some pentosidine and imidazolysine detected in γB-K2T/K163T could have come from a small amount of bacterial protein contamination. Since γB-crystallin is a low lysine content protein, small amounts of high lysine content bacterial proteins may cause significant increases of pentosidine and imidazolysine even though the cross-linking of bacterial proteins cannot be seen on the SDS-PAGE of the protein cross-linking (Fig. 2). Determination of the roles that specific glycated amino acid residues play in cross-linking and insolubilization of crystallins will shed light on the mechanism by which diabetic and senile cataracts form. From our results, it is clear that lysine, although only weakly glycated, is important for glycation-mediated cross-linking, and the α-amino group of γB-crystallin, despite being a major glycation site (19Casey E.B. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20781-20786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Smith J.B. Hanson S.R.A. Cerny R.L. Zhao H.R. Abraham E.C. Anal.

Acta. 1994; 1226: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), has much less ability to cross-link with itself or with other residues. Therefore, cross-linking ability depends not only upon the level of glycation but also upon which amino group is glycated. Furthermore, by using our novel “no lysine” γB-crystallin (γB-K2T/K163T) and another protein having no free N terminus, we were able to show for the first time that significant cross-linking between lysine and non-lysine cross-linking sites exists (Fig. 3). Noticeable loss of arginine and lysine after incubating lysozyme with glucose suggests that lysine and arginine are important candidates for cross-linking (31Okitani A. Cho R.W. Kato H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 1801-1808Google Scholar). Earlier studies (9Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that lysine and arginine can be cross-linked by a pentose to form a Lys-Arg cross-link, namely pentosidine. Pentose could be formed from hexose through sugar fragmentation or from triose, tetrose, and ketose by condensation and/or reverse aldose reactions (32Sell D.R. Nagaraj R.H. Grandhee S.K. Odetti P. Lapolla A. Fogarty J. Monnier V.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1991; 7: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently, Nagarajet al. (14Nagaraj R.H. Shipanova I.N. Faust F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19338-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) showed that a three-carbon metabolite, methylglyoxal, which increases in diabetic lenses, reacts with lysines of proteins forming a Lys-Lys cross-link, namely imidazolysine. Thus, pentosidine and imidazolysine were analyzed in cross-linked γB-crystallin. The fact that pentosidine and imidazolysine are present in the cross-linking of γB-crystallin reveals the existence of Lys-Arg and Lys-Lys cross-linking. The high levels of imidazolysine (5–9 nmol/23 nmol of lysine) may have resulted from the possible lysine-rich protein contamination on crystallin preparation. Experiments with ultrapure preparations of proteins may shed light on this issue. According to Prabhakaram and Ortwerth (33Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), [14C]lysine was more readily incorporated into lysozyme than [14C]leucine during glycation-mediated cross-linking studies. This finding was interpreted as evidence for cross-linking principally at the ε-amino group rather than at the α-amino group. This hypothesis was confirmed by our protein-protein cross-linking model. Okitani et al. (31Okitani A. Cho R.W. Kato H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 1801-1808Google Scholar) show that acetylation of free amino groups of lysozyme before incubation with glucose prevents cross-linking of the protein and loss of lysine and arginine. This finding strengthens the importance of the amino group in cross-linking. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to differentiate between the roles of α- and ε-amino groups and show that the ε-amino group is more important than the α-amino group in cross-linking. The present study shows for the first time that an engineered “no lysine” protein is useful in assessing the role of α- and ε-amino groups in glycation-mediated cross-linking. The advantage of site-directed mutagenesis over the chemical modification is that the roles of individual amino groups of proteins in cross-linking can be ascertained. The reason the readily glycated α-amino group has a weaker ability to cross-link with itself or other non-lysine sites than lysine is not clear. The N-terminal α-amino group is, in fact, on the surface of γB-crystallin (34Blundell T.L. Lindley P.F. Miller L. Moss D.S. Slingsby C. Tickle I.J. Turnell W.G. Wistow G.J. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and is thus accessible to other cross-linking sites. One possible explanation is that cross-linking at this site is greatly decreased by steric hindrance. Interestingly, an earlier study by Beswick and Harding (35Beswick H.T. Harding J.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) shows that changes in the conformation of γ-crystallin take place after glycation with glucose 6-phosphate, and this may prevent cross-linking at the α-amino group. Prabhakaram and Ortwerth (33Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) observe that incorporation of [14C]leucine into protein is ∼20% that obtained with lysine. We also noted that although α-amino groups have much less cross-linking ability than ε-amino groups, cross-linking studies with γB-K2T/K163T suggest that the α-amino group of Gly-1 could form some low level cross-links with itself or with arginine and histidine residues (Fig. 2). By incubating CA, used as an ε-amino group provider, with γB-K2T/K163T, we were able to show that there was significant cross-linking between the ε-amino groups of CA and the non-lysine cross-linking sites of γB-K2T/K163T (Fig. 3). We noted that the quantity of cross-linking products found in the incubation containing CA and wild type γB (lane 3) is higher than that found in CA and γB-K2T/K163T incubation (lane 2). This increased quantity could come from the cross-linking of lysine to lysine and/or lysines of wild type γB to non-lysine sites of CA. When CA alone is incubated with glyceraldehyde, a clear dimer band can be observed on SDS-PAGE, but when CA is incubated with wild type γB or γB-K2T/K163T, the CA-CA dimer bands almost disappear (Fig. 3). CA seems to cross-link more readily with γB-crystallin than with itself, and thus the major cross-linking product is CA-γB rather than CA-CA. Arginines and histidines are thought to be involved in glycation-mediated cross-linking (9Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Okitani A. Cho R.W. Kato H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 1801-1808Google Scholar, 36Slight S.H. Feather M.S. Ortwerth B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Even though bovine γB-crystallin contains 16 arginines and 5 histidines, when both lysines were mutated to threonine, cross-linking was greatly reduced, suggesting that they act only as cross-linking “acceptors” of the glycated ε-amino group. We express our appreciation to Dr. Regine Hay for the gift of bovine γB-crystallin cDNA and to Monsanto Company for the gift of pMON5743 expression vector."
https://openalex.org/W2081465268,"Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is crucial for lung function, including tubular myelin formation and lipid uptake by type II pneumocytes. Known properties of SP-A in vitro are its Ca2+-dependent interaction with phospholipids and its role in the aggregation of liposomes. To dissect and to analyze these processes, we have immobilized SP-A and measured binding of liposomes by the resonant mirror technique. Liposome aggregation was followed separately by kinetic light scattering in suspensions. It was found that SP-A-mediated binding and aggregation of liposomes have a common K0.5 of 20 μm for free Ca2+, independent of the species (sheep, rat, or cow) and of the phospholipid composition, and that both reactions exhibit the same high cooperativity (Hill coefficients of 6–9) for Ca2+ ions. However, binding of liposomes to SP-A is >10-fold faster than aggregation. Both processes are completely reversed by low Ca2+ concentrations, but liposomes dissociate from SP-A in <0.3 s, whereas disaggregation of the liposomes takes ∼30 s. At equilibrium, the level of aggregation depends on the concentration of free SP-A. We interpret these results to be a rapid and reversible sequence of three reactions: (i) a cooperative Ca2+-dependent conformational change in SP-A, (ii) binding of Ca2+-bound SP-A to liposomes, and (iii) aggregation of the Ca2+/SP-A-bound liposomes.

Pulmonary surfactant stabilizes the lung by regulating the surface tension of the alveoli. A key element is thereby the formation of a surface monolayer of phospholipids, mainly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, which lowers surface tension. The monolayer is generated from an “aqueous” compartment, the extracellular alveolar hypophase, which contains surfactant lipids in high concentration and surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D (1Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Google Scholar). Lamellar bodies, tubular myelin, and liposomes within the hypophase are thought to be precursors of the monomolecular surface film (2Suzuki Y. Fujita Y. Kogishi K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 75-81Google Scholar). Surfactant protein A (SP-A) 1The abbreviations used are:SP-Asurfactant protein A;NIRnear-infrared. is the major protein in the alveolar compartment. In vivo, it is tightly associated with lipids (3King R.J. Klass D.J. Gikas E.G. Clements J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 224: 788-795Google Scholar). SP-A is an octadecamer of ∼650 kDa. Its oligomeric structure is formed by identical monomers of ∼28–36 kDa, which appear to be heterogeneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gels due to a different content of carbohydrate chains. The subunits are organized in six trimers, each of which forms a helical structure, mediated by the hydroxyproline-rich collagen-like domain of the SP-A subunit (4White R.T. Damm D. Miller J. Spratt K. Schilling J. Hawgood S. Benson B. Cordell B. Nature. 1985; 317: 361-363Google Scholar,5Voss T. Eistetter H. Schäfer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Google Scholar).SP-A belongs to the lectin family of calcium-binding proteins. Each subunit contains the characteristic structural element of a carboxyl-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. Recent studies support a role of the carbohydrate recognition domain in phospholipid aggregation that is distinct from phospholipid binding (6McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Manson R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Google Scholar). The neck region of SP-A, which links the collagen-like and carbohydrate recognition domains, is mainly involved in phospholipid binding (1Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Google Scholar, 7Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Manson R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Google Scholar,8Ross G.F. Notter R.H. Meuth J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14283-14291Google Scholar). An interesting specificity of SP-A is reflected by its high affinity for phosphatidylcholine and preferentially the main lung lipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (1Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Google Scholar, 9Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3068-3073Google Scholar). Interaction of SP-A with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and surfactant lipid vesicles appears to require extracellular levels of calcium (10Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Google Scholar). In vitro, calcium concentrations in the range of 0.5–5 mm have been shown to induce aggregation (11Efrati H. Hawgood S. Williams M.C. Hong K. Benson B.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7986-7993Google Scholar). This SP-A-mediated surfactant lipid aggregation is thought to play an important role in the phospholipid organization of the alveolar fluid and in surfactant lipid exchange in type II pneumocytes.Lipid binding to SP-A facilitates the uptake of liposomes by type II cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (12Wright J.R. Wagner R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Google Scholar). The intracellular compartment of these cells contains lamellar bodies. Surfactant is stored in these specialized organelles and secreted in the alveolar fluid by exocytosis. SP-A also mediates an inhibition of surfactant secretion (13Wright J.R. Dobbs L.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 395-414Google Scholar). In view of these functions, SP-A appears to have properties for binding, transport, release, and even sorting of phospholipids in the different compartments with their various structural organizations of pulmonary surfactant lipids.This biophysical study, carried out with purified SP-A, provides a building block for understanding these functions. It demonstrates that SP-A controls the level of aggregated phospholipid in a calcium-dependent manner. The results suggest a specific system of coupled reversible reactions. The key element is a Ca2+-dependent, highly cooperative conformational change in the protein, which enables SP-A to bind to liposomes and to induce liposome aggregation. Ca2+sensitivity, reaction times, and reversibility of lipid binding to SP-A and liposome aggregation are compatible with physiological functions of SP-A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of SP-APulmonary surfactant and SP-A were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage of bovine, rat, or sheep lungs according to the method of Hawgood et al. (10Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Google Scholar). Briefly, surfactant was isolated from lung lavage by different centrifugation steps, including a NaBr density gradient. Afterward, SP-A was delipidated with 1-butanol. Repeated extractions with octyl glycopyranoside-containing buffer were followed by dialysis against 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and centrifugation. The protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay and bovine serum albumin as protein standard. The purity of the SP-A preparation was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar).Liposome PreparationAll lipids used were obtained from Sigma. Phospholipid mixtures in CH3OH/CHCl3(1:2) consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/egg phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol/cholesterol (55:25:10:10) were dried under vacuum using a Speed Vac system (Eppendorf Gmbh, Germany) and stored at −40 °C.Lipid films were hydrated in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 μm EGTA to a phospholipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. Samples were sonicated 8 × 15 s at 50 °C with a Bandelin Sonoplus BM 70 disintegrator. Multilamellar liposomes were obtained by 10 repeated freeze-thaw cycles. They were extruded through a polycarbonate membrane of defined pore size (200 nm) using a Lipo-Fast extrusion set. Liposomes produced by extrusion are unilamellar as described previously (15MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Google Scholar).Spectrophotometric AssaysLiposome aggregation was monitored at 400 nm by measurement of turbidity changes using a diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany). Liposomes, prepared as described above, were dissolved in a glass cuvette containing 5 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 μm EGTA, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. 5 μg/ml SP-A was added. After equilibration, aggregation of SP-A was observed upon addition of 2.5 mmCa2+.NIR Light ScatteringLight scattering changes monitoring SP-A-induced liposome aggregation were measured using a steady 820-nm incident beam and were detected at an angular range of 16 ± 2° as described (16Schleicher A. Hofmann K.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 95: 271-278Google Scholar, 17Kahlert M. Pepperberg D.R. Hofmann K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 537-539Google Scholar, 18Ernst O. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10580-10586Google Scholar). Different SP-A and liposome concentrations in a final volume of 300 μl (10-mm microcuvette; 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris, and 50 μm EGTA, pH 7.4) were used. Reactions were started by adding micromolar levels of Ca2+, and light scattering changes were continuously recorded.To investigate a light scattering particle with the refractive index and size of the liposomes (200-nm diameter, smaller than the wavelength of the incident beam), one can apply the Rayleigh-Debye approximation of scattered intensity, I(θ) ∼ ((n/n0)2 − 1)·V 2·P 2(θ)·(1 + cos2θ), where n and n0denote the refractive indices of the scattering particle and of the buffered saline, respectively; V is the particle volume; andP 2(θ) is a particle scattering function that depends on the shape of the particle.Under the conditions of these measurements and for small aggregates, the scattered intensity is dominated by the V 2term (16Schleicher A. Hofmann K.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 95: 271-278Google Scholar), and the intensity of the scattered light (IS) is to a first approximation proportional to the square of the particle volume, V 2. Formation of aggregates of N particles each will increase scattering in proportion to N 2 and, at the same time, reduce the total number of scattering particles in proportion to 1/N. Thus, the time-dependent change in scattered intensity (ΔIS) seen in the Ca2+-induced SP-A-dependent aggregation signals (see “Results”) reflects the increase in the average number of liposomes/aggregate.Control experiments were performed without one of the following in the NIR light scattering assay: SP-A, liposomes, or calcium. Under the experimental conditions used, no significant signals were observed if one component was omitted.Resonant Mirror SpectroscopyExperiments were performed using an IAsys FPC-0001 instrument (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, United Kingdom). SP-A was coupled to the aminosilane surface of the cuvette using the homobifunctional cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. Coupling was carried out in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.7. The buffer was exchanged in Microcon separation kits (Amicon, Inc.). After immobilization of SP-A, the remaining binding sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Signals were obtained using 100 μl of liposome solution in 100 mmNaCl, 50 μm EGTA, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with the addition of a small sample volume of Ca2+ from different stock solutions (100:10:1 mm). Cuvettes were washed with 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and with 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with or without EGTA, depending on the experiment.RESULTSRate and Reversibility of SP-A/Liposome InteractionTo investigate the interaction of lipids with SP-A, liposome binding to immobilized SP-A and their release were studied by the resonant mirror technique. The aggregation of liposomes by SP-A was assayed using the kinetic NIR light scattering method (16Schleicher A. Hofmann K.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 95: 271-278Google Scholar). The two methods enabled us to distinguish between the binding of liposomes to SP-A (Fig. 1 A) and the SP-A-mediated aggregation of the liposomes (Fig. 1 B).Binding of Liposomes to Immobilized SP-AFig. 1 Ashows changes in refractive index within the sensitive layer on the surface of the resonant mirror apparatus. These sensorgrams, measured in units of arc seconds (arc s), reflect changes during calcium-dependent binding or release of liposomes to SP-A bound to the surface chip. It is shown that the addition of Ca2+ leads to a binding signal, indicating transfer of liposomes to immobilized SP-A.The addition of EGTA during the rising phase of the binding signal (Fig. 1 A) produces rapid negative deflections, indicating partial dissociation of the liposomes. The first two additions maintain the full amplitude of the resonant mirror signal of SP-A-bound liposomes, presumably due to free Ca2+ still available. The subsequent back-titration of Ca2+ dissociates the liposomes from SP-A very rapidly, as seen in the dramatic drop of the resonant mirror signal. Full complexation of Ca2+ with equimolar amounts of EGTA recovers the base-line signal. The binding reaction is fully reversible.Fig. 1 A (inset) displays the downward deflection of the resonant mirror signal in real time recording. The measured dissociation of 0.3 s is an upper limit of the actual reaction time since the time resolution of the instrument is in this order of magnitude.Sensorgrams obtained upon coupling of SP-A on the sensor chip were reproducible for liposome binding in nine immobilization experiments. Minor alterations of base-line levels did occur, probably caused by nonspecific liposome interaction on the surface of the sensor chip. After SP-A complex formation under saturating conditions of liposomes, the addition of SP-A and/or more Ca2+ did not change the resonant mirror signal. The affinity sensor monitors changes in the refractive index limited to a surface thickness of ∼200 nm. The observations indicate that liposome aggregation does not interfere with the binding signal from surface-localized SP-A. Neither empty cuvettes without bound SP-A nor heat-denatured SP-A produced any liposome binding signal.Although one can never exclude an influence on the binding kinetics, immobilization of proteins has been applied to a number of investigation purposes. However, precise and rapid Ca2+-dependent liposome binding and its complete reversibility strongly suggest that the SP-A function is maintained after immobilization on the sensor surface. The measured rates are likely to be lower limits for the actual reaction rates in free solution due to limited accessibility of the protein on the sensor surface.SP-A-mediated Aggregation of LiposomesAggregation manifests itself in a change in light scattering (see “Experimental Procedures”). The data in Fig. 1 B are from a typical experiment, with the SP-A/liposome interaction started by addition of Ca2+. The amplitude of the scattering signal (ΔIS) is the recorded intensity change (in volts) at the detector output. The signal arises predominantly from the gain of particle volume by Ca2+-induced, SP-A-mediated liposome aggregation. Controls performed without SP-A or Ca2+ did not show any light scattering changes.The addition of calcium chelators (EDTA or EGTA) during the rise of the signal sets the scattering intensity back to the starting value. As was observed for SP-A binding, partial titration of free Ca2+ reduces the aggregation only partially, and a subsequent second addition of excess Ca2+ elicits again a full aggregation signal (data not shown). These results indicate that, in a certain range of Ca2+ concentrations, the equilibrium level of SP-A-mediated liposome aggregation is sensitive to free Ca2+. The aggregation is completely reversible, with a half-time of complete reversal of aggregation (which we may term “disaggregation”) on the order of 18 s (see Fig.1 B, inset).Influence of Lipid ConcentrationFig. 2 A shows sensorgrams that were obtained when the amount of liposomes in the cuvette was varied. Again, binding to immobilized SP-A was measured. The amount of liposomes is expressed in units of phospholipid concentration. The sensorgrams generally consist of two phases, namely a rapid association phase and a subsequent slower phase. Two exponential functions are sufficient to fit the two phases of the binding signals (Table I). They can be understood as the initial occupation of free binding sites on surface-bound SP-A and a slower equilibration. The initial fast phase takes only a few seconds.Figure 2Effect of different liposome concentrations in resonant mirror spectroscopy (A) and NIR light scattering (B). Approximately 55 ng of coupled rat SP-A (A) or 4.5 nm rat SP-A (B) were incubated with different lipid concentrations in 100 mmNaCl, 50 μm EGTA, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Reactions were started by addition of 90 or 50 μmCa2+. Signals were fitted by two (A) or one (B) exponential function, respectively. Fit values are shown in Tables I and II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IInfluence of lipid concentration on SP-A-induced liposome binding and aggregation: resonance mirror techniqueLipid concA1k1A2k2Liposome concSP-A/liposomeμm(arc s)s −1(arc s)s −1nm1603370.04494310.00290.322.73204070.07513100.00540.641.36405150.10502690.00611.280.712805870.17192340.00822.560.3325606680.19251800.00955.120.17Fit: f(t) = (A1 · (1 − exp(−k1 · t))) + (A2 · (1 − exp(−k2 · t))), whereA1 and A2 = amplitudes of the first and second phases and k1 andk2 = rate constants of the first and second phases. Open table in a new tab Each record is from a new sample, started with the same amount of Ca2+. The resonant mirror signal increases with the concentration of the liposomes, which can be approximately taken from the concentration of lipid, the space occupied by one lipid molecule in a bilayer (0.5 nm2), and the diameter of liposomes on the order of 200 nm. Sensorgrams were analyzed by the equation given in the legend to Table I. The initial reaction rate (kon) depends only slightly on liposome concentration (4-fold change for 16-fold change in liposome concentration). Table I shows also that the total amplitude of both phases is almost independent of liposome concentration, indicating that all available SP-A-binding sites are finally occupied.The NIR light scattering signals (Fig. 2 B) of SP-A-mediated liposome aggregation were obtained under similar conditions. At constant SP-A and Ca2+ concentrations, aggregation depends on lipid concentration. With increasing concentrations of lipid present, SP-A binding and aggregation rates are higher, and the equilibrium between aggregation and disaggregation is shifted toward the aggregated state.The time course of the scattering signals fits well to a single exponential function see Table II. Again, konvaries only slightly with the lipid concentration (4-fold change for 16-fold change in lipid). Generally and at any concentration of the lipid, binding to SP-A (Fig. 2 A) is much faster than SP-A-mediated liposome aggregation (Fig. 2 B).Table IIInfluence of lipid concentration on SP-A-induced liposome binding and aggregation: NIR light scatteringLipid concAkLiposome concSP-A/liposomeμmVs −1nm802.720.00050.16281603.810.00090.32143204.560.00110.6476404.200.00151.283.512804.300.00212.561.8Fit: f(x) = A · (1 − exp(−k · t)), where A = amplitudes and k = rate constants. Open table in a new tab The estimated volumetric equivalent concentration of SP-A in the resonant mirror cuvette, as calculated from the amount of SP-A coupled on the surface of the sensor chip and the cuvette volume, is on the order of 1 nm. The light scattering experiments employed 4.5 nm SP-A. Thus, although the SP-A concentration in the resonant mirror experiments was lower (one-fifth), thekon of the binding signals was at least an order of magnitude higher than that of aggregation. This is consistent with fast binding between SP-A and liposomes, followed by slower aggregation.Influence of SP-A ConcentrationHigher SP-A levels in the liposome NIR scattering experiments give rise to higher aggregation signals. Fig. 3 shows light scattering signals at constant Ca2+ and lipid concentrations. It is shown that the rate and extent of aggregation depend on the concentration of SP-A, indicating that the SP-A bound after a short time (see Figs. 1 A and 2 A) governs the aggregation process. The amplitude and konvalue of liposome aggregation rise in proportion to the amount of SP-A present. kon values become higher because the more SP-A is present, the faster SP-A·liposome complexes are formed. Different amplitudes reflect that size and/or number of liposome aggregates depends on the amount of SP-A in solution. Analogous observations were made with SP-A from different species (rat, sheep, and cow).Figure 3Effect of different SP-A concentrations on aggregation monitored by NIR light scattering.

The original concentration in the saline buffer (typically 20 μm) was measured spectrophotometrically, using arsenazo III (19Yingst D.R. Hoffman J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 431-448Google Scholar). Ca2+ was first adjusted to a low initial concentration by EGTA (50 μm).

This is consistent with the conclusion reached above that aggregation is dependent on and follows SP-A/lipid association induced by micromolar Ca2+. It does not exclude an additional influence of Ca2+ at higher concentrations: the aggregation process by itself may well depend on high Ca2+ concentrations as described previously (10Hawgood S. Benson B.J. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Google Scholar, 20King R.J. Exp. Lung Res. 1984; 6: 237-253Google Scholar,21Haagsman H.P. Elfring R.H. van Buel B.L.M. Voorhout W.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 273-276Google Scholar).Cooperativity of Liposome Binding to SP-AThe data in Fig. 4 demonstrate that SP-A does not interact with liposomes at low free Ca2+ concentrations. Within a narrow range of concentration, the addition of Ca2+ starts to induce the structural transitions reflected in the SP-A-dependent interactions, indicating a cooperative mode of SP-A action in both binding and aggregation. We conclude that SP-A exists in (at least) two states, namely a calcium-depleted form that does not interact with liposomes and one or several interacting forms that bind calcium cooperatively.To obtain more quantitative information, the coupled SP-A on the aminosilane surface of the resonant mirror offers the possibility of a treatment with high concentrations of EGTA to reduce the Ca2+ bound to SP-A to a great extent. The actual concentration of free Ca2+ can then be estimated after Ca2+ determination in buffer and known addition of EGTA and Ca2+. Fig. 5 is a plot of the resulting levels of lipid binding depending on free Ca2+. The Hill coefficient, based on a computer fit to the data, was on the order of 6–9 (see Table IV), and K0.5 was ∼20 μm free Ca2+ for all species investigated (sheep, rat, and cow; data not shown).Figure 515 ng of coupled sheep SP-A were washed with EGTA and incubated with 640 μm lipids in 100 mmNaCl, 50 μm EGTA, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have analyzed the functions of SP-A. The biophysical techniques applied enabled us to differentiate between its Ca2+-dependent interaction with phospholipids and its role in the aggregation of liposomes. Both these processes are closely coupled in situ. Our analysis shows how they are concatenated as two partial steps of one Ca2+-dependent overall process.Liposome Binding to SP-AWe used immobilized SP-A to monitor the binding and release of liposomes to and from the protein by changes in the refractive index at an affinity sensor surface (binding signals). Binding of liposomes to SP-A occurs upon addition of Ca2+ concentrations in the micromolar range (K0.5 = 22 ± 3 μm free Ca2+). The association rate constants (kon) rise in proportion to the lipid concentration, which is consistent with a mechanism of collisional coupling between liposomes and immobilized SP-A (Fig. 2 A and Table I). Successful coupling requires a Ca2+-dependent form of SP-A, presumably a specific conformation. We have also seen that removal of Ca2+, e.g. by addition of EGTA, switches SP-A back to an inactive form, leading to very rapid dissociation of liposomes. This Ca2+-dependent switch of the SP-A/liposome interaction operates in a wide range of phospholipid compositions and for SP-A from different species. The observed switch of the SP-A conformation fits well with a class of binding sites withKD on the order of 10 μm (22Haagsman H.P. Sargeant T. Hauschka P.V. Benson B.J. Hawgood S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8894-8900Google Scholar). Conformational changes in SP-A that result from Ca2+binding in the absence of lipids were detected by fluorescence spectroscopy by Sohma et al. (23Sohma H. Watanabe T. Kuroki Y. Yoshino H. Matsushima N. Yazawa M. Akino T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 150-154Google Scholar). They found increased fluorescence intensities of SP-A with half-maximal changes of ∼60 μm Ca2+ added.In terms of the subunit structure of SP-A, it is now an interesting question of how Ca2+ triggers the change in structure of SP-A that leads to the observed effect. Suggested regions for binding of lipid include the neck plus carbohydrate recognition domains of the SP-A subunits (6McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Manson R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Google Scholar, 7Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Manson R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Google Scholar, 8Ross G.F. Notter R.H. Meuth J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14283-14291Google Scholar), which form a bouquet-like structure in the octadecamer (5Voss T. Eistetter H. Schäfer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Google Scholar).Liposome AggregationKinetic light scattering has revealed that liposome aggregation is similar in its Ca2+dependence, but always lags behind the liposome binding reaction. Remarkably, the rise and equilibrium level of aggregation depend on the concentration of SP-A in the sample, which shows that the protein controls the aggregation process. Our results confirm that reversal of aggregation (disaggregation) of SP-A·liposome complexes can be achieved by the mere addition of EGTA or EDTA in excess of calcium concentrations, as reported by others (11Efrati H. Hawgood S. William"
