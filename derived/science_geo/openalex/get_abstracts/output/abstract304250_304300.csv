https://openalex.org/W2035652339,"Radio spectral line radiation of water molecules at a wavelength of 1.35 centimeters has been measured from eight sources in the galaxy. The sources are less than 1 arc minute in diameter, have extremely high brightness temperatures, and show many spectral features. Some spectral features are slightly polarized and some have changed greatly in intensity in a few weeks time."

https://openalex.org/W2040369835,"Analysis of data on the spectral reflectivity curves for both bright and dark areas of Mars disclosed several features not considered in previous models of the martian surface. The shape of the mean spectral geometric albedo curve between 0.3 and about 1.3 microns for Mars is defined to within a few percent. Spectral reflectivity curves based on relative reflectivity data were calculated for both a bright and a dark region between 0.4 and 1.1 microns. The curve for the dark region shows a broad, deep (âˆ¼13 percent) absorption feature centered near 1 micron. The curve for the dark area crosses that of the bright area between 0.4 and 0.5 micron during some martian seasons."

https://openalex.org/W1990338907,"In natural scapolites the cell dimension a shows a regular increase from marialite to meionite composition, while c remains constant. Both a and c of synthetic meionite are larger than the corresponding dimensions of synthetic marialite. The cell volume of both natural and synthetic scapolites is a nearly linear function of composition. Variations in cell dimensions of scapolites may be caused by differences in structural state similar to those in plagioclase feldspars."
https://openalex.org/W1994828757,"The heartwoods of tree species containing tropolone compounds in their extractive components are classed among the more durable woods. Two new tropolones, namely, alpha-thujaplicinol and pygmaein from the heartwood of Cupressus pygmaea, were also found to exhibit strong fungitoxic properties active against a number of wood-destroying fungi. The hydroxyl group appears to be the functional grouping which is largely responsible for the fungicidal action exhibited by this type of compound."
https://openalex.org/W2018483516,The parasite Amallocystis capillosus has appeared on the shrimp Pasiphaea pacifica. This is the first report of this group of parasites from the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The parasite causes a morphological modification of the rostrum of the host.

https://openalex.org/W4255139539,An experiment designed to detect the bulk flow of cool plasma within the magnetosphere has been flown on the ATS-1 (Applications Technology Satellite) synchronous satellite. This experiment has yielded evidence for gusts of streaming positive ions in the magnetospheric equatorial plane. This directed ion flow is interpreted as the result of large-scale electric fields of the order of several millivolts per meter.

https://openalex.org/W1996891933,"Neutron activation analysis was used to measure phosphorus in individual beetle wings during pupal and early adult stages. By counting neutroninduced P(32) radioactivity it was possible to measure 0.005 +/- 0.001, microg of phosphorus. The phosphorus content of the wings rises to maximum at eclosion and subsequently decreases with loss of cells."

https://openalex.org/W1966399134,"Exposure to x-rays of low intensity immediately arouses the sleeping rat. Activation of the central nervous system, indicated by behavioral and heart rate responses, depends upon the rate but not the dose of exposure. The arousal reaction is not dependent upon direct visual stimulation. The nervous system is probably directly sensitive to ionizing radiation."
