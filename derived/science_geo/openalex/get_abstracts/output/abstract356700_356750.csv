https://openalex.org/W2139420873,"Face processing, amongst many basic visual skills, is thought to be invariant across all humans. From as early as 1965, studies of eye movements have consistently revealed a systematic triangular sequence of fixations over the eyes and the mouth, suggesting that faces elicit a universal, biologically-determined information extraction pattern.Here we monitored the eye movements of Western Caucasian and East Asian observers while they learned, recognized, and categorized by race Western Caucasian and East Asian faces. Western Caucasian observers reproduced a scattered triangular pattern of fixations for faces of both races and across tasks. Contrary to intuition, East Asian observers focused more on the central region of the face.These results demonstrate that face processing can no longer be considered as arising from a universal series of perceptual events. The strategy employed to extract visual information from faces differs across cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2146003031,"Background The study investigated the residual impact of eyeblinks on the electroencephalogram (EEG) after application of different correction procedures, namely a regression method (eye movement correction procedure, EMCP) and a component based method (Independent Component Analysis, ICA). Methodology/Principle Findings Real and simulated data were investigated with respect to blink-related potentials and the residual mutual information of uncorrected vertical electrooculogram (EOG) and corrected EEG, which is a measure of residual EOG contribution to the EEG. The results reveal an occipital positivity that peaks at about 250ms after the maximum blink excursion following application of either correction procedure. This positivity was not observable in the simulated data. Mutual information of vertical EOG and EEG depended on the applied regression procedure. In addition, different correction results were obtained for real and simulated data. ICA yielded almost perfect correction in all conditions. However, under certain conditions EMCP yielded comparable results to the ICA approach. Conclusion In conclusion, for EMCP the quality of correction depended on the EMCP variant used and the structure of the data, whereas ICA always yielded almost perfect correction. However, its disadvantage is the much more complex data processing, and that it requires a suitable amount of data."

Despite previous studies on immune responses induced by these two vaccines, a comparative study of the influence of prior influenza vaccination on serum antibody and B-cell responses to new LAIV or TIV vaccination has not been reported. During the 2005/6 influenza season, we quantified the serum antibody and B-cell responses to LAIV or TIV in adults with differing influenza vaccination histories in the prior year: LAIV, TIV, or neither. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 7-9 and 21-35 after immunization and used for serum HAI assay and B-cell assays. Total and influenza-specific circulating IgG and IgA antibody secreting cells (ASC) in PBMC were detected by direct ELISPOT assay. Memory B cells were also tested by ELISPOT after polyclonal stimulation of PBMC in vitro. Serum antibody, effector, and memory B-cell responses were greater in TIV recipients than LAIV recipients. Prior year TIV recipients had significantly higher baseline HAI titers, but lower HAI response after vaccination with either TIV or LAIV, and lower IgA ASC response after vaccination with TIV than prior year LAIV or no vaccination recipients. Lower levels of baseline HAI titer were associated with a greater fold-increase of HAI titer and ASC number after vaccination, which also differed by type of vaccine. Our findings suggest that the type of vaccine received in the prior year affects the serum antibody and the B-cell responses to subsequent vaccination. In particular, prior year TIV vaccination is associated with sustained higher HAI titer one year later but lower antibody response to new LAIV or TIV vaccination, and a lower effector B-cell response to new TIV but not LAIV vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W1983533553,"A-type lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins encoded by the gene LMNA. Mutations in LMNA give rise to diverse degenerative diseases related to premature ageing. A-type lamins also influence the activity of the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and oncogenes such a beta-catenin. Consequently, it has been speculated that expression of A-type lamins may also influence tumour progression.An archive of colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal colon tissue was screened for expression of A-type lamins. We used the Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) method to investigate patient survival. Using CRC cell lines we investigated the effects of lamin A expression on other genes by RT-PCR; on cell growth by FACS analysis; and on invasiveness by cell migration assays and siRNA knockdown of targeted genes. We found that lamin A is expressed in colonic stem cells and that patients with A-type lamin-expressing tumours have significantly worse prognosis than patients with A-type lamin negative tumours (HR = 1.85, p = 0.005). To understand this finding, we established a model system based upon expression of GFP-lamin A in CRC cells. We found that expression of GFP-lamin A in these cells did not affect cell proliferation but did promote greatly increased cell motility and invasiveness. The reason for this increased invasiveness was that expression of lamin A promoted up-regulation of the actin bundling protein T-plastin, leading to down regulation of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin.Expression of A-type lamins increases the risk of death from CRC because its presence gives rise to increased invasiveness and potentially a more stem cell-like phenotype. This report directly links A-type lamin expression to tumour progression and raises the profile of LMNA from one implicated in multiple but rare genetic conditions to a gene involved in one of the commonest diseases in the Western World."
https://openalex.org/W2157615753,"Background One of the major tenets in breast cancer research is that early detection is vital for patient survival by increasing treatment options. To that end, we have previously used a novel unsupervised approach to identify a set of genes whose expression predicts prognosis of breast cancer patients. The predictive genes were selected in a well-defined three dimensional (3D) cell culture model of non-malignant human mammary epithelial cell morphogenesis as down-regulated during breast epithelial cell acinar formation and cell cycle arrest. Here we examine the ability of this gene signature (3D-signature) to predict prognosis in three independent breast cancer microarray datasets having 295, 286, and 118 samples, respectively. Methods and Findings Our results show that the 3D-signature accurately predicts prognosis in three unrelated patient datasets. At 10 years, the probability of positive outcome was 52, 51, and 47 percent in the group with a poor-prognosis signature and 91, 75, and 71 percent in the group with a good-prognosis signature for the three datasets, respectively (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, p<0.05). Hazard ratios for poor outcome were 5.5 (95% CI 3.0 to 12.2, p<0.0001), 2.4 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.6, p<0.0001) and 1.9 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.2, p = 0.016) and remained significant for the two larger datasets when corrected for estrogen receptor (ER) status. Hence the 3D-signature accurately predicts breast cancer outcome in both ER-positive and ER-negative tumors, though individual genes differed in their prognostic ability in the two subtypes. Genes that were prognostic in ER+ patients are AURKA, CEP55, RRM2, EPHA2, FGFBP1, and VRK1, while genes prognostic in ER− patients include ACTB, FOXM1 and SERPINE2 (Kaplan-Meier p<0.05). Multivariable Cox regression analysis in the largest dataset showed that the 3D-signature was a strong independent factor in predicting breast cancer outcome. Conclusions The 3D-signature accurately predicts breast cancer outcome across multiple datasets and holds prognostic value for both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer. The signature was selected using a novel biological approach and hence holds promise to represent the key biological processes of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2094435527,"Background Embryonic stem (ES) cells self-renew as coherent colonies in which cells maintain tight cell-cell contact. Although intercellular communications are essential to establish the basis of cell-specific identity, molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic cell-cell interactions in ES cells at the signaling level remain underexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that endogenous Rho signaling is required for the maintenance of cell-cell contacts in ES cells. siRNA-mediated loss of function experiments demonstrated that Rock, a major effector kinase downstream of Rho, played a key role in the formation of cell-cell junctional assemblies through regulation of myosin II by controlling a myosin light chain phosphatase. Chemical engineering of this signaling axis by a Rock-specific inhibitor revealed that cell-cell adhesion was reversibly controllable and dispensable for self-renewal of mouse ES cells as confirmed by chimera assay. Furthermore, a novel culture system combining a single synthetic matrix, defined medium, and the Rock inhibitor fully warranted human ES cell self-renewal independent of animal-derived matrices, tight cell contacts, or fibroblastic niche-forming cells as determined by teratoma formation assay. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate an essential role of the Rho-Rock-Myosin signaling axis for the regulation of basic cell-cell communications in both mouse and human ES cells, and would contribute to advance in medically compatible xeno-free environments for human pluripotent stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970049038,"Rare mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR) cause familial hypercholesterolemia, which increases the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Less is known about the implications of common genetic variation in the LDLR gene regarding the variability of cholesterol levels and risk of CAD.Imputed genotype data at the LDLR locus on 1 644 individuals of a population-based sample were explored for association with LDL-C level. Replication of association with LDL-C level was sought for the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the LDLR gene in three European samples comprising 6 642 adults and 533 children. Association of this SNP with CAD was examined in six case-control studies involving more than 15 000 individuals.Each copy of the minor T allele of SNP rs2228671 within LDLR (frequency 11%) was related to a decrease of LDL-C levels by 0.19 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.13-0.24] mmol/L, p = 1.5x10(-10)). This association with LDL-C was uniformly found in children, men, and women of all samples studied. In parallel, the T allele of rs2228671 was associated with a significantly lower risk of CAD (Odds Ratio per copy of the T allele: 0.82, 95% CI [0.76-0.89], p = 2.1x10(-7)). Adjustment for LDL-C levels by logistic regression or Mendelian Randomisation models abolished the significant association between rs2228671 with CAD completely, indicating a functional link between the genetic variant at the LDLR gene locus, change in LDL-C and risk of CAD.A common variant at the LDLR gene locus affects LDL-C levels and, thereby, the risk for CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2013767844,"Human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) results from foodborne transmission of prions from slaughtered cattle with classical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (cBSE). Atypical forms of BSE, which remain mostly asymptomatic in aging cattle, were recently identified at slaughterhouses throughout Europe and North America, raising a question about human susceptibility to these new prion strains.Brain homogenates from cattle with classical BSE and atypical (BASE) infections were inoculated intracerebrally into cynomolgus monkeys (Macacca fascicularis), a non-human primate model previously demonstrated to be susceptible to the original strain of cBSE. The resulting diseases were compared in terms of clinical signs, histology and biochemistry of the abnormal prion protein (PrPres). The single monkey infected with BASE had a shorter survival, and a different clinical evolution, histopathology, and prion protein (PrPres) pattern than was observed for either classical BSE or vCJD-inoculated animals. Also, the biochemical signature of PrPres in the BASE-inoculated animal was found to have a higher proteinase K sensitivity of the octa-repeat region. We found the same biochemical signature in three of four human patients with sporadic CJD and an MM type 2 PrP genotype who lived in the same country as the infected bovine.Our results point to a possibly higher degree of pathogenicity of BASE than classical BSE in primates and also raise a question about a possible link to one uncommon subset of cases of apparently sporadic CJD. Thus, despite the waning epidemic of classical BSE, the occurrence of atypical strains should temper the urge to relax measures currently in place to protect public health from accidental contamination by BSE-contaminated products."
https://openalex.org/W2046214303,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in various physiological processes through post-transcriptional regulation of gene expressions and are involved in development, metabolism, and many other important molecular mechanisms and cellular processes. The Bombyx mori genome sequence provides opportunities for a thorough survey for miRNAs as well as comparative analyses with other sequenced insect species.We identified 114 non-redundant conserved miRNAs and 148 novel putative miRNAs from the B. mori genome with an elaborate computational protocol. We also sequenced 6,720 clones from 14 developmental stage-specific small RNA libraries in which we identified 35 unique miRNAs containing 21 conserved miRNAs (including 17 predicted miRNAs) and 14 novel miRNAs (including 11 predicted novel miRNAs). Among the 114 conserved miRNAs, we found six pairs of clusters evolutionarily conserved cross insect lineages. Our observations on length heterogeneity at 5' and/or 3' ends of nine miRNAs between cloned and predicted sequences, and three mature forms deriving from the same arm of putative pre-miRNAs suggest a mechanism by which miRNAs gain new functions. Analyzing development-related miRNAs expression at 14 developmental stages based on clone-sampling and stem-loop RT PCR, we discovered an unusual abundance of 33 sequences representing 12 different miRNAs and sharply fluctuated expression of miRNAs at larva-molting stage. The potential functions of several stage-biased miRNAs were also analyzed in combination with predicted target genes and silkworm's phenotypic traits; our results indicated that miRNAs may play key regulatory roles in specific developmental stages in the silkworm, such as ecdysis.Taking a combined approach, we identified 118 conserved miRNAs and 151 novel miRNA candidates from the B. mori genome sequence. Our expression analyses by sampling miRNAs and real-time PCR over multiple developmental stages allowed us to pinpoint molting stages as hotspots of miRNA expression both in sorts and quantities. Based on the analysis of target genes, we hypothesized that miRNAs regulate development through a particular emphasis on complex stages rather than general regulatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1995825130,"Background Adaptation is an evolutionary process in which traits in a population are tailored by natural selection to better meet the challenges presented by the local environment. The major discussion relating to natural selection concerns the portraying of the cause and effect relationship between a presumably adaptive trait and selection agents generating it. Therefore, it is necessary to identify trait(s) that evolve in direct response to selection, enhancing the organism's fitness. “Evolution Canyon” (EC) in Israel mirrors a microcosmic evolutionary system across life and is ideal to study natural selection and local adaptation under sharply, microclimatically divergent environments. The south-facing, tropical, sunny and xeric “African” slope (AS) receives 200%–800% higher solar radiation than the north-facing, temperate, shady and mesic “European” slope (ES), 200 meters apart. Thus, solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a major selection agent in EC influencing the organism-environment interaction. Melanin is a trait postulated to have evolved for UV-screening in microorganisms. Here we investigate the cause and effect relationship between differential UVR on the opposing slopes of EC and the conidial melanin concentration of the filamentous soil fungus Aspergillus niger. We test the working hypothesis that the AS strains exhibit higher melanin content than strains from the ES resulting in higher UV resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings We measured conidial melanin concentration of 80 strains from the EC using a spectrophotometer. The results indicated that mean conidial melanin concentration of AS strains were threefold higher than ES strains and the former resisted UVA irradiation better than the latter. Comparisons of melanin in the conidia of A. niger strains from sunny and shady microniches on the predominantly sunny AS and predominantly shady ES indicated that shady conditions on the AS have no influence on the selection on melanin; in contrast, the sunny strains from the ES displayed higher melanin concentrations. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that melanin in A. niger is an adaptive trait against UVR generated by natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W2013673267,"Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors (HAI)-1 and -2 are recently identified and closely related Kunitz-type transmembrane serine protease inhibitors. Whereas HAI-1 is well established as an inhibitor of the serine proteases matriptase and hepatocyte growth factor activator, the physiological targets of HAI-2 are unknown. Here we show that HAI-2 displays potent inhibitory activity toward matriptase, forms SDS-stable complexes with the serine protease, and blocks matriptase-dependent activation of its candidate physiological substrates proprostasin and cell surface-bound pro-urokinase plasminogen activator. To further explore the potential functional relationship between HAI-2 and matriptase, we generated a transgenic mouse strain with a promoterless beta-galactosidase marker gene inserted into the endogenous locus encoding HAI-2 protein and performed a global high resolution mapping of the expression of HAI-2, matriptase, and HAI-1 proteins in all adult tissues. This analysis showed striking co-localization of HAI-2 with matriptase and HAI-1 in epithelial cells of all major organ systems, thus strongly supporting a role of HAI-2 as a physiological regulator of matriptase activity, possibly acting in a redundant or partially redundant manner with HAI-1. Unlike HAI-1 and matriptase, however, HAI-2 expression was also detected in non-epithelial cells of brain and lymph nodes, suggesting that HAI-2 may also be involved in inhibition of serine proteases other than matriptase."
https://openalex.org/W2099757149,"It is unclear whether C-reactive protein (CRP) is causally related to coronary heart disease (CHD). Genetic variants that are known to be associated with CRP levels can be used to provide causal inference of the effect of CRP on CHD. Our objective was to examine the association between CRP genetic variant +1444C>T (rs1130864) and CHD risk in the largest study to date of this association.We estimated the association of CRP genetic variant +1444C>T (rs1130864) with CRP levels and with CHD in five studies and then pooled these analyses (N = 18,637 participants amongst whom there were 4,610 cases). CRP was associated with potential confounding factors (socioeconomic position, physical activity, smoking and body mass) whereas genotype (rs1130864) was not associated with these confounders. The pooled odds ratio of CHD per doubling of circulating CRP level after adjustment for age and sex was 1.13 (95%CI: 1.06, 1.21), and after further adjustment for confounding factors it was 1.07 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.13). Genotype (rs1130864) was associated with circulating CRP; the pooled ratio of geometric means of CRP level among individuals with the TT genotype compared to those with the CT/CC genotype was 1.21 (95%CI: 1.15, 1.28) and the pooled ratio of geometric means of CRP level per additional T allele was 1.14 (95%CI: 1.11, 1.18), with no strong evidence in either analyses of between study heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%, p>0.9 for both analyses). There was no association of genotype (rs1130864) with CHD: pooled odds ratio 1.01 (95%CI: 0.88, 1.16) comparing individuals with TT genotype to those with CT/CC genotype and 0.96 (95%CI: 0.90, 1.03) per additional T allele (I(2)<7.5%, p>0.6 for both meta-analyses). An instrumental variables analysis (in which the proportion of CRP levels explained by rs1130864 was related to CHD) suggested that circulating CRP was not associated with CHD: the odds ratio for a doubling of CRP level was 1.04 (95%CI: 0.61, 1.80).We found no association of a genetic variant, which is known to be related to CRP levels, (rs1130864) and having CHD. These findings do not support a causal association between circulating CRP and CHD risk, but very large, extended, genetic association studies would be required to rule this out."

Septins are implicated in many human diseases including cancer and neuropathies. Small molecules that reversibly perturb septin organization and function would be valuable tools for dissecting septin functions and could be used for therapeutic treatment of septin-related diseases. Forchlorfenuron (FCF) is a plant cytokinin previously shown to disrupt septin localization in budding yeast. However, it is unknown whether FCF directly targets septins and whether it affects septin organization and functions in mammalian cells. Here, we show that FCF alters septin assembly in vitro without affecting either actin or tubulin polymerization. In live mammalian cells, FCF dampens septin dynamics and induces the assembly of abnormally large septin structures. FCF has a low level of cytotoxicity, and these effects are reversed upon FCF washout. Significantly, FCF treatment induces mitotic and cell migration defects that phenocopy the effects of septin depletion by small interfering RNA.

In neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer disease), septins are present in cytosplasmic inclusions and neurofibrillary tangles, and a septin isoform (SEPT4) was recently shown to suppress α-synuclein neurotoxicity in Parkinson disease (37Kinoshita A.

Finally, some septins have been identified as host proteins involved in viral and bacterial infections (40Kim C.S. Seol S.K. Song O.K. Park J.H. Jang S.K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3852-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 41Pizarro-Cerda J. Jonquieres R. Gouin E. Vandekerckhove J. Garin J. Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Various tools have been developed to study septin organization and functions, including function-blocking antibodies and RNA interference. However, these reagents are not readily reversible, and we have, therefore, turned to small molecule compounds, which could also be of therapeutic value in translational research. A recent study showed that the plant cytokinin forchlorfenuron (FCF; 2The abbreviations used are: FCF, forchlorfenuron; MDCK, madin-darby canine kidney; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; CENP-E, centromere associated protein E; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FI, fluorescence intensities; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea, 4PU300) disrupted septin localization and caused cytokinesis defects in budding yeast (42Iwase M. Okada S. Oguchi T. Toh-e A. Genes Genet. Syst. 2004; 79: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether FCF directly and specifically affected septins, and if so, how FCF affected septin organization and functions. Here, we analyzed the effects of FCF on mammalian septins using recombinant SEPT2/6/7 as an in vitro septin assembly system and mammalian cells to study effects in vivo. Our studies show that FCF directly alters septin assembly in vitro and affects septin organization in mammalian cells by stabilizing septin filaments; these effects of FCF in cells are reversible upon FCF washout. Cells treated with FCF display mitosis defects and decreased cell migration that phenocopy the effects of septin knockdown by siRNAs. Cell Culture, Cell Synchronization, and siRNA Transfections—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) clone II and HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) cells were maintained as described previously (18Spiliotis E.T. Kinoshita M. Nelson W.J. Science. 2005; 307: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). HeLa S3 cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MDCK-SEPT2-YFP (18Spiliotis E.T. Kinoshita M. Nelson W.J. Science. 2005; 307: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), MDCK-actin-GFP (43Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), and HeLa-α-tubulin-GFP (a gift from L. Wordeman, University of Washington) cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5 mg/ml G418. HeLa S3 cells were synchronized in mitosis by blocking with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 18 h followed by a 4-h release into regular media, and a 12-h incubation with nocodazole (Sigma; 40 ng/ml). HeLa cells were transfected with siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA and SEPT2 siRNAs as described previously (18Spiliotis E.T. Kinoshita M. Nelson W.J. Science. 2005; 307: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Assembly of Recombinant SEPT2/6/7 in Vitro—Recombinant His-SEPT2/6/7 was purified from insect cells and assembled into filamentous structures as described previously (9Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Briefly, His-SEPT2/6/7 was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, diluted to ∼0.2 mg/ml, and dialyzed against low salt buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of FCF (Sigma) or DMSO (Sigma) at 4 °C. Assembly of higher-order SEPT2/6/7 filaments was reversed by dialysis in high salt buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 12 h. Septin structures were transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (EM Sciences) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, and stained with anti-SEPT2 (N5N; rabbit polyclonal antibody). The surface area of septin structures was quantified using the ImageJ software. Negative stain electron microscopy was performed by adsorbing His-SEPT2/6/7 complexes onto glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids (200 mesh copper hexagonal) for 2 min. Samples were washed twice with water and stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 2 min. Following staining, samples were dried and examined with a CM-12 Philips transmission electron microscope. In pelleting assays of recombinant septin assembly, higher-ordered filamentous structures were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants and pellets were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Actin and Microtubule Polymerization Assays—Pyrene actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) polymerization assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of different concentrations of FCF or DMSO. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd.; excitation 360 nm, emission 405 nm). A bovine tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) polymerization assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of various concentrations of FCF or DMSO. Turbidity was measured at 340 nm using a plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd.). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Subconfluent cells were fixed with warm PHEM (60 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 6.9, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2) containing 3% paraformaldehyde (EM Sciences) and 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained with antisera to SEPT2 (N5N; rabbit polyclonal antibody), SEPT7 (anti-SEPT7; rabbit polyclonal antibody), α-tubulin (DM1α; Sigma-Aldrich), and secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine red X-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Microfilaments were stained with Alexa Fluor-355-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). Samples were mounted in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and imaged with an inverted Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 200) or the Marianas system (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Cell morphology (axis length ratio) was quantified using the Statistics module in the Slidebook 4.2 software. Staining of MDCK cells for centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) and CREST serum was performed as described previously (18Spiliotis E.T. Kinoshita M. Nelson W.J. Science. 2005; 307: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Images were captured and deconvolved with an Applied Precision Delta Vision wide field deconvolution system (×63 oil objective; ×1.5 optovar). Quantification of CENP-E-containing kinetochores (n =∼100 per cell) was performed in every fourth optical section from a deconvolved z-stack. Cytotoxicity Assays—HeLa or MDCK cells were plated overnight on collagen-coated 35-mm tissue culture dishes and then treated with DMSO or FCF for 4 h. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with trypan blue (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 min. Blue and non-blue cells were counted using a hemocytometer. For alamarBlue assays, HeLa cells (1 × 104/well) were plated onto a 96-well plate (Costar) and cultured overnight. Cells were then treated with FCF or DMSO, and 50 μl of medium was removed and mixed with 5.5 μl of alamarBlue reagent (AbD Serotec) for 2 h. Fluorescence intensities were measured using a plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd.; excitation 560 nm, emission 590 nm). Each measurement was performed in quadruplicates. Live Cell Imaging and FRAP—Cells were grown on collagen-coated coverslips for 24 h at subconfluent density and imaged in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mm Hepes (Invitrogen) using the Marianas system (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) equipped with the MicroPoint fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) laser system (Photonic Instruments). Photobleaching experiments were carried out using the FRAP module of the Marianas system. Equivalent laser intensity, repetition, and exposure time were used for FRAP measurements in FCF- or DMSO-treated samples. Bleached areas were accurately positioned along septin filaments, actin stress fibers, or microtubule bundles. Images were taken 5 s before photobleaching and 5 min after photobleaching at a rate of one frame per second. Fluorescence intensities were quantified after background subtraction and normalization against unbleached areas using the Slidebook 4.2 software as described previously (43Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Cell. 2005; 123: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities (FI) were plotted against time (t) and fitted to an exponential recovery curve: FI = FIst - (FIst - FIblch)exp(-In2 × T/t½) in which FIblch is the fluorescence intensity at the time of bleaching, and FIst is the fluorescence intensity at the final steady status. From this equation, half-times of fluorescence recovery were derived. The koff was calculated as In2/t½, and recovery percentage was calculated as: ((FIst - FIblch)/(FIprebleach - FIblch)) × 100 in which FIprebleach is the fluorescence intensity before photobleaching (44Bulinski J.C. Odde D.J. Howell B.J. Salmon T.D. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3885-3897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Plots and curve fittings were performed with the Origin 6.1 software. Cell Motility and Wound-healing Assays—A modified cell motility assay was used (46Turner D.P. Moussa O. Sauane M. Fisher P.B. Watson D.K. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1618-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fluorescent beads (1 μm Fluo-Spheres; Invitrogen) were vortexed, sonicated, and plated onto 18-mm coverslips precoated with collagen and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Excess beads were washed off, and HeLa cells (3 × 103) were plated for 16 h at 37 °C in DMEM and 10% FBS. Cells were fixed, random images were taken, and the surface areas covered by single cells were quantified using the ImageJ software. For wound-healing assays, HeLa cells (2 × 106) were grown on 35-mm dishes overnight in DMEM and 10% FBS. MDCK cells were first plated in low calcium DMEM (5 μm Ca2+) and 10% dialyzed FBS for 75 min, and then the medium was exchanged for DMEM with 10% FBS. Confluent monolayers were scratched with a pipette tip. HeLa and MDCK cells were imaged for 8 and 14 h, respectively. Displacement surface areas (ΔArea) were calculated as Si - St in which Si is the initial wounded surface area and St is the wounded surface area at time point t. The surface areas were quantified using ImageJ. FCF Alters SEPT2/6/7 Assembly in Vitro—To determine whether FCF (Fig. 1A) has a direct effect on mammalian septin assembly, we used recombinant SEPT2/6/7 complex purified from insect cells (9Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). SEPT2/6/7 complexes were dialyzed in the presence of FCF or DMSO (the vehicle for FCF) in low salt buffer to induce septin self-assembly into higher-order structures, which were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B) or transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1F). Under control conditions (DMSO), SEPT2/6/7 complexes assembled into filamentous structures as reported previously (9Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In the presence of 20 μm FCF, SEPT2/6/7 complexes formed structures that were larger and denser than those formed in DMSO (Fig. 1B). These structures were highly inter-twined (Fig. 1B, see inset) and had significantly larger surface area than control filaments (Fig. 1, C and D), giving rise to a higher percentage (30.2% versus 6.2%) of structures with a surface area greater than 500 μm2 (Fig. 1D). The effect of FCF on SEPT2/6/7 assembly was concentration-dependent, with a significant effect at a concentration as low as 5 μm (Fig. 1E), and was reversible upon dialysis of filaments in high salt buffer with-out FCF (supplemental Fig. 1). The ultrastructure of septin filaments assembled in vitro in the presence or absence of FCF was examined by transmission electron microscopy. In DMSO, SEPT2/6/7 formed extended fibers with an average diameter of 10.9 ± 0.3 nm (n = 40) that appeared to be composed of two parallel filaments (Fig. 1F, left panel, see inset). The morphology of these septin structures is similar to that formed by recombinant septins and septin complexes purified from mammalian cells (9Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 25Sheffield P.J. Oliver C.J. Kremer B.E. Sheng S. Shao Z. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3483-3488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Mendoza M. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1858-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In FCF, SEPT2/6/7 formed much thicker filaments with an average diameter of 21.0 ± 1.1 nm (n = 40) that appear to comprise many parallel filaments (Fig. 1F, right panel, see inset). This change in septin assembly was confirmed by analyzing the ratio of septins in the supernatant and pellet after centrifugation at 16,000 × g. After dialysis in the presence of FCF, more SEPT2/6/7 was pelleted (∼90% versus ∼50%) (Fig. 1G). We also examined whether FCF has similar effects on the assembly of other filamentous cytoskeleton polymers such as actin and tubulin. In vitro actin and tubulin polymerization assays were performed in the presence of a range of FCF or DMSO concentrations. FCF did not affect the rate or steady state amount of actin or tubulin polymerization (Fig. 1, H and I). Taken together, these results show that FCF alters SEPT2/6/7 assembly and formation of higher-order structures in a dose-dependent manner. FCF did not affect actin or tubulin polymerization in vitro under the same conditions. FCF Alters Septin Organization in HeLa and MDCK Cells Reversibly—We next tested whether FCF affected septin organization in mammalian cells. HeLa cells were treated with increasing concentrations of FCF for 2 h and stained for SEPT2 (Fig. 2A). SEPT2 organization changed from thin, short fibrillar structures (Fig. 2A, arrow, see magnified image of the boxed region in the lower panel) to thick, long filamentous structures localized at the cell periphery (Fig. 2A, arrowhead, see magnified image of the boxed region in the lower panel). These effects were dose-dependent and pronounced at 50 μm FCF (Fig. 2A). To examine the time course of FCF effects, HeLa and MDCK cells were treated with 50 μm FCF and fixed after 1, 2, or 4 h. FCF began to induce the reorganization of septins after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 2B) with a concomitant increase in SEPT2 filament length and width (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Significantly, FCF-induced changes in septin organization were reversed upon FCF washout (2 h; Fig. 2C), demonstrating that the effects of FCF were not permanent and that septins were dynamic and could reorganize within 2 h. We also examined whether septins other than SEPT2 were affected by FCF and found that organization of SEPT7 was also affected during FCF treatment similar to that of SEPT2 (supplemental Fig. 2C). We observed that FCF-treated cells had elongated morphology (Fig. 2, A-C). We used the axis-length ratio (major axis length/minor axis length) to measure cell morphology (Fig. 2D). Quantification of the axis-length ratio of MDCK cells treated with FCF or DMSO revealed a time-dependent effect of FCF on cell morphology (Fig. 2D); this time course of changes in cell shape paralleled changes in septin organization observed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B). Live cell imaging of HeLa cells treated with FCF also showed gradual changes in cell morphology, which were reversed upon FCF washout (Fig. 2E, arrows, and see supplemental movies 1 and 2). Although the effects of FCF were reversible, indicating that cells were viable, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of FCF using trypan blue and alamarBlue assays. The trypan blue assay shows that the viability of HeLa and MDCK cells was unaffected even at FCF concentrations as high as 500 μm for 4 h (Fig. 2F). The alamarBlue assay indicates that after 24 h of treatment, FCF-treated HeLa cells were as viable as DMSO-treated cells at a concentration of FCF ≤ 62.5 μm. However, HeLa cells began to show decreasing viability at higher FCF concentrations (Fig. 2G). The results show that FCF is not toxic over short time periods even at high concentrations, and for long treatments, FCF is not toxic at a concentration of FCF ≤ 62.5 μm. FCF Dampens SEPT2 Dynamics—To explore how FCF acts on septins, we measured septin filament dynamics using FRAP in MDCK cells stably expressing SEPT2-YFP (18Spiliotis E.T. Kinoshita M. Nelson W.J. Science. 2005; 307: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). From the profile of fluorescence recovery, we calculated the mobile fraction and half-time of fluorescence recovery (t½) of SEPT2-YFP (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mobile fraction of SEPT2-YFP filaments was 66.6 ± 3.5% in the presence of DMSO when compared with 53.7 ± 5.1% in the presence of FCF (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table 1). The difference in the mobile fraction indicates that FCF increased the stable, immobile fraction of septin filaments. FCF treatment also resulted in a doubling of the half-time of fluorescence recovery (73.5 ± 4.5 s versus 38.9 ± 4.0 s, Fig. 3, A and B, Table 1, and supplemental movies 3 and 4). Since SEPT2-YFP dynamics reflect mainly the association and dissociation of septin complexes into filamentous structures (the recovery is much slower than free cytoplasmic diffusion), we derived the dissociation rate constant koff (koff = In2/t½) of SEPT2-YFP as described previously for FRAP analysis of cytoskeleton-binding proteins (44Bulinski J.C. Odde D.J. Howell B.J. Salmon T.D. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3885-3897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). SEPT2-YFP in FCF-treated cells had a koff of 9.8 ± 0.6 × 10-3 s-1 when compared with 14.8 ± 1.1 × 10-3 s-1 in DMSO-treated cells. This further suggests that FCF stabilizes septin compl"
https://openalex.org/W2008048656,"Background Estrogen is a pivotal regulator of cell proliferation in the normal breast and breast cancer. Endocrine therapies targeting the estrogen receptor are effective in breast cancer, but their success is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings With the goal of gaining mechanistic insights into estrogen action and endocrine resistance, we classified estrogen-regulated genes by function, and determined the relationship between functionally-related genesets and the response to tamoxifen in breast cancer patients. Estrogen-responsive genes were identified by transcript profiling of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Pathway analysis based on functional annotation of these estrogen-regulated genes identified gene signatures with known or predicted roles in cell cycle control, cell growth (i.e. ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis), cell death/survival signaling and transcriptional regulation. Since inducible expression of c-Myc in antiestrogen-arrested cells can recapitulate many of the effects of estrogen on molecular endpoints related to cell cycle progression, the estrogen-regulated genes that were also targets of c-Myc were identified using cells inducibly expressing c-Myc. Selected genes classified as estrogen and c-Myc targets displayed similar levels of regulation by estrogen and c-Myc and were not estrogen-regulated in the presence of siMyc. Genes regulated by c-Myc accounted for 50% of all acutely estrogen-regulated genes but comprised 85% (110/129 genes) in the cell growth signature. siRNA-mediated inhibition of c-Myc induction impaired estrogen regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, consistent with the prediction that estrogen regulates cell growth principally via c-Myc. The ‘cell cycle’, ‘cell growth’ and ‘cell death’ gene signatures each identified patients with an attenuated response in a cohort of 246 tamoxifen-treated patients. In multivariate analysis the cell death signature was predictive independent of the cell cycle and cell growth signatures. Conclusions/Significance These functionally-based gene signatures can stratify patients treated with tamoxifen into groups with differing outcome, and potentially identify distinct mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2026631621,"Background Identification of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) silenced by CpG methylation uncovers the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis and potential tumor biomarkers. Loss of heterozygosity at 11q25 is common in multiple tumors including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). OPCML, located at 11q25, is one of the downregulated genes we identified through digital expression subtraction. Methodology/Principal Findings Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed frequent OPCML silencing in NPC and other common tumors, with no homozygous deletion detected by multiplex differential DNA-PCR. Instead, promoter methylation of OPCML was frequently detected in multiple carcinoma cell lines (nasopharyngeal, esophageal, lung, gastric, colon, liver, breast, cervix, prostate), lymphoma cell lines (non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma, nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma) and primary tumors, but not in any non-tumor cell line and seldom weakly methylated in normal epithelial tissues. Pharmacological and genetic demethylation restored OPCML expression, indicating a direct epigenetic silencing. We further found that OPCML is stress-responsive, but this response is epigenetically impaired when its promoter becomes methylated. Ecotopic expression of OPCML led to significant inhibition of both anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of carcinoma cells with endogenous silencing. Conclusions/Significance Thus, through functional epigenetics, we identified OPCML as a broad tumor suppressor, which is frequently inactivated by methylation in multiple malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2011302772,"HIV-infected patients develop multiple metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, lipodystrophy and dyslipidemia. Although progression of these disorders has been associated with the use of various protease inhibitors and other antiretroviral drugs, HIV-infected individuals who have not received these treatments also develop lipid abnormalities albeit to a lesser extent. How HIV alters lipid metabolism in an infected cell and what molecular changes are affected through protein interaction pathways are not well-understood.Since many genetic, epigenetic, dietary and other factors influence lipid metabolism in vivo, we have chosen to study genome-wide changes in the proteomes of a human T-cell line before and after HIV infection in order to circumvent computational problems associated with multiple variables. Four separate experiments were conducted including one that compared 14 different time points over a period of >3 months. By subtractive analyses of protein profiles overtime, several hundred differentially expressed proteins were identified in HIV-infected cells by mass spectrometry and each protein was scrutinized for its biological functions by using various bioinformatics programs. Herein, we report 18 HIV-modulated proteins and their interaction pathways that enhance fatty acid synthesis, increase low density lipoproteins (triglycerides), dysregulate lipid transport, oxidize lipids, and alter cellular lipid metabolism.We conclude that HIV replication alone (i.e. without any influence of antiviral drugs, or other human genetic factors), can induce novel cellular enzymes and proteins that are significantly associated with biologically relevant processes involved in lipid synthesis, transport and metabolism (p = <0.0002-0.01). Translational and clinical studies on the newly discovered proteins may now shed light on how some of these proteins may be useful for early diagnosis of individuals who might be at high risk for developing lipid-related disorders. The target proteins could then be used for future studies in the development of inhibitors for preventing lipid-metabolic anomalies. This is the first direct evidence that HIV-modulates production of proteins that are significantly involved in disrupting the normal lipid-metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1987354436,"Increase in vascular permeability occurs under many physiological conditions such as wound repair, inflammation, and thrombotic reactions and is central in diverse human pathologies, including tumor-induced angiogenesis, ocular diseases, and septic shock. Thrombin is a pro-coagulant serine protease, which causes the local loss of endothelial barrier integrity thereby enabling the rapid extravasation of plasma proteins and the local formation of fibrin-containing clots. Available information suggests that thrombin induces endothelial permeability by promoting actomyosin contractility through the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. Here we took advantage of pharmacological inhibitors, knockdown approaches, and the emerging knowledge on how permeability factors affect endothelial junctions to investigate in detail the mechanism underlying thrombin-induced endothelial permeability. We show that thrombin signals through PAR-1 and its coupled G proteins Gα12/13 and Gα11/q to induce RhoA activation and intracellular calcium elevation, and that these events are interrelated. In turn, this leads to the stimulation of ROCK, which causes actin stress-fiber formation. However, this alone is not sufficient to account for thrombin-induced permeability. Instead, we found that protein kinase C-related kinase, a Rho-dependent serine/threonine kinase, is activated in endothelial cells upon thrombin stimulation and that its expression is required for endothelial permeability and the remodeling of cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesions. Our results demonstrate that the signal initiated by thrombin bifurcates at the level of RhoA to promote changes in the cytoskeletal architecture through ROCK, and the remodeling of focal adhesion components through protein kinase C-related kinase. Ultimately, both pathways converge to cause cell-cell junction disruption and provoke vascular leakage. Increase in vascular permeability occurs under many physiological conditions such as wound repair, inflammation, and thrombotic reactions and is central in diverse human pathologies, including tumor-induced angiogenesis, ocular diseases, and septic shock. Thrombin is a pro-coagulant serine protease, which causes the local loss of endothelial barrier integrity thereby enabling the rapid extravasation of plasma proteins and the local formation of fibrin-containing clots.

In turn, this leads to the stimulation of ROCK, which causes actin stress-fiber formation. However, this alone is not sufficient to account for thrombin-induced permeability. Instead, we found that protein kinase C-related kinase, a Rho-dependent serine/threonine kinase, is activated in endothelial cells upon thrombin stimulation and that its expression is required for endothelial permeability and the remodeling of cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesions. Our results demonstrate that the signal initiated by thrombin bifurcates at the level of RhoA to promote changes in the cytoskeletal architecture through ROCK, and the remodeling of focal adhesion components through protein kinase C-related kinase. Ultimately, both pathways converge to cause cell-cell junction disruption and provoke vascular leakage. Endothelial homeostasis and vascular integrity are tightly regulated during normal angiogenesis, wound repair, and thrombotic and inflammatory reactions (1Red-Horse K. Crawford Y. Shojaei F.

It is well known that endothelial exposure to thrombin stimulation induces rapid morphological and cytoskeletal changes, characterized by formation of actin stress fibers and endothelial gaps that could both be involved in the loss of endothelial barrier integrity (9Komarova, Y. A., Mehta, D., and Malik, A. B. (2007) Sci. STKE 2007, RE8Google Scholar).

In addition, ROCK, myosin light chain (MLC), and actin-regulating proteins participate in thrombin-triggered cytoskeletal reorganization and endothelial barrier disruption, most likely through the actomyosin contractility pathway (13Goeckeler Z.M.

Finally, RhoA activation may utilize downstream targets in addition to ROCK as, for example, some formin family proteins have been shown to contribute to thrombin-based endothelial cytoskeleton rearrangement (25Takeya R. Taniguchi K. Narumiya S. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate the thrombin-initiated molecular cascade leading to increased endothelial permeability using an siRNA-based knockdown approach for key signaling candidates. Here we show that thrombin uses a bipartite coupling from PAR-1 involving both Gα11/q and Gα12/13, which causes RhoA activation. The signal downstream from RhoA in turn bifurcates to stimulate two serine/threonine kinases, ROCK and PKC-related kinase (PRK). These RhoA downstream effectors then contribute to actomyosin cell contractility by regulating actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion organization, respectively. Finally, these pathways converge to promote the redistribution of endothelial cell-cell junctions, and the disruption of VE-cadherin adhesion by a mechanism distinct from that triggered by VEGF stimulation. These findings may help to dissect the molecular mechanisms deployed by thrombin causing the loss of endothelial barrier integrity, which may facilitate the future development of anti-permeability agents in thrombotic reactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfections—Immortalized human vascular endothelial cells were obtained as indicated in Ref. 27Edgell C.J.

Whereas blocking PAR-2, PAR-3, and PAR-4 only mildly affected thrombin-induced permeability, interfering with PAR-1 signaling dramatically reduced it to its basal level (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, inhibition of ERK activation was achieved only when multiple PAR antagonists were used, suggesting that although several PARs can independently control ERK activation in endothelial cells, PAR-1 may play a more prominent role in initiating signaling events culminating in endothelial barrier disruption (Fig. 1b). We then aimed at characterizing the Gα subunits responsible for the PAR-1-controlled permeability. Initially, by the use of pertussis toxin which impedes Gαi signaling (32Ui M. Katada T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar), we confirmed that thrombin-induced permeability was independent of Gαi, in contrast to IL-8, which acts through its cognate Gαi-coupled receptor, CXCR2 (Fig. 1c). To determine whether Gα12/13 or Gα11/q subunits are instead involved, we first utilized a molecular mutant approach, where dominant active forms were transfected in endothelial cells (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, the expression of activated forms of Gαq and Gα11 was sufficient to increase endothelial permeability in non-stimulated cells (Fig. 1e). However, all Gα12, Gα13, Gα11, and Gαq dominant active forms were able to potentiate thrombin-induced junctional permeability (Fig. 1f), suggesting a complex coupling of PAR receptors in the endothelial barrier function. Importantly, they did not alter the response to VEGF, a pro-permeability factor that acts through a tyrosine-kinase receptor (Fig. 1f). To understand better the specificity of PAR receptor signaling in endothelial permeability regulation, we next investigated the contribution of each Gα subunit by siRNA-based knockdown approaches (Fig. 1g). This revealed that Gα11 and Gαq were both required for thrombin to increase endothelial permeability, whereas Gα12 and Gα13 only partially affected the amplitude of the permeability response. Thus, our data suggest that thrombin can increase endothelial permeability mainly through PAR-1 coupled to Gα11/q, and to a lesser extent through Gα12/13.Gα11/q-induced Calcium Entry Is Required for Thrombin Signaling in Permeability—Gα11/q-coupled receptors can generally increase intracellular calcium concentrations, thus triggering multiple signaling pathways. Indeed, as reported previously, thrombin provoked a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 2a) (16Singh I. Knezevic N. Ahmmed G.U. Kini V. Malik A.B. Mehta D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7833-7843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This calcium wave was strictly dependent on the presence of Gα11/q, but not of Gα12/13, as judged by the calcium flux in cells in which specific Gα subunits were knocked down, alone or in combination (Fig. 2b). We thus explored the role of calcium entry in endothelial permeability. We first used different chemical inhibitors with distinct mode of action. BAPTA-AM, a general divalent ion chelator, reduced the increase of endothelial permeability upon thrombin stimulation but also in response to VEGF, suggesting a broad spectrum inhibition of essential calcium-dependent events (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, 2-ABP and TMB-8, two different compounds blocking calcium release from intracellular compartment storage (33Ueda S. Lee S.L. Fanburg B.L. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), did not modify endothelial permeability, whereas lanthanade and verapamil, which both affect extracellular Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane receptor-operated calcium channels (16Singh I. Knezevic N. Ahmmed G.U. Kini V. Malik A.B. Mehta D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7833-7843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), dramatically prevented thrombin-induced permeability (Fig. 1c). Thus, these data suggest that thrombin can trigger an increase in intracellular calcium concentration by the activation of receptor-operated calcium channels on endothelial cells, which is in turn necessary for the endothelial barrier control. As it is well described that the vascular permeability increase by thrombin is mediated by RhoA activation (9Komarova, Y. A., Mehta, D., and Malik, A. B. (2007) Sci. STKE 2007, RE8Google Scholar, 16Singh I. Knezevic N. Ahmmed G.U. Kini V. Malik A.B. Mehta D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7833-7843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we asked whether calcium increase and RhoA activity were linked. Interestingly, we first observed that in endothelial cells both Gα12/13 and Gα11/q protein subunit family contribute to RhoA activation by thrombin (Fig. 2d). Moreover, when the increase in intracellular calcium concentration was halted by the use of lanthanade or chelated by BAPTA-AM, thrombin-induced RhoA activation was barely detectable (Fig. 2e). Instead, 2-ABP, which affects storage-operated calcium, did not alter RhoA activation, in agreement with its lack of effect on endothelial permeability. In line with these results, MLC phosphorylation, a downstream target of RhoA, was similarly prevented by BAPTA-AM and lanthanade (Fig. 2e). Together, these findings suggest that thrombin stimulates Gα11/q to promote calcium entry, which in turn cooperates with Gα12/13 to stimulate RhoA activation and endothelial permeability.FIGURE 2Gα11/q-induced calcium entry is required for thrombin signaling in permeability. a, intracellular calcium concentration was measured by the Fluo4 probe in overnight starved 3-day-old endothelial monolayers and left unstimulated (buffer) or stimulated by ionomycin (1 μm), thrombin (0.1 unit/ml), and VEGF (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times. b, similar experiments were performed in nonsilencing (nsi) and Gα12/13, Gαq, Gα11, and Gαq/11 siRNA-treated cells. c, human endothelial cells were cultivated on collagen-coated 3-μm pore-size inserts for 3 days, starved overnight, and pretreated with the calcium chelator (25 μm BAPTA-AM), the inhibitors of storage-operated calcium (SOCinh) flux (75 μm 2-ABP and 100 μm TMB-8), and the inhibitors of receptor-operated calcium (ROCinh) flux (250 nm lanthanade and 500 nm verapamil) for 30 min prior to thrombin stimulation and permeability assays. d, human endothelial cells were transfected with nonsilencing RNA (nsi) or Gα12/13, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13/q/11 (all 4) siRNA for 5 days. Overnight starved cells were nonstimulated (–) or stimulated by thrombin and then subjected to RhoA pulldown assay to assess RhoA activation (RhoA-GTP). Western blots were performed in total cell lysates for the indicated G protein α subunits and RhoA. The level of RhoA-GTP was estimated on scanned membranes (Licor) and expressed as a normalized ratio on total RhoA. e, overnight starved 3-day-old endothelial cells were treated with 25 μm BAPTA-AM (Bapta), 75 μm 2-ABP, and 250 nm lanthanade (lantha) prior to thrombin stimulation.

First, we observed that the inhibition of RhoA activation by C3 toxin blocked thrombin-induced permeability, whereas VEGF function was not affected (Fig. 3a). In addition, the use of Y27632, a well characterized inhibitor of ROCK and PRK (34Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar), two serine/threonine kinases acting downstream of RhoA, hampered the thrombin-induced permeability response (Fig. 3a). The chemical inhibition of RhoA-dependent cytoskeletal contractility by ML7 and blebbistatin, which inhibit MLC kinase and myosin II, respectively, also prevented the increase in endothelial permeability caused by thrombin, although barely affecting the effect of VEGF (Fig. 3b). These observations are aligned with the role of cell contractility in endothelial permeability upon thrombin activity (9Komarova, Y. A., Mehta, D., and Malik, A. B. (2007) Sci. STKE 2007, RE8Google Scholar). To assess the specific contribution of ROCK and PRK in this RhoA-initiated contractility-dependent pathway, we decided to knock down PRK expression by the use of siRNA and to abolish ROCK activity by the expression of its dominant negative mutant (ROCK-KD). The latter was found to be a more effective approach to prevent ROCK function than knocking down ROCK, which was only limited using multiple siRNAs (not shown). As reported earlier, ROCK is required for thrombin-dependent permeability increase (Fig. 3c) (14Essler M. Amano M. Kruse H.J. Kaibuchi K. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21867-21874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that PRK is also necessary for this response, as siRNA extinction of PRK expression prevented thrombin-induced permeability (Fig. 3c). Thus, both RhoA downstream targets, ROCK and PRK, are required for the endothelial barrier destabilization caused by thrombin exposure.FIGURE 3ROCK and PRK are both required for thrombin-induced permeability. a and b, permeability assays were done in 3-day-old human endothelial cell starved overnight and pre-treated with C3 toxin (1 μg/ml) with tetanolysin (20 units) for 16 h, Y27632 (45 min, 5, 10, and 50 nm), blebbistatin (45 min, 5 μm), and ML-7 (45 min, 10 μm) prior VEGF and thrombin stimulation as described previously. c, human endothelial cells were electroporated with mock or Myc-tagged ROCK-KD mutant and cultured for 3 days on collagen-coated inserts. Overnight starved cells were then stimulated with thrombin and further analyzed for permeability. Expression level of ROCK-KD was checked by Western blot against Myc. d, similarly, cells were transfected with nonsilencing RNA (nsi, 3 days, 50 nm) or two independent sequences targeting PRK (si#1 and si#2, 3 days, 50 nm). Extinction efficiency was checked by Western blot for PRK, and tubulin was used as a loading control. All panels are representative of at least three independent experiments. Permeability assays were performed in each condition in nonstimulated (Ctrl), and VEGF and thrombin-stimulated cells.

Various reasons have been proposed to explain this phenomenon including increased human disturbance, pollution, or changes in coral reef biota that serve a major ecological function such as depletion of grazers. However, pinpointing the actual factors potentially responsible can be problematic. Here we show a phase shift from coral to the corallimorpharian Rhodactis howesii associated with a long line vessel that wrecked in 1991 on an isolated atoll (Palmyra) in the central Pacific Ocean. We documented high densities of R. howesii near the ship that progressively decreased with distance from the ship whereas R. howesii were rare to absent in other parts of the atoll. We also confirmed high densities of R. howesii around several buoys recently installed on the atoll in 2001. This is the first time that a phase shift on a coral reef has been unambiguously associated with man-made structures. This association was made, in part, because of the remoteness of Palmyra and its recent history of minimal human habitation or impact. Phase shifts can have long-term negative ramification for coral reefs, and eradication of organisms responsible for phase shifts in marine ecosystems can be difficult, particularly if such organisms cover a large area. The extensive R. howesii invasion and subsequent loss of coral reef habitat at Palmyra also highlights the importance of rapid removal of shipwrecks on corals reefs to mitigate the potential of reef overgrowth by invasives."
https://openalex.org/W2037930475,"Identifying biological pathways that vary across the age spectrum can provide insight into fundamental mechanisms that impact disease and frailty in the elderly. Few methodological approaches offer the means to explore this question on as broad a scale as gene expression profiling. Here, we have evaluated mRNA expression profiles as a function of age in two populations; one consisting of 191 individuals with ages-at-death ranging from 65-100 years and with post-mortem brain mRNA measurements of 13,216 genes and a second with 1240 individuals ages 15-94 and lymphocyte mRNA estimates for 18,519 genes.Among negatively correlated transcripts, an enrichment of mitochondrial genes was evident in both populations, providing a replication of previous studies indicating this as a common signature of aging. Sample differences were prominent, the most significant being a decrease in expression of genes involved in translation in lymphocytes and an increase in genes involved in transcription in brain, suggesting that apart from energy metabolism other basic cell processes are affected by age but in a tissue-specific manner. In assessing genomic architecture, intron/exon sequence length ratios were larger among negatively regulated genes in both samples, suggesting that a decrease in the expression of non-compact genes may also be a general effect of aging. Variance in gene expression itself has been theorized to change with age due to accumulation of somatic mutations and/or increasingly heterogeneous environmental exposures, but we found no evidence for such a trend here.Results affirm that deteriorating mitochondrial gene expression is a common theme in senescence, but also highlight novel pathways and features of gene architecture that may be important for understanding the molecular consequences of aging."
https://openalex.org/W2094025256,"Background To assess population persistence of species living in heterogeneous landscapes, the effects of habitat on reproduction and survival have to be investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a matrix population model to estimate habitat-specific population growth rates for a population of northern wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe breeding in farmland consisting of a mosaic of distinct habitat (land use) types. Based on extensive long-term data on reproduction and survival, habitats characterised by tall field layers (spring- and autumn-sown crop fields, ungrazed grasslands) displayed negative stochastic population growth rates (log λs: −0.332, −0.429, −0.168, respectively), that were markedly lower than growth rates of habitats characterised by permanently short field layers (pastures grazed by cattle or horses, and farmyards, log λs: −0.056, +0.081, −0.059). Although habitats differed with respect to reproductive performance, differences in habitat-specific population growth were largely due to differences in adult and first-year survival rates, as shown by a life table response experiment (LTRE). Conclusions/Significance Our results show that estimation of survival rates is important for realistic assessments of habitat quality. Results also indicate that grazed grasslands and farmyards may act as source habitats, whereas crop fields and ungrazed grasslands with tall field layers may act as sink habitats. We suggest that the strong decline of northern wheatears in Swedish farmland may be linked to the corresponding observed loss of high quality breeding habitat, i.e. grazed semi-natural grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2066707858,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the pathogen of Lyme disease, cycles in nature through Ixodes ticks and mammalian hosts. At least five Complement Regulator-Acquiring Surface Proteins (BbCRASPs) are produced by B. burgdorferi, which are thought to assist spirochetes in host immune evasion. Recent studies established that BbCRASP-2 is preferentially expressed in mammals, and elicits robust antibody response in infected hosts, including humans. We show that BbCRASP-2 is ubiquitously expressed in diverse murine tissues, but not in ticks, reinforcing a role of BbCRASP-2 in conferring B. burgdorferi defense against persistent host immune threats, such as complement. BbCRASP-2 immunization, however, fails to protect mice from B. burgdorferi infection and does not modify disease, as reflected by the development of arthritis. An infectious BbCRASP-2 mutant was generated, therefore, to examine the precise role of the gene product in spirochete infectivity. Similar to wild type B. burgdorferi, BbCRASP-2 mutants remain insensitive to complement-mediated killing in vitro, retain full murine infectivity and induce arthritis. Quantitative RT-PCR assessment indicates that survivability of BbCRASP-2-deficient B. burgdorferi is not due to altered expression of other BbCRASPs. Together, these results suggest that the function of a selectively expressed B. burgdorferi gene, BbCRASP-2, is not essential for complement resistance or infectivity in the murine host."
https://openalex.org/W2088571041,"The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates diverse processes of plant growth and development. It has recently been proposed that GCR2 functions as a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for ABA. However, the structural relationships and functionality of GCR2 have been challenged by several independent studies. A central question in this controversy is whether gcr2 mutants are insensitive to ABA, because gcr2 mutants were shown to display reduced sensitivity to ABA under one experimental condition (e.g. 22 degrees C, continuous white light with 150 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) but were shown to display wild-type sensitivity under another slightly different condition (e.g. 23 degrees C, 14/10 hr photoperiod with 120 micromol m(-2) s(-1)). It has been hypothesized that gcr2 appears only weakly insensitive to ABA because two other GCR2-like genes in Arabidopsis, GCL1 and GCL2, compensate for the loss of function of GCR2.In order to test this hypothesis, we isolated a putative loss-of-function allele of GCL2, and then generated all possible combinations of mutations in each member of the GCR2 gene family. We found that all double mutants, including gcr2 gcl1, gcr2 gcl2, gcl1 gcl2, as well as the gcr2 gcl1 gcl2 triple mutant displayed wild-type sensitivity to ABA in seed germination and early seedling development assays, demonstrating that the GCR2 gene family is not required for ABA responses in these processes.These results provide compelling genetic evidence that GCR2 is unlikely to act as a receptor for ABA in the context of either seed germination or early seedling development."
https://openalex.org/W2083463481,"The physiological function of the ubiquitous cellular prion protein, PrP(c), is still under debate. It was essentially studied in nervous system, but poorly investigated in epithelial cells. We previously reported that PrP(c) is targeted to cell-cell junctions of polarized epithelial cells, where it interacts with c-Src.We show here that, in cultured human enterocytes and in intestine in vivo, the mature PrP(c) is differentially targeted either to the nucleus in dividing cells or to cell-cell contacts in polarized/differentiated cells. By proteomic analysis, we demonstrate that the junctional PrP(c) interacts with cytoskeleton-associated proteins, such as gamma- and beta-actin, alpha-spectrin, annexin A2, and with the desmosome-associated proteins desmoglein, plakoglobin and desmoplakin. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed complexes associating PrP(c), desmoglein and c-Src in raft domains. Through siRNA strategy, we show that PrP(c) is necessary to complete the process of epithelial cell proliferation and for the sub-cellular distribution of proteins involved in cell architecture and junctions. Moreover, analysis of the architecture of the intestinal epithelium of PrP(c) knock-out mice revealed a net decrease in the size of desmosomal junctions and, without change in the amount of BrdU incorporation, a shortening of the length of intestinal villi.From these results, PrP(c) could be considered as a new partner involved in the balance between proliferation and polarization/differentiation in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093677656,"Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) induces a rise in blood oxygen-carrying capacity (CaO2) that unequivocally enhances maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) during exercise in normoxia, but not when exercise is carried out in severe acute hypoxia. This implies that there should be a threshold altitude at which V̇O2max is less dependent on CaO2. To ascertain which are the mechanisms explaining the interactions between hypoxia, CaO2 and V̇O2max we measured systemic and leg O2 transport and utilization during incremental exercise to exhaustion in normoxia and with different degrees of acute hypoxia in eight rhEpo-treated subjects. Following prolonged rhEpo treatment, the gain in systemic V̇O2max observed in normoxia (6–7%) persisted during mild hypoxia (8% at inspired O2 fraction (FIO2) of 0.173) and was even larger during moderate hypoxia (14–17% at FIO2 = 0.153–0.134). When hypoxia was further augmented to FIO2 = 0.115, there was no rhEpo-induced enhancement of systemic V̇O2max or peak leg V̇O2. The mechanism highlighted by our data is that besides its strong influence on CaO2, rhEpo was found to enhance leg V̇O2max in normoxia through a preferential redistribution of cardiac output toward the exercising legs, whereas this advantageous effect disappeared during severe hypoxia, leaving augmented CaO2 alone insufficient for improving peak leg O2 delivery and V̇O2. Finally, that V̇O2max was largely dependent on CaO2 during moderate hypoxia but became abruptly CaO2-independent by slightly increasing the severity of hypoxia could be an indirect evidence of the appearance of central fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2048914036,"Large-scale genome sequencing poses enormous problems to the logistics of laboratory work and data handling. When numerous fragments of different genomes are PCR amplified and sequenced in a laboratory, there is a high imminent risk of sample confusion. For genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which are free of natural recombination, single instances of sample mix-up involving different branches of the mtDNA phylogeny would give rise to reticulate patterns and should therefore be detectable.We have developed a strategy for comparing new complete mtDNA genomes, one by one, to a current skeleton of the worldwide mtDNA phylogeny. The mutations distinguishing the reference sequence from a putative recombinant sequence can then be allocated to two or more different branches of this phylogenetic skeleton. Thus, one would search for two (or three) near-matches in the total mtDNA database that together best explain the variation seen in the recombinants. The evolutionary pathway from the mtDNA tree connecting this pair together with the recombinant then generate a grid-like median network, from which one can read off the exchanged segments.We have applied this procedure to a large collection of complete human mtDNA sequences, where several recombinants could be distilled by our method. All these recombinant sequences were subsequently corrected by de novo experiments--fully concordant with the predictions from our data-analytical approach."
https://openalex.org/W2026657037,"Astrocytes usually respond to trauma, stroke, or neurodegeneration by undergoing cellular hypertrophy, yet, their response to a specific immune attack by T cells is poorly understood. Effector T cells establish specific contacts with target cells, known as immunological synapses, during clearance of virally infected cells from the brain. Immunological synapses mediate intercellular communication between T cells and target cells, both in vitro and in vivo. How target virally infected astrocytes respond to the formation of immunological synapses established by effector T cells is unknown.Herein we demonstrate that, as a consequence of T cell attack, infected astrocytes undergo dramatic morphological changes. From normally multipolar cells, they become unipolar, extending a major protrusion towards the immunological synapse formed by the effector T cells, and withdrawing most of their finer processes. Thus, target astrocytes become polarized towards the contacting T cells. The MTOC, the organizer of cell polarity, is localized to the base of the protrusion, and Golgi stacks are distributed throughout the protrusion, reaching distally towards the immunological synapse. Thus, rather than causing astrocyte hypertrophy, antiviral T cells cause a major structural reorganization of target virally infected astrocytes.Astrocyte polarization, as opposed to hypertrophy, in response to T cell attack may be due to T cells providing a very focused attack, and thus, astrocytes responding in a polarized manner. A similar polarization of Golgi stacks towards contacting T cells was also detected using an in vitro allogeneic model. Thus, different T cells are able to induce polarization of target astrocytes. Polarization of target astrocytes in response to immunological synapses may play an important role in regulating the outcome of the response of astrocytes to attacking effector T cells, whether during antiviral (e.g. infected during HIV, HTLV-1, HSV-1 or LCMV infection), anti-transplant, autoimmune, or anti-tumor immune responses in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1979910820,"Background SET and MYND domain (Smyd) proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of cellular proliferation and development in vertebrates. However, the in vivo functions and mechanisms by which these proteins act are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We have used biochemical and genetic approaches to study the role of a Smyd protein in Drosophila. We identified eleven Drosophila genes that encode Smyd proteins. CG14122 encodes a Smyd4 homologue that we have named dSmyd4. dSmyd4 repressed transcription and recruited class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). A region of dSmyd4 including the MYND domain interacted directly with ∼150 amino acids at the N-termini of dHDAC1 and dHDAC3. dSmyd4 interacts selectively with Ebi, a component of the dHDAC3/SMRTER co-repressor complex. During embryogenesis dSmyd4 was expressed throughout the mesoderm, with highest levels in the somatic musculature. Muscle-specific RNAi against dSmyd4 resulted in depletion of the protein and lead to severe lethality. Eclosion is the final moulting stage of Drosophila development when adult flies escape from the pupal case. 80% of dSmyd4 knockdown flies were not able to eclose, resulting in late pupal lethality. However, many aspects of eclosion were still able to occur normally, indicating that dSmyd4 is likely to be involved in the development or function of adult muscle. Conclusions/Significance Repression of transcription by dSmyd4 and the involvement of this protein in development suggests that aspects of Smyd protein function are conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2009490921,"The intracellular loops that interlink the four transmembrane domains of Ca2+- and Na+-channels (Cav, Nav) have critical roles in numerous forms of channel regulation. In particular, the intracellular loop that joins repeats I and II (I–II loop) in high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels possesses the binding site for Cavβ subunits and plays significant roles in channel function, including trafficking the α1 subunits of HVA channels to the plasma membrane and channel gating. Although there is considerable divergence in the primary sequence of the I–II loop of Cav1/Cav2 HVA channels and Cav3 LVA/T-type channels, evidence for a regulatory role of the I–II loop in T-channel function has recently emerged for Cav3.2 channels. In order to provide a comprehensive view of the role this intracellular region may play in the gating and surface expression in Cav3 channels, we have performed a structure-function analysis of the I–II loop in Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels using selective deletion mutants. Here we show the first 60 amino acids of the loop (post IS6) are involved in Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channel gating and kinetics, which establishes a conserved property of this locus for all Cav3 channels. In contrast to findings in Cav3.2, deletion of the central region of the I–II loop in Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 yielded a modest increase (+30%) and a reduction (−30%) in current density and surface expression, respectively. These experiments enrich our understanding of the structural determinants involved in Cav3 function by highlighting the unique role played by the intracellular I–II loop in Cav3.2 channel trafficking, and illustrating the prominent role of the gating brake in setting the slow and distinctive slow activation kinetics of Cav3.3."
https://openalex.org/W1973815843,"C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, is associated with risk of coronary events and sub-clinical measures of atherosclerosis. Evidence in support of this link being causal would include an association robust to adjustments for confounders (multivariable standard regression analysis) and the association of CRP gene polymorphisms with atherosclerosis (Mendelian randomization analysis).We genotyped 3 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [+1444T>C (rs1130864); +2303G>A (rs1205) and +4899T>G (rs 3093077)] in the CRP gene and assessed CRP and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a structural marker of atherosclerosis, in 4941 men and women aged 50-74 (mean 61) years (the Whitehall II Study). The 4 major haplotypes from the SNPs were consistently associated with CRP level, but not with other risk factors that might confound the association between CRP and CIMT. CRP, assessed both at mean age 49 and at mean age 61, was associated both with CIMT in age and sex adjusted standard regression analyses and with potential confounding factors. However, the association of CRP with CIMT attenuated to the null with adjustment for confounding factors in both prospective and cross-sectional analyses. When examined using genetic variants as the instrument for serum CRP, there was no inferred association between CRP and CIMT.Both multivariable standard regression analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis suggest that the association of CRP with carotid atheroma indexed by CIMT may not be causal."
https://openalex.org/W2002148007,"Fundamental for understanding the evolution of communication systems is both the variation in a signal and how this affects the behavior of receivers, as well as variation in preference functions of receivers, and how this affects the variability of the signal. However, individual differences in female preference functions and their proximate causation have rarely been studied.Calling songs of male field crickets represent secondary sexual characters and are subject to sexual selection by female choice. Following predictions from the ""matched filter hypothesis"" we studied the tuning of an identified interneuron in a field cricket, known for its function in phonotaxis, and correlated this with the preference of the same females in two-choice trials. Females vary in their neuronal frequency tuning, which strongly predicts the preference in a choice situation between two songs differing in carrier frequency. A second ""matched filter"" exists in directional hearing, where reliable cues for sound localization occur only in a narrow frequency range. There is a strong correlation between the directional tuning and the behavioural preference in no-choice tests. This second ""matched filter"" also varies widely in females, and surprisingly, differs on average by 400 Hz from the neuronal frequency tuning.Our findings on the mismatch of the two ""matched filters"" would suggest that the difference in these two filters appears to be caused by their evolutionary history, and the different trade-offs which exist between sound emission, transmission and detection, as well as directional hearing under specific ecological settings. The mismatched filter situation may ultimately explain the maintenance of considerable variation in the carrier frequency of the male signal despite stabilizing selection."
https://openalex.org/W2059874210,"Genome-wide association (GWA) studies identified a series of novel type 2 diabetes risk loci. Most of them were subsequently demonstrated to affect insulin secretion of pancreatic beta-cells. Very recently, a meta-analysis of GWA data revealed nine additional risk loci with still undefined roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Using our thoroughly phenotyped cohort of subjects at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, we assessed the association of the nine latest genetic variants with the predominant prediabetes traits, i.e., obesity, impaired insulin secretion, and insulin resistance.One thousand five hundred and seventy-eight metabolically characterized non-diabetic German subjects were genotyped for the reported candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) JAZF1 rs864745, CDC123/CAMK1D rs12779790, TSPAN8/LGR5 rs7961581, THADA rs7578597, ADAMTS9 rs4607103, NOTCH2 rs10923931, DCD rs1153188, VEGFA rs9472138, and BCL11A rs10490072. Insulin sensitivity was derived from fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Insulin secretion was estimated from OGTT data. After appropriate adjustment for confounding variables and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (corrected alpha-level: p = 0.0014), none of the SNPs was reliably associated with adiposity, insulin sensitivity, or insulin secretion (all p > or = 0.0117, dominant inheritance model). The risk alleles of ADAMTS9 SNP rs4607103 and VEGFA SNP rs9472138 tended to associate with more than one measure of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, respectively, but did not reach formal statistical significance. The study was sufficiently powered (1-beta = 0.8) to detect effect sizes of 0.19 < or = d < or = 0.25 (alpha = 0.0014) and 0.13 < or = d < or = 0.16 (alpha = 0.05).In contrast to the first series of GWA-derived type 2 diabetes candidate SNPs, we could not detect reliable associations of the novel risk loci with prediabetic phenotypes. Possible weak effects of ADAMTS9 SNP rs4607103 and VEGFA SNP rs9472138 on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, respectively, await further confirmation by larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W2060625180,"Synaptic activity in the central nervous system undergoes rapid state-dependent changes, requiring constant adaptation of the homeostasis between excitation and inhibition. The underlying mechanisms are, however, largely unclear. Chronic changes in network activity result in enhanced production of the inhibitory transmitter GABA, indicating that presynaptic GABA content is a variable parameter for homeostatic plasticity. Here we tested whether such changes in inhibitory transmitter content do also occur at the fast time scale required to ensure inhibition-excitation-homeostasis in dynamic cortical networks. We found that intense stimulation of afferent fibers in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices yielded a rapid and lasting increase in quantal size of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. This potentiation was mediated by the uptake of GABA and glutamate into presynaptic endings of inhibitory interneurons (the latter serving as precursor for the synthesis of GABA). Thus, enhanced release of inhibitory and excitatory transmitters from active networks leads to enhanced presynaptic GABA content. Thereby, inhibitory efficacy follows local neuronal activity, constituting a negative feedback loop and providing a mechanism for rapid homeostatic scaling in cortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2094663320,"Glut4 storage vesicles (GSVs) represent translocation-competent vesicular carriers in fat and skeletal muscle cells that deliver Glut4 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation. GSVs include three major cargo proteins: Glut4, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP), and sortilin. Previous work has suggested that the lumenal interaction between Glut4 and sortilin and the cytoplasmic interaction between sortilin and GGA adaptors play an important role in recruitment of Glut4 into the GSVs. However, the mechanism of IRAP targeting to this compartment remains unknown. To address this question, we show that in differentiating adipocytes IRAP enters the GSVs from the “donor” membranes on day 3 of differentiation. Forced expression of sortilin in undifferentiated cells does not recruit IRAP into the vesicles. However, double expression of sortilin and Glut4 reconstitutes functional GSVs that incorporate endogenous IRAP. To explain this process, we show by a yeast two-hybrid system and chemical cross-linking that the lumenal domain of IRAP can interact with the lumenal loop of Glut4. IRAP without the lumenal domain is faithfully targeted to the donor membranes but has significantly lower insulin responsiveness than full-length IRAP.

Chem. 2007; 282: 9008-9016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and with GGA adaptors via the cytoplasmic tail (18Li L.V. Kandror K.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2145-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, sortilin may work as a transmembrane scaffold that couples Glut4 to the cytoplasmic GGA-mediated vesicle budding machinery. However, the mechanism of IRAP targeting to the GSVs remains unknown and is addressed in this study. We used the developmental approach and analyzed GSV biogenesis in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Undifferentiated cells express IRAP (21Ross S.A. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas sortilin and Glut4 are induced around day 3 of differentiation (13Morris N.J. Ross S.A. Lane W.S. Moestrup S.K.

Investig. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We have found that in 3T3-L1 cells IRAP is localized in the perinuclear syntaxin 6-positive compartment throughout the differentiation process. IRAP is targeted to this compartment by the cytoplasmic tail. Interestingly, the biochemical nature of IRAP-containing compartment changes dramatically during cell differentiation. In undifferentiated 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, IRAP is predominantly localized in heavy membranes that are readily pelleted by low speed centrifugation. Upon cell differentiation, IRAP is re-distributed from the heavy membranes into small vesicles, the GSVs. This transition takes place on day 3 of differentiation, in tandem with the induction of sortilin and Glut4. Sortilin ectopically expressed in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells is targeted to small vesicles but has only a minor effect on the recruitment of endogenous IRAP to this compartment. However, double expression of sortilin and Glut4 in undifferentiated cells leads to formation of functional GSVs (14Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which as we now show, incorporate endogenous IRAP. Thus, in the process of cell differentiation, sortilin recruits Glut4 into the GSVs, and Glut4 recruits IRAP. To gain insight into the potential mechanism of the latter event, we have determined that the lumenal domain of IRAP interacts with the lumenal loop of Glut4 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Moreover, in 3T3-L1 cells, IRAP can be cross-linked to Glut4 with the help of the membrane-permeable reagent DSP. These results suggest that IRAP and Glut4 may directly interact via lumenal domains. To test the importance of the lumenal domain in IRAP targeting, we have replaced it with the V5 tag. This reporter protein maintains the perinuclear localization in the cell but has significantly lower insulin responsiveness. Thus, protein-protein interactions in the vesicular lumen may play an essential role in protein sorting to and self-assembly of the GSVs. Antibodies—The monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen, the monoclonal anti-Myc tag antibody and the polyclonal anti-Myc tag antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), and the monoclonal anti-syntaxin 6 and anti-sortilin (neurotensin receptor 3) antibodies were from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. The monoclonal anti-Glut4 antibody 1F8 (23James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against cellugyrin (24Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were described previously. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against IRAP was a kind gift from Dr. Paul Pilch, Boston University School of Medicine. cDNA Constructs—The pLenti6/V5 Directional TOPO cloning kit was purchased from Invitrogen. Two oligonucleotides (5′-CACCGAATTCGTTTAAACTGTCGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACAGTTTAAACGAATTCGGTG-3′) were annealed and ligated to the pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO vector. This modified vector was named pLenti vector. The other two oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCGTTAACGAATTCTCGCTCGAGCCAGTGTGGTGGTGTTTAAACCTGCAGACTAGTGTCGACAGGGGCCCGC-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCCTGTCGACACTAGTCTGCAGGTTTAAACACCACCACACTGGCTCGAGCGAGAATTCGTTAACG-3′) were annealed and ligated to the BamHI- and SacII-cut pLenti vector. This vector was named pLenti-m3. EYFP was amplified using pEYFP-N1 (a kind gift from Dr. Carmela Abraham, Boston University School of Medicine) as a template and two primers, 5′-ACGACGTCAGGATCCGTCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAA-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTCTGGAATTCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′. The PCR product was cut by BamHI and EcoRI and ligated to the correspondingly cut pLenti-m3 vector. The resulting vector was named pLenti-m3-EYFP-C1. Alternatively, EYFP was amplified with the primers 5′-ACGACGACAGTCGACATCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGAGTCTGCCGCGGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′. The PCR product was digested sequentially by SalI and SacII and ligated into pLenti-m3 to obtain pLenti-m3-EYFP-N3. Rat IRAP cDNA in the pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector was a kind gift from Dr. Susanna R. Keller (University of Virginia). Full-length IRAP was amplified using two primers, 5′-ACGACGTCACTCGAGAGCTTGGGGCGCTGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTACGACTAGTCAGCCACAGTGTCAGAGTTT-3′. This PCR product (with no stop codon) was digested by XhoI and SpeI and ligated in-frame into the pLenti-m3-EYFP-C1 vector to obtain pLenti-m3-EYFP-IRAP-V5. The IRAP truncation construct (IRAPtail) comprised of the residual five amino acids in the luminal domain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail was made by the PCR reaction using two primers, 5′-ACGACGTCACTCGAGAGCTTGGGGCGCTGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTACGACTAGTAAAGGTACATCTAGGCAGTAG-3′. The PCR product was digested by XhoI and SpeI and ligated into the pLenti-m3-EYFP-C1 vector to obtain pLenti-m3-EYFP-IRAPtail-V5. ECFP was amplified using two primers, 5′-TCGAGTCTGGAATTCGTCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAA-3′ and 5′-ACGACGTCAGTCGACTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into the EcoRI- and SalI-cut pBabe-puro vector to obtain the pBabe-ECFP vector. myc7-Glut4 was amplified using two primers, 5′-ACGACGTCAGGATCCGCCGCCACCATGCCGTCGGGTTTCCAGCA-3′ and 5′-ACGACGTCAGAATTCGTCATTCTCATCTGGCCCTAAA-3′. The myc7-Glut4 cDNA was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the pBabe-ECFP to obtain pBabe-myc7-Glut4-ECFP. Stable Cell Lines—3T3-L1 cells stably transfected with mLNCX2-sortilin-myc/His (S cells) as well as 3T3-L1 double-transfected with pBabe-myc7-Glut4 and mLNCX2-sortilin-myc/His (GS cells) were described previously (14Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cells stably transfected with pBabe-myc7-Glut4-ECFP were obtained the same way as G cells. pBabe-myc7-Glut4-ECFP-expressing and wild type 3T3-L1 cells were infected with pLenti-m3-EYFP-N1, pLenti-m3-EYFP-IRAP-V5, and pLenti-m3-EYFP-IRAPtail-V5 according to the Invitrogen protocol. Selection of cells was performed with blasticidin (8 μg/ml) for 2 weeks, and pooled clones were analyzed. All cells were cultured, differentiated, and maintained as described previously (25Stephens J.M. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation of 3T3-L1 Cells—Before harvesting, cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed 3 times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium heated to 37 °C and incubated in the same media for 3 h. Where indicated, cells were treated with 100 nm insulin or carrier (5 μm HCl) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 5 or 15 min at 37 °C. After that, cells were washed three times with HES buffer with protease inhibitors (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 1 μm aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 37 °C. Cells were harvested in the same buffer and homogenized by 10 strokes up and down using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. Alternatively, cells were homogenized with 11 strokes through the ball-bearing cell cracker (Isobiotec) with a 12-μm clearance. In some experiments total homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Supernatant of this centrifugation (or total homogenate) was centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Plasma membrane, heavy microsomes, light microsomes, and nuclear/mitochondria fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation as described previously (26Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Fractions were re-suspended in HES buffer, and protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—For velocity gradient centrifugation, light microsomes samples (0.2 ml, 500 μg) were loaded onto a 3.8-ml linear 10-30% (w/v) sucrose gradient in HE buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH7.4) and centrifuged for 65 min in a Sorvall TST60.4 rotor (Kendro Laboratory Products, Asheville, NC) at 48,000 rpm. Each gradient was separated into 17-25 fractions starting from the bottom of the tube. The protein profile was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce), and the linearity of the gradients was confirmed by measuring the refractive index of fractions. The fractions were further analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Immunofluorescence—3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were grown in 60-mm dishes. The night before the experiment cells were reseeded onto Nunc LAB-TEK II 4-well chamber slides. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown and differentiated in 60-mm dishes. On day 5 of differentiation, cells were lifted up by trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C and reseeded to 4-well chamber slides. After growing on chamber slides for two more days, adipocytes were used for experiments. Differentiated and undifferentiated cells were washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium heated to 37 °C and incubated in the same media for 3 h. Then, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Fixed cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with PBS with 5% donkey serum and 5% bovine serum albumin and stained with anti-syntaxin 6 monoclonal antibody and Cy3-conjugated donkey antimouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Incubation with each antibody lasted for 60 min at room temperature and was followed by six quick washes with PBS. A SlowFade-Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes) was used for mounting cells on slides that were examined with the help of Axiovert 200 m fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Pictures were taken using the Axio-vision 3.0 program (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Quantification of images was performed with the help of NIH image analysis software packages, Image J (Version 1.37a) using co-localization threshold plug-in (developed by the Wright Cell Imaging Facility, Toronto, Canada). Zero-zero pixels were included in the threshold calculation. For every data point, at least five different fields were analyzed. Fluorescence-assisted Cell Sorting—Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed as described previously (27Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, 3T3-L1 cells were grown on 6-well dishes. Before the experiment, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for at least 3 h, and insulin (100 nm) was administered for 15 min. After that, cells were quickly cooled to 4 °C and washed with cold PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBS2+). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with the anti-V5 antibody or nonspecific mouse IgG (1:500) in PBS2+ containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% donkey serum (1 ml/well) for 1.5 h and washed twice with PBS2+ for 5 min each time. Cells were then incubated with 5 μg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey F(ab)2 anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS2+ and additionally washed 3 times with PBS2+ for 10 min each wash. Cells were gently scraped in 1 ml of regular PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum (calcium and magnesium were excluded at this stage to decrease cell adhesion). Alternatively, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin and 0.5 mg/ml collagenase in PBS at 37 °C for 5-10 min until most cells detached from the plate (28Bose A. Cherniack A.D. Langille S.E. Nicoloro S.M. Buxton J.M. Park J.G. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5262-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Detached cells were washed once by centrifugation at 300 × g for 4 min and re-suspended in 1 ml of PBS. Immediately before sorting, cells were passed through a 40-μm filter. All flow cytometric data were acquired using equipment maintained by the Boston University Medical Campus Flow Cytometry Core Facility using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Appropriate compensation between FL1 and FL2 channels was adjusted using wild type 3T3-L1 cells, EYFP-expressing cells, and control V5-expressing cells stained with anti-V5 primary antibody and phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. In each sample, 200,000 cells were counted. Specific phycoerythrin fluorescent signal was determined by subtracting the signal from transfected cells treated under the same conditions as the experimental group and stained with nonspecific IgG and phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. Specific YFP signal was determined by subtracting background fluorescent signal from non-transfected 3T3-L1 cells. Mean fluorescent intensities were used for quantification. In Vitro Reconstitution of IRAP-containing Vesicles—Cytosol and the donor membranes were isolated from undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, and the assay was performed as described earlier (24Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The vesicle fraction along with the donor fraction were analyzed by Western blotting. The yield of small vesicles was linear when the heavy membrane fraction was used at a concentration of 0.2-1.6 mg/ml. To compare different experiments, we use arbitrary units defined as (intensity of the IRAP signal in the vesicle fraction - intensity in the “no cytosol” control lane) × (volume of the vesicle fraction)/(intensity of the IRAP signal in the donor fraction) × (volume of the donor fraction). The average of duplicate reactions and the deviation is plotted on the graph. Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—Cross-linking was performed according to Nielsen et al. (29Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8832-8836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were washed twice with PBS and once with KRP buffer (12.5 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4), and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was added to final concentration 2 mm for 30 min at room temperature. Then quenching buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μm aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) was added for 15 min at 4 °C followed by 2 washes with the same buffer. The cells were lysed in 500 μl of quenching buffer with 1% Triton X-100, and cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. This material (1.5 mg) was incubated with the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and nonspecific mouse IgG (2 μg each) along with 30 μl of protein G beads overnight at 4 °C with rotating. The beads were then washed 3 times with 1% Triton X-100 in quenching buffer. Elution was carried out with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The MATCHMAKER Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) was used for these experiments. The IRAP luminal domain without added tag (IRAP LD) was amplified using two primers, 5′-ACGACGTCACATATGCCTAGATGTACCTTTACCAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGACAAGGGATCCCTACAGCCACAGTGTCAGAG-3′. The PCR product was digested by NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the correspondingly cut pGBKT7 vector that encodes the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DNA BD) to obtain pGBKT7-IRAP LD. The first extracellular loop of Glut4 without tag was amplified using two primers, 5′-CTAGACCTGGAATTCAATGCCCCTCAGAAGGTGATT-3′ and 5′-ACGACGTCAGGATCCCCCAGAGGGTGGTGAGGGTG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into the pGADT7 vector that encodes GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD) to obtain pGADT7-Loop1. Transformation was done according to the manufacturer's manual. Aliquots of co-transformants (100 μl) were plated on SD/-Leu/-Trp, SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp, SD/-Leu/-Trp/X-α-Gal, and SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp plates. Growth was checked after 4 days at 30 °C. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from wild type 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and GS fibroblasts (three 100-mm dishes per each sample) using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was removed from the RNA samples with the help of TURBO DNA-free (Ambion). RNA samples (1 μg each) were reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). The resulting cDNA samples were diluted 1:10, and diluted samples (9 μl) were analyzed in triplicate by the TaqMan gene expression assays with 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled IRAP probe (Applied Biosystems, assay ID Mm00555903_m1) or VIC-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Applied Biosystems, assay ID 4352339E). Quantitative real time PCR was performed in 384-well plates with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT sequence detection system. Data were analyzed with the help of SDS software v2.2 (Applied Biosystems). The level of IRAP mRNA (normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA) in wild type 3T3-L1 fibroblasts was set at 1. The relative amount of IRAP mRNA in GS cells was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli with and without reducing agents and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. After transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37°C. The blots were probed with specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Kodak Image Station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Co.). The signals were quantified using the Kodak 1D image analysis software. EYFP-conjugated IRAP and ECFP-tagged myc7-Glut4 (Fig. 1) were stably expressed in 3T3-L1 cells. Fig. 2A demonstrates that in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes both proteins are predominantly localized in the syntaxin 6-positive perinuclear compartment. Treatment of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes with insulin does not induce noticeable changes in the intracellular localization of IRAP and, in particular, does not cause its marked translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). In differentiated adipocytes, IRAP-EYFP also shows a significant co-localization with syntaxin 6 in the perinuclear compartment (see also Ref. 30Hou J.C. Suzuki N. Pessin J.E. Watson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33457-33466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) where it overlaps with myc7-Glut4-ECFP (Fig. 2C). However, with differentiation, IRAP-EYFP gains insulin responsiveness and is clearly translocated to the plasma membrane upon insulin stimulation (Figs. 2D). Previously, we have shown that insulin responsiveness of ectopically expressed Glut4 also dramatically increases with differentiation (14Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Intracellular localization and insulin responsiveness of IRAP in 3T3-L1 cells. A and C, undifferentiated (A) and differentiated (C) 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing IRAP-EYFP and myc7-Glut4-ECFP were stained with syntaxin 6 monoclonal antibody and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG. B and D, undifferentiated (B) and differentiated (D) 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing IRAP-EYFP were treated with 100 nm insulin or carrier (5 μm HCl) for 15 min at 37 °C and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although immunofluorescence staining does not show significant differentiation-induced differences in the intracellular localization of IRAP (Fig. 2), the biochemical fractionation reveals a dramatic change in the subcellular distribution of this protein upon cell differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1973139750,"Many animals communicate by marking focal elements of their home range with different kinds of materials. Visual signaling has been demonstrated to play a previously unrecognized role in the intraspecific communication of eagle owls (Bubo bubo), in both territorial and parent-offspring contexts. Visual signals may play a role in a variety of circumstances in this crepuscular and nocturnal species.Here, we report that a large amount of extremely visible white faeces and prey feathers appear during the breeding season on posts and plucking sites in proximity to the nest, potentially representing a way for eagle owls to mark their territory. We present descriptive and experimental evidence showing that faeces and prey remains could act as previously unrecognized visual signals in a nocturnal avian predator. This novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls' current reproductive status to potential intruders, such as other territorial owls or non-breeding floaters. Faeces and prey feather markings may also advertise an owl's reproductive status or function in mate-mate communication.We speculate that faeces marks and plucking may represent an overlooked but widespread method for communicating current reproduction to conspecifics. Such marking behavior may be common in birds, and we may now be exploring other questions and mechanisms in territoriality."
https://openalex.org/W2037248072,"It is normally thought that deep corolla tubes evolve when a plant's successful reproduction is contingent on having a corolla tube longer than the tongue of the flower's pollinators, and that pollinators evolve ever-longer tongues because individuals with longer tongues can obtain more nectar from flowers. A recent model shows that, in the presence of pollinators with long and short tongues that experience resource competition, coexisting plant species can diverge in corolla-tube depth, because this increases the proportion of pollen grains that lands on co-specific flowers.We have extended the model to study whether resource competition can trigger the co-evolution of tongue length and corolla-tube depth. Starting with two plant and two pollinator species, all of them having the same distribution of tongue length or corolla-tube depth, we show that variability in corolla-tube depth leads to divergence in tongue length, provided that increasing tongue length is not equally costly for both species. Once the two pollinator species differ in tongue length, divergence in corolla-tube depth between the two plant species ensues.Co-evolution between tongue length and corolla-tube depth is a robust outcome of the model, obtained for a wide range of parameter values, but it requires that tongue elongation is substantially easier for one pollinator species than for the other, that pollinators follow a near-optimal foraging strategy, that pollinators experience competition for resources and that plants experience pollination limitation."
https://openalex.org/W2083611225,"Foci of tick-borne pathogens occur at fine spatial scales, and depend upon a complex arrangement of factors involving climate, host abundance and landscape composition. It has been proposed that the presence of hosts that support tick feeding but not pathogen multiplication may dilute the transmission of the pathogen. However, models need to consider the spatial component to adequately explain how hosts, ticks and pathogens are distributed into the landscape. In this study, a novel, lattice-derived, behavior-based, spatially-explicit model was developed to test how changes in the assumed perception of different landscape elements affect the outcome of the connectivity between patches and therefore the dilution effect. The objective of this study was to explain changes in the exposure rate (ER) of red deer to Anaplasma spp. under different configurations of suitable habitat and landscape fragmentation in the presence of variable densities of the potentially diluting host, wild boar. The model showed that the increase in habitat fragmentation had a deep impact on Habitat Sharing Ratio (HSR), a parameter describing the amount of habitat shared by red deer and wild boar, weighted by the probability of the animals to remain together in the same patch (according to movement rules), the density of ticks and the density of animals at a given vegetation patch, and decreased the dilution effect of wild boar on deer Anaplasma ER. The model was validated with data collected on deer, wild boar and tick densities, climate, landscape composition, host vegetation preferences and deer seropositivity to Anaplasma spp. (as a measure of ER) in 10 study sites in Spain. However, although conditions were appropriate for a dilution effect, empirical results did not show a decrease in deer ER in sites with high wild boar densities. The model showed that the HSR was the most effective parameter to explain the absence of the dilution effect. These results suggest that host habitat usage may weaken the predicted dilution effect for tick-borne pathogens and emphasize the importance of the perceptual capabilities of different hosts in different landscapes and habitat fragmentation conditions for predictions of dilution effects."
https://openalex.org/W2156962213,"Hybrid dysfunctions, such as sterility, may result in part from disruptions in the regulation of gene expression. Studies of hybrids within the Drosophila simulans clade have reported genes expressed above or below the expression observed in their parent species, and such misexpression is associated with male sterility in multigenerational backcross hybrids. However, these studies often examined whole bodies rather than testes or had limited replication using less-sensitive but global techniques. Here, we use a new RNA isolation technique to re-examine hybrid gene expression disruptions in both testes and whole bodies from single Drosophila males by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. We find two early-spermatogenesis transcripts are underexpressed in hybrid whole-bodies but not in assays of testes alone, while two late-spermatogenesis transcripts seem to be underexpressed in both whole-bodies and testes alone. Although the number of transcripts surveyed is limited, these results provide some support for a previous hypothesis that the spermatogenesis pathway in these sterile hybrids may be disrupted sometime after the expression of the early meiotic arrest genes."
https://openalex.org/W2036397533,"Background Little information exists regarding the burden of HIV among tuberculosis patients in India, and no population-based surveys have been previously reported. A community-based HIV prevalence survey was conducted among tuberculosis patients treated by the national tuberculosis control programme to evaluate the HIV prevalence among tuberculosis patients in India. Methodology/Principal Findings Fifteen districts (total population: 40.2 million) across 8 states were stratified by HIV prevalence in antenatal clinic HIV surveillance sites and randomly selected. From December 2006 to May 2007, remnant serum was collected from patients' clinical specimens taken after 2 months of anti-tuberculosis treatment and subjected to anonymous, unlinked HIV testing. Specimens were obtained and successfully tested for 5,995 (73%) of 8,217 tuberculosis patients eligible for the survey. HIV prevalence ranged widely among the 15 surveyed districts, from 1% in Koch Bihar, West Bengal, to 13.8% in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. HIV infection was 1.3 times more likely among male TB patients than among female patients. Relative to smear-positive tuberculosis, HIV infection was 1.4 times more likely among smear-negative patients and 1.3 times more likely among extrapulmonary patients. In 4 higher-HIV prevalence districts, which had been previously surveyed in 2005–2006, no significant change in HIV prevalence was detected. Conclusions The burden of HIV among tuberculosis patients varies widely in India. Programme efforts to implement comprehensive TB-HIV services should be targeted to areas with the highest HIV burden. Surveillance through routine reporting or special surveys is necessary to detect areas requiring intensification of TB-HIV collaborative activities."
https://openalex.org/W2070706948,"Background The neostriatum, the mouse homologue of the primate caudate/putamen, is the input nucleus for the basal ganglia, receiving both cortical and dopaminergic input to each of its sub-compartments, the striosomes and matrix. The coordinated activation of corticostriatal pathways is considered vital for motor and cognitive abilities, yet the mechanisms which underlie the generation of these circuits are unknown. The early and specific targeting of striatal subcompartments by both corticostriatal and nigrostriatal terminals suggests activity-independent mechanisms, such as axon guidance cues, may play a role in this process. Candidates include the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) family of glycoproteins which have roles not only in axon guidance, but also in the maturation and stability of neural circuits where they are expressed in lattice-like perineuronal nets (PNNs). Methodology/Principal Findings The expression of CSPG-associated structures and PNNs with respect to neostriatal subcompartments has been examined qualitatively and quantitatively using double-labelling for Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), and the μ-opioid receptor (μOR), a marker for striosomes, at six postnatal ages in mice. We find that at the earliest ages (postnatal day (P)4 and P10), WFA-positive clusters overlap preferentially with the striosome compartment. By P14, these clusters disappear. In contrast, PNNs were first seen at P10 and continued to increase in density and spread throughout the caudate/putamen with maturation. Remarkably, the PNNs overlap almost exclusively with the neostriatal matrix. Conclusions/Significance This is the first description of a reversal in the distribution of CSPG associated structures, as well as the emergence and maintenance of PNNs in specific subcompartments of the neostriatum. These results suggest diverse roles for CSPGs in the formation of functional corticostriatal and nigrostriatal connectivity within the striosome and matrix compartments of the developing caudate/putamen."
https://openalex.org/W2055871852,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) interacts with selectins to support leukocyte rolling along vascular wall. L- and P-selectin bind to N-terminal tyrosine sulfate residues and to core-2 O-glycans attached to Thr-57, whereas tyrosine sulfation is not required for E-selectin binding. PSGL-1 extracellular domain contains decameric repeats, which extend L- and P-selectin binding sites far above the plasma membrane. We hypothesized that decamers may play a role in regulating PSGL-1 interactions with selectins. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild-type PSGL-1 or PSGL-1 molecules exhibiting deletion or substitution of decamers with the tandem repeats of platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha were compared in their ability to roll on selectins and to bind soluble L- or P-selectin. Deletion of decamers abrogated soluble L-selectin binding and cell rolling on L-selectin, whereas their substitution partially reversed these diminutions. P-selectin-dependent interactions with PSGL-1 were less affected by decamer deletion. Videomicroscopy analysis showed that decamers are required to stabilize L-selectin-dependent rolling. Importantly, adhesion assays performed on recombinant decamers demonstrated that they directly bind to E-selectin and promote slow rolling. Our results indicate that the role of decamers is to extend PSGL-1 N terminus far above the cell surface to support and stabilize leukocyte rolling on L- or P-selectin. In addition, they function as a cell adhesion receptor, which supports approximately 80% of E-selectin-dependent rolling."
https://openalex.org/W2033152806,"A comprehensive gene collection for S. oneidensis was constructed using the lambda recombinase (Gateway) cloning system. A total of 3584 individual ORFs (85%) have been successfully cloned into the entry plasmids. To validate the use of the clone set, three sets of ORFs were examined within three different destination vectors constructed in this study. Success rates for heterologous protein expression of S. oneidensis His- or His/GST-tagged proteins in E. coli were approximately 70%. The ArcA and NarP transcription factor proteins were tested in an in vitro binding assay to demonstrate that functional proteins can be successfully produced using the clone set. Further functional validation of the clone set was obtained from phage display experiments in which a phage encoding thioredoxin was successfully isolated from a pool of 80 different clones after three rounds of biopanning using immobilized anti-thioredoxin antibody as a target. This clone set complements existing genomic (e.g., whole-genome microarray) and other proteomic tools (e.g., mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis), and facilitates a wide variety of integrated studies, including protein expression, purification, and functional analyses of proteins both in vivo and in vitro."

A novel isoform of GC-A has been identified that is the result of differential splicing of exon 4. The deletion of a 51-bp sequence is predicted to delete 17 amino acids (Lys314–Gln330) in the membrane-distal part of the extracellular domain.

Furthermore, cotransfection studies showed that this GC-A variant forms heterodimers with the wild type receptor and inhibits ligand-inducible cGMP generation. Finally, treatment of mice with angiotensin II (300 ng/kg/min during 7 days) resulted in enhanced pulmonary mRNA expression of spliced GC-A, which was concomitant to diminished GC-A/cGMP responses to ANP.

The NP/GC-A system has a critical role in the endocrine regulation of arterial blood pressure and volume and in the local counter-regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. In mice, genetic ablation of ANP or GC-A both resulted in severe arterial hypertension, hypervolemia, and cardiac hypertrophy (2John S.W. Krege J.H. Oliver P.M. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Pang S.C.

Apart from these genetic variations, functional alterations of ANP or GC-A might also be involved in cardiovascular diseases. Hence, blunted vasodilating, diuretic/natriuretic, and cGMP responses to exogenous ANP have been reported in essential hypertension (7Bulut D. Potthast R. Hanefeld C. Schulz T. Kuhn M. Mügge A. Eur.

The latter patients exhibit a severe neurohumoral imbalance, which is characterized by elevated plasma levels of ANP and BNP, and an activated renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, among others (9Burnett Jr., J.C.

Many studies have shown that exposure of GC-A to high concentrations of ANP/BNP or to growth hormones such as angiotensin II (Ang II) or endothelin can lead to homologous versus heterologous desensitization of the receptor (Refs. 11Arise K.K.

Based on observations in vitro, in GC-A-overexpressing HEK 293 cells, this desensitization has been attributed to inactivating post-translational modifications of GC-A, in particular to dephosphorylation of the receptor within its intracellular domain (12Bryan P.M. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16041-16047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Fan D. Bryan P.M. Antos L.K. Potthast R.J. Potter L.R. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, whether this process fully accounts for the inhibition of the ANP/GC-A system observed in vivo remains to be determined. The basic topology of GC-A consists of an ∼450-amino acid extracellular ligand-binding domain, a 21-residue hydrophobic membrane-spanning region, and a 566-amino acid intracellular domain (reviewed in Refs. 1Kuhn M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The latter can be further divided into a juxtamembrane region of ∼250 amino acids that is similar to known serine/threonine protein kinases, a 41-amino acid amphipathic cooled-coil hinge region, and an ∼250-amino acid C-terminal guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain. In the absence of ligand, GC-A exists as a homodimer or homotetramer, and ANP binding does not lead to further aggregation (1Kuhn M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Multiple domains that are located both outside and inside the plasma membrane mediate the oligomerization of GC-A. The intracellular dimerization interface region has been mapped to the amphipathic sequence that bisects the kinase homology and cyclase domains (1Kuhn M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this study we describe the presence of a GC-A splice variant, predicted to delete 17 amino acids (ΔLys314–Gln330) in the membrane-distal part of the extracellular domain. This splice variant has unique structural properties that impede ligand binding and ligand-induced guanylyl cyclase activity. RT-PCR analyses revealed that mRNA for this splice variant is ubiquiously expressed, although at ∼10-fold lower levels as compared with wild type GC-A. We also demonstrate that splice GC-A can form heterodimers with wild type GC-A thereby interfering with ANP signaling. Finally, our in vivo studies indicate that enhanced alternative splicing of GC-A might be one of the mechanisms leading to diminished activity of the endogenous ANP/GC-A system in response to angiotensin II. Animals—Mouse F1 hybrids between 129/Sv and C57BL/6 strains were used for tissue collection to isolate genomic DNA, RNA, and protein and for angiotensin II treatment protocols (see below). The experiments were conducted in accordance with the German legislation on protection of animals and the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health Publication 85-23 revised 1985). They were approved by the local governmental animal care committee. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Total RNA was isolated from various tissues with TRIzol reagent as recommended by the supplier. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using 200 units of SuperScript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers. One microliter of cDNA pool was subjected to PCR with two specific primers flanking the alternatively spliced region: forward, 5′-AGACGATGGGCAGGATAGGAGAGC-3′; reverse, 5′ CCAGAGGGAGAAATCAGTGTC-3′ (the lengths of PCR products was 352 bp for wild type GC-A and 301 bp for GC-AΔ314–330). Forty seven cycles (including first 12 touchdown cycles of the PCR) were suitable for a comparative quantification of mRNA encoding wild type GC-A and the splice variant from each tissue. Aliquots (20 μl) of reaction mixture were electrophoresed in a 3% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Thereafter, the samples were analyzed by Southern blot with the specific probe 5′-TCAGTGTCCCGATCTCCATTT-3′, complementary to exon 5 of the murine GC-A gene. Modeling of the Splicing Variant GC-AΔ314–330—The extracellular domain dimer of the splicing variant was modeled using the structure of the rat GC-A ectodomain (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 1DP4) and the ANP-peptide receptor dimeric assembly used for generation of receptor dimers as an additional guide (PDB accession number 1YK1). The peptide segment from Lys314 to Gln330, which is missing in the splice variant, was removed manually in the structure template resulting in an almost complete loss of helix α10. The open ends were connected in the model by two different ways. In the first setup the amide of Leu313 and the carbonyl of Ala331 were connected such that helix α9 running from Pro288 to Phe305 fills in the place that is freed by the loss of α-helix 10 in the splice variant. In the second setup the α-helix 9 was kept in place and the distant ends were connected via an extended structure formed by residues Ala331 to Gln338, which are part of the α-helix 10 and are not deleted by the alternative splicing. For both alternative models, structures were refined using the software Quanta2006 and Charmm. The membrane-proximal part, which is distant from the location of the deletion, was kept fixed. For the membrane-distal part in close proximity of ΔLys314–Gln330, several rounds of energy minimization and molecular dynamic simulations were performed. Only geometrical terms were used; electrostatic terms were excluded. Identical simulations were performed for wild type GC-A and both alternative models of the splicing variant GC-AΔLys314-Gln330 to allow for comparison. First only side chain atoms were refined with the protein backbone kept fixed. Subsequently, the protein backbone of the membrane-distal part (residues Ser1 to Gly127 and Glu284 to Asp373) was also refined by stepwise removing positional harmonic constraints. The final models exhibit good backbone geometries. The putative receptor dimer assembly was obtained by fitting the models onto the human GC-A receptor dimer bound to the ANP peptide ligand (PDB entry 1YK1). Assaying Wild Type and Spliced GC-A Activity in Transfected HEK 293 Cells—The splice mutation in GC-A (GC-AΔLys314-Gln330) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the wild type rat GC-A expression construct pCMV5-GC-A (kind gift from Dr. L.R. Potter, Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis). To measure ligand inducibility of the cyclase activity, HEK 293 cells were seeded to 40–45% confluency in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected 2 days later with 0.2 μg/well of expression construct with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Transfected cells were serum-starved for 4 h prior to ANP exposure (48 h after transfection). Cells were pretreated with 0.1 mm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 15 min and then exposed to various concentrations of ANP (rat ANP, Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) for another 10 min. Intracellular cGMP was measured by radioimmunoassay (16Schreier B. Börner S. Völker K. Gambaryan S. Schäfer S.C. Kuhlencordt P. Gassner B. Kuhn M. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 4193-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additionally, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to monitor in real time the kinetics and extent of cGMP formation in intact HEK 293 cells cotransfected with GC-A (wild type or splice form) and the cGMP indicator (pGES-DE2 (17Nikolaev V.O. Gambaryan S. Lohse M.J. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)). Binding Assay—HEK 293 cells expressing GC-A or GC-AΔLys314-Gln330 were washed with serum-free medium and incubated in DMEM for 20 min at 37 °C with 100 pm 125I-ANP (∼100,000 cpm/well; specific activity, 904 Ci/mmol; Bachem) and various concentrations of unlabeled ANP. The cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and then solubilized in 500 μl of 1 m NaOH, and radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. Cell Fractionation and Biotinylation—For fractionated extraction of the cytosolic, membrane, and nuclear proteins of GC-A-overexpressing HEK 293 cells, a cell fractionation kit was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions (nano-TOOLS Antikörpertechnik, Teningen, Germany). For biotin-labeling experiments, HEK 293 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection and incubated in 1 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany) for 30 min at 4 °C (18Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1022-C1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Biotin-conjugated cell surface proteins were purified with streptavidin-agarose (Perbio Science) (18Mei Z.Z. Mao H.J. Jiang L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1022-C1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified protein complexes were denatured and analyzed by Western blotting as described below for coimmunoprecipitation protein samples. Coexpression of Wild Type and Spliced GC-A, Coimmunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analyses—For expression of FLAG-tagged wild type GC-A, the expression construct pCMV5-FLAG-GC-A was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Chinkers (Department of Pharmacology, University of South Alabama, Mobile). For epitope tagging of the splice variant, the HA (YPYDVP-DYA) epitope was positioned immediately after the cleavage site of the signal peptide of GC-AΔLys314-Gln330 by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. HEK 293 cells were prepared in 10-cm dishes and (co)transfected with 10 μg of plasmid as described above. After 48 h, the cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of lysis buffer (see above). After centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was mixed with 20 μl of pre-equilibrated anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads (Sigma) and agitated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times, resuspended in 40 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue), and boiled for 5 min. For Western blot analyses, protein samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (16Schreier B. Börner S. Völker K. Gambaryan S. Schäfer S.C. Kuhlencordt P. Gassner B. Kuhn M. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 4193-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Antibodies were against GC-A (generated in our laboratory), anti-FLAG (Sigma), or anti-HA (COVANCE, Hiss Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany). Chronic Treatment of Mice with Exogenous Angiotensin II—Mice (10 males, 10–12 weeks old) received Ang II (Sigma) at a dose of 300 ng/kg/min during 1 week. The peptide was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl and 0.01 m acetic acid and then infused subcutaneously via osmotic minipumps (model 2002; Alzet, Colorado City, CO). For comparison, their littermates were only given vehicle. Mice were sacrificed under urethane anesthesia, and the lungs were bisected and frozen in liquid nitrogen (for RNA and protein extraction). Expression and Activity of GC-A in Murine Tissues—Murine lungs were homogenized with a microdismembrator in homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol, supplemented with a mixture of protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma)). The membrane fraction was collected after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. GC-A expression was determined by Western blot analyses. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as reference protein (antibody from Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) (19Kilic A. Velic A. De Windt L.J. Fabritz L. Voss M. Mitko D. Zwiener M. Baba H.A. van Eickels M. Schlatter E. Kuhn M. Circulation. 2005; 112: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ANP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity was determined as described (20Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To initiate cyclase activity, 50 μg of membrane protein was incubated in assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, 30 mm phosphocreatine, 400 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (185 units/mg) and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C, with or without ANP. At 10 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold 100% (v/v) ethanol (final concentration 70%). After centrifugation (3000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), the supernatants were dried in a speed vacuum concentrator, resuspended in sodium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0) and acetylated, and the cGMP content was determined by radioimmunoassay (20Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). cGMP content was normalized to protein content. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—A quantitative analysis of GC-A and spliced GC-A mRNA expression was performed using the LightCycler 480 detection system (Roche Applied Science) (21Potthast R. Ehler E. Scheving L.A. Sindic A. Schlatter E. Kuhn M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3087-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The sequences and positions of oligonucleotide primers and fluorogenic probes (TaqMan probes, all designed by TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany) are depicted in Fig. 1, A and B. The wild type-specific probe labeled with FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein-HX) and BlackBerry quencher binds to 16 bases of the deleted sequence, whereas the 3′-part of the deletion-specific probe with a YAK reporter dye binds to the region 5′ of the deletion (see Fig. 1B). Data were calculated using the absolute quantification/second derivative max method (Roche Applied Science LightCycler 480 software), which calculates DNA concentration by interpolation with a standard curve generated by using known amounts of the target DNA (21Potthast R. Ehler E. Scheving L.A. Sindic A. Schlatter E. Kuhn M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3087-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Reaction was performed in 20 μl of mixture, containing Roche Applied Science probe master mix (catalog number 04887301001), 200 nm of each primer, and 100 nm FAM or YAK (Epoch Yakima Yellow)-labeled TaqMan probe. Wild type GC-A and GC-AΔLys314-Gln330 transcripts were normalized to the Mus musculus cytochrome c1 mRNA. Data Analysis—Statistical comparisons were evaluated using Student's t test (p < 0.05). Data are given as means ± S.E. mRNA Encoding GC-AΔLys314–Gln330 Is Expressed in All Murine Organs—As an approach to study the regulation of the activity of the natriuretic peptide system, we characterized the gene sequence of the GC-A gene coding for the extracellular domain of the GC-A receptor. Nucleotide sequence analyses of PCR products amplified from mouse kidney identified a novel isoform of GC-A mRNA. This isoform results from the deletion of a 51-bp sequence in exon 4, generated by splicing a cryptic donor site to the normal acceptor site (Fig. 1) (22Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar). This alternative splicing is predicted to delete 17 amino acids (ΔLys314-Gln330) in the membrane-distal part of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of GC-A (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 2, GC-A isoform expression was detected by RT-PCR in all murine tissues examined such as ovary, spleen, brain, testes, heart, lung, kidney, aorta, as well as smaller resistance arteries such as the renal interlobar artery. The ratio of splice to wild type GC-A mRNA levels was less than 10% in all studied tissues (Fig. 2). Because total tissue RNA was used, we do not know whether this splice isoform of the GC-A gene is highly expressed in a limited number of cells or is expressed at low levels throughout these organs. This differentiation will be an important goal for our future studies. Isoforms of the mammalian GC-A receptor generated by alternative splicing have been described in two previous studies. mRNA encoding an isoform resulting from differential splicing of a new exon 5a (a 9-bp sequence predicted to add three amino acids to the extracellular yuxtamembrane region of GC-A) was found to be expressed mainly in renal papilla and adrenal gland (23Tallerico-Melnyk T. Watt V.M. Yip C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Another mRNA isoform lacking exon 9 (which encodes a fragment of the regulatory kinase-like domain of GC-A) was found to be ubiquitously expressed at very low levels (less than 1% of total GC-A transcripts) (24Francoeur F. Gossard F. Hamet P. Tremblay J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22: S172-S174Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). None of these studies investigated the potential biological function of the variant. This was our question for the following investigations. GC-AΔLys314-Gln330 Lacks ANP Binding and ANP-induced Guanylyl Cyclase Activity—Alternative splicing is common in vertebrates (5% of genes (25Sharp P.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar)) and is a useful mechanism for generating cell surface receptor isoforms with distinct functions (26Breitbart R.E. Andreadis A. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 467-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). First, to obtain insights into the molecular mechanism, by which the loss of the residues Lys314 to Gln330 would influence receptor activation, we performed molecular modeling of the extracellular domain of the splicing variant. The crystal structure of rat GC-A ectodomain (PDB entry 1DP4) was used as a template, in which the residues Lys314 to Gln330 forming a major part of α-helix 10 in the membrane-distal part were removed (Fig. 3). Because the deletion is rather far off the peptide-ligand-binding site (located in the membrane-proximal part), a direct influence on ligand binding seemed unlikely. However, the membrane-distal part is involved in receptor dimer formation and possibly constrains the receptor dimer in a receptor- and signaling-competent conformation (27van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28van den Akker F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 923-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29McNicoll N. Gagnon J. Rondeau J.J. Ong H. DeLean A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12950-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Ogawa H. Qiu Y. Ogata C.M. Misono K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28625-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding the GC-A receptor is activated by a ligand-dependent rotation of both extracellular receptor monomer subunits (27van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Ogawa H. Qiu Y. Ogata C.M. Misono K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28625-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus ligand binding and receptor activation are highly dependent on the proper formation of the preformed receptor dimer. The helix α10, which is almost completely removed upon alternative splicing, is located at the back of this dimerization interface. Because α-helix 10 is almost completely hidden in the hydrophobic core, loss of the helix should result in larger structural alterations (Fig. 3). Deletion of helix α10 would remove a number of hydrophobic residues, e.g. Ile316, Ile317, Phe321, Leu327, and Tyr328 that pack tightly against the central β-sheet of β-strands 1, 3, and 4. These strands are important for the structural maintenance of the dimerization interface formed by the helices 2 and 3. Thus loss of Lys314 to Gln330 might alter the dimerization properties of the GC-A ectodomain and thereby lead to inactivation of the receptor. The modeling indeed showed that the differences in the hydrophobic core propagate to the helices 2 and 3 at the dimerization epitope. In comparison with the wild type starting structure, the helix angle of helix α2 is altered with the N-terminal half of the helix moving away from the dimerization interface by almost 2 Å. This movement is coupled to a dislocation of the β-strands 1 and 3, which itself is a consequence of the changed packing in the hydrophobic core of the splicing variant. Because a defined conformation of the preformed receptor dimer is probably indispensable for ANP binding, an altered conformation of receptor extracellular domain assembly of this pre-existing receptor dimer as suggested from modeling could alter ANP binding and/or signaling. We tested the function of GC-AΔLys314-Gln330 by transfecting HEK 293 cells and measuring cGMP production under baseline conditions and after stimulation with ANP. Transfection with cDNA encoding splice GC-A produced equivalent amounts of protein by Western blot, compared with the wild type (see inset in Fig. 4A). Basal cGMP levels of cells expressing spliced GC-A were similar to those of cells expressing wild type GC-A. In the latter, intracellular cGMP levels were increased by ANP in a concentration-dependent manner, up to a 400-fold increase in cGMP in response to 100 nm ANP (Fig. 4A). ANP failed to elevate cyclic GMP concentrations in HEK 293 cells expressing splice GC-A (Fig. 4A). Additionally, FRET was used to monitor in real time the kinetics and extent of cGMP formation in single intact cells. HEK cells coexpressing the wild type GC-A receptor and a monomolecular FRET biosensor (pGES-DE2 (17Nikolaev V.O. Gambaryan S. Lohse M.J. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)) exhibited a rapid and sustained increase in FRET upon stimulation with ANP (Fig. 4B). As described previously, pGES-DE2 responds to cGMP binding with a robust increase in FRET (17Nikolaev V.O. Gambaryan S. Lohse M.J. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can conclude that ANP elicited robust elevations in [cGMP]i via wild type GC-A receptors, whereas these responses were totally absent in cells expressing the splice variant. The same results were obtained for BNP as the second specific GC-A ligand (not shown). Finally, the transfectants were assayed for their 125I-ANP binding activity. In mock-transfected cells, negligible binding was observed. Competition experiments with unlabeled ANP or BNP showed that wild type GC-A, transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, specifically bound 125I-ANP (Fig. 4C). In cells transfected with the splice variant, no specific binding was observed (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that alternative splicing results in a GC-A variant that lacks ANP/BNP binding and NP-induced guanylyl cyclase activity. As described above, modeling suggested that mainly the membranedistal part of the ANP-receptor extracellular domain is affected by the deletion. However, the subsequent structural changes in the dimerization domain apparently provoke conformational changes in the preformed dimer which in turn prevent ANP binding. Alternative Splicing Does Not Affect Membrane Localization of GC-A—The loss of GC-A function as a result of alternative splicing could be attributed to defects in either protein expression or protein trafficking or both. To investigate these possibilities, we performed Western blot analysis after cell fractionation as well as after cell surface biotin-labeling experiments with transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. Cell fractionation showed that there were no obvious differences in the subcellular expression levels of wild type or mutant GC-A (Fig. 5A). Both the wild type and spliced form were predominantly located at the plasma membrane of HEK 293 cells. Additionally, a smaller amount of both proteins was detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 5A). GC-A was absent in the nuclear fraction. In addition, the biotin-labeling experiments indicated that the levels of biotinylated GC-A protein at the plasma membrane were similar for wild type and mutant (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results suggest that the deletion of positions ΔLys314–Gln330 did not significantly alter the protein expression or the membrane localization, and therefore it does not account for the loss of ANP binding and GC-A activity. GC-AΔLys314-Gln330 Forms Heterodimers with Wild Type GC-A and Inhibits the Responsiveness of GC-A to ANP—Although the transmembrane GC-A receptor contains a single cyclase catalytic site per polypeptide chain, receptor dimerization is essential for the activation of the catalytic domain (31Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Yang R.B. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13738-13742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The introduction of mutations in individual subunits could therefore lead to the formation of nonfunctional dimers. To address this possibility, we coexpressed FLAG-tagged wild type with HA-tagged spliced GC-A in HEK 293 cells and performed coimmunoprecipitation. The same number of cells was transfected with the same amount of plasmids, and molar ratios of plasmid pairs were kept at 1:1. As shown in Fig. 5C, coexpression did not change the expression levels of either the FLAG-tagged wild type or HA-tagged mutant proteins (top). The amount of HA-tagged mutant GC-A, pulled down with the coexpressed FLAG-tagged wild type GC-A, using an anti-FLAG antibody, was similar (Fig. 5C, bottom). Taken together, these results indicate that splice GC-A is able to form heterodimers with wild type GC-A. Fig. 5D shows the functional impact of this interaction. The base-line intracellular cGMP levels of HEK 293 cells cotransfected with FLAG-GC-A and pCMV5 (mock) were similar to the levels of cells cotransfected with FLAG-GC-A and HA-splice GC-A. However, the inclusion of the splice variant resulted in much lower cGMP responses to ANP (Fig. 5D). Hence, although the variant receptor lacks ANP/BNP binding and guanylyl cyclase activity, it may be involved in the natriuretic peptide signaling system, for example as a negative regulator. Treatment of Mice with Angiotensin II Diminishes GC-A Activity and Increases Expression of Splice GC-A—Finally, to elucidate whether increased alternative splicing of GC-A could participate in the negative regulation of the NP/GC-A system by Ang II in vivo, we examined the expression and activity of GC-A in lungs from control mice, and from mice infused with a subpressor dose of Ang II (300 ng/kg/min, n = 10) during 7 days. The expression of total GC-A protein was not altered by Ang II (Fig. 6A). Unfortunately, these immunoblot analyses did not discriminate between the protein expression levels of wild type GC-A (∼130 kDa) and the splice variant (∼128 kDa). To characterize the responsiveness of GC-A, membrane-bound ANP-dependent cGMP production was assayed. As shown in Fig. 6B, ANP-stimulated cGMP synthesis in lung membranes obtained from Ang II-treated mice was significantly blunted. Finally, we used real time RT-PCR to quantify the mRNA ratio for GC-AΔLys314-Gln330 versus wild type GC-A using probes unique for each (as depicted in Fig. 1, A and B). Notably, the ratio of splice versus wild type GC-A mRNA expression was significantly increased in the lungs of Ang II-treated mice as compared with untreated mice (Fig. 6C). Given that the splice variant serves as a dominant negative form, Ang II-induced alternative splicing of GC-A may represent a novel mechanism for reducing the sensitivity of the wild type receptor to ANP and BNP. Our future studies will be directed to further characterize the specific regulation of alternative GC-A splicing and the possible (patho)physiological implications for the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. This type of regulation has been shown previously for soluble GC (receptor for nitric oxide) and for guanylyl cyclase B (the receptor for C-type natriuretic peptide) (33Behrends S. Harteneck C.

Thus, the guanylyl cyclase family, in general, may utilize such dominant negative isoforms as regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2030594771,"Background The transcriptome of the cerebral cortex is remarkably homogeneous, with variations being stronger between individuals than between areas. It is thought that due to the presence of many distinct cell types, differences within one cell population will be averaged with the noise from others. Studies of sorted cells expressing the same transgene have shown that cell populations can be distinguished according to their transcriptional profile. Methodology We have prepared a low-redundancy set of 16,209 full-length cDNA clones which represents the transcriptome of the mouse visual cortex in its coding and non-coding aspects. Using an independent tag-based approach, CAGE, we confirmed the cortical expression of 72% of the clones. Clones were amplified by PCR and spotted on glass slides, and we interrogated the microarrays with RNA from flow-sorted fluorescent cells from the cerebral cortex of parvalbumin-egfp transgenic mice. Conclusions We provide an annotated cDNA clone collection which is particularly suitable for transcriptomic analysis in the mouse brain. Spotting it on microarrays, we compared the transcriptome of EGFP positive and negative cells in a parvalbumin-egfp transgenic background and showed that more than 30% of clones are differentially expressed. Our clone collection will be a useful resource for the study of the transcriptome of single cell types in the cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2060503202,"The concept of reverse engineering a gene network, i.e., of inferring a genome-wide graph of putative gene-gene interactions from compendia of high throughput microarray data has been extensively used in the last few years to deduce/integrate/validate various types of ""physical"" networks of interactions among genes or gene products.This paper gives a comprehensive overview of which of these networks emerge significantly when reverse engineering large collections of gene expression data for two model organisms, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, without any prior information. For the first organism the pattern of co-expression is shown to reflect in fine detail both the operonal structure of the DNA and the regulatory effects exerted by the gene products when co-participating in a protein complex. For the second organism we find that direct transcriptional control (e.g., transcription factor-binding site interactions) has little statistical significance in comparison to the other regulatory mechanisms (such as co-sharing a protein complex, co-localization on a metabolic pathway or compartment), which are however resolved at a lower level of detail than in E. coli.The gene co-expression patterns deduced from compendia of profiling experiments tend to unveil functional categories that are mainly associated to stable bindings rather than transient interactions. The inference power of this systematic analysis is substantially reduced when passing from E. coli to S. cerevisiae. This extensive analysis provides a way to describe the different complexity between the two organisms and discusses the critical limitations affecting this type of methodologies."
https://openalex.org/W2040500331,"As more and more research efforts have been attracted to dynamic or differential proteomics, a method with high temporal resolution and high throughput is required. In present study, a (35)S in vivo Labeling Analysis for Dynamic Proteomics (SiLAD) was designed and tested by analyzing the dynamic proteome changes in the highly synchronized A549 cells, as well as in the rat liver 2/3 partial hepatectomy surgery. The results validated that SiLAD technique, in combination with 2-Dimensional Electrophoresis, provided a highly sensitivity method to illustrate the non-disturbed endogenous proteins dynamic changes with a good temporal resolution and high signal/noise ratio. A significant number of differential proteins can be discovered or re-categorized by this technique. Another unique feature of SiLAD is its capability of quantifying the rate of protein expression, which reflects the cellular physiological turn points more effectively. Finally, the prescribed SiLAD proteome snapshot pattern could be potentially used as an exclusive symbol for characterizing each stage in well regulated biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2059963180,"Phenotypic diversity and fidelity can be balanced by controlling stochastic molecular mechanisms. Epigenetic silencing is one that has a critical role in stress response. Here we show that in yeast, incomplete silencing increases stochastic noise in gene expression, probably owing to unstable chromatin structure. Telomere position effect is suggested as one mechanism. Expression diversity in a population achieved in this way may render a subset of cells to readily respond to various acute stresses. By contrast, strong silencing tends to suppress noisy expression of genes, in particular those involved in life cycle control. In this regime, chromatin may act as a noise filter for precisely regulated responses to environmental signals that induce huge phenotypic changes such as a cell fate transition. These results propose modulation of chromatin stability as an important determinant of environmental adaptation and cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2103687425,Background Initiation of chromosome replication in E. coli requires the DnaA and DnaC proteins and conditionally-lethal dnaA and dnaC mutants are often used to synchronize cell populations. Methodology/Principal Findings DNA microarrays were used to measure mRNA steady-state levels in initiation-deficient dnaA46 and dnaC2 bacteria at permissive and non-permissive temperatures and their expression profiles were compared to MG1655 wildtype cells. For both mutants there was altered expression of genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis at the non-permissive temperature. Transcription of the dnaA and dnaC genes was increased at the non-permissive temperature in the respective mutant strains indicating auto-regulation of both genes. Induction of the SOS regulon was observed in dnaC2 cells at 38°C and 42°C. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that dnaC2 mutant cells at non-permissive temperature had completed the early stages of chromosome replication initiation. Conclusion/Significance We suggest that in dnaC2 cells the SOS response is triggered by persistent open-complex formation at oriC and/or by arrested forks that require DnaC for replication restart.
https://openalex.org/W2095164621,"Viruses induce signaling and host defense during infection. Employing these natural trigger mechanisms to combat organ or tissue failure is hampered by harmful effects of most viruses. Here we demonstrate that SV40 empty capsids (Virus Like Particles-VLPs), with no DNA, induce host Hsp/c70 and Akt-1 survival pathways, key players in cellular survival mechanisms. We postulated that this signaling might protect against organ damage in vivo. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was chosen as target. AKI is critical, prevalent disorder in humans, caused by nephrotoxic agents, sepsis or ischemia, via apoptosis/necrosis of renal tubular cells, with high morbidity and mortality. Systemic administration of VLPs activated Akt-1 and upregulated Hsp/c70 in vivo. Experiments in mercury-induced AKI mouse model demonstrated that apoptosis, oxidative stress and toxic renal failure were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with capsids prior to the mercury insult. Survival rate increased from 12% to >60%, with wide dose response. This study demonstrates that SV40 VLPs, devoid of DNA, may potentially be used as prophylactic agent for AKI. We anticipate that these finding may be projected to a wide range of organ failure, using empty capsids of SV40 as well as other viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2044132032,"Narcolepsy is a severe sleep disorder that is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexies and a tendency towards obesity. Recent discoveries indicate that the major pathophysiology is a loss of hypocretin (orexin) producing neurons due to immunologically mediated degeneration. Visfatin is a recently described proinflammatory adipokine. It is identical to the immune modulating pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF). Our study examines the hypothesis that visfatin levels are altered in narcoleptic patients.For the analysis, a total of n = 54 patients (n = 18 males and n = 36 females) with the diagnosis of narcolepsy according to DSM-IV and the International Classification of Sleep Disorders were examined (BMI mean 30.3+/-5.5, age mean 52.5+/-16.1 years). As a control group 39 unrelated (n = 12 males and n = 27 females) healthy volunteers with no sleep disorder according to DSM-IV were included (BMI mean 28.5+/-4.6, age mean 51.1+/-13.6 years). Peripheral visfatin levels were measured using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit with a measurement range from 0.1-1000 ng/ml. Narcolepsy symptoms, severity and frequency of symptoms as well as the total duration of various aspects of the symptomatology were assessed by unstructured and structured clinical interviews in including the Stanford Center for Narcolepsy Sleep Inventory.Circulating visfatin was found to be significantly increased in HLA DR2 positive narcoleptic patients compared to controls.Taken together, our results add to the evidence of disturbed immunological regulation in patients with narcolepsy."
