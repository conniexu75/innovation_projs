https://openalex.org/W4221136070,"Ultra-scaled transistors are of interest in the development of next-generation electronic devices1-3. Although atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) transistors have been reported4, the fabrication of devices with gate lengths below 1 nm has been challenging5. Here we demonstrate side-wall MoS2 transistors with an atomically thin channel and a physical gate length of sub-1 nm using the edge of a graphene layer as the gate electrode. The approach uses large-area graphene and MoS2 films grown by chemical vapour deposition for the fabrication of side-wall transistors on a 2-inch wafer. These devices have On/Off ratios up to 1.02 × 105 and subthreshold swing values down to 117 mV dec-1. Simulation results indicate that the MoS2 side-wall effective channel length approaches 0.34 nm in the On state and 4.54 nm in the Off state. This work can promote Moore's law of the scaling down of transistors for next-generation electronics."
https://openalex.org/W4220706180,"Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) imaging sensors allow machines to perceive, map and interact with the surrounding world 1 . The size of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) devices is often limited by mechanical scanners. Focal plane array-based 3D sensors are promising candidates for solid-state LiDARs because they allow electronic scanning without mechanical moving parts. However, their resolutions have been limited to 512 pixels or smaller 2 . In this paper, we report on a 16,384-pixel LiDAR with a wide field of view (FoV, 70° × 70°), a fine addressing resolution (0.6° × 0.6°), a narrow beam divergence (0.050° × 0.049°) and a random-access beam addressing with sub-MHz operation speed. The 128 × 128-element focal plane switch array (FPSA) of grating antennas and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-actuated optical switches are monolithically integrated on a 10 × 11-mm 2 silicon photonic chip, where a 128 × 96 subarray is wire bonded and tested in experiments. 3D imaging with a distance resolution of 1.7 cm is achieved with frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) ranging in monostatic configuration. The FPSA can be mass-produced in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) foundries, which will allow ubiquitous 3D sensors for use in autonomous cars, drones, robots and smartphones."
https://openalex.org/W4220700063,"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a central hub of cellular metabolism, oxidizing nutrients to generate reducing equivalents for energy production and critical metabolites for biosynthetic reactions. Despite the importance of the products of the TCA cycle for cell viability and proliferation, mammalian cells display diversity in TCA-cycle activity1,2. How this diversity is achieved, and whether it is critical for establishing cell fate, remains poorly understood. Here we identify a non-canonical TCA cycle that is required for changes in cell state. Genetic co-essentiality mapping revealed a cluster of genes that is sufficient to compose a biochemical alternative to the canonical TCA cycle, wherein mitochondrially derived citrate exported to the cytoplasm is metabolized by ATP citrate lyase, ultimately regenerating mitochondrial oxaloacetate to complete this non-canonical TCA cycle. Manipulating the expression of ATP citrate lyase or the canonical TCA-cycle enzyme aconitase 2 in mouse myoblasts and embryonic stem cells revealed that changes in the configuration of the TCA cycle accompany cell fate transitions. During exit from pluripotency, embryonic stem cells switch from canonical to non-canonical TCA-cycle metabolism. Accordingly, blocking the non-canonical TCA cycle prevents cells from exiting pluripotency. These results establish a context-dependent alternative to the traditional TCA cycle and reveal that appropriate TCA-cycle engagement is required for changes in cell state. A non-canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle is required for changes in cell state."
https://openalex.org/W4221126107,"There is some weak evidence that the black hole merger named GW190521 had a non-zero eccentricity1,2. In addition, the masses of the component black holes exceeded the limit predicted by stellar evolution3. The large masses can be explained by successive mergers4,5, which may be efficient in gas disks surrounding active galactic nuclei, but it is difficult to maintain an eccentric orbit all the way to the merger, as basic physics would argue for circularization6. Here we show that active galactic nuclei disk environments can lead to an excess of eccentric mergers, if the interactions between single and binary black holes are frequent5 and occur with mutual inclinations of less than a few degrees. We further illustrate that this eccentric population has a different distribution of the inclination between the spin vectors of the black holes and their orbital angular momentum at merger7, referred to as the spin-orbit tilt, compared with the remaining circular mergers."
https://openalex.org/W4220981622,"Methane (CH4), the most abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere, originates largely from biogenic sources1 linked to an increasing number of organisms occurring in oxic and anoxic environments. Traditionally, biogenic CH4 has been regarded as the final product of anoxic decomposition of organic matter by methanogenic archaea. However, plants2,3, fungi4, algae5 and cyanobacteria6 can produce CH4 in the presence of oxygen. Although methanogens are known to produce CH4 enzymatically during anaerobic energy metabolism7, the requirements and pathways for CH4 production by non-methanogenic cells are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CH4 formation by Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli is triggered by free iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are generated by metabolic activity and enhanced by oxidative stress. ROS-induced methyl radicals, which are derived from organic compounds containing sulfur- or nitrogen-bonded methyl groups, are key intermediates that ultimately lead to CH4 production. We further show CH4 production by many other model organisms from the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya domains, including in several human cell lines. All these organisms respond to inducers of oxidative stress by enhanced CH4 formation. Our results imply that all living cells probably possess a common mechanism of CH4 formation that is based on interactions among ROS, iron and methyl donors, opening new perspectives for understanding biochemical CH4 formation and cycling. Methane formation by a ROS-mediated process is linked to metabolic activity and is identified as a conserved feature across living systems."

https://openalex.org/W4220698423,"Rare-earth ions (REIs) are promising solid-state systems for building light-matter interfaces at the quantum level1,2. This relies on their potential to show narrow optical and spin homogeneous linewidths, or, equivalently, long-lived quantum states. This enables the use of REIs for photonic quantum technologies such as memories for light, optical-microwave transduction and computing3-5. However, so far, few crystalline materials have shown an environment quiet enough to fully exploit REI properties. This hinders further progress, in particular towards REI-containing integrated nanophotonics devices6,7. Molecular systems can provide such capability but generally lack spin states. If, however, molecular systems do have spin states, they show broad optical lines that severely limit optical-to-spin coherent interfacing8-10. Here we report on europium molecular crystals that exhibit linewidths in the tens of kilohertz range, orders of magnitude narrower than those of other molecular systems. We harness this property to demonstrate efficient optical spin initialization, coherent storage of light using an atomic frequency comb, and optical control of ion-ion interactions towards implementation of quantum gates. These results illustrate the utility of rare-earth molecular crystals as a new platform for photonic quantum technologies that combines highly coherent emitters with the unmatched versatility in composition, structure and integration capability of molecular materials."
https://openalex.org/W4220817800,"Cells display complex intracellular organization by compartmentalization of metabolic processes into organelles, yet the resolution of these structures in the native tissue context and their functional consequences are not well understood. Here we resolved the three-dimensional structural organization of organelles in large (more than 2.8 × 105 µm3) volumes of intact liver tissue (15 partial or full hepatocytes per condition) at high resolution (8 nm isotropic pixel size) using enhanced focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy1,2 imaging followed by deep-learning-based automated image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. We also performed a comparative analysis of subcellular structures in liver tissue of lean and obese mice and found substantial alterations, particularly in hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which undergoes massive structural reorganization characterized by marked disorganization of stacks of ER sheets3 and predominance of ER tubules. Finally, we demonstrated the functional importance of these structural changes by monitoring the effects of experimental recovery of the subcellular organization on cellular and systemic metabolism. We conclude that the hepatic subcellular organization of the ER architecture are highly dynamic, integrated with the metabolic state and critical for adaptive homeostasis and tissue health."
https://openalex.org/W4220675341,"Ribosome rescue pathways recycle stalled ribosomes and target problematic mRNAs and aborted proteins for degradation1,2. In bacteria, it remains unclear how rescue pathways distinguish ribosomes stalled in the middle of a transcript from actively translating ribosomes3-6. Here, using a genetic screen in Escherichia coli, we discovered a new rescue factor that has endonuclease activity. SmrB cleaves mRNAs upstream of stalled ribosomes, allowing the ribosome rescue factor tmRNA (which acts on truncated mRNAs3) to rescue upstream ribosomes. SmrB is recruited to ribosomes and is activated by collisions. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of collided disomes from E. coli and Bacillus subtilis show distinct and conserved arrangements of individual ribosomes and the composite SmrB-binding site. These findings reveal the underlying mechanisms by which ribosome collisions trigger ribosome rescue in bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W4221118099,"Vesicular transporters (VTs) define the type of neurotransmitter that synaptic vesicles (SVs) store and release. While certain mammalian neurons release multiple transmitters, it is not clear whether the release occurs from the same or distinct vesicle pools at the synapse. Using quantitative single-vesicle imaging, we show that a vast majority of SVs in the rodent brain contain only one type of VT, indicating specificity for a single neurotransmitter. Interestingly, SVs containing dual transporters are highly diverse (27 types) but small in proportion (2% of all SVs), excluding the largest pool that carries VGLUT1 and ZnT3 (34%). Using VGLUT1-ZnT3 SVs, we demonstrate that the transporter colocalization influences the SV content and synaptic quantal size. Thus, the presence of diverse transporters on the same vesicle is bona fide, and depending on the VT types, this may act to regulate neurotransmitter type, content, and release in space and time."
https://openalex.org/W4221134661,"Ribosome stalling during translation is detrimental to cellular fitness, but how this is sensed and elicits recycling of ribosomal subunits and quality control of associated mRNA and incomplete nascent chains is poorly understood1,2. Here we uncover Bacillus subtilis MutS2, a member of the conserved MutS family of ATPases that function in DNA mismatch repair3, as an unexpected ribosome-binding protein with an essential function in translational quality control. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of affinity-purified native complexes shows that MutS2 functions in sensing collisions between stalled and translating ribosomes and suggests how ribosome collisions can serve as platforms to deploy downstream processes: MutS2 has an RNA endonuclease small MutS-related (SMR) domain, as well as an ATPase/clamp domain that is properly positioned to promote ribosomal subunit dissociation, which is a requirement both for ribosome recycling and for initiation of ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC). Accordingly, MutS2 promotes nascent chain modification with alanine-tail degrons-an early step in RQC-in an ATPase domain-dependent manner. The relevance of these observations is underscored by evidence of strong co-occurrence of MutS2 and RQC genes across bacterial phyla. Overall, the findings demonstrate a deeply conserved role for ribosome collisions in mounting a complex response to the interruption of translation within open reading frames."
https://openalex.org/W4220746670,"Abstract The tumor stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by an abundant and heterogeneous population of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are critically involved in chemoresistance. However, the underlying mechanism of CAFs in chemoresistance is unclear. Here, we show that CAF R , a CAF subset derived from platinum-resistant PDAC patients, assumes an iCAF phenotype and produces more IL8 than CAF S isolated from platinum-sensitive PDAC patients. CAF R -derived IL8 promotes oxaliplatin chemoresistance in PDAC. Based on long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) profiling in tumor cells incubated with CAF-CM, we found that UPK1A-AS1, whose expression is directly induced by IL8/NF-kappa B signaling, functions as a chemoresistance-promoting lncRNA and is critical for active IL8-induced oxaliplatin resistance. Impressively, blocking the activation of UPK1A-AS1 expression increases the oxaliplatin sensitivity of tumor cells in vivo. Mechanistically, UPK1A-AS1 strengthens the interaction between Ku70 and Ku80 to facilitate nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), thereby enhancing DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Clinically, UPK1A-AS1 expression is positively correlated with IL8 expression, a poor chemotherapeutic response and a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) time in advanced PDAC patients. Collectively, our study reveals a lncRNA-mediated mechanism of CAF-derived paracrine IL8-dependent oxaliplatin resistance and highlights UPK1A-AS1 as a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W4220757519,"The brain generates complex sequences of movements that can be flexibly configured based on behavioural context or real-time sensory feedback1, but how this occurs is not fully understood. Here we developed a ‘sequence licking’ task in which mice directed their tongue to a target that moved through a series of locations. Mice could rapidly branch the sequence online based on tactile feedback. Closed-loop optogenetics and electrophysiology revealed that the tongue and jaw regions of the primary somatosensory (S1TJ) and motor (M1TJ) cortices2 encoded and controlled tongue kinematics at the level of individual licks. By contrast, the tongue ‘premotor’ (anterolateral motor) cortex3–10 encoded latent variables including intended lick angle, sequence identity and progress towards the reward that marked successful sequence execution. Movement-nonspecific sequence branching signals occurred in the anterolateral motor cortex and M1TJ. Our results reveal a set of key cortical areas for flexible and context-informed sequence generation. A sequence licking task reveals a set of key cortical regions for the coding of movement sequences in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4221035306,"Nitrogen availability is a growth-limiting factor in many habitats1, and the global nitrogen cycle involves prokaryotes and eukaryotes competing for this precious resource. Only some bacteria and archaea can fix elementary nitrogen; all other organisms depend on the assimilation of mineral or organic nitrogen. The nitrogen-rich compound guanidine occurs widely in nature2-4, but its utilization is impeded by pronounced resonance stabilization5, and enzymes catalysing hydrolysis of free guanidine have not been identified. Here we describe the arginase family protein GdmH (Sll1077) from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a Ni2+-dependent guanidine hydrolase. GdmH is highly specific for free guanidine. Its activity depends on two accessory proteins that load Ni2+ instead of the typical Mn2+ ions into the active site. Crystal structures of GdmH show coordination of the dinuclear metal cluster in a geometry typical for arginase family enzymes and allow modelling of the bound substrate. A unique amino-terminal extension and a tryptophan residue narrow the substrate-binding pocket and identify homologous proteins in further cyanobacteria, several other bacterial taxa and heterokont algae as probable guanidine hydrolases. This broad distribution suggests notable ecological relevance of guanidine hydrolysis in aquatic habitats."
https://openalex.org/W4220950304,"Light is a powerful modulator of non-visual functions. Although accumulating evidence suggests an antinociceptive effect of bright light treatment, the precise circuits that mediate the effects of light on nocifensive behaviors remain unclear. Here, we show that bright light treatment suppresses mouse nocifensive behaviors through a visual circuit related to the lateral and ventral lateral parts of the periaqueductal gray area (l/vlPAG). Specifically, a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) innervates GABAergic neurons in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and intergeniculate leaflet (vLGN/IGL), which in turn inhibit GABAergic neurons in the l/vlPAG. The activation of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs, activation of l/vlPAG-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons, or inhibition of postsynaptic l/vlPAG neurons is sufficient to suppress nocifensive behaviors. Importantly, we demonstrate that the antinociceptive effects of bright light treatment are dependent on the activation of the retina-vLGN/IGL-l/vlPAG pathway. Together, our results delineate an l/vlPAG-related visual circuit underlying the antinociceptive effects of bright light treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4220898594,"Cubic CaSiO3 perovskite is a major phase in subducted oceanic crust, where it forms at a depth of about 550 kilometres from majoritic garnet1,2,28. However, its rheological properties at temperatures and pressures typical of the lower mantle are poorly known. Here we measured the plastic strength of cubic CaSiO3 perovskite at pressure and temperature conditions typical for a subducting slab up to a depth of about 1,200 kilometres. In contrast to tetragonal CaSiO3, previously investigated at room temperature3,4, we find that cubic CaSiO3 perovskite is a comparably weak phase at the temperatures of the lower mantle. We find that its strength and viscosity are substantially lower than that of bridgmanite and ferropericlase, possibly making cubic CaSiO3 perovskite the weakest lower-mantle phase. Our findings suggest that cubic CaSiO3 perovskite governs the dynamics of subducting slabs. Weak CaSiO3 perovskite further provides a mechanism to separate subducted oceanic crust from the underlying mantle. Depending on the depth of the separation, basaltic crust could accumulate at the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, where cubic CaSiO3 perovskite may contribute to the seismically observed regions of low shear-wave velocities in the uppermost lower mantle5,6, or sink to the core-mantle boundary and explain the seismic anomalies associated with large low-shear-velocity provinces beneath Africa and the Pacific7-9."

https://openalex.org/W4221003540,"Introduction Even though people of the world were eagerly waiting for the hope of vaccine development, vaccine hesitancy is becoming the top concern in both developed and developing countries. However, there is no adequate evidence regarding the attitude and perception of health professionals towards the COVID 19 vaccine in resource-limited settings like Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess health professionals’ attitudes and perceptions towards COVID 19 vaccine in Western Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health care workers found in Nekemte town from April 14–21, 2021. A total of 439 health professionals present on duty during the study period was included in the study. The data were collected by using self-administered questionnaire. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and STATA version 14 was used for data analysis. The binary logistic regression model was employed to determine factors associated with the attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals was computed and statistical significance was declared at a 5% level (p-value &lt; 0.05). Result A total of 431 health professionals participated in the study yielding a response rate of 98.1%. The results indicated that 51.28% (95%CI: 45.12%, 57.34%) of health professionals had a favorable attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Having good knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.22, 0.64, P-value &lt;0.001) was negatively associated with unfavorable attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine, whereas age less than 30 years (AOR = 2.14, 95%CI:1.25,3.67, P-value &lt;0.001), working in a private clinic (AOR = 7.77, 95% CI: 2.19, 27.58, P-value &lt;0.001) and health center (AOR = 2.45, 95%CI: 1.01, 5.92, P-value = 0.045) were positively associated with unfavorable attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion and recommendation In general, the attitude and perception of health care professionals toward the COVID-19 vaccine in the study area were unsatisfactory. Knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine, age of health care workers, and place of work are the factors which affects attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, we recommend the media outlets and concerned bodies to work to develop trust among the public by disseminating accurate and consistent information about the vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4220686964,"We have shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can spread hematogenously from infected airways of a pregnant woman to the developing fetal lungs in utero . This study sought to measure RSV replication, cytopathic effects, and protein expression in human lung organoids (HLOs) reproducing architecture and transcriptional profiles of human fetal lungs during the 1 st trimester of gestation. HLOs derived from human pluripotent stem cells were microinjected after 50 or 100 days in culture with medium or recombinant RSV-A2 expressing the red fluorescent protein gene (rrRSV). Infection was monitored by fluorescent microscopy and PCR. Immunohistochemistry and proteomic analysis were performed. RSV infected HLOs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. RSV-infected HLOs increased expression of CC10 (Club cells), but had sparse FOXJ1 (ciliated cells). Disruption of F-actin cytoskeleton was consistent with proteomic data showing a significant increase in Rho GTPases proteins. RSV upregulated the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1 ) channel and, while β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) expression was decreased overall, its phosphorylated form increased. Our data suggest that prenatal RSV infection produces profound changes in fetal lungs’ architecture and expression profiles and maybe an essential precursor of chronic airway dysfunction. expression profiles, and possibly be an important precursor of chronic airway dysfunction."

The first is the identification and assessment of the relationship between benevolent leadership and employees’ affective commitment in the context of Polish organizations. Secondly, it will be investigated whether all constructs of benevolent leadership contribute to affective commitment. Data were obtained from 415 company employees. The relationships were investigated using structural equation models (SEMs). Analyses of the results showed that benevolent leadership has a positive relationship with affective commitment. The more benevolent leadership qualities a supervisor has, the more commitment employees show. All dimensions of benevolent leadership are positively correlated with affective commitment. However, the greatest was found in the “community dimension.” All analyzed dimensions correlate positively with each other, so there is a high probability that if a leader displays one BL dimension, he will also display another."
https://openalex.org/W4220674065,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and genotype distribution data is important for HPV vaccine monitoring. This study investigated the prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes in cervical lesions of unvaccinated women referred to Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital Gynaecology Department due to different abnormal cervical conditions. A total of 459 women referred to the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital Gynaecology department were recruited. When the cervical biopsy was collected for histopathology, an adjacent biopsy was provided for HPV detection. Roche Linear Array HPV genotyping assay that detects 37 HPV genotypes was used to detect HPV infection in cervical biopsies. HPV infection was detected in 84.2% (383/455) of participants. The six most dominant HPV types were HPV-16 (34.7%), followed by HPV-35 (17.4%), HPV-58 (12.1%), HPV-45 (11.6%), HPV-18 (11.4%) and HPV-52 (9.7%). HPV-35 was the third most dominant type among women with cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIN)-2 (12.6%; single infection: 5.7% and multiple infection: 6.9%), the second most dominant type among women with CIN3 (22.2%; single infection: 8.0% and multiple infection: 14.2%); and the fourth most dominant type among women with cervical cancer (12.5%; single infection: 7.1% and multiple infection: 5.4%). A proportion of 41.1% (187/455) was positive for HPV types targeted by the Cervarix®, 42.4% (193/455) by Gardasil®4, and 66.6% (303/455) by Gardasil®9. There was a statistically significant increase when the prevalence of women infected with HPV-35 only or with other HPV types other than Gardasil®9 types was included to those infected with Gardasil®9 HPV types (66.6%, 303/455 increase to 76.0%, 346/455, p = 0.002). High HPV-35 prevalence in this population, especially among women with CIN3 warrants attention since it is not included in current commercially available HPV vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4220773106,"The health and economic burden of colitis is increasing globally. Understanding the role of host genetics and metagenomics is essential to establish the molecular basis of colitis pathogenesis. In the present study, we have used a common composite dose of DSS to compare the differential disease severity response in C57BL/6 (Th1 biased) and BALB/c (Th2 biased) mice with zero mortality rates. We employed multi-omics approaches and developed a newer vector analysis approach to understand the molecular basis of the disease pathogenesis. In the current report, comparative transcriptomics, metabonomics, and metagenomics analyses revealed that the Th1 background of C57BL/6 induced intense inflammatory responses throughout the treatment period. On the contrary, the Th2 background of BALB/c resisted severe inflammatory responses by modulating the host's inflammatory, metabolic, and gut microbial profile. The multi-omics approach also helped us discover some unique metabolic and microbial markers associated with the disease severity. These biomarkers could be used in diagnostics."

We quantified the rate of RSV-associated hospitalization in adults by CHF status using population-based surveillance in the United States.Population-based surveillance for RSV (RSV-NET) was performed in 35 counties in seven sites during two respiratory seasons (2015-2017) from October 1-April 30. Adults (≥18 years) admitted to a hospital within the surveillance catchment area with laboratory-confirmed RSV identified by clinician-directed testing were included. Presence of underlying CHF was determined by medical chart abstraction. We calculated overall and age-stratified (<65 years and ≥65 years) RSV-associated hospitalization rates by CHF status. Estimates were adjusted for age and the under-detection of RSV. We also report rate differences (RD) and rate ratios (RR) by comparing the rates for those with and without CHF.2042 hospitalized RSV cases with CHF status recorded were identified. Most (60.2%, n = 1230) were ≥65 years, and 28.3% (n = 577) had CHF. The adjusted RSV hospitalization rate was 26.7 (95% CI: 22.2, 31.8) per 10,000 population in adults with CHF versus 3.3 (95% CI: 3.3, 3.3) per 10,000 in adults without CHF (RR: 8.1, 95% CI: 6.8, 9.7; RD: 23.4, 95% CI: 18.9, 28.5).

https://openalex.org/W4220680091,"Bryophyllum pinnatum (Lam.) Oken (BP) is a plant that is used worldwide to treat inflammation, infections, anxiety, restlessness, and sleep disorders. While it is known that BP leaves are rich in flavonoids, the extent of the beneficial and toxic effects of its crude extracts remains unclear. Although some neurobehavioral studies using leaf extracts have been conducted, none has examined the effects of water-extracted leaf samples. The zebrafish is a powerful animal model used to gain insights into the efficacy and toxicity profiles of this plant due to its high fecundity, external development, and ease of performing behavioral assays. In this study, we performed behavioral testing after acute exposure to different concentrations of aqueous extract from leaves of B. pinnatum (LABP) on larval zebrafish, investigating light/dark preference, thigmotaxis, and locomotor activity parameters under both normal and stressed conditions. LABP demonstrated dose-and time-dependent biphasic effects on larval behavior. Acute exposure (25 min) to 500 mg/L LABP resulted in decreased locomotor activity. Exposure to 300 mg/L LABP during the sleep cycle decreased dark avoidance and thigmotaxis while increasing swimming velocity. After sleep deprivation, the group treated with 100 mg/L LABP showed decreased dark avoidance and increased velocity. After a heating stressor, the 30 mg/L and 300 mg/L LABP-treated groups showed decreased dark avoidance. These results suggest both anxiolytic and psychoactive effects of LABP in a dose-dependent manner in a larval zebrafish model. These findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying relevant behavioral effects, consequently supporting the safe and effective use of LABP for the treatment of mood disorders."

The study compares ten industrialized countries across Asia, Europe, and North America. In all ten countries, gender differences in time use are smaller in personal care, sleeping and meals, followed by leisure time (including screen-based leisure and active leisure), and largest in housework, care work and paid work activities. Gender disparities in time use are higher in South Korea, Hungary, and Italy, followed closely by Spain, with moderate gender gaps in Western European countries like France and Netherlands, and lowest differences in Finland and Anglo-Saxon countries, including Canada, US, and the UK. Gender differences in housework and caring time increase from adolescence (10–17 years) to early adulthood (18–29 years), showing strong gender gaps in early/middle adulthood (30–44 years), but narrow again during late adulthood (65 years or older). However, the age gradient in care work and housework is most pronounced in Italy and South Korea, being less prominent in Canada and Finland. Gender gaps in paid work are larger in early/middle adulthood (30–44) and middle/late adulthood (45–64), with strongest age gradients observed in the Netherlands and weaker gradients for the US. Gender differences in active leisure increase by age, especially in Southern European countries, while screen-based leisure shows more stable gender gaps by age groups across different countries. Overall, this study shows that age and gender intersect strongly in affecting time-use patterns, but also that the national context plays an important role in shaping gender-age interactions in time use allocation."
https://openalex.org/W4221119137,"Cell culture studies offer the unique possibility to investigate the influence of pharmacological treatments with quantified dosages applied for defined time durations on survival, morphological maturation, protein expression and function as well as the mutual interaction of various cell types. Cultures obtained from postnatal rat brain contain a substantial number of glial cells that further proliferate with time in culture leading to an overgrowth of neurons with glia, especially astrocytes and microglia. A well-established method to decrease glial proliferation in vitro is to apply low concentrations of cytosine arabinoside (AraC). While AraC primarily effects dividing cells, it has been reported repeatedly that it is also neurotoxic, which is the reason why most protocols limit its application to concentrations of up to 5 μM for a duration of 24 h. Here, we investigated 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR) as a possible substitute for AraC. We applied concentrations of both cytostatics ranging from 4 μM to 75 μM and compared cell composition and cell viability in cultures prepared from 0-2- and 3-4-day old rat pups. Using FUdR as proliferation inhibitor, higher ratios of neurons to glia cells were obtained with a maximal neuron to astrocyte ratio of up to 10:1, which could not be obtained using AraC in postnatal cultures. Patch-clamp recordings revealed no difference in the amplitudes of voltage-gated Na+ currents in neurons treated with FUdR compared with untreated control cells suggesting replacement of AraC by FUdR as glia proliferation inhibitor if highly neuron-enriched postnatal cultures are desired."

This study sought to determine the self-reported knowledge levels of healthcare providers most likely to come in direct contact with victims of human trafficking.An anonymous survey assessing self-reported knowledge of human trafficking was developed and distributed online. Demographic information and questions pertaining to training and knowledge of trafficking in a healthcare setting were asked. The primary outcomes were descriptive statistics and secondary outcomes were comparisons among demographic groups. Qualitative methodology via content analysis was implemented on an open-ended question.The 6,603 respondents represented all regions of the country. Medical, nursing, and physician assistant students comprised 23% of the sample, while 40% were either physicians, fellows, or residents. Less than half the respondents (42%) have received formal training in human trafficking, while an overwhelming majority (93%) believe they would benefit by such training. Overall, respondents thought their level of knowledge of trafficking was average to below average (mean = 2.64 on a 5-point scale). There were significant differences in knowledge of trafficking by age group (p < .001), region (p < .001), and educational training level (p < .001). 949 respondents (14.4%) provided free-text comments that further described their opinions.Most respondents stated they have not received training but felt they would benefit from it. There were significant differences between demographic groups. Further innovation is needed to design a universally appropriate curriculum on human trafficking that is accessible to all healthcare providers as well as mandatory training programs for healthcare institutions."
https://openalex.org/W4220866271,"Background Tuberculosis burden among the incarcerated population is generally higher than that of general population. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment are key strategies to contain disease transmission. The aim of this study was to determine the time to treatment initiation among inmates with new smear or Xpert MTB/RIF positive pulmonary tuberculosis and explore risk factors associated with delayed treatment initiation in prison settings. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine health care data from prison settings in Kzrgyz Republic on new pulmonary tuberculosis patients confirmed by smear microscopy or GeneXpert MTB/RIF during 2014–2019. We computed delay in start of treatment—days from specimen collection to treatment initiation—for exposure variables. We dichotomized treatment delay using 10-day cut-off point,and used logistic regression to identify factors associated with treatment delay. Results Among 406 cases included into analysis, the median delay to treatment initiation was 7 days [IQR: 2–16 days]. Using 10-day cut-off, 189 (46.6%) patients had delayed treatment initiation. Treatment delay was negatively associated with smear positivity [adjusted OR (aOR) = 0.44, 95% CI 0.29–0.68] compared to smear negative patients, while patients with isoniazid resistant (aOR = 2.61, 95%CI 1.49–4.56) and rifampicin resistant tuberculosis (aOR = 4.14, 95%CI 2.56–6.77) had increased delay compared to patients who were sensitive for both rifampicin and isoniazid. Conclusion Timely diagnosis and effective treatment remain the cornerstone of TB control program populations in the general and in prison settings in particular. Prison authorities need to address all potential areas of delay in TB diagnosis and treatment to strengthen their TB control efforts so that prisons remain free of TB for detainees, prison staff and visitors. These include improved supply of TB drugs, early detection of TB cases and improved collaboration with the health authorities outside the prison system."

Identification of infected patients and discrimination from other respiratory infections have so far been accomplished by using highly specific real-time PCRs. Here we present a rapid multiplex approach (RespiCoV), combining highly multiplexed PCRs and MinION sequencing suitable for the simultaneous screening for 41 viral and five bacterial agents related to respiratory tract infections, including the human coronaviruses NL63, HKU1, OC43, 229E, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. RespiCoV was applied to 150 patient samples with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared with specific real-time PCR. Additionally, several respiratory tract pathogens were identified in samples tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, RespiCoV was experimentally compared to the commercial RespiFinder 2SMART multiplex screening assay (PathoFinder, The Netherlands)."
https://openalex.org/W4220682722,"Background and objectives Immunoglobulin a nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerular disease in the world, with different clinical manifestations, varying severity of pathological changes, common complications of crescent formation in different proportions, and great individual heterogeneous in clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aim to develop a machine learning (ML) based predictive model for predicting the prognosis of IgAN with focal crescent formation and without obvious chronic renal lesions (glomerulosclerosis &lt;25%). Materials We retrospectively reviewed biopsy-proven IgAN patients in our hospital and cooperative hospital from 2005 to 2017. The method of feature importance of random forest (RF) was applied to conduct feature exploration of feature variables to establish the characteristic variables that are closely related to the prognosis of focal crescent IgAN. Multiple ML algorithms were attempted to establish the prediction models. The area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were applied to evaluate the predictive performance via three-fold cross validation (namely 2 training sets and 1 validation set). Results RF was used to screen the important features, the top three of which were baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatine and triglyceride. Ten important features were selected as important predictors for modeling on the basis of data-driven and medical selection, predictors include: age, baseline eGFR, serum creatine, serum triglycerides, complement 3(C3), proteinuria, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and Hematuria, crescents proportion of glomeruli, Global crescent proportion of glomeruli. In a variety of ML algorithms, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm displayed better predictive performance, with Precision of 0.77, Recall of 0.77, F1-score of 0.73, accuracy of 0.77, AUROC of 79.57%, and AUPRC of 76.5%. Conclusions The SVM model is potentially useful for predicting the prognosis of IgAN patients with focal crescent shape and without obvious chronic renal lesions."
https://openalex.org/W4220787796,"Dog harnesses are becoming more popular, with their large variety stemming from the idea that different dogs and scenarios require different types of harnesses. While their benefits over collars are self-explanatory, there is a lack of research on their effect on gait, and even the existing studies examine only a limited set of parameters. The goal of present study was to establish a method capable of quantifying canine gait in detail. Based on 3D motion capture, the developed method allows for the examination of 18 joint angles and 35 spatio-temporal parameters throughout multiple gait cycles, and can be used to analyze canine movement in detail in any kind of scenario (e.g. comparing healthy and lame dogs, or measuring the effect of training). The method is presented through the measurement of how different harnesses affect walking kinematics compared to free (unleashed) movements. Four dogs with varying body sizes and breeds and multiple types of harnesses were included. Marker data was filtered using a zero-lag 6th order Butterworth-filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz. The normality of the spatio-temporal and joint range of motion parameters was tested using the Anderson-Darling test (p = 0.05), with most parameters passing in 60+% of test cases. Swing time and range of motion of the sagittal aspect of spinal angle at T1 vertebrae failed more regularly, both resulting from the measurement setup rather than the actual parameters being not normally distributed. Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (p = 0.05) were used to compare each parameter's distribution between cases, showing that most parameters are significantly altered by the harnesses in about 2/3rd of the cases. Based on the results, there's no absolute superior harness, however, it is possible to select the best fit for a specific dog and application, justifying their large variety."
https://openalex.org/W4220911974,"The aim of this paper was to investigate the influence of four different external factors (acetylcholine, ethanol, temperature and lidocaine hydrochloride) on PC12 quasi-neuronal networks by multielectrode-array-based Voltage Threshold Measurement Method (VTMM). At first, VTMM was employed to measure the lowest amplitude of the voltage stimulating pulses that could just trigger the action potential from PC12 quasi-neuronal networks under normal conditions, and the amplitude was defined as the normal voltage threshold (VTh). Then the changes of the VTh of PC12 quasi-neuronal networks treated by the four external factors were tested respectively. The results showed the normal VTh of PC12 quasi-neuronal networks was 36 mV. The VTh has negative correlation with the concentration of acetylcholine and has positive correlation with the concentration of ethanol. The curves of the correlation of the VTh with temperature and the concentration of lidocaine hydrochloride were U-shaped and Λ-shaped respectively. Comparing with our earlier studies on hippocampal neuronal networks and hippocampal slices, PC12 quasi-neuronal networks not only had the same typical voltage threshold characteristic, but also had similar changes on electrical excitability when treated by the four external factors mentioned above. Therefore, the rapid-formed PC12 quasi-neuronal networks could replace neuronal networks in proper conditions, and VTMM could be used to analyze the influence of external factors on the electrical excitability of PC12 quasi-neuronal networks."
https://openalex.org/W4220926508,"The way people respond to stressful situations (i.e., stress reactivity) varies widely. Researchers typically measure stress reactivity in controlled studies, but this is limited because laboratory stressors cannot capture the variety, severity, or duration of stressors that individuals face in their daily lives. The present study examined the feasibility of using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and a wireless electrocardiography (ECG) patch to develop an understanding of stress reactivity in natural settings. Thirty-five adult women completed EMA surveys about stressors they were exposed to while wearing a wireless ECG monitor for 7 consecutive days. Daily stressors were measured using seven questions adapted from the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events and a stressor interval was defined as the presence of at least one stressor during the EMA survey prompt. Participants wore the Cardea SOLO wireless ECG monitor (Cardiac Insight Inc., Bellevue, WA) to continuously track their heart rate. Participant-specific differences in 5-minute heart rate variability (HRV) between intervals when participants did and did not report stressors were calculated and displayed in a heat map. Survey response rate was satisfactory (72.0%, n = 588) and nearly all participants (33 out of 35) reported both stressor and non-stressor intervals. Each participant reported at least one stressor on approximately 35% of completed surveys while wearing the ECG patch. Mean wear time (6.6 days) and the duration of analyzable data with an ECG monitor were close to the 7-day study period. While many participants had lower HRV during stressor versus non-stressor intervals, the magnitude and direction of these differences varied widely. In summary, we found that a 7-day sampling scheme combining ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with HRV measured using continuous ECG monitoring was feasible and effective in capturing a variety of daily stressors and measuring autonomic stress reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W4220939601,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic gram-negative bacteria typically attributed to hospital-associated infection. It could also become multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and pan drug-resistant (PDR) during a short period. Although A. baumannii has been documented extensively, complete knowledge on the antibiotic-resistant mechanisms and virulence factors responsible for pathogenesis has not been entirely elucidated. This study investigated the drug resistance pattern and characterized the genomic sequence by de novo assembly of PDR A. baumannii strain VJR422, which was isolated from a catheter-sputum specimen. The results showed that the VJR422 strain was resistant to any existing antibiotics. Based on de novo assembly, whole-genome sequences showed a total genome size of 3,924,675-bp. In silico and conventional MLST analysis of sequence type (ST) of this strain was new ST by Oxford MLST scheme and designated as ST1890. Moreover, we found 10,915 genes that could be classified into 45 categories by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. There were 1,687 genes mapped to 34 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The statistics from Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) annotation identified 3,189 genes of the VJR422 strain. Regarding the existence of virulence factors, a total of 59 virulence factors were identified in the genome of the VJR422 strain by virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria databases (VFDB). The drug-resistant genes were investigated by searching in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). The strain harbored antibiotic-resistant genes responsible for aminoglycoside, β-lactam-ring-containing drugs, erythromycin, and streptogramin resistance. We also identified resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) and the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) associated with the antibiotic efflux pump. Overall, this study focused on A. baumannii strain VJR422 at the genomic level data, i.e., GO, COG, and KEGG. The antibiotic-resistant genotype and phenotype as well as the presence of potential virulence associated factors were investigated."

https://openalex.org/W4220960559,"Broccoli sprouts (BSp), a cruciferous vegetable, has shown promising effects on prevention of many types of cancer including breast cancer (BC). BC has a developmental foundation, and maternal nutrition status may influence an offspring's risk to BC later in life. What is less understood, however, is the influence of maternal nutrition intervention on reversing epigenomic abnormalities that are essential in BC programming during early development. Our research focused on how maternal exposure to BSp diet prevents offspring BC and investigation of possible epigenetic mechanisms during these processes. Our results showed that maternal feeding of BSp can prevent mammary tumor development in the offspring of a transgenic mouse model. Through comprehensive integrated multi-omics studies on transcriptomic and methylomic analysis, we identified numerous target genes exhibiting significantly differential gene expression and DNA methylation patterns in the offspring mammary tumor. We discovered that maternal exposure to BSp diet can induce both gene and methylation changes in several key genes such as Avpr2, Cyp4a12b, Dpp6, Gria2, Pcdh9 and Tspan11 that are correlated with pivotal biological functions during carcinogenesis. In addition, we found an impact of maternal BSp treatment on DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylases activity. Our study provides knowledgeable information regarding how maternal BSp diet influences key tumor-related gene expression and the epigenetic changes using a genome-wide perspective. Additionally, these findings provide mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of maternal BSp administration on the prevention of BC in the offspring later in life, which may lead to an early-life BC chemopreventive strategy that benefits the progenies' long-term health."
https://openalex.org/W4221002082,"We compared the motor competence between overweight/obese and eutrophic preschoolers with similar physical activity levels, age, socioeconomic status, maternal education, quality of the home environment and quality of the school environment. We also investigated to what extent excess body fat mass explains gross motor skills in preschoolers. A cross-sectional quantitative and exploratory study was conducted with 48 preschoolers assigned into eutrophic and overweight/obese groups. Overweight/obese preschoolers had worse Locomotor subtest standard scores than the eutrophic ones (p = 0.01), but similar Object Control subtest and Gross Motor Quotient scores (p > 0.05). Excess body fat mass explained 12% of the low Locomotor subtest standard scores in preschoolers (R2 = 0.12; p = 0.007). Excess body fat mass was associated with worse locomotor skills when the model was adjusted for physical activity levels, age, socioeconomic status, maternal education, quality of the home environment and quality of the school environment. Thus, excess body fat mass partly explains lower locomotor skills in preschoolers."
https://openalex.org/W4221042569,"Purpose We analyzed skin images with various color space models to objectively assess radiodermatitis severity in patients receiving whole-breast radiotherapy. Methods Twenty female patients diagnosed with breast cancer were enrolled prospectively. All patients received whole-breast radiotherapy without boost irradiation. Skin images for both irradiated and unirradiated breasts were recorded in red-green-blue (RGB) color space using a mobile skin analysis device. For longitudinal analysis, the images were acquired before radiotherapy (RT before ), approximately 7 days after the first fraction of radiotherapy (RT 7days ), RT 14days , and approximately 10 days after radiotherapy completion (RT after ). Four color space models (RGB, hue-saturation-value (HSV), L*a*b*, and YCbCr models) were employed to calculate twelve color space parameters for each skin image. Skin dose measurements for irradiated breasts were performed using nanoDot optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters on the first fraction of radiotherapy. Subsequently, acute radiation dermatitis in each patient was assessed according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring criteria at both RT 14days and RT after . Finally, several statistical analysis methods were applied to investigate the performance of the color space parameters to objectively assess the radiodermatitis. Results Owing to radiation-induced skin damage, R value of RGB model as well as S and V values of the HSV model for irradiated breasts increased significantly, while those for unirradiated breasts showed smaller increases. These parameters showed the longitudinal changes in color space parameters within each group and between groups over time with statistical significance. Strong correlations of the parameters for irradiated breasts at RT 7days with skin doses and those at RT after were observed with statistical significance. Conclusion The R value of RGB model as well as the S and V values of HSV model showed relatively better performance in evaluating the acute radiation dermatitis. These color space parameters could therefore serve as useful tools to assess radiodermatitis severity in a dose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W4221046394,"The Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2pandemic necessitated several changes in maternity care. We investigated maternity care providers' opinions on the positive and negative effects of these changes and on potential areas of improvement for future maternity care both in times of crisis and in regular maternity care.We conducted nineteen semi-structured in-depth interviews with obstetricians, obstetric residents, community-based and hospital-based midwives and obstetric nurses. The interviews were thematically analysed using inductive Thematic analysis.Five themes were generated: '(Dis)proportionate measures', 'A significant impact of COVID-19', 'Differing views on inter-provider cooperation', 'Reluctance to seek help' and 'Lessons learnt'. The Central Organizing Concept was: 'It was tough but necessary'. The majority of participants were positive about most of the measures that were taken and about their proportionality. These measures had a significant impact on maternity care providers, both mentally and on an organizational level. Most hospital-based care providers were positive about professional cooperation and communication, but some community-based midwives indicated that the cooperation between different midwifery care practices was suboptimal. Negative effects mentioned were a higher threshold for women to seek care, less partner involvement and perceived more fear among women and their partners, especially around birth. The most significant positive effect mentioned was increased use of eHealth tools. Recommendations for future care were to consider the necessity of prenatal and postnatal care more critically, to replace some face-to-face visits with eHealth and to provide more individualised care.Maternity care providers experienced measures and organizational changes during the first wave of the COVID19-pandemic as tough, but necessary. They believed that a more critical consideration of medically necessary care, increased use of e-health and more individualised care might contribute to making maternity care more sustainable during and after the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4220717326,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) are leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. There is a well-known comorbidity between COPD and CAD, which is only partly explained by smoking and other known common risk factors. In order to better understand the relationship between COPD and CAD, we analyzed myocardial perfusion, pulmonary function and novel cardiovascular biomarkers in patients with symptoms suggesting myocardial ischemia.A total of 396 subjects from the Swedish Biomarkers and Genetics CardioPulmonary Physiology Study (BiG CaPPS) were included, all of whom had been referred to myocardial perfusion imaging due to suspected myocardial ischemia. Subjects performed myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), pulmonary function tests (PFT) and analysis of 92 proteomic biomarkers, previously associated with cardiovascular disease. Linear regression was used to study the relationship between MPI and PFT results and proteomic biomarkers.Subjects with CAD (n = 159) had lower diffusing capacity (DLCO) than patients without CAD (6.64 versus 7.17 mmol/(min*kPa*l); p = 0.004) in models adjusted for common covariates such as smoking, but also diabetes and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The association remained significant after additional adjustment for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (p = 0.009). Subjects with CAD, compared with subjects without CAD, had higher total airway resistance (0.37 vs 0.36 kPa/(l/s); p = 0.036). Among 92 protein biomarkers, nine were associated with a combined diagnosis of CAD and airflow obstruction: VSIG2, KIM1, FGF-23, REN, XCL1, GIF, ADM, TRAIL-R2 and PRSS8.Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide is decreased in patients with CAD, independently of decreased FEV1, diabetes, and elevated BNP. Several cardiovascular biomarkers are associated with co-existent CAD and airflow obstruction, but none with airflow obstruction only. The current findings indicate that the interaction between CAD and lung function is complex, including mechanisms beyond the known association between CAD and reduced ventilation."

https://openalex.org/W4220853908,"Background Sputum smear microscopy is simple and feasible technique to assess the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the respiratory tract of patients with Drug Resistance Tuberculosis (DR-TB). Conversion of sputum smear from positive to negative is considered as an interim indicator of efficacy of anti-tubercular treatment and the program effectiveness. Although evidences regarding the factors affecting the sputum smear conversion are available on drug susceptible TB patients, there is dearth of literature about smear conversion and its predictors among DR-TB patients in the study setting. Hence, shortening the time to sputum smear conversion is desirable to reduce the likelihood of mycobacterial transmission. This study has therefore aimed at estimating the median time of sputum smear conversion and to determine its predictors. Methods This was a retrospective follow-up study conducted among DR-TB patients registered for second-line anti-TB treatment in the four hospitals of Amhara regional state, Northwest Ethiopia. Of all patients enrolled to DR-TB treatment in the study setting from 2010 to 2017, 436 patients have been include for this study who fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The cox proportional hazard model was fitted and the adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and p &lt;0.05 was used to declare statistical significance of the variables associated with the smear conversion. Results From the 436 patients with sputum smear positive at baseline, 351 (80.5%) converted sputum smear at a median time of 48 (IQR: 30–78) days. The median time of smear conversion was 59 (95% CI: 42, 74) and 44 (95% CI: 37, 54) days among patients who had and had no history of alcohol drinking, respectively. Similarly, the median time to smear conversion was 61 (95% CI: 36, 73) days among patients with comorbid conditions and 44 (95% CI: 38, 54) days among patients with no comorbid conditions. In the multi-variable analysis, only history of alcohol consumption [ AHR = 0.66 (0.50, 0.87) ] was found to delay significantly the rate of sputum smear conversion. Conclusion In our study, the median time of sputum smear conversion was with in the expected time frame of conversion. History of alcohol consumption was found to delay significantly the rate of sputum smear conversion. The DR-TB patients are strongly advised to avoid alcohol consumption."
https://openalex.org/W4220857122,"Pasture based systems enable cattle to express their natural behavior and are thus expected to provide better welfare than the majority of confinement systems. The aim of this study was to objectively measure locomotion activity of healthy dairy cattle kept on mountain pastures (n = 44) compared with cows kept in cubicle housing systems (n = 38). Selected cows were equipped with a validated 3D-accelerometer on one hind limb, and locomotion behavior was recorded for 48 hours. The 1-hour summaries of the variables lying time, walking time, standing bouts, walking bouts and number of strides were summed up to 24-hour summaries, and the means of the stride distance and stride duration were weighted by the variable number of strides. Mountain pasture cows had higher locomotor activity levels in comparison to cubicle cows. Mountain pasture cows spent less time lying down (528.1±109.5 min/day vs. 693.3±73.8 min/day; P<0.0001) and more time walking (75.6±25.9 min/day vs. 38.8±15.8 min/day; P <0.0001) than cubicle cows. Lying bout duration was longer in cubicle than in mountain pasture cows (90.9± 15.2 min/bout vs. 74.2 ± 21.1 min/bout; P = 0.0001), whilst the number of walking bouts was higher in mountain pasture cows than cubicle cows (199.1 ± 49.1 vs. 123.8 ± 43.8 bouts per day; P < 0.001). Likewise, the number of strides was higher in mountain pasture cows than cubicle cows (2040.5 ± 825.3 vs. 916.7 ± 408.6; P < 0.001). Mountain pasture cows had shorter stride duration (P < 0.0001) and shorter strides (P = 0.0002) than cubicle cows (1.8 ± 0.1 s/stride vs 2 ± 0.2 s/stride and 126.3 ± 18.1 vs 142.1 ± 17.8 m/stride, respectively). In summary, cows kept on mountain pasture were more active and spent longer than 12 hours / day standing. Lying markedly less than 12 hours per day seems to represent the normal behavior of pastured cows searching for fresh grass. This does not cause any obvious damage to the locomotor system as claws of cattle are well adapted to long periods of movement on mountain pastures."

However, the physiological underpinnings of the blood-pressure increase following uninephrectomy remain unclear. We hypothesized that changes in sympathetic tone or in parasympathetic modulation of sinus node function are involved in the blood-pressure increase following experimental kidney-mass reduction.C57BL6N mice (6 to 11 per group) subjected to sham surgery (controls) or uninephrectomy with or without a one-week course of sodium chloride-enriched, taurine-deficient diet were studied. Uninephrectomized mice treated with a subcutaneous infusion of angiotensin-II over a period of one week were positive controls. A transfemoral aortic catheter with telemetry unit was implanted, readings of heart-rate and blood-pressure were recorded. Powerspectral analysis of heart rate and systolic blood pressure was performed to gain surrogate parameters of sympathetictone and parasympathetic modulation of sinus node function. Baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate was determined from awake, unrestrained mice using spontaneous baroreflex gain technique.Systolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate and baroreflex sensitivity were not different in uninephrectomized mice when compared to controls. Parasympathetic modulation of sinus node function was less in uninephrectomized mice in comparison to controls. Uninephrectomized mice of the high-angiotensin-II model or of the high-salt and taurine-deficiency model had an increased systolic arterial blood pressure.Uninephrectomy associated with less parasympathetic modulation of sinus node function. The combination of uninephrectomy, taurine-deficiency and high-salt intake led to arterial hypertension."

Yet there remains uncertainty about the level of compliance with smoke-free public places.This study assesses the compliance with smoke-free laws in public places and the factors associated with active smoking in public places in Biratnagar Metropolitan City, Nepal.A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Biratnagar metropolitan city in Province 1 of Nepal from July to December 2019. A total of 725 public places within the metropolitan city were surveyed using a structured survey tool. Active smoking was the primary outcome of the study which was defined as smoking by any person during the data collection time at the designated public place.The overall compliance with smoke-free legislation was 56.4%. The highest compliance (75.0%) was observed in Government office buildings. The lowest compliance was observed in eateries, entertainment, and shopping venues (26.3%). There was a statistically significant association between active smoking and the presence of 'no smoking' notices appended at the entrance and the odds of active smoking in eateries, entertainment, hospitality, shopping venues, transportations and transits was higher compared to education and health care institutions. None of the 'no smoking' notices displayed fully adhered to the contents as prescribed by the law.As more than half of the public places complied with the requirements of the legislation, there was satisfactory overall compliance with the smoke-free public places law in this study. The public venues (eateries, shopping venues and transportations) that are more frequently visited and have a high turnover of the public have lower compliance with the legislation. The content of the message in the 'no smoking' notices needs close attention to adhere to the legal requirements."
https://openalex.org/W4220897713,"Even though the optimum sampling methods for invasive pests are very important in newly invaded areas, the standard sampling unit of Ricania shantungensis is still undeveloped in persimmons. Among all developmental stages of R. shantungensis, the egg has close relationship between its density and subsequent tree damage. Thus, this study was conducted to suggest an optimum sampling unit for R. shantungensis eggs in persimmons based on characteristics of its within-tree distribution pattern. The within-tree distribution pattern was characterized with 60 persimmon trees by cutting 12 branches at three vertical levels (low, middle, and high) in four horizontal criteria (east, west, south, and north) per tree. The sampling units were determined based on coefficient of variation (CV) and coefficient of determination (r2) calculated from egg mass numbers per 10 cm from the tip within a branch. In numbers of R. shantungensis egg masses, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) horizontally, but significant (P < 0.05) difference vertically. More R. shantungensis eggs were found on terminal branches of each trunk. The 60 cm from the tip of branches in the terminal positions of each trunk was selected as the optimum sampling unit for R. shantungensis in persimmons because this unit has the lowest CV value and more than 0.9 of r2 value. Even though the optimum sample number per tree should be determined field-specifically, it would be acceptable to sample two or three branches by considering this pests' recognizable damage level. This small sampling unit could make the sampling of R. shantungensis become more economical, precise, and consistent in persimmon fields."
https://openalex.org/W4220958762,"As of March 2021, three COVID-19 vaccines had been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Each has substantial efficacy in preventing COVID-19. However, as efficacy from trials was <100% for all three vaccines, disease in vaccinated people is expected to occur. We created a spreadsheet-based tool to estimate the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases among vaccinated people (vaccine breakthrough infections) based on published vaccine efficacy (VE) data, percent of the population that has been fully vaccinated, and average number of COVID-19 cases reported per day. We estimate that approximately 199,000 symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections (95% CI: ~183,000-214,000 cases) occurred in the United States during January-July 2021 among >156 million fully vaccinated people. With high SARS-CoV-2 transmission and increasing numbers of people vaccinated in the United States, vaccine breakthrough infections will continue to accumulate. Understanding expectations regarding number of vaccine breakthrough infections enables accurate public health messaging to help ensure that the occurrence of such cases does not negatively affect vaccine perceptions, confidence, and uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4220959141,"Concomitant liver cirrhosis is a crucial risk factor for major surgeries. However, only few data are available concerning cirrhotic patients requiring esophagectomy for malignant disease.From a prospectively maintained database of esophageal cancer patients, who underwent curative esophagectomy between 01/2012 and 01/2016, patients with concomitant liver cirrhosis (liver-cirrhotic patients, LCP) were compared to non-liver-cirrhotic patients (NLCP).Of 170 patients, 14 cirrhotic patients with predominately low MELD scores (≤ 9, 64.3%) were identified. Perioperative outcome was significantly worse for LCP, as proofed by 30-day (57.1% vs. 7.7, p<0.001) and 90-day mortality (64.3% vs. 9.6%, p<0.001), anastomotic leakage rate (64.3 vs. 22.3%, p = 0.002) and sepsis (57.1 vs. 21.5%, p = 0.006). Even after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities, and surgical approach, LCP revealed higher odds for 30-day and 90-day mortality compared to NLCP. Moreover, 5-year survival analysis showed a significantly poorer long-term outcome of LCP (p = 0.023). For risk stratification, none of the common cirrhosis scores proved prognostic impact, whereas components as Bilirubin (auROC 94.4%), INR (auROC = 90.0%), and preoperative ascites (p = 0.038) correlated significantly with the perioperative outcome.Curative esophagectomy for cirrhotic patients is associated with a dismal prognosis and should be evaluated critically. While MELD and Child score failed to predict perioperative mortality, Bilirubin and INR proofed excellent prognostic capacity in this cohort."
