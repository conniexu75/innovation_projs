Kwon et al. show that the peptides encoded by the expanded repeats in the C9orf72 gene interfere with the way cells make RNA and kill cells. These effects may account for how this genetic form of ALS causes disease. Working in Drosophila , Mizielinska et al. aimed to distinguish between the effects of repeat-containing RNAs and the dipeptide repeat peptides that they encode.

In patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a protein required for the survival of these neurons is deficient or missing altogether, so the neurons gradually die and the patients' muscles waste away. The disease is currently untreatable. Naryshkin et al. discovered small-molecule drugs that cause cells to produce the missing protein by altering how a specific mRNA is put together, or “spliced” (see the Perspective by Vigevani and Valcárcel). When the researchers used the drugs to treat diseased mice, the mice showed marked improvement in muscle mass, motor function, and survival. Science , this issue p. 688 ; see also p. 624"

This runoff lowers water quality and damages ecosystems. Although microbial nitrogen respiration influences the fate of nitrate, it is unclear which environmental factors exert the most control. Kraft et al. performed multiple long-term incubation studies of microbial communities from marine sediments. The relative supply of nitrate and nitrite, as well as total carbon and nitrogen, provided selective pressures that drove communities toward denitrification or ammonification. The average generation time of the community also strongly influenced which respiration pathway dominated. Science , this issue p. 676"

Here, we report that activated mouse macrophages lacking the IFN-stimulated gene cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) and that are unable to produce the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) overproduce inflammatory interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines. 25-HC acts by antagonizing sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP) processing to reduce Il1b transcription and to broadly repress IL-1-activating inflammasomes. In accord with these dual actions of 25-HC, Ch25h-deficient mice exhibit increased sensitivity to septic shock, exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and a stronger ability to repress bacterial growth. These findings identify an oxysterol, 25-HC, as a critical mediator in the negative-feedback pathway of IFN signaling on IL-1 family cytokine production and inflammasome activity."

Although different brain regions may specialize in storing different types of memories, computational and observational findings suggest that only a small portion of neurons within a given region is necessary to encode any particular memory (Guzowski et al., 1999Guzowski J.F.

For instance, it is generally agreed that the amygdala, in particular the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA), is important for auditory fear (Davis, 1992Davis M.

However, while over 70% of pyramidal/principal neurons in the rodent LA respond to both tone and shock presentation (suggesting these neurons are “correctly wired” and therefore eligible to become part of the memory trace), only a small portion (∼10%–30%) of these eligible neurons seem to be recruited into any one fear memory trace (Han et al., 2007Han J.H.

Postsynaptic receptor trafficking underlying a form of associative learning.Science. 2005; 308: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Similarly, there is evidence for a stable sparse fear memory trace in the human amygdala (Bach et al., 2011Bach D.R. Weiskopf N. Dolan R.J. A stable sparse fear memory trace in human amygdala.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9383-9389Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we examine the mechanisms that help determine which particular neurons are selected or allocated (Zhou et al., 2009Zhou Y. Won J. Karlsson M.G. Zhou M. Rogerson T. Balaji J. Neve R. Poirazi P. Silva A.J. CREB regulates excitability and the allocation of memory to subsets of neurons in the amygdala.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) to a sparsely encoded fear memory trace in the mouse LA. Previously, we and others showed that LA neurons compete against one another for allocation to a fear memory trace, and furthermore that it was possible to bias the outcome of this competition by manipulating CREB (cAMP/Ca2+ responsive element binding protein) function in individual LA neurons. Neurons with relatively higher CREB function were more likely to be included, whereas neurons with relatively lower CREB function were more likely to be excluded from the memory trace (Han et al., 2007Han J.H. Kushner S.A. Yiu A.P. Cole C.J. Matynia A. Brown R.A. Neve R.L. Guzowski J.F. Silva A.J. Josselyn S.A. Neuronal competition and selection during memory formation.Science. 2007; 316: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, Han et al., 2009Han J.H. Kushner S.A. Yiu A.P. Hsiang H.L. Buch T.

Won J. Karlsson M.G. Zhou M. Rogerson T. Balaji J. Neve R. Poirazi P. Silva A.J. CREB regulates excitability and the allocation of memory to subsets of neurons in the amygdala.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Importantly, the overall size of the LA memory trace remained stable despite these various CREB manipulations, and indeed did not vary with the strength of the fear memory. This suggests that there is a limit or constraint on the overall size of the LA fear memory trace. Interestingly, decreasing CREB function in a small population of random LA neurons did not disrupt memory formation. This result is likely because the small population of neurons with decreased CREB function was excluded from the memory trace (which was composed of nonmanipulated neurons). In contrast, increasing CREB function in a similar small portion of LA neurons was sufficient to enhance memory formation (Han et al., 2007Han J.H. Kushner S.A. Yiu A.P. Cole C.J. Matynia A. Brown R.A. Neve R.L. Guzowski J.F. Silva A.J. Josselyn S.A. Neuronal competition and selection during memory formation.Science. 2007; 316: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that neuronal competition is important for neuronal allocation and memory formation, and that neurons with relatively higher CREB are competitively advantaged (and therefore, more likely to “win” this competition). CREB is a ubiquitous transcription factor implicated in many diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, apoptosis, differentiation, metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and neuronal excitability (Lonze and Ginty, 2002Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Function and regulation of CREB family transcription factors in the nervous system.Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). For instance, CREB bidirectionally modulates neuronal excitability (increasing CREB function increases the propensity of neurons to fire action potentials, while decreasing CREB function decreases neuronal excitability) (Dong et al., 2006Dong Y. Green T. Saal D. Marie H. Neve R. Nestler E.J. Malenka R.C. CREB modulates excitability of nucleus accumbens neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, Viosca et al., 2009Viosca J. Lopez de Armentia M. Jancic D. Barco A. Enhanced CREB-dependent gene expression increases the excitability of neurons in the basal amygdala and primes the consolidation of contextual and cued fear memory.Learn. Mem. 2009; 16: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2009Zhou Y. Won J. Karlsson M.G. Zhou M. Rogerson T. Balaji J. Neve R. Poirazi P. Silva A.J. CREB regulates excitability and the allocation of memory to subsets of neurons in the amygdala.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Which of these CREB-mediated processes is important for neuronal allocation during memory formation? One plausible mechanism is that neurons with high levels of CREB are preferentially recruited to a memory trace because these neurons are more excitable than their neighbors (a postsynaptic neuron that is more excitable than its neighbor would be “primed” for allocation into a given memory trace). Although an increase in excitability has been proposed as a mechanism mediating neuronal allocation during memory formation (Kim et al., 2013Kim D. Pare D. Nair S.S. Assignment of model amygdala neurons to the fear memory trace depends on competitive synaptic interactions.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 14354-14358Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2009Zhou Y. Won J. Karlsson M.G. Zhou M. Rogerson T. Balaji J. Neve R. Poirazi P. Silva A.J. CREB regulates excitability and the allocation of memory to subsets of neurons in the amygdala.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), this idea has not been directly tested experimentally. Here we used three different methods to determine whether relatively higher excitability before training confers a competitive advantage for neuronal allocation to a fear memory. To manipulate excitability in a small, arbitrarily chosen subpopulation of LA neurons, we used replication-defective herpes simplex viral (HSV) vectors. To phenotype the type of LA cells infected by HSV, we microinjected mice with HSV expressing GFP (to allow for easy visualization of infected cells) into the LA and performed immunohistochemistry for different cell markers (NeuN, neuronal nuclei, as a marker of neurons; αCaMKII, alpha Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, as a marker of excitatory pyramidal/principal neurons; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein, as a marker of astrocytes; and GAD67, glutamate decarboxylase 67, as a marker of inhibitory neurons). We observed complete overlap between LA cells infected by HSV (GFP+) and cells expressing a neuronal marker (NeuN+), but no overlap between infected cells and cells expressing GFAP, confirming that HSV is neurotropic (Cole et al., 2012Cole C.J. Mercaldo V. Restivo L. Yiu A.P. Sekeres M.J. Han J.H. Vetere G. Pekar T. Ross P.J. Neve R.L. et al.MEF2 negatively regulates learning-induced structural plasticity and memory formation.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Fink et al., 1996Fink D.J. DeLuca N.A. Goins W.F. Glorioso J.C. Gene transfer to neurons using herpes simplex virus-based vectors.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 265-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, HSV predominantly (∼98%) infected pyramidal/principal excitatory (αCaMKII+) neurons in the LA, with only a very small number (<2%) of infected neurons costaining with the inhibitory neuronal marker GAD67 (Figures 1A and 1B ). Therefore, consistent with previous reports, we found that following microinjection into the LA, HSV preferentially infects pyramidal/principal neurons (Cole et al., 2012Cole C.J. Mercaldo V. Restivo L. Yiu A.P. Sekeres M.J. Han J.H. Vetere G. Pekar T. Ross P.J. Neve R.L. et al.MEF2 negatively regulates learning-induced structural plasticity and memory formation.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because of this tropism, we used HSV to manipulate excitability in a portion of pyramidal/principal neurons in the LA. Neuronal excitability is determined by the composition, distribution, and properties of ion channels (e.g., Na+, K+, and Ca2+) in the plasma membrane. Increasing CREB function increases neuronal excitability, in part, by decreasing voltage-gated K+ currents (Dong et al., 2006Dong Y. Green T. Saal D. Marie H. Neve R. Nestler E.J. Malenka R.C.

CREB regulates excitability and the allocation of memory to subsets of neurons in the amygdala.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). This, in turn, inhibits the postburst afterhyperpolarization (AHP, a hyperpolarizing current which mediates the “undershoot phase” or refractory period following an action potential). Two members of the voltage-dependent K+ family of channels, KCNQ2 and related KCNQ3, help mediate the AHP and function as molecular brakes on neuron firing (Delmas and Brown, 2005Delmas P. Brown D.A.

Physiol. 2005; 566: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant-negative KCNQ2 mutant (hQ2-G279S; dnKCNQ2) coassembles with native KCNQ2/3 subunits, disrupts their function, and thereby increases neuronal excitability (Peters et al., 2005Peters H.C.

Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability due to dominant-negative KCNQ2 mutations.Neurology. 2007; 69: 2045-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We observed that LA neurons in adult mice endogenously express KCNQ2-containing channels (Figure 1C), suggesting that expression of the dnKCNQ2 construct could be a viable method for increasing excitability in LA neurons. To test this, we first transfected primary hippocampal neurons with the dnKCNQ2 construct. The dnKCNQ2 construct was also observed near the axon initial segment (Figure 1D), consistent with the notion that dnKCNQ2 coassembles with, and blocks the function of, endogenous KCNQ2/3 channels. Therefore, as our first method to increase excitability without directly manipulating CREB function, we used HSV vectors to express dnKCNQ2. To decrease excitability without directly decreasing CREB function, we used HSV to express Kir2.1, an inwardly rectifying K+ channel, which reduces neuronal input resistance and decreases evoked action potential firing (Dong et al., 2006Dong Y.

To verify that expression of our excitability constructs indeed manipulated neuronal excitability, we assessed excitability (as measured by firing rate) of cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with GFP, CREB, dnKCNQ2, Kir2.1, and CREB+Kir2.1 constructs. Consistent with previous reports, we found that expression of dnKCNQ2 (Peters et al., 2005Peters H.C. Hu H. Pongs O. Storm J.F. Isbrandt D.

Moreover, the CREB-induced increase in excitability was blocked by coexpression with Kir2.1 in the same neurons (Figure 2A; one-way ANOVA on firing rate of transfected/not-transfected neurons with between-group factor Transgene [GFP, CREB, dnKCNQ2, Kir2.1, and CREB+Kir2.1], F4,28 = 7.18, p < 0.001, posthoc Newman-Keuls tests showed that dnKCNQ2 and CREB increased excitability over GFP, whereas CREB+Kir2.1 condition was not different from GFP). To confirm that HSV-CREB and HSV-dnKCNQ2 increased excitability in infected LA neurons, we also assessed excitability in ex vivo LA slices following microinjection of HSV expressing GFP, CREB, or dnKCNQ2 into mice. LA neurons overexpressing dnKCNQ2 or CREB showed higher firing rates than LA neurons expressing GFP (Figure 2B; one-way ANOVA conducted on firing rate of infected/not-infected neurons with between-group factor Vector (GFP, CREB, and dnKCNQ2), F2,21 = 4.15, p < 0.05, LSD posthoc tests showed that both neurons with dnKCNQ2 or CREB fired more action potentials than neurons expressing GFP and did not differ from each other). Therefore, although we did not directly determine excitability following our manipulations in vivo, results from cell culture and ex vivo LA neuron slices confirm previous reports that dnKCNQ2 and CREB enhance excitability. We previously showed that increasing CREB function in a small, random population of LA neurons by microinjecting HSV-CREB was sufficient to enhance conditioned fear memory formation, and that these neurons overexpressing CREB were selectively allocated to the fear memory trace (Han et al., 2007Han J.H.

To examine if the memory-enhancing effects of CREB overexpression in these experiments could be attributed to CREB increasing neuronal excitability, we microinjected HSV vectors expressing GFP (as a control), CREB (to increase excitability), dnKCNQ2 (to increase excitability), Kir2.1 (to decrease excitability), or CREB+Kir2.1 (to counteract the increase in excitability produced by CREB) into the LA 2 days before weak auditory fear conditioning (in which a tone conditioned stimulus [CS] was paired with low-intensity, 0.3 mA shock). Importantly, following microinjection, these viral microinjections infect roughly 10% of LA principal neurons (as determined by stereological counting), and the pattern of infection appears random (Figure 2C; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In agreement with previous findings (Han et al., 2007Han J.H. Kushner S.A. Yiu A.P. Cole C.J. Matynia A. Brown R.A. Neve R.L. Guzowski J.F. Silva A.J. Josselyn S.A.

CREB regulates excitability and the allocation of memory to subsets of neurons in the amygdala.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we observed that increasing CREB in a small portion of LA neurons enhanced memory formation (Figure 2D). Similarly, expressing dnKCNQ2 in roughly 10% of LA neurons produced a memory enhancement that was strikingly similar to that observed following CREB overexpression. However, coexpression of CREB and Kir2.1 in the same LA neurons blocked the memory enhancement produced by CREB vector alone (one-way ANOVA, F4,42 = 14.75, p < 0.001, mice microinjected with CREB or dnKCNQ2 vector froze more than mice with GFP vector, but were not different from each other; mice microinjected with CREB+Kir2.1 vector froze less than mice with CREB vector alone, but were not different from mice with GFP vector [posthoc Newman-Keuls]). These results suggest that increasing excitability in a small portion of LA neurons before fear conditioning enhanced the formation of a fear memory. To more thoroughly examine this effect, we conducted a series of control experiments. First, we examined the phase of memory which was important in the memory enhancement produced by CREB or dnKCNQ2 expression. To determine whether the higher freezing during the tone test observed in mice microinjected with HSV-CREB or HSV-dnKCNQ2 was due to an effect on acquisition or expression of conditioned fear memory, we microinjected our viral vectors 1 day after training (rather than 2 days before training). As a control for the possible effects of surgery, we compared freezing levels on the test day to no-surgery control mice. We observed that microinjecting our viral vectors 1 day after either weak (0.3 mA shock) or strong (0.6 mA shock) training did not affect freezing levels during the tone test (Figure 3A; strong training, F3,36 = 0.52, p > 0.05; weak training, F3,28 = 0.81, p > 0.05). These findings indicate that increasing excitability in a small subset of LA neurons did not increase freezing by enhancing the expression of a previously acquired fear memory. Instead, these results are consistent with the interpretation that CREB and dnKCNQ2 enhanced the formation of a fear memory. Second, we asked when an increase in neuronal excitability resulted in enhanced fear memory. Transgene expression using this HSV system begins hours following microinjection, peaks within 2–3 days later, and dissipates within 7–12 days (Figure 3B, right) (Sekeres et al., 2012Sekeres M.J. Mercaldo V. Richards B. Sargin D. Mahadevan V. Woodin M.A. Frankland P.W. Josselyn S.A. Increasing CRTC1 function in the dentate gyrus during memory formation or reactivation increases memory strength without compromising memory quality.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 17857-17868Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this transgene expression time course by microinjecting CREB or dnKCNQ2 vectors 11 days before training (such that mice were trained at a time when the transgenes were no longer expressed). Microinjecting dnKCNQ2 or CREB vector 11 days before training had no effect on subsequent memory formation, suggesting that the enhanced memory was dependent on increased neuronal excitability at the time of training (Figure 3B, left; F2,20 = 0.09, p > 0.05). Third, we examined the duration of memory enhancement produced by CREB or dnKCNQ2 vector. We found that the memory enhancement produced by high levels of CREB or dnKCNQ2 at the time of training (mice were microinjected with vectors 2 days before training) was enduring and even continued beyond transgene expression (14 days after microinjection) (Figure 3C; F2,21 = 8.44, p < 0.05, mice microinjected with CREB or dnKCNQ2 vector continued to freeze higher than mice microinjected with GFP vector [but did not differ from each other] even 14 days following microinjection [Newman-Keuls]). Finally, we examined the anatomical specificity of the memory enhancement induced by overexpression of CREB. To this end, we microinjected CREB vector into the neighboring basal amygdala (BA) or central amygdala (CeA) 2 days prior to training. We observed no memory enhancement with CREB overexpression in these neighboring amygdala nuclei (Figure 3D; one-way ANOVA conducted on three groups, GFP vector in LA, CREB vector in CeA, or CREB vector in BA, F2,20 = 2.58, p > 0.05), suggesting that the memory-enhancing effects of CREB overexpression are anatomically specific. Together, these results indicate memory formation was enhanced if, and only if, CREB or dnKCNQ2 was expressed in a small population of LA neurons at the time of training. Once formed, however, this enhanced memory endured and no longer required continued overexpression of CREB or dnKCNQ2. Although we observed no difference in baseline (pretone) freezing in our experiments (Figures S1A–S1D available online), we next asked whether increasing excitability in a small portion of LA neurons enhanced freezing during the tone test by nonspecifically increasing overall basal anxiety-like behavior. We microinjected CREB or dnKCNQ2 vector into the LA 2 days before testing in the open field (Figure 4A) or"
https://openalex.org/W2080478852,"The serotonin system powerfully modulates physiology and behavior in health and disease, yet the circuit mechanisms underlying serotonin neuron activity are poorly understood. The major source of forebrain serotonergic innervation is from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), which contains both serotonin and GABA neurons. Using viral tracing combined with electrophysiology, we found that GABA and serotonin neurons in the DR receive excitatory, inhibitory, and peptidergic inputs from the same specific brain regions. Embedded in this overall similarity are important differences. Serotonin neurons are more likely to receive synaptic inputs from anterior neocortex while GABA neurons receive disproportionally higher input from the central amygdala. Local input mapping revealed extensive serotonin-serotonin as well as GABA-serotonin connectivity with a distinct spatial organization. Covariance analysis suggests heterogeneity of both serotonin and GABA neurons with respect to the inputs they receive. These analyses provide a foundation for further functional dissection of the serotonin system."

Auxin and cytokinin are both critical for division and patterning, but it is unknown how these hormones converge upon tissue development. We identify a genetic network that reinforces an early embryonic bias in auxin distribution to create a local, nonresponding cytokinin source within the root vascular tissue. Experimental and theoretical evidence shows that these cells act as a tissue organizer by positioning the domain of oriented cell divisions. We further demonstrate that the auxin-cytokinin interaction acts as a spatial incoherent feed-forward loop, which is essential to generate distinct hormonal response zones, thus establishing a stable pattern within a growing vascular tissue."

We reconstructed variations in the extent of North Pacific anoxia since 1850 using a geochemical proxy for denitrification (δ 15 N) from multiple sediment cores. Increasing δ 15 N since ~1990 records an expansion of anoxia, consistent with observed O 2 trends. However, this was preceded by a longer declining δ 15 N trend that implies that the anoxic zone was shrinking for most of the 20th century. Both periods can be explained by changes in winds over the tropical Pacific that drive upwelling, biological productivity, and O 2 demand within the OMZ. If equatorial Pacific winds resume their predicted weakening trend, the ocean’s largest anoxic zone will contract despite a global O 2 decline."

We have shown previously that ATP release and autocrine purinergic signaling via P2Y2 receptors are essential for PMN activation. Here we show that mitochondria provide the ATP that initiates PMN activation. Stimulation of formyl peptide receptors increases the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and triggers a rapid burst of ATP release from PMNs. This burst of ATP release can be blocked by inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP production and requires an initial formyl peptide receptor-induced Ca(2+) signal that triggers mitochondrial activation. The burst of ATP release generated by the mitochondria fuels a first phase of purinergic signaling that boosts Ca(2+) signaling, amplifies mitochondrial ATP production, and initiates functional PMN responses. Cells then switch to glycolytic ATP production, which fuels a second round of purinergic signaling that sustains Ca(2+) signaling via P2X receptor-mediated Ca(2+) influx and maintains functional PMN responses such as oxidative burst, degranulation, and phagocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1998275595,"Hsp90 binding immunophilins FKBP51 and FKBP52 modulate steroid receptor trafficking and hormone-dependent biological responses. With the purpose to expand this model to other nuclear factors that are also subject to nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, we analyzed whether these immunophilins modulate NF-κB signaling. It is demonstrated that FKBP51 impairs both the nuclear translocation rate of NF-κB and its transcriptional activity. The inhibitory action of FKBP51 requires neither the peptidylprolyl-isomerase activity of the immunophilin nor its association with Hsp90. The TPR domain of FKBP51 is essential. On the other hand, FKBP52 favors the nuclear retention time of RelA, its association to a DNA consensus binding sequence, and NF-κB transcriptional activity, the latter effect being strongly dependent on the peptidylprolyl-isomerase activity and also on the TPR domain of FKBP52, but its interaction with Hsp90 is not required. In unstimulated cells, FKBP51 forms endogenous complexes with cytoplasmic RelA. Upon cell stimulation with phorbol ester, the NF-κB soluble complex exchanges FKBP51 for FKBP52, and the NF-κB biological effect is triggered. Importantly, FKBP52 is functionally recruited to the promoter region of NF-κB target genes, whereas FKBP51 is released. Competition assays demonstrated that both immunophilins antagonize one another, and binding assays with purified proteins suggest that the association of RelA and immunophilins could be direct. These observations suggest that the biological action of NF-κB in different cell types could be positively regulated by a high FKBP52/FKBP51 expression ratio by favoring NF-κB nuclear retention, recruitment to the promoter regions of target genes, and transcriptional activity."

To shed light on the underlying mechanism, we orally administered BPA (4 nM to 400 μM in drinking water) to 8-wk-old CD11 mice over 30 d. Mice developed dosage-dependent high blood pressure (systolic 130 ± 12 vs. 170 ± 12 mmHg; EC50 0.4 μM), impairment of acetylcholine (AcH)-induced carotid relaxation (0.66 ± 0.08 vs. 0.44 ± 0.1 mm), a 1.7-fold increase in arterial angiotensin II (AngII), an 8.7-fold increase in eNOS mRNA and protein, and significant eNOS-dependent superoxide and peroxynitrite accumulation. AngII inhibition with 0.5 mg/ml losartan reduced oxidative stress and normalized blood pressure and endothelium-dependent relaxation, which suggests that AngII uncouples eNOS and contributes to the BPA-induced endothelial dysfunction by promoting oxidative and nitrosative stress. Microarray analysis of mouse aortic endothelial cells revealed a 2.5-fold increase in expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-α (CaMKII-α) in response to 10 nM BPA, with increased expression of phosphorylated-CaMKII-α in carotid rings of BPA-exposed mice, whereas CaMKII-α inhibition with 100 nM autocamptide-2-related inhibitor peptide (AIP) reduced BPA-mediated increase of superoxide. Administration of CaMKII-α inhibitor KN 93 reduced BPA-induced blood pressure and carotid blood velocity in mice, and reverted BPA-mediated carotid constriction in response to treatment with AcH.

The concomitant use of fungistatic drugs and the lack of cidal drugs frequently result in strains that could withstand commonly used antifungals, and display multidrug resistance (MDR). In search of novel fungicidals, in this study, we have explored a plant alkaloid berberine (BER) for its antifungal potential. For this, we screened an in-house transcription factor (TF) mutant library of C. albicans strains towards their susceptibility to BER. Our screen of TF mutant strains identified a heat shock factor (HSF1), which has a central role in thermal adaptation, to be most responsive to BER treatment. Interestingly, HSF1 mutant was not only highly susceptible to BER but also displayed collateral susceptibility towards drugs targeting cell wall (CW) and ergosterol biosynthesis. Notably, BER treatment alone could affect the CW integrity as was evident from the growth retardation of MAP kinase and calcineurin pathway null mutant strains and transmission electron microscopy. However, unlike BER, HSF1 effect on CW appeared to be independent of MAP kinase and Calcineurin pathway genes. Additionally, unlike hsf1 null strain, BER treatment of Candida cells resulted in dysfunctional mitochondria, which was evident from its slow growth in non-fermentative carbon source and poor labeling with mitochondrial membrane potential sensitive probe. This phenotype was reinforced with an enhanced ROS levels coinciding with the up-regulated oxidative stress genes in BER-treated cells. Together, our study not only describes the molecular mechanism of BER fungicidal activity but also unravels a new role of evolutionary conserved HSF1, in MDR of Candida."

https://openalex.org/W2112167480,"The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays a crucial role in regulation of glucose homoeostasis in mammalian cells. PDC flux depends on catalytic activity of the most important enzyme component pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH kinase inactivates PDC by phosphorylating PDH at specific serine residues, including Ser-293, whereas dephosphorylation of PDH by PDH phosphatase restores PDC activity. The current understanding suggests that Ser-293 phosphorylation of PDH impedes active site accessibility to its substrate pyruvate. Here, we report that phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue Tyr-301 also inhibits PDH α 1 (PDHA1) by blocking pyruvate binding through a novel mechanism in addition to Ser-293 phosphorylation. In addition, we found that multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylate PDHA1 at Tyr-301, and Tyr-301 phosphorylation of PDHA1 is common in EGF-stimulated cells as well as diverse human cancer cells and primary leukemia cells from human patients. Moreover, expression of a phosphorylation-deficient PDHA1 Y301F mutant in cancer cells resulted in increased oxidative phosphorylation, decreased cell proliferation under hypoxia, and reduced tumor growth in mice.

Pre-emptive and repeated administration of minocycline (30 mg/kg, i.p.) over 7 days significantly reduced allodynia and hyperalgesia as measured on day 7 after CCI. The antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of intrathecally (i.t.) administered morphine (10-20 µg), DAMGO (1-2 µg) and U50,488H (25-50 µg) were significantly potentiated in rats after minocycline, but no such changes were observed after DPDPE (10-20 µg), deltorphin II (1.5-15 µg) and SNC80 (10-20 µg) administration. Additionally, nerve injury-induced down-regulation of all types of opioid receptors in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia was not influenced by minocycline, which indicates that the effects of opioid ligands are dependent on other changes, presumably neuroimmune interactions. Our study of rat primary microglial cell culture using qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of mu-opioid receptors (MOR) and kappa-opioid receptors (KOR), further we provide the first evidence for the lack of DOR on microglial cells. In summary, DOR analgesia is different from analgesia induced by MOR and KOR receptors because it does not dependent on injury-induced microglial activation.

Multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess whether loneliness, marital status, relationship satisfaction, advice from others than partner, and cohesion at work is associated with consumption of sodas and juices.Perceived loneliness was associated with elevated intake of all sugary beverages, while relationship satisfaction was negatively associated with all sugary beverages. Being married or cohabitating, having supportive friends, and having a sense of togetherness at work were associated with lower intake of two out of three sugar-containing beverages. These associations were significant, even after controlling for factors such as body mass index, weight related self-image, depression, physical activity, educational level, age and income. In comparison, a statistically significant relationship emerged between relationship satisfaction and artificially sweetened cola. No other predictor variables were significantly associated with any type of artificially sweetened beverage.This study indicates that loneliness and social integration influence the level of consumption of sugary beverages.

Participants completed Revised Child PTSD Symptom Scale and Sleep Problems Subscale of Self-generated Child Behavior Problems Questionnaire at one year (T1), one-and-a-half years (T2), two years (T3) after the earthquake, respectively. Results There was a bidirectional relationship between intrusive symptom clusters of PTSD and sleep problems from T1 to T2, and this relationship became non-significant from T2 to T3. There was a one-way predictive relationship of avoidance symptom clusters of PTSD onto sleep problems from T1 to T3. The hyperarousal symptom clusters of PTSD had effects on sleep problems from T1 to T2 but not from T2 to T3, while sleep problems have no significant effect on hyperarousal symptom clusters of PTSD from T1 to T3. In addition, the relationships between three symptom clusters of PTSD and sleep problems weakened with time change. Conclusions From 1 year to 1.5 years after the earthquake, all the three symptom clusters of PTSD could be important predictive factors for the development and maintenance of sleep problems, while sleep problems could only be risk factors for the intrusive symptom clusters of PTSD. From 1.5 years to 2 years, only the avoidance symptom clusters of PTSD were risk factors for sleep problems, and sleep problems had no significant effects on any symptom clusters of PTSD. Overall, the relationship between PTSD and sleep problems weakened with time change."

Clinical, microbiological, demographic as well as outcome and laboratory data was collected.Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently isolated pathogens. While Streptococcus spp. and Escherichia coli were isolated more frequently in patients with community-onset BSI, Enterococcus spp., Candida spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated more frequently among those with hospital-acquired BSI. With regard to the outcome, 30-day (82/395 vs. 31/277; p = 0.001) and 90-day mortality (106/395 vs. 35/277; p<0.001) was significantly higher among patients with hospital-acquired BSI even though these patients were significantly younger. Also, hospital-acquired BSI remained a significant predictor of mortality in multivariable analysis. At the time the blood cultures were drawn, patients with community-onset BSI had significantly higher leukocyte counts, neutrophil-leucocyte ratios as well as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin-6 and serum creatinine levels when compared to those with hospital-acquired BSI. Patients with healthcare-associated BSI presented with significantly higher PCT and creatinine levels than those with community-acquired BSI.Hospital-acquired BSI was associated with significantly higher 30- and 90-day mortality rates. Hospital-acquired BSI therefore poses an important target for the most aggressive strategies for prevention and infection control."
https://openalex.org/W2147682199,"Cigarette smoke (CS) induces inflammatory responses characterized by increase of immune cells and cytokine release. Remodeling processes, such as mucus hypersecretion and extracellular matrix protein production, are also directly or indirectly induced by CS. Recently, we showed that activation of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) attenuates CS extract-induced interleukin (IL)-8 release from cultured airway smooth muscle cells. Using an acute, short-term model of CS exposure, we now studied the role of Epac1, Epac2, and the Epac effector phospholipase-Cε (PLCε) in airway inflammation and remodeling in vivo. Compared to wild-type mice exposed to CS, the number of total inflammatory cells, macrophages, and neutrophils and total IL-6 release was lower in Epac2(-/-) mice, which was also the case for neutrophils and IL-6 in PLCε(-/-) mice. Taken together, Epac2, acting partly via PLCε, but not Epac1, enhances CS-induced airway inflammation in vivo. In total lung homogenates of Epac1(-/-) mice, MUC5AC and matrix remodeling parameters (transforming growth factor-β1, collagen I, and fibronectin) were increased at baseline. Our findings suggest that Epac1 primarily is capable of inhibiting remodeling processes, whereas Epac2 primarily increases inflammatory processes in vivo."

In this study, we used zebrafish to investigate whether the fish homologs of GRK2 and -5, Grk2/3 and Grk5, also have unique, complementary, or competitive roles during heart development. We found that they differentially regulate the heart rate of early embryos and equally facilitate heart function in older embryos and that both are required to develop proper cardiac morphology. A loss of Grk2/3 results in dilated atria and hypoplastic ventricles, and the hearts of embryos depleted in Grk5 present with a generalized atrophy. This Grk5 morphant phenotype was associated with an overall decrease of early cardiac progenitors as well as a reduction in the area occupied by myocardial progenitor cells. In the case of Grk2/3, the progenitor decrease was confined to a subset of precursor cells with a committed ventricular fate. We attempted to rescue the GRK loss-of-function heart phenotypes by downstream activation of Hedgehog signaling. The Grk2/3 loss-of-function embryos were rescued by this approach, but Grk5 embryos failed to respond.

https://openalex.org/W2044096635,"Smokers are subject to being more susceptible to the long-term effects of silica dust, whilst it remains unclear whether the joint effect of smoking and silicosis differs amongst diseases to the lungs; this study aims to address this knowledge gap. This was a historical cohort study comprised of 3202 silicotics in Hong Kong during 1981-2005 who were followed up till 31/12/2006. We estimated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) in the smoking and never smoking silicotics using the mortality rates of male general population indiscriminately by smoking status, but these SMRs were regarded as biased. We adjusted these biased SMRs using ""smoking adjustment factors (SAF)"". We assessed the multiplicative interaction between smoking and silicosis using 'relative silicosis effect (RSE)' that was the ratio of SAF-corrected SMR of smoking silicotics to the never smokers. A RSE differs significantly from one implies the presence of multiplicative interaction. A significant excess SMR was observed for respiratory diseases (lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [COPD], silicosis) and other diseases to the lungs (pulmonary heart disease, tuberculosis). All the 'biased-SMRs' in smokers were higher than those in never smokers, but the SAF-corrected SMRs became higher in never smokers. The RSE was 0.95 (95%CI: 0.37-3.55), 0.94 (95%CI: 0.42-2.60), and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.60-1.19) for lung cancer, COPD, and silicosis; whilst it was 1.21 (95%CI: 0.32-10.26) for tuberculosis and 1.02 (95%CI: 0.16-42.90) for pulmonary heart disease. This study firstly demonstrated the joint effect of smoking and silicosis may differ amongst diseases to the lungs, but power is limited."

The Chinese tree shrew is considered to be a realistic candidate model. To assess the potential of the Chinese tree shrew for pharmacological testing, we performed drug target prediction and analysis on genomic and transcriptomic scales. Using our pipeline, 3,482 proteins were predicted to be drug targets. Of these predicted targets, 446 and 1,049 proteins with the highest rank and total scores, respectively, included homologs of targets for cancer chemotherapy, depression, age-related decline and cardiovascular disease. Based on comparative analyses, more than half of drug target proteins identified from the tree shrew genome were shown to be higher similarity to human targets than in the mouse. Target validation also demonstrated that the constitutive expression of the proteinase-activated receptors of tree shrew platelets is similar to that of human platelets but differs from that of mouse platelets. We developed an effective pipeline and search strategy for drug target prediction and the evaluation of model-based target identification for drug testing. This work provides useful information for future studies of the Chinese tree shrew as a source of novel targets for drug discovery research."

Thus, we aimed to investigate whether other DIO2 polymorphisms, individually or in combination with the Thr92Ala, may contribute to IR. The entire coding-region of DIO2 gene was sequenced in 12 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Potentially informative variants were evaluated in 1077 T2DM patients and 516 nondiabetic subjects. IR was evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index. DIO2 gene sequencing revealed no new mutation but 5 previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We observed that all T2DM patients displaying high HOMA-IR index (n = 6) were homozygous for the rs225017 (T/A) polymorphism. Further analysis showed that the median fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR of T2DM patients carrying the T/T genotype were higher than in patients carrying the A allele (P = 0.013 and P = 0.002, respectively). These associations were magnified in the presence of the Ala92Ala genotype of the Thr92Ala polymorphism. Moreover, the rs225017 and the Thr92Ala polymorphisms were in partial linkage disequilibrium (|D′| = 0.811; r2 = 0.365). In conclusion, the rs225017 polymorphism is associated with greater IR in T2DM and it seems to interact with the Thr92Ala polymorphism in the modulation of IR."
https://openalex.org/W2051721647,"Introduction The culture-negative conversion rate of sputum after 2 months of treatment in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is used as a reliable surrogate marker for relapse after completion of treatment. We hypothesized that culture conversion of sputum at 2 months of anti-TB treatment and the time to culture conversion are different among pulmonary TB patients who are diagnosed using different methods. Methods Culture-confirmed pulmonary TB patients who were diagnosed between 1 January, 2011 and 31 December, 2012 were classified into three groups based on the diagnostic method that prompted treatment initiation: positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining of sputum (smear-positive group), negative AFB staining, but Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from sputum (culture-positive group), and positive AFB staining, positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. tuberculosis, or culture of M. tuberculosis from a bronchoscopic specimen (bronchoscopy group). Rates of negative mycobacterial culture conversion at 2 months of anti-TB treatment and the time to negative culture conversion of sputum were compared among the three groups. Results A total of 203 patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB were included in the final analysis. TB patients in the culture-positive group (94.1%) and the bronchoscopy group (97.6%) showed a higher culture conversion rate at 2 months of treatment than those in the smear-positive group (78.7%, P = 0.001). Additionally, the time to culture conversion was longer in the smear-positive group (median, 40 days) than in the culture-positive (median, 19 days; P = 0.009) and bronchoscopy groups (median, 29 days; P = 0.004). Conclusions The higher culture conversion rate at 2 months and the shorter time to culture conversion among pulmonary TB patients with a negative AFB smear suggests the feasibility of shortening treatment duration and isolation in these patients."

Here, we show that although pyruvate is a weak activator by itself, it synergically enhances the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate activation. They increase the enzyme affinity for each other, and the combination increases Vmax, substrate apparent affinity, and decreases AMP inhibition. Our results indicate that there are two distinct interacting allosteric sites for activation. Hence, pyruvate modulates E. coli glycogen metabolism by orchestrating a functional network of allosteric regulators. We postulate that this novel dual activator mechanism increases the evolvability of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and its related metabolic control."

However, the structural determinants required for HP1α localization in interphase and the regulation of HP1α dynamics have remained elusive. Here we show that centromeric localization of HP1α depends on histone H3 Lys-9 trimethyltransferase SUV39H1 activity in interphase but not in mitotic cells. Surprisingly, HP1α liberates from chromosome arms in early mitosis. To test the role of this dissociation, we engineered an HP1α construct that persistently localizes to chromosome arms. Interestingly, persistent localization of HP1α to chromosome arms perturbs accurate kinetochore-microtubule attachment due to an aberrant distribution of chromosome passenger complex and Sgo1 from centromeres to chromosome arms that prevents resolution of sister chromatids. Further analyses showed that Mis14 and perhaps other PXVXL-containing proteins are involved in directing localization of HP1α to the centromere in mitosis.

Reports concerning their association with long-term outcome after an ACS are equivocal. The aim of our study was to investigate the association of the 9p21.3 locus with 5-year overall mortality in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively in 2 independent registries of consecutive patients with STEMI (derivation and validation group). Genotyping was performed with the TaqMan method. The analyzed end-point was total mortality.The derivation group comprised 589 patients: 25.3% female (n = 149), mean age 62.4 ± 12.0 years, total 5-year mortality 16.6% (n = 98). When all the study group was analyzed, no significant differences in mortality were found between the genotypes. However, in high-risk patients (GRACE risk score ≥ 155 points, n = 238), homozygotes associated with higher risk for ACS had significantly better 5-year survival compared to other genotypes. The hazard ratio associated with the high-risk genotype (a homozygote of high risk for ACS or a heterozygote) was: HR = 2.2 (1.15-4.2) for the rs10757278 polymorphism, HR = 2.7 (95% CI 1.3-5.4) for the rs4977574 one and HR = 2.3 (1.2-4.5) for the rs1333049 one (Cox proportional hazards model). Survival analysis in the validation group (n = 365) showed a clear trend towards better prognosis in GG homozygotes of the rs10757278 SNP, which confirms our initial results (p = 0.09, log-rank test).The 9p21.3 locus is associated with 5-year mortality in high-risk patients with STEMI. The genotypes associated with higher risk for ACS show a protective effect in terms of further survival (instead of a deteriorating prognosis, as reported previously). This finding, due to the very high size of the effect, could potentially be applied to clinical practice, if appropriate methods are elaborated."

Despite serotonin’s involvement in many essential behaviors, the precise circuit connectivity that regulates serotonin-producing neurons remains poorly understood.

All three studies used modified GFP-encoding rabies virus pseudotyped with an avian envelop protein, which only transduces neurons that express a cognate receptor (TVA receptor), to target the initial entry of rabies viral particles to genetically defined raphe cell types (Wickersham et al., 2007Wickersham I.R.

In addition to providing a comprehensive data set of brain-wide inputs to these distinct dorsal raphe cell types, this study also utilized two different forms of the TVA receptor in order to optimize their anatomical tracing at both the distal and local level. The first form was the traditional TVA receptor (TCB), which is highly efficient for long-range tracing but can significantly increase background labeling at the initial site of viral transduction. The second form was a mutated TVA receptor (TC66T), which decreases transsynaptic spread of the rabies virus but also lowers nonspecific viral labeling at the injection site, which was integral for quantifying local raphe connectivity to demonstrate both serotonin-to-serotonin and GABA-to-serotonin neuronal connectivity. Previous studies have indicated that the glutamatergic projection from the prefrontal cortex to the dorsal raphe can modulate both stress and depression-like behaviors (Amat et al., 2005Amat J.

Interestingly, the authors found that ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons and DR serotonergic neurons receive input from strikingly similar presynaptic structures.

Additionally, DR serotonergic neurons synapse directly onto VTA dopaminergic neurons, further suggesting coordinated and tightly regulated circuit-level activity between these two neuromodulatory cell groups. While these three studies elegantly provide long-range and local circuit maps for the precise inputs to serotonin neurons, there are a few considerations related to approach used in all three studies. First, there may be subtle differences in which types of synapses (i.e., excitatory, inhibitory, neuromodulatory) that rabies virus can effectively utilize to propagate, which in turn could lead to biased labeling of input neuron populations. For example, Wall et al., 2013Wall N.R. De La Parra M. Callaway E.M. Kreitzer A.C. Neuron. 2013; 79: 347-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar recently reported that midbrain dopaminergic neurons are likely underlabeled when tracing inputs to direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons using a similar approach. Second, while quantitative whole-brain cell counting data is useful, demonstrating functional connectivity between genetically defined pre- and postsynaptic neurons can greatly aide in determining whether a given input circuit is physiologically relevant. Lastly, the transynaptic labeling strategies used in these three studies rely upon the high degree of colocalization in expression of cre recombinase and markers for cell-type-specific function (i.e., Sert, Gad, and others). While many cre-diver lines are exquisitely specific for distinct cell types, it is likely that none of these mouse lines are entirely specific due to changing dynamics of gene expression over the developmental lifespan, as well as potential changes in the gene expression landscape due to neural activity and plasticity. Taken together, these studies begin to provide a cyclopedic map of the neuronal inputs to the serotonin system, thus offering an important circuit blueprint to put into context previous and future physiological and behavioral studies of the raphe nuclei.

https://openalex.org/W2004515653,"Cellular membranes, which can serve as scaffolds for signal transduction, dynamically change their characteristics upon cell detachment. Src family kinases undergo post-translational lipid modification and are involved in a wide range of signaling events at the plasma membrane, such as cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and survival. Previously, we showed the differential membrane distributions among the members of Src family kinases by sucrose density gradient fractionation. However, little is known about the regulation of the membrane distribution of Src family kinases upon cell detachment. Here, we show that cell detachment shifts the main peak of the membrane distribution of Lyn, a member of Src family kinase, from the low density to the high density membrane fractions and enhances the kinase activity of Lyn. The change in Lyn distribution upon cell detachment involves both dynamin activity and a decrease in membrane cholesterol. Cell detachment activates Lyn through decreased membrane cholesterol levels during a change in its membrane distribution. Furthermore, cholesterol incorporation decreases Lyn activity and reduces the viability of suspension cells. These results suggest that cell detachment-induced Lyn activation through the change in the membrane distribution of Lyn plays an important role in survival of suspension cells."
https://openalex.org/W2007327023,"The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a key conserved regulator of eukaryotic cell growth. The xenobiotic rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of the yeast complex. Surprisingly, the EGO complex, a nonessential in vivo activator of TORC1, is somehow required for yeast cells to recover efficiently from a period of treatment with rapamycin. Why? Here, we found that rapamycin is only a partial inhibitor of TORC1. We confirmed that saturating amounts of rapamycin do not fully inhibit proliferation of wild-type cells, and we found that the residual proliferation in the presence of the drug is dependent on the EGO complex and on the activity of TORC1. We found that this residual TORC1-dependent proliferation is key to recovery from rapamycin treatment. First, the residual proliferation rate correlates with the ability of cells to recover from treatment. Second, the residual proliferation rate persists long after washout of the drug and until cells recover. Third, the total observable pool of cell-associated rapamycin is extremely stable and decreases only with increasing cell number after washout of the drug. Finally, consideration of the residual proliferation rate alone accurately and quantitatively accounts for the kinetics of recovery of wild-type cells and for the nature and severity of the ego- mutant defect. Overall, our results revealed that rapamycin is a partial inhibitor of yeast TORC1, that persistence of the drug limits recovery, and that rapamycin is not detoxified by yeast but is passively diluted among progeny cells because of residual proliferation."

Mortality is thought to be density-dependent in juvenile bivalves, because there is no proportional relationship between the size of the reproductive adult stocks and the numbers of recruits for both species. It is not known however, when exactly density dependence in the pre-recruitment phase occurs and how prevalent it is. The magnitude of recruitment determines year class strength in bivalves. Thus, understanding pre-recruit mortality will improve the understanding of population dynamics. We analyzed count data from three years of temporal sampling during the first months after bivalve settlement at ten transects in the Sylt-Rømø-Bay in the northern German Wadden Sea. Analyses of density dependence are sensitive to bias through measurement error. Measurement error was estimated by bootstrapping, and residual deviances were adjusted by adding process error. With simulations the effect of these two types of error on the estimate of the density-dependent mortality coefficient was investigated. In three out of eight time intervals density dependence was detected for M. balthica, and in zero out of six time intervals for C. edule. Biological or environmental stochastic processes dominated over density dependence at the investigated scale."
https://openalex.org/W2035838616,"Impairment in beta-cell exocytosis is associated with reduced insulin secretion and diabetes. Here we aimed to investigate the dynamics of Ca2+-dependent insulin exocytosis with respect to pool depletion and Ca2+-current inactivation. We studied exocytosis, measured as increase in membrane capacitance (ΔCm), as a function of calcium entry (Q) in insulin secreting INS-1 832/13 cells using patch clamp and mixed-effects statistical analysis. The observed linear relationship between ΔCm and Q suggests that Ca2+-channel inactivation rather than granule pool restrictions is responsible for the decline in exocytosis observed at longer depolarizations. INS-1 832/13 cells possess an immediately releasable pool (IRP) of ∼10 granules and most exocytosis of granules occurs from a large pool. The latter is attenuated by the calcium-buffer EGTA, while IRP is unaffected. These findings suggest that most insulin release occurs away from Ca2+-channels, and that pool depletion plays a minor role in the decline of exocytosis upon prolonged stimulation."

The final motor output induced by nMLF will involve integration in the hindbrain and premotor circuits in the spinal cord. Animals navigate through their environment with extreme agility by grading the speed and strength of their locomotor movements while at the same time controlling their balance (posture). The generation and execution of the locomotion stems from neuronal circuits in the spinal cord (CPG) that transform descending commands from the brain into coordinated motor patterns. While there is substantial knowledge on the organization of the spinal CPG (Arber, 2012Arber S.

In this issue of Neuron, three complementary papers, Severi et al., 2014Severi K.E. Portugues R. Marques J.C. O’Malley D.M. Orger M.B. Engert F.

The 5- to 6-day-old zebrafish larva has a long way to go until it matures to its adult version, but it is nevertheless an astounding neuronal machine that is able to generate a variety of complex patterns of behavior. When it is swimming around, it is at the same time hunting for food, mostly in the form of swimming amoebae. It cannot only identify these moving targets but also steer toward them to ingest them. This preparation allows for a great variety of experimental approaches and has yielded important insights into the operation of the motor system. The Baier (Thiele et al., 2014Thiele T.R.

McLean D.L. Neuron. 2014; 83 (this issue): 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) laboratories report here on visually evoked swimming in the larval zebrafish. In focus is the midbrain nucleus of the medial longitudinal nucleus (nMLF) that is activated by visual stimuli, eliciting forward locomotion (Gahtan et al., 2005Gahtan E. Tanger P. Baier H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9294-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, Orger et al., 2008Orger M.B. Kampff A.R. Severi K.E. Bollmann J.H. Engert F. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This nucleus contains a limited number of neurons that project to the hindbrain and spinal cord; in addition, their dendrites ramify in an area in which afferents from the retina terminate (Thiele et al., 2014Thiele T.R. Donovan J.C. Baier H. Neuron. 2014; 83 (this issue): 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Wang and McLean, 2014Wang W.-C. McLean D.L. Neuron. 2014; 83 (this issue): 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Of particular interest here is that the locomotor activity can be induced by natural visual input in a controlled way. Gratings of points moving in a direction from tail to head induces swimming movements, as if the larvae are trying to catch up with the moving points. In this way, bouts of swimming can be triggered, and by increasing the speed of the gratings, the larvae can be made to swim progressively faster. Severi et al., 2014Severi K.E. Portugues R. Marques J.C. O’Malley D.M. Orger M.B. Engert F. Neuron. 2014; 83 (this issue): 692-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar show that the larvae have two preferred modes of locomotion, slow and fast swimming. Many of the experiments are performed in a preparation with the head fixed in agar, in which visual stimuli can still trigger bouts of fictive locomotor activity, however, only in the slow speed range. Neurons in nMLF are activated when visually evoked swimming is triggered, and lesions of a limited number of nMLF neurons reduces the speed of evoked swimming, indicating that these neurons indeed contribute to driving the locomotor circuitry. Conversely, if nMLF is activated by direct electrical stimulation, locomotor activity can be triggered, indicating that this nucleus indeed can be an important contributor for driving locomotor activity. It is interesting to note there is a discrepancy of the electrical versus optogenetic activation of nMLF on the swimming frequency and duration. Increasing the frequency of electrical stimulus pulses increases both the frequency and duration of swimming (Severi et al., 2014Severi K.E. Portugues R. Marques J.C. O’Malley D.M. Orger M.B. Engert F. Neuron. 2014; 83 (this issue): 692-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). By contrast, no change in the frequency of swimming or duration of the bouts is induced by optogenetic stimulation of nMLF with increasing frequencies (Thiele et al., 2014Thiele T.R. Donovan J.C. Baier H. Neuron. 2014; 83 (this issue): 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). If the larval fish shall be able to catch the moving unicellular organisms, it needs to identify their locations and be able to steer the movements toward the prey. Thiele et al., 2014Thiele T.R. Donovan J.C. Baier H. Neuron. 2014; 83 (this issue): 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar show in an elegant way that an activation of nMLF neurons on one side can lead to an isolated bending movement of the body through an activation of a special muscle group (posterior hypaxial muscles). If this occurs during swimming, it will result in steering movements toward the activated side. They also show that a graded activation of the nMLF neurons results in a progressive change of the amplitude of the bending movements. That this is important for steering is shown by the fact that an ablation of some nMLF neurons results in swimming in circles, with an increased bending on the intact side, whereas a bilateral activation of neurons in nMLF results in forward locomotion. Similarly, unilateral optogenetic activation of nMLF results in steering toward the enhanced side. The degree of asymmetric activation would seem to control the amplitude of the turning movement, indicating that the nMLF produces a graded control of turning movements and hence regulates steering and swimming direction. How the retinal input contributes to this with possible direct input to nMLF (the dendrites of nMLF neurons are in the termination field of retinal afferents) is still unclear. Previous studies show (Gahtan et al., 2005Gahtan E. Tanger P. Baier H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9294-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) that the retinal projections to tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) are also important for the steering control, effects probably mediated via nMLF. Since nMLF has extensive collaterals at the brainstem level, it opens up for the possibility that other descending pathways may also be activated from nMLF. The next step in the analyses is to understand how the different types of nMLF neurons influence the spinal cord networks. Some axons extend throughout the spinal cord and others only for a few segments. They have collaterals along their axonal trajectory both in the hindbrain and spinal cord. Since nMLF can elicit locomotor activity, they will have to project directly or indirectly via other reticulospinal pathways to both locomotor network interneurons and motoneurons in the spinal cord. Wang and McLean, 2014Wang W.-C. McLean D.L. Neuron. 2014; 83 (this issue): 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar focus here on the connectivity to motoneurons. They represent the final stage of the processing of the descending inputs from nMLF that transform a tonic drive into graded movements. The main focus is the mechanisms leading to a sequential recruitment of motoneurons by increasing levels of nMLF inputs. They do so by comparing the strength of synaptic connections between an identified nMLF neurons (MeLc) and two types of motoneurons (early-born primary [pMN] and late-born secondary [sMN]). Both MN types receive mixed electrical and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from MeLc neuron. The chemical EPSPs had similar amplitude in both types of MNs, but its occurrence was less reliable in sMNs (∼10%) than in pMNs (∼40%). Despite this, the high-frequency (>200 Hz) tonic input from Melc neuron was more efficient in driving firing in sMNs than in pMNs. This seems to be due to a difference in intrinsic properties between these two MNs, with sMNs having a longer time constant and input resistance than the pMNs. Such a difference in the time constant allows for a more efficient summation of EPSPs in sMNs and hence an earlier recruitment than pMNs. Overall, this study shows that although pMNs and sMNs received equal excitatory inputs from nMLF, only sMNs are preferentially activated based on their effective temporal summation. Such a direct control of specific MN types can contribute to changes in steering during swimming and thus provide a basis for the observations of Baier and Engert labs. The interesting recruitment mechanisms revealed in the larval zebrafish are, however, not maintained, in the adult zebrafish. In the latter case, with a more elaborate motor unit differentiation, the order of activation of motoneurons and interneurons is unrelated to input resistance and is instead the result of a combination of a graded strength of synaptic drive, subthreshold conductance, and action potential threshold (Ampatzis et al., 2013Ampatzis K. Song J. Ausborn J. El Manira A. J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10875-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Ausborn et al., 2012Ausborn J. Mahmood R. El Manira A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 2011; 14: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A recent study has elegantly demonstrated that optogenetic activation of a molecularly identified class of hindbrain V2a neurons drive swimming in zebrafish (Kimura et al., 2013Kimura Y. Satou C. Fujioka S. Shoji W. Umeda K. Ishizuka T. Yawo H. Higashijima S. Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 843-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, optogenetic activation of spinal V2a interneurons generates coordinated swimming pattern (Ljunggren et al., 2014Ljunggren E.E. Haupt S. Ausborn J. Ampatzis K. El Manira A. J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whether these interneurons are the target of nMLF axons or indirectly activated descending systems remains an open question. Finally, while the direct inputs from nMLF to MNs could contribute to steering and direction control, the pattern of activation of sMNs during swimming must involve activation from premotor spinal circuits. Therefore, the final output and the graded activation of these MNs should include integration at the level of the hindbrain as well as at the spinal premotor interneuron circuit and how they convey the drive to sMNs and pMNs. Despite some remaining unsolved issues, these studies provide a series of elegant and complementary experiments on visually evoked locomotor activity. They add substantially to our understanding of how descending commands are integrated at the level of motoneurons to control visually evoked swimming and steering. Spontaneous locomotor activity that does not depend on visual input appears not to depend on nMLF (Gahtan et al., 2005Gahtan E. Tanger P. Baier H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9294-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) but most likely does on the other reticulospinal systems and the upstream locomotor command systems, as in other vertebrate species (Grillner, 2006Grillner S. Neuron. 2006; 52: 751-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Understanding the origin of the command inputs underlying locomotion and postural adjustment (Deliagina et al., 2008Deliagina T.G. Beloozerova I.N. Zelenin P.V. Orlovsky G.N. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 57: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has a long history beginning with the identification of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) (Shik et al., 1966Shik M.L. Severin F.V. Orlovskiĭ G.N. Biofizika. 1966; 11: 659-666PubMed Google Scholar). Later studies, especially in lamprey, have revealed how MLR commands are integrated in the hindbrain nuclei before they are channeled to the spinal CPG (Dubuc et al., 2008Dubuc R. Brocard F. Antri M. Fénelon K. Gariépy J.F. Smetana R. Ménard A. Le Ray D. Viana Di Prisco G. Pearlstein E. et al.Brain Res. Brain Res.

These three studies in zebrafish have provided a novel analysis of the nature of the physiological initiation of the commands for visually evoked locomotion and steering together with the underlying synaptic mechanisms that produce graded movements with a correct balance.

https://openalex.org/W1997070729,"The accumulation of high-throughput data from different experiments has facilitated the extraction of condition-specific networks over the same set of biological entities. Comparing and contrasting of such multiple biological networks is in the center of differential network biology, aiming at determining general and condition-specific responses captured in the network structure (i.e., included associations between the network components). We provide a novel way for comparison of multiple networks based on determining network clustering (i.e., partition into communities) which is optimal across the set of networks with respect to a given cluster quality measure. To this end, we formulate the optimization-based problem of concurrent conditional clustering of multiple networks, termed COCONETS, based on the modularity. The solution to this problem is a clustering which depends on all considered networks and pinpoints their preserved substructures. We present theoretical results for special classes of networks to demonstrate the implications of conditionality captured by the COCONETS formulation. As the problem can be shown to be intractable, we extend an existing efficient greedy heuristic and applied it to determine concurrent conditional clusters on coexpression networks extracted from publically available time-resolved transcriptomics data of Escherichia coli under five stresses as well as on metabolite correlation networks from metabolomics data set from Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to eight environmental conditions. We demonstrate that the investigation of the differences between the clustering based on all networks with that obtained from a subset of networks can be used to quantify the specificity of biological responses. While a comparison of the Escherichia coli coexpression networks based on seminal properties does not pinpoint biologically relevant differences, the common network substructures extracted by COCONETS are supported by existing experimental evidence. Therefore, the comparison of multiple networks based on concurrent conditional clustering offers a novel venue for detection and investigation of preserved network substructures."
