https://openalex.org/W2467260024,"Of several subtypes of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive tumor that lacks expression of hormone receptors for estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and shows a worst prognosis. The small noncoding RNAs (miRNAs) considered as master regulator of gene expression play a key role in cancer initiation, progression and drug resistance and have emerged as attractive molecular biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment targets in cancer. We have done expression profiling of selected miRNAs in paired serum and tissue samples of TNBC patients and corresponding cell lines and compared with that of other subtypes, in order to identify novel serum miRNA biomarkers for early detection and progression of TNBC. A total of 85 paired tumor tissues and sera with an equal number of adjacent normal tissue margins and normal sera from age matched healthy women including tissue and sera samples from 15 benign fibroadenomas were employed for the study. We report for the first time an extremely high prevalence (73.9%) of TNBC in premenopausal women below 35 years of age and a significant altered expression of a panel of three specific oncogenic miRNAs- miR-21, miR-221, miR-210, and three tumor suppressor miRNAs- miR-195, miR-145 and Let-7a in both tissues and corresponding sera of TNBC patients when compared with triple positive breast cancer (TPBC) patients. While miR-21, miR-221 and miR-210 showed significant over-expression, miR-195 and miR-145 were downregulated and well correlated with various clinicopathological and demographic risk factors, tumor grade, clinical stage and hormone receptor status. Interestingly, despite being a known tumor suppressor, Let-7a showed a significant overexpression in TNBCs. It is suggested that this panel of six miRNA signature may serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for an early detection of TNBC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2507716909,"hsc-70 (HSPA8) is a cytosolic molecular chaperone, which plays a central role in cellular proteostasis, including quality control during protein refolding and regulation of protein degradation. hsc-70 is pivotal to the process of macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and endosomal microautophagy. The latter requires hsc-70 interaction with negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) at the endosomal limiting membrane. Herein, by combining plasmon resonance, NMR spectroscopy, and amino acid mutagenesis, we mapped the C terminus of the hsc-70 LID domain as the structural interface interacting with endosomal PS, and we estimated an hsc-70/PS equilibrium dissociation constant of 4.7 ± 0.1 μm. This interaction is specific and involves a total of 4–5 lysine residues. Plasmon resonance and NMR results were further experimentally validated by hsc-70 endosomal binding experiments and endosomal microautophagy assays. The discovery of this previously unknown contact surface for hsc-70 in this work elucidates the mechanism of hsc-70 PS/membrane interaction for cytosolic cargo internalization into endosomes. hsc-70 (HSPA8) is a cytosolic molecular chaperone, which plays a central role in cellular proteostasis, including quality control during protein refolding and regulation of protein degradation. hsc-70 is pivotal to the process of macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and endosomal microautophagy.

https://openalex.org/W2469833664,"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) infection is generally correlated with individual cattle's age, sex, body condition, and with husbandry practices such as herd composition, cattle movement, herd size, production system and proximity to wildlife-including bTB maintenance hosts. We tested the correlation between those factors and the prevalence of bTB, which is endemic in Ethiopia's highland cattle, in the Afar Region and Awash National Park between November 2013 and April 2015. A total of 2550 cattle from 102 herds were tested for bTB presence using the comparative intradermal tuberculin test (CITT). Data on herd structure, herd movement, management and production system, livestock transfer, and contact with wildlife were collected using semi-structured interviews with cattle herders and herd owners. The individual overall prevalence of cattle bTB was 5.5%, with a herd prevalence of 46%. Generalized Linear Mixed Models with a random herd-effect were used to analyse risk factors of cattle reactors within each herd. The older the age of the cattle and the lower the body condition the higher the chance of a positive bTB test result, but sex, lactation status and reproductive status were not correlated with bTB status. At herd level, General Linear Models showed that pastoral production systems with transhumant herds had a higher bTB prevalence than sedentary herds. A model averaging analysis identified herd size, contact with wildlife, and the interaction of herd size and contact with wildlife as significant risk factors for bTB prevalence in cattle. A subsequent Structural Equation Model showed that the probability of contact with wildlife was influenced by herd size, through herd movement. Larger herds moved more and grazed in larger areas, hence the probability of grazing in an area with wildlife and contact with either infected cattle or infected wildlife hosts increased, enhancing the chances for bTB infection. Therefore, future bTB control strategies in cattle in pastoral areas should consider herd size and movement as important risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2464154378,"Although numerous biological functions of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) have been identified, a direct effect of ATF4 on alcoholic liver steatosis has not been described previously. The aim of our current study is to investigate the role of ATF4 in alcoholic liver steatosis and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Here, we showed that the expression of ATF4 is induced by ethanol in hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo, and liver-specific ATF4 knock-out mice are resistant to ethanol-induced liver steatosis, associated with stimulated hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated AMPK knockdown significantly reversed the suppressive effects of ATF4 deficiency on ethanol-induced liver steatosis in mice. In addition, ethanol-fed ATF4 knock-out mice exhibit AMPK-dependent inhibition of fatty acid synthase and stimulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) in the liver. Moreover, hepatic Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) expression was stimulated by ethanol in an ATF4-dependent manner, and adenovirus-mediated TRB3 knockdown blocked ATF4-dependent ethanol-induced AMPK inhibition and triglyceride accumulation in AML-12 cells. Finally, TRB3 directly interacted with AMPK to suppress its phosphorylation. Taken together, these results identify the ATF4-TRB3-AMPK axis as a novel pathway responsible for ethanol-induced liver steatosis.

AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory β/γ subunits. It acts as a key metabolic “switch” by phosphorylating target enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (9Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in muscle during exercise.Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E299-E304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA, the product of ACC, is both a precursor for fatty acid biosynthesis and a potent inhibitor of β-oxidation at the step regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (10Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D.

We therefore hypothesized that ATF4 may play a role in ethanol-induced liver steatosis. The aim of our current study is to investigate this possibility and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In our current study, we showed that ATF4 liver-specific knock-out (ALKO) mice are resistant to ethanol-induced liver steatosis via activation of AMPK. Furthermore, ATF4 regulates AMPK activity via Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3), a direct target of ATF4 (25Carraro V. Maurin A.C. Lambert-Langlais S. Averous J. Chaveroux C. Parry L. Jousse C. Ord D. Ord T. Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Amino acid availability controls TRB3 transcription in liver through the GCN2/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15716Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which could bind directly to AMPK and suppress its phosphorylation. Taken together, our results identify the ATF4-TRB3-AMPK axis as a novel pathway responsible for ethanol-induced liver steatosis. As predicted, Atf4 mRNA and protein were significantly increased following ethanol treatment compared with control cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Similar results were obtained in the livers of mice fed an ethanol diet for 4 weeks compared with mice maintained on a pair-fed control diet (Fig. 1, C and D). The elevated expression of ATF4 in response to ethanol exposure indicates a possible involvement of ATF4 in ethanol-induced liver steatosis. To test this possibility, we fed ALKO or WT mice with a control or an ethanol diet for 4 weeks and examined whether hepatic ATF4 knock-out could prevent ethanol-induced liver steatosis. ALKO mice were generated as described previously (26Li K. Zhang J. Yu J. Liu B. Guo Y. Deng J. Chen S. Wang C. Guo F. MicroRNA-214 suppresses gluconeogenesis by targeting activating transcriptional factor 4.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 8185-8195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and exhibited decreased Atf4 mRNA levels only in the liver and not in muscle or white adipose tissue, with similar body weight, liver weight and food intake compared with ATF4flox/flox (ATF4f/f) mice under a normal chow diet. As predicted, ethanol elevated hepatic Atf4 mRNA levels in WT mice, but not in ALKO mice, compared with corresponding control diet mice (Fig. 2A). However, there was no significant difference in body weight and food intake among the four groups of mice, except that liver weight showed an increased tendency in ethanol-fed WT mice but not in ALKO mice. Histopathological analysis revealed that ethanol caused microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis in the livers of WT mice compared with control-fed WT mice (Fig. 2B). In contrast, ALKO mice substantially alleviated lipid accumulation in livers when fed an ethanol diet (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, lower levels of hepatic and serum TG were detected in ALKO mice compared with WT mice when challenged with ethanol (Fig. 2, C and D). However, no difference was observed in ethanol-increased hepatic or serum total cholesterol (TC), as well as serum FFAs, between WT and ALKO mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Also, ethanol increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in WT mice, but not in ALKO mice, compared with corresponding control-fed mice (Fig. 2E). It has been reported that AMPK is an important regulator for ethanol-induced liver steatosis (6You M. Matsumoto M. Pacold C.M. Cho W.K. Crabb D.W. The role of AMP-activated protein kinase in the action of ethanol in the liver.Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1798-1808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and AMPK activity is inhibited by ATF4 activation in the hypothalamus of mice (20Zhang Q. Yu J. Liu B. Lv Z. Xia T. Xiao F. Chen S. Guo F. Central activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) regulates hepatic insulin resistance in mice via S6K1 signaling and the vagus nerve.Diabetes. 2013; 62: 2230-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ALKO mice may resist ethanol-induced liver steatosis via the activation of AMPK. To test this possibility, we examined phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK and its direct downstream target ACC (27Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. AMP-activated protein kinase: ancient energy gauge provides clues to modern understanding of metabolism.Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2326) Google Scholar) in WT and ALKO mice fed a control or ethanol diet. As expected, ethanol significantly decreased hepatic p-AMPK and p-ACC in WT mice compared with control-fed WT mice, whereas the suppressive effects of ethanol were largely abolished in ALKO mice (Fig. 3A). To confirm a role of AMPK in ATF4 regulation of ethanol-induced liver steatosis, we injected ethanol-fed ALKO mice with adenovirus expressing a dominant negative AMPK variant (Ad-DN AMPK) or control green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP). Functional validation of Ad-DN AMPK was demonstrated by its increased expression and its ability to reduce ethanol-increased p-ACC in the livers of ALKO mice injected with Ad-DN AMPK (Fig. 3B). No significant difference in body weight and liver weight was observed in ALKO mice following injection of Ad-DN AMPK compared with Ad-GFP injection. In contrast, Ad-DN AMPK significantly reversed the protective effects of ATF4 deficiency on ethanol-induced liver steatosis, as demonstrated by histological changes, as well as the contents of hepatic TG and serum TG, although it had no significant effects on contents of hepatic TC and serum TC and FFAs (Fig. 3, C–E). Interestingly, Ad-DN AMPK decreased hepatic FFAs in ethanol-fed ALKO mice (Fig. 3D). Ad-DN AMPK also reversed the suppressed serum AST and ALT levels in ALKO mice following ethanol exposure (Fig. 3F). A disorder in lipid metabolism is one of the major causes for liver steatosis (28Browning J.D. Horton J.D. Molecular mediators of hepatic steatosis and liver injury.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of ATF4 on genes and proteins related to lipid metabolism in the livers of ALKO and WT mice fed a control or ethanol diet. Genes involved in lipogenesis including Srebp1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), Chrebp (carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein), PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ), Acc (acetyl-CoA carboxylase), Acl (ATP citrate lyase), Fas (fatty acid synthase), and Scd1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase); genes involved in fatty acid oxidation including Pparα (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α) and Cpt1α (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a); genes involved in TG secretion including ApoB (apolipoprotein B) and ApoE (apolipoprotein E); and genes involved in fatty acid uptake including Cd36 (cluster of differentiation 36) and Fabp (fatty acid binding protein). Expression of Srebp1c, Acc, and Fas was significantly induced, but expression of Pparα and Cpt1α was reduced, in the livers of WT mice fed an ethanol diet compared with WT mice maintained on a control diet, whereas these ethanol-induced changes in WT mice livers were abolished in ALKO mice (Fig. 4A). No significant differences in other genes were observed in the livers of WT and ALKO mice fed an ethanol diet (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Ad-DN AMPK significantly reversed the expression of Srebp1c, Acc, Fas, Pparα, and Cpt1α in the livers of ethanol-fed ALKO mice compared with Ad-GFP-injected ALKO mice (Fig. 4B). As with the changes of mRNA levels, the protein levels of hepatic FAS and CPT1 were also reversed by Ad-DN AMPK injection (Fig. 4, C and D). TRB3 is a direct target gene of ATF4 (29Jousse C. Deval C.

Hepatic insulin resistance induced by prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced PTEN and TRB3 acetylation in adult rat offspring.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1797-R1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible involvement of loss of TRB3 in mediating ATF4 deletion on stimulated AMPK activity following ethanol exposure. Consistent with this possibility, ethanol increased hepatic TRB3 expression in WT mice, and this effect was abolished in ALKO mice (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated TRB3 knockdown increased AMPK and ACC phosphorylation in mouse primary hepatocytes (Fig. 5B), and overexpression of TRB3 had the opposite effects in mouse primary hepatocytes (Fig. 5C). AMPK and ACC phosphorylation induced by human tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and calmodulin-activated kinase kinase (CaMKK2), the two well known stimulators for AMPK activity (32Woods A. Dickerson K. Heath R. Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Johnstone S.R. Carlson M. Carling D. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β acts upstream of AMP-activated protein kinase in mammalian cells.Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), were also suppressed by TRB3 overexpression in mouse primary hepatocytes (Fig. 5, D and E). A role of TRB3 in mediating ethanol inhibition of AMPK was then tested in a mouse hepatocyte cell line AML-12 infected with adenovirus expressing small hairpin RNAs against TRB3 (Ad-shTRB3) or scrambled adenovirus (Ad-scrambled) in the presence or absence of ethanol. As predicted, ethanol-induced AMPK and ACC inhibition, as well as TG accumulation, were blocked by TRB3 knockdown (as demonstrated by decreased Trb3 mRNA and protein) in AML-12 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 6, A and B). The possibility that TRB3 is a downstream effector of ATF4 under ethanol exposure was demonstrated by the fact that ethanol-induced TRB3 expression was blocked by adenovirus expressing a dominant negative ATF4 variant (Ad-DN ATF4) in AML-12 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Furthermore, ATF4 knockdown-induced stimulation of AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and inhibition of TG accumulation under ethanol treatment was largely reversed by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of TRB3 in AML-12 cells (Fig. 6, E and F). It is shown that TRB3 inhibits AKT phosphorylation by directly binding to AKT/PKB (33Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. TRB3: a tribbles homolog that inhibits Akt/PKB activation by insulin in liver.Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the mechanisms of TRB3 inactivation of AMPK. Interestingly, using the multiple sequence alignment tool DNAman, we found that amino acid sequence around Thr-172 of AMPKα is highly similar to the sequence around Thr-308 of AKT/PKB, which was exactly the domain that binds to TRB3 (33Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. TRB3: a tribbles homolog that inhibits Akt/PKB activation by insulin in liver.Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A). This resemblance suggested that TRB3 may directly bind to AMPK and inhibit its phosphorylation. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments in HEK-293T cells transfected with Myc-TRB3 and HA-AMPKα revealed that HA-AMPKα could interact with TRB3 (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, GST pull-down assays also showed a direct binding of AMPKα and TRB3 (Fig. 7C). To identify the region mediating the interaction between AMPKα and TRB3, we constructed different HA-tagged AMPKα fragments, including residues 287–552 (AMPKα/ΔN), 1–278 (AMPKα/ΔC), and full-length (AMPKα/WT) (Fig. 7D), and co-transfected these plasmids with Myc-TRB3 in HEK-293T cells. A co-IP assay revealed that the region mediating the interaction between AMPKα and TRB3 was located in residues 1–278 of the kinase domain of AMPKα (Fig. 7E). Further deletion mutant analysis showed that an activation loop (residues 157–183) was necessary for AMPK interaction with TRB3 (Fig. 7E). TRB3 has the N-terminal kinase domain (residues 1–113), the kinase-like domain (residues 114–315), and the C-terminal domain (residues 316–355). Truncated mutant analysis showed that neither the N- nor the C-terminal domain of TRB3 was necessary for its interaction with AMPKα (Fig. 7E). In contrast, deletion mutant analysis revealed that the central region (residues 238–266) within the kinase-like domain of TRB3 was required for its interaction with AMPKα (Fig. 7E). Interestingly, we also observed direct binding between TRB3 and AMPK in the livers of WT mice, and this binding was augmented by ethanol exposure and abolished in ALKO mice (Fig. 7F). Furthermore, we found that the effect of TRB3 on AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and TG accumulation depends on the central region within the kinase-like domain of TRB3 (Fig. 7, G and H). Consistent with previous reports showing that TRB3 can bind to and inhibit AKT phosphorylation (33Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. TRB3: a tribbles homolog that inhibits Akt/PKB activation by insulin in liver.Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), we also found that the AKT activity is inhibited by ethanol feeding-induced TRB3 activation in the livers of WT mice (Fig. 7I), and the binding between AKT and TRB3 is increased in livers of mice following ethanol treatment (Fig. 7J). Although it has been shown that ATF4 expression is induced by ethanol (22Magne L. Blanc E. Legrand B. Lucas D. Barouki R. Rouach H. Garlatti M.

Individuals with LI originally recruited at age 7 years and a comparison group of age-matched peers (AMPs) were followed from adolescence (16 years) to adulthood (24 years). We determine patterns of change in depression and anxiety using the Child Manifest Anxiety Scale-Revised (CMAS-R) and Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ). In addition to examining associations with gender, verbal and nonverbal skills, we use a time-varying variable to investigate relationships between depression and anxiety symptoms and transitions in educational/employment circumstances. The results show that anxiety was higher in participants with LI than age matched peers and remained so from adolescence to adulthood. Individuals with LI had higher levels of depression symptoms than did AMPs at 16 years. Levels in those with LI decreased post-compulsory schooling but rose again by 24 years of age. Those who left compulsory school provision (regardless of school type) for more choice-driven college but who were not in full-time employment or study by 24 years of age were more likely to show this depression pathway. Verbal and nonverbal skills were not predictive of this pattern of depression over time. The typical female vulnerability for depression and anxiety was observed for AMPs but not for individuals with LI. These findings have implications for service provision, career/employment advice and support for individuals with a history of LI during different transitions from adolescence to adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2460915060,"Muscle wasting associated with chronic diseases has been linked to decreased expression of PGC-1α and overexpression of PGC-1α counters muscle loss. CREB, in conjunction with the CREB-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC2), is a positive modulator of PGC-1α transcription. We previously reported that PGC-1α expression is decreased in skeletal muscle of diabetic rats despite a high level of CREB phosphorylation (i.e., activation), suggesting that CRTC2-CREB signaling may be dysregulated. In this study, the relationship between CREB/CRTC signaling and PGC-1α expression was examined in L6 myotubes treated with dexamethasone (Dex, 48h) to induce atrophy. Dex decreased PGC-1α mRNA and protein as well as the levels of CRTC1 and CRTC2 in the nucleus. Dex also altered the nuclear levels of two known regulators of CRTC2 localization; the amount of calcinuerin catalytic A subunit (CnA) was decreased whereas SIK was increased. To assess PGC-1α transcription, muscle cells were transfected with a PGC-1α luciferase reporter plasmid (PGC-1α-Luc). Dex suppressed PGC-1α luciferase activity while both isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and over-expression of CRTC1 or CRTC2 increased PGC-1α-Luc activity. Mutation of the CRE binding site from PGC-1α-Luc reporter attenuated the responses to both IBMX and the CRTC proteins. Consistent with the reporter gene results, overexpression of CRTC2 produced an increase in CRTC2 in the nucleus and in PGC-1α mRNA and PGC-1α protein. Overexpression of CRTC2 was not sufficient to prevent the decrease in PGC-1α mRNA or protein by Dex. In summary, these data suggest that attenuated CREB/CRTC signaling contributes to the decrease in PGC-1α expression during atrophy."

Most of this work focuses on the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) family of PcG complexes, which methylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) but whose activity is not sufficient to silence chromatin. The PRC2 family of complexes interacts with thousands of coding and non-coding transcripts in vivo, with varying degrees of specificity in vitro (3Rinn J.L. Kertesz M. Wang J.K. Squazzo S.L. Xu X.

In contrast, the potential for lncRNAs to influence PRC1 function or targeting has been less studied despite the clear mechanistic importance of PRC1 to stable gene silencing.

Defining additional lncRNAs that affect recruitment or silencing by PRC1 may provide novel insights into the regulation of PcG repression during development. Identifying lncRNAs that impact PRC1 biology is challenging because it is not known which specific component(s) of PRC1 (or ancillary factors) might interact with RNA, limiting the utility of in vitro approaches or UV-cross-linked cross linked IP approaches. To address this challenge, we developed a method to systematically identify lncRNAs, which are both in close physical proximity to PRC1 family complexes on chromatin and which affect PRC1 function regardless of the exact components that interact with RNA. We isolated candidate lncRNAs via an immunoprecipitation from cross-linked, purified chromatin with antisera specific for the BMI1 subunit of PRC1. We identified a number of co-precipitating lncRNAs, referred to as CATs (chromatin-associated transcripts), and tested the ability of these lncRNAs to influence regulation of PRC1 function. We focused on a lncRNA from this screen called CAT7, which contains a tandem repeat domain (TRD) found in both humans and zebrafish. Using RNA depletion experiments, we showed that human CAT7 expression is necessary for full repression of the nearby PcG-target gene, MNX1, during neuronal differentiation, and that cat7l, the independently evolved zebrafish analog of CAT7, interacts genetically with zebrafish bmi1a/b to affect brain development. Deficiency of cat7l during zebrafish embryogenesis can be functionally rescued by human CAT7 RNA or suppressed by depletion of a bmi1a/b target gene, indicating convergence of both the lncRNA sequence and function between species. These results implicate CAT7/cat7l in modulating PRC1-mediated gene repression in humans and zebrafish and thus provide a model where rapidly evolving lncRNAs may specifically regulate PRC1 in various developmental and evolutionary settings. To enrich for RNAs that might affect PRC1 function, we identified RNAs that are bound to chromatin in the vicinity of PRC1 using a gradient RNA immunoprecipitation (GRIP) protocol biochemically tailored for chromatin/RNA interactions. It is not known whether any of the numerous components of canonical or variant PRC1 complexes have the ability to bind specifically to RNA, nor is it known whether auxiliary binding proteins confer allosteric changes or provide direct binding surfaces necessary for RNA binding specificity, as has been suggested for PRC2 (17Kaneko S. Bonasio R. Saldaña-Meyer R. Yoshida T. Son J. Nishino K. Umezawa A. Reinberg D. Interactions between JARID2 and noncoding RNAs regulate PRC2 recruitment to chromatin.Mol.

Therefore, we formaldehyde-cross-linked cells to preserve RNA-protein complexes as they are composed on chromatin. Our initial experiments were performed in HeLa F-17 cells, which ectopically express murine FLAG-Bmi1 (18Levine S. S Weiss A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Shao Z. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. The core of the polycomb repressive complex is compositionally and functionally conserved in flies and humans.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6070-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We focused on BMI1 as a proxy for PRC1 family complexes because BMI1 is found both in variant PRC1 family complexes that ubiquitylate H2A and in canonical PRC1 complexes that compact chromatin (7Gao Z. Zhang J. Bonasio R. Strino F. Sawai A. Parisi F. Kluger Y. Reinberg D. PCGF homologs, CBX proteins, and RYBP define functionally distinct PRC1 family complexes.Mol.

Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We isolated chromatin from HeLa nuclei via a CsCl density gradient to reduce cytosolic and nucleoplasmic RNA contaminants. We confirmed that BMI1 co-migrated on the gradient with other PcG subunits, histones, chromatin-bound RNAs, and bulk DNA but not with free RNAs and unbound protein (Fig. 1, B–H). We then immunoprecipitated BMI1 alongside cross-linked protein/RNA from the resulting BMI1-rich fractions. For comparative purposes, we performed two separate IPs from the chromatin fractions, one using antisera against endogenous BMI1 and one targeting FLAG-Bmi1. The co-precipitating RNA from the two IPs (Fig. 1, I–P) was sequenced, and the results were cross-validated; RNAs truly present at PRC1-bound chromatin were expected to be enriched above input signal in both IPs. We identified RNAs enriched in the two IPs by de novo peak calling and analysis of annotated regions. Input-normalized IP enrichment (reads in IP/reads in input) was high and correlated well between BMI1 and FLAG-Bmi1 IPs at overlapping de novo peaks (R = 0.65; 545/12,606-fold change >4 and q-value <0.05) and at previously annotated lncRNAs (R = 0.92; 102/422-fold change >4 and q-value <0.05). In contrast, mRNA exons were not strongly enriched (R = 0.32; 8/5637-fold change >4 and q-value <0.05, Fig. 1, M–P, supplemental Table 1), suggesting that nascent mRNAs are not prominently found at sites of PRC1 binding. To test the reproducibility and specificity of this screen, we replicated the BMI1 IP alongside control IPs targeting the widely bound chromatin protein CTCF (not known to interact with PRC1) or an IgG control (Fig. 1, Q and R). We performed RT-qPCR on 64 candidates and controls, which we call CATs, and validated 43 candidates that co-precipitated with BMI1/PRC1 but not with controls (Fig. 1R, supplemental Table 2). These candidates included the REP-E region of the known PcG-interacting lncRNA XIST (Fig. 1, I, M, and R). The strong enrichment for lncRNAs among these candidates, as opposed to mRNA exons, contrasts with previous genome-wide observations for PRC2 (4Zhao J. Sun B.K. Erwin J.A. Song J.-J. Lee J.T. Polycomb proteins targeted by a short repeat RNA to the mouse X chromosome.Science. 2008; 322: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 19Kaneko S. Son J. Bonasio R. Shen S.S. Reinberg D. Nascent RNA interaction keeps PRC2 activity poised and in check.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1983-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and indicates that lncRNAs might be selectively associated with sites of PRC1-bound chromatin. To assess whether the co-precipitating lncRNAs impact expression of PcG-regulated genes, we individually knocked down 17 of the 43 candidates and sequenced total RNA after 48 h (Tables 3 and 4). We identified differentially expressed genes in cells treated with pooled siRNAs targeting the lncRNA versus cells treated with a scrambled control. Knockdown of at least 5 novel candidates distinctly and reproducibly altered PcG-target gene expression (p-value < 0.001, hypergeometric probability). For these 5 candidates, PcG-target genes were among the top 10 overrepresented categories of genes from 6176 previously curated gene sets from HeLa and other cell types (20Liberzon A. Subramanian A.

Molecular signatures database (MSigDB) 3.0.Bioinformatics. 2011; 27: 1739-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar) (FDR < 0.001 hypergeometric probability, Fig. 2, C and D), a feature not observed after knockdown of several mRNA/lncRNA controls or between scrambled knockdown controls (supplemental Table 4). We conclude that multiple candidates from our screen cause distinct, widespread molecular phenotypes upon knockdown, characteristic of perturbations to PcG-regulated gene networks (21Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. Bell G.W. Otte A.P. Vidal M. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R.

We note that this screen cannot discriminate between direct and indirect changes to PcG target gene expression, and we anticipate that some observed changes in expression are indirect/cascading effects typical of lncRNAs that perturb PcG-silenced master regulators (6Klattenhoff C.A. Scheuermann J.C. Surface L.E. Bradley R.K. Fields P.A. Steinhauser M.L. Ding H. Butty V.L. Torrey L. Haas S. Abo R. Tabebordbar M. Lee R.T. Burge C.B. Boyer L.A.

Res. 2012; 4: 127-150PubMed Google Scholar). We anticipated that lncRNAs that impact PcG biology would be primarily localized to the nucleus and likely expressed in a tissue-specific manner in cells from across the body. We characterized the 64 candidates selected as above with respect to cellular localization and expression in various tissues and also examined transcript abundance and possible sequence motifs. To query nuclear localization, we examined cell-fractionated RNA-seq data from ENCODE and found that 53/59 of the candidates (for which there was sufficient signal) were primarily or exclusively observed in the nuclear fraction (supplemental Table 2, Fig. 2B). This set included all 43 candidates that were validated in the biological replicate of the BMI1 gradient RNA IP. Nuclear localization might be expected from RNAs identified via a chromatin fractionation and co-precipitated by a nuclear factor. However, in contrast, PRC2 binds many (possibly nascent) mRNA exons (4Zhao J. Sun B.K. Erwin J.A. Song J.-J. Lee J.T. Polycomb proteins targeted by a short repeat RNA to the mouse X chromosome.Science. 2008; 322: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 19Kaneko S. Son J. Bonasio R. Shen S.S. Reinberg D. Nascent RNA interaction keeps PRC2 activity poised and in check.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1983-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which are primarily transported to the cytoplasm to enact their known functions. The nuclear localization supports the hypothesis that the primary functional roles of the candidates identified in this screen likely occur within the nucleus. We also analyzed the sequences of the candidates but were not able to find compelling specific sequence motifs. Many candidates (22 of 43; supplemental Table 2), such as CAT7 and XIST REP-E (Fig. 1, F and G, supplemental fig. 2C), contained unique tandem repeats, which are much less likely to be contained in mRNA exons. Although the different characteristics of the RNAs that interact with PRC1 and PRC2 may partially be attributed to the technical implementation of GRIP versus prior IP techniques, it is possible that PRC1 and PRC2, known to have distinct activities, also have distinct functional interactions with RNAs. We further tested RNA expression of several candidates across a variety of adult and embryonic tissues by RT-qPCR and found that the lncRNA candidates were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner (data not shown). We found that expression levels of the 64 candidates varied widely in the input fraction (supplemental Table 1). This demonstrates that the candidates we identified are expressed at a large range of abundances (>100-fold range of expression in input, measured in RPKM). To further explore possible regulatory relationships between the candidate lncRNAs and PRC1, we focused on the 1.6-kb, polyadenylated, single-exon lncRNA, CAT7 (RACE-PCR results in Fig. 1J). We selected CAT7 from the five candidates above because its knockdown reproducibly impacted many PcG-regulated genes (supplemental Table 4) and because it contains a TRD that is unique to a single locus in the genome yet is present in several organisms (see below). We hypothesized that CAT7 may positively influence PcG binding at gene(s) whose expression increased after CAT7 knockdown. We examined the relationship between CAT7 and the up-regulated PcG-target, MNX1, which stood out because of its proximity to the CAT7 gene (∼400 kb) and the precedent for lncRNAs to regulate gene expression over a long range in cis (24Nagano T. Fraser P. Emerging similarities in epigenetic gene silencing by long noncoding RNAs.Mamm. Genome. 2009; 20: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MNX1 is essential for formation of both pancreatic beta islets and motor neurons, and its dysfunction is implicated in neonatal diabetes (25Bonnefond A. Vaillant E. Philippe J. Skrobek B. Transcription factor gene MNX1 is a novel cause of permanent neonatal diabetes in a consanguineous family.Diabetes Metab. 2013; 39: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the dominant developmental disorder, Currarino syndrome (26Köchling J. Karbasiyan M. Reis A. Spectrum of mutations and genotype-phenotype analysis in Currarino syndrome.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 9: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, CAT7 is located inside a gene desert region between SHH and RNF32. This region, extending beyond RNF32 toward MNX1 (a target of SHH) is highly cross-regulatory (27Anderson E. Devenney P.S. Hill R.E. Lettice L.A. Mapping the Shh long-range regulatory domain.Development. 2014; 141: 3934-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that there could exist a regulatory relationship between CAT7 and the MNX1 locus. During early motor neuron differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), MNX1 is initially silenced (28van Arensbergen J. García-Hurtado J. Moran I. Maestro M.A. Xu X. Van de Casteele M. Skoudy A.L. Palassini M. Heimberg H. Ferrer J. Derepression of polycomb targets during pancreatic organogenesis allows insulin-producing beta-cells to adopt a neural gene activity program.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CAT7 expression commences at day 2 (estimated ∼5 copies/cell), whereas the rapid up-regulation of MNX1 did not commence until day 6 (Fig. 3A). We hypothesized that CAT7 impacts the temporal regulation of the MNX1 locus. Specifically, as with many genes silenced in hESCs, PcG proteins are associated with MNX1, but further mechanisms are required to modulate PcG silencing as cells traverse through differentiation (28van Arensbergen J. García-Hurtado J. Moran I. Maestro M.A. Xu X. Van de Casteele M. Skoudy A.L. Palassini M. Heimberg H. Ferrer J. Derepression of polycomb targets during pancreatic organogenesis allows insulin-producing beta-cells to adopt a neural gene activity program.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, CAT7 might help to maintain PcG repression before cells become fully committed to the motor neuron lineage. To test this, we knocked down CAT7 in hESCs (day 0) and exposed the cells to posteriorizing neural differentiation conditions (29Chambers S.M. Mica Y. Lee G. Studer L. Tomishima M.J. Dual-SMAD Inhibition/WNT activation-based methods to induce neural crest and derivatives from human pluripotent stem cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1307: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we harvested the cells after 72 h of differentiation (before de-repression of MNX1 under normal conditions). After CAT7 knockdown, expression profiling by RNA sequencing showed an increase in expression of MNX1 in the posteriorized neural culture relative to the scrambled control (supplemental Table 4). We confirmed this result by quantifying MNX1 up-regulation by RT-qPCR alongside two other SHH/PcG-regulated genes, ISL1 and IRX3, which were up- or down-regulated after CAT7 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B), and which show analogous expression patterns in primary mature motor neurons (28van Arensbergen J. García-Hurtado J. Moran I. Maestro M.A. Xu X. Van de Casteele M. Skoudy A.L. Palassini M. Heimberg H. Ferrer J. Derepression of polycomb targets during pancreatic organogenesis allows insulin-producing beta-cells to adopt a neural gene activity program.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, we saw similar expression changes across the genes in hESC-derived motor neuron progenitors generated from an alternative differentiation protocol, in neuronal cells treated with a variety of antisense oligos, and in HeLa cells after CAT7 knockdown (Fig. 3, B–D). CAT7 knockdown did not significantly alter expression of SHH, a known regulator of MNX1 (28van Arensbergen J. García-Hurtado J. Moran I. Maestro M.A. Xu X. Van de Casteele M. Skoudy A.L. Palassini M. Heimberg H. Ferrer J. Derepression of polycomb targets during pancreatic organogenesis allows insulin-producing beta-cells to adopt a neural gene activity program.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect on MNX1 is not a consequence of SHH up-regulation (supplemental Table 4) and that CAT7 might regulate the MNX1 locus. If the observed up-regulation of MNX1 was caused by impaired PRC1-mediated repression after CAT7 knockdown, we might expect to see lowered PcG binding at the MNX1 promoter. To test this model, we performed ChIP-qPCR at the MNX1 locus with antisera targeting a PRC1 component, a PRC2 component, and H3K27me3 (HeLa only) in CAT7-knockdown or scrambled-control cells. We performed these experiments in both HeLa and hESC-derived posteriorized neural culture. In each case we observed a ∼30% loss in PRC1/PRC2/H3K27me3 signal at the MNX1 promoter after CAT7 knockdown (Fig. 3, E and F), a level of effect similar to those caused by knockdown of numerous known PcG-interacting lncRNAs (17Kaneko S. Bonasio R. Saldaña-Meyer R. Yoshida T. Son J. Nishino K. Umezawa A. Reinberg D. Interactions between JARID2 and noncoding RNAs regulate PRC2 recruitment to chromatin.Mol.

Heard E. Allis C.D. Mouse polycomb proteins bind differentially to methylated histone H3 and RNA and are enriched in facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell.

Transcriptional repression by PRC1 in the absence of H2A monoubiquitylation.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), so it is not surprising that both PRC1 and PRC2 subunit binding are impacted by CAT7 knockdown. Conversely, we saw no significant changes in ChIP signal at a HOX positive control locus and minimal signal in all IPs at an intergenic, negative-control locus. We conclude that knockdown of CAT7 de-repressed MNX1 and decreased PcG binding at the MNX1 promoter during human neuronal differentiation as well as in HeLa cells. This supports the hypothesis that a class of lncRNAs can tune PcG binding and function at individual loci. CAT7 has broad sequence similarity to genomic regions across many species (supplemental Table 3), raising the possibility that CAT7-like RNAs are part of a generalized mechanism for regulating PRC1 function. We focused on a unique ∼1.2-kb TRD of CAT7 (Fig. 1G) that has 57% sequence identity with a single genomic region in zebrafish. This region is expressed in zebrafish embryos as evaluated by RT-PCR at 24 h post fertilization (hpf). Because the regions of similarity are not syntenic between primates and other orders (supplemental Table 3) and might, therefore, have arisen independently, we would not expect the RNAs to affect expression of the same target genes (such as MNX1) in human and zebrafish. However, the zebrafish CAT7-like RNA (cat7l) might functionally interact with PRC1 based on its high sequence identity with human CAT7. We, therefore, disrupted zcat7l RNA in zebrafish embryos to study its role in a developing organism and its genetic interactions with bmi1a/b. We tested the functional role of cat7l during zebrafish embryogenesis by morpholino interference of cat7l. Morpholino-mediated disruption was chosen over CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic mutations because small deletions are unlikely to affect lncRNA function; an individual key nucleotide(s) must be identified for deletion to impair function and may not exist in a repetitive domain. Moreover, phenotypes caused by deletion of DNA regulatory elements would be difficult to distinguish from those caused by impaired lncRNA function, confounding interpretation of large deletions. We, therefore, designed morpholinos that bind to cat7l with total complementarity at up to 11 locations across the zebrafish RNA, potentially blocking sites of protein interaction or interrupting RNA secondary structure (see F"
https://openalex.org/W2462946086,"Abstract PgpB belongs to the lipid phosphate phosphatase protein family and is one of three bacterial integral membrane phosphatases catalyzing dephosphorylation of phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) to generate phosphatidylglycerol. Although the structure of its apo form became recently available, the mechanisms of PgpB substrate binding and catalysis are still unclear. We found that PgpB was inhibited by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a competitive mode in vitro. Here we report the crystal structure of the lipid-bound form of PgpB. The structure shows that a PE molecule is stabilized in a membrane-embedded tunnel formed by TM3 and the “PSGH” fingerprint peptide near the catalytic site, providing structural insight into PgpB substrate binding mechanism. Noteworthy, in silico docking of varied lipid phosphates exhibited similar substrate binding modes to that of PE, and the residues in the lipid tunnel appear to be important for PgpB catalysis. The catalytic triad in the active site is essential for dephosphorylating substrates lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, or sphingosine-1-phosphate but surprisingly not for the native substrate PGP. Remarkably, residue His-207 alone is sufficient to hydrolyze PGP, indicating a specific catalytic mechanism for PgpB in PG biosynthesis. We also identified two novel sensor residues, Lys-93 and Lys-97, on TM3. Our data show that Lys-97 is essential for the recognition of lyso-form substrates. Modification at the Lys-93 position may alter substrate specificity of lipid phosphate phosphatase proteins in prokaryotes versus eukaryotes. These studies reveal new mechanisms of lipid substrate selection and catalysis by PgpB and suggest that the enzyme rests in a PE-stabilized state in the bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W2467487062,"Soybean seed coat exists in a range of colors from yellow, green, brown, black, to bicolor. Classical genetic analysis suggested that soybean seed color was a moderately complex trait controlled by multi-loci. However, only a couple of loci could be detected using a single biparental segregating population. In this study, a combination of association mapping and bulk segregation analysis was employed to identify genes/loci governing this trait in soybean. A total of 14 loci, including nine novel and five previously reported ones, were identified using 176,065 coding SNPs selected from entire SNP dataset among 56 soybean accessions. Four of these loci were confirmed and further mapped using a biparental population developed from the cross between ZP95-5383 (yellow seed color) and NY279 (brown seed color), in which different seed coat colors were further dissected into simple trait pairs (green/yellow, green/black, green/brown, yellow/black, yellow/brown, and black/brown) by continuously developing residual heterozygous lines. By genotyping entire F2 population using flanking markers located in fine-mapping regions, the genetic basis of seed coat color was fully dissected and these four loci could explain all variations of seed colors in this population. These findings will be useful for map-based cloning of genes as well as marker-assisted breeding in soybean. This work also provides an alternative strategy for systematically isolating genes controlling relative complex trait by association analysis followed by biparental mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2463632540,"In eukaryotic cells, proteins are targeted to the proteasome for degradation by polyubiquitination. These proteins bind to ubiquitin receptors, are engaged and unfolded by proteasomal ATPases, and are processively degraded. The factors determining to what extent the proteasome can successfully unfold and degrade a substrate are still poorly understood. We find that the architecture of polyubiquitin chains attached to a substrate affects the ability of the proteasome to unfold and degrade the substrate, with K48- or mixed-linkage chains leading to greater processivity than K63-linked chains. Ubiquitin-independent targeting of substrates to the proteasome gave substantially lower processivity of degradation than ubiquitin-dependent targeting. Thus, even though ubiquitin chains are removed early in degradation, during substrate engagement, remarkably they dramatically affect the later unfolding of a protein domain. Our work supports a model in which a polyubiquitin chain associated with a substrate switches the proteasome into an activated state that persists throughout the degradation process.

https://openalex.org/W2461525675,"After a remarkable 86% increase in cereal production from 1980 to 2005, recent crop yield growth in China has been slow. County level crop production data between 1980 and 2010 from eastern and middle China were used to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of rice, wheat and maize yield in five major farming systems that include around 90% of China's cereal production. Site-specific yield trends were assessed in areas where those crops have experienced increasing yield or where yields have stagnated or declined. We find that rice yields have continued to increase on over 12.3 million hectares (m. ha) or 41.8% of the rice area in China between 1980 and 2010. However, yields stagnated on 50% of the rice area (around 14.7 m. ha) over this time period. Wheat yields increased on 13.8 m. ha (58.2% of the total harvest area), but stagnated on around 3.8 m. ha (15.8% of the harvest area). Yields increased on a smaller proportion of the maize area (17.7% of harvest area, 5.3 m. ha), while yields have stagnated on over 54% (16.3 m. ha). Many parts of the lowland rice and upland intensive sub-tropical farming systems were more prone to stagnation with rice, the upland intensive sub-tropical system with wheat, and maize in the temperate mixed system. Large areas where wheat yield continues to rise were found in the lowland rice and temperate mixed systems. Land and water constraints, climate variability, and other environmental limitations undermine increased crop yield and agricultural productivity in these systems and threaten future food security. Technology and policy innovations must be implemented to promote crop yields and the sustainable use of agricultural resources to maintain food security in China. In many production regions it is possible to better match the crop with input resources to raise crop yields and benefits. Investments may be especially useful to intensify production in areas where yields continue to improve. For example, increased support to maize production in southern China, where yields are still rising, seems justified."

Data from the Finnish ESTER study (2009–2011) (n = 538) was used to examine the association between educational attainment and different subcomponents of physical activity and sedentary time measured using hip-worn accelerometers (ActiGraph GT1M) for seven consecutive days. Overall physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light-intensity physical activity and sedentary time were calculated separately for weekdays and weekend days. A latent profile analysis was conducted to identify the different profiles of sedentary time and the subcomponents of physical activity. The educational differences in accelerometer-measured physical activity and sedentary time varied according to the subcomponents of physical activity, and between weekdays and weekend days. A high education level was associated with high MVPA during weekdays and weekend days in both sexes, high sedentary time during weekdays in both sexes, and a low amount of light-intensity physical activity during weekdays in males and during weekdays and weekend days in females. The results indicate different challenges related to unhealthy behaviours in young adults with low and high education: low education is associated with a lack of MVPA, whereas high education is associated with a lack of light-intensity physical activity and high sedentary time especially during weekdays."

Interestingly, our studies show different lesion recognition strategies for the two functionally homologous helicases, as apparent from their distinct DNA strand preferences, which can be rationalized from the different structural features and interactions with other nucleotide excision repair protein factors of the two enzymes."

In this study, the F1 population (142 seedlings) derived from Lagerstroemia fauriei (non-dwarf) × L. indica 'Pocomoke' (dwarf) was phenotyped for six traits (plant height (PH), internode length (IL), internode number, primary lateral branch height (PLBH), secondary lateral branch height and primary branch number), and the IL and PLBH traits were positively correlated with the PH trait and considered representative indexes of PH. Fifty non-dwarf and dwarf seedlings were pooled and subjected to a specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) method, which screened 1221 polymorphic markers. A total of 3 markers segregating between bulks were validated in the F1 population, with the M16337 and M38412 markers highly correlated with the IL trait and the M25207 marker highly correlated with the PLBH trait. These markers provide a predictability of approximately 80% using a single marker (M25207) and a predictability of 90% using marker combinations (M16337 + M25207) in the F1 population, which revealed that the IL and the PLBH traits, especially the PLBH, were the decisive elements for PH in terms of molecular regulation. Further validation was performed in the BC1 population and a set of 28 Lagerstroemia stocks using allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) technology, and the results showed the stability and reliability of the SNP markers and the co-determination of PH by multiple genes. Our findings provide an important theoretical and practical basis for the early prediction and indirect selection of PH using the IL and the PLBH, and the detected SNPs may be useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in crape myrtle."
https://openalex.org/W2474261542,"Wave patterns in lambskin hair follicles are an important factor determining the quality of sheep’s wool. Hair follicles in lambskin from Hu sheep, a breed unique to China, have 3 types of waves, designated as large, medium, and small. The quality of wool from small wave follicles is excellent, while the quality of large waves is considered poor. Because no molecular and biological studies on hair follicles of these sheep have been conducted to date, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of different wave patterns is currently unknown. The aim of this article was to screen the candidate microRNAs (miRNA) and genes for the development of hair follicles in Hu sheep. Two-day-old Hu lambs were selected from full-sib individuals that showed large, medium, and small waves. Integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles employed high-throughout sequencing technology. Approximately 13, 24, and 18 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between small and large waves, small and medium waves, and medium and large waves, respectively. A total of 54, 190, and 81 differentially expressed genes were found between small and large waves, small and medium waves, and medium and large waves, respectively, by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Differentially expressed genes were classified using gene ontology and pathway analyses. They were found to be mainly involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, growth, immune response, and ion transport, and were associated with MAPK and the Notch signaling pathway. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses of differentially-expressed miRNA and genes were consistent with sequencing results. Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression indicated that, compared to small waves, large waves included 4 downregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 8 upregulated genes and 3 upregulated miRNAs, which in turn influenced 13 downregulated genes. Compared to small waves, medium waves included 13 downregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 64 upregulated genes and 4 upregulated miRNAs, which in turn had regulatory effects on 22 downregulated genes. Compared to medium waves, large waves consisted of 13 upregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 48 downregulated genes. These differentially expressed miRNAs and genes may play a significant role in forming different patterns, and provide evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of hair follicles of varying patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2471196727,"When individuals are asked to reproduce intervals of stimuli that are intermixedly presented at various times, longer intervals are often underestimated and shorter intervals overestimated. This phenomenon may be attributed to the central tendency of time perception, and suggests that our brain optimally encodes a stimulus interval based on current stimulus input and prior knowledge of the distribution of stimulus intervals. Two distinct systems are thought to be recruited in the perception of sub- and supra-second intervals. Sub-second timing is subject to local sensory processing, whereas supra-second timing depends on more centralized mechanisms. To clarify the factors that influence time perception, the present study investigated how both sensory modality and timescale affect the central tendency. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to reproduce sub- or supra-second intervals, defined by visual or auditory stimuli. In the sub-second range, the magnitude of the central tendency was significantly larger for visual intervals compared to auditory intervals, while visual and auditory intervals exhibited a correlated and comparable central tendency in the supra-second range. In Experiment 2, the ability to discriminate sub-second intervals in the reproduction task was controlled across modalities by using an interval discrimination task. Even when the ability to discriminate intervals was controlled, visual intervals exhibited a larger central tendency than auditory intervals in the sub-second range. In addition, the magnitude of the central tendency for visual and auditory sub-second intervals was significantly correlated. These results suggest that a common modality-independent mechanism is responsible for the supra-second central tendency, and that both the modality-dependent and modality-independent components of the timing system contribute to the central tendency in the sub-second range."
https://openalex.org/W2474618705,"Background Dengue virus infection is the most rapidly spreading vector-borne disease in the world. Essential research on dengue virus transmission and its prevention requires community participation. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that are associated with the willingness of communities in high prevalence areas to participate in dengue research. The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with the willingness of healthy community members in Aceh province, Indonesia, to participate in dengue research that would require phlebotomy. Methodology/Principal Findings A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in nine regencies and municipalities of Aceh from November 2014 to March 2015. Interviews using a set of validated questionnaires were conducted to collect data on demography, history of dengue infection, socioeconomic status, and knowledge, attitude and practice regarding dengue fever. Two-step logistic regression and Spearman’s rank correlation (rs) analysis were used to assess the influence of independent variables on dependent variables. Among 535 participants, less than 20% had a good willingness to participate in the dengue study. The factors associated with good willingness to participate were being female, working as a civil servant, private employee or entrepreneur, having a high socioeconomic status and good knowledge, attitude and practice regarding dengue. Good knowledge and attitude regarding dengue were positive independent predictors of willingness to participate (OR: 2.30 [95% CI: 1.36–3.90] and 3.73 [95% CI: 2.24–6.21], respectively). Conclusion/Significance The willingness to participate in dengue research is very low among community members in Aceh, and the two most important associated factors are knowledge and attitude regarding dengue. To increase participation rate, efforts to improve the knowledge and attitude of community members regarding dengue fever and dengue-related research is required before such studies are launched."

https://openalex.org/W2460775299,"The aim of this study was to simplify, improve and validate quantitative measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔψM) in pancreatic β-cells. This built on our previously introduced calculation of the absolute magnitude of ΔψM in intact cells, using time-lapse imaging of the non-quench mode fluorescence of tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester and a bis-oxonol plasma membrane potential (ΔψP) indicator. ΔψM is a central mediator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. ΔψM is at the crossroads of cellular energy production and demand, therefore precise assay of its magnitude is a valuable tool to study how these processes interplay in insulin secretion. Dispersed islet cell cultures allowed cell type-specific, single-cell observations of cell-to-cell heterogeneity of ΔψM and ΔψP. Glucose addition caused hyperpolarization of ΔψM and depolarization of ΔψP. The hyperpolarization was a monophasic step increase, even in cells where the ΔψP depolarization was biphasic. The biphasic response of ΔψP was associated with a larger hyperpolarization of ΔψM than the monophasic response. Analysis of the relationships between ΔψP and ΔψM revealed that primary dispersed β-cells responded to glucose heterogeneously, driven by variable activation of energy metabolism. Sensitivity analysis of the calibration was consistent with β-cells having substantial cell-to-cell variations in amounts of mitochondria, and this was predicted not to impair the accuracy of determinations of relative changes in ΔψM and ΔψP. Finally, we demonstrate a significant problem with using an alternative ΔψM probe, rhodamine 123.

https://openalex.org/W2474491659,"DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark that plays a critical role in differentiation and is mediated by the actions of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). TGF-β1 is one of the most potent inducers of fibroblast differentiation, and although many of its actions on fibroblasts are well described, the ability of TGF-β1 to modulate DNA methylation in mesenchymal cells is less clear. Here, we examine the ability of TGF-β1 to modulate the expression of various DNMTs in primary lung fibroblasts (CCL210). TGF-β1 increased the protein expression, but not RNA levels, of both DNMT1 and DNMT3a. The increases in DNMT1 and DNMT3a were dependent on TGF-β1 activation of focal adhesion kinase and PI3K/Akt. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 by Akt resulted in increased protein translation of DNMT3a. In contrast, the increase in DNMT1 by TGF-β1 was not dependent on new protein synthesis and instead was due to decreased protein degradation. TGF-β1 treatment led to the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, which resulted in inhibition of DNMT1 ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. The phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β was dependent on mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. These results demonstrate that TGF-β1 increases expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a through different post-transcriptional mechanisms. Because DNA methylation is critical to many processes including development and differentiation, for which TGF-β1 is known to be crucial, the ability of TGF-β1 to increase expression of both DNMT1 and DNMT3a demonstrates a novel means by which TGF-β1 may regulate DNA methylation in these cells.

We examined the role of the actin-binding protein, filamin A (FLNa), in pericellular collagen remodeling. Compared with wild-type (WT), mice with fibroblast-specific deletion of FLNa exhibited higher density but reduced organization of collagen fibers after increased loading of the periodontal ligament for 2 wk. In cultured fibroblasts, FLNa knockdown (KD) did not affect collagen mRNA, but after 24 h of culture, FLNa WT cells exhibited ∼2-fold higher cell-surface collagen KD cells and 13-fold higher levels of activated β1 integrins. In FLNa WT cells, there was 3-fold more colocalization of talin with pericellular cleaved collagen than in FLNa KD cells. MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression were >2-fold higher in FLNa KD cells than in WT cells. Cathepsin B, which is necessary for intracellular collagen digestion, was >3-fold higher in FLNa WT cells than in KD cells. FLNa WT cells exhibited 2-fold more collagen phagocytosis than KD cells, which involved the FLNa actin-binding domain. Evidently, FLNa regulates PCM remodeling through its effects on degradation pathways that affect the abundance and organization of collagen.-Mezawa, M., Pinto, V. I., Kazembe, M. P., Lee, W.

https://openalex.org/W2465446730,"Lysine acetylation is an important epigenetic mark regulating gene transcription and chromatin structure. Acetylated lysine residues are specifically recognized by bromodomains, small protein interaction modules that read these modification in a sequence and acetylation dependent way regulating the recruitment of transcriptional regulators and chromatin remodelling enzymes to acetylated sites in chromatin. Recent studies revealed that bromodomains are highly druggable protein interaction domains resulting in the development of a large number of bromodomain inhibitors. BET bromodomain inhibitors received a lot of attention in the oncology field resulting in the rapid translation of early BET bromodomain inhibitors into clinical studies. Here we investigated the effects of mutations present as polymorphism or found in cancer on BET bromodomain function and stability and the influence of these mutants on inhibitor binding. We found that most BET missense mutations localize to peripheral residues in the two terminal helices. Crystal structures showed that the three dimensional structure is not compromised by these mutations but mutations located in close proximity to the acetyl-lysine binding site modulate acetyl-lysine and inhibitor binding. Most mutations affect significantly protein stability and tertiary structure in solution, suggesting new interactions and an alternative network of protein-protein interconnection as a consequence of single amino acid substitution. To our knowledge this is the first report studying the effect of mutations on bromodomain function and inhibitor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2473563137,"Immersion-vaccines (bacterins) are routinely used for aquacultured rainbow trout to protect against Yersinia ruckeri (Yr). During immersion vaccination, rainbow trout take up and process the antigens, which induce protection. The zebrafish was used as a model organism to study uptake mechanisms and subsequent antigen transport in fish. A genetically modified Yr was developed to constitutively express green fluorescent protein (GFP) and was used for bacterin production. Larval, juvenile and adult transparent zebrafish (tra:nac mutant) received a bath in the bacterin for up to 30 minutes. Samples were taken after 1 min, 15 min, 30 min, 2 h, 12 h and 24 h. At each sampling point fish were used for live imaging of the uptake using a fluorescence stereomicroscope and for immunohistochemistry (IHC). In adult fish, the bacterin could be traced within 30 min in scale pockets, skin, oesophagus, intestine and fins. Within two hours post bath (pb) Yr-antigens were visible in the spleen and at 24 h in liver and kidney. Bacteria were associated with the gills, but uptake at this location was limited. Antigens were rarely detected in the blood and never in the nares. In juvenile fish uptake of the bacterin was seen in the intestine 30 min pb and in the nares 2 hpb but never in scale pockets. Antigens were detected in the spleen 12 hpb. Zebrafish larvae exhibited major Yr uptake only in the mid-intestine enterocytes 24 hpb. The different life stages of zebrafish varied with regard to uptake locations, however the gut was consistently a major uptake site. Zebrafish and rainbow trout tend to have similar uptake mechanisms following immersion or bath vaccination, which points towards zebrafish as a suitable model organism for this aquacultured species."

Both the activity and mode of action of PeCsn toward soluble chitosan polymers were not different with/without the CBM32 domain of P. elgii (PeCBM32). The decreased activity of PeCsn without PeCBM32 on chitosan powder suggested that PeCBM32 increases the relative concentration of enzyme on the substrate and thereby enhanced enzymatic activity. PeCBM32 specifically bound to polymeric and oligomeric chitosan and showed very weak binding to chitin and cellulose. In isothermal titration calorimetry, the binding stoichiometry of 2 and 1 for glucosamine monosaccharide (GlcN) and disaccharide (GlcN)2, respectively, was indicative of two binding sites in PeCBM32. A three-dimensional model-guided site-directed mutagenesis and the use of defined disaccharides varying in the pattern of acetylation suggested that the amino groups of chitosan and the polar residues Glu-16 and Glu-38 of PeCBM32 play a crucial role for the observed binding. The specificity of CBM32 has been further elucidated by a generated fusion protein PeCBM32-eGFP that binds to the chitosan exposing endophytic infection structures of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CBM32s appended to chitosanases are highly conserved across different chitosanase families suggesting their role in chitosan recognition and degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2460113094,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) actively evades host interferon (IFN) responses but the mechanisms of how it does so are not completely understood. In this study, we present evidence for an HCV factor that contributes to the suppression of retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-mediated IFN induction. Expression of frameshift/alternate reading frame protein (F/ARFP) from HCV -2/+1 frame in Huh7 hepatoma cells suppressed type I IFN responses stimulated by HCV RNA pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and poly(IC). The suppression occurred independently of other HCV factors; and activation of interferon stimulated genes, TNFα, IFN-λ1, and IFN-λ2/3 was likewise suppressed by HCV F/ARFP. Point mutations in the full-length HCV sequence (JFH1 genotype 2a strain) were made to introduce premature termination codons in the -2/+1 reading frame coding for F/ARFP while preserving the original reading frame, which enhanced IFNα and IFNβ induction by HCV. The potentiation of IFN response by the F/ARFP mutations was diminished in Huh7.5 cells, which already have a defective RIG-I, and by decreasing RIG-I expression in Huh7 cells. Furthermore, adding F/ARFP back via trans-complementation suppressed IFN induction in the F/ARFP mutant. The F/ARFP mutants, on the other hand, were not resistant to exogenous IFNα. Finally, HCV-infected human liver samples showed significant F/ARFP antibody reactivity, compared to HCV-uninfected control livers. Therefore, HCV F/ARFP likely cooperates with other viral factors to suppress type I and III IFN induction occurring through the RIG-I signaling pathway. This study identifies a novel mechanism of pattern recognition receptor modulation by HCV and suggests a biological function of the HCV alternate reading frame in the modulation of host innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2461464183,"Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates many key biological processes, including organ development and cell fate determination. Although the biological functions of COUP-TFII have been studied extensively, little is known about what regulates its gene expression, especially the role of inducible extracellular factors in triggering it. Here we report that COUP-TFII expression is regulated specifically by fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which mediates activation of the MEK1/2 pathway in mesenchymal lineage C3H10T1/2 cells. Although FGF2 treatment increased cell proliferation, the induction of COUP-TFII expression was dispensable. Instead, FGF2-primed cells in which COUP-TFII expression was induced showed a low potential for osteoblast differentiation, as evidenced by decreases in alkaline phosphatase activity and osteogenic marker gene expression. Reducing COUP-TFII by U0126 or siRNA against COUP-TFII prevented the anti-osteogenic effect of FGF2, indicating that COUP-TFII plays a key role in the FGF2-mediated determination of osteoblast differentiation capability. This report is the first to suggest that FGF2 is an extracellular inducer of COUP-TFII expression and may suppress the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal cells by inducing COUP-TFII expression prior to the onset of osteogenic differentiation."

In eukaryotic cells, the removal of misfolded proteins is primarily accomplished by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin ligases append polyubiquitin chains onto misfolded protein substrates signaling for their degradation. The kinetics of protein ubiquitylation are paramount as a balance must be achieved between the rapid removal of misfolded proteins versus providing sufficient time for protein chaperones to attempt refolding. To uncover the molecular basis for how PQC substrate ubiquitylation rates are controlled, the reaction catalyzed by nuclear ubiquitin ligase San1 was reconstituted in vitro. Our results demonstrate that San1 can function with two ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, Cdc34 and Ubc1.

E1 activates ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid protein forming a thioester bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group on ubiquitin and a cysteine residue located within the E1 active site. Next, ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to E2. The E2∼ubiquitin (∼ is used to denote a thioester bond) is then recruited by an E3, which brings the E2∼ubiquitin and protein substrate into proximity. E3s may also participate in ubiquitylation by stimulating the ubiquitin transfer activity of E2s (6Branigan E. Plechanovová A. Jaffray E.G. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T.

In these examples, an E2 initiates polyubiquitin chain formation by transferring the first ubiquitin to the E3-bound substrate, whereas a different E2 is responsible for chain elongation. Thus, it is possible that San1 may also function synergistically with both Cdc34 and Ubc1 during nuclear PQC substrate ubiquitylation. However, it is also possible that Cdc34 and Ubc1 may function independently with San1. To distinguish between these 2 hypotheses, an in vitro PQC ubiquitylation system was reconstituted containing E1, ubiquitin, San1, a PQC substrate, and either Cdc34 or Ubc1 alone or in combination. Our results show robust E3-dependent ubiquitylation of substrate in the presence of either Ubc1 or Cdc34; however, Ubc1 consistently shows greater activity with San1 than does Cdc34. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we have developed the first homogeneous peptide substrate for PQC, enabling the use of quantitative enzyme kinetics to characterize the San1 ubiquitylation reaction. The results from these experiments suggest that San1 prefers to function with Ubc1, even in the presence of Cdc34. To uncover whether Cdc34 and Ubc1 may function synergistically with San1, an in vitro ubiquitylation reaction was reconstituted that detected San1 autoubiquitylation. Full-length San1 protein was expressed and purified from bacterial cells (Fig. 1). Because a single lysine San1 would allow for the specific monitoring of polyubiquitin chain formation without the potentially confounding effects of multi-monoubiquitylation, all naturally occurring San1 lysine residues were mutated to arginine, and a single lysine was introduced at Asn-13 because previous experiments in yeast demonstrated that N13K San1 was both autoubiquitylated and capable of binding to misfolded proteins (38Fredrickson E.K. Clowes Candadai S.V. Tam C.H. Gardner R.G. Means of self-preservation: how an intrinsically disordered ubiquitin-protein ligase averts self-destruction.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled N13K San1 was rapidly ubiquitylated in the presence of E1, ubiquitin, and WT yeast Cdc34 (Fig. 2A). The formation of extensive polyubiquitin chains on N13K San1 was evident as early as 15 s. The fraction of San1 proteins that had been modified by one or more ubiquitins was linear during the time course, enabling the determination of the rate of ubiquitylation (some 14% of San1 was modified per minute; Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the location of the single lysine at the N terminus of San1 was not important for promoting San1 autoubiquitylation, as a San1 protein containing a single lysine at the C terminus, N444K San1, was autoubiquitylated with similar kinetics as N13K San1 (Fig. 2, C and D). Most E3s contain a conserved RING domain that recruits E2∼ubiquitin (2Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). N13K San1 that contained an additional mutation known to disrupt RING-E2 interactions (10Pruneda J.N. Littlefield P.J.

Cell. 2012; 47: 933-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (N13K/R280A San1) was produced and was incapable of autoubiquitylation (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that San1 activity was dependent on the interaction between Cdc34∼ubiquitin and the San1 RING domain. San1 autoubiquitylation was next assayed in the presence of WT Ubc1. Polyubiquitin chain formation on N13K San1 was substantially more rapid than in the presence of Cdc34, and the polyubiquitin chains were longer as well (Fig. 3A). Although the amount of N13K San1 autoubiquitylated product quickly diverged from linearity during the time-course (Fig. 3B), the data fit well to a single phase exponential function, allowing for the estimation of the initial rate of San1 modification (see “Experimental Procedures”) and comparison to the rate of San1 autoubiquitylation with Cdc34. Impressively, the rate of San1 ubiquitylation was nearly eight times greater in the presence of Ubc1 than with Cdc34. San1 autoubiquitylation was greatly reduced in the presence of N13K/R280A San1, although some product formation was evident toward the end of the time course (Fig. 3C), hinting that Ubc1 may have greater affinity for San1 and/or greater catalytic activity in the presence of San1 as compared with Cdc34. Finally, similar to reactions containing Cdc34, N444K San1 was also rapidly autoubiquitylated in the presence of Ubc1 (Fig. 3, D and E). E2 activity is often stimulated in the presence of E3 through highly specific interactions at the E2∼ubiquitin-E3 interface (6Branigan E. Plechanovová A. Jaffray E.G. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T.

However, E2 activation only occurs for selective E2-E3 pairs, and E2 stimulation by an E3 in vitro is, therefore, evidence of a functional interaction. To explore this possibility for San1 and either Cdc34 or Ubc1, we used a previously described assay (51Kleiger G. Hao B. Mohl D.A. Deshaies R.J. The acidic tail of the Cdc34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme functions in both binding to and catalysis with ubiquitin ligase SCFCdc4.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36012-36023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that measures E2 activity in either the absence or presence of San1. Briefly, E2 is first thioesterified to 32P-labeled ubiquitin with E1, and the reaction is then initiated by adding unlabeled ubiquitin. Chain formation between unlabeled and labeled ubiquitin results in the formation of a diubiquitin product. WT Cdc34 activity was first measured in the absence of San1 (Fig. 4, A and G, and Table 1). The same reaction was then repeated in the presence of KR San1 that contains no lysine residues and, therefore, does not get autoubiquitylated (note that KR San1 can replace endogenous San1 in vivo; Ref. 38Fredrickson E.K. Clowes Candadai S.V. Tam C.H. Gardner R.G. Means of self-preservation: how an intrinsically disordered ubiquitin-protein ligase averts self-destruction.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The addition of KR San1 resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cdc34 activity (Fig. 4, B and G, and Table 1). This modest increase in Cdc34 activity was dependent on Cdc34 binding to the San1 RING domain, as N13K/R280A San1 did not activate Cdc34 (Fig. 4, C and G, and Table 1).TABLE 1Rates of diubiquitin formation for either WT Cdc34 or Ubc1 in the presence or absence of E3sE2E3Rate of Ub Transfer-Fold changepmol min−1WT yCdc345.6 ± 0.1WT yCdc34N13K/R280A San14.8 ± 0.21WT yCdc34KR San111.0 ± 1.12WT yCdc34Cul1-Rbx1136.6 ± 6.524WT hCdc349.7 ± 0.7WT hCdc34Cul1-Rbx1283.6 ± 6.729WT Ubc10.5 ± 0.04WT Ubc1N13K/R280A San11.5 ± 0.053WT Ubc1KR San118.9 ± 1.938WT Ubc1Cul1-Rbx10.7 ± 0.031 Open table in a new tab Although KR San1 increased Cdc34 activity by 2-fold, this result was unimpressive, as Cdc34 activity was greatly stimulated in the presence of the human SCF subunits Cul1-Rbx1 (Fig. 4, D and H, and Table 1). Indeed, the stimulation of WT Cdc34 activity by Cul1-Rbx1 was comparable to the stimulation of human Cdc34 (Ube2R1/2) activity by Cul1-Rbx1 (Fig. 4, E, F, and H, and Table 1). Thus, San1 activation of yeast Cdc34 was modest when compared with Cdc34 activation by Cul1-Rbx1. The activity of Ubc1 was next measured using the diubiquitin synthesis assay in both the presence and absence of KR San1. Interestingly, E3-independent Ubc1 activity was 10 times slower in comparison with yeast Cdc34 (Fig. 5, A and E, and Table 1). However, the presence of KR San1 stimulated Ubc1 activity by ∼38-fold and in a RING-dependent manner (Fig. 5, B, C, and E, and Table 1). Furthermore, the stimulation of Ubc1 by San1 was specific, as the presence of Cul1-Rbx1 had no effect on Ubc1 activity (Fig. 5, D and E, and Table 1). Taken together, these results demonstrate than San1 is capable of activating both yeast Cdc34 and Ubc1, although Ubc1 stimulation by San1 is far more impressive. The results presented thus far suggest that although both WT Cdc34 and Ubc1 can function in vitro with San1, Ubc1 has greater activity and is also stimulated to a far greater extent in the presence of San1. However, the mechanism of San1 autoubiquitylation may differ substantially in comparison with a reaction involving a San1-bound PQC substrate. To address this, a bona fide PQC substrate that would enable quantitative enzyme kinetics was developed. It had previously been shown that introducing a small, hydrophobic patch in the San1 amino acid sequence resulted in increased turnover of San1 protein in yeast (38Fredrickson E.K. Clowes Candadai S.V. Tam C.H. Gardner R.G. Means of self-preservation: how an intrinsically disordered ubiquitin-protein ligase averts self-destruction.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In those experiments, the RING domain in San1 had been mutated to eliminate autoubiquitylation. Finally, the mutant San1 protein was rapidly degraded in cells containing endogenous WT San1 but not in cells where the San1 gene had been deleted. Thus, the hydrophobic San1 protein mimics a PQC substrate that is recognized by endogenous San1. We reasoned that a synthetic peptide containing the hydrophobic patch and a single nearby lysine residue at the C terminus may function as a minimal San1 substrate in vitro. To help increase the peptide's solubility in aqueous buffer, 13 residues immediately N-terminal to the hydrophobic patch in San1 were also included as many of the residues are hydrophilic. San1 peptide ubiquitylation reactions were first assembled in the presence of KR San1 and WT Cdc34. Polyubiquitin chains were rapidly assembled onto the San1 peptide but not in reactions lacking San1 (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the peptide was not ubiquitylated in the presence of N13K/R280A San1, indicating that an intact RING domain was required to recruit Cdc34 (Fig. 6A). Because it is well known that Cdc34 generates Lys-48-specific polyubiquitin chains on SCF-bound substrates (52Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J.

Indeed, San1 peptide ubiquitylation was similar in reac"

https://openalex.org/W2470846848,"Cystinuria is a classical inborn error of metabolism characterized by a selective proximal renal tubular defect affecting cystine, ornithine, lysine, and arginine (COLA) reabsorption, which can lead to uroliths and urinary obstruction. In humans, dogs and mice, cystinuria is caused by variants in one of two genes, SLC3A1 and SLC7A9, which encode the rBAT and bo,+AT subunits of the bo,+ basic amino acid transporter system, respectively. In this study, exons and flanking regions of the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes were sequenced from genomic DNA of cats (Felis catus) with COLAuria and cystine calculi. Relative to the Felis catus-6.2 reference genome sequence, DNA sequences from these affected cats revealed 3 unique homozygous SLC7A9 missense variants: one in exon 5 (p.Asp236Asn) from a non-purpose-bred medium-haired cat, one in exon 7 (p.Val294Glu) in a Maine Coon and a Sphinx cat, and one in exon 10 (p.Thr392Met) from a non-purpose-bred long-haired cat. A genotyping assay subsequently identified another cystinuric domestic medium-haired cat that was homozygous for the variant originally identified in the purebred cats. These missense variants result in deleterious amino acid substitutions of highly conserved residues in the bo,+AT protein. A limited population survey supported that the variants found were likely causative. The remaining 2 sequenced domestic short-haired cats had a heterozygous variant at a splice donor site in intron 10 and a homozygous single nucleotide variant at a branchpoint in intron 11 of SLC7A9, respectively. This study identifies the first SLC7A9 variants causing feline cystinuria and reveals that, as in humans and dogs, this disease is genetically heterogeneous in cats."
https://openalex.org/W2473946527,"Like various stressors, the addictive use of nicotine (NC) is associated with emotional symptoms such as anxiety and depression, although the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated due to the complicated involvement of target neurotransmitter systems. In the elicitation of these emotional symptoms, the fundamental involvement of epigenetic mechanisms such as histone acetylation has recently been suggested. Furthermore, among the interacting neurotransmitter systems implicated in the effects of NC and stressors, the endocannabinoid (ECB) system is considered to contribute indispensably to anxiety and depression. In the present study, the epigenetic involvement of histone acetylation induced by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors was investigated in anxiety- and depression-related behavioral alterations caused by NC and/or immobilization stress (IM). Moreover, based on the contributing roles of the ECB system, the interacting influence of ECB ligands on the effects of HDAC inhibitors was evaluated in order to examine epigenetic therapeutic interventions. Anxiety-like (elevated plus-maze test) and depression-like (forced swimming test) behaviors, which were observed in mice treated with repeated (4 days) NC (subcutaneous 0.8 mg/kg) and/or IM (10 min), were blocked by the HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate (SB) and valproic acid (VA). The cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) agonist ACPA (arachidonylcyclopropylamide; AC) also antagonized these behaviors. Conversely, the CB1 antagonist SR 141716A (SR), which counteracted the effects of AC, attenuated the anxiolytic-like effects of the HDAC inhibitors commonly in the NC and/or IM groups. SR also attenuated the antidepressant-like effects of the HDAC inhibitors, most notably in the IM group. From these results, the combined involvement of histone acetylation and ECB system was shown in anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. In the NC treatment groups, the limited influence of SR against the HDAC inhibitor-induced antidepressant-like effects may reflect the characteristic involvement of histone acetylation within the NC-related neurotransmitter systems other than the ECB system."

It is worth developing diagnostic tools for bladder cancer. In our previous study, we found that the bladder carcinogen BBN increased urothelial global DNA CpG methylation and decreased GSTM1 protein expression in mice. Here, the correlation of BBN-decreased GSTM1 and GSTM gene CpG methylation status was analyzed in mice bladders. BBN treatment decreased the protein and mRNA expression of GSTM1, and the CpG methylation ratio of GSTM1 gene promoter was slightly increased in mice bladders. Unlike mouse GSTM1, the human GSTM1 gene tends to be deleted in bladder cancers. Among 7 human bladder cancer cell lines, GSTM1 gene is really null in 6 cell lines except one, T24 cells. The CpG methylation level of GSTM1 was 9.9% and 5-aza-dC did not significantly increase GSTM1 protein and mRNA expression in T24 cells; however, the GSTM5 gene was CpG hypermethylated (65.4%) and 5-aza-dC also did not affect the methylation ratio and mRNA expression. However, in other cell lines without GSTM1, 5-aza-dC increased GSTM5 expression and decreased its CpG DNA methylation ratio from 84.6% to 61.5% in 5637, and from 97.4% to 75% in J82 cells. In summary, two biomarkers of bladder tumor were provided. One is the GSTM1 gene which is down-regulated in mice bladder carcinogenesis and is usually deleted in human urothelial carcinoma, while the other is the GSTM5 gene, which is inactivated by DNA CpG methylation."

https://openalex.org/W2469753179,"Background Undiagnosed infections accounted for the hidden proportion of HIV cases that have escaped from public health surveillance. To assess the population risk of HIV transmission, we estimated the undiagnosed interval of each known infection for constructing the HIV incidence curves. Methods We used modified back-calculation methods to estimate the seroconversion year for each diagnosed patient attending any one of the 3 HIV specialist clinics in Hong Kong. Three approaches were used, depending on the adequacy of CD4 data: (A) estimating one’s pre-treatment CD4 depletion rate in multilevel model;(B) projecting one’s seroconversion year by referencing seroconverters’ CD4 depletion rate; or (C) projecting from the distribution of estimated undiagnosed intervals in (B). Factors associated with long undiagnosed interval (>2 years) were examined in univariate analyses. Epidemic curves constructed from estimated seroconversion data were evaluated by modes of transmission. Results Between 1991 and 2010, a total of 3695 adult HIV patients were diagnosed. The undiagnosed intervals were derived from method (A) (28%), (B) (61%) and (C) (11%) respectively. The intervals ranged from 0 to 10 years, and were shortened from 2001. Heterosexual infection, female, Chinese and age >64 at diagnosis were associated with long undiagnosed interval. Overall, the peaks of the new incidence curves were reached 4–6 years ahead of reported diagnoses, while their contours varied by mode of transmission. Characteristically, the epidemic growth of heterosexual male and female declined after 1998 with slight rebound in 2004–2006, but that of MSM continued to rise after 1998. Conclusions By determining the time of seroconversion, HIV epidemic curves could be reconstructed from clinical data to better illustrate the trends of new infections. With the increasing coverage of antiretroviral therapy, the undiagnosed interval can add to the measures for assessing HIV transmission risk in the population."
https://openalex.org/W2462622047,"Selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1) is not a selenoprotein but structurally binds selenium. Loss of SBP1 during carcinogenesis usually predicts poor prognosis. Because genome instability is a hallmark of cancer, we hypothesize that SBP1 sequesters cellular selenium and sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down SBP1 expression in HeLa cervical cancer cells by employing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach. Reduced sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, paraquat and camptothecin, reactive oxygen species content, and intracellular retention of selenium after selenomethionine treatment were observed in SBP1 shRNA HeLa cells. Results from Western analyses showed that treatment of HeLa cells with selenomethionine resulted in increased SBP1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of SBP1 rendered HeLa cells increased expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 but not glutathione peroxidase-4 protein levels and accelerated migration from a wound. Altogether, SBP1 retains supplemental selenium and sensitizes HeLa cancer cells to clastogens, suggesting a new cancer treatment strategy by sequestering selenium through SBP1."
https://openalex.org/W2465906678,"Intravenous iron supplementation is an effective therapy in iron deficiency anemia (IDA), but controversial in anemia of inflammation (AI). Unbound iron can be used by bacteria and viruses for their replication and enhance the inflammatory response. Nowadays available high molecular weight iron complexes for intravenous iron substitution, such as ferric carboxymaltose, might be useful in AI, as these pharmaceuticals deliver low doses of free iron over a prolonged period of time. We tested the effects of intravenous iron carboxymaltose in murine AI: Wild-type mice were exposed to the heat-killed Brucella abortus (BA) model and treated with or without high molecular weight intravenous iron. 4h after BA injection followed by 2h after intravenous iron treatment, inflammatory cytokines were upregulated by BA, but not enhanced by iron treatment. In long term experiments, mice were fed a regular or an iron deficient diet and then treated with intravenous iron or saline 14 days after BA injection. Iron treatment in mice with BA-induced AI was effective 24h after iron administration. In contrast, mice with IDA (on iron deficiency diet) prior to BA-IA required 7d to recover from AI. In these experiments, inflammatory markers were not further induced in iron-treated compared to vehicle-treated BA-injected mice. These results demonstrate that intravenous iron supplementation effectively treated the murine BA-induced AI without further enhancement of the inflammatory response. Studies in humans have to reveal treatment options for AI in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2468150433,"Access to sanitation facilities is imperative in reducing the risk of multiple adverse health outcomes. A distinct disparity in sanitation exists among different wealth levels in many low-income countries, which may hinder the progress across each of the Millennium Development Goals.The surveyed households in 397 clusters from 2008-2009 Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys were divided into five wealth quintiles based on their national asset scores. A series of spatial analysis methods including excess risk, local spatial autocorrelation, and spatial interpolation were applied to observe disparities in coverage of improved sanitation among different wealth categories. The total number of the population with improved sanitation was estimated by interpolating, time-adjusting, and multiplying the surveyed coverage rates by high-resolution population grids. A comparison was then made with the annual estimates from United Nations Population Division and World Health Organization /United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation.The Empirical Bayesian Kriging interpolation produced minimal root mean squared error for all clusters and five quintiles while predicting the raw and spatial coverage rates of improved sanitation. The coverage in southern regions was generally higher than in the north and east, and the coverage in the south decreased from Nairobi in all directions, while Nyanza and North Eastern Province had relatively poor coverage. The general clustering trend of high and low sanitation improvement among surveyed clusters was confirmed after spatial smoothing.There exists an apparent disparity in sanitation among different wealth categories across Kenya and spatially smoothed coverage rates resulted in a closer estimation of the available statistics than raw coverage rates. Future intervention activities need to be tailored for both different wealth categories and nationally where there are areas of greater needs when resources are limited."
https://openalex.org/W2464093769,"Strain NI1060 is an oral bacterium responsible for periodontitis in a murine ligature-induced disease model. To better understand its pathogenicity, we have determined the complete sequence of its 2,553,982 bp genome. Although closely related to Pasteurella pneumotropica, a pneumonia-associated rodent commensal based on its 16S rRNA, the NI1060 genomic content suggests that they are different species thriving on different energy sources via alternative metabolic pathways. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that strain NI1060 is distinct from the genera currently described in the family Pasteurellaceae, and is likely to represent a novel species. In addition, we found putative virulence genes involved in lipooligosaccharide synthesis, adhesins and bacteriotoxic proteins. These genes are potentially important for host adaption and for the induction of dysbiosis through bacterial competition and pathogenicity. Importantly, strain NI1060 strongly stimulates Nod1, an innate immune receptor, but is defective in two peptidoglycan recycling genes due to a frameshift mutation. The in-depth analysis of its genome thus provides critical insights for the development of NI1060 as a prime model system for infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2462801379,"Background Although major guidelines uniformly recommend iron supplementation and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) for managing chronic anemia in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD), there are differences in the recommended hemoglobin (Hb) treatment target and no guidelines consider the costs or cost-effectiveness of treatment. In this study, we explored the most cost-effective Hb target for anemia treatment in persons with CKD stages 3–4. Methods and Findings The CKD Health Policy Model was populated with a synthetic cohort of persons over age 30 with prevalent CKD stages 3–4 (i.e., not on dialysis) and anemia created from the 1999–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), computed as incremental cost divided by incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs), were assessed for Hb targets of 10 g/dl to 13 g/dl at 0.5 g/dl increments. Targeting a Hb of 10 g/dl resulted in an ICER of $32,111 compared with no treatment and targeting a Hb of 10.5 g/dl resulted in an ICER of $32,475 compared with a Hb target of 10 g/dl. QALYs increased to 4.63 for a Hb target of 10 g/dl and to 4.75 for a target of 10.5 g/dl or 11 g/dl. Any treatment target above 11 g/dl increased medical costs and decreased QALYs. Conclusions In persons over age 30 with CKD stages 3–4, anemia treatment is most cost-effective when targeting a Hb level of 10.5 g/dl. This study provides important information for framing guidelines related to treatment of anemia in persons with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2463283642,"Rates of Sudden Unexplained Infant Death (SUID), bronchiolitis, and central apnea increase in winter in temperate climates. Though associations between these three conditions are suggested, more work is required to establish if there is a causal pathway linking bronchiolitis to SUID through inducing central apnea. Utilizing a large population-based cohort of infants studied over a 20-year period (n = 834,595, from birth years 1989–2009)), we analyzed ecological associations between timing of SUID cases, bronchiolitis, and apnea healthcare visits. Data were analyzed between 2013 and 2015. We used a Cox Proportional Hazards model to analyze possible interactions between maternal smoking and maternal asthma with infant bronchiolitis on time to SUID. SUID and bronchiolitis both occurred more frequently in winter. An increase in bronchiolitis clinical visits occurred within a few days prior to apnea visits. We found a temporal relationship between infant bronchiolitis and apnea. In contrast, no peak in SUID cases was seen during peaks of bronchiolitis. Among those without any bronchiolitis visits, maternal smoking was associated with an increased risk of SUID: Hazard Ratio (HR) of 2.38 (95% CI: 2.11, 2.67, p-value <0.001). Maternal asthma was associated with an increased risk of SUID among infants with at least one bronchiolitis visit: HR of 2.40 (95% CI: 1.04, 5.54, p-value = 0.04). Consistent trends between bronchiolitis, apnea, and SUID were not established due to small numbers of SUID cases. However, interaction analysis revealed potential differential associations of bronchiolitis and SUID by maternal smoking, maternal asthma status."
https://openalex.org/W2470977094,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the inhibitory modulation of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptides, particularly with respect to the function of the D3 dopamine receptor (D3R), which is activated by its interaction with phosphorylated CaMKIIα (pCaMKIIα) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). After repeated oral administration of caffeine (30 mg/kg) for five days, microinjection of CART peptide (0.08 μM/0.5 μl/hemisphere) into the NAc affected locomotor behavior. The pCaMKIIα-D3R interaction, D3R phosphorylation and cAMP/PKA/phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) signaling pathway activity were measured in NAc tissues, and Ca2+ influx and pCaMKIIα levels were measured in cultured NAc neurons. We found that CART attenuated the caffeine-mediated enhancement of depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx and CaMKIIα phosphorylation in cultured NAc neurons. Repeated microinjection of CART peptides into the NAc decreased the caffeine-induced enhancement of Ca2+ channels activity, pCaMKIIα levels, the pCaMKIIα-D3R interaction, D3R phosphorylation, cAMP levels, PKA activity and pCREB levels in the NAc. Furthermore, behavioral sensitization was observed in rats that received five-day administration of caffeine following microinjection of saline but not in rats that were treated with caffeine following microinjection of CART peptide. These results suggest that caffeine-induced CREB phosphorylation in the NAc was ameliorated by CART peptide due to its inhibition of D3R phosphorylation. These effects of CART peptides may play a compensatory role by inhibiting locomotor behavior in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2465673029,"Clinicians often experience delayed epithelialization in diabetic patients, for which a high glucose condition is one of the causes. However, the mechanisms underlying delayed wound closure have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatments to enhance epithelialization in patients with hyperglycaemia have not been established. Here we propose a new reagent, acylated homoserine lactone (AHL), to improve the delayed epithelialization due to the disordered formation of a basement membrane of epidermis in hyperglycaemic rats. Acute hyperglycaemia was induced by streptozotocin injection in this experiment. Full thickness wounds were created on the flanks of hyperglycaemic or control rats. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to identify hyperglycaemia-specific abnormalities in epidermal regeneration by comparison between groups. We then examined the effects of AHL on delayed epithelialization in hyperglycaemic rats. Histological analysis showed the significantly shorter epithelializing tissue (P < 0.05), abnormal structure of basement membrane (fragmentation and immaturity), and hypo- and hyperproliferation of basal keratinocytes in hyperglycaemic rats. Treating the wound with AHL resulted in the decreased abnormalities of basement membrane, normal distribution of proliferating epidermal keratinocytes, and significantly promoted epithelialization (P < 0.05) in hyperglycemic rats, suggesting the improving effects of AHL on abnormal epithelialization due to hyperglycemia."

https://openalex.org/W2471873247,"The non-classical MHC I paralogue HLA-G is expressed by cytotrophoblast cells and implicated with fetomaternal tolerance by downregulating the maternal adaptive and innate immune response against the fetus. HLA-G expression correlates with favorable graft outcome in humans and recently promising immunosuppressive effects of therapeutic HLA-G in experimental transplantation (skin allograft acceptance) were shown. Consequently, we examined this novel therapeutic approach in solid organ transplantation. In this study, therapeutic recombinant HLA-G5 was evaluated for the first time in a solid organ model of acute rejection (ACR) after orthotopic intestinal transplantation (ITX). Allogenic ITX was performed in rats (Brown Norway to Lewis) with and without HLA-G treatment. It was found that HLA-G treatment significantly reduced histologically proven ACR at both an early and late postoperative timepoint (POD 4/7), concomitant to a functionally preserved graft contractility at POD 7. Interestingly, graft infiltration by myeloperoxidase+ cells was significantly reduced at POD7 by HLA-G treatment. Moreover, HLA-G treatment showed an effect on the allogenic T-cell immune response as assessed by flow cytometry: The influx of recipient-derived CD8+ T-cells into the graft mesenteric lymphnodes at POD7 was significantly reduced while CD4+ populations were not affected. As a potential mechanism of action, an induction of T-reg populations in the mesenteric lymphnodes was postulated, but flow cytometric analysis of classical CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+Treg-cells showed no significant alteration by HLA-G treatment. The novel therapeutic approach using recombinant HLA-G5 reported herein demonstrates a significant immunosuppressive effect in this model of allogenic experimental intestinal transplantation. This effect may be mediated via inhibition of recipient-derived CD8+ T-cell populations either directly or by induction of non-classical Treg populations."
https://openalex.org/W2466298851,"In this study, we examined the possibility of introducing methotrexate (MTX) to the carboxylate rather than to the ε-amino side chains of proteins. We found that MTX-amino compounds covalently linked to the carboxylate moieties of macromolecules, undergo unusual peptide-bond cleavage, with the release of the MTX amino derivatives from the conjugates. This event takes place at an accelerated rate under acidic conditions, and at a slower rate at physiological pH values. The glutamate portion of MTX is responsible for this behavior, with little or no contribution of the p-aminobenzoate-pteridine ring that is linked to the α-amino side chain of the glutamate. Carboxylate-linked Fmoc-Glu-γ-CONH-(CH2)6-NH2 undergoes hydrolysis in a nearly indistinguishable fashion. A free α carboxylate moiety is essential for this effect. Carboxylate linked Fmoc-glutamic-amide-γ-CONH-(CH2)6-NH2 undergoes no hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Based on these findings, we engineered a cysteine specific MTX containing reagent. Its linkage to bovine serum albumin (BSA) yielded a conjugate with profound antiproliferative efficacy in a MTX-sensitive glioma cell line. In conclusion, carboxylate linked MTX-amino derivatives in particular, and carboxylate linked R-α-GLU-γ amino compounds in general are equipped with'built-in chemical machinery' that releases them under mild acidic conditions."
