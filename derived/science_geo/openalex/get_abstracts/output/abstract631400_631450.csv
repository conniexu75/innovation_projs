https://openalex.org/W2938973274,"The intestinal immune system has the challenging task of tolerating foreign nutrients and the commensal microbiome, while excluding or eliminating ingested pathogens. Failure of this balance leads to conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, food allergies and invasive gastrointestinal infections1. Multiple immune mechanisms are therefore in place to maintain tissue integrity, including balanced generation of effector T (TH) cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T (pTreg) cells, which mediate resistance to pathogens and regulate excessive immune activation, respectively1–4. The gut-draining lymph nodes (gLNs) are key sites for orchestrating adaptive immunity to luminal perturbations5–7. However, it is unclear how they simultaneously support tolerogenic and inflammatory reactions. Here we show that gLNs are immunologically specific to the functional gut segment that they drain. Stromal and dendritic cell gene signatures and polarization of T cells against the same luminal antigen differ between gLNs, with the proximal small intestine-draining gLNs preferentially giving rise to tolerogenic responses and the distal gLNs to pro-inflammatory T cell responses. This segregation permitted the targeting of distal gLNs for vaccination and the maintenance of duodenal pTreg cell induction during colonic infection. Conversely, the compartmentalized dichotomy was perturbed by surgical removal of select distal gLNs and duodenal infection, with effects on both lymphoid organ and tissue immune responses. Our findings reveal that the conflict between tolerogenic and inflammatory intestinal responses is in part resolved by discrete gLN drainage, and encourage antigen targeting to specific gut segments for therapeutic immune modulation. Immune responses in the gut and associated draining lymph nodes differ between tolerogenic and inflammatory depending on their anatomical location."

https://openalex.org/W2806698583,"The neural mechanisms mediating sensory-guided decision-making have received considerable attention, but animals often pursue behaviors for which there is currently no sensory evidence. Such behaviors are guided by internal representations of choice values that have to be maintained even when these choices are unavailable. We investigated how four macaque monkeys maintained representations of the value of counterfactual choices—choices that could not be taken at the current moment but which could be taken in the future. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found two different patterns of activity co-varying with values of counterfactual choices in a circuit spanning the hippocampus, the anterior lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Anterior cingulate cortex activity also reflected whether the internal value representations would be translated into actual behavioral change. To establish the causal importance of the anterior cingulate cortex for this translation process, we used a novel technique, transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation, to reversibly disrupt anterior cingulate cortex activity. Fouragnan et al. used neuroimaging and ultrasound neuromodution in non-human primates to demonstrate the causal role of the anterior cingulate cortex in translating counterfactual values in future choices."
https://openalex.org/W2935839572,"Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is critical to initiation and perpetuation of disease in multiple sclerosis (MS). We report an interaction between oligodendroglia and vasculature in MS that distinguishes human white matter injury from normal rodent demyelinating injury. We find perivascular clustering of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in certain active MS lesions, representing an inability to properly detach from vessels following perivascular migration. Perivascular OPCs can themselves disrupt the BBB, interfering with astrocyte endfeet and endothelial tight junction integrity, resulting in altered vascular permeability and an associated CNS inflammation. Aberrant Wnt tone in OPCs mediates their dysfunctional vascular detachment and also leads to OPC secretion of Wif1, which interferes with Wnt ligand function on endothelial tight junction integrity. Evidence for this defective oligodendroglial-vascular interaction in MS suggests that aberrant OPC perivascular migration not only impairs their lesion recruitment but can also act as a disease perpetuator via disruption of the BBB."
https://openalex.org/W2935758675,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 schizophrenia (SCZ)-associated loci, but using these findings to illuminate disease biology remains a challenge. Here we present integrative risk gene selector (iRIGS), a Bayesian framework that integrates multi-omics data and gene networks to infer risk genes in GWAS loci. By applying iRIGS to SCZ GWAS data, we predicted a set of high-confidence risk genes, most of which are not the nearest genes to the GWAS index variants. High-confidence risk genes account for a significantly enriched heritability, as estimated by stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression. Moreover, high-confidence risk genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissues, especially prenatally, and are enriched for targets of approved drugs, suggesting opportunities to reposition existing drugs for SCZ. Thus, iRIGS can leverage accumulating functional genomics and GWAS data to advance our understanding of SCZ etiology and potential therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2938511997,"Precise control of plant stem cell proliferation is necessary for the continuous and reproducible development of plant organs1,2. The peptide ligand CLAVATA3 (CLV3) and its receptor protein kinase CLAVATA1 (CLV1) maintain stem cell homeostasis within a deeply conserved negative feedback circuit1,2. In Arabidopsis, CLV1 paralogs also contribute to homeostasis, by compensating for the loss of CLV1 through transcriptional upregulation3. Here, we show that compensation4,5 operates in diverse lineages for both ligands and receptors, but while the core CLV signaling module is conserved, compensation mechanisms have diversified. Transcriptional compensation between ligand paralogs operates in tomato, facilitated by an ancient gene duplication that impacted the domestication of fruit size. In contrast, we found little evidence for transcriptional compensation between ligands in Arabidopsis and maize, and receptor compensation differs between tomato and Arabidopsis. Our findings show that compensation among ligand and receptor paralogs is critical for stem cell homeostasis, but that diverse genetic mechanisms buffer conserved developmental programs. A study of a stem cell receptor–ligand signaling module across tomato, maize and Arabidopsis identifies different genetic mechanisms of compensation that contribute to homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2938457075,"Targeted killing of pathogenic bacteria without harming beneficial members of host microbiota holds promise as a strategy to cure disease and limit both antimicrobial-related dysbiosis and development of antimicrobial resistance. We engineer toxins that are split by inteins and deliver them by conjugation into a mixed population of bacteria. Our toxin-intein antimicrobial is only activated in bacteria that harbor specific transcription factors. We apply our antimicrobial to specifically target and kill antibiotic-resistant Vibrio cholerae present in mixed populations. We find that 100% of antibiotic-resistant V. cholerae receiving the plasmid are killed. Escape mutants were extremely rare (10-6-10-8). We show that conjugation and specific killing of targeted bacteria occurs in the microbiota of zebrafish and crustacean larvae, which are natural hosts for Vibrio spp. Toxins split with inteins could form the basis of precision antimicrobials to target pathogens that are antibiotic resistant."
https://openalex.org/W2937526827,"The honeybee (Apis mellifera) has to cope with multiple environmental stressors, especially pesticides. Among those, the herbicide glyphosate and its main metabolite, the aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), are among the most abundant and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment. Through the foraging and storing of contaminated resources, honeybees are exposed to these xenobiotics. As ingested glyphosate and AMPA are directly in contact with the honeybee gut microbiota, we used quantitative PCR to test whether they could induce significant changes in the relative abundance of the major gut bacterial taxa. Glyphosate induced a strong decrease in Snodgrassella alvi, a partial decrease of a Gilliamella apicola and an increase in Lactobacillus spp. abundances. In vitro, glyphosate reduced the growth of S. alvi and G. apicola but not Lactobacillus kunkeei. Although being no bee killer, we confirmed that glyphosate can have sublethal effects on the honeybee microbiota. To test whether such imbalanced microbiota could favor pathogen development, honeybees were exposed to glyphosate and to spores of the intestinal parasite Nosema ceranae. Glyphosate did not significantly enhance the effect of the parasite infection. Concerning AMPA, while it could reduce the growth of G. apicola in vitro, it did not induce any significant change in the honeybee microbiota, suggesting that glyphosate is the active component modifying the gut communities."
https://openalex.org/W2936734599,"BMP/SMAD signaling is a crucial regulator of intestinal differentiation1-4. However, the molecular underpinnings of the BMP pathway in this context are unknown. Here, we characterize the mechanism by which BMP/SMAD signaling drives enterocyte differentiation. We establish that the transcription factor HNF4A acts redundantly with an intestine-restricted HNF4 paralog, HNF4G, to activate enhancer chromatin and upregulate the majority of transcripts enriched in the differentiated epithelium; cells fail to differentiate on double knockout of both HNF4 paralogs. Furthermore, we show that SMAD4 and HNF4 function via a reinforcing feed-forward loop, activating each other's expression and co-binding to regulatory elements of differentiation genes. This feed-forward regulatory module promotes and stabilizes enterocyte cell identity; disruption of the HNF4-SMAD4 module results in loss of enterocyte fate in favor of progenitor and secretory cell lineages. This intersection of signaling and transcriptional control provides a framework to understand regenerative tissue homeostasis, particularly in tissues with inherent cellular plasticity5."

https://openalex.org/W2804787479,"Microscopic features (that is, microstructure) of axons affect neural circuit activity through characteristics such as conduction speed. To what extent axonal microstructure in white matter relates to functional connectivity (synchrony) between brain regions is largely unknown. Using MRI data in 11,354 subjects, we constructed multivariate models that predict functional connectivity of pairs of brain regions from the microstructural signature of white matter pathways that connect them. Microstructure-derived models provided predictions of functional connectivity that explained 3.5% of cross-subject variance on average (ranging from 1-13%, or r = 0.1-0.36) and reached statistical significance in 90% of the brain regions considered. The microstructure-function relationships were associated with genetic variants, co-located with genes DAAM1 and LPAR1, that have previously been linked to neural development. Our results demonstrate that variation in white matter microstructure predicts a fraction of functional connectivity across individuals, and that this relationship is underpinned by genetic variability in certain brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2938594738,"This study aimed to investigate whether changes in psychosocial factors and pain severity were associated with reduction in disability due to pain among patients with chronic pain. We hypothesized that increased self-efficacy would reduce disability.This longitudinal observational study included 72 patients. Patients' psychological and physical variables were assessed before and after 3 months of treatment. Demographic and clinical information were collected, including the Pain Disability Assessment Scale (PDAS), the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale, and the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to assess pain intensity. First, univariate regression analyses were conducted to clarify associations between change in PDAS and sex, age, pain duration, changes in psychosocial factors (self-efficacy, anxiety, and depression) and change in pain intensity. Second, multivariate regression was conducted using the variables identified in the univariate analyses (PSEQ and NRS) to detect the most relevant factor for reducing disability.Univariate regression analyses clarified that changes in PSEQ (β = -0.31; 95% CI: -0.54--0.08, p = 0.008) and NRS (β = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.47, p = 0.04) were associated with reduction in PDAS. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that change in PSEQ (β = 0.26; 95% CI: -0.50--0.02; p = 0.01) was associated with a reduction in disability, independent of change in NRS.These findings suggest improved self-efficacy is associated with reduced disability in patients with chronic pain, independent of reduction in pain intensity. Focusing on improvement in self-efficacy may be an effective strategy in chronic pain treatment in addition to pain relief."
https://openalex.org/W2939286226,"Aim Many older medical patients experience persistent functional limitations after hospitalization, such as dependency in activities of daily living, recurring fall incidents and increased mortality. Therefore, increased activity and mobilization during hospitalization are essential to prevent functional decline in older medical patients. No previous studies have explored how the social context influences how health professionals decide whether or not to mobilize patients. This qualitative study aimed to explore how social contextual circumstances affect the mobility of older medical patients in medical departments. Methods An ethnographic field study was conducted in six medical departments in three public hospitals in the capital region of Copenhagen, Denmark. Participant observations were carried out from January to June 2017. The researchers were present for up to 14 days (range, 8–14 days) in the six departments. A total of 210 pages of field notes were produced. The participants were health professionals involved in the care of older medical patients: physiotherapists, registered nurses, nursing assistants and physicians. A content analysis was conducted. Findings Five themes concerning mobility of patients emerged: (1) materialities; (2) professional roles; (3) encouraging moments; (4) patients and relatives; and (5) organization and management. Of these, professional roles seem to be the most important because it pervaded all themes. Different health professionals in the medical departments recognized, spoke and acted based on different cultural models. Conclusion It was found that mobility of older medical patients is entangled in a complex network of social contextual circumstances. Mobility of older medical patients is based on health professionals’ different cultural models, which shape distinct professional identities and lead to contradictions and blurring of the priorities and responsibilities among the health professionals involved in mobilization. The consequence is that no profession “owns” the responsibility for mobilization, thus restricting mobilization of the patients during hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W2962960039,"Here we show a method of directing the edges of the connectomes, prepared from HARDI datasets from the human brain. Before the present work, no high-definition directed braingraphs were published, because the tractography methods in use are not capable of assigning directions to the neural tracts discovered. Previous work on the functional connectomes applied low-resolution functional MRI-detected statistical causality for the assignment of directions of connectomes of typically several dozens of vertices. Our method is based on the phenomenon of the “Consensus Connectome Dynamics”, described earlier by our research group. In this contribution, we apply the method to the 423 braingraphs, each with 1015 vertices, computed from the public release of the Human Connectome Project, and we also made the directed connectomes publicly available at the site http://braingraph.org. We also show the robustness of our edge directing method in four independently chosen connectome datasets: we have found that 86% of the edges, which were present in all four datasets, get the same directions in all datasets; therefore the direction method is robust. While our new edge-directing method still needs more empirical validation, we think that our present contribution opens up new possibilities in the analysis of the high-definition human connectome."
https://openalex.org/W2938601959,"Background The management of mentally ill offenders in the community is one of the great challenges imposed on community psychiatry. Aim The aim of this study was to analyze the association between sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors and violent behavior in a sample of outpatients with severe mental disorders. Method This was a prospective cohort study with a baseline cross-sectional design used to provide a detailed analysis of patients’ profiles, followed by a longitudinal design to measure aggressive and violent behavior during a 1-year follow-up. Patients with severe mental disorders, with or without a history of violence, were enrolled in four Italian Departments of Mental Health and underwent a comprehensive multidimensional assessment. Results The sample included 247 outpatients, for a total of 126 cases and 121 controls. Compared to controls, patients with a history of violence had a greater frequency of lifetime domestic violence, a greater lifetime propensity to misuse substances, and a higher number of compulsory admissions. The forthnightly monitoring during the 1-year follow-up did show statistically significant differences in aggressive and violent behavior rates between the two groups. Verbal aggression was significantly associated with aggression against objects and physical aggression. Moreover, outpatients with an history of violence showed statistically significant higher MOAS scores compared to both residential patients with an history of violence, assessed in the first wave of this project, and all controls. Conclusions Patients with a history of violence had specific characteristics and showed a greater occurrence of additional community violence during a 1-year observation period. Our results may assist clinicians in implementing standardized methods of patient assessment and violence monitoring in outpatient mental health services and may prompt improved collaboration between different community services."
https://openalex.org/W2939350602,"Bacteria and their bacteriophages coexist and coevolve for the benefit of both in a mutualistic association. Multiple mechanisms are used by bacteria to resist phages in a trade-off between survival and maintenance of fitness. In vitro studies allow inquiring into the fate of virus and host in different conditions aimed at mimicking natural environment. We analyse here the mutations emerging in a clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain in response to infection by Ab09, a N4-like lytic podovirus and describe a variety of chromosomal deletions and mutations conferring resistance. Some deletions result from illegitimate recombination taking place during long-term maintenance of the phage genome. Phage variants with mutations in a tail fiber gene are selected during pseudolysogeny with the capacity to infect resistant cells and produce large plaques. These results highlight the complex host/phage association and suggest that phage Ab09 promotes bacterial chromosome rearrangements. Finally this study points to the possible role of two bacterial genes in Ab09 phage adhesion to the cell, rpsB encoding protein S2 of the 30S ribosomal subunit and ORF1587 encoding a Wzy-like membrane protein involved in LPS biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2940269419,"Road Detection is a basic task in automated driving field, in which 3D lidar data is commonly used recently. In this paper, we propose to rearrange 3D lidar data into a new organized form to construct direct spatial relationship among point cloud, and put forward new features for real-time road detection tasks. Our model works based on two prerequisites: (1) Road regions are always flatter than non-road regions. (2) Light travels in straight lines in a uniform medium. Based on prerequisite 1, we put forward difference-between-lines feature, while ScanID density and obstacle radial map are generated based on prerequisite 2. According to our method, we construct an array of structures to store and reorganize 3D input firstly. Then, two novel features, difference-between-lines and ScanID density, are extracted, based on which we construct a consistency map and an obstacle map in Bird Eye View (BEV). Finally, the road region is extracted by fusing these two maps and refinement is used to polish up our outcome. We have carried out experiments on the public KITTI-Road benchmark, achieving one of the best performances among the lidar-based road detection methods. To further prove the efficiency of our method on unstructured road, the visual outcomes in rural areas are also proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2938797196,"The purpose of this study was to improve the solubility of resveratrol (Res) by a self-microemulsifying drug-delivery system (SMEDDS). Through a solubility experiment, the pseudoternary phase diagram and ternary phase diagram were used to optimize the Res SMEDDS formula. The optimum formulation consisted of 5% IPM, 20% PEG400, and 65% Cremophor RH40. The water solubility, stability, in vitro release and antioxidant activity of the Res SMEDDS were characterized. The Res solubility in the SMEDDS was at least 1,000 times compared to that in water. The average droplet size of the microemulsion was 28.00±1.67 nm and uniform distribution. The Res SMEDDS should be stored at low temperature and in the dark to avoid light conditions. Res SMEDDS was able to improve the in vitro release rate of Res, and the in vitro release of Res from Res SMEDDS was significantly faster that of Res powder and unaffected by pH value of media. Antioxidant assays showed that antioxidant activities of Res in Res SMEDDS were unaffected compared to Res powder. Cytotoxicity study indicated that Res SMEDDS at the concentration of less than 100 μM was safe. These results demonstrated the potential use of Res SMEDDS for oral administration of Res."
https://openalex.org/W2940424811,"Early ripening apples are usually used for fresh marketing because of short storage life, although they are with high acid and low sugar contents. Understanding the malate metabolism in fleshy fruit and underpinning process during ripening is crucial for particular crop improvement where acidity is a concern for direct consumption or further processing. In this research, a traditional Chinese apple cultivar ‘Hongyu’, which belongs to early ripening apple cultivar, were freshly harvested at commercial maturity stage (120 Days after full bloom) and used for different storage temperature (4°C, 20°C) and UV-C treatment (following storage at 20°C after treatment). Simple sugars (glucose, sucrose, and fructose) and organic acids (malic, and oxalic) were assessed after 14 d of storage. Compared to fruits stored at 20°C, the malate content in fruits stored at 4°C significantly higher, while it was decreased significantly in UV-C treated fruits stored at 20°C after 14 d of storage. The sugar content was almost similar throughout the UV-C-treated fruits and fruits stored at different temperature. The higher ratios of total sugars to total organic acids in UV-C treated fruits after 14 d suggest that UV-C treatment has the potential to improve the taste of early ripening apple cultivars. Considering the significant difference in malate the samples at 14 d of storage were subjected for RNA-seq analysis. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the phenomena underlying this change were governed by metabolism of malate by the regulation of NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PEPCK) in apple during postharvest storage. This transcriptome profiling results have specified the transcript regulation of malate metabolism and lead to possible taste improvement without affecting the other fruit quality attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2937582255,"Habitual loading and resistance training (RT) can lead to changes in muscle and tendon morphology as well as in its mechanical properties which can be measured by Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) technique. The objective of this study was to analyze the Vastus Lateralis (VL) and patellar tendon (PT) mechanical properties adaptations to an 8-week RT protocol using SWE. We submitted 15 untrained health young men to an 8-week RT directed for knee extensor mechanism. VL and PT shear modulus (μ) were assessed pre and post intervention with SWE. PT thickness (PTT), VL muscle thickness (VL MT) and knee extension torque (KT) were also measure pre and post intervention to ensure the RT efficiency. Significant increases were observed in VL MT and KT (pre = 2.40 ± 0.40 cm and post = 2.63 ± 0.35 cm, p = 0.0111, and pre = 294.66 ± 73.98 Nm and post = 338.93 ± 76.39 Nm, p = 0.005, respectively). The 8-week RT was also effective in promoting VL μ adaptations (pre = 4.87 ± 1.38 kPa and post = 9.08.12 ± 1.86 kPa, p = 0.0105), but not in significantly affecting PT μ (pre = 78.85 ± 7.37 kPa and post = 66.41 ± 7.25 kPa, p = 0.1287) nor PTT (baseline = 0.364 ± 0.053 cm and post = 0.368 ± 0.046 cm, p = 0.71). The present study showed that an 8-week resistance training protocol was effective in adapting VL μ but not PT μ. Further investigation should be conducted with special attention to longer interventions, to possible PT differential individual responsiveness and to the muscle-tendon resting state tension environment."
https://openalex.org/W2937996936,"In the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations worldwide pledged emissions reductions (Nationally Determined Contributions—NDCs) to avert the threat of climate change, and agreed to periodically review these pledges to strengthen their level of ambition. Previous studies have analyzed NDCs largely in terms of their implied contribution to limit global warming, their implications on the energy sector or on mitigation costs. Nevertheless, a gap in the literature exists regarding the understanding of implications of the NDCs on countries’ Energy-Water-Land nexus resource systems. The present paper explores this angle within the regional context of Latin America by employing the Global Change Assessment Model, a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model capable of representing key system-wide interactions among nexus sectors and mitigation policies. By focusing on Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, we stress potential implications on national-level water demands depending on countries’ strategies to enforce energy-related emissions reductions and their interplays with the land sector. Despite the differential implications of the Paris pledges on each country, increased water demands for crop and biomass irrigation and for electricity generation stand out as potential trade-offs that may emerge under the NDC policy. Hence, this study underscores the need of considering a nexus resource planning framework (known as “Nexus Approach”) in the forthcoming NDCs updating cycles as a mean to contribute toward sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W2937778526,"Based on electrohysterogram, this paper designed a new method using wavelet-based nonlinear features and stacked sparse autoencoder for preterm birth detection. For each sample, three level wavelet decomposition of a time series was performed. Approximation coefficients at level 3 and detail coefficients at levels 1, 2 and 3 were extracted. Sample entropy of the detail coefficients at levels 1, 2, 3 and approximation coefficients at level 3 were computed as features. The classifier was constructed based on stacked sparse autoencoder. In addition, stacked sparse autoencoder was further compared with extreme learning machine and support vector machine in relation to their classification performance of electrohysterogram. The experiment results reveal that classifier based on stacked sparse autoencoder showed better performance than the other two classifiers with an accuracy of 90%, a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 88%. The results indicate that the method proposed in this paper could be effective for detecting preterm birth in electrohysterogram and the framework designed in this work presents higher discriminability than other techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2938258221,"The production of concrete for construction purposes is a major source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. One promising avenue towards a more sustainable construction industry is to make use of naturally occurring mineral-microbe interactions, such as microbial-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP), to produce solid materials. In this paper, we present a new process where calcium carbonate in the form of powdered limestone is transformed to a binder material (termed BioZEment) through microbial dissolution and recrystallization. For the dissolution step, a suitable bacterial strain, closely related to Bacillus pumilus, was isolated from soil near a limestone quarry. We show that this strain produces organic acids from glucose, inducing the dissolution of calcium carbonate in an aqueous slurry of powdered limestone. In the second step, the dissolved limestone solution is used as the calcium source for MICP in sand packed syringe moulds. The amounts of acid produced and calcium carbonate dissolved are shown to depend on the amount of available oxygen as well as the degree of mixing. Precipitation is induced through the pH increase caused by the hydrolysis of urea, mediated by the enzyme urease, which is produced in situ by the bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii DSM33. The degree of successful consolidation of sand by BioZEment was found to depend on both the amount of urea and the amount of glucose available in the dissolution reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2938803118,"The aim of this study was to measure the movement of the cervical spine in healthy volunteers and patients with cervical spondylosis (CS) and describe the actual motion of the cervical spine using a three-dimensional (3D) CT reconstruction method. The results can enrich current biomechanical data of cervical spine and help to find the differences between the noted two groups.20 healthy volunteers underwent CT examination ranging from the clivus of the occiput (Oc) to the top of first thoracic vertebrae (T1) in a neutral position with left or right maximal axial rotation, while 26 CS patients received the same CT scan procedures in the neutral position with left and right maximum rotation. Subsequently, the three-dimensional images of the occiput and every cervical vertebrae (C1-C7) were reconstructed using medical software. 3 virtual non-collinear markers were placed on the prominent structures of foramen magnum and every cervical vertebrae. Then, the 3D orthogonal spatial coordinates were defined with these anatomical markers to represent the orientation and position of every vertebra. Segmental relative motions were calculated using Cardan angles in the 3D spatial coordinates. Finally, the differences between the two groups were analyzed with statistical software SPSS.The cervical spine exhibited complicated 3D movements, which could be adequately described using the three-dimensional CT reconstruction method. Reliability analysis of the 3D CT reconstruction method showed inter-rater ICC of 0.90-0.99 and intra-rater ICC of 0.91-0.98, suggesting very good consistency. Besides, the rotation at the upper cervical spine (Oc-C2) took up at least 60% of the total cervical rotation. The coupled lateral bending movement of the upper cervical spine was opposite to the major motion, while the movement of the lower cervical spine followed the same direction as that of the major motion. Oc to C5 segments were all coupled with the back-extension movement. The relative translations of all adjacent segments in each direction were minimal. CS patients showed a significant decrease in the movement of the C4-C5 segment compared with healthy volunteers.The motion of the cervical spine was complicated and three-dimensional. The CT reconstruction method employed here was good at describing such movement. The 3D CT reconstruction method exhibited high reproducibility when measuring cervical spine movement. CS patients and healthy volunteers showed significant differences in the movement of some segments."
https://openalex.org/W2937193496,"The production of concrete is one of the most significant contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. This work focuses on bio-cementation-based products and their potential to reduce global warming potential (GWP). In particular, we address a proposed bio-cementation method employing bacterial metabolism in a two-step process of limestone dissolution and recrystallisation (BioZEment). A scenario-based techno-economic analysis (TEA) is combined with a life cycle assessment (LCA), a market model and a literature review of consumers’ willingness to pay, to compute the expected reduction of global GWP. Based on the LCA, the GWP of 1 ton of BioZEment is found to be 70–83% lower than conventional concrete. In the TEA, three scenarios are investigated: brick, precast and onsite production. The results indicate that brick production may be the easiest way to implement the products, but that due to high cost, the impact on global GWP will be marginal. For precast production the expected 10% higher material cost of BioZEment only produces a marginal increase in total cost. Thus, precast production has the potential to reduce global GWP from concrete production by 0–20%. Significant technological hurdles remain before BioZEment-based products can be used in onsite construction scenarios, but in this scenario, the potential GWP reduction ranges from 1 to 26%. While the potential to reduce global GWP is substantial, significant efforts need to be made both in regard to public acceptance and production methods for this potential to be unlocked."
https://openalex.org/W2938754949,"People's daily travels are structured and can be expressed as networks. Few studies explore how people organize their daily travels and which behavioral principles result in the choices of specific network types. In this study, we first reconstruct location networks and activity networks for numerous individuals from high-resolution mobile phone positioning data and define frequent networks as motifs. The results suggest that 99.9% of people's travels can be characterized by a limited set of location-based motifs and activity-based motifs. The results further reveal that the least effort principle governs the preferred motif choices through quantifying the rank-frequency properties. The scaling properties of distance characteristically impact motifs, and their scaling differences by node numbers and motif types coincide with the popularities of motifs, verifying the self-adaptions in motif choices; that is, although individuals travel with unique propensities, they always tend to choose the motif with the lowest consumption that satisfies their demand."
https://openalex.org/W2938277762,"Epigenetic regulating proteins like histone methyltransferases produce variations in several functions, some of them associated with the generation of oncogenic processes. Mutations of genes involved in these functions have been recently associated with cancer, and strategies to modulate their activity are currently in clinical development.By using data extracted from the METABRIC study, we searched for mutated genes linked with detrimental outcome in invasive breast carcinoma (n = 772). Then, we used downstream signatures for each mutated gene to associate that signature with clinical prognosis using the online tool ""Genotype-2-Outcome"" (http://www.g-2-o.com). Next, we performed functional annotation analyses to classify genes by functions, and focused on those associated with the epigenetic machinery.We identified KMT2D, SETD1A and SETD2, included in the lysine methyltransferase activity function, as linked with poor prognosis in invasive breast cancer. KMT2D which codes for a histone methyltransferase that acts as a transcriptional regulator was mutated in 6% of triple negative breast tumors and found to be linked to poor survival. Genes regulated by KMT2D included RAC3, KRT23, or KRT14, among others, which are involved in cell communication and signal transduction. Finally, low expression of KMT2D at the transcriptomic level, which mirror what happens when KMT2D is mutated and functionally inactive, confirmed its prognostic value.In the present work, we describe epigenetic modulating genes which are found to be mutated in breast cancer. We identify the histone methyltransferase KMT2D, which is mutated in 6% of triple negative tumors and linked with poor survival."

Yet, due to the lack of adequate in situ measurements, the detection of HABs in coastal marine ecosystems remains challenging. Sensors on-board satellite platforms have sampled the Earth synoptically for decades, offering an alternative, cost-effective approach to routinely detect and monitor phytoplankton. The Red Sea, a large marine ecosystem characterised by extensive coral reefs, high levels of biodiversity and endemism, and a growing aquaculture industry, is one such region where knowledge of HABs is limited. Here, using high-resolution satellite remote sensing observations (1km, MODIS-Aqua) and a second-order derivative approach, in conjunction with available in situ datasets, we investigate for the first time the capability of a remote sensing model to detect and monitor HABs in the Red Sea. The model is able to successfully detect and generate maps of HABs associated with different phytoplankton functional types, matching concurrent in situ data remarkably well. We also acknowledge the limitations of using a remote-sensing based approach and show that regardless of a HAB’s spatial coverage, the model is only capable of detecting the presence of a HAB when the Chl-a concentrations exceed a minimum value of ~ 1 mg m-3. Despite the difficulties in detecting HABs at lower concentrations, and identifying species toxicity levels (only possible through in situ measurements), the proposed method has the potential to map the reported spatial distribution of several HAB species over the last two decades. Such information is essential for the regional economy (i.e., aquaculture, fisheries & tourism), and will support the management and sustainability of the Red Sea’s coastal economic zone."
https://openalex.org/W2938696276,"The amount of practice and time interval between practice sessions are important factors that influence motor learning efficiency. Here, we aimed to reveal the relationship between the retention and consolidation of a new internal model, and the amount of practice and time interval between practice sessions. We employed a visuomotor rotation tracking task to test the hypotheses that (1) a new internal model consolidates owing to extensive practice after reaching a task performance plateau and (2) a longer time interval between practice sessions makes it difficult to activate a new internal model. The participants were assigned to one of the four groups that differed in terms of the amount of practice and the time interval between practice sessions. They performed a tracking task in which they experienced 120° clockwise visuomotor rotation and were required to track a moving target on a computer display using a mouse cursor. To evaluate the retention and consolidation of a new internal model, we calculated the aftereffects and savings as measures of motor learning. To the best our knowledge, this is the first study to manipulate both the amount of practice and the time interval between practice sessions simultaneously in one experiment using a visuomotor tracking task. Our results support the previously reported idea that extensive practice is necessary for the consolidation of a new internal model."
https://openalex.org/W2936817087,"The infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) is an important pathogen on farmed salmon in Europe. The virus occurs as low- and high virulent variants where the former seem to be a continuous source of new high virulent ISAV. The latter are controlled in Norway by stamping out infected populations while the former are spreading uncontrolled among farmed salmon. Evidence of vertical transmission has been presented, but there is still an ongoing discussion of the importance of circulation of ISAV via salmon brood fish. The only known wild reservoirs are in trout (Salmo trutta) and salmon (Salmo salar). This study provides the first ISAV sequences from wild salmonids in Norway and evaluates the importance of this reservoir with respect to outbreaks of ISA among farmed salmon. Phylogenetic analyses of the surface protein hemagglutinin-esterase gene from nearly all available ISAV from Norway, Faeroe Islands, Scotland, Chile and wild salmonids in Norway show that they group into four major clades. Including virulent variants in the analysis show that they belong in the same four clades supporting the hypothesis that there is a high frequency of transition from low to high virulent variants in farmed populations of salmon. There is little support for a hypothesis suggesting that the wild salmonids feed the virus into farmed populations. This study give support to earlier studies that have documented local horizontal transmission of high virulent ISAV, but the importance of transition from low- to high virulent variants has been underestimated. Evidence of vertical transmission and long distance spreading of ISAV via movement of embryos and smolt is presented. We recommend that the industry focus on removing the low virulent ISAV from the brood fish and that ISAV-free brood fish salmon are kept in closed containment systems (CCS)."

The birth of the hybrid was registered in the Bay of Algeciras (southern Spain) in August 2016, and the animal has been tracked on frequent trips aboard dolphin-watching platforms. This unique occurrence is the result of an apparent ongoing interaction (10 years) between a female bottlenose dolphin and common dolphins. The calf has a robust body with length similar to Tursiops, while its lateral striping and coloration are typical of Delphinus. It displays the common dolphin’s ‘criss-cross’ pattern. However, the thoracic patch is lighter than in D. delphis and its dorsal area is light grey, with a ‘V’ shape under the dorsal fin. This paper also provides a comprehensive mini-review of hybridizations of T. truncatus with other species."
https://openalex.org/W2938876870,"Human gait has been shown to be an effective biometric measure for person identification at a distance. On the other hand, changes in the view angle pose a major challenge for gait recognition as human gait silhouettes are usually different from different view angles. Traditionally, such a multi-view gait recognition problem can be tackled by View Transformation Model (VTM) which transforms gait features from multiple gallery views to the probe view so as to evaluate the gait similarity. In the real-world environment, however, gait sequences may be captured from an uncontrolled scene and the view angle is often unknown, dynamically changing, or does not belong to any predefined views (thus VTM becomes inapplicable). To address this free-view gait recognition problem, we propose an innovative view-adaptive mapping (VAM) approach. The VAM employs a novel walking trajectory fitting (WTF) to estimate the view angles of a gait sequence, and a joint gait manifold (JGM) to find the optimal manifold between the probe data and relevant gallery data for gait similarity evaluation. Additionally, a RankSVM-based algorithm is developed to supplement the gallery data for subjects whose gallery features are only available in predefined views. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the VAM outperforms several reference methods remarkably in free-view gait recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2936395492,"In case-control studies, population controls can help ensure generalizability; however, the selection of population controls can be challenging in environments that lack population registries. We developed a population enumeration and sampling strategy to facilitate use of population controls in a breast cancer case-control study conducted in Ghana.Household enumeration was conducted in 110 census-defined geographic areas within Ghana's Ashanti, Central, Eastern, and Greater Accra Regions. A pool of potential controls (women aged 18 to 74 years, never diagnosed with breast cancer) was selected from the enumeration using systematic random sampling and frequency-matched to the anticipated distributions of age and residence among cases. Multiple attempts were made to contact potential controls to assess eligibility and arrange for study participation. To increase participation, we implemented a refusal conversion protocol in which initial non-participants were re-approached after several months.2,528 women were sampled from the enumeration listing, 2,261 (89%) were successfully contacted, and 2,106 were enrolled (overall recruitment of 83%). 170 women were enrolled through refusal conversion. Compared with women enrolled after being first approached, refusal conversion enrollees were younger and less likely to complete the study interview in the study hospital (13% vs. 23%). The most common reasons for non-participation were lack of interest and lack of time.Using household enumeration and repeated contacts, we were able to recruit population controls with a high participation rate. Our approach may provide a blue-print for others undertaking epidemiologic studies in populations that lack accessible population registries."
https://openalex.org/W2940289202,"In Japan, the increasing number of patients needing emergency medical care due to population aging is a major public health problem. Recently, emergency medicine in Japan has seen a growth in the number of Dedicated Emergency Physician Model style departments. We aimed to determine whether there is an association between Dedicated Emergency Physician Model emergency care and pre-hospital transportation time. We conducted a secondary analysis of a Japanese national pre-hospital database from 2010 to 2014. Three regions (group 1: Urayasu city and Ichikawa city in Chiba prefecture, group 2: Kamakura city, Chigasaki city, Fujisawa city and Zushi city in Kanagawa prefecture, and group 3: Fukui city in Fukui prefecture) were evaluated as Dedicated Emergency Physician Model emergency medicine areas. We compared transportation times in these areas with all municipalities in the same prefectures, and with a nearby area using multivariate linear regression with cluster adjustment. The variables used for adjustment are the time from Emergency Medical Services activation to the scene, month, day of the month, day of the week, time of day, age, gender, type of injury, severity, and location of call. Compared with all municipalities in each prefecture there were significant reductions in pre-hospital transportation time: 4.2 minutes (95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 7.5, p<0.05) in Group 1, 6.2 minutes (95%CI, 2.9 to 9.6, p<0.01) fin Group 2 and 7.5 minutes (95%CI, 6.0 to 9.0, p<0.01) in Group 3. Compared with nearby areas, there were statistically significant reductions in transportation time in Group 1, 6.8 minutes (95%CI, 0.7 to 12.8, p<0.05) and in Group 2, 6.8 minutes (95%CI, 3.7 to 9.9, p<0.05). There was a trend for reduced transportation time in Group 3, 2.3 minutes, (5.3 to -0.6, p<0.1). Areas with a Dedicated Emergency Physician Model are associated with reduced pre-hospital transportation time."
https://openalex.org/W2935735847,"A resurgence of scarlet fever has caused many pediatric infections in East Asia and the United Kingdom. Although scarlet fever in Taiwan has not been a notifiable infectious disease since 2007, the comprehensive national health insurance data can still track its trend. Here, we used data from the open data portal of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The scarlet fever trend was measured by outpatient and hospitalization rates from 2009 to 2017. In order to elucidate the spatio-temporal hotspots, we developed a new method named the spatio-temporal Gi* statistic, and applied Joinpoint regression to compute the annual percentage change (APC). The overall APCs in outpatient and hospitalization were 15.1% (95% CI: 10.3%-20.2%) and 7.7% (95%CI: 4.5% -10.9%). The major two infected groups were children aged 5-9 (outpatient: 0.138 scarlet fever diagnoses per 1,000 visits; inpatient: 2.579 per 1,000 visits) and aged 3-4 (outpatient: 0.084 per 1,000 visits; inpatient: 1.469 per 1,000 visits). We found the counties in eastern Taiwan and offshore counties had the most hotspots in the outpatient setting. In terms of hospitalization, the hotspots mostly occurred in offshore counties close to China. With the help of the spatio-temporal statistic, health workers can set up enhanced laboratory surveillance in those hotspots."
https://openalex.org/W2938200194,"Background The aim of this study was to investigate whether frequent drinking, use of drugs with addiction potential and the possible combination of frequent drinking and use of prescribed drugs with addiction potential were associated with all-cause mortality in older adults. Methods We used data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT3 2006–08), a population-based study in Norway. A total of 11,545 (6,084 women) individuals 65 years and older at baseline participated. We assessed frequent drinking (≥ 4 days a week), occasional drinking (i.e. a few times a year), never drinking and non-drinking in the last year. Drugs with addiction potential were defined as at least one prescription of benzodiazepines, z-hypnotics or opioids during one year for a minimum of two consecutive years between 2005 and 2009. This information was drawn from the Norwegian Prescription Database. The main outcome was all-cause mortality with information drawn from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Follow-up continued until death or latest at 31 December 2013. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate all-cause mortality since date of study entry and exact age at time of death was unknown. Results The adjusted logistic regression analyses showed that frequent drinking was not associated with all-cause mortality compared to occasional drinking. Men who reported to be never drinkers and non-drinkers in the last year had higher odds of mortality compared to those who drank occasionally. Use of prescribed drugs with addiction potential was associated with increased mortality in men, but not in women. No association was found between the possible combination of frequent drinking and use of prescribed drugs with addiction potential and mortality. Conclusion Neither frequent drinking nor the possible combination of frequent drinking and use of prescribed drugs with addiction potential were associated with all-cause mortality in older women and men. Use of prescribed drugs with addiction potential was associated with higher odds of mortality in men. This finding should lead to more caution in prescribing drugs with addiction potential to this group."
https://openalex.org/W2940341075,"Understanding how music can evoke emotions and in turn affect language use has significant implications not only in clinical settings but also in the emotional development of children. The relationship between music and emotion is an intricate one that has been closely studied. However, how the use of emotion words can be influenced by auditory priming is a question which is still not known. The main interest in this study was to examine how manipulation of mode and tempo in music affects the emotions induced and the subsequent effects on the use of emotion words. Fifty university students in Singapore were asked to select emotion words after exposure to various music excerpts. The results showed that major modes and faster tempos elicited greater responses for positive words and high arousal words respectively, while minor modes elicited more high arousal words and original tempos resulted in more positive words being selected. In the Major-Fast, Major-Slow and Minor-Slow conditions, positive correlations were found between the number of high arousal words and their rated intensities. Upon further analysis, categorization of emotion words differed from the circumplex model. Taken together, the findings highlight the prominence of affective auditory priming and allow us to better understand our emotive responses to music."
https://openalex.org/W2937113811,"Bioengineering, which studies the principles and design of biological systems, is a field that has inspired the development of several technologies that are currently in use. In this work, we use concepts from the fish lateral line sensing mechanism and apply them to seismic imaging processing. The lateral line is a sensory system composed of an integrated array of mechanical sensors spanning along the fish body. We compare the array of sensors along body fish with the seismic acquisition, which employs an array of equally spaced identical mechanical sensors to image the Earth's subsurface. In both situations, the mechanical sensors capture and process mechanical vibrations from the environment to produce useful information. We explore the strategy of using the low-pass and high-pass sensors schema of fish lateral line to improve the seismic technique. We use the full-wave inversion method to compare the conventional acquisition procedure of identical sensors with alternative sets of different sensors, which mimics the fish lateral line. Our results show that the alternate sensors arrangement surpasses the performance of the conventional acquisition method, using just half of the input information. The results point at an image processing technique that is computationally more efficient and economical than the usual seismic processing method."
https://openalex.org/W2935731781,"Cerebral white matter lesions are ischemic symptoms caused mainly by microangiopathy; they are diagnosed by MRI because they show up as abnormalities in MRI images. Because patients with white matter lesions do not have any symptoms, MRI often detects the lesions for the first time. Generally, head MRI for the diagnosis and grading of cerebral white matter lesions is performed as an option during medical checkups in Japan. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for the prediction of white matter lesions using data from routine medical evaluations that do not include a head MRI. Linear discriminant analysis, logistic discrimination, Naive Bayes classifier, support vector machine, and random forest were investigated and evaluated by ten-fold cross-validation, using clinical data for 1,904 examinees (988 males and 916 females) from medical checkups that did include the head MRI. The logistic regression model was selected based on a comparison of accuracy and interpretability. The model variables consisted of age, gender, plaque score (PS), LDL, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and administration of antihypertensive medication (odds ratios: 2.99, 1.57, 1.18, 1.06, 1.12, and 1.52, respectively) and showed Areas Under the ROC Curve (AUC) 0.805, the model displayed sensitivity of 72.0%, and specificity 75.1% when the most appropriate cutoff value was used, 0.579 as given by the Youden Index. This model has shown to be useful to identify patients with a high-risk of cerebral white matter lesions, who can then be diagnosed with a head MRI examination in order to prevent dementia, cerebral infarction, and stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2939939142,"Understanding why parenting programmes work or do not work, and for whom, is crucial for development of more effective parenting interventions. In this paper we focus on a specific component of Mellow Bumps: reflection on one’s own childhood/past/life. We explore how this component was implemented, how participants engaged with it, the facilitating and constraining factors shaping this, whether and how it appeared to work, or not, and for whom. The paper analyses data from the Process Evaluation of the Trial of Healthy Relationships Initiatives for the Very Early years, which is evaluating two antenatal interventions delivered to vulnerable women, one of which is Mellow Bumps. Data were collected from January 2014 to June 2018 for 28 groups, 108 participants and 24 facilitators in a comprehensive and rigorous Process Evaluation designed to complement the Outcome Evaluation. Data were gathered at various time points using multiple methods, and were synthesised to triangulate findings. The reflective component was implemented with fidelity and participants engaged with it to varying degrees, dependent largely on the coherence of the group. Patchy attendance compromised the coherence of some groups, with the development of rapport, which is key to delivering reflective exercises, more difficult when group composition varied from week to week. Where there was a coherent group, powerful mechanisms of change, leading to stress reduction, included: relief through unburdening, empowerment through support given and received, reduced isolation through sharing anxieties, and control through self-care advice. A minority of highly vulnerable mothers seemed not to benefit from the reflective exercises and were marginalised within their groups. In order to minimise potential harmful effects of such exercises, allocation of participants to groups should strive to maximise group homogeneity. More research is needed to explore how very vulnerable parents can be supported in attending parenting interventions from start to finish."
https://openalex.org/W2938913976,"The nutritional factors acting during early life can affect the development of the organism. It has been hypothesized that such programmed traits can be inherited by later generations. In this work, we present for the first time the effect of food deprivation in pregnant dams and its consequences for the transcription and DNA methylation profiles in the offspring of the next three generations. We used a 50% reduction in dietary intake during pregnancy in the rat and determined whether this altered the hepatic DNA methylation and transcription levels in female fetuses over three generations. Targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) was used in the first generation for 1748 genes associated with six selected biological processes. The selected cytosines were then studied by pyrosequencing in F1-F3. The transcript level of the selected genes was determined by the real-time PCR. The tNGS approach indicated 394 cytosines, in close proximity to 374 genes, with a statistically significant difference in methylation levels between the control and restricted groups. A gene clustering analysis revealed 23 molecular pathways to which the studied genes were assigned. Only seven cytosines were differently methylated to more than 10%, and so these sites were studied next using pyrosequencing. The observation from NGS was confirmed for only one cytosine located near the St6galnac5 gene, though this was with the opposite effect. A difference was also observed for the Usp30 gene, though in proximity to the cytosine selected from NGS. In F3, the differences were observed for the Oxct2b gene. We also found differences in methylation levels between generations for the Grb10 and St6galnac5 genes, but independently of the diet used. The transcript levels of selected genes (Usp30, Grb10, Pld1, St6galnac5, Oxct2b, Khk, and Acsl4) were not altered in F1, while changes were detected for Pld1 and Oxct2b in F2 and F3, respectively. Prenatal food deprivation did not induce broad changes in hepatic DNA methylation of the genes involved in lipid or carbohydrate metabolism, and did not result in alterations in their transcription. Thus, the hypothesis that transgenerational inheritance is induced by dietary restriction was not confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2940337558,"Background Calcium oxalate (CaOx) deposition in the kidney may lead to loss of native renal function but little is known about the prevalence and role of CaOx deposition in transplanted kidneys. Methods In patients transplanted in 2014 and 2015, all for-cause renal allograft biopsies obtained within 3 months post-transplantation were retrospectively investigated for CaOx deposition. Additionally, all preimplantation renal biopsies obtained in 2000 and 2001 were studied. Results In 2014 and 2015, 388 patients were transplanted, of whom 149 had at least one for-cause renal biopsy. Twenty-six (17%) patients had CaOx deposition. In the population with CaOx deposition: Patients had significantly more often been treated with dialysis before transplantation (89 vs. 64%; p = 0.011); delayed graft function occurred more frequently (42 vs. 23%; p = 0.038); and the eGFR at the time of first biopsy was significantly worse (21 vs. 29 ml/min/1.73m2; p = 0.037). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, eGFR at the time of first biopsy (OR 0.958, 95%-Cl: 0.924–0.993, p = 0.019), dialysis before transplantation (OR 4.868, 95%-Cl: 1.128–21.003, p = 0.034) and the time of first biopsy after transplantation (OR 1.037, 95%-Cl: 1.013–1.062, p = 0.002) were independently associated with CaOx deposition. Graft survival censored for death was significantly worse in patients with CaOx deposition (p = 0.018). In only 1 of 106 preimplantation biopsies CaOx deposition was found (0.94%). Conclusion CaOx deposition appears to be primarily recipient-derived and is frequently observed in for-cause renal allograft biopsies obtained within 3 months post-transplantation. It is associated with inferior renal function at the time of biopsy and worse graft survival."
https://openalex.org/W2938658547,"The impact of environmental change on internal migration has received wide attention in recent years. Mass internal migration has been a significant economic and social phenomenon in China, and soil erosion is a major environmental problem that impacts sustainable socioeconomic development. This study aims to identify the impact of soil erosion on internal migration in China at the county level based on gravity model by analyzing related data, such as the sixth national population census data and the soil and water conservation survey data. The results of spatial overlay could not identify an obvious relationship between soil erosion and net outmigration in China. The traditional gravity model of migration is modified to analyze the impact of soil erosion on net outmigration while other variables are controlled. The results indicate that only serious soil erosion increases the possibility of outmigration and that the impact is considerably higher in agricultural counties than in non-agricultural counties. In general, the impact of soil erosion on internal migration is far less than the impact of socioeconomic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2938294134,"The taxonomic identification of Lonchothrix emiliae (Rodentia, Echimyidae, Eumysopinae) is problematic because of the overlap of morphological characters with its sister clade represented by species in the genus Mesomys which, like L. emiliae, is distributed throughout the Amazonian biome. Cytogenetic studies reported the karyotype of L. emiliae as 2n = 60/FN = 116, but this karyotype and samples were later designated as M. hispidus. To evaluate the karyotype diversity of Lonchothrix and Mesomys, and to provide data useful as karyological diagnostic characters, in the present study we made a comparative analysis of specimens of L. emiliae and M. stimulax collected from two Brazilian Amazonian localities, using C-banding, G-banding, FISH using rDNA 45S and telomeric probes, and Cytochrome-b (Cytb) sequences. The results indicate that L. emiliae has 2n = 64♀, 65♂/FN = 124 and a multiple sexual system (XX/XY1Y2), while M. stimulax has 2n = 60/FN = 116. The Neo-X system found in L. emiliae also occurs in two Proechimys species, but cytogenetic analysis indicated an independent origin for these systems. The rDNA 45S analysis showed interstitial signals at one autosomal pair for each species, while an ITS found in L. emiliae was not coincident with the NOR. The molecular analysis confirmed Lonchothrix and Mesomys are sister genera, and the high level of intraspecific genetic divergence (7.1%) in M. stimulax suggests that it may be a species complex."

Ca2+ ions are known to play a key role in maintaining this junction. In this study, we hypothesized that Ca2+ chelation in stratum corneum will weaken the bond of the tissue and consequently promote exfoliation. Amino acids, ubiquitously existing as metabolites and building blocks of the body, have the molecular property to chelate Ca2+ ions. In the current study, we verified the Ca2+ chelating property of amino acids and demonstrated that amino acids can interfere with the interaction of cadherins, separate stratum corneum into pieces, and thereby stimulate the exfoliation process of skin. These results validate the importance of Ca2+ ion in the skin exfoliation process. Importantly, our findings indicate that amino acids may be efficiently used for improving skin conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2940055489,"A potentiometric whole cell biosensor based on immobilized marine bacterium, Pseudomonas carrageenovora producing κ-carrageenase and glycosulfatase enzymes for specific and direct determination of κ-carrageenan, is described. The bacterial cells were immobilized on the self-plasticized hydrogen ion (H+)-selective acrylic membrane electrode surface to form a catalytic layer. Hydrogen ionophore I was incorporated in the poly(n-butyl acrylate) [poly(nBA)] as a pH ionophore. Catalytic decomposition of κ-carrageenan by the bienzymatic cascade reaction produced neoagarobiose, an inorganic sulfate ion and a proton. The latter was detectable by H+ ion transducer for indirect potentiometric quantification of κ-carrageenan concentration. The use of a disposable screen-printed Ag/AgCl electrode (SPE) provided no cleaning requirement and enabled κ-carrageenan detection to be carried out conveniently without cross contamination in a complex food sample. The SPE-based microbial biosensor response was found to be reproducible with high reproducibility and relative standard deviation (RSD) at 2.6% (n = 3). The whole cell biosensor demonstrated a broad dynamic linear response range to κ-carrageenan from 0.2–100 ppm in 20 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.5 with a detection limit at 0.05 ppm and a Nernstian sensitivity of 58.78±0.87 mV/decade (R2 = 0.995). The biosensor showed excellent selectivity towards κ-carrageenan compared to other types of carrageenans tested e.g. ι-carrageenan and λ-carrageenan. No pretreatment to the food sample was necessary when the developed whole cell biosensor was employed for direct assay of κ-carrageenan in dairy product."
https://openalex.org/W2938306536,"The unrivaled computing capabilities of modern GPUs meet the demand of processing massive amounts of data seen in many application domains. While traditional HPC systems support applications as standalone entities that occupy entire GPUs, there are GPU-based DBMSs where multiple tasks are meant to be run at the same time in the same device. To that end, system-level resource management mechanisms are needed to fully unleash the computing power of GPUs in large data processing, and there were some researches focusing on it. In our previous work, we explored the single compute-bound kernel modeling on GPUs under NVidia's CUDA framework and provided an in-depth anatomy of the NVidia's concurrent kernel execution mechanism (CUDA stream). This paper focuses on resource allocation of multiple GPU applications towards optimization of system throughput in the context of systems. Comparing to earlier studies of enabling concurrent tasks support on GPU such as MultiQx-GPU, we use a different approach that is to control the launching parameters of multiple GPU kernels as provided by compile-time performance modeling as a kernel-level optimization and also a more general pre-processing model with batch-level control to enhance performance. Specifically, we construct a variation of multi-dimensional knapsack model to maximize concurrency in a multi-kernel environment. We present an in-depth analysis of our model and develop an algorithm based on dynamic programming technique to solve the model. We prove the algorithm can find optimal solutions (in terms of thread concurrency) to the problem and bears pseudopolynomial complexity on both time and space. Such results are verified by extensive experiments running on our microbenchmark that consists of real-world GPU queries. Furthermore, solutions identified by our method also significantly reduce the total running time of the workload, as compared to sequential and MultiQx-GPU executions."
https://openalex.org/W2939071794,"Damage in the bonding interface is a major factor that leads to the degradation of macroscopic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) structure because the damage generally results in the debonding or slipping between reinforcement and concrete. Based on hierarchical mesh methodology, a multi-scale finite element (FE) model consisting of coarse aggregate, mortar and steel rebar was established to analyze the failure process of RC structure in this paper. In order to develop the mesoscopic FE model, Monte-Carlo method was used to randomly generate the size and position of coarse aggregates; a criterion of mesh reconstruction was proposed to separate the macroscopic mesh into the mesoscopic mesh and the mesh of transitional zone; the damage constitutive relation model for concrete presenting significant difference of its tensional and compressive properties was adopted to control the damage evolution in concrete when loading; the birth-death element method was used to adaptively reform the multi-scale FE model, and finally macroscopic performance degradation of RC structure was evaluated reasonably. A example of standard RC specimen under unaxial load was performed to verify both the accuracy and efficiency of the developed FE model in analyzing failure mode of RC specimen under unaxial tension and compression. By using the developed multiscale FE model, the destruction process of a four-point bending RC beam was analyzed. The simulation results coincide well with the test results from another literature."

We analyse this goal-scoring behaviour in 1,008 recent soccer games played in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League and Europa League. In contrast to Gary Lineker's well-known quote that ""at the end, the Germans always win"", no significant evidence is found for German teams scoring a goal in the dying seconds more often than other teams. Our results indicate, however, that European clubs do have an interest in learning from the end-of-game tactics used by French and Spanish clubs in recent international games as these teams were less likely to concede a goal during the dying seconds. English teams were also in this situation but only if they had an English coach."
