https://openalex.org/W1979881492,"The House Science Committee has passed a bill to authorize programs in 1997 for most civilian, nonmedical federal research. The bill would spend $1.2 billion less than what President Clinton has requested and $600 million below what those agencies can spend this year, although it would boost basic research spending by about $250 million over current levels. The agreement, which could be voted on by the entire House as early as next week, was the product of a rancorous, 9-hour debate that demonstrates a widening rift between Republicans and Democrats on many science and technology issues."
