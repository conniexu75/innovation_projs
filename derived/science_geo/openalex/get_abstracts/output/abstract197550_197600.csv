In order to avoid further confusion we propose to call the basic, unsubstituted compound neuraminic acid. Sialic acid is suggested as group name for the acylated neuraminic acids (for example, N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid, diacetylneuraminic acids). For the enzyme which splits the glycosidic linkage joining the terminal sialic acid to the residual oligo- or polysaccharide the names neuraminidase and sialidase may be used synonymously. We have agreed to use this nomenclature in future."

https://openalex.org/W2055711212,"A HYPOTHESIS of tumour formation based on the catalase–hydrogen peroxide mechanism in living cells was published recently1 following observations on abnormalities occurring in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria due to certain respiratory irregularities2. If this hypothesis be correct, then a logical assumption is that agents which inactivate catalase or produce hydrogen peroxide (or free radicals) should have a detrimental effect on tumours."

https://openalex.org/W2084990401,"THE existence of glutaminase in bacteria has been demonstrated1–3. However, to our knowledge no work has been done on other micro-organisms such as Protozoa. Little is known on the enzymatic make-up of Endamoeba histolytica 4. Recently, proteolytic enzymes were demonstrated in the amoebae5. Since a method became available for obtaining large quantities of bacteria-free amoebae6,7an investigation was undertaken to study the glut-amine hydrolysing enzyme in this organism."
https://openalex.org/W2071318795,"IN connexion with a programme of studies of the relationships between biochemical and ethnological differentiations (some aspects of which have already been discussed1) proceeding in this Department, we wished to explore the possibility of improving existing procedures for the estimation of amino-acids separated on paper chromatograms2, before beginning an investigation of the patterns of urinary excretion of amino-acids by normal members of various ethnic groups living in Malaya."

Detailed immunobiological and immunochemical studies of this kind have been carried out only upon lecithinases from Clostridia 1–3."

https://openalex.org/W2079118915,"IN 1946 two crystalline acidic antibiotics (‘nudic acids A and B’) were isolated from the culture medium of the basidiomycete Tricholoma nudum (Bull.) Fr. and some preliminary work on their respective constitutions was carried out1. It has now been shown that ‘nudic acid B’ is identical with ‘diatretyne II’ (7-cyano-trans-hept-2-en-4 : 6-diynoic acid (I)), which is produced by another fungus, Clitocybe diatreta
2, and which has been obtained synthetically (Ashworth, Jones, Mansfield, Schlogl, Thompson and Whiting, unpublished work)."

A series of rabbits was given a dose of 1,000 r. or 1,500 r. (100 kV., 7 m.amp., 2 mm. aluminium filter; half-value layer, 0.11 mm. copper; focus–skin distance, 15.5 cm.) through a ‘new moon and sixpence’ pattern in a lead shield backed with ‘Perspex’ (a circular area of 3 cm. diameter separated by a strip of skin 1 cm. in width, from a crescent-shaped exposed area of skin also 1 cm. in width surrounding half its circumference), and a solution containing 0.4 mc. of radioactive phosphorus was injected within the circle immediately after exposure."

https://openalex.org/W2008460664,"EXPERIMENTS on shape discrimination in rats, using the Lashley two-card jumping stand, have shown that, when rats are pre-trained to discriminate horizontal from vertical striations (horizontal positive), they tend to choose other shapes with a horizontal base-line, such as a square, triangle or pentagon, in preference to a second shape which lacks the horizontal base, such as a circle or inverted triangle. This suggests that a horizontal line in one shape of a pair which have to be discriminated from one another is isolated by the animal as a basis for discrimination; this has been verified for a number of ‘transfer’ shapes, and in each case the horizontal base was the effective element in discrimination. These experiments, reported in detail elsewhere1, were designed to overcome objections to earlier work in this field, for example, the classic studies of Lashley2."

https://openalex.org/W2028858245,"FOR quantitative studies of hæmopoiesis1, it is important to know both the absolute count of cells per unit volume of bone marrow and also the volume of the marrow as a whole. From a review of the literature it appears that whereas in man and in a few laboratory animals a small number of determinations of marrow volume have been made, none has been made in the guinea pig. Since this latter animal is the one on which in our own laboratory a number of quantitative studies of hæmopoiesis are in progress, it has become necessary to determine its marrow volume with as much accuracy as possible. The following is a summary of my observations."

https://openalex.org/W4252160497,"IT was observed, while watching a television screen from about 6 ft., that, if the eyes were moved rapidly across the screen from a point about one foot to the left of the screen to a point a similar distance to the right, a clear picture could often be seen to the right of the screen. It was in the shape of a parallelogram with base and height the same as the screen, sloping to the right. It appeared almost as bright as the screen, and the picture on it could often be seen in considerable detail. If the eye movement was in the opposite direction, the same effect was obtained, with the parallelogram sloping to the left. By moving the eyes through a wider arc, more than one such image could be seen."
