https://openalex.org/W2053717798,"An adenyl cyclase activated by low concentrations of dopamine has been found in the mammalian superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. The existence of this enzyme may account for the increased amount of adenosine 3',5' monophosphate associated with synaptic activity in the ganglion. The results suggest that the physiological effects of dopamine in the ganglion, and possibly elsewhere in the nervous system, may be mediated by stimulating the synthesis of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate."

The data indicate that angiotensin II is in fact critically involved in the pathogenesis of the form of renal hypertension in which one renal artery is clamped and the contralateral kidney is left in place, but that it probably plays no significant role in the maintenance of experimental renal hypertension in which the opposite kidney has been removed."

https://openalex.org/W1492637089,"Abstract The ability of proteins in various subcellular fractions of the rat cerebrum to act as substrates for a partially purified cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase has been studied in vitro. Distribution of substrates generally paralleled the distribution of activity of protein kinase as well as of adenylate cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Although all particulate subfractions were capable of becoming phosphorylated, highest substrate activities were found in the synaptic plasma membrane, microsomal, and synaptic vesicle fractions. Substrates in the microsomal fraction included both membrane and ribosomal proteins. The synaptic plasma membrane and the microsomal fractions exhibited a high endogenous rate of incorporation of radioactive phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP into phosphoprotein, compared to other subcellular fractions, and this rate was increased by addition of protein kinase and cyclic AMP. Phosphorylation of the synaptic plasma membrane fractions indicated that some membrane proteins were at least comparable to and possibly better than the histones in effectiveness as substrate for the enzyme. The results support other evidence implicating the cyclic AMP system in the molecular events underlying synaptic transmission in the nervous system."

These actions of bicuculline suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acid may be the transmitter involved in spinal presynaptic inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1515836409,"Abstract The distribution of protein kinases activated specifically by low concentrations of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) or adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in various tissues and species of Arthropoda was studied. The Arthropoda were found to represent a rich source of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases. The relative levels of cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases varied widely among different tissues of a species and among similar tissues of different species. The proportions found ranged from apparently all cyclic GMP-dependent enzyme (in silkmoth fat body) to apparently all cyclic AMP-dependent enzyme (in lobster gill), other tissues exhibiting various intermediate ratios. Evidence was obtained of dissimilarities between these two classes of protein kinase and between the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases of arthropod and of mammalian origin, including specificity for protein substrates and pattern of activation by divalent cations. Interestingly, the cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases of arthropods and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases of vertebrates tended to resemble one another in these respects. Within each class of enzyme, preparations from different tissues also varied significantly in their characteristics. The variable ratios of cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in tissues, coupled with their different characteristics, suggest that cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP are specific and distinct from one another in terms of their biochemical and physiological actions."

https://openalex.org/W1559570687,"Abstract Extracts of wild type Escherichia coli contain a DNase which catalyzes the release of acid-soluble fragments from native DNA; this activity cannot be detected in rec B and C mutants. The properties of this enzyme have been studied with a fraction purified 200- to 600-fold. Only in the presence of ATP does the purified enzyme act on native DNA; with denatured DNA this ATP requirement is not absolute. The purified fraction requires Mg++ and is active over a broad pH range with an optimum of about 9.2. The exonuclease action of the purified enzyme fraction is due to two exonuclease activities. (a) An exonuclease, which we have called exonuclease V, acts on double-stranded DNA only in the presence of an activating nucleoside triphosphate, ATP and dATP being the most efficient. During DNA degradation, ATP is cleaved to ADP and Pi. The products formed during the degradation of native DNA are composed of 3'-hydroxyl- and 5'-phosphate-ended oligonucleotides, the average size of which decreases as the reaction proceeds. Exonuclease V attacks DNA from ends generated by double-stranded breakage and does not attack circular double-stranded DNA molecules with or without single-stranded breaks. Also associated with exonuclease V is an ATP-dependent cleavage of single-stranded DNA. (b) A 3'-exonuclease, acts on single-stranded DNA in the absence of ATP, and whose properties are distinguishable from those of exonuclease I, is responsible for the other exonuclease activity. The possible role of exonuclease V in DNA recombination is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1482090517,"Abstract The rat liver perfusion previously employed was adapted to a flow-through system in which samples of effluent perfusion medium were collected for measurement of metabolic products at 2-min intervals by means of a fraction collector. Overnight fasted rats were used to avoid complications of glucose formation from endogenous glycogen. Since xylitol conversion to glucose and lactate by the liver is associated with the production of NADH in the cytosol, the rates of production of these metabolic end products can be used to provide a measure of the rate of NADH production and utilization. Xylitol metabolism was predominantly cyanide sensitive showing an obligatory involvement of mitochondrial respiration for removal of reducing equivalents from the cytosol. The participation of various shuttles for the transport of reducing equivalents into the mitochondria was investigated by infusion of the oxidized or reduced partners of cytosolic or mitochondrial NAD-linked dehydrogenases (e.g. ethanol, β-hydroxybutyrate), or specific inhibitors such as rotenone, amobarbital, cyanide, and the transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate. The influence of flux in the mitochondrial electron transport chain on the rate of removal of NADH from the cytosol was studied by infusion of 2,4-dinitrophenol to produce an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, ornithine plus ammonia to provide an energy drain on mitochondrial ATP, and artificial electron acceptors to bypass rate-limiting electron transport steps. The studies show that xylitol metabolism was not controlled by the activity of NAD-xylitol dehydrogenase but by the rate of reoxidation of NADH. This process was regulated by the rate of transfer of reducing equivalents into the mitochondria and by the rate of electron flux to oxygen. Evidence was obtained for the participation of both NAD- and flavin-linked shuttles in the over-all transport of reducing equivalents from cytosol to mitochondria. The flavin-linked shuttle may be identified with the α-glycerophosphate shuttle which operates by virtue of the abnormally high cytosolic α-glycerophosphate concentration produced during xylitol metabolism. Involvement of the NAD-linked malate-aspartate shuttle was shown by the sensitivity of glucose formation from xylitol to aminooxyacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate. The relevance of these findings to the control of ethanol utilization by the liver is discussed."

Eighteen out of 25 specimens contained RNA possessing homology to the RNA of the mouse leukemia virus but not to that of the unrelated viruses causing mammary tumors in mice or myeloblastosis in chickens. Further, no normal adult or fetal tissues showed significant amounts of RNA specific to mouse leukemia virus. It appears that human sarcomas contain RNA sequences homologous to those found in an agent related to a virus known to cause sarcomas in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2019262588,"Two types of gill contraction in Aplysia were used to study the relation of peripheral and central pathways in controlling behavioral responses in a mollusk. A weak or moderate tactile stimulus to the mantle elicits gill contraction (gill-withdrawal reflex) as a component of a more extensive withdrawal response; a stimulus applied directly to the gill elicits a localized response of the gill pinnule (pinnule response). Central pathways through the abdominal ganglion are both necessary and sufficient for the gill-withdrawal reflex, and motor neuron L7 makes direct connections with gill muscles, without engaging the peripheral plexus. Peripheral pathways are necessary and sufficient for the pinnule response. As a result of the independence of peripheral and central pathways, habituation by repeated tactile stimulation of one pathway does not affect the responsiveness of the other pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2345902112,"Abstract Mammary epithelial cell differentiation, as effected by the interplay of insulin, corticosteroid(s), and prolactin, has been further studied in vitro. Emphasis has been placed on the synthesis of casein in relation to the fabrication and function of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Minimal hormone requirements for the accumulation of the RER are insulin and corticosteroid. This is based on determinations of membrane-linked NADH-cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.6.99.3) and of RNA content of isolated RER. Accumulation of the enzyme is affected very little by insulin, modestly increased by hydrocortisone, and greatly enhanced by the combination of the two hormones. RNA content of RER is virtually unaltered by hydrocortisone, but is increased by insulin. This effect of insulin is, however, enhanced by the presence of hydrocortisone. Addition of hydrocortisone to an insulin-containing postmitotic system causes redistribution of free ribosomes to the membrane-bound variety without a net increase in ribosomes. In the absence of the steroid, insulin promotes development of an unstable RER which also is deficient in NADH-cytochrome c reductase. Prolactin does not affect the membrane-linked enzyme. It does, however, stimulate the rate of RNA synthesis and increases the RNA content of the membrane system. In the absence of RER, prolactin also increases the rate of RNA synthesis, but this effect is not sustained. Three lines of evidence strongly suggest that casein formation by these epithelial cells is dependent upon the presence of the RER that is induced by insulin and hydrocortisone. (a) There is close agreement between casein synthesis and RER formation as a function of hydrocortisone concentration. (b) RER formation precedes casein synthesis. (c) Casein formation requires sustained stimulation of RNA synthesis by prolactin, which, in turn, is dependent on the presence of RER."
https://openalex.org/W1583519957,"Abstract Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli B was purified 1000-fold by MnCl2 precipitation and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and Amberlite CG-50. The purified enzyme gave one peak of constant specific activity on Sephadex G-200, one protein band on disc gel electrophoresis, and contained no other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The rate of tryptophanyl-tRNA formation was optimal at pH 8.8. The kinetic constants for tryptophan, ATP, and tRNAtrp were determined at pH 7.0 and 8.8, and the turnover number was 1200 at pH 8.8. The amino acid composition is similar to the composition of other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, except for a low tryptophan and half-cystine content. tRNAtrp was purified on benzoylated DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite columns. The final product had a specific activity of 1.8 nmoles per A260 unit and an estimated purity of 100%. The calculated ratio of tRNAtrp to tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase in vivo is 1:1."
https://openalex.org/W1481154344,"Abstract The properties of the enzyme UDP-glucose 4-epimerase from Escherichia coli have been investigated. Its substrate specificity is comparatively low, it acts on the thymidine, cytidine, and adenine, as well as the uridine diphospho derivatives of glucose. Its specificity toward modifications of carbon 6 of the hexose moiety of the substrate is also low. The formation of NADH on the enzyme in the presence of substrate (Wilson, D. B., and Hogness, D. S., J. Biol. Chem., 239, 2469 (1964)) is less specific for the substrate than is the over-all epimerization. UDP-mannose causes reduction of the enzyme-bound NAD+ but is not epimerized. It has been shown that the epimerization is an oxidation-reduction process involving NAD+ as the oxidant and UDP-4-ketoglucose as the enzyme-bound oxidized intermediate. Transfer of the 4-hydrogen from the hexose moiety of UDP-6-deoxyglucose to the B-position of NADH and its transfer back to several nucleotide-4-keto sugars has been demonstrated. The nucleotide-4-keto sugars were synthesized using enzymatic or chemical reactions or both. The enzyme-bound NAD+ is subject to reduction by NaBH4 and the hydrogen is specifically transferred to the B-side of the nicotinamide ring. When conducted in the presence of substrate, this chemical reduction of NAD+ is accompanied by the binding of 1 mole of the substrate and complete loss of enzyme activity. Another method of reducing the enzyme-bound NAD+ is to incubate the enzyme with substrate for long periods of time. In addition to the steady state level, there is a slow increase in enzyme-NADH which is accompanied by loss of enzyme activity, strong binding of 1 mole of substrate and incorporation of the 4-hydrogen of the substrate into the B-position of NADH. Both forms of the reduced enzyme can be oxidized and reactivated by nucleotide-4-keto sugars with removal of the B-hydrogen from NADH. The possibility that tryptophan functions as an intermediate hydrogen carrier in this reaction, as it has been proposed to do in several other NAD+-linked dehydrogenase reactions (Schellenberg, K. A., J. Biol. Chem., 242, 1815 (1967)), has been investigated. It would appear that there are no intermediate hydrogen carriers involved."
https://openalex.org/W1488199588,"Abstract Pure secretory granules are isolated in high yield from bovine anterior pituitary gland by a method which uses differential and isopycnic centrifugation. The secretory granules are phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP by an endogenous protein kinase. At least 77% of the radioactivity is incorporated into protein components of the secretory granules. A negligible amount of 32P is associated with phospholipids (2%). [32P]Phosphate is incorporated into phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Only 18% of the incorporated 32P can be removed by washing the granules in a high salt solution (0.50 m KCl). ATP-ase activity is associated with the secretory granules. Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate does not stimulate the protein kinase activity under endogenous conditions of substrate availability but leads to a 40 to 80% stimulation of enzymatic activity in the presence of histones. The enzyme associated with the secretory granules is Mg2+-dependent and its activity is inhibited by Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1485519622,"An oligonucleotide primer is necessary to initiate polymerization of nucleotides by the DNA polymerase of avian myeloblastosis virus. The role of the primer was investigated by synthesizing the acid-soluble oligonucleotide [5′-32P](dT)10. Conversion of this primer to an acid-insoluble form by the DNA polymerase in the presence of poly(A) indicated that the primer was physically incorporated into the product. The phosphate residue at the 5′-terminus of the primer remained sensitive to alkaline phosphatase, and synthesis therefore appeared to proceed by addition of mononucleotides at the 3′-OH of the primer. Inhibition of DNA polymerase activity by dideoxythymidine triphosphate was observed using templates containing AMP or when the enzyme was copying the viral RNA found in the virion. Copying of poly(C) by the DNA polymerase was not sensitive to the analogue. These results corroborate the conclusion that the polymerase adds nucleotides to the 3′-OH of a primer and further indicate that copying of the endogenous viral RNA involves only polymerization on 3′-OH groups."
https://openalex.org/W1601852963,"Abstract Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase was purified from bovine anterior pituitary gland by pH and ammonium sulfate precipitations and chromatography on sulfoethyl-Sephadex. Maximal rates of histone phosphorylation were observed in the presence and absence of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) at pH 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. The apparent Km value for histone was 125 µg per ml in the presence and absence of cyclic AMP. The apparent Km values for ATP in the presence and absence of cyclic AMP were 1.7 and 1.3 x 10-5 m, respectively. Half-maximal stimulation by the cyclic nucleotide was observed at 2.5 x 10-8 m. Maximal activation of protein kinase activity was obtained at much higher concentrations of the other cyclic nucleotides. No significant phosphorylation of histones occurred when γ-labeled UTP, CTP, or GTP was used instead of ATP. The enzyme requires both Mg2+ and ATP-Mg2- for activity. Magnesium decreases the apparent Km of the enzyme for ATP and increases the Vmax of enzymatic activity. The two peaks of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity observed on sucrose gradients are converted to a single light peak in the presence of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1556831701,"Abstract Clostripain is rapidly and selectively inactivated by the chloromethyl ketone derived from α-N-tosyl-l-lysine (TLCK) with an apparent second order rate constant of 8.7 x 104 m-1 sec-1 at pH 6.5. Alkylation by TLCK occurs only with catalytically active enzyme, the rate of which is considerably retarded by the competitive inhibitors, α-N-tosyl-l-homoarginine methyl ester and benzamidine. In contrast, the chloromethyl ketone derived from α-N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine (TPCK) does not inhibit clostripain at molar concentrations 100 times greater than the effective concentration of TLCK. A very large molar excess of TPCK does inhibit the enzyme with an apparent rate constant of 46.7 m-1 sec-1 at pH 6.5. Other irreversible inhibitors of clostripain such as dibromoacetone and iodoacetate require molar concentrations 300 and 3000 times greater, respectively, than TLCK for equivalent inactivation. Such results are in accord with the substrate specificity of the enzyme and support an active site-directed mechanism for inhibition by TLCK. The rapidity of alkylation of the active site of clostripain by TLCK is consistent with the large kcat (643 sec-1) observed for substrate hydrolysis (benzoylarginine ethyl ester) and the tentative identification of an essential —SH group in the catalytic mechanism. These results extend the use of TLCK in labeling the active site of a protease with high arginine specificity and offer a method for the specific irreversible inactivation of clostripain which occurs as the major proteolytic contaminant in both crude and highly purified collagenase preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1531776916,"Abstract Reduced sulfmyoglobin has been shown to be in the ferrous state by optical titration with ferricyanide. The product of this reaction, ferric sulfmyoglobin, has been well characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance. The kinetics of autoxidation of ferrous sulfmyoglobin is reported. In the ferrous state, sulfmyoglobin has been shown to bind oxygen reversibly. It exhibits a rectangular hyperbolic binding curve (Hill coefficient n = 1.0) like that of myoglobin, but with a p½ at 5° and pH 8 of 0.7 atm or 530 mm Hg, corresponding to an oxygen affinity 2500-fold lower than that of myoglobin at the same temperature. This accounts for the apparent inability of sulfmyoglobin to bind O2 under physiological conditions. The low oxygen affinity is discussed in terms of structural features of the molecule which lower the electron density at the iron and is an example of electronic control of oxygen affinity in hemoglobin-like compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1531008735,"Abstract Xylitol metabolism and its interaction with lactate metabolism has been investigated in perfused livers from fasted rats. Xylitol (5 mm) served as a strong reductant for cytosolic NAD systems as shown by increased ratios of lactate to pyruvate, α-glycerophosphate to dihydroxyacetone-P, and triose phosphates to 3-P-glycerate. The mitochondrial NAD system, as monitored by changes of the β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratio, was less affected, particularly when xylitol was added in the presence of lactate, suggesting a limitation in the rate of transport of NADH from cytosol to mitochondria. Xylitol also caused an increased reduction of bound NAD as determined analytically and by increased pyridine nucleotide fluorescence measured by surface fluorometry. The latter technique showed that half-maximum reduction was obtained with 0.4 mm xylitol, suggesting that xylitol was metabolized principally to d-xylulose via the low Km cytosolic NAD-linked xylitol dehydrogenase. In the perfused liver xylitol was converted mainly to glucose, after phosphorylation of d-xylulose to d-xylulose-5-P and metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway. Lactate uptake and conversion to glucose were strongly inhibited by xylitol. This effect was interpreted as resulting from the increased cytosolic NADH:NAD ratio which caused pyruvate levels to fall. An observed decrease of acetyl coenzyme A levels may also contribute to diminished flux through pyruvate carboxylase. Xylitol uptake was less affected by the presence of lactate, presumably because of the lower midpotential of NAD-xylitol dehydrogenase (-236 mvolts) compared with that of lactate dehydrogenase (-216 mvolts). Ketone body production from endogenous fatty acids was inhibited equally by lactate and xylitol. The production of ketone bodies from added oleic acid was marginally inhibited by xylitol, suggesting the absence of a specific antiketogenic effect in the isolated liver. Xylitol metabolism was not associated with any increased rate of respiration, showing that reoxidation of NADH produced by xylitol dehydrogenase caused an inhibition of the citric acid cycle. Total adenine nucleotide levels diminished slightly during xylitol metabolism, but the ATP:ADP ratio was not appreciably changed."
https://openalex.org/W1510725443,"Abstract Fifty per cent of the total protein kinase activity from bovine anterior pituitary gland is found in the 200,000 x g supernatant. The remaining enzymatic activity is widely distributed among the subcellular particulate fractions. The microsomal fraction has the highest specific activity under conditions of endogenous substrate availability whereas the 200,000 x g supernatant is the most active in the presence of excess histones. A large proportion of the enzymatic activity (43 to 86%) is solubilized by Triton X-100 from the various subcellular particulate fractions. Unmasking of protein kinase activity by the detergent is especially high in the smooth microsomal fraction. The relatively low cyclic AMP dependence of the protein kinase associated with the particulate fractions and the high proportion (80%) of enzyme available to exogenous substrate in the 200,000 x g supernatant suggests that the primary effect of cyclic AMP might be exerted on the receptor-catalytic protein kinase complex in the cytosol with subsequent binding of the catalytic subunit to its various soluble or particulate substrates in the adenohypophyseal cell."
https://openalex.org/W1557698969,"Abstract Uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.9) from Dictyostelium discoideum has been purified to apparent physical and immunochemical homogeneity. The molecular weight estimates from gel diffusion and equilibrium sedimentation analyses are 390,000 and 384,000, respectively. The enzyme is polymeric apparently composed of a single monomeric species with a molecular weight of 55,000 as shown by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specific activity is 48,000 units per mg. The turnover numbers are 16,500 moles of UDP-glucose and 18,700 moles of glucose-1-P per min per mole of enzyme. The following Km values were obtained: glucose-1-P, 2.6 x 10-4 m; UTP, 1.1 x 10-4 m; UDP-glucose, 1.7 x 10-4 m; pyrophosphate, 4.4 x 10-4 m. UTP inhibits pyrophosphorylase activity both as a substrate at excess concentration and as a product, the latter inhibition being competitive with UDP-glucose. Pyrophosphate is a potent product inhibitor, not competitive with either glucose-1-P or UTP. Mixtures of the purified enzyme with crude extracts of cells harvested at different stages of fruiting body construction demonstrated that the assay of enzyme activity employed is an accurate reflection of the concentration of enzyme in the extracts. A high titer antiserum has been obtained which yields a single band in double diffusion assays with either purified enzyme preparations or crude extracts. Quantitative complement fixation and immune precipitation assays revealed no serological differences between the basal enzyme found in the vegetative cells and that which accumulates during fruiting body construction and demonstrated that the 10-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme which occurs during specific stages of fruit construction is correlated with a proportionate increase in a single antigenic component. The enzyme was also immune precipitated from crude extracts of cells labeled with [35S]methionine during the period of enzyme accumulation. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme antibody complex solubilized with dodecyl sulfate showed a single labeled peak at the position of the enzyme monomer. Thus at least part if not all of the enzyme that accumulates during fruiting body construction is composed of newly synthesized monomers."

In contrast, HgCl(2) inhibits binding both in extracts and cells. Since both organic mercury compounds, unlike HgCl(2), do not readily enter intact cells, it appears that the specific steroid binding occurs inside the cell rather than at the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1552792204,"Abstract A method is described for the purification of cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) from a particulate fraction of Red Star yeast. The enzyme as isolated contains up to 7.2 nmoles of heme a per mg of protein and is free from contamination by hemes other than heme a. The spectrum of the reduced enzyme equilibrated with carbon monoxide is apparently dependent on the aggregation state of the enzyme. The fact that the enzyme is capable of assuming both a monomeric and a dimeric state of aggregation is demonstrated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and susceptibility to dithionite reduction. After dissociation at 100° in sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-mercaptoethanol, the enzyme shows four major polypeptide components when subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and 6 m urea."
https://openalex.org/W1566641857,"Abstract Glucagon and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) have been shown to prevent the induction of rat liver glucose-6-P dehydrogenase which normally occurs when fasted rats are fed a high carbohydrate, non-fat diet. This is a specific effect which can occur without any change in the amount of diet consumed. It is concluded that increases in the level of cyclic AMP may repress the synthesis of lipogenic enzymes as well as induce the synthesis of several gluconeogenic enzymes. Thus, the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism mediated by cyclic AMP may be exerted at the level of enzyme synthesis as well as by more rapid processes involving the activation and inactivation of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1586590993,"Abstract The pH dependencies of the spin state equilibria of ferric hemoglobin, of isolated α and β subunits, and of a semi-hemoglobin were investigated by measurements of paramagnetic susceptibilities at 293° K and 77° K, visible absorption spectra at 293° K and 77° K, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (EPR) at 77° K and 4.2° K. Similar results were obtained by all three methods. Acid ferric forms of hemoglobin, α chains, and semi-hemoglobin, which were in the high spin state at 293° K, were reversibly converted to a mixture of high spin and low spin compounds upon cooling to 77° K. Acid ferric β chains were a mixture of high spin and low spin compounds at 293° K and in an essentially low spin state at 77° K. The low spin compound formed in these preparations was not detected by EPR at 77° K but showed EPR signals at g1 = 2.75, g2 = 2.25, and g3 = 1.69 at 4.2° K. On the basis of its optical and EPR characteristics, the low spin compound was assigned a structure in which the 6th coordination position of the heme iron is occupied by a nitrogenous group, probably by the distal histidyl residue. It was proposed that the conformational constraint exerted by the loss of the α-β subunit contacts in the β chains and the steric hindrance caused by frozen media might be responsible for the proposed bonding of the distal group directly to the heme iron."

https://openalex.org/W1481420288,"Abstract The effect of reversible inactivation on the physical and chemical properties of dogfish M4 and chicken heart H4 lactate dehydrogenases has been studied. Reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide was found to have a significant effect on the rate of recovery of the enzymatic activity, but not on the over-all recovery. Optical rotatory dispersion, circular dichroism, fluorescence, and immunological studies have shown structural differences between the native and reassociated enzyme. Further evidence for the difference in conformational structure was obtained from the pattern of reactivity of sulfhydryl groups of the reactivated enzyme. The native enzyme was also found to be more stable to heat and urea denaturation than the reassociated form. Pyruvate inhibition, and the catalytic activity with coenzyme analogues, was found to be different for the native and the reassociated enzyme. These results indicate the possibility that a conformational difference exists between the native and the reassociated enzyme for both dogfish M4 and chicken H4 lactate dehydrogenase. Studies on the lactate dehydrogenase reassociated in the presence of reduced DPN showed structural characteristics which are closer to the native dehydrogenase than the enzyme which was reassociated in the absence of the reduced coenzyme. Incubation of the enzyme with DPNH after reassociation does not convert the reassociated enzyme to a structure similar to that of the native enzyme. These studies suggest a possible role of the reduced coenzyme in the folding of the peptide chain or in the subunit interaction and in the attainment of the native conformation of the enzyme."

High specific activity cyclic [3H]AMP is used to determine purification recovery for each sample. The method has also been used to determine cyclic AMP and cyclic [14C]AMP specific activity in perfused frog ventricles prelabeled with [14C]adenosine.

For example, nuclease-T-(6–48) (residues 6 to 48) binds to nuclease-T-(49–149) and to nuclease-T-(50–149) and forms nuclease-T', the enzymically active and ordered complexes ((6–48) + (49–149)) and ((6–48) + (50–149)), respectively. Nuclease-(1–126) and nuclease-(99–149) yield another functional complex ((1–126) + (99–149)). In the present study, nuclease-(49, 50–126) (the mixture of residues 49 to 126 and 50 to 126) was prepared by limited trypsin digestion of trifluoroacetylated nuclease-T-(49, 50–149) (the mixture of nuclease-T-(49–149) and nuclease-T-(50–149)). It is shown that nuclease-T-(6–48), nuclease-(49, 50–126), and nuclease-(99–149) bind in equimolar ratio below 20° to form a population of three-fragment complexes, presumably the mixture of ((6–48) + (49–126) + (99–149)) and ((6–48) + (50–126) + (99–149)). The three-fragment complex appears to have intrinsic enzymic activity, although at very low level, and affinity for the nuclease ligand, deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate in the presence of Ca2+. The heat stability of the three-fragment complex is less than that of the enzymically active derivatives with only one discontinuity of the polypeptide chain, although the latter themselves show lower heat stability than that of intact nuclease. These observations support the view that specific non-covalent binding of the three fragments to form an enzymically active structure can still take place if the simultaneous cleavages of the peptide bonds are at the two permissible sites."
https://openalex.org/W1602896852,"Abstract Proteinpolysaccharides from bovine embryonic rudiments and calf nasal septa were compared by conventional ultracentrifugation in isotonic salt solutions, equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, and free flow electrophoresis. These methods are all suitable for use with large amounts of material and give reliable materials balances. Fractions obtained by any one method could be isolated and then refractionated by the other methods. The main distinction between fractions was in their composition. All fractions of the rudiment proteinpolysaccharide contained more protein than the corresponding nasal septum fractions. In gradient centrifugation, where the distribution of the proteinpolysaccharide was most influenced by protein content, much more of the rudiment proteinpolysaccharide than of the nasal septum proteinpolysaccharide was found in the less dense section of the gradient. Moreover, during conventional ultracentrifugation in isotonic salt solution, much more of the rudiment proteinpolysaccharide separated from the solution as a gel phase. All proteinpolysaccharide fractions obtained by the methods used in this study, regardless of composition, migrate to a characteristic peak area on electrophoresis. The protein-rich fractions of proteinpolysaccharide could be localized in the upper part of the gradient on centrifugation, in the separated, gel phase on conventional ultracentrifugation, and in the more slowly migrating section of the characteristic peak area on electrophoresis. Collagen is found in all high protein fractions and even, to a lesser extent, in the dense fraction of the rudiment proteinpolysaccharide. However, the collagen is not responsible for the distribution pattern of the proteinpolysaccharides on fractionation since that distribution is not altered by the removal of collagen with collagenase. The major component of protein-rich fractions from either tissue was shown to be proteinpolysaccharide by both analytical and electrophoretic criteria. The remixing experiments, which have attributed a specific linking function to a glycoprotein for the aggregation of proteinpolysaccharide, implicitly depend on the absence of proteinpolysaccharide in the low density fractions. Hence, the isolation of proteinpolysaccharide from these fractions questions the validity of such experiments as an unequivocal demonstration of a definitive role for the glycoprotein as a linking agent."
https://openalex.org/W1535631383,"Abstract A study has been made of the specificity of arginine kinase for both the nucleotide and guanidino substrates. The results have indicated that the magnesium complexes of dADP, UDP, GDP, and CDP, as well as MgADP-, can function as acceptors of the phosphoryl group of phosphoarginine. The initial velocity data obtained with each of the magnesium-nucleoside diphosphate complexes have been analyzed on the basis that the reaction mechanism is rapid equilibrium random, irrespective of the structure of the nucleotide and values obtained for the various kinetic parameters. The values indicate that while the maximum velocities of the reactions differ markedly according to the identity of the nucleotide, all these substrates combine more readily with free enzyme than with the enzyme-phosphoarginine complex. MgCDP-, MgGDP-, and MgUDP- have also been used as inhibitors of the reaction in the presence of MgADP-. The resulting inhibition patterns and values determined for the inhibition constants lend support to the assumption that all reactions have a rapid equilibrium, random mechanism. AMP and magnesium-inorganic pyrophosphate were found to act as inhibitors. It appears that the enzyme has an absolute specificity for l-arginine since no reaction was obtained with d-arginine, canavanine, or creatine. However, both creatine and phosphocreatine can react with arginine kinase as judged by the fact that both these guanidino compounds are capable of inhibiting the reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1504180696,"Abstract Extracts of nicotinate-grown Clostridum barkeri ferment [7-14C]nicotinate to 14CO2 and a mixture of volatile and non-volatile acidic products. This conversion is markedly stimulated by the addition of certain intermediates of the over-all fermentation pathway, namely pyruvate, α-methyleneglutarate, methylitaconate, or dimethylmaleate. In large scale experiments [14C]α-methyleneglutarate, [14C]methylitaconate, and [14C]dimethylmaleate were detected among the products of [7-14C]nicotinate metabolism. When specifically labeled α-methyleneglutarate and dimethylmaleate were fermented, the distribution of 14C among the final products (acetate, propionate, and carbon dioxide) was as predicted from the earlier tracer experiments. The carboxyl carbon of pyruvate is the most likely precursor of carbon dioxide in the fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W1528442870,"Abstract Effects of the substrate on the initial reaction velocity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked l-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase purified from rabbit liver were studied. The true Michaelis constants for all substrates were determined in 0.1 m tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and were found to be 0.68, 0.19, 0.018, and 0.004 mm for l-glycerol 3-phosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, respectively. The true Michaelis constants measured in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10.0) were found to be 0.065 and 0.03 mm for l-glycerol 3-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, respectively. High concentration of all four substrates in the reaction mixture was found to be to some extent inhibitory. At low concentrations of l-glycerol 3-phosphate or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, a plot of initial reaction velocity as a function of l-glycerol 3-phosphate or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide concentration is sigmoidal. No sigmoidicity is seen in plotting of initial reaction velocity as a function of either dihydroxyacetone phosphate or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide under the conditions used. However, a plot of initial reaction velocity as a function of dihydroxyacetone phosphate concentration is sigmoidal in the presence of l-glycerol 3-phosphate but is not sigmoidal in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. On the other hand, a plot of initial reaction velocity as a function of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide concentration is sigmoidal in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide but is not sigmoidal in the presence of l-glycerol 3-phosphate. The results suggest that there are two allosteric sites, one for l-glycerol 3-phosphate and the other for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The binding of l-glycerol 3-phosphate to its allosteric site lowers the Michaelis constant for l-glycerol 3-phosphate but increases the Michaelis constant for dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Similarly, the binding of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to its allosteric site lowers the Michaelis constant for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide but increases the Michaelis constant for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Interestingly, the binding of l-glycerol 3-phosphate to its allosteric site does not change the Michaelis constant for either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or its reduced form. Similarly, the binding of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to its allosteric site does not change the Michaelis constant for either l-glycerol 3-phosphate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate. On the basis of the present study, it is not clear whether dihydroxyacetone phosphate or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide will bind to the allosteric site for l-glycerol 3-phosphate or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1558148900,"Abstract For comparison of the oligonucleotides of highly labeled nucleolar and ribosomal 28 S RNA, the products of complete digestion with pancreatic RNase were separated by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 at pH 7.6. The peaks containing several nonanucleotides, decanucleotides, one undecanucleotide, and one tetradecanucleotide were well defined. To separate the individual oligonucleotides, they were rechromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 at pH 3.3. Sequence studies were carried out by complete digestions with T1 RNase and with alkali and partial digestion with spleen phosphodiesterase. Complete sequences were defined for the nonanucleotides A-A-A-A-G-G-A-A-Cp, A-G-A-G-G-A-A-A-Cp, and G-G-G-A-A-G-A-G-Up. Partial sequences were determined for the nonanucleotides (Gp)(Gp)-(A-Gp)(A-Gp)-A-A-Cp and (A-A-A-A-Gp)(A-Gp)(Gp)Up, the decanucleotides (A-Gp)(Gp)(Gp)(Gp)-A-A-G-G-Up and (A-A-A-Gp)(A-Gp)(Gp)(Gp)(Gp)Up, the undecanucleotide (A-A-Gp)(A-Gp)(C-Gp)(Gp)(Gp)(Gp)Up, and the tetradecanucleotide (A-A-A-A-Gp)(A-Gp)(Gp)(Gp)(Gp)-A-A-A-Cp. In agreement with the hybridization and analytical studies reported earlier, each of the polypurine sequences found in nucleolar 28 S RNA was also isolated from ribosomal 28 S RNA, thereby providing more definitive chemical evidence that the nucleolar 28 S RNA is the precursor of 28 S ribosomal RNA."

We inoculated twenty-eight prenatal, forty-seven newborn, and sixteen 4-week-old A/J mice but failed to obtain positive results, even after 100 days postinoculation. Because we used newborn mice that are usually more susceptible to oncogenic viruses than the older mice used by Prasad et al., and viral concentrates rather than filtrates, we expected to increase our chances of transmission."
