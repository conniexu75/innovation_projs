https://openalex.org/W1968178474,"The innate immune system is critical for the early detection of invading pathogens and for initiating cellular host defence countermeasures, which include the production of type I interferon (IFN). However, little is known about how the innate immune system is galvanized to respond to DNA-based microbes. Here we show that STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is critical for the induction of IFN by non-CpG intracellular DNA species produced by various DNA pathogens after infection. Murine embryonic fibroblasts, as well as antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (exposed to intracellular B-form DNA, the DNA virus herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) or bacteria Listeria monocytogenes), were found to require STING to initiate effective IFN production. Accordingly, Sting-knockout mice were susceptible to lethal infection after exposure to HSV-1. The importance of STING in facilitating DNA-mediated innate immune responses was further evident because cytotoxic T-cell responses induced by plasmid DNA vaccination were reduced in Sting-deficient animals. In the presence of intracellular DNA, STING relocalized with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) from the endoplasmic reticulum to perinuclear vesicles containing the exocyst component Sec5 (also known as EXOC2). Collectively, our studies indicate that STING is essential for host defence against DNA pathogens such as HSV-1 and facilitates the adjuvant activity of DNA-based vaccines."

Determining the variations of microbial communities in feces may be beneficial for the identification of specific profiles in patients with abnormal weights. The roles of the archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii and Lactobacillus species have not been described in these studies.We developed an efficient and robust real-time PCR tool that includes a plasmid-based internal control and allows for quantification of the bacterial divisions Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Lactobacillus as well as the methanogen M. smithii. We applied this technique to the feces of 20 obese subjects, 9 patients with anorexia nervosa, and 20 normal-weight healthy controls. Our results confirmed a reduction in the Bacteroidetes community in obese patients (p<0.01). We found a significantly higher Lactobacillus species concentration in obese patients than in lean controls (p=0.0197) or anorexic patients (p=0.0332). The M. smithii concentration was much higher in anorexic patients than in the lean population (p=0.0171).Lactobacillus species are widely used as growth promoters in the farm industry and are now linked to obesity in humans. The study of the bacterial flora in anorexic patients revealed an increase in M. smithii. This increase might represent an adaptive use of nutrients in this population."

Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) recently identified a role for IFNγ in diet-induced adipose inflammation, obesity, and glucose intolerance in vivo. However, the role and mechanism of IFNγ modulation of adipocyte metabolic functions are poorly understood.The IFNγ receptor consists of two subunits (α and β) that dimerize upon ligand occupation leading to transactivation of Janus family kinases 1 and 2 (JAK1 and 2), tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules with translocation to the nucleus where they regulate gene transcription (20.Bach E.A. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Activation of JAK-STAT pathways potently induces suppressor of cytokine signaling molecules 1 and 3 (SOCS1 and 3) (21.Alexander W.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), which have been implicated in tumor necrosis factor α-induced insulin resistance in adipocyte and hepatic insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo (22.Rui L.

Thus, IFNγ and its JAK-STAT signaling are plausible candidates for inducing adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity.In the current study we demonstrate that IFNγ induces insulin resistance in mature human adipocytes. This effect was time-dependent and remarkably coincided with suppression of insulin signaling molecules, markers of adipocyte differentiation and reduced triglyceride storage. Furthermore, IFNγ completely prevented pre-adipocyte differentiation to mature adipocytes. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway with a non-selective JAK inhibitor abolished all adverse effects of IFNγ in mature adipocytes. In contrast, specific inhibition of JAK2 failed to alleviate IFNγ effects suggesting an important role for JAK1-STAT1 signaling. These studies establish the JAK-STAT pathway as a novel integrative mechanism, and therefore a potential therapeutic target, for modulation of T-cell-mediated adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in human obesity and type 2 diabetes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES2-[1,2-3H]Deoxy-d-glucose was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) human cells were a gift from Dr. Martin Wabitsch, University of Ulm, Germany. Primary human pre-adipocytes were harvested from fresh subcutaneous adipose collected during elective bariatric surgeries at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. JAK inhibitor I (active against all JAK1, -2, -3, and Tyk2), AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor), JAK3 inhibitor I, SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), recombinant human leptin, and bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, low heavy metals) were purchased from Calbiochem (EMD, Germany). Recombinant human IFNγ was purchased from R&D Biosystems (Minneapolis, MN) and recombinant human interleukin-6 (IL-6) was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The PPARγ agonist, GW347845, was a gift from GlaxoSmithKline (King of Prussia, PA). The ApoStrandTM ELISA was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences International, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other reagents, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma.Adipocyte CultureSGBS human adipocytes were cultured as previously described (25.Wabitsch M. Brenner R.E. Melzner I. Braun M. Möller P. Heinze E. Debatin K.M. Hauner H. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Primary human pre-adipocytes were extracted from freshly isolated adipose tissue. Adipose was minced and digested with collagenase (1 mg/ml) (Roche Applied Science). Cells were centrifuged and the stromal vascular pellet resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Human pre-adipocytes were differentiated identically to SGBS cells. Briefly, confluent cells were incubated in differentiation media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, panthothenate (4 mg/liter), biotin (8 mg/liter), insulin (20 nm), hydrocortisone (1 μm), dexamethasone (250 nm), isobutylmethylxanthine (500 μm), PPARγ agonist (GW347845) (2 μm), triiodothyronine (0.2 nm), human transferrin (10 mg/liter), and penicillin/streptomycin) for 7 days. Differentiation media was replaced with 3FC media (differentiation media excluding PPARγ agonist and dexamethasone) for a further 7 days. 3T3L1 fibroblasts were differentiated to adipocytes as previously described (26.Elmendorf J.S. Chen D. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13289-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Glucose Uptake AssaysMature human adipocytes (day 14 post differentiation) were treated with IFNγ (20 ng/ml in serum-free medium (SFM) + 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for the indicated time periods; mock control cells were incubated in SFM + 0.2% BSA alone. At −48 h, medium on all cells was removed and replaced with SFM + 0.2% BSA. Treatments were added sequentially at −48, −24, −8, and −4 h prior to the experimental end point when glucose uptake was monitored. In dose-response studies mature adipocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of IFNγ (0.1 ng/ml-30 ng/ml), prepared in SFM + 0.2% BSA for 48 h, and glucose uptake was monitored. In select experiments, cells were pretreated for 2 h ± kinase inhibitors or ± PPARγ agonist (GW347845; 10 μm) and co-treated with IFNγ ± kinase inhibitors or ± GW347845 (10 μm) for a further 48 h. On the day of glucose-uptake assay, cells were glucose starved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.2% BSA for 30 min prior to insulin (100 nm) stimulation for 15 min. [3H]Deoxyglucose (5 μCi/ml of cold glucose (1 mm)) was added to cells 15 min prior to washing with PBS. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and [3H]glucose uptake was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Remaining lysates were stored for immunoblot analysis. Fold-increase in glucose uptake over basal (non-insulin stimulated) is presented.In select experiments, confluent preadipocytes were treated ± IFNγ throughout differentiation (14 days; days 1–7 in differentiation media, days 7–14 in 3FC media). The effects on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipid accumulation, at oil red staining, were assessed at the end of the 14-day differentiation period.Immunoblot AnalysisProtein concentration was quantified by the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo, Fisher Scientific). Equal concentrations of protein lysate (10 μg) were reduced, separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 5% BSA in TBS-Tween prior to overnight incubation (at 4 °C) in primary antibody. Blots were probed with antibodies to phosphorylated Akt, whole cell Akt, phosphorylated STAT1, phosphorylated STAT3, phosphorylated JAK1, phosphorylated JAK2 (Cell Signaling Technology), whole cell IRS1 (Upstate, Millipore, MA), or β-actin primary antibodies (Abcam). Blots were washed, incubated in secondary antibody, and visualized by chemiluminescence.RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-time PCR AnalysisMature adipocytes (day 14) ± the indicated treatments were harvested in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified spectrophotometrically. Treatments, and mock control, were added consecutively from −48 h, and at the experimental end point all cells were lysed simultaneously. RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed using an Applied Biosystems High Capacity cDNA archive kit. Expression levels of various genes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR using an Applied Biosystems 7300 sequence detector. Primers, probes, and TaqMan Universal Mastermix were purchased from Applied Biosystems (ABI). To control the between sample variability, mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin for each sample by subtracting the Ct for β-actin from the Ct for the gene of interest, producing a ΔCt value. The ΔCt for each treatment sample was compared with the mean ΔCt for control samples using the relative quantitation 2−(ΔΔCt) method to determine fold-change.Oil Red Staining and Triglyceride MeasurementAdipocytes were treated with IFNγ ± kinase inhibitors ± PPARγ agonist (GW347845) (10 μm) prior to fixing in formalin. Cells were washed, incubated with oil red stain for 1 h, rewashed, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear stain was added. Cells were visualized at ×100 magnification using a Nikon diaphot 300 fluorescent microscope. After visualization cells were left to dry, lipid stain was extracted by addition of isopropyl alcohol, and quantitated by reading absorbance at 490 nm. In selective experiments, identically treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer prior to triglyceride quantitation using the Affinity Triglyceride Assay Kit (Thermo Electron).Cell Viability AssaysMature SGBS adipocytes were seeded in 24-well plates (for trypan blue exclusion assay) or 96-well plates (for ApoStrand ELISA) and were differentiated as described above. Mature adipocytes (day 14) were treated ±IFNγ (20 ng/ml) for up to 48 h. Positive control cells were incubated with PBS for 24 h to induce cell death. To test for cell viability, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in trypan blue (0.4% for 5 min). Live and dead cells were counted using a hemocytometer. To test for apoptosis, adipocytes were treated as above and apoptosis was evaluated using the ApoStrand ELISA kit, a single-stranded DNA ELISA kit specific for apoptotic cells. Positive control wells were coated with single-stranded DNA (30 ng/well).Statistical AnalysisData are reported as mean ± S.E. For experiments with multiple treatments, analysis of variance was used to test for differences in means. When analysis of variance was significant, post hoc Bonferroni t tests were applied for group comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).DISCUSSIONRecent studies suggest that loss of Treg cells (11.Winer S. Chan Y. Paltser G. Truong D.

We demonstrate that IFNγ, a prototypical inflammatory T-cell cytokine, induced insulin resistance, down-regulated markers of differentiation, and reduced lipid storage in human adipocytes via the JAK-STAT pathway, most likely mediated through sustained JAK1-STAT1 activation. Our studies establish IFNγ, and the JAK-STAT pathway, as novel mediators of, and potential therapeutic target, for inflammatory T-cell-induced human adipose inflammation and insulin resistance.Adipose tissue inflammation has emerged as a primary mediator of diet and obesity-driven insulin resistance (4.Shoelson S.E.

Hypertrophied adipocytes, observed in obesity, secrete abundant monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which can promote macrophage recruitment into adipose (43.Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Furthermore, resident non-inflammatory M2 macrophages switch to a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype augmenting adipose tissue inflammation (5.Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar, 8.Lumeng C.N. Deyoung S.M. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The trigger that causes adipose macrophage phenotype switching is poorly understood. IFNγ, a primary T-cell-derived cytokine, stimulates macrophages toward an M1 phenotype (18.Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Locati M. Allavena P. Sica A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 549-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that inflammatory T-cell infiltration of adipose, with secretion of IFNγ, plays a role in retention and switching to pro-inflammatory macrophages.Recent work strongly supports this model and goes further by directly implicating inflammatory T-cells and IFNγ in early adipose inflammation and adipocyte dysfunction (11.Winer S.

In the present study, we examined the effects of IFNγ on insulin sensitivity, lipid storage, and differentiation in human adipocytes. We found that IFNγ induced a time-dependent reduction of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and AKT phosphorylation, both indicative of insulin resistance. Dose-response studies demonstrated that IFNγ-induced insulin resistance at concentrations as low as 0.3 ng/ml suggesting modulation of adipocyte functions at local concentrations observed in physiological and pathophysiological settings in vivo. Notably, reduced glucose uptake was not evident until at least 8 h post-treatment suggesting that direct kinase modulation of insulin signaling proteins, such as serine phosphorylation of IRS1, is unlikely to be the primary mechanism of the IFNγ effect. Rather, IFNγ markedly reduced expression of insulin signaling proteins including IR, IRS1, and GLUT4; indeed, reduced IRS1 protein levels were observed after 24 h coincident with reduced glucose uptake.In mature adipocytes, longer term IFNγ treatment markedly reduced triglyceride storage, coincident with striking and sustained suppression of mRNAs for adipogenic genes including PPARγ, fatty acid synthase, lipoprotein lipase, adiponectin, and perilipin. Furthermore, during the 2-week treatment with differentiation medium, addition of IFNγ to pre-adipocytes completely blocked lipid accumulation and insulin-stimulated g"

With the progress in research, Gal-9 has come to be known as a versatile immunomodulator that is involved in various aspects of immune regulations, and the entire picture of the function still remains elusive. To uncover as-yet unknown activity of Gal-9, we have been examining the effect of the protein in various disease animal models. Here we show that Gal-9 attenuated asthmatic reaction in guinea pigs and suppressed passive-cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice. These results indicate the mast cell stabilizing effect of Gal-9. In vitro studies of mast cell degranulation involving RBL-2H3 cells demonstrated that Gal-9 suppressed degranulation from the cells stimulated by IgE plus antigen and that the inhibitory effect was completely abrogated in the presence of lactose, indicating lectin activity of Gal-9 is critical. We found that Gal-9 strongly and specifically bound IgE, which is a heavily glycosylated immunoglobulin, and that the interaction prevented IgE-antigen complex formation, clarifying the mode of action of the anti-degranulation effect. Gal-9 is expressed by several mast cells including mouse mast cell line MC/9. The fact that immunological stimuli of MC/9 cells augmented Gal-9 secretion from the cells implies that Gal-9 is an autocrine regulator of mast cell function to suppress excessive degranulation. Collectively, these findings shed light on a novel function of Gal-9 in mast cells and suggest a beneficial utility of Gal-9 for the treatment of allergic disorders including asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2064542330,"Background There is a commonly held assumption that early August is an unsafe period to be admitted to hospital in England, as newly qualified doctors start work in NHS hospitals on the first Wednesday of August. We investigate whether in-hospital mortality is higher in the week following the first Wednesday in August than in the previous week. Methodology A retrospective study in England using administrative hospital admissions data. Two retrospective cohorts of all emergency patients admitted on the last Wednesday in July and the first Wednesday in August for 2000 to 2008, each followed up for one week. Principal Findings The odds of death for patients admitted on the first Wednesday in August was 6% higher (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.15, p = 0.05) after controlling for year, gender, age, socio-economic deprivation and co-morbidity. When subdivided into medical, surgical and neoplasm admissions, medical admissions admitted on the first Wednesday in August had an 8% (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16, p = 0.03) higher odds of death. In 2007 and 2008, when the system for junior doctors' job applications changed, patients admitted on Wednesday August 1st had 8% higher adjusted odds of death than those admitted the previous Wednesday, but this was not statistically significant (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.23, p = 0.24). Conclusions We found evidence that patients admitted on the first Wednesday in August have a higher early death rate in English hospitals compared with patients admitted on the previous Wednesday. This was higher for patients admitted with a medical primary diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2138985888,"In plants, the phytohormone auxin is a crucial regulator sustaining growth and development. At the cellular level, auxin is interpreted differentially in a tissue- and dose-dependent manner. Mechanisms of auxin signalling are partially unknown and the contribution of the AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) as an auxin receptor is still a matter of debate.Here we took advantage of the present knowledge of the root biological system to demonstrate that ABP1 is required for auxin response. The use of conditional ABP1 defective plants reveals that the protein is essential for maintenance of the root meristem and acts at least on the D-type CYCLIN/RETINOBLASTOMA pathway to control entry into the cell cycle. ABP1 affects PLETHORA gradients and confers auxin sensitivity to root cells thus defining the competence of the cells to be maintained within the meristem or to elongate. ABP1 is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression in response to auxin.Our data support that ABP1 is a key regulator for root growth and is required for auxin-mediated responses. Differential effects of ABP1 on various auxin responses support a model in which ABP1 is the major regulator for auxin action on the cell cycle and regulates auxin-mediated gene expression and cell elongation in addition to the already well known TIR1-mediated ubiquitination pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2135049215,"Destruction of the architectural and subsequently the functional integrity of the lung following pulmonary viral infections is attributable to both the extent of pathogen replication and to the host-generated inflammation associated with the recruitment of immune responses. The presence of antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence of novel viruses assures the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection. Thus, there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune responses in the lung but which limits immune-mediated lung damage. The immunoprophylactic strategy described here utilizes a protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary infection and also results in a host immune response that causes less lung damage.Mice pre-treated with PCN, independent of any specific viral antigens, were protected against both sub-lethal and lethal doses of two different influenza viruses, a mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus, or mouse pneumovirus. Treatment with PCN significantly increased survival and was marked by enhanced viral clearance, accelerated induction of viral-specific antibody production, and significant decreases in morbidity and lung damage. The enhanced protection appears to be dependent upon the prior development of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the lung in response to the PCN treatment and to be mediated through CD4+ T cell and B cell dependent mechanisms.The immunoprophylactic strategy described utilizes an infection-independent induction of naturally occurring iBALT prior to infection by a pulmonary viral pathogen. This strategy non-specifically enhances primary immunity to respiratory viruses and is not restricted by the antigen specificities inherent in typical vaccination strategies. PCN treatment is asymptomatic in its application and importantly, ameliorates the damaging inflammation normally associated with the recruitment of immune responses into the lung."

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the expression, affinity, and density of A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 adenosine receptors (ARs) and D2 dopamine receptors (D2Rs) in PD. An increase in A2AAR density in putamen was found. The presence and functionality of ARs in human lymphocyte and neutrophil membranes from patients with PD revealed a specific A2AAR alteration compared with healthy subjects. A statistically significant linear correlation among the A2AAR density, functionality, or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score was reported. Adenosine concentration and TNF-α levels were increased in plasma of patients with PD. In rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, a widely useful model, adenosine antagonists decreased dopamine uptake, and an opposite effect was mediated by A2A agonists. This is the first report showing the presence of an A2AAR alteration in putamen in PD that mirrors a similar up-regulation in human peripheral blood cells. Moreover, the correlation found between A2AAR density or A2A agonist potency and UPDRS motor score highlights the central role of A2AARs in the pharmacological treatment of PD.—Varani, K., Vincenzi, F., Tosi, A., Gessi, S., Casetta, I., Granieri, G., Fazio, P., Leung, E., MacLennan, S., Granieri, E., Borea, P.

https://openalex.org/W2018224902,"Dengue fever is an emerging viral disease transmitted by arthropods to humans in tropical countries. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is escalating in frequency and mortality rates. Here we studied the involvement of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in dengue virus (DENV) infection and its pathogenesis. Patients with DHF had elevated plasma concentrations of MIF. Both leukocytes from these patients and macrophages from healthy donors infected in vitro with DENV showed a substantial amount of MIF within lipid droplets. The secretion of MIF by macrophages and hepatocytes required a productive infection and occurred without an increase in gene transcription or cell death, thus indicating active secretion from preformed stocks. In vivo infection of wild-type and mif-deficient (Mif(-/-)) mice demonstrated a role of MIF in dengue pathogenesis. Clinical disease was less severe in Mif(-/-) mice, and they exhibited a significant delay in lethality, lower viremia, and lower viral load in the spleen than wild-type mice. This reduction in all parameters of severity on DENV infection in Mif(-/-) mice correlated with reduced proinflammatory cytokine concentrations. These results demonstrated the contribution of MIF to the pathogenesis of dengue and pointed to a possible beneficial role of neutralizing MIF as an adjunctive therapeutic approach to treat the severe forms of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2015991580,"Background In humans and mice naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (nTregs) are a thymus-derived subset of T cells, crucial for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance by controlling not only potentially autoreactive T cells but virtually all cells of the adaptive and innate immune system. Recent work using Dicer-deficient mice irrevocably demonstrated the importance of miRNAs for nTreg cell-mediated tolerance. Principal Findings DNA-Microarray analyses of human as well as murine conventional CD4+ Th cells and nTregs revealed a strong up-regulation of mature miR-155 (microRNA-155) upon activation in both populations. Studying miR-155 expression in FoxP3-deficient scurfy mice and performing FoxP3 ChIP-Seq experiments using activated human T lymphocytes, we show that the expression and maturation of miR-155 seem to be not necessarily regulated by FoxP3. In order to address the functional relevance of elevated miR-155 levels, we transfected miR-155 inhibitors or mature miR-155 RNAs into freshly-isolated human and mouse primary CD4+ Th cells and nTregs and investigated the resulting phenotype in nTreg suppression assays. Whereas miR-155 inhibition in conventional CD4+ Th cells strengthened nTreg cell-mediated suppression, overexpression of mature miR-155 rendered these cells unresponsive to nTreg cell-mediated suppression. Conclusion Investigation of FoxP3 downstream targets, certainly of bound and regulated miRNAs revealed the associated function between the master regulator FoxP3 and miRNAs as regulators itself. miR-155 is shown to be crucially involved in nTreg cell mediated tolerance by regulating the susceptibility of conventional human as well as murine CD4+ Th cells to nTreg cell-mediated suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2164612151,"Polycystin-1 (PC-1), the product of the PKD1 gene, mutated in the majority of cases of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), is a very large (∼520 kDa) plasma membrane receptor localized in several subcellular compartments including cell-cell/matrix junctions as well as cilia. While heterologous over-expression systems have allowed identification of several of the potential biological roles of this receptor, its precise function remains largely elusive. Studying PC-1 in vivo has been a challenging task due to its complexity and low expression levels. To overcome these limitations and facilitate the study of endogenous PC-1, we have inserted HA- or Myc-tag sequences into the Pkd1 locus by homologous recombination. Here, we show that our approach was successful in generating a fully functional and easily detectable endogenous PC-1. Characterization of PC-1 distribution in vivo showed that it is expressed ubiquitously and is developmentally-regulated in most tissues. Furthermore, our novel tool allowed us to investigate the role of PC-1 in brain, where the protein is abundantly expressed. Subcellular localization of PC-1 revealed strong and specific staining in ciliated ependymal and choroid plexus cells. Consistent with this distribution, we observed hydrocephalus formation both in the ubiquitous knock-out embryos and in newborn mice with conditional inactivation of the Pkd1 gene in the brain. Both choroid plexus and ependymal cilia were morphologically normal in these mice, suggesting a role for PC-1 in ciliary function or signalling in this compartment, rather than in ciliogenesis. We propose that the role of PC-1 in the brain cilia might be to prevent hydrocephalus, a previously unrecognized role for this receptor and one that might have important implications for other genetic or sporadic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2000226216,"Foam cell formation is a hallmark event during atherosclerosis. The current paradigm is that lipid uptake by scavenger receptor in macrophages initiates the chronic proinflammatory cascade and necrosis core formation that characterize atherosclerosis. We report here that a cytokine considered to be anti-atherogenic, interleukin-10 (IL10), promotes cholesterol uptake from modified lipoproteins in macrophages and its transformation into foam cells by increasing the expression of scavenger receptor CD36 and scavenger receptor A. Although uptake of modified lipoproteins is considered proatherogenic, we found that IL10 also increases cholesterol efflux from macrophages to protect against toxicity of free cholesterol accumulation in the cell. This process was PPARgamma-dependent and was mediated through up-regulation of ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) protein expression. Importantly, expression of inflammatory molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and MMP9 as well as apoptosis were dramatically suppressed in lipid-laden foam cells treated with IL10. The notion that IL10 can mediate both the uptake of cholesterol from modified lipoproteins and the efflux of stored cholesterol suggests that the process of foam cell formation is not necessarily detrimental as long as mechanisms of cholesterol efflux and transfer to an exogenous acceptor are functioning robustly. Our results present a comprehensive antiatherogenic role of IL10 in macrophages, including enhanced disposal of harmful lipoproteins, inhibition of inflammatory molecules, and reduced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026749159,"Isothiocyanates are a class of phytochemicals with widely reported anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activity. However, knowledge of their activity at a molecular level is limited. The objective of this study was to identify biological targets of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) using an affinity purification approach. An analogue of PEITC was synthesized to enable conjugation to a solid-phase resin. The pleiotropic cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was the major protein captured from cell lysates. Site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry showed that PEITC covalently modified the N-terminal proline residue of MIF. This resulted in complete loss of catalytic tautomerase activity and disruption of protein conformation, as determined by impaired recognition by a monoclonal antibody directed to the region that receptors and interacting proteins bind to MIF. The conformational change was supported by in silico modeling. Monoclonal antibody binding to plasma MIF was disrupted in humans consuming watercress, a major dietary source of PEITC. The isothiocyanates have significant potential for development as MIF inhibitors, and this activity may contribute to the biological properties of these phytochemicals."

In the present work, we have extended previous studies in actively respiring HepG2 cells to further investigate the relative effect of Δψ and ΔpH on the control coefficient of CcOX, but under phosphorylating state 3 conditions (11.Piccoli C.

We have shown that in intact cells, where the ATP synthase is not impaired by inhibitors, the metabolic control exerted by CcOX over the respiratory chain depends on Δψ. Our results also suggest that the depressing effect over respiration of ΔμH+ affects the distribution of control among the individual steps of the oxidative phosphorylation system.

Aliquots of the cell suspension were distributed into the 1.5-ml chambers of a dual chamber standalone high resolution respirometer (Oxygraph-2k, Oroboros Instruments) to monitor the endogenous cell O2 consumption and, in parallel, the CcOX specific activity at 37 °C. When indicated, ionophores were used at the lowest concentration causing maximal stimulation of respiration (i.e. 33 nm valinomycin or 100 nm nigericin or a combination of both substances). Cyanide sensitivity was assayed by sequential addition of the inhibitor (using 80 mm or 8 mm NaCN stock solutions). According to Refs. 11.Piccoli C. Scrima R. Boffoli D. Capitanio N. Biochem.

At the concentration used, TMPD did not significantly reduces mitochondrial Δψ, as assessed using the fluorimetric dye JC1 in cell suspensions (data not shown). Based on the metabolic control analysis (19.Kacser H. Burns J.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1979; 7: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 20.Moreno-Sánchez R. Bravo C. Westerhoff H.V. Eur.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the control coefficient of CcOX (CIV) was calculated from the cyanide-titration profile of the global cell respiration and the CcOX specific activity, according to the following equation, CIV=S1/S2(Eq. 1) where S1 = (dJ/dI)I→0 and S2 = (dv/dI)I→0, J is the global O2 consumption rate, v is the specific activity of CcOX, and I is the cyanide concentration. The experimental error of CIV (ϵC(IV)) has been evaluated as follows, εC(IV)=CIV(ε1S1)2+(ε2S2)2(Eq. 2) where ϵ1 and ϵ2 are the S.D. of S1 and S2. The effect of ΔμH+ on the metabolic control of cytochrome c oxidase over cell respiration was investigated by performing cyanide titrations of both the endogenous respiration (global activity) and the O2 consumption sustained by the sole CcOX (specific activity) in intact HepG2 cells. To gather information on the relative effect of the electrical and the chemical component of ΔμH+, measurements were carried out in the absence and presence of ionophores specifically collapsing either Δψ (valinomycin) or ΔpH (nigericin). Data reported in Table 1 indicate that, in the absence of ionophores, cell respiration sustained by endogenous substrates proceeds at a rate of 62.8 ± 20.8 pmol O2·s−1·106 cells−1 that is almost completely (≥95%) abolished by 1 mm NaCN or 20 nm antimycin A (data not shown). This rate is only slightly stimulated in the presence of 100 nm nigericin, whereas it increases by ∼2–3-fold upon addition of 33 nm valinomycin alone or in combination with nigericin (132.7 ± 55.1 and 182.3 ± 69.1 pmol O2·s−1·106 cells−1, respectively). No significant changes were observed at the level of specific activity regardless of the presence of ionophores.TABLE 1Rate of oxygen consumption (±S.D.) in HepG2 cells in the absence and in the presence of ionophores.

As expected, upon sequential additions of cyanide to the respiring cells, the O2 consumption rate decreases in a concentration dependent manner. In the absence of ionophores, both the global (Fig. 1A) and the specific activity (Fig. 1B) are affected by cyanide to a similar extent and particularly in the low cyanide concentration range (0–16 μm), critical for estimation of the CcOX control coefficient (CIV). In particular, at 16 μm NaCN (Fig. 1, addition d), the global and the CcOX specific residual activities are comparable (88 and 83% of the corresponding initial values, respectively), strongly indicating that the control coefficient approaches the unity under these conditions. In the presence of valinomycin, converting Δψ into ΔpH, the global activity is less sensitive to cyanide than the CcOX specific activity (compare panels C and D in Fig. 1); i.e. at 16 μm NaCN, the residual global activity is up to 95%, whereas the specific activity of CcOX is ∼81%. In other words, low concentration values of cyanide, while inhibiting CcOX, are still insufficient to significantly affect the endogenous respiration of valinomycin-treated cells, pointing to a low control coefficient of the enzyme (Table 2).TABLE 2Flux control coefficients of CcOX over endogenous respiration in HepG2 cells in the absence and in the presence of ionophores. Error analysis is under “Experimental Procedures.”Control coefficient (CIV)Control0.73 ± 0.06+Valinomycin0.30 ± 0.03+Nigericin0.85 ± 0.07+Valinomycin and nigericin0.77 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab The effect of valinomycin is better appreciated in Fig. 2, summarizing the results of cyanide titration experiments carried out with untreated cells (A) or after addition of valinomycin (B), nigericin (C), or both the ionophores (D). For each condition, the residual global and CcOX specific activities (open and closed circles, respectively), measured in the presence of increasing amounts of cyanide, are expressed as percentages of the uninhibited respiration rate and reported as a function of the inhibitor concentration. The data were obtained by averaging the results of a series of titration experiments similar to those reported in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 clearly shows that the data points corresponding to the global and the CcOX specific activities markedly diverge only in valinomycin-treated cells (panel B, when Δψ is converted into ΔpH). Indeed, under that condition, the CcOX specific activity (closed circles) is more sensitive to cyanide than the global one (open circles), whereas under all the other conditions explored, the initial slopes of the curves are similar. As a result, the flux control coefficient, calculated as the ratio of the initial slope in the curve profile of the global and specific CcOX activities (see Eq. 1), is low in the presence of valinomycin, whereas it takes higher values approaching unity in the other cases (cf. Table 2). This finding strongly suggests that Δψ increases the control coefficient of CcOX over cell respiration. The role of ΔpH on the control coefficient of CcOX was investigated by carrying out cyanide titrations in the presence of nigericin, a K+/H+ antiporter, which converts the mitochondrial ΔpH into Δψ; the titration profiles of both the global and specific activities in Fig. 2C and the corresponding flux coefficient values are comparable with those acquired in the untreated cells. The abolishment of ΔμH+ by the simultaneous addition of nigericin and valinomycin to the cell suspension was also achieved. As shown in Fig. 2D, under these conditions, CcOX exerts a high metabolic control over respiration, based on the finding that the specific CcOX activity and the endogenous cell respiration display similar cyanide sensitivity, particularly in the low cyanide concentration range. Fig. 3 shows the threshold plots relative to our data; the residual endogenous cell respiration rate at any given cyanide concentration is plotted as a function of the percentage of cyanide-inhibited CcOX in the sample. Two different threshold profiles have been observed: the profile for valinomycin-treated cells has a markedly curved shape, and 50% inhibition of CcOX by cyanide results in only 15–20% decrease of the global flux. Under all the other conditions (i.e. untreated cells or both in the presence of nigericin alone and in combination with valinomycin), the profiles appear significantly less curved. Particularly, under fully uncoupled conditions, the CcOX inhibition correlates almost linearly with that of the global respiratory flux. Therefore, in untreated cells, the CcOX control over cell respiration is fairly high, whereas when Δψ is converted into ΔpH, the CcOX control is markedly reduced. MCA applied to isolated mitochondria showed that the control of the respiratory rate is distributed among several steps, depending on fluxes and availability of the mitochondrial substrates (10.Mazat J.P. Rossignol R. Malgat M. Rocher C. Faustin B. Letellier T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Besides the respiratory chain complexes, proton leakage, phosphate carrier, pyruvate carrier, ATP synthase, and adenine nucleotide carrier have been found to exert some control over oxidative phosphorylation. The control exerted by the electron transport chain complexes increases, however, when evaluated in experimental systems closer to in vivo conditions (22.Kunz W.S. Kudin A. Vielhaber S. Elger C.E.

Med. 2000; 29: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The higher control coefficient value in cells rather than in isolated mitochondria (11.Piccoli C. Scrima R. Boffoli D. Capitanio N. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the low inhibition threshold level (20% for several human cell lines (25.Villani G. Attardi G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)) measured for CcOX under near physiological conditions point to a tight control of the enzyme in intact cells (25.Villani G. Attardi G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because CcOX activity is reportedly influenced by the proton electrochemical gradient (see below), we have focused our attention on the role of ΔμH+ and its electrochemical components (Δψ and ΔpH) on the activity of CcOX and the control of the enzyme over cell respiration in whole HepG2 cells. The main result presented is that, under near physiological conditions, the control of CcOX over cell respiration predominantly depends on the electrical component (Δψ) of the proton electrochemical gradient. This finding is fully consistent with a large body of previous spectroscopic (1.Brunori M. Giuffrè A. Sarti P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13.Sarti P. Malatesta F. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) measurements carried out using CcOX reconstituted into artificial phospholipid vesicles. Those experiments provide a possible mechanistic explanation of how the membrane potential controls the activity of the enzyme: the rate-limiting step in the CcOX catalytic cycle, i.e. the internal electron transfer from heme a to the oxidized heme a3/CuB site, was shown to be coupled to both a vectorial H+ uptake from the mitochondrial N-phase and H+ translocation to the P-phase, synchronous with the redox reaction (28.Bloch D. Belevich I. Jasaitis A. Ribacka C. Puustinen A. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The electron transfer process is thus electrogenic and it consistently slows down in the presence of a suitable ΔΨ (≥180 mV in COV, (13.Sarti P. Malatesta F. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5554-5560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Altogether, these findings support the original proposal by Brunori et al. (3.Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar, 14.Brunori M. Sarti P. Colosimo A. Antonini G. Malatesta F. Jones M.G. Wilson M.T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2365-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that ΔΨ stabilizes CcOX in a state characterized by a lower rate of internal electron transfer and thus a lower turnover rate. This stabilization is removed by valinomycin, selectively converting ΔΨ into ΔpH and allows the enzyme to turn over more rapidly (molecular basis of the respiratory control ratio in CcOX vesicles). Consistently, we show that the addition of valinomycin to HepG2 cells decreases the control coefficient from CIV = 0.73 to CIV = 0.30, indicating that Δψ contributes to the control exerted by CcOX in the cell. This finding might appear in contrast with the report of Piccoli et al. (11.Piccoli C. Scrima R. Boffoli D. Capitanio N. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which showed minor effects of valinomycin on the CcOX control coefficient evaluated in the same cell line. The discrepancy, however, is only apparent because those experiments, differently from the present work, were carried out in the presence of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, i.e. in state 4 condition. Under these conditions, ΔμH+ is likely maximal, and most of the control over respiration is exerted by the H+ back leak into the matrix rather than by CcOX or by any other respiratory chain complex (11.Piccoli C. Scrima R. Boffoli D. Capitanio N. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29.Brand M.D. Hafner R.P. Brown G.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 535-539PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the collapse of Δψ by valinomycin cannot significantly affect the control exerted by CcOX. Conversely, our data show that, in actively phosphorylating cells, Δψ is responsible for the CcOX tight control over respiration, whereas under the same condition, ΔpH seems irrelevant in this respect, as the addition of nigericin is essentially ineffective. The effect of valinomycin on the CIV appears fully consistent with the results of rapid mixing experiments carried out using CcOX vesicles (13.Sarti P. Malatesta F. Antonini G. Vallone B. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5554-5560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Brunori M. Sarti P. Colosimo A. Antonini G. Malatesta F. Jones M.G. Wilson M.T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2365-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). According to the MCA theory, all of the control coefficients of the steps involved in an integrated process should sum to one (summation theorem (21.Kholodenko B.N. Westerhoff H.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). Thus, in the presence of valinomycin, in response to a decrease of the CcOX flux control, a compensatory increase of the control level of other steps is expected. The chemical H+ gradient (ΔpH) is expected to increase at the expense of the electrical component and to balance the dissipation of mitochondrial Δψ. Under these conditions, the respiratory complexes whose activity is more sensitive to ΔpH (30.Lorusso M. Cocco T. Minuto M. Capitanio N. Papa S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 31.Papa S. Lorusso M. Izzo G. Capuano F. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), i.e. those upstream CcOX, likely increase their control over respiration. When both ΔpH and Δψ collapse, as in the presence of both valinomycin and nigericin, the enzymes upstream CcOX may lose such control. Consistently, our and previous data (11.Piccoli C. Scrima R. Boffoli D. Capitanio N. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12.Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) show that the abolishment of ΔμH+ leads to a high CIV over respiration and suggest that other factors, such as substrate concentration and level of effectors, may limit CcOX activity under these conditions (25.Villani G. Attardi G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and account for the high control over respiration. We observed two different types of threshold plots (Fig. 3). In the presence of valinomycin alone, the data show a plateau phase in which inhibition of up to 30–40% CcOX modestly affects the overall respiratory flux. Thus, when Δψ is converted into ΔpH, there is an excess of functional capacity of CcOX. Under all of the other conditions examined (control cells alone or plus nigericin in the presence/absence of valinomycin), a clear threshold is not detected consistent with a higher control of CcOX corresponding to a smaller threshold value (10.Mazat J.P. Rossignol R. Malgat M. Rocher C. Faustin B. Letellier T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To summarize, we have demonstrated that in intact cells under phosphorylating conditions (i.e. with fully active ATP synthase), CcOX activity and its control over oxidative phosphorylation are dependent on Δψ. The Δψ dependence suggests that specific mutations associated to a diminished CcOX efficiency and/or an altered Δψ/ΔpH balance (32.Namslauer I. Brzezinski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) may change the distribution of control in the respiratory metabolic pathway and therefore the specific tissue susceptibility to diseases."

The transient time leading to entrainment plays a major role in many biological processes. Our goal is to unveil the specific dynamics that leads to fast entrainment. By studying a generic model, we characterize the transient time to entrainment and show how it is governed by two basic properties of an oscillator: the radial relaxation time and the phase velocity distribution around the limit cycle. Those two basic properties are inherent in every oscillator. This concept can be applied to many biological systems to predict the average transient time to entrainment or to infer properties of the underlying oscillator from the observed transients. We found that both a sinusoidal oscillator with fast radial relaxation and a spike-like oscillator with slow radial relaxation give rise to fast entrainment. As an example, we discuss the jet-lag experiments in the mammalian circadian pacemaker."
https://openalex.org/W2171177974,"Bacilysin is a non-ribosomally synthesized dipeptide antibiotic that is active against a wide range of bacteria and some fungi. Synthesis of bacilysin (l-alanine-[2,3-epoxycyclohexano-4]-l-alanine) is achieved by proteins in the bac operon, also referred to as the bacABCDE (ywfBCDEF) gene cluster in B. subtilis. Extensive genetic analysis from several strains of B. subtilis suggests that the bacABC gene cluster encodes all the proteins that synthesize the epoxyhexanone ring of l-anticapsin. These data, however, were not consistent with the putative functional annotation for these proteins whereby BacA, a prephenate dehydratase along with a potential isomerase/guanylyl transferase, BacB and an oxidoreductase, BacC, could synthesize l-anticapsin. Here we demonstrate that BacA is a decarboxylase that acts on prephenate. Further, based on the biochemical characterization and the crystal structure of BacB, we show that BacB is an oxidase that catalyzes the synthesis of 2-oxo-3-(4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dienyl)propanoic acid, a precursor to l-anticapsin. This protein is a bi-cupin, with two putative active sites each containing a bound metal ion. Additional electron density at the active site of the C-terminal domain of BacB could be interpreted as a bound phenylpyruvic acid. A significant decrease in the catalytic activity of a point variant of BacB with a mutation at the N-terminal domain suggests that the N-terminal cupin domain is involved in catalysis."

The yeast Hmg2p isozyme is subject to ubiquitin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum degradation by the HRD pathway. We had previously shown that alterations in cellular levels of the 15-carbon sterol pathway intermediate farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) cause increased Hmg2p ubiquitination and degradation. We now present evidence that the FPP-derived, 20-carbon molecule geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) is a potent endogenous regulator of Hmg2p degradation. This work was launched by the unexpected observation that GGPP addition directly to living yeast cultures caused high potency and specific stimulation of Hmg2p degradation. This effect of GGPP was not recapitulated by FPP, GGOH, or related isoprenoids. GGPP-caused Hmg2p degradation met all the criteria for the previously characterized endogenous signal. The action of added GGPP did not require production of endogenous sterol molecules, indicating that it did not act by causing the build-up of an endogenous pathway signal. Manipulation of endogenous GGPP by several means showed that naturally made GGPP controls Hmg2p stability. Analysis of the action of GGPP indicated that the molecule works upstream of retrotranslocation and can directly alter the structure of Hmg2p. We propose that GGPP is the FPP-derived regulator of Hmg2p ubiquitination. Intriguingly, the sterol-dependent degradation of mammalian HMGR is similarly stimulated by the addition of GGOH to intact cells, implying that a dependence on 20-carbon geranylgeranyl signals may be a common conserved feature of HMGR regulation that may lead to highly specific therapeutic approaches for modulation of HMGR. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzymes of sterol synthesis, undergoes feedback-regulated endoplasmic reticulum degradation in both mammals and yeast.

The sterol or mevalonate pathway is highly conserved and essential in eukaryotes. Sterol synthesis entails stepwise construction of 5-carbon isoprenes from acetyl CoA, followed by condensations, cyclizations, and modifications to form the wide array of sterol and non-sterol products produced by this versatile biosynthetic route (see Ref. 1.Lange B.M.

Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When sterol pathway flux is high, HMGR degradation is fast, and steady state levels tend to be low. When sterol pathway flux is slowed, the degradation rate is slowed, and HMGR levels tend to rise. In this way, the amount of HMGR is altered to meet changing cellular demand for sterol pathway products. The HMGR molecule consists of a globular C-terminal catalytic domain, connected to a multispanning ER anchor. The N-terminal multispanning transmembrane domain is responsible for regulated degradation, whereas the catalytic region can function autonomously and is not subject to regulation when freed from its ER anchor. Conversely, the N-terminal transmembrane region of HMGR is sufficient for feedback regulated degradation, allowing fusion of reporter genes such as lacZ or GFP to facilitate biochemical and genetic analysis of this process. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl endoplasmic reticulum farnesyl pyrophosphate green fluorescent protein geranylgeraniol geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate squalene synthase zaragozic acid farnesol 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid protease inhibitor N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone geranylgeranyl transferase wild type. Feedback regulation of HMGR stability is observed in both mammals and yeast. As an avenue toward understanding the mechanistic details of HMGR-regulated degradation, we have been studying this process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using a combination of techniques made facile in this guide organism (2.Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y. Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Yeast expresses two isozymes of HMGR, Hmg1p and Hmg2p; Hmg1p is quite stable, whereas Hmg2p undergoes sterol pathway-regulated degradation. Hmg2p degradation depends on its multispanning N-terminal anchor, with a half-life that varies between ∼10 min and many hours depending on the level of degradation signal from the sterol pathway. Hmg2p degradation proceeds by the HRD (HMG-CoA reductase degradation) pathway (2.Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y. Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3.Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 4.Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), mediated by the Hrd1p ubiquitin ligase and a variety of other factors. The HRD pathway is also a principle pathway of ER-associated degradation, responsible for the destruction of numerous misfolded and damaged proteins in the ER lumen or membrane. Thus, regulated Hmg2p degradation occurs by signals from the sterol pathway promoting Hmg2p entry into the HRD quality control pathway, possibly by selective misfolding of the normal Hmg2p molecule to a structure that is recognized as a misfolded protein by the HRD apparatus. In our analyses of the sterol pathway signals that accelerate Hmg2p degradation, we discovered that altering cellular levels of 15-carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) causes striking changes in Hmg2p stability (5.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Increasing FPP by lowering the activity of the FPP-utilizing enzyme squalene synthase (SS), either by pharmaceutical or genetic means, causes increased ubiquitination and degradation of Hmg2p. Conversely, lowering cellular FPP levels either by upstream inhibition of its production or by overexpression of SS slows degradation of Hmg2p. Thus, we have long thought that the signal was FPP or an FPP-derived isoprenoid. Direct studies on the structure of Hmg2p using limited proteolysis and thermal denaturation assays indicated that isoprenoids can directly alter the structure of Hmg2p, causing a reversible misfolding of the protein that might make it more susceptible to the HRD pathway (6.Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 188-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7.Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because the most effective lipid in these assays was farnesol (FOH), derived from FPP, we speculated that either farnesol was the FPP-derived regulator or that the FPP itself employed this feature of its structure to accelerate Hmg2p degradation. Recently, in an attempt to directly stimulate Hmg2p degradation, as opposed to using drugs or mutants to alter the endogenous, FPP-derived signal, we tested the effect of directly adding various pathway molecules to intact cells of the highly permeable pdr5Δ null strain. The ability to directly stimulate Hmg2p degradation would allow more refined analysis of both the signal and the process of regulated HRD-dependent Hmg2p degradation. To our surprise, we found a highly specific potent effect of the extended 20-carbon geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is a natural derivative of FPP, but no effect of any other lipid tested including the primary candidate FPP. GGPP caused specific stimulation of Hmg2p ubiquitination and degradation. In fact, GGPP was equally effective in normal yeast without the pdr5Δ mutation, apparently crossing the intact yeast membrane and cell wall despite its large size and high charge. Moving forward from this serendipitous observation, we have conducted a detailed analysis of the root of this effect and have concluded from the studies below that endogenously synthesized GGPP is in all likelihood the physiological, FPP-derived regulator of Hmg2p degradation. A clear but poorly understood role for geranylgeranyl lipids in regulated degradation of mammalian HMGR has been reported (8.Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), thus providing an intriguing new connection between HMGR regulation in yeast and mammals. In addition, this non-sterol mechanism of stability regulation may direct us to new approaches to modulating HMGR for clinical benefit. Isoprenoids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lovastatin and zaragozic acid were gifts from Merck. Strains were derived from the S288C-derivative genetic background except for strains obtained from other laboratories. Yeast were grown at 30 °C with aeration as described previously (3.Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) or at 25 and 37 °C where indicated. The cultures were logarithmically grown in minimal medium with 2% glucose and appropriate amino acid supplements to an A600 of <0.35. Standard yeast techniques were used to introduce plasmids, prepare gene deletions, and incorporate mutant alleles. The yeast strains are listed in supplemental Table S1. RHY1015 was previously described (5.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The bts1Δ null strain was made by PCR-mediated homologous recombination of the nourseothricin gene (NatR) flanked by 50 base pairs of homology of the BTS1 coding region. Null was confirmed by cold temperature sensitivity at 17 °C and PCR. All of the primer sequences are available upon request. The geranylgeranyl transferase type I subunit mutant allele bet2-1 strain and its corresponding wild type were provided by Susan Ferro-Novick (University of California, San Diego) (9.Jiang Y. Proteau P. Poulter D. Ferro-Novick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21793-21799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the strain carrying the type II subunit mutant allele cdc43-2 was provided by Jasper Rine (University of California, Berkeley) (10.Trueblood C.E. Ohya Y. Rine J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 4260-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cdc43-2 allele was complemented by the expression of CDC43 on a CEN plasmid to serve as the control strain. This plasmid was constructed by subcloning CDC43 from YEp(43)2 (also received from the laboratory of J. Rine) into pRS415. Complementation was confirmed by growth at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C. The plasmid carrying the GAL1 promoter-driven BTS1 was a gift from Seichi Matsuda (Rice University, Houston, TX). Plasmids YEpM6PN and YEpM6G53E, expressing MRS6 and mutant mrs6G53E, respectively, were provided by Antonella Ragnini-Wilson (University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy) and described previously (11.Bauer B.E.

Ragnini A. Yeast. 2001; 18: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was carried out as previously described (13.Cronin S.R. Hampton R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 302: 58-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Cronin S.R. Khoury A. Ferry D.K. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Yeast grown in minimal medium with 2% glucose and appropriate amino acids into log phase (A600 < 0.2) were incubated with mevalonate pathway isoprenoid intermediates (typically 11 μm unless indicated differently), zaragozic acid (10 μg/ml), lovastatin (25 μg/ml), vehicle (for GGPP and other isoprenoids, this consisted of addition of the same volume of the solution 3 parts 1 mm ammonia and 7 parts methanol), or cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) for the times indicated. The BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer measured the individual fluorescence of 10,000 cells. CellQuest software was used to analyze the data and plotted fluorescence versus cell count histograms. Preparation of whole cell lysates was previously described (15.Gardner R. Cronin S. Leader B. Rine J. Hampton R. Leder B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2611-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After each time indicated with GGPP (11 μm) or vehicle incubation, the cells were pelleted (1 optical density equivalent) and resuspended in 100 μl of SUME (1% SDS, 8 m urea, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA) with the following protease inhibitors (PIs): 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm leupeptin hemisulfate, 76 mm pepstatin A, and 142 mm TPCK. 100 μl of acid-washed glass beads were added to suspension, and the cells were broken by vortexing three times for 1-min intervals with 1-min intervals on ice between each vortexing. Following the addition of 100 μl of 2× urea sample buffer (2× USB: 8 m urea, 4% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8), the slurry was incubated at 50 °C for 10 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g. The proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane blots. 5% nonfat-dried milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBS-T: 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) was used to block blots, and 2% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T was used in antibody incubations. Hmg2p-GFP was detected with anti-GFP (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and 1myc-Hmg2-GFP with anti-Myc 9E-10 antibody (hybridoma from ATCC (Manassas, VA)). Goat anti-mouse conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) recognized primary antibodies. Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for immunodetection. Yeast cells were grown in minimum medium to an optical density of 0.3 optical density/ml. The cells were pelleted at 2500 rpm and resuspended with 4 ml of fresh medium. Either 4 μl of Me2SO or ZA was added or 20 μl of vehicle or GGPP (final concentration, 11 μm) and incubated for 10 min before lysis. The cells were pelleted at 3500 rpm and resuspended in 200 μl of SUME with the following PIs: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 260 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 100 mm leupeptin hemisulfate, 76 mm pepstatin A, 5 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, 142 mm TPCK, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Glass lysis beads were added to meniscus. The tubes were vortexed six times for 1-min intervals with incubations on ice for 1 min in between. The liquid was removed from the beads and placed in a fresh tube. The beads were washed with 600 μl of IPB (15 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) with PIs and N-ethylmaleimide and combined with initial lysate. The lysis suspension was cleared of unbroken cells and large debris by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, to which 15 μl of anti-GFP was added. The immunoprecipitation was incubated for 5 min on ice and then subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and the immunoprecipitation was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated for an additional 2 h. The protein-bound beads were washed once with IPB and once with IPW (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The beads were aspirated to dryness, and the proteins were eluted with 55 μl of 2× USB. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After membrane autoclaving (16.Swerdlow P.S. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), ubiquitinated Hmg2p-GFP was detected with monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The levels of Hmg2p-GFP were detected with monoclonal anti-GFP. The microsomes were prepared from the strain expressing the MycL-Hmg2p-GFP for trypsin digestion as previously described (7.Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The microsomes were resuspended in XL buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KH2PO4/K2HPO4, final pH 7.5). Vehicle, farnesol (200 μm), or GGPP (20 μm) was added prior to incubation of 150 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 0, 2, and 10 min. An equal volume of 2× USB was added to stop the reactions. The samples were then separated by 14% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were detected with anti-Myc 9E-10 antibody. The assay was carried out as previously described (17.Garza R.M. Sato B.K. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14710-14722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the exception that microsome donor strains do not express HRD1 from the TDH3 promoter. Briefly, microsomes from a ubc7Δ null yeast strain expressing 3HA-Hrd1p from the HRD1 promoter and Hmg2p-GFP (WT or NR1) from the TDH3 promoter were prepared by glass bead lysis. 25 A600 units of log phase cells were lysed with 500 μl of membrane fractionation buffer (MF: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sorbitol) with same PIs as described under “In Vivo Ubiquitination.” At 4 °C, the cells were lysed using hand vortexing six times for 1-min intervals with 1-min intervals on ice between each vortexing. The lysate was collected and pooled with two bead rinses with MF to give the crude microsomal lysate and cleared of cellular debris. The microsomes were pelleted at 14,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in B88 buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 250 mm sorbitol, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with PIs to a final concentration of 0.3 optical density equivalent units/μl. Cytosol was prepared from a hrd1Δ ubc7Δ double null control strain and its overexpressing Ubc7p counterpart in a similar manner as the Schekman lab (18.Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 500 optical density equivalents of cells were pelleted, rinsed twice with water, rinsed once with B88 buffer, and resuspended in 500 μl of B88 buffer with PIs. The resuspended cells were transferred to a chilled mortar containing liquid nitrogen and ground with a pestle to form a frozen powder. 1 mm ATP from a 500 mm stock solution in H2O, pH 7, was added to thawed cytosol. This crude cytosol lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min to remove large debris, and then the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The lysate was further clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The cytosol concentrations were determined by Bradford reagent and adjusted with B88 to 20 mg/ml. MG-132 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 300 μm to microsome and cytosol preparations. One in vitro ubiquitination reaction consisted of 10 μl of microsomes and 12 μl of cytosol. ATP (500 mm stock) was added to each reaction to a final concentration of 30 mm. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The assay was stopped by solubilization with 200 μl of SUME with PIs and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. 600 μl of IPB with PIs and N-ethylmaleimide was added and followed by the addition of 15 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP. Immunoprecipitation, separation by SDS-PAGE, and detection of unmodified and ubiquitinated Hmg2p-GFP were carried out as described above under “In Vivo Ubiquitination.” Our earlier studies indicated that a molecule derived from FPP is the principle signal for HRD-dependent degradation of Hmg2p (5.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Those studies depended on the indirect production of the FPP-derived signal by genetic or pharmacological means. For example, the addition of the squalene synthase inhibitor ZA causes build-up of the FPP substrate of this enzyme, leading to strongly increased ubiquitination and degradation of Hmg2p. We explored whether the addition of various isoprenoids to yeast cell cultures could directly stimulate Hmg2p. We tested a variety of isoprene molecules formed along or from the sterol pathway including our original candidate molecule FPP, the 10-carbon precursor geranyl pyrophosphate, the two 5-carbon precursors dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate, and the 20-carbon GGPP, which is derived from FPP (Fig. 1). To facilitate our tests, we employed the normally regulated, noncatalytic reporter Hmg2p-GFP (5.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20.Gardner R.G. Shan H. Matsuda S.P. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8681-8694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), consisting of the eight-spanning N-terminal transmembrane anchor followed by GFP. Hmg2p-GFP undergoes normally regulated degradation that can be monitored biochemically or by in vivo flow cytometry of whole cell GFP. Log phase cells expressing Hmg2p-GFP were treated by direct addition of various test molecules to the culture medium for 1 h, followed by flow cytometry to evaluate changes in steady state levels caused by enhanced degradation. Of the molecules tested, GGPP alone had an effect on Hmg2p-GFP levels, and this effect was quite strong (Fig. 2A). In contrast, even very high concentrations of FPP did not affect Hmg2p-GFP levels (data not shown), despite its clear role as a precursor of the in vivo signal. Because GGPP is formed in vivo from FPP and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (Fig. 1), we also tested adding this pair in combination, but they similarly had no effect, and squalene, which lies downstream of FPP along the sterol pathway (Fig. 1) (5.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was also without effect, as expected (data not shown). This unique action of 20-carbon GGPP was reminiscent of stimulated degradation of mammalian HMGR caused by the direct addition of nonphosphorylated geranylgeraniol (GGOH) to cultured cells (8.Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a range of GGOH concentrations added to yeast cultures up to 50 times that of the lowest maximally effective GGPP concentration did not alter levels of Hmg2p-GFP (Fig. 2B). Although the 15-carbon alcohol FOH derived from FPP had strong effects in our in vitro structural assays (7.Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), FOH is highly toxic to yeast cells and thus could not be tested over the time scales normally used. However, short term studies of FOH in yeast indicate that this molecule was similarly without effect (data not shown). Thus, only GGPP had a direct effect on Hmg2p, and a striking one, prompting further investigation of this action. The concentration dependence of GGPP was determined (Fig. 2, C and D). Logarithmically growing cells were incubated with various concentrations of GGPP for 1 h, followed by flow cytometry of the cultures or immunoblotting of lysates prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In both assays, the approximate EC50 was 2 μm, and the lowest maximally effective concentration was ∼11 μm. Regulated degradation of Hmg2p proceeds by the HRD ER-associated degradation pathway, which employs the Hrd1p ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate Hmg2p (4.Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The effect of GGPP on Hmg2p-GFP similarly required an intact HRD pathway and was absent in a hrd1Δ null (Fig. 3A; compare HRD1 to hrd1Δ). Increasing the signal for Hmg2p degradation with agents such as ZA causes increased ubiquitination. The effect of GGPP on Hmg2p-GFP ubiquitination was evaluated by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for Hmg2p-GFP or ubiquitin. Identical cultures of cells were treated with GGPP, ZA, or their respective vehicles for just 10 min, followed by lysis and immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting analysis for ubiquitination. Like ZA, GGPP added directly to the yeast cells causes sudden and profound ubiquitination of Hmg2p-GFP (Fig. 3B). An extensive mutagenic analysis showed that lysines 6 and 357 of Hmg2p are each required for Hmg2p regulated degradation (21.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5994-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Loss of either lysine rendered GGPP ineffective in stimulating Hmg2p degradation (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the highly stable Hmg1p was not affected by GGPP (Fig. 4B). A number of distinct Hmg2p mutants undergo HRD-dependent degradation but are unregulated by the FPP-derived signal. That is, their HRD-dependent degradation is the same at all levels of the FPP-derived signal. We examined two of these mutants, NR1 and 6myc-Hmg2p, to further test the specificity of the GGPP effect. NR1-Hmg2p-GFP contains a five-amino acid change in the sterol sensing domain within the transmembrane domain of Hmg2p, and 6myc-Hmg2p-GFP has a segment of the lumenal transmembrane domain replaced with six Myc epitopes (7.Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Each of these proteins undergoes HRD-dependent degradation unaffected by changing the level of the FPP-derived signal. GGPP incubation did not influence NR1-Hmg2p-GFP or 6myc-Hmg2p-GFP levels in conditions where the wild type Hmg2p-GFP underwent the expected degradation (Fig. 5). Taken together, these in cis studies indicated that the effect of GGPP shows the same high specificity as the physiological signal derived from FPP. The squalene synthase inhibitor ZA induces Hmg2p degradation by causing FPP levels to build-up and acts very rapidly (5.Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). GGPP addition had a similar rapid effect on stability (Fig. 2E) and ubiquitination (Fig. 3B). Thus, it was important to test whether GGPP was also a potent inhibitor of squalene synthase or, alternatively, operated in a manner distinct from inhibition of this enzyme. Because ZA has a structure that is reminiscent of isoprenoids, this is a formal possibility. We tested this idea by several criteria convincingly demonstrating that GGPP acts directly on Hmg2p regulation rather than through squalene synthase inhibition. The effect of ZA is dependent on its inhibition of squalene synthase, encoded by the yeast ERG9 gene (Ref. 22.Bergstrom J.D. Kurtz M.M. Rew D.J. Amend A.M. Karkas J.D. Bostedor R.G. Bansal V.S.

Not surprisingly, overexpression of squalene synthase shifts the dose-response curve for ZA-induced stimulation of Hmg2p degradation strongly to the right. Specifically, we have shown that stimulation of Hm"
https://openalex.org/W2069142740,"Background Over the last decades, there has been an increasing interest on the chronology, distribution and mammal taxonomy (including hominins) related with the faunal turnovers that took place around the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition [ca. 1.8 mega-annum (Ma)] in Europe. However, these turnovers are not fully understood due to: the precarious nature of the period's fossil record; the “non-coexistence” in this record of many of the species involved; and the enormous geographical area encompassed. This palaeontological information gap can now be in part bridged with data from the Fonelas P-1 site (Granada, Spain), whose faunal composition and late Upper Pliocene date shed light on some of the problems concerning the timing and geography of the dispersals. Methodology/Principal Findings This rich fossil site yielded 32 species of mammals, among which autochthonous species of the European Upper Villafranchian coexist with canids (Canis), ovibovines (Praeovibos) and giraffids (Mitilanotherium) from Asia. Typical African species, such as the brown hyena (Hyaena brunnea) and the bush pig (Potamochoerus) are also present. Conclusions/Significance This assemblage is taxonomically and palaeobiogeographically unique, and suggests that fewer dispersal events than was previously thought (possibly only one close to 2.0 Ma) are responsible for the changes seen around 1.9–1.7 Ma ago in the fauna of the two continents."
https://openalex.org/W2011613113,"In vertebrates hearing is dependent upon the microvilli-like mechanosensory stereocilia and their length gradation. The staircase-like organization of the stereocilia bundle is dynamically maintained by variable actin turnover rates. Two unconventional myosins were previously implicated in stereocilia length regulation but the mechanisms of their action remain unknown. MyosinXVa is expressed in stereocilia tips at levels proportional to stereocilia length and its absence produces staircase-like bundles of very short stereocilia. MyosinVIIa localizes to the tips of the shorter stereocilia within bundles, and when absent, the stereocilia are abnormally long. We show here that myosinVIIa interacts with twinfilin-2, an actin binding protein, which inhibits actin polymerization at the barbed end of the filament, and that twinfilin localization in stereocilia overlaps with myosinVIIa. Exogenous expression of myosinVIIa in fibroblasts results in a reduced number of filopodia and promotes accumulation of twinfilin-2 at the filopodia tips. We hypothesize that the newly described interaction between myosinVIIa and twinfilin-2 is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of slower rates of actin turnover in shorter stereocilia, and that interplay between complexes of myosinVIIa/twinfilin-2 and myosinXVa/whirlin is responsible for stereocilia length gradation within the bundle staircase."

Overall M. tuberculosis complex culture positivity rates were 31.6% (787/2487) in MGIT and 27.1% (675/2487) in LJ (90.5% and 83.2% for smear-positive specimens). In total, 809 cultures of M. tuberculosis complex were isolated by any method. Median time to detection was 14 days for MGIT and 36 days for LJ (10 and 33 days for smear positive specimens) and indirect DST in MGIT took 9 days compared to 21 days on LJ. There was good concordance between DST on LJ and MGIT (96.8% for rifampin and 95.6% for isoniazid). Both molecular hybridization assay results correlated well with MGIT DST results, although molecular assays generally yielded higher rates of resistance (by approximately 3% for both isoniazid and rifampin).With effective planning and logistics, the MGIT 960 and molecular based methodologies can be successfully introduced into a reference laboratory setting in a middle incidence country. High rates of MDR TB in the Russian Federation make the introduction of such assays particularly useful."
https://openalex.org/W2003158081,"Glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressive agents that block upstream signaling events required for T cell receptor (TCR) activation. However, the mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit downstream responses, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-induced calcium signals, is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that low concentrations of dexamethasone rapidly convert transient calcium elevations to oscillations after strong TCR stimulation. Dexamethasone converted the pattern of calcium signaling by inhibiting the Src family kinase Lck, which was shown to interact with and positively regulate Type I IP(3) receptor. In addition, low concentrations of dexamethasone were sufficient to inhibit calcium oscillations and interleukin-2 mRNA after weak TCR stimulation. Together, these findings indicate that by inhibiting Lck and subsequently down-regulating IP(3) receptors, glucocorticoids suppress immune responses by weakening the strength of the TCR signal."
https://openalex.org/W2083775288,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) regulates numerous cellular functions and is critical for processes ranging from embryo development to cancer progression. Although autophosphorylation on Tyr-397 appears required for FAK functions in vitro, its role in vivo has not been established. We addressed this question using a mutant mouse (fakDelta) deleted of exon 15, which encodes Tyr-397. The resulting mutant protein FAKDelta is an active kinase expressed at normal levels. Our results demonstrate that the requirement for FAK autophosphorylation varies during development. FAK(Delta/Delta) embryos developed normally up to embryonic day (E) 12.5, contrasting with the lethality at E8.5 of FAK-null embryos. Thus, autophosphorylation on Tyr-397 is not required for FAK to achieve its functions until late mid-gestation. However, FAK(Delta/Delta) embryos displayed hemorrhages, edema, delayed artery formation, vascular remodeling defects, multiple organ abnormalities, and overall developmental retardation at E13.5-14.5, and died thereafter demonstrating that FAK autophosphorylation is also necessary for normal development. Fibroblasts derived from mutant embryos had a normal stellate morphology and expression of focal adhesion proteins, Src family members, p53, and Pyk2. In contrast, in FAK(Delta/Delta) fibroblasts and endothelial cells, spreading and lamellipodia formation were altered with an increased size and number of focal adhesions, enriched in FAKDelta. FAK mutation also decreased fibroblast proliferation. These results show that the physiological functions of FAK in vivo are achieved through both autophosphorylation-independent and autophosphorylation-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2086301620,"Midbrain dopaminergic axons project from the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to rostral target tissues, including the striatum, pallidum, and hypothalamus. The axons from the medially located VTA project primarily to more medial target tissues in the forebrain, whereas the more lateral SN axons project to lateral targets including the dorsolateral striatum. This structural diversity underlies the distinct functions of these pathways. Although a number of guidance cues have been implicated in the formation of the distinct axonal projections of the SN and VTA, the molecular basis of their diversity remains unclear. Here we investigate the molecular basis of structural diversity in mDN axonal projections. We find that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is expressed at a choice point in the course of the rostral dopaminergic projections. Furthermore, in midbrain explants, dopaminergic projections are attracted to a Shh source. Finally, in mice in which Shh signaling is inactivated during late neuronal development, the most medial dopaminergic projections are deficient. In addition to the role of Shh in the induction of mDN precursors, Shh plays an important role in dopaminergic axon pathfinding to rostral target tissues. Furthermore, Shh signaling is involved in determining the structural diversity of these dopaminergic projections."

IntroductionThe ability of antibodies to bind to an almost unlimited number of target proteins with high specificity makes them one of the fastest growing classes of therapeutics in the biological drugs market (1.Pavlou A.K. Belsey M.J. Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 2005; 59: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since the first description of monoclonal antibodies (2.Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12581) Google Scholar), dramatic progress has been made in the expression, engineering, humanization, and applications of antibodies as therapeutics. A wide variety of antibody fragments have been evaluated as potential therapeutics including the well characterized antigen binding fragment (Fab), which contains the light chain (VL and CL domains) and N-terminal portion of the heavy chain (VH and CH domains). The smallest fragment to retain full binding activity has also attracted considerable interest, with the so-called single chain variable fragment (scFv) 3The abbreviations used are: scFvsingle chain variable fragmentIL-1βinterleukin-1βRDCresidual dipolar couplingCDRcomplementarity-determining regionr.m.s.d.root mean squared deviationNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYNOE spectroscopyTROSYtransverse relaxation optimized spectroscopyHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlation.

Currently, identification of the binding sites for antibodies on target proteins is achieved via one or a combination of indirect methods such as protease protection, peptide scanning, site-directed mutagenesis, or analysis of backbone amide exchange (4.Lane D.P.

Although providing valuable information, each of these approaches has drawbacks; in particular, they may not detect discontinuous epitopes and do not provide information on the spatial organization of epitopes. For such an important area of biotherapeutics, relatively few crystal structures have been determined for potential therapeutic antibody-target protein complexes, which probably reflects the inherent flexibility and solubility of antibodies, resulting in limited success in crystallization trials.Continued developments in NMR spectroscopy mean that it is now possible to obtain detailed structural information for proteins and complexes of up to 80 kDa in solution (7.Kanelis V. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which makes this an attractive approach for determining the structures of isolated scFvs (28 kDa) and Fabs (50 kDa), as well as complexes formed with target proteins. NMR spectroscopy is an ideal tool for mapping the precise interaction sites on both the antibodies and also target proteins. To date, only a few limited NMR studies of functional antibody fragments have been reported, including scFv, Fv, and isolated VL domains (8.Freund C. Ross A. Guth B. Plückthun A. Holak T.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9.Freund C. Ross A. Plückthun A. Holak T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3296-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with broad line widths limiting the experiments possible. In the case of scFvs, the formation of domain-swapped dimers at even relatively low concentrations is now well documented (10.Desplancq D. King D.J. Lawson A.D. Mountain A. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11.Lee Y.C. Boehm M.K. Chester K.A. Begent R.H. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and presumably accounts for the line width problems encountered in previous attempts to obtain detailed structural information for scFvs using NMR-based methods.In this study, we report the successful use of NMR spectroscopy to determine a reliable model for the scFv-IL-1β complex, which reveals details of the scFv residues involved in IL-1β recognition, as well as the binding site on IL-1β. We also provide direct evidence that a scFv binds to a target protein in the same manner as an equivalent Fab, indicating that high resolution models for scFv-target protein complexes can be used as reliable guides for the rational design and development of therapeutic antibodies.DISCUSSIONThe work reported here clearly demonstrates that an NMR restraint-driven docking approach can be successfully used to determine a reliable and informative model for the structure of a scFv-target protein complex. One limitation of the approach described is the lack of direct experimental data to define the conformations of amino acid side chains in scFv-target protein interfaces, which in the model reported here are simply a best computational solution to optimize the interactions of side chains involved in the interface. The precise scFv-IL-1β interactions involving side chains should therefore be viewed as reasonable possibilities, rather than confirmed interactions, but provide a good basis for the assessment of potentially key interactions by further experimental work, such as site-directed mutagenesis. Detailed analysis of the scFv-IL-1β interface and comparison with other antibody-antigen structures are summarized in Table 1 and supplemental Table 2. The nature of the interface, in particular the high content of aromatic and non-polar residues and the size of the buried surface area, are consistent with a representative sample of previously reported antibody-target protein complexes (35.Aÿ J.

In the scFv-IL-1β complex, 18 of the scFv residues make contacts with IL-1β and are distributed equally between the variable heavy and light domains, as summarized in Table 1. Residues in CDRs L1 and H2 make the most interactions with IL-1β with CDRs L2 and H1 playing no role in binding. Interestingly, of the eight representative antibody complexes selected for comparison from the Protein Data Bank (43.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26649) Google Scholar), three (2GHW, 1LK3, and 1DZB) had interactions with the target protein involving framework residues as well as CDR loops (defined using the International ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system (44.Lefranc M.P. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)). This feature is also seen in the scFv-IL-1β structure reported here, with 3 scFv framework residues contacting IL-1β (Table 1). A comparison of the interface characteristics of antibodies selected as therapeutics with ones not selected specifically for this purpose (supplemental Table 3) reveals no obvious differences in the size of the contact surface, the types of interactions, or the locations of residues involved in interactions.The strikingly similar spectra seen for IL-1β bound to equivalent scFv and Fab antibody fragments (Fig. 6) provide direct evidence that scFvs bind target proteins in an essentially identical manner to Fabs, which makes scFv-target protein complexes an attractive target for structural studies directed at a knowledge-based approach to rational design and humanization of antibodies. In addition to scFvs and Fabs targeted at IL-1β, we have obtained equivalent quality NMR data for complexes formed with a number of secreted proteins, including sclerostin (45.Veverka V. Henry A.J. Slocombe P.M. Ventom A. Mulloy B. Muskett F.W. Muzylak M. Greenslade K. Moore A. Zhang L. Gong J. Qian X. Paszty C. Taylor R.J. Robinson M.K. Carr M.D. J. Biol.

This strongly suggests that NMR spectroscopy will provide a reliable and fairly widely applicable approach for determining high resolution models of the structures of scFv-target protein complexes, which has the potential to have a major impact on the rational design, optimization, and humanization of therapeutic antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2030806868,"Background We have previously described fundamental differences in the biology of stem cells as compared to other dividing cell populations. We reasoned therefore that a differential screen using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds may identify either selective survival factors or specific toxins and may be useful for the therapeutically-driven manufacturing of cells in vitro and possibly in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we report on optimized methods for feeder-free culture of hESCs and hESC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) to facilitate automated screening. We show that we are able to measure ATP as an indicator of metabolic activity in an automated screening assay. With this optimized platform we screened a collection of FDA-approved drugs to identify compounds that have differential toxicity to hESCs and their neural derivatives. Nine compounds were identified to be specifically toxic for NSCs to a greater extent than for hESCs. Six of these initial hits were retested and verified by large-scale cell culture to determine dose-responsive NSC toxicity. One of the compounds retested, amiodarone HCL, was further tested for possible effects on postmitotic neurons, a likely target for transplant therapy. Amiodarone HCL was found to be selectively toxic to NSCs but not to differentiated neurons or glial cells. Treated and untreated NSCs and neurons were then interrogated with global gene expression analysis to explore the mechanisms of action of amiodarone HCl. The gene expression analysis suggests that activation of cell-type specific cationic channels may underlie the toxicity of the drug. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, we have developed a screening strategy that allows us to rapidly identify clinically approved drugs for use in a Chemistry, Manufacture and Control protocol that can be safely used to deplete unwanted contaminating precursor cells from a differentiated cell product. Our results also suggest that such a strategy is rich in the potential of identifying lineage specific reagents and provides additional evidence for the utility of stem cells in screening and discovery paradigms."

Mn(++) was previously found to stimulate the endonuclease activity of these homologues. ATP was required for the nicking activity of hPMS2 and yPMS1, but was reported to inhibit bacterial MutL proteins from Thermus thermophilus and Aquifex aeolicus that displayed homology to hPMS2. Mutational analysis has identified the DQHA(X)(2)E(X)(4)E motif present in the C-terminus of PMS2 homologues as important for endonuclease activity.We examined the effect ATP had on the Mn(++) induced nicking of supercoiled pBR322 by full-length and mutant A. aeolicus MutL (Aae MutL) proteins. Assays were single time point, enzyme titration experiments or reaction time courses. The maximum velocity for MutL nicking was determined to be 1.6+/-0.08x10(-5) s(-1) and 4.2+/-0.3x10(-5) s(-1) in the absence and presence of ATP, respectively. AMPPNP stimulated the nicking activity to a similar extent as ATP. A truncated Aae MutL protein composed of only the C-terminal 123 amino acid residues was found to nick supercoiled DNA. Furthermore, mutations in the conserved C-terminal DQHA(X)(2)E(X)(4)E and CPHGRP motifs were shown to abolish Aae MutL endonuclease activity.ATP stimulated the Mn(++) induced endonuclease activity of Aae MutL. Experiments utilizing AMPPNP implied that the stimulation did not require ATP hydrolysis. A mutation in the DQHA(X)(2)E(X)(4)E motif of Aae MutL further supported the role of this region in endonclease activity. For the first time, to our knowledge, we demonstrate that changing the histidine residue in the conserved CPHGRP motif abolishes endonucleolytic activity of a hPMS2 homologue. Finally, the C-terminal 123 amino acid residues of Aae MutL were sufficient to display Mn(++) induced nicking activity."
https://openalex.org/W1606858778,"The GTP-binding protein Ras plays a central role in the regulation of various cellular processes, acting as a molecular switch that triggers signaling cascades.

We challenged the Ras·Raf complex in this study because Raf among all effectors shows the highest Ras affinity and the fastest association kinetics. The proposed mutations were characterized as to their changes in dynamics and binding strength. We demonstrate that Ras-Raf interaction can only be improved at the cost of a loss in specificity of Ras·GTP versus Ras·GDP.

https://openalex.org/W2061824367,"Background Biological processes typically involve the interactions of a number of elements (genes, cells) acting on each others. Such processes are often modelled as networks whose nodes are the elements in question and edges pairwise relations between them (transcription, inhibition). But more often than not, elements actually work cooperatively or competitively to achieve a task. Or an element can act on the interaction between two others, as in the case of an enzyme controlling a reaction rate. We call “complex” these types of interaction and propose ways to identify them from time-series observations. Methodology We use Granger Causality, a measure of the interaction between two signals, to characterize the influence of an enzyme on a reaction rate. We extend its traditional formulation to the case of multi-dimensional signals in order to capture group interactions, and not only element interactions. Our method is extensively tested on simulated data and applied to three biological datasets: microarray data of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, local field potential recordings of two brain areas and a metabolic reaction. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that complex Granger causality can reveal new types of relation between signals and is particularly suited to biological data. Our approach raises some fundamental issues of the systems biology approach since finding all complex causalities (interactions) is an NP hard problem."

The structures reveal that HCS forms an intertwined homodimer stabilized by domain-swapping between the N- and C-terminal domains of each monomer. The N-terminal catalytic domain is composed of a TIM barrel fold in which 2-OG binds via hydrogen bonds and coordination to the active site divalent metal ion, whereas the C-terminal domain is composed of mixed α/β topology. In the structures of the HCS apoenzyme and one of the 2-OG binary complexes, a lid motif from the C-terminal domain occludes the entrance to the active site of the neighboring monomer, whereas in the second 2-OG complex the lid is disordered, suggesting that it regulates substrate access to the active site through its apparent flexibility. Mutations of the active site residues involved in 2-OG binding or implicated in acid-base catalysis impair or abolish activity in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, we found that ERK1/2 phosphorylates mouse myocardin (isoform B) at four sites (Ser(812), Ser(859), Ser(866), and Thr(893)), all of which are located within the transactivation domain of myocardin. The single mutation of each site either to alanine or to aspartate has no effect on the ability of myocardin to activate SRF. However, the phosphomimetic mutation of all four sites to aspartate (4xD) significantly impairs activation of SRF by myocardin, whereas the phosphodeficient mutation of all four sites to alanine (4xA) has no effect. This translates to a reduced ability of the 4xD (but not of 4xA) mutant of myocardin to stimulate expression of SM alpha-actin and SM22, as assessed by corresponding promoter, mRNA, or protein assays. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of myocardin at these sites impairs its interaction with acetyltransferase, cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein, which is known to promote the transcriptional activity of myocardin. In conclusion, we describe a novel mode of modulation of SM gene transcription by ERK1/2 through a direct phosphorylation of myocardin."

A-site mRNA cleavage is thought to facilitate transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA).SmpB- mediated recycling of stalled ribosome complexes. Here, we demonstrate that the aminoglycosides paromomycin and streptomycin inhibit A-site cleavage of stop codons during inefficient translation termination. Aminoglycosides also induced stop codon read-through, suggesting that these antibiotics alleviate ribosome pausing during termination. Streptomycin did not inhibit A-site cleavage in rpsL mutants, which express streptomycin-resistant variants of ribosomal protein S12. However, rpsL strains exhibited reduced A-site mRNA cleavage compared with rpsL(+) cells. Additionally, tmRNA.SmpB-mediated SsrA peptide tagging was significantly reduced in several rpsL strains but could be fully restored in a subset of mutants when treated with streptomycin. The streptomycin-dependent rpsL(P90K) mutant also showed significantly lower levels of A-site cleavage and tmRNA.SmpB activity. Mutations in rpsD (encoding ribosomal protein S4), which suppressed streptomycin dependence, were able to partially restore A-site cleavage to rpsL(P90K) cells but failed to increase tmRNA.SmpB activity. Taken together, these results show that perturbations to A-site structure and function modulate A-site mRNA cleavage and tmRNA.SmpB activity. We propose that tmRNA.SmpB binds to streptomycin-resistant rpsL ribosomes less efficiently, leading to a partial loss of ribosome rescue function in these mutants."

ATRX encodes a chromatin remodeling protein, however the role of ATRX in skeletal development is currently unknown.We induced Atrx deletion in mouse cartilage using the Cre-loxP system, with Cre expression driven by the collagen II (Col2a1) promoter. Growth rate, body size and weight, and long bone length did not differ in Atrx(Col2cre) mice compared to control littermates. Histological analyses of the growth plate did not reveal any differences between control and mutant mice. Expression patterns of Sox9, a transcription factor required for cartilage morphogenesis, and p57, a marker of cell cycle arrest and hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, was unaffected. However, loss of ATRX in cartilage led to a delay in the ossification of the hips in some mice. We also observed hindlimb polydactily in one out of 61 mutants.These findings indicate that ATRX is not directly required for development or growth of cartilage in the mouse, suggesting that the short stature in ATR-X patients is caused by defects in cartilage-extrinsic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2115689895,"Microfilaments play a determinant role in different cell processes such as: motility, cell division, phagocytosis and intracellular transport; however, these structures are poorly understood in the parasite Giardia lamblia.By confocal microscopy using TRITC-phalloidin, we found structured actin distributed in the entire trophozoite, the label stand out at the ventral disc, median body, flagella and around the nuclei. During Giardia encystation, a sequence of morphological changes concurrent to modifications on the distribution of structured actin and in the expression of actin mRNA were observed. To elucidate whether actin participates actively on growth and encystation, cells were treated with Cytochalasin D, Latrunculin A and Jasplakinolide and analyzed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. All drugs caused a growth reduction (27 to 45%) and changes on the distribution of actin. Besides, 60 to 80% of trophozoites treated with the drugs, exhibited damage at the caudal region, alterations in the flagella and wrinkles-like on the plasma membrane. The drugs also altered the cyst-yield and the morphology, scanning electron microscopy revealed diminished cytokinesis, cysts with damages in the wall and alterations in the size and on the intermembranal space. Furthermore, the drugs caused a significant reduction of the intensity of fluorescence-labeled CWP1 on ESV and on cyst wall, this was coincident with a reduction of CWP1 gene expression (34%).All our results, indicated an important role of actin in the morphology, growth and encystation and indirectly suggested an actin role in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2029903159,"Previously, we have shown that statistical synergism between amino acid variants in thyroglobulin (Tg) and specific HLA-DR3 pocket sequence signatures conferred a high risk for autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Therefore, we hypothesized that this statistical synergism mirrors a biochemical interaction between Tg peptides and HLA-DR3, which is key to the pathoetiology of AITD. To test this hypothesis, we designed a recombinant HLA-DR3 expression system that was used to express HLA-DR molecules harboring either AITD susceptibility or resistance DR pocket sequences. Next, we biochemically generated the potential Tg peptidic repertoire available to HLA-DR3 by separately treating 20 purified human thyroglobulin samples with cathepsins B, D, or L, lysosomal proteases that are involved in antigen processing and thyroid biology. Sequences of the cathepsin-generated peptides were then determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectroscopy, and algorithmic means were employed to identify putative AITD-susceptible HLA-DR3 binders. From four predicted peptides, we identified two novel peptides that bound strongly and specifically to both recombinant AITD-susceptible HLA-DR3 protein and HLA-DR3 molecules expressed on stably transfected cells. Intriguingly, the HLA-DR3-binding peptides we identified had a marked preference for the AITD-susceptibility DR signatures and not to those signatures that were AITD-protective.

II molecule is intimately associated with the initiation of autoimmunity. Studies in several MHC II-associated autoimmune conditions, most notably type 1 diabetes, have now convincingly demonstrated that susceptibility to disease is caused by certain structural features of the MHC II peptide binding cleft that influence the display of immunogenic peptides (1.Wucherpfennig K.W.

Similarly, we have shown that the autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), Graves disease (GD) and Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), are strongly associated with unique HLA-DR peptide binding cleft sequences (6.Ban Y. Davies T.F. Greenberg D.A. Concepcion E.S. Osman R. Oashi T. Tomer Y. Genes Immun. 2004; 5: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30.Menconi F. Monti M.C. Greenberg D.A. Oashi T.

Mechanistically, these pocket amino acid signatures could accommodate autoantigenic peptides derived from any of the thyroid-specific proteins, namely thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid peroxidase, and thyrotropin receptor. Indeed, there exist data demonstrating that thyroglobulin, which constitutes 80% (8.Shulman S. Adv. Immunol. 1971; 14: 85-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of total thyroidal protein, is an important thyroidal target and participant in triggering AITD (reviewed in Ref. 9.Jacobson E.M. Tomer Y. Thyroid. 2007; 17: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Along a similar vein of thought, there is mounting evidence that suggests a role for polymorphisms in the thyrotropin receptor, the specific target of Graves disease, in the initiation of Graves hyperthyroidism (28.Brand O.J.

For the case of thyroid autoimmunity, the connection between MHC II susceptibility signatures and how they influence autoantigenic peptide binding is gradually becoming unveiled. Work from our own group has shown that a single amino acid variation in the HLA-DR3 peptide binding cleft, resulting in an arginine at position 74 of the β chain (DRβ-Arg-74), was strongly associated with GD (6.Ban Y. Davies T.F. Greenberg D.A. Concepcion E.S. Osman R. Oashi T. Tomer Y. Genes Immun. 2004; 5: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, upon co-inheriting DRβ-Arg-74 and a disease-associated Tg SNP (R1999W), the risk of developing GD was elevated significantly beyond the additive effect of these two variants, resulting in an odds ratio of 15 (7.Hodge S.E.

Thyroid. 2006; 16: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) Thus, we hypothesized that this statistical interaction mirrors an in vivo biochemical interaction between thyroglobulin peptides and the disease-associated pocket signature of HLA-DR3. Given the potential importance of Tg/HLA-DR3 interactions, factors that could influence the generation of Tg-derived peptides, and/or the binding of a given thyroglobulin peptide to HLA-DRβ-Arg-74, would be expected to be strongly linked to the etiology of AITD. For example, cathepsins B, D, and L, endosomal proteases involved in antigen processing (11.Rodriguez G.M. Diment S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2894-2898PubMed Google Scholar), are also key enzymes in Tg degradation (12.Dunn A.D. Crutchfield H.E. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thyroid biology (13.Shuja S. Cai J. Iacobuzio-Donahue C. Zacks J. Beazley R.M. Kasznica J.M. O'Hara C.J. Heimann R.

Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), potentially making them major determinants of the Tg peptidic repertoire (15.Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to extrinsic factors such as proteases, factors that are intrinsic to Tg, such as polymorphisms, could, by virtue of the induction of either a change in conformation or a change in the proteolytic cleavage site, render a given region more or less sensitive to digestion and thus alter the pool of bio-available peptides (reviewed in Ref, 16.Engelhard V.H. Altrich-Vanlith M. Ostankovitch M. Zarling A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The goals of this study were to examine, at both a biochemical and structural level, the features of the HLA-DR susceptibility and resistance variants that influence Tg peptide binding. Toward achieving this end, we have designed an Escherichia coli-based system that enabled us to make functional versions of “empty” HLA-DR3. Furthermore, we have used these recombinant MHC II molecules to examine binding to selected peptides from a putative bioavailable Tg peptide pool, as well as to two Tg-derived peptides that were previously reported to bind to HLA-DR3 (17.Muixí L. Carrascal M. Alvarez I. Daura X. Martí M. Armengol M.P. Pinilla C. Abian J. Pujol-Borrell R. Jaraquemada D. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we present data that shed insights on how susceptibility and resistance signatures of the HLA-DR peptide binding pocket influence the selection of the Tg peptides that can be presented to autoreactive T-cells in the initiation of AITD. The protocol was approved by the University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board for obtaining de-identified tissues. Twenty thyroid samples were obtained either from healthy portions of glands removed at surgery or from thyroids taken at autopsy (total death time ≤16 h) that were purchased from the NCBI Brain and Tissue Bank at the University of Maryland. Thyroid tissue samples were subsequently stored at −80 °C until use. Each thyroid tissue (typically 0.2–0.6 g) was thawed and resuspended in a 10-fold volume/tissue weight in 20 mm disodium hydrogen phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0, in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, caproic acid (added 25 μl per 25 ml of buffer), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (catalogue number 04 693 116 001, Roche Applied Science; 1 tablet added per 25 ml of buffer) The sample was treated in a Dounce homogenizer, and protein was precipitated, via the addition of 0.4 g/ml ammonium sulfate. Precipitate was next resuspended in 10–20 ml of resuspension buffer. Dialysis followed, using a membrane with 15,000 molecular weight cutoff against 3 liters of 20 mm disodium hydrogen phosphate, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.0. The sample was filtered, using 0.22-μm membranes, and was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion column. The thyroglobulin-containing portion, which came off in the void volume, was then applied to an anion exchange column (Anx-Sepharose 4 fast flow, catalogue number 17-1287-10, GE Healthcare) and was run at 2 ml/min, using a linear gradient from 50 to 600 mm KCl. Thyroglobulin eluted in a broad peak, spanning 200–600 mm KCl. Fractions were pooled and were subsequently concentrated to 1 ml, using a filter (Pierce) with a 20,000 molecular weight cutoff. The concentrate was diluted 1:20 in the final buffer (10 mm phosphate, 25 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0) and was then concentrated to 1–10 mg/ml protein, as determined using a protein assay dye reagent kit (Bio-Rad). Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and were subsequently stored at −80 °C. DNA was extracted from a small section of each thyroid tissue, using the Puregene kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer's protocol. SNPs, identified within the Tg gene, were analyzed by a fluorescent-based restriction fragment length polymorphism method, as described previously (18.Tomer Y. Greenberg D.A. Barbesino G. Concepcion E. Davies T.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1687-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cathepsins B, D, and L were used separately to digest Tg. Digestions were performed as follows: to 40 μg of human Tg (in 33 μl of 10% glycerol, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl), 1.875 μl of 1 m citrate, pH 3.5, 0.375 μl of 1 m MgCl2, 37.15 μl of distilled H2O, and 2.6 μl of cathepsin (resuspended in 500 mm citrate, pH 3.5, 50% glycerol)) were added. The final cathepsin activity was 0.085 units/μl for cathepsins B and D and 0.003 units/μl for cathepsin L. Cathepsins B (Sigma) and D (Sigma) were purified from human liver, whereas cathepsin L (Cal Biochem) was derived from a human cDNA, expressed recombinantly. Digestions were performed at 37 °C for 16–20 h. Separation of the digested Tg protein on an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel versus undigested control verified that the digestion into constituent peptides was nearly complete. Peptides profiles of cathepsin-digested thyroglobulins were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectroscopy. Desaltation on target was used to eliminate peptide loss during peptide preparation for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as matrix and prepared as a saturated solution in a 1:4:4 (v/v) mixture of formic acid/water/isopropyl alcohol. A small aliquot (1 μl) of mixture of peptide/matrix (1:1) was spotted onto the sample plate. As soon as crystals were formed, the excess liquid was removed by vacuum aspiration. The spot was then washed twice for a few seconds with 2 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. All spectra were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in linear and reflector mode. The spectra were smoothed, calibrated, and analyzed using the program M-over-Z. Peptide sequences were acquired on a nanoflow liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry instrument. The nano-LC system included a Micro-Tech XtremeSimple nano-LC pump system (Vista, CA) and a Shimadzu SIL-20AC AutoSampler (Kyoto, Japan). Peptides were separated on a reversed-phase C-18 column (100 μm (inner diameter) × 15 cm, 3 μm, 300 Å) (Micro-Tech, CA) by linear gradient elution of 3–50% solvent B in 60 min, using solvent A containing 98% water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; and solvent B containing 98% acetonitrile, 2% water, 0.1% formic acid at flow rate of 600 nl/min. LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo-Fisher, MA) was used to collect mass data, and the instrument was operated in the data-dependent mode. Survey MS spectra (from m/z 300 to 1600) were acquired in the Orbitrap with resolution R = 30,000 at m/z = 400. The five most intense ions were isolated and fragmented in a linear ion trap. The resulting fragment ions were recorded in the Orbitrap with resolution R = 15,000 at m/z = 400 or in the linear ion trap. Peptides were identified via automated data base searching by Sorcerer (version 3.10.7) (Sage-N) against an in-house created human thyroglobulin protein sequence data base composed of all entries of human thyroglobulin protein from the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) data base and our own thyroglobulin protein sequence containing SNP information. No digestion was selected during the creation of the search data base from the Fasta files. Mass tolerances on MS peaks were 5 ppm and on tandem MS peaks were 0.5 Da. Scaffold 2.0 was used to open the search result files. Only peptides with an XCorr value from SEQUEST searching software above the following settings, Sequest XCorr >1.8, 1+; >2.0, 2+; >2.2, 3+; >2.5, 4+ and above, or an E value from X!Tandem searching software above 2 were accepted for identification. The peptide profiles, analyzed by MS, were correlated with the Tg SNP genotypes. Across the different mass spectra, a representative peak was taken as an internal standard. The heights of all other peaks in the spectrum were normalized with respect to the internal standard peak. Normalized peak heights were then examined for correlation with the Tg genotype for three Tg SNPs that were shown to be associated with AITD (E10SNP24 (S734A or rs180223), E12SNP (M1027V or rs853326), and E33 SNP (R1999W or rs11535853)) (10.Ban Y.

Peptides (>95% purity) were ordered commercially either from AlphaDiagnostic International (San Antonio, TX) or GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). Peptides were synthesized with biotin, at their N termini, to facilitate subsequent detection. Oligos were purchased from either Sigma-Proligo (The Woodlands, TX) or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Frozen thyroid tissues (a total of six samples) were resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS with 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors) at 2.5× the volume of tissue sample. Samples were vortexed 3–4 times in 5-s bursts and were kept on ice for 30 min with vortexing every 10 min. Samples were subsequently spun down for 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and boiled for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined using a protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad) against the standard curve constructed with increasing amounts of bovine serum albumin (Bio-Rad). 10 μg of each sample were loaded onto an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. Before loading, samples were heated at 95 °C for 2–3 min in sample buffer under reduced conditions. Size standards consisted of pre-stained protein markers from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Contents of the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After transfer, membranes were blocked, for 30 min, in 5% milk TBST. Primary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution, in 2.5% milk TBST, and incubated overnight. After washing, the membrane was exposed to a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 45 min. Signal was detected using the chemiluminescent system from Amersham Biosciences. Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonals against cathepsin D (Cell Signaling), cathepsin B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), cathepsin L (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and β-actin (Sigma). The secondary antibody consisted of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce). Signal was visualized with the ECL system (GE Healthcare) and exposure to x-ray film. The cDNAs for the α (DRA*010202) and β chains (DRB1*030101) of HLA-DR3 were generously provided by Dr. N. Koch (University of Bonn) and by Dr. C. Katovich-Hurley (Georgetown University). Sequencing of the β chain confirmed the presence of arginine at position β74. Individual amino acids of the peptide binding cleft at the β chain were changed, as indicated under “Results,” using the QuickChange® II or QuickChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, catalogue number 200523 and 200515), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridoma cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Clone HB-55 was used to make the monoclonal antibody L243, which specifically recognizes the DRα chain when it is correctly folded and complexed with its β chain complement (free α chains do not bind L243) (19.Fu X.T. Karr R.W. Hum. Immunol. 1994; 39: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were grown in serum-free media (Thermo Scientific). Prior to use in experiments, IgG molecules were purified from the spent media, using protein G conjugated to agarose (Roche Applied Science). Concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm (1 A280 nm unit = 0.8 mg/ml immunoglobulin). Cell lines used in this study either expressed MHC II molecules endogenously or were stably transfected to express MHC II. VAVY cells (expressing HLA-DR3 B1*0301, DRA 0102, DQA0501, DQB10201, DPA10201, and DPB10101) were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Rat2 cells, derived from rat embryonic kidney tissue, were purchased from the ATCC and were subsequently engineered to express HLA-DR3. Despite the absence of invariant chain and endogenous MHC II molecules, Rat2 fibroblast cells are fully capable of assembling functional MHC class II proteins (20.Hitzel C. van Endert P. Koch N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1048-1056PubMed Google Scholar). Rat2 cells stably transfected with HLA-DR3 were made as follows. The cDNA of the α chain was subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pCDNA 3.1+ vector (Invitrogen), containing the hygromycin resistance gene, and the cDNA of the β chain was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pCDNA 3.1+ vector containing the neomycin resistance gene. Cells were co-transfected with a total of 0.5 μg of the DRα and DRβ chain cDNA constructs, using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen), and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with high glucose, 10 mm l-glutamine, pyridoxine-HCl, 300 μg/ml neomycin, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin for selection of double-positive clones (DRα and DRβ). After several passages, cells were analyzed for DR expression using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter and using the HLA-DR-specific monoclonal antibody, L243. Positive cells were sorted and expanded. Biotinylated peptides were tested for binding to Rat2 cells expressing recombinant HLA-DR, based on methodology reported previously (21.Posch P.E. Araujo H.A. Creswell K. Praud C. Johnson A.H. Hurley C.K. Hum. Immunol. 1995; 42: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin D (Pierce) was used to detect the N-terminal biotinylated peptide. Amplification of the signal was achieved by incubating with 5 μg/ml biotinylated avidin-D-specific antisera (Pierce). Control samples consisted of Rat2 cells not transfected with HLA-DR, as well as HLA-DR expressing Rat2 cells incubated without peptide. Phycoerythrin-conjugated L243 (BD Biosciences) was used to detect the presence of HLA-DR molecules on the cell surface. The isotype control consisted of phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse IgG2a, κ isotype control (BD Biosciences). For all flow cytometry experiments, binding was measured on a Coulter Epics XL (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). Dead cells and debris were excluded from analysis by setting the appropriate threshold trigger on forward-angle light scatter. Log fluorescence was collected for fluorescein isothiocyanate using a 525 band pass filter and phycoerythrin using a 575 band pass filter. In all experiments, 10,000 gated events were collected. For data analysis, peptide binding was expressed as the number of cells that bound peptide/the number of HLA-DR3 expressing cells. Fully processed and naturally occurring HLA-DR3 molecules were purified from the VAVY cell line based on the reported protocols (22.Shackelford D.A. Lampson L.A. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 289-296PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Gorga J.C. Horejsí V. Johnson D.R. Raghupathy R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16087-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 109 cells were lysed for 60 min at 4 °C in 0.01 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 2% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitors. HLA-DR3 molecules were purified from clarified cell lysates by immunoaffinity chromatography using L243, which was covalently linked to protein A-agarose, using the protein A IgG orientation kit (Thermo Scientific). Protein content was evaluated by the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. We have used a method successfully employed for HLA-DR expression systems in SF9 cells. Briefly, to achieve heterodimer stability (23.Gauthier L. Smith K.J. Pyrdol J. Kalandadze A. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Wucherpfennig K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11828-11833Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in the absence of a transmembrane domain, the extracellular portion of the DRB1*0301 β chain was fused to the coiled-coiled region of the basic leucine zipper domain of JunB, whereas the extracellular portion of the α chain was fused to the coiled-coiled region of the basic leucine zipper omain of Fos. These dimerization motifs have been demonstrated to preferentially favor the creation of heterodimers versus homodimers (24.Deng T. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Empty HLA-DR3 molecules were constructed by expressing each DR chain separately in E. coli and then refolding them together. Expression and purification were based on previous reports (25.Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26.Stöckel J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29571-29578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). “Sticky end” PCR was employed to fuse the respective α or β ectodomain with its respective dimerization motif. 100 nanograms of the XhoI-linearized pcDNA3.1 construct containing the α chain was used as a template with forward primer (5′-TGCCCTCGAGAAAAGAATCAAAGAAGAACATGTGATC-3′, XhoI site is in boldface) and reverse primer (5′-TCCTCCTCCGTCGACTCCCTGAAAGTACAGGTTCTCGTTCTCTGTAGTCTCTGGGAG-3′; SalI site is in boldface, and TEV protease cleavage site is underlined). The cDNA clone containing the FOS dimerization domain was purchased from the ATCC (clone number MGC-11074). PCR was performed, using the cDNA clone as a template, along with forward primer (5′-GGAGTCGACGGAGGAGGACTGACTGATACACTCCAAGCG-3′; SalI site is in boldface) and reverse primer (5′-GCGGTTAATTAATCATGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATATCGGTGAGCTGCCAGGATGAA-3′; PacI site is in boldface; stop codon is underlined, and hemagglutinin epitope tag is italicized). The amplicons of the DRα ectodomain and the FOS dimerization domain were joined together by sticky end PCR, and the amplicon was then subcloned into the XhoI/PacI sites of pKLAC1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). For construction of the β chain construct, 100 ng of XhoI-linearized pcDNA3.1 containing the DRβ construct were used as a template with forward primer (5′-CTGCCCTCGAGAAAAGAGGGGACACCAGACCACGTTTC-3′; XhoI site is in boldface) and reverse primer (5-TCCTCCTCCGTCGACTCCCTGAAAGTACAGGTTCATCTTGCTCTGTGCAGATTC-3′; SalI site is in boldface, and TEV protease cleavage site is underlined). The cDNA clone containing the junB dimerization domain was purchased from OriGene (catalogue number TC118763, Rockville, MD) and was used as a template with forward primer (5′-GGAGTCGACGGAGGAGGACGCATCGCGCGCCTGGAGGAC-3′; SalI site is in boldface) and 250 nm reverse primer (5′-GCGGTTAATTAATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTTCATGACTTTCTGCTT-3′; PacI site is in boldface; the stop codon is italicized, and the histidine tag is underlined). As with the case of the DRα construct, the amplicons of the DRβ ectodomain and the JunB dimerization domain were joined together by sticky end PCR. The amplicon was then subcloned into the XhoI/PacI sites of pKLAC1. For expression in E. coli, each individual MHC II fusion chain was subcloned and expressed individually in the pET25b(+) vector (Novagen). In brief, the respective constructs that had been subcloned into the pKLAC1 plasmid were used as templates for PCR, using the following primers: forward (5′-CCTGCCCATATGATCAAAGAAGAACATGTGATC-3′; NdeI site is in boldface) and reverse (5′-GCCTTGCTCAGCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTCGGTGAGCTGCCAGGAT-3′; BlpI site is in boldface) and forward (5′-CCTGCCCATATGGGGGACACCAGACCACGTTTC-3′; NdeI site is in boldface) and reverse primer (5′-GGAGGCCTCGAGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTT-3′; XhoI site is in boldface), for the α and β fusions, respectively. The amplicons were then ligated into the NdeI/BlpI (α fusion) or NdeI/XhoI (β fusion) sites of pET25b(+), under the control of T7 polymerase. Constructs were used to transform the E. coli strain, BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIPL cells (Stratagene). Cells were grown in LB broth, under carbenicillin selection (100 μg/ml) and were induced for 3–5 h with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Bio-Rad), upon achieving an A600 nm of 0.5–0.7. Cells were spun down and frozen at −20 °C, until needed. As the protein was expressed mainly in inclusion bodies, a scheme based on a protocol reported previously (25.Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) for the refolding of HLA-DR from E. coli was employed. Initially, the pellet containing either the α or β chain was thawed in PBS, with 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After resuspension and incubation on ice for 5 min, the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall® RC-5b centrifuge using a sm-24 rotor. The soluble fraction was discarded, and the insoluble pellet was washed twice with isopropyl alcohol and centrifuged, as in the previous step. The washed pellet was then solubilized, and the His-tagged protein was purified, as per manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, His-Bind® kit"
https://openalex.org/W2077321072,"Background Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of linear chromosomes and preserves genomic integrity. The core components are a catalytic protein subunit, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), and an RNA subunit, the telomerase RNA (TR). Telomerase is unique in its ability to catalyze processive DNA synthesis, which is facilitated by telomere-specific DNA-binding domains in TERT called anchor sites. A conserved glutamine residue in the TERT N-terminus is important for anchor site interactions in lower eukaryotes. The significance of this residue in higher eukaryotes, however, has not been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings To understand the significance of this residue in higher eukaryotes, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on human TERT (hTERT) Q169 to create neutral (Q169A), conservative (Q169N), and non-conservative (Q169D) mutant proteins. We show that these mutations severely compromise telomerase activity in vitro and in vivo. The functional defects are not due to abrogated interactions with hTR or telomeric ssDNA. However, substitution of hTERT Q169 dramatically impaired the ability of telomerase to incorporate nucleotides at the second position of the template. Furthermore, Q169 mutagenesis altered the relative strength of hTERT-telomeric ssDNA interactions, which identifies Q169 as a novel residue in hTERT required for optimal primer binding. Proteolysis experiments indicate that Q169 substitution alters the protease-sensitivity of the hTERT N-terminus, indicating that a conformational change in this region of hTERT is likely critical for catalytic function. Conclusions/Significance We provide the first detailed evidence regarding the biochemical and cellular roles of an evolutionarily-conserved Gln residue in higher eukaryotes. Collectively, our results indicate that Q169 is needed to maintain the hTERT N-terminus in a conformation that is necessary for optimal enzyme-primer interactions and nucleotide incorporation. We show that Q169 is critical for the structure and function of human telomerase, thereby identifying a novel residue in hTERT that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2023244193,"Background In recent years there has been a global increase in reports of disease affecting marine sponges. While disease outbreaks have the potential to seriously impact on the survival of sponge populations, the ecology of the marine environment and the health of associated invertebrates, our understanding of sponge disease is extremely limited. Methodology/Principal Findings A collagenolytic enzyme suspected to enhance pathogenicity of bacterial strain NW4327 against the sponge Rhopaloeides odorabile was purified using combinations of size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography. After achieving a 77-fold increase in specific activity, continued purification decreased the yield to 21-fold with 7.2% recovery (specific activity 2575 collagen degrading units mg−1protein) possibly due to removal of co-factors. SDS-PAGE of the partially pure enzyme showed two proteins weighing approximately 116 and 45 kDa with the heavier band being similar to reported molecular weights of collagenases from Clostridium and marine Vibrios. The enzyme degraded tissue fibres of several sponge genera suggesting that NW4327 could be deleterious to other sponge species. Activity towards casein and bird feather keratin indicates that the partially purified collagenase is either a non-selective protease able to digest collagen or is contaminated with non-specific proteases. Enzyme activity was highest at pH 5 (the internal pH of R. odorabile) and 30°C (the average ambient seawater temperature). Activity under partially anaerobic conditions also supports the role of this enzyme in the degradation of the spongin tissue. Cultivation of NW4327 in the presence of collagen increased production of collagenase by 30%. Enhanced enzyme activity when NW4327 was cultivated in media formulated in sterile natural seawater indicates the presence of other factors that influence enzyme synthesis. Conclusions/Significance Several aspects of the sponge disease etiology were revealed, particularly the strong correlation with the internal tissue chemistry and environmental temperature. This research provides a platform for further investigations into the virulence mechanisms of sponge pathogens."

In a previous study, several HLA-B and HLA-C alleles and haplotypes were positively or negatively associated with the occurrence and prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).As an extension of the Upper Midwest Health Study, we have performed HLA genotyping for 149 GBM patients and 149 healthy control subjects from a non-metropolitan population consisting almost exclusively of European Americans. Conditional logistic regression models did not reproduce the association of HLA-B*07 or the B*07-Cw*07 haplotype with GBM. Nonetheless, HLA-A*32, which has previously been shown to predispose GBM patients to a favorable prognosis, was negatively associated with occurrence of GBM (odds ratio=0.41, p=0.04 by univariate analysis). Other alleles (A*29, A*30, A*31 and A*33) within the A19 serology group to which A*32 belongs showed inconsistent trends. Sequencing-based HLA-A genotyping established that A*3201 was the single A*32 allele underlying the observed association. Additional evaluation of HLA-A promoter and exon 1 sequences did not detect any unexpected single nucleotide polymorphisms that could suggest differential allelic expression. Further analyses restricted to female GBM cases and controls revealed a second association with a specific HLA-B sequence motif corresponding to Bw4-80Ile (odds ratio=2.71, p=0.02).HLA-A allelic product encoded by A*3201 is likely to be functionally important to GBM. The novel, sex-specific association will require further confirmation in other representative study populations."
https://openalex.org/W1998396633,"The derivation of stable multipotent trophoblast stem (TS) cell lines from preimplantation, and early postimplantation mouse embryos has been reported previously. FGF4, and its receptor FGFR2, have been identified as embryonic signaling factors responsible for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of multipotent TS cells. Here we report the derivation of stable TS-like cell lines from the vole M. rossiaemeridionalis, in the absence of FGF4 and heparin. Vole TS-like cells are similar to murine TS cells with respect to their morphology, transcription factor gene expression and differentiation in vitro into derivatives of the trophectoderm lineage, and with respect to their ability to invade and erode host tissues, forming haemorrhagic tumours after subcutaneous injection into nude mice. Moreover, vole TS-like cells carry an inactive paternal X chromosome, indicating that they have undergone imprinted X inactivation, which is characteristic of the trophoblast lineage. Our results indicate that an alternative signaling pathway may be responsible for the establishment and stable proliferation of vole TS-like cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087217178,"Studies of replicative DNA polymerases have led to the generalization that abasic sites are strong blocks to DNA replication. Here we show that yeast replicative DNA polymerase ϵ bypasses a model abasic site with comparable efficiency to Pol η and Dpo4, two translesion polymerases. DNA polymerase ϵ also exhibited high bypass efficiency with a natural abasic site on the template. Translesion synthesis primarily resulted in deletions. In cases where only a single nucleotide was inserted, dATP was the preferred nucleotide opposite the natural abasic site. In contrast to translesion polymerases, DNA polymerase ϵ with 3′–5′ proofreading exonuclease activity bypasses only the model abasic site during processive synthesis and cannot reinitiate DNA synthesis.

This characteristic may allow other pathways to rescue leading strand synthesis when stalled at an abasic site. Abasic sites are considered to be the most common DNA lesions in the genome. They arise because of the chemical instability of DNA (depurination events) and during the intermediate steps of base excision repair. Estimates have suggested that 10,000–20,000 bases are lost per day in mammalian cells; in the genome of Escherichia coli, one depurination event per hour is estimated to occur (1.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. Second Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). Abasic sites are non-instructional to DNA polymerases and highly mutagenic when encountered by the replication fork. Studies of replicative DNA polymerases from bacteriophages, bacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotic model systems have shown that abasic sites are strong blocks to polymerase activity (2.Blanca G.

Both Family A and Family B replicative polymerases have been shown to stall prior to or opposite the abasic site, including T4 DNA polymerase, T7 DNA polymerase, and yeast DNA polymerase δ (2.Blanca G.

It has been proposed that the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity of replicative DNA polymerases suppresses the insertion of nucleotides opposite abasic sites, limiting the possibility of extending synthesis beyond the DNA lesion (7.Eckert K.A.

An amino acid substitution inactivating the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity of T4 polymerase dramatically increases bypass synthesis of a tetrahydrofuran (THF) 3The abbreviations used are: THFtetrahydrofuranPolpolymeraseGSTglutathione S-transferaseWTwild typentnucleotidedsDNAdouble-stranded DNA. site when the polymerase is allowed to cycle on the primer-template (8.Tanguy Le Gac N. Delagoutte E. Germain M. Villani G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Later work showed that proofreading-deficient T4 polymerase cannot bypass abasic sites when restricted from cycling on and off the primer-template, perhaps because of restrictions imposed by the geometry of the active site (2.Blanca G.

Experiments in which single-hit conditions are clearly met demonstrate that replicative DNA polymerases cannot bypass model abasic sites. Instead, models have proposed a handoff from the replicative polymerase at the abasic site to translesion polymerases. One example is yeast DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ), which inserts a dATP opposite the abasic site, followed by extension by DNA polymerase ζ and a switch back to Pol δ (5.Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E.

Under normal growth conditions, the yeast replication fork primarily engages Pol δ in the synthesis of the lagging strand and DNA polymerase ϵ (Pol ϵ) in the synthesis of the leading strand (10.Pursell Z.F.

As a leading strand polymerase, Pol ϵ would presumably replicate a large portion of the genome and likely encounter DNA lesions if they are unrepaired when the replication fork passes the site. Although Pol δ has been extensively studied, less is known about how Pol ϵ functions when encountering a DNA lesion. So far, studies indicate that Pol ϵ stalls at cis-syn thymine dimers and a highly mutagenic benzo[a]pyrene DNA adduct (12.McCulloch S.D. Kokoska R.J. Chilkova O. Welch C.M. Johansson E. Burgers P.M.

Johansson E. Chabes A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5660-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have now extended our studies to abasic sites, including both a commonly used THF moiety (a model abasic site) and a natural abasic site in the template strand. We find that Pol ϵ has unexpectedly high bypass efficiency and that the bypass is highly mutagenic. The glutathione S-transferase tag (GST tag) fused with the POL2 gene was amplified from the PJL1-GST plasmid using the oligonucleotides GST forward PJL1 (5′-CGTCAAGGAGAAAAAACCCCGGATCCACTAGTTCTAGATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTG-3′) and GST reverse PJL1 (5′- GGAAGATCCTCCGTTGTTTTTTTTCTTGCCAAACATCATCAGGGGCCCCTGGAACAGAACTT-3′), and purified on an agarose gel. The PJL1 exo− was cleaved by NotI. The strain PY116 containing plasmid PJL6 (15.Chilkova O. Jonsson B.H. Johansson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14082-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was transformed with the purified PCR product and the cleaved plasmid. The transformants were selected on SC-ura-trp. The expression of the GST-Pol ϵ fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot. The purification of Pol2/Dpb2 (wild-type (WT) and exonuclease-deficient (pol2–4)) and Pol2 was carried out as described previously (16.Asturias F.J. Cheung I.K. Sabouri N. Chilkova O. Wepplo D. Johansson E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Pol ϵ exo+ and Pol ϵ exo− (pol2–4) were purified in parallel as described earlier but with the following modifications. The resuspended ammonium sulfate precipitate was dialyzed against B100 for 2 h (the suffix in all buffer names indicates the concentration of sodium acetate in the buffer; for example, buffer B300 is buffer B with 300 mm sodium acetate). The dialyzed extract was mixed with 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose equilibrated in B300 and slowly rotated for 4 h. The glutathione-Sepharose with bound GST-Pol ϵ or GST-Pol ϵ exo− was collected on a column and washed with 15 column volumes of B300. PreScission protease was added to the column and incubated overnight at 4 °C to cleave and remove the GST tag. The following morning, the column was eluted with 10 × 0.5 column volumes. The eluted proteins were pooled and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono-Q column and separated over a linear salt gradient from B750 to B1200, followed by gel filtration on a Superose 6 gel filtration column with B400 as the running buffer (15.Chilkova O.

The enzyme-to-DNA ratios used in the primer-extension assays were 1:10 for Pol ϵ exo+; 1:7 for Pol ϵ exo−; 1:5 for Pol2/Dpb2 exo+ and Pol2/Dpb2 exo−; 1:1 for Pol2; and 1:50 for Klenow exo−; or a 2-fold molar excess of enzyme over DNA, unless otherwise indicated, e.g. in Fig. 4.

Single-hit conditions were confirmed by calculating the termination probability of the undamaged templates by dividing the intensity of band N with the intensity of bands at position N and beyond. The relative bypass efficiency was calculated by dividing the bypass probability of the damaged template with the bypass probability of the undamaged template; the bypass probability for the damaged template was calculated by dividing the sum of the products after the lesion position with the sum of the products from the nucleotide before the lesion and beyond as described by Kunkel and colleagues (17.Kokoska R.J.

The natural abasic template was constructed by cleaving 0.1 nmol of uracil-containing template with 1 unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase (Fermentas) at 37 °C for 70 min. To avoid breakage of the natural abasic template, the corresponding primer was heated at 55 °C for 10 min, and the natural abasic template was added to the solution and heated for an additional 1 min. The template was slowly cooled to room temperature. Primer-extension assays with Dpo4 (Trevigen) were performed in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm dNTP, and 2 nm primer-template (Seq1–58 nt) at 70 °C. Biotinylated Acc65I overhang primer (5′-Biotin-GTAGGTACCGATCTACGAGAGATACCATTACACGGATTCGATAGTATgCTCTgAGGACGATTCGATCCTG-3′) was annealed at a 1:1 molar ratio to a complementary template, EcoRI template (5′-AGATGGAATTCGTTTACACTGTCGCGTAAXUTAGCAGGATCGAATCGTCCTtAGAGgATACTATCGAATCCGTGTAATGG-3′). The X indicates A, T, C, or G, and the U indicates the position of a THF moiety or a uracil. The uracil was removed by uracil-N-glycosylase (Fermentas) to create a natural abasic site. Lowercase letters in the oligonucleotide sequence indicate positions of mismatched bases used to identify the strand after cloning into a plasmid. The primer-template (1 pmol) was incubated with WT Pol ϵ (0.2 μm) for 30 min at 30 °C as described for the primer-extension reactions. The product was bound to Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal Biotech) for 3 h as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. Next, the product was washed five times with washing buffer (Dynal Biotech) and once with water using a Dynal Magnetic Particle Concentrator (Dynal MPC) to remove all non-biotinylated components. To remove the template containing the uracil/abasic site, the immobilized primer-template was incubated with 150 μl of 0.1 m NaOH for 5 min to denature the primer-template. The immobilized primer was collected with the Dynal MPC, and the template with the uracil/abasic site was removed in the supernatant. The bound primer was washed once with 0.1 m NaOH and two times with TE buffer, pH 7.6, when bound to the Dynal MPC. Recombinant Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase (Fermentas) was used in the PCR to amplify the purified biotinylated primer, which was previously extended by Pol ϵ in the primer-extension reaction. The PCR was carried out with Primer 1 (5′-CTAGCAGATGATGTAACGCTTCTCAGATGGAATTCGTTTACACTGTCGC-3′) and Primer 2 (5′-GTAGGTACCGATCTACGAGAG-3′). The PCR product (129 bp) was purified and cleaved by Acc65I and EcoRI at 37 °C, followed by ligation into the Acc65I and EcoRI sites of the pBluescript II SK+ vector. The ligation mixture was transformed into chemically competent E. coli cells, colonies were amplified, and the plasmids isolated and sent to MWG Biotech (Germany) for sequencing of the insert. To study the ability of yeast Pol ϵ to bypass abasic sites, we first chose the widely used abasic site analogue, a THF moiety. This allows a comparison with reported bypass properties of other DNA polymerases. Primer-extension assays were carried out under single-hit conditions with a THF moiety in the template or an identical template with an undamaged nucleotide replacing the abasic site (Table 1). The assay conditions were empirically determined to ensure that Pol ϵ was not allowed to cycle to a previously extended primer (14.Sabouri N. Viberg J. Goyal D.K. Johansson E. Chabes A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5660-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Asturias F.J. Cheung I.K. Sabouri N. Chilkova O. Wepplo D. Johansson E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The THF moiety or undamaged nucleotide was positioned four residues downstream of the 3′-end of the primer so that Pol ϵ would reach the residue during processive synthesis. Three different templates with randomly chosen sequences: sequence 1–58 nt dsDNA (Seq1–58 nt), sequence 2–58 nt dsDNA (Seq2–58 nt), and sequence 3–57 nt dsDNA (Seq3–57 nt), were incubated with Pol ϵ for 2 or 8 min (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The majority of the replication products ended one or two nucleotides before the THF moiety. Surprisingly, we found that Pol ϵ also carried out translesion synthesis (Fig. 1A). The strategy to compare two substrates that are identical with the exception of the THF moiety on the damaged template allows a relative bypass efficiency to be calculated as described by Kunkel and colleagues (17.Kokoska R.J.

As shown for other DNA polymerases, the bypass efficiency was influenced by the sequence context in which the abasic site was located (Table 2). Remarkably, the bypass efficiency of Pol ϵ (6–17%) was comparable with previously reported values for human DNA polymerase η (10–13%) and Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 (13–30%), two typical Y family translesion polymerases (Table 2) (17.Kokoska R.J.

In comparison, the replicative T7 DNA polymerase was reported to have less than 0.2% bypass efficiency, placing it below the level of detection (Table 2) (6.McCulloch S.D. Kunkel T.A.

Open table in a new tab This ability of Pol ϵ to bypass a model abasic site under single-hit conditions is unprecedented among Family B polymerases. To investigate the influence of the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity of Pol ϵ on bypass efficiency for a THF moiety, we overexpressed and purified an exonuclease-deficient form of Pol ϵ (the pol2–4 allele). The exonuclease-deficient Pol ϵ (Pol ϵ exo−) was used in primer-extension assays with the undamaged and damaged templates as described for WT Pol ϵ. The Pol ϵ exo− could bypass the lesion (Fig. 1B) with only a slightly increased bypass efficiency compared with the WT Pol ϵ (Table 2). In all cases, the insertion efficiency was greater for Pol ϵ exo− compared with WT Pol ϵ. In contrast, the extension efficiency was lower for Pol ϵ exo− compared with WT Pol ϵ. Again, sequence context influenced the bypass efficiency, and in this case, a more inhibitory sequence context benefited more from the inactivation of the proofreading activity (Table 2). As a control, we added an exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment (Kf exo−) in primer-extension assays with the Seq1–58 nt, Seq2–58 nt, and Seq3–57 nt templates. The synthesis on the undamaged template was distributive when compared with Pol ϵ (supplemental Fig. S1). No translesion synthesis was found with the 2-min incubation time, but a nucleotide was efficiently incorporated opposite the abasic site (see supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1) (17.Kokoska R.J. McCulloch S.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50537-50545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The inability to bypass the THF moiety was unaffected by dNTP concentrations, and extended reaction times did not yield measurable bypass products (supplemental Fig. S1). These findings verified that the translesion synthesis by Pol ϵ was carried out on the model abasic site and demonstrated that Pol ϵ has a unique property that allows translesion synthesis in the absence of a processivity clamp. Previous work showed that the intrinsically high processivity of Pol ϵ depends, in part, on the interaction between an extended tail domain and the primer-template (16.Asturias F.J. Cheung I.K. Sabouri N. Chilkova O. Wepplo D. Johansson E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the tail domain consists of three subunits (Dpb2, Dpb3, and Dpb4). To examine if the extended tail domain of Pol ϵ influences translesion synthesis capacity, we purified three variants of Pol ϵ that lacked subunits from the tail domain: an exonuclease-proficient Pol2/Dpb2 complex (Pol2/Dpb2), an exonuclease-deficient Pol2/Dpb2 complex (Pol2/Dpb2 exo−), and the exonuclease-proficient Pol2 subunit (Pol2). These complexes lacked two or three non-catalytic subunits, and we expected that a fully functional interaction between the enzyme and the primer-template duplex would not be established (16.Asturias F.J. Cheung I.K. Sabouri N. Chilkova O. Wepplo D. Johansson E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Again, primer-extension assays were carried out under single-hit conditions with the three primer-template duplexes. However, the empirically determined ratio of polymerase to DNA was changed because of inefficient primer utilization. The bypass efficiency of the Pol2/Dpb2 complex and Pol2 was slightly reduced compared with Pol ϵ on templates Seq1–58 nt and Seq2–58 nt (see Fig. 1, C and E, and Table 2). However, no bypass was detected when Seq3–57 nt was used as the template (Table 2). The bypass efficiency of Pol2/Dpb2 exo− was clearly reduced when compared with Pol ϵ exo− on all three templates (see Fig. 1, B and D, and Table 2). Earlier results showed that Pol ϵ requires a minimal primer length of 40 base pairs of dsDNA for processive DNA synthesis. A 20-nt primer-template duplex did not support fully processive synthesis by Pol ϵ (16.Asturias F.J. Cheung I.K. Sabouri N. Chilkova O. Wepplo D. Johansson E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For this reason, we chose a shorter version of Seq1, which had the highest bypass efficiency of all templates used, with only a 20-nt dsDNA (Seq1–20 nt) instead of 58 nt. We added Pol ϵ and Pol ϵ exo− to Seq1–20 nt and empirically determined the ratio of polymerase to DNA, which allowed us to perform the experiments under single-hit conditions. Again, because of inefficient primer utilization, we used a higher ratio of polymerase to DNA compared with the longer primer-template duplexes (16.Asturias F.J. Cheung I.K. Sabouri N. Chilkova O. Wepplo D. Johansson E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found that Pol ϵ mainly stalled before the abasic site and that only a minor fraction of the products had a nucleotide inserted opposite the abasic site (Fig. 1F, lanes 4 and 5). Pol ϵ exo− frequently added nucleotides opposite the abasic site but extended only a minor fraction of the insertions before dissociating (Fig. 1F, lanes 8 and 9). Pol ϵ exo− could not extend synthesis beyond one nucleotide after the abasic site, even when equimolar amounts of enzyme and DNA were used (Fig. 1F, lanes 10 and 11). Earlier studies found that polymerases are more successful at bypassing an abasic site if allowed repeated attempts to extend a primer (6.McCulloch S.D. Kunkel T.A. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1373-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8.Tanguy Le Gac N. Delagoutte E. Germain M. Villani G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To allow Pol ϵ to repeatedly cycle onto the primer-template, we carried out reactions with a 2-fold molar excess of enzyme over DNA for 10 min. To quantify the capacity of Pol ϵ to bypass the abasic site when given multiple opportunities, we first measured the sum of products after the lesion (nt +1 and longer; Fig. 2) divided by the sum of products starting from the nucleotide upstream of the abasic site (nt −1 and longer; Fig. 2). The obtained value for the damaged template was divided by the corresponding value for the undamaged template. The resulting number allowed us to compare the capacity of Pol ϵ, Pol ϵ exo−, Pol2/Dpb2, Pol2/Dpb2 exo−, and Pol2 to perform translesion synthesis under the given conditions. We found that exonuclease-deficient Pol ϵ and Pol2/Dpb2 exo− had greater capacities to extend the synthesis past the abasic site (Fig. 2). In contrast, the exonuclease-proficient enzymes did not improve their bypass capacity compared with the bypass efficiency at single-hit conditions (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). This observation suggests that the WT Pol ϵ has only one opportunity to bypass the abasic site: when an abasic site enters the polymerase site during the processive synthesis of new DNA. The primer-extension assays with excess enzyme revealed that proofreading-deficient Pol ϵ had strong pause sites at the first two nucleotides downstream of the abasic site (nt +1 and +2; Fig. 2). In contrast, no such pause sites were found when proofreading-proficient Pol ϵ was used. This difference led us to investigate whether this also was true for Pol ϵ and Pol ϵ exo− under single-hit conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). We plotted the termination probability for Pol ϵ and Pol ϵ exo− on both undamaged and damaged templates across the area of interest in the experiments from Fig. 1, A and B (Fig. 3). The results show that Pol ϵ has the highest termination probability at the nucleotide preceding the abasic site, followed by a slightly decreased termination probability at the abasic site. The termination probability reached a steady state at the first nucleotide positioned downstream of the abasic site. In contrast, we found that Pol ϵ exo− has the highest termination probability at the abasic site and maintained a high termination probability for three to four nucleotides downstream of the abasic site on the Seq2–58 nt and Seq3–57 nt templates (Fig. 3). This difference suggests that Pol ϵ can identify the abasic site for the same distance as single-base deletions in homonucleotide runs during normal DNA replication (20.Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I. Chilkova O. Rogozin I.B. Johansson E. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43770-43780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The structures of natural abasic sites and THF moieties differ slightly, and their geometry could influence the translesion synthesis properties of Pol ϵ when they are located in the active site. We constructed natural abasic sites by replacing the THF moiety in Seq1–58 nt with deoxyuracil, followed by treatment with uracil-N-glycosylase to remove the uracil base. The natural abasic site-containing template was incubated with WT Pol ϵ under single-hit conditions. The bypass efficiency was even higher than with the model abasic site (Fig. 4). A side-by-side comparison with Dpo4 revealed that the relative bypass efficiency was similar between Pol ϵ and Dpo4 (68 and 69%, respectively). The relative bypass efficiency was 24% for Dpo4 with a THF moiety in the same experiment, comparable with previously reported values (see Table 1). The uracil was efficiently removed from the template, as shown by the shorter replication products (Fig. 4A). To examine the fidelity of the bypass we performed primer-extension assays on a larger scale. After that the extension products were purified on magnetic beads, PCR amplified with a limited number of cycles, subcloned into a plasmid, and sequenced (supplemental Fig. S2). The untreated uracil-containing template resulted in 100% dATP incorporation opposite the uracil. The uracil-N-glycosylase-treated template generated a variety of mutations that could be divided into groups, either the insertion of a nucleotide opposite the abasic site or generation of a deletion (Table 3). The nucleotide context of Seq1–58 nt, with the highest bypass efficiency, resulted in mostly insertions, where dATP was the most common insertion. We exchanged the nucleotides flanking the natural abasic site and found that the vast majority of the bypass products resulted in deletions (Table 3). Still, dATP was the most frequently inserted nucleotide when the bypass resulted in the insertion of a nucleotide. In contrast, dGTP was the most frequently inserted nucleotide when a THF moiety was positioned on Seq1–58 nt (see Table 3). This suggested that Pol ϵ may use the same bypass mechanism as Dpo4, where the nucleotide located 5′ of the THF moiety determines what will be inserted across the abasic site (21.Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Exchanging the 5′-nucleotide resulted in bypass products that predominantly carried a −1 nt deletion (see Table 3). We conclude that the bypass of natural abasic sites by Pol ϵ is highly mutagenic and the large number of frameshifts is a serious threat to the integrity of the genome unless repaired.TABLE 3Fidelity of translesion synthesis by Pol ϵ across a natural abasic site or a THF moietyTemplate 3′–5No. of sequence coloniesNumber of nucleotides inserted during TLS (%)aTLS, translesion synthesis.Number of deletions during TLS (%)Other mutationsAGCTSingleDoubleTripleLargerNatural abasic siteTXC7937 (47)9 (11)5 (6)7 (9)14 (18)2 (2)02 (2)3 (4)TXT7013 (19)00010 (14)9 (13)5 (7)28 (40)5 (7)TXA645 (8)00015 (23)2 (3)8 (7)28 (40)5 (7)TXG8118 (22)2 (2)1 (1)019 (23)9 (11)4 (5)23 (28)5 (6)AXG698 (12)00020 (29)6 (9)7 (10)25 (36)3 (4)UracilTUC2727 (100)00000000TUT3030 (100)00000000TUA3030 (100)00000000TUG3030 (100)00000000AUG3030 (100)00000000THF moietyTXC641 (2)41 (64)01 (2)13 (20)3 (5)1 (2)04 (6)TXT43000026 (60)3 (7)1 (2)9 (21)3 (7)TXA47000033 (70)7 (15)1 (2)06 (13)TXG52000041 (79)3 (6)1 (2)2 (4)5 (10)a TLS, translesion synthesis. Open table in a new tab We present evidence that the Family B DNA polymerase ϵ has, for replicative DNA polymerases, unprecedented translesion capacity across abasic sites and that the bypass primarily results in deletions. When inserting a nucleotide opposite the natural abasic site, Pol ϵ does follow the “A-rule.” In either case, the bypass of abasic sites by Pol ϵ is highly mutagenic, but genetic experiments in yeast have shown that damage-induced mutagenesis depends on the Pol32 subunit of Pol δ, Pol ζ, and Rev1 (5.Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22.Gibbs P.E. McDonald J. Woodgate R. Lawrence C.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The ability of Pol ϵ to carry out error-prone translesion synthesis has several implications. One possibility could be that abasic sites are efficiently repaired so that the replication fork and Pol ϵ rarely encounter them. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in vivo studies of translesion synthesis across abasic sites on plasmids or in chromatin were carried out in strains with deleted apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases (APN1 and APN2), which are important for base excision repair (5.Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 23.Pagès V. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25.Auerbach P. Bennett R.A. Bailey E.A. Krokan H.E. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17711-17716Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another, perhaps more likely, possibility is the existence of leading strand-specific, error-free repair pathways that protect the genome from error-prone translesion synthesis by Pol ϵ or other DNA polymerases acting on the leading strand. Several pathways have been suggested that involve homologous recombination with the sister chromatid and are virtually error-free (26.Budzowska M. Kanaar R. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 53: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the leading and lagging strands synthesize new DNA differ and may also influence how DNA lesions are bypassed. Studies on the effect of UV lesions have suggested that leading strand synthesis is blocked, whereas the lagging strand synthesis continues (27.Mezzina M. Menck C.F. Courtin P. Sarasin A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4249-4258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Lopes M. Foiani M. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 15-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This difference would be natural because the lagging strand polymerase always has a new primer available further upstream from the DNA lesion. A gap remains behind the replication fork that can later be filled in by, for example, Pol δ and Pol ζ in a collaborative effort. A DNA lesion on the leading strand may have a dual effect, however. It is likely that a DNA-damage checkpoint is activated as the helicase is uncoupled from the replication fork and long stretches of single-stranded DNA are generated (29.Byun T.S. Pacek M. Yee M.C. Walter J.C. Cimprich K.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Another consequence is that a replication restart is required to complete leading strand synthesis. The mechanism of achieving the restart is not clear in eukaryotes but could involve fork reversal, sister-chromatid exchange, or perhaps a new primer synthesized downstream of the DNA lesion, as shown for the E. coli replisome (26.Budzowska M. Kanaar R. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 53: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28.Lopes M. Foiani M. Sogo J.M. Mol.

DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Repriming would leave a gap with single-stranded DNA that other DNA polymerases could later fill in, presumably Pol δ, Pol ζ, and Rev1. We have shown that Pol ϵ bypasses abasic sites with comparable efficiency to Dpo4 when first encountering a natural abasic site. In contrast to Dpo4, Pol ϵ seems unable to reinitiate synthesis at the abasic site when dissociated from the template. The proofreading activity of Pol ϵ limits the possibility for Pol ϵ to bypass the abasic site, whereas Dpo4 can bypass most abasic sites given multiple opportunities at the lesion. In most cases, Pol ϵ will dissociate, most likely affecting replication fork progression. The stalled replication fork will activate a DNA-damage checkpoint, and the free 3′-termini of the nascent strand may be accessible to translesion synthesis by other DNA polymerases. We have earlier shown that Pol ϵ and Pol δ are loaded onto the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-primer ternary complex by different mechanisms, which might in part explain the division of labor at the replication fork under normal DNA replication (33.Chilkova O. Stenlund P. Isoz I. Stith C.M. Grabowski P. Lundström E.B. Burgers P.M. Johansson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6588-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The work also demonstrated that Pol δ depends on a functional proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interaction motif, which also can be found in translesion polymerases, for the loading onto the proliferating cell nuclear antigen primer-ternary complex. Genetic experiments in which the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interaction motif located in the Pol δ subunit Pol32 was deleted yielded decreased DNA damage-induced mutagenesis (24.Johansson E. Garg P. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A plasmid-based assay recently showed that Pol32 was required for mutagenic translesion synthesis on both the leading and lagging strands (23.Pagès V. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, translesion synthesis opposite the abasic site occurred with a frequency of only about 6%. This finding suggested that the majority of bypass events were processed via other error-free mechanisms. Damage-induced mutagenesis would then appear when the error-free systems are saturated, allowing Pol δ, Pol ζ, and Rev1 to carry out error-prone gap-filling synthesis on both the leading and lagging strands. Elegant experiments with inducible endogenous AP sites in apn1Δ strains support this model as the bypass depended on REV7 and REV1, with essentially no difference between leading and lagging strands (25.Auerbach P. Bennett R.A. Bailey E.A. Krokan H.E. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17711-17716Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pol ϵ often generates frameshifts when bypassing the natural abasic site. This would most likely be recognized by the mismatch repair system and the strand that was synthesized by Pol ϵ would be replaced by new DNA. Presumably Pol δ, Pol ζ and Rev1 would fill in the gap, leaving their typical error signature and mask the error-prone bypass synthesis by Pol ϵ. Again, high levels of AP sites would potentially saturate the systems, Pol δ, Pol ζ, and Rev1 would participate on both leading and lagging strands and there would not be a significant difference between leading and lagging strands. These models explain why damage-induced mutagenesis depends on Pol32, even if Pol32 acts on the lagging strand during normal DNA replication. The capacity of Pol ϵ to bypass abasic sites and the dependence of Pol32, Pol ζ, and Rev1 in damage-induced mutagenesis suggests that DNA lesions on the leading strand are processed by error-free repair pathways. The error-prone bypass by Pol δ, Pol ζ, and Rev1 would then rescue the replication fork when the error-free pathways are saturated under massive DNA damage.

https://openalex.org/W2101155834,"We have studied the function of the zinc finger transcription factor gata3 in auditory system development by analysing temporal profiles of gene expression during differentiation of conditionally immortal cell lines derived to model specific auditory cell types and developmental stages. We tested and applied a novel probabilistic method called the gamma Model for Oligonucleotide Signals to analyse hybridization signals from Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays. Expression levels estimated by this method correlated closely (p<0.0001) across a 10-fold range with those measured by quantitative RT-PCR for a sample of 61 different genes. In an unbiased list of 26 genes whose temporal profiles clustered most closely with that of gata3 in all cell lines, 10 were linked to Insulin-like Growth Factor signalling, including the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB. Knock-down of gata3 in vitro was associated with a decrease in expression of genes linked to IGF-signalling, including IGF1, IGF2 and several IGF-binding proteins. It also led to a small decrease in protein levels of the serine-threonine kinase Akt2/PKBbeta, a dramatic increase in Akt1/PKBalpha protein and relocation of Akt1/PKBalpha from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1), a known target of PKB/Akt, simultaneously decreased. In heterozygous gata3 null mice the expression of gata3 correlated with high levels of activated Akt/PKB. This functional relationship could explain the diverse function of gata3 during development, the hearing loss associated with gata3 heterozygous null mice and the broader symptoms of human patients with Hearing-Deafness-Renal anomaly syndrome."

The relative number of references in each category reflects past and present areas of research on immune reactivities. In addition to describing the overall landscape of data distribution, this particular characterization of the epitope reference data also allows for the exploration of possible correlations with global disease morbidity and mortality data.While in most cases diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality rates were amongst the most studied, a number of high impact diseases such as dengue, Schistosoma, HSV-2, B. pertussis and Chlamydia trachoma, were found to have very little coverage. The data analyzed in this fashion represents the first estimate of how reported immunological data corresponds to disease-related morbidity and mortality, and confirms significant discrepancies in the overall research foci versus disease burden, thus identifying important gaps to be pursued by future research. These findings may also provide a justification for redirecting a portion of research funds into some of the underfunded, critical disease areas."
https://openalex.org/W2042475036,"Dual epidemics of the malaria parasite Plasmodium and HIV-1 in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia present a significant risk for co-infection in these overlapping endemic regions. Recent studies of HIV/Plasmodium falciparum co-infection have reported significant interactions of these pathogens, including more rapid CD4+ T cell loss, increased viral load, increased immunosuppression, and increased episodes of clinical malaria. Here, we describe a novel rhesus macaque model for co-infection that supports and expands upon findings in human co-infection studies and can be used to identify interactions between these two pathogens.Five rhesus macaques were infected with P. cynomolgi and, following three parasite relapses, with SIV. Compared to macaques infected with SIV alone, co-infected animals had, as a group, decreased survival time and more rapid declines in markers for SIV progression, including peripheral CD4+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios. The naïve CD4+ T cell pool of the co-infected animals was depleted more rapidly than animals infected with SIV alone. The co-infected animals also failed to generate proliferative responses to parasitemia by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as B cells while also having a less robust anti-parasite and altered anti-SIV antibody response.These data suggest that infection with both SIV and Plasmodium enhances SIV-induced disease progression and impairs the anti-Plasmodium immune response. These data support findings in HIV/Plasmodium co-infection studies. This animal model can be used to further define impacts of lentivirus and Plasmodium co-infection and guide public health and therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1966422478,"Because passage of the bacterium to blood is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of many group B Streptococcus (GBS) invasive infections, we recently conducted a whole-genome transcriptome analysis during GBS incubation ex vivo with human blood. In the current work, we sought to analyze in detail the difference in GBS gene expression that occurred in one blood sample (donor A) relative to other blood samples. We incubated GBS strain NEM316 with fresh heparinized human blood obtained from healthy volunteers, and analyzed GBS genome expression and cytokine production. Principal component analysis identified extensive clustering of the transcriptome data among all samples at time 0. In striking contrast, the whole bacterial gene expression in the donor A blood sample was significantly different from the gene expression in all other blood samples studied, both after 30 and 90 min of incubation. More genes were up-regulated in donor A blood relative to the other samples, at 30 min and 90 min. Furthermore, there was significant variation in transcript levels between donor A blood and other blood samples. Notably, genes with the highest transcript levels in donor A blood were those involved in carbohydrate metabolism. We also discovered an unusual production of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines: MIF, tPAI-1 and IL-1beta were produced at higher levels in donor A blood relative to the other blood samples, whereas GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-7 and IL-10 remained at lower levels in donor A blood. Potential reasons for our observations are that the immune response of donor A significantly influenced the bacterial transcriptome, or both GBS gene expression and immune response were influenced by the metabolic status of donor A."
https://openalex.org/W2103208135,"Background Lysine-ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH) is a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the first two steps of lysine catabolism in plants and mammals. However, to date, the properties of the lysine degradation pathway and biological functions of LKR/SDH have been very little described in arthropods such as ticks. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated and characterized the gene encoding lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR, EC 1.5.1.8) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH, EC 1.5.1.9) from a tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, cDNA library that encodes a bifunctional polypeptide bearing domains similar to the plant and mammalian LKR/SDH enzymes. Expression of LKR/SDH was detected in all developmental stages, indicating an important role throughout the tick life cycle, including a long period of starvation after detachment from the host. The LKR/SDH mRNA transcripts were more abundant in unfed and starved ticks than in fed and engorged ticks, suggesting that tick LKR/SDH are important for the starved tick. Gene silencing of LKR/SDH by RNAi indicated that the tick LKR/SDH plays an integral role in the osmotic regulation of water balance and development of eggs in ovary of engorged females. Conclusions/Significance Transcription analysis and gene silencing of LKR/SDH indicated that tick LKR/SDH enzyme plays not only important roles in egg production, reproduction and development of the tick, but also in carbon, nitrogen and water balance, crucial physiological processes for the survival of ticks. This is the first report on the role of LKR/SDH in osmotic regulation in animals including vertebrate and arthropods."
https://openalex.org/W2037250936,"Background Many important biological processes are controlled through cell-cell interactions, including the colonization of metastatic tumor cells and the control of differentiation of stem cells within their niche. Despite the crucial importance of the cellular environment in regulating cellular signaling, in vitro methods for the study of such interactions are difficult and/or indirect. Methodology/Principal Findings We report on the development of an image-based method for distinguishing two cell types grown in coculture. Furthermore, cells of one type that are in direct contact with cells of a second type (adjacent cells) can be analyzed separately from cells that are not within a single well. Changes are evaluated using population statistics, which are useful in detecting subtle changes across two populations. We have used this system to characterize changes in the LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line when grown in contact with human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). We find that the expression and phosphorylation of WWOX is reduced in LNCaP cells when grown in direct contact with HUVECs. Reduced WWOX signaling has been associated with reduced activation or expression of JNK and p73. We find that p73 levels are also reduced in LNCaP cells grown in contact with HUVECs, but we did not observe such a change in JNK levels. Conclusions/Significance We find that the method described is statistically robust and can be adapted to a wide variety of studies where cell function or signaling are affected by heterotypic cell-cell contact. Ironically, a potential challenge to the method is its high level of sensitivity is capable of classifying events as statistically significant (due to the high number cells evaluated individually), when the biological effect may be less clear. The methodology would be best used in conjunction with additional methods to evaluate the biological role of potentially subtle differences between populations. However, many important events, such as the establishment of a metastatic tumor, occur through rare but important changes, and methods such as we describe here can be used to identify and characterize the contribution of the environment to these changes."
https://openalex.org/W2089100006,"The multi-stage hypothesis suggests that cancers develop through a single defined series of genetic alterations. This hypothesis was first suggested over 50 years ago based upon age-specific incidence data. However, recent molecular studies of tumors indicate that multiple routes exist to the formation of cancer, not a single route. This parallel route hypothesis has not been tested with age-specific incidence data.To test the parallel route hypothesis, I formulated it in terms of a mathematical equation and then tested whether this equation was consistent with age-specific incidence data compiled by the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries since 1973. I used the chi-squared goodness of fit test to measure consistency. The age-specific incidence data from most human carcinomas, including those of the colon, lung, prostate, and breast were consistent with the parallel route hypothesis. However, this hypothesis is only consistent if an immune sub-population exists, one that will never develop carcinoma. Furthermore, breast carcinoma has two distinct forms of the disease, and one of these occurs at significantly different rates in different racial groups.I conclude that the parallel route hypothesis is consistent with the age-specific incidence data only if carcinoma occurs in a distinct sub population, while the multi-stage hypothesis is inconsistent with this data."
