https://openalex.org/W4311436944,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to cause multi-organ dysfunction1–3 during acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with some patients experiencing prolonged symptoms, termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (refs. 4,5). However, the burden of infection outside the respiratory tract and time to viral clearance are not well characterized, particularly in the brain3,6–14. Here we carried out complete autopsies on 44 patients who died with COVID-19, with extensive sampling of the central nervous system in 11 of these patients, to map and quantify the distribution, replication and cell-type specificity of SARS-CoV-2 across the human body, including the brain, from acute infection to more than seven months following symptom onset. We show that SARS-CoV-2 is widely distributed, predominantly among patients who died with severe COVID-19, and that virus replication is present in multiple respiratory and non-respiratory tissues, including the brain, early in infection. Further, we detected persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA in multiple anatomic sites, including throughout the brain, as late as 230 days following symptom onset in one case. Despite extensive distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA throughout the body, we observed little evidence of inflammation or direct viral cytopathology outside the respiratory tract. Our data indicate that in some patients SARS-CoV-2 can cause systemic infection and persist in the body for months. A study reports the distribution, replication and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the human body including in the brain at autopsy from acute infection to more than seven months following symptom onset."
https://openalex.org/W4311472757,"The World Health Organization has a mandate to compile and disseminate statistics on mortality, and we have been tracking the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic since the beginning of 20201. Reported statistics on COVID-19 mortality are problematic for many countries owing to variations in testing access, differential diagnostic capacity and inconsistent certification of COVID-19 as cause of death. Beyond what is directly attributable to it, the pandemic has caused extensive collateral damage that has led to losses of lives and livelihoods. Here we report a comprehensive and consistent measurement of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by estimating excess deaths, by month, for 2020 and 2021. We predict the pandemic period all-cause deaths in locations lacking complete reported data using an overdispersed Poisson count framework that applies Bayesian inference techniques to quantify uncertainty. We estimate 14.83 million excess deaths globally, 2.74 times more deaths than the 5.42 million reported as due to COVID-19 for the period. There are wide variations in the excess death estimates across the six World Health Organization regions. We describe the data and methods used to generate these estimates and highlight the need for better reporting where gaps persist. We discuss various summary measures, and the hazards of ranking countries' epidemic responses."

Although macrophages in the central nervous system have been implicated in myelin health 1 , it is unknown which macrophage populations are involved and which aspects they influence. Here we show that resident microglia are crucial for the maintenance of myelin health in adulthood in both mice and humans. We demonstrate that microglia are dispensable for developmental myelin ensheathment. However, they are required for subsequent regulation of myelin growth and associated cognitive function, and for preservation of myelin integrity by preventing its degeneration. We show that loss of myelin health due to the absence of microglia is associated with the appearance of a myelinating oligodendrocyte state with altered lipid metabolism. Moreover, this mechanism is regulated through disruption of the TGFβ1–TGFβR1 axis. Our findings highlight microglia as promising therapeutic targets for conditions in which myelin growth and integrity are dysregulated, such as in ageing and neurodegenerative disease 2,3 ."

Immunotherapies have had limited efficacy in HGSOC11-13, highlighting an unmet need to assess how mutational processes and the anatomical sites of tumour foci determine the immunological states of the tumour microenvironment. Here we carried out an integrative analysis of whole-genome sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, digital histopathology and multiplexed immunofluorescence of 160 tumour sites from 42 treatment-naive patients with HGSOC. Homologous recombination-deficient HRD-Dup (BRCA1 mutant-like) and HRD-Del (BRCA2 mutant-like) tumours harboured inflammatory signalling and ongoing immunoediting, reflected in loss of HLA diversity and tumour infiltration with highly differentiated dysfunctional CD8+ T cells. By contrast, foldback-inversion-bearing tumours exhibited elevated immunosuppressive TGFβ signalling and immune exclusion, with predominantly naive/stem-like and memory T cells. Phenotypic state associations were specific to anatomical sites, highlighting compositional, topological and functional differences between adnexal tumours and distal peritoneal foci. Our findings implicate anatomical sites and mutational processes as determinants of evolutionary phenotypic divergence and immune resistance mechanisms in HGSOC. Our study provides a multi-omic cellular phenotype data substrate from which to develop and interpret future personalized immunotherapeutic approaches and early detection research."
https://openalex.org/W4311249339,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains a tightly regulated immune system. However, knowledge is lacking about how CSF immunity is altered with aging or neurodegenerative disease. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on CSF from 45 cognitively normal subjects ranging from 54 to 82 years old. We uncovered an upregulation of lipid transport genes in monocytes with age. We then compared this cohort with 14 cognitively impaired subjects. In cognitively impaired subjects, downregulation of lipid transport genes in monocytes occurred concomitantly with altered cytokine signaling to CD8 T cells. Clonal CD8 T effector memory cells upregulated C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) in cognitively impaired subjects. The CXCR6 ligand, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16), was elevated in the CSF of cognitively impaired subjects, suggesting CXCL16-CXCR6 signaling as a mechanism for antigen-specific T cell entry into the brain. Cumulatively, these results reveal cerebrospinal fluid immune dysregulation during healthy brain aging and cognitive impairment."

https://openalex.org/W4311472750,"Our understanding of human early development is severely hampered by limited access to embryonic tissues. Due to their close evolutionary relationship with humans, nonhuman primates are often used as surrogates to understand human development but currently suffer from a lack of in vivo datasets, especially from gastrulation to early organogenesis during which the major embryonic cell types are dynamically specified. To fill this gap, we collected six Carnegie stage 8-11 cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) embryos and performed in-depth transcriptomic analyses of 56,636 single cells. Our analyses show transcriptomic features of major perigastrulation cell types, which help shed light on morphogenetic events including primitive streak development, somitogenesis, gut tube formation, neural tube patterning and neural crest differentiation in primates. In addition, comparative analyses with mouse embryos and human embryoids uncovered conserved and divergent features of perigastrulation development across species-for example, species-specific dependency on Hippo signalling during presomitic mesoderm differentiation-and provide an initial assessment of relevant stem cell models of human early organogenesis. This comprehensive single-cell transcriptome atlas not only fills the knowledge gap in the nonhuman primate research field but also serves as an invaluable resource for understanding human embryogenesis and developmental disorders."

Advances in single-cell genomics have provided unprecedented insights into deciphering molecular and cellular heterogeneity of biological systems. Despite substantial progress on deciphering the central dogma of gene expression, cell-extrinsic information such as intercellular ligand-receptor interaction is poorly explored at the single-cell level. Cells communicate with one another through ligand-receptor interactions. For example, T cell receptors (TCRs) on the surface of T cells can recognize and interact with the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs).1Davis M.M.

Here, we developed a modular viral display and delivery platform to decode ligand-receptor interactions, deliver cargos in target cells, and connect ligand-receptor interactions with cell state. We termed this technology lentiviral-mediated cell entry by engineered receptor-ligand interaction (ENTER), which can systematically deorphanize pairs of interactions including TCR-pMHC, antibody-antigen, costimulatory ligand-receptors, and B cell antigen-BCR. ENTER permits gene delivery in a receptor-specific manner, allowing for the selective modulation in antigen-specific T and B cells. We further combined ENTER with droplet-based single-cell genomics profiling (ENTER by RNA sequencing [ENTER-seq]) to measure antigen specificity, TCR repertoire, gene expression, and surface protein landscape in individual human primary T cells. To achieve ligand-receptor interaction between lentiviruses and host cells, we reasoned that a user-defined ligand can complement a viral envelope protein with disrupted native receptor binding while maintaining fusion ability (Figure 1A). We focused on vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), a widely used viral envelope protein that interacts with low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) on host cells.12Burns J.C. Friedmann T.

Thus, our platform reprograms the viral tropism to cell entry that is dependent on the interaction between user-defined ligand and paired host cell receptors. Next, we fused the GFP protein with viral structural proteins to track transient virus binding and entry into host cells. After optimization (STAR Methods), nucleocapsid protein (NC) GFP fusion was found to perform the best using CD19-scFv-displayed viruses and Raji cell model (Figures 1C and 1D). In addition, NC-GFP viruses displaying CD19-scFv can recognize and bind to primary CD19+ B cells from human blood. Similar to Raji B cells, 80% of activated human primary B cells were bound by NC-GFP-labeled CD19-scFv-displayed viruses, whereas 60% of naive B cells were GFP+ (Figure 1E). The discrepancy of binding of CD19-scFv viruses is likely due to the difference of CD19 expression between naive and activated B cells (Figures 1F and 1G). Moreover, CD19 surface expression was dramatically decreased after incubation of CD19-scFv viruses (Figure 1G). Based on viral binding and fusion assay (Figures S1A and S1B; STAR Methods), the reduction in surface CD19 is mostly resulting from binding/masking of CD19-scFv-displayed viruses rather than from fusion/internalization. Consistently, specific binding and cell entry were observed when employing other ligand-receptor interaction such as CD40 ligands (Figures S1C–S1E). The incorporation of ligand protein and fusogen on virion surfaces were confirmed using an immunocapture assay (Figures S1F and S1G). These results suggest that ENTER can capture a highly specific ligand-receptor interaction in a transient viral binding assay and is applicable to multiple categories of receptor-ligand interactions. To investigate if ENTER can capture pMHC-TCR interactions, we engineered viruses to display a single chain of MHC fused with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and covalently linked peptide (Figure 2A). We observed a high surface expression of HLA-A∗0201 (HLA-A2) when transfected into HEK293T HLA knockout cells, where all endogenous HLA class I alleles were knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 (Figure S2A; STAR Methods).Figure S2Specificity and sensitivity of ENTER in decoding interaction between TCR and pMHC, related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Flow cytometry analysis of HLA-A2 and B2M surface expression in wild-type HEK293T, HLA-KO HEK293T, and HLA-A2 reconstituted HLA-KO HEK293T cells.(B) Flow cytometry plots of CMV-pp65495–503-TCR T cells upon 2-h incubation of HLA-A2-peptide-displayed GFP viruses, followed by staining of PE-tetramers.

The highly specific binding of pMHC-displaying viruses into TCR-matching T cells highlights the generality of the ENTER platform to present diverse pMHC antigens. We further validated the specificity of our pMHC-displayed viruses by co-staining with tetramers (Figure S2B; STAR Methods). Additionally, we observed that the pp65495–503 tetramer intensity and CD3 surface expression are significantly decreased after co-incubation with viruses displaying pp65495–503 (Figure S2C), similar to the observation of CD19 on Raji B cells (Figure 1G). This result indicates that pMHC-displayed viruses specifically bind to and mask the TCR-CD3 complex, preventing later binding of pMHC tetramer and anti-CD3 antibody. We found that pMHC-displayed viruses are more sensitive compared with pMHC tetramers on a molar basis per reagent (Figure 2C; STAR Methods). In addition, by varying a broad range of affinity between pMHC and TCR interaction, ENTER is able to detect TCR affinity as low as 10.8 μM when adding high titer of viruses (40 ng p24) (Figure 2D). The TCR binding affinity is positively correlated with ENTER recognition efficiency, suggesting that ENTER may be applied to infer relative TCR affinity by measuring binding efficiency of pMHC-displayed viruses (Figure 2D). Finally, we assessed the specificity and sensitivity of our pMHC viral display platform, by mixing on-target T cells and off-target T cells at different ratios (Figures 2E and S2D; STAR Methods). The signal-to-noise ratio was over 150-fold, even when the frequency of on-target T cells is as low as 1 in 1,000, further demonstrating the high specificity and sensitivity of ENTER platform (Figures 2F, S2D, and S2E). B cells possess a high diversity of BCRs that can specifically target foreign antigens from invading viruses and self-antigens from our own body.18Briney B. Inderbitzin A. Joyce C. Burton D.R.

This is consistent with previous reports showing that ICAM1 is selectively acquired in budding viruses through interaction with viral matrix protein.20Jalaguier P. Cantin R. Maaroufi H. Tremblay M.J. Selective acquisition of host-derived ICAM-1 by HIV-1 is a matrix-dependent process.J.

The result showed that 88% of spike-RBD BCR+ B cells were labeled by RBD-displayed viruses, indicating that ENTER with optimized TMD can be applied to decode B cell specificity for both linear epitopes (HPV16 L217–36 antigens) and full antigen domains (SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD). Additionally, we showed that ENTER can decode B cell specificity toward native cell surface B cell antigens such as HER221Gutierrez C. Schiff R. HER2: biology, detection, and clinical implications.Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2011; 135: 55-62https://doi.org/10.5858/2010-0454-RAR.1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar (Figures S3A and S3B), highlighting the generalization of ENTER to display any B cell antigens from intracellular (HPV L2), extracellular (spike RBD), and cell surface proteins (HER2). Finally, mixing experiments showed high specificity and sensitivity of ENTER to decipher interactions between BCR and B cell antigens (Figures 3E and S3C). The signal-to-noise ratio was around 100- to 200-fold (Figure 3F), indicating a profound specificity and sensitivity of our TMD-optimized viruses to display B cell antigen epitopes (Figures S3D and S3E). We investigated if ENTER is capable to deliver cargos into antigen-specific T or B cells. By utilizing GFP transgene as a cargo to measure the delivery efficiency and specificity, wild-type VSV-G pseudotyped virus transduced cells irrespective of TCR or BCR specificity (Figure S3F). When pp65495–503 pMHC viruses were used to transduce on-target CMV-pp65 TCR+ T cells and off-target NY-ESO-1 TCR+ T cells (STAR Methods), we observed that 82% of on-target TCR-T cells express GFP, whereas only 0.22% of off-target TCR-T cells are GFP+ (Figures 4A and 4B ). Similarly, we showed specific delivery of GFP transgene in on-target HER2 BCR+ B cells but not in off-target RBD BCR+ B cells (Figures 4C and 4D). Next, we engineered pMHC-displayed viruses to carry herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene, a well-established suicide gene in response to the drug ganciclovir (GCV),22Beltinger C.

USA. 1999; 96: 8699-8704https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.15.8699Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar for targeted cell killing. After adding pp65495–503-displayed viruses carrying suicide gene to a mixture of CMV-pp65 TCR+ T cells and NY-ESO-1 TCR+ T cells, we observed a specific cargo delivery in on-target T cells (CMV-pp65 TCR+) (Figure S3G) and preferential depletion of on-target T cells compared with off-target T cells (Figures 4E and 4F). The killing was largely due to the specific delivery of suicide gene, when compared with GFP control cargo (Figure 4G). Likewise, HER2-displayed viruses delivered HSV-TK to specific HER2 BCR+ B cells in a mixture with RBD BCR+ B cells (Figures 4H and S3H), which resulted in efficient killing of targeted cells (Figures 4I and 4J). Our data suggest that ENTER enables selective depletion of one T or B cell clone among a pool of T or B cells by antigen-specific suicide gene delivery. Conversely, ENTER enables selective survival of antigen-specific T cells. We delivered short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against the cell death receptor FAS (shFAS) in antigen-specific T cells to prevent the FAS-induced programmed cell death23Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. A cell-killing monoclonal antibody (anti-Fas) to a cell surface antigen co-downregulated with the receptor of tumor necrosis factor.J. Exp.

A significant decrease of FAS protein surface expression was observed in on-target T cells infected with shFAS, compared with shCtrl group or off-target uninfected T cells, indicating a targeted shRNA delivery (Figure 4L). When challenged with FAS activation to induce apoptosis (Figures 4K and S3J; STAR Methods), we observed a significant increase of on-target T cells among live cells after FAS knockdown, compared with shCtrl group (Figure 4M). Altogether, our data show that ENTER permits targeted cargo delivery to manipulate complex cellular populations with ligand-receptor specificity. Given the unique feature of viral RNA that carries genetic information to encode surface-displayed ligand proteins, we combined ENTER platform with droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq to develop ENTER-seq. Specifically, we applied ENTER-seq to simultaneously map pMHC antigen specificity, TCR repertoire, and gene expression of T cells at the single-cell level (Figure 5A). To efficiently capture the MHC-peptide information on viral RNA in each droplet, we inserted a capture tag in the linker region between B2M and MHC, and another PCR handle next to the CMV promoter (Figure 5B). This capture tag allows capture by commercially available 5′ gel bead-in emulsions (GEM) beads through hybridizing with the template-switching oligo (TSO) sequence conjugated on the beads. The insertion of the capture tag and PCR handle does not affect the display of pMHC on viruses and specific interaction with TCR-expressing T cells (Figures S4A and S4B).Figure S4Optimize ENTER to detect antigen-specific primary human T cells, related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Flow cytometry analysis of GFP signal in T cells expressing TCRs (NY-ESO-1 TCR or CMV pp65-TCR) upon incubation with NY-ESO-1157–165 antigen peptide-displayed GFP viruses whose viral RNA are either intact or inserted with sequencing capture tag.(B) Bar plot showing the percentage of GFP+ cells from (A).(C) Schematic view of experimental design.

NIS couples the inward translocation of I− against its electrochemical gradient to the inward transport of Na+ down its electrochemical gradient1,2. For nearly 50 years before its molecular identification3, NIS was the molecule at the centre of the single most effective internal radiation cancer therapy: radioiodide (131I−) treatment for thyroid cancer2. Mutations in NIS cause congenital hypothyroidism, which must be treated immediately after birth to prevent stunted growth and cognitive deficiency2. Here we report three structures of rat NIS, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy: one with no substrates bound; one with two Na+ and one I− bound; and one with one Na+ and the oxyanion perrhenate bound. Structural analyses, functional characterization and computational studies show the substrate-binding sites and key residues for transport activity. Our results yield insights into how NIS selects, couples and translocates anions—thereby establishing a framework for understanding NIS function—and how it transports different substrates with different stoichiometries and releases substrates from its substrate-binding cavity into the cytosol. Mutations in the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) cause congenital hypothyroidism, and our results yield insights into how NIS selects, couples and translocates anions, thereby establishing a framework for understanding NIS function."
https://openalex.org/W4311436954,"Abstract Systems consolidation—a process for long-term memory stabilization—has been hypothesized to occur in two stages 1–4 . Whereas new memories require the hippocampus 5–9 , they become integrated into cortical networks over time 10–12 , making them independent of the hippocampus. How hippocampal–cortical dialogue precisely evolves during this and how cortical representations change in concert is unknown. Here, we use a skill learning task 13,14 to monitor the dynamics of cross-area coupling during non-rapid eye movement sleep along with changes in primary motor cortex (M1) representational stability. Our results indicate that precise cross-area coupling between hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and M1 can demarcate two distinct stages of processing. We specifically find that each animal demonstrates a sharp increase in prefrontal cortex and M1 sleep slow oscillation coupling with stabilization of performance. This sharp increase then predicts a drop in hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWR)–M1 slow oscillation coupling—suggesting feedback to inform hippocampal disengagement and transition to a second stage. Notably, the first stage shows significant increases in hippocampal SWR–M1 slow oscillation coupling in the post-training sleep and is closely associated with rapid learning and variability of the M1 low-dimensional manifold. Strikingly, even after consolidation, inducing new manifold exploration by changing task parameters re-engages hippocampal–M1 coupling. We thus find evidence for dynamic hippocampal–cortical dialogue associated with manifold exploration during learning and adaptation."

A molecular segmentation clock in the presomitic mesoderm sets the pace of somite formation4. However, how cells are primed to form a segment boundary at a specific location remains unclear. Here we developed precise reporters for the clock and double-phosphorylated Erk (ppErk) gradient in zebrafish. We show that the Her1-Her7 oscillator drives segmental commitment by periodically lowering ppErk, therefore projecting its oscillation onto the ppErk gradient. Pulsatile inhibition of the ppErk gradient can fully substitute for the role of the clock, and kinematic clock waves are dispensable for sequential segmentation. The clock functions upstream of ppErk, which in turn enables neighbouring cells to discretely establish somite boundaries in zebrafish5. Molecularly divergent clocks and morphogen gradients were identified in sequentially segmenting species3,4,6-8. Our findings imply that versatile clocks may establish sequential segmentation in diverse species provided that they inhibit gradients."
https://openalex.org/W4311472685,"Abstract Expansion of a single repetitive DNA sequence, termed a tandem repeat (TR), is known to cause more than 50 diseases 1,2 . However, repeat expansions are often not explored beyond neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. In some cancers, mutations accumulate in short tracts of TRs, a phenomenon termed microsatellite instability; however, larger repeat expansions have not been systematically analysed in cancer 3–8 . Here we identified TR expansions in 2,622 cancer genomes spanning 29 cancer types. In seven cancer types, we found 160 recurrent repeat expansions (rREs), most of which (155/160) were subtype specific. We found that rREs were non-uniformly distributed in the genome with enrichment near candidate cis -regulatory elements, suggesting a potential role in gene regulation. One rRE, a GAAA-repeat expansion, located near a regulatory element in the first intron of UGT2B7 was detected in 34% of renal cell carcinoma samples and was validated by long-read DNA sequencing. Moreover, in preliminary experiments, treating cells that harbour this rRE with a GAAA-targeting molecule led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation. Overall, our results suggest that rREs may be an important but unexplored source of genetic variation in human cancer, and we provide a comprehensive catalogue for further study."
https://openalex.org/W4311472768,"Old-growth tropical forests are widely recognized as being immensely important for their biodiversity and high biomass1. Conversely, logged tropical forests are usually characterized as degraded ecosystems2. However, whether logging results in a degradation in ecosystem functions is less clear: shifts in the strength and resilience of key ecosystem processes in large suites of species have rarely been assessed in an ecologically integrated and quantitative framework. Here we adopt an ecosystem energetics lens to gain new insight into the impacts of tropical forest disturbance on a key integrative aspect of ecological function: food pathways and community structure of birds and mammals. We focus on a gradient spanning old-growth and logged forests and oil palm plantations in Borneo. In logged forest there is a 2.5-fold increase in total resource consumption by both birds and mammals compared to that in old-growth forests, probably driven by greater resource accessibility and vegetation palatability. Most principal energetic pathways maintain high species diversity and redundancy, implying maintained resilience. Conversion of logged forest into oil palm plantation results in the collapse of most energetic pathways. Far from being degraded ecosystems, even heavily logged forests can be vibrant and diverse ecosystems with enhanced levels of ecological function."
https://openalex.org/W4311439067,"The ɸC31 integrase system is widely used in Drosophila melanogaster to allow transgene targeting to specific loci. Over the years, flies bearing any of more than 100 attP docking sites have been constructed. One popular docking site, termed attP40, is located close to the Nesprin-1 orthologue msp-300 and lies upstream of certain msp-300 isoforms and within the first intron of others. Here we show that attP40 causes larval muscle nuclear clustering, which is a phenotype also conferred by msp-300 mutations. We also show that flies bearing insertions within attP40 can exhibit decreased msp-300 transcript levels in third instar larvae. Finally, chromosomes carrying certain ""transgenic RNAi project"" (TRiP) insertions into attP40 can confer pupal or adult inviability or infertility, or dominant nuclear clustering effects in certain genetic backgrounds. These phenotypes do not require transcription from the insertions within attP40. These results demonstrate that attP40 and insertion derivatives act as msp-300 insertional mutations. These findings should be considered when interpreting data from attP40-bearing flies."

The present study aimed to develop and investigate the psychometric properties of the Bangla Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short-Form (IGDS9-SF), Gaming Disorder Test (GDT), and Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) due to a lack of existing sound psychometric tools in Bangladesh. Methods A cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey was carried out among 428 school-aged adolescents who were active gamers (90.89% males; Mean age : 16.13±1.85 years; age range: 10–19 years). Participants were recruited using convenience sampling across four selected schools in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Data collected included sociodemographic information, frequency of internet use and gaming behaviors, psychological states (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7]), disordered gaming and social media use (i.e., IGDS9-SF, GDT, and BSMAS). Psychometric testing was conducted to examine the validity and reliability levels of the Bangla IGDS9-SF, GDT, and BSMAS. Results The newly adapted Bangla IGDS9-SF, GDT, and BSMAS exhibited adequate levels of internal consistency. All total scores were significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, frequencies of internet use/online activities and gaming, supporting criterion and convergent validity. CFA indicated excellent construct validity as all instruments had a good fit to the data. Conclusions The findings suggest that the Bangla IGDS9-SF, GDT, and BSMAS are sound psychometric instruments due to their satisfactory psychometric properties including internal consistency, criterion validity, convergent validity, and construct validity."
https://openalex.org/W4311438961,"Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children <5 years globally. Early identification of hospitalized children with pneumonia who may fail antibiotics could improve outcomes. We conducted a secondary analysis from the Malawi CPAP IMPACT trial evaluating risk factors for antibiotic failure among children hospitalized with pneumonia.Participants were 1-59 months old with World Health Organization-defined severe pneumonia and hypoxemia, severe malnutrition, and/or HIV exposure/infection. All participants received intravenous antibiotics per standard care. First-line antibiotics were benzylpenicillin and gentamicin for five days. Study staff assessed patients for first-line antibiotic failure daily between days 3-6. When identified, patients failing antibiotics were switched to second-line ceftriaxone. Analyses excluded children receiving ceftriaxone and/or deceased by hospital day two. We compared characteristics between patients with and without treatment failure and fit multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate associations between treatment failure and admission characteristics.From June 2015-March 2018, 644 children were enrolled and 538 analyzed. Antibiotic failure was identified in 251 (46.7%) participants, and 19/251 (7.6%) died. Treatment failure occurred more frequently with severe malnutrition (50.2% (126/251) vs 28.2% (81/287), p<0.001) and amongst those dwelling ≥10km from a health facility (22.3% (56/251) vs 15.3% (44/287), p = 0.026). Severe malnutrition occurred more frequently among children living ≥10km from a health facility than those living <10km (49.0% (49/100) vs 35.7% (275/428), p = 0.014). Children with severe malnutrition (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.2 (95% CI 1.52, 3.24), p<0.001) and pre-hospital antibiotics ((aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01, 2.14), p = 0.043) had an elevated aOR for antibiotic treatment failure.Severe malnutrition and pre-hospital antibiotic use predicted antibiotic treatment failure in this high-risk severe pneumonia pediatric population in Malawi. Our findings suggest addressing complex sociomedical conditions like severe malnutrition and improving pneumonia etiology diagnostics will be key for better targeting interventions to improve childhood pneumonia outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4311472245,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression can be predicted by abnormalities in the tubulointerstitial lining, and their treatment may be useful for preventing the disease. DKD is a progressive disease that contributes to renal tubular cell death, but its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Ferroptosis is a novel term linked to lipid hydroperoxidation, and it plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DKD. Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), an enzyme of the proximal tubule, causes cellular redox damage in DKD. It remains unknown whether COX2 exacerbates tubular damage by accelerating ferroptosis in the kidneys of diabetic mice. HK-2 cells cultured in high glucose exhibited ferroptosis, which was inhibited by ferroptosis inhibitors. Additionally, alterations in the sensors of ferroptosis metabolism, such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity, lipid hydroperoxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and changes in mitochondrial morphology, were observed in high glucose-cultured HK-2 cells. Diabetic mice manifested tubular injury and deranged renal physiological indices, which were mitigated by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Importantly, these perturbations were ameliorated by downregulating COX2. In addition, the increased COX2 was observed to be elevated in the daibetic kindney. To explore the relevance of COX2 to ferroptosis, HK-2 cells that knocked down from COX2 exhibited decreased ferroptosis sensitivity under high glucose conditions. In RSL-3-treated HK-2 cells, ferroptosis was improved by downregulating COX2 by treatment with aspirin, which was confirmed in high glucose-cultured HK-2 cells. Furthermore, the ferroptosis changes were also suppressed by decreasing COX2 in diabetic mice treated with aspirin, which retarded DKD progression. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ferroptosis in renal tubular cells contributes to DKD development and that diabetes-related ferroptosis was inhibited through the downregulation of COX2 by aspirin, thus retarding the progression of DKD. Our findings support a renoprotective mechanism by which aspirin inhibits COX2 activation, identify COX2 as a potential target of ferroptosis, and establish that ferroptosis in renal tubular cells is an integral process in the pathogenesis of DKD regulated by COX2 expression profiles."
https://openalex.org/W4311472307,"Peer-assisted learning (PAL)–especially peer tutorials–are gaining momentum in health professions education, particularly in interprofessional education. As little is known about the use of peer tutorials or the preparation of tutors in this context in Germany and in other countries, this study aims to provide an overview of these interventions. A cross-sectional study with a descriptive-exploratory design was conducted. German institutions for health professions education were contacted, and individuals with pedagogical responsibilities were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey was informed by two studies in which seven domains were identified as important. These included facts about the institution, the offer of PAL, the use of tutorials, and the design of tutor training. The survey used mostly closed-ended questions. The questionnaire was completed by n = 100 participants. Overall, n = 46 participants indicated that PAL was offered at their institution. Of these 46 participants, 32 (70%) indicated that uniprofessional PAL was offered, 2 (4%) indicated that interprofessional PAL was offered, and 12 (26%) indicated that both forms of PAL were offered. Peer tutoring was the most common format in both cases (73% for uniprofessional and 64% for interprofessional PAL), and mandatory interventions were mostly used to prepare the tutors. These interventions were held by educators or lecturers and were offered mostly face-to-face as workshops or as discussions. Deepening the tutors’ social competencies through training was given high relevance. Regarding content, focus was placed on communication, (self-)reflection, and group management. Eighty-eight participants expressed recommendations for future directions in terms of preparing tutors for interprofessional PAL. Minor differences between the use of uniprofessional and interprofessional PAL and tutor training were found. Nevertheless, implementation strategies varied. In future, preparatory measures for tutors should be more uniformly designed and geared to the specific requirements of uniprofessional and interprofessional learning, and that at best on an empirical basis."
https://openalex.org/W4311472670,"Guiding many-body systems to desired states is a central challenge of modern quantum science, with applications from quantum computation to many-body physics and quantum-enhanced metrology. Approaches to solving this problem include step-by-step assembly, reservoir engineering to irreversibly pump towards a target state, and adiabatic evolution from a known initial state. Here we construct low-entropy quantum fluids of light in a Bose Hubbard circuit by combining particle-by-particle assembly and adiabatic preparation. We inject individual photons into a disordered lattice where the eigenstates are known & localized, then adiabatically remove this disorder, allowing quantum fluctuations to melt the photons into a fluid. Using our plat-form, we first benchmark this lattice melting technique by building and characterizing arbitrary single-particle-in-a-box states, then assemble multi-particle strongly correlated fluids. Inter-site entanglement measurements performed through single-site tomography indicate that the particles in the fluid delocalize, while two-body density correlation measurements demonstrate that they also avoid one another, revealing Friedel oscillations characteristic of a Tonks-Girardeau gas. This work opens new possibilities for preparation of topological and otherwise exotic phases of synthetic matter."
https://openalex.org/W4311438780,"Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) are critical effector receptors for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. On macrophages, FcγRs mediate multiple effector functions, including phagocytosis, but the individual contribution of specific FcγRs to phagocytosis has not been fully characterized. Primary human macrophage populations, such as splenic macrophages, can express FcγRI, FcγRIIA, and FcγRIIIA. However, there is currently no widely available monocyte or macrophage cell line expressing all these receptors. Common sources of monocytes for differentiation into macrophages, such as human peripheral blood monocytes and the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, generally lack the expression of FcγRIIIA (CD16A). Here, we utilized a lentiviral system to generate THP-1 cells stably expressing human FcγRIIIA (CD16F158). THP-1-CD16A cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 hours phagocytosed anti-D-opsonized human red blood cells primarily utilizing FcγRI with a lesser but significant contribution of IIIA while phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized human platelets equally utilized FcγRI and Fcγ IIIA. Despite the well-known ability of FcγRIIA to bind IgG in cell free systems, this receptor did not appear to be involved in either RBC or platelet phagocytosis. These transgenic cells may constitute a valuable tool for studying macrophage FcγR utilization and function."
https://openalex.org/W4311438950,"Healthy pregnancy requires a coordinated immune response, yet complications can arise, putting both the mother's and child's health at risk. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are pregnancy-related complications that account for most maternal morbidity and mortality. Cytokines are proteins released as part of the immune response to disease or infection and regulate inflammation. Certain pregnancy complications cause localized and systemic inflammation; however, cytokine profiles specific to such complications are not well understood. This study aims to examine associations between pregnancy complications of HDP and GDM and cytokine profiles in the second trimester of pregnancy. Data was obtained from the All Our Families birth cohort in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The cohort collected questionnaires at the time of participant enrollment and maternal blood samples at 17-23 weeks gestation. Cases of HDP (n = 27) and GDM (n = 31) were matched to controls on BMI, maternal age, and smoking status in the preconception period at a 1:3 ratio. Cytokine levels were measured in blood samples using Luminex xMAP technology using a panel of 42 cytokines. Using R software, a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was conducted to identify cytokine profiles and levels associated with each complication. Four cytokines were identified in the HDP CART (in descending order of importance): Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (cut-off: <480pg/mL), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1β (cut-off: ≥26pg/mL), Eotaxin (cut-off: <27/≥27&<36/≥36pg/mL), and Soluble Cluster of Differentiation 40 Ligand (cut-off: <1342pg/mL). Six cytokine levels were identified in the GDM CART: Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1Ra; cut-off: <25pg/mL), Interleukin-5 (cut-off: ≥0.4pg/mL), Interferon-γ (cut-off: <4.9pg/mL), IL-1Ra (cut-off: ≥111pg/mL), Eotaxin (cut-off: ≥21pg/mL), and Interleukin-18 (cut-off: ≥155pg/mL). By examining the complex inter-relationships between cytokines, findings of cytokine profiles guide further research in identifying biomarkers of pregnancy complications relevant to the design of the future management or prevention of these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4311439018,"The FWI is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem that traditionally uses local (derivative-based) minimization to find the scalar field of properties that best represents the field seismic data. This problem has a high computational cost and accuracy limited to local minima, in addition to suffering from a slow convergence rate (Cycle Skipping). Therefore, we developed a two-phase hybrid optimization algorithm based on DFO algorithms. The first use global minimization and clustering technique. The second use local minimization. In phase 1 we adopted the modified PSO and K-means algorithms and in phase 2, we adopted the ANMS. We call the hybrid algorithm of the PSO-Kmeans-ANMS. Where K-means is responsible for dividing swarms of particles into 2 clusters at every instant. This strategy aims to automatically balance the mechanisms of exploration and exploitation of the parameter search space by the hybrid algorithm, allowing one to find more precise solutions and consequently improving its convergence. The PSO-Kmeans-ANMS algorithm was validated on the set of 12 benchmark functions and applied to the FWI 1D problem. We compared PSO-Kmeans-ANMS with classic PSO, modified PSO, and ANMS algorithms. The metrics used were are the average execution time and the success rate (an error of ± 4% of the optimal solution). In all validation experiments and the FWI application, the PSO-Kmeans-ANMS performed well in terms of robustness and computational efficiency. In the case of FWI, there was a significant reduction in computational cost, thus presenting a relevant result."

In order to study the mechanical properties of white sandstone in deeply buried tunnels at high ground temperatures, materials suitable for conducting rockburst physical and mechanical tests were developed on the basis of the Daqian Shi Ling tunnel project, and similar material ratios were preferentially selected on the basis of white sandstone. Judged by the rock burst propensity, similar materials with low strength and high brittle characteristics, can better simulate the characteristics of white sandstone, and all show a strong propensity to rock burst, is the ideal rock burst similar materials. Uniaxial compressive tests were conducted on similar materials and the original rock at different temperatures, and comparative analysis was performed. Through the study of stress, displacement and modulus of elasticity, it was concluded that the compressive strength of similar materials gradually increased with temperature in the range of 20-100°C, and the vertical displacement at peak strength decreased with increasing temperature. The damage forms of white sandstone and similar materials at different temperatures were comparatively analyzed, and it was obtained that the damage forms of white sandstone and similar materials were basically the same, with a few specimens showing tensile and shear damage, and most specimens showing the form of combined tensile and shear damage. The study of rock burst similar materials and the development of the failure characteristics of rock burst under the action of thermal coupling are of great significance to the mechanism of rock burst generation and prediction."
https://openalex.org/W4311439137,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy affecting Chinese women, and early routine screening is incredibly important for its prevention and control. This study aimed to investigate the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in female breast cancer screening practices using the composite SES index.This cross-sectional study involved 1816 women in Eastern China. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire from January 2020 to May 2021. We used principal component analysis to construct the composite SES index using educational level, annual household income, and occupation. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between the SES index and breast cancer screening utilization.Of the participants, 19.27% reported having performed breast self-examination, 12.89% reported having undergone clinical breast examination, and 3.52% reported having received mammography. The SES has a significant influence on the patronage of female breast cancer screening in Eastern China. The composite SES index was found to have a positive and significant association with breast cancer screening practices. An interaction was found between the SES index and patient characteristics, such as health awareness, marital status, and location of residence. In addition, the SES index had a positive effect on breast cancer-related knowledge.Socioeconomic inequalities existed in Eastern China and were related to breast cancer screening patronage. The composite SES index was identified as a significant determinant of breast cancer screening practices. Our results highlighted the negative impacts of socioeconomic inequities on female breast cancer screening utilization. This suggests that reducing socioeconomic inequalities in breast cancer screening requires more focused interventions and concerted outreach activities for groups with lower education levels, lower income, or lower occupational classes."

https://openalex.org/W4311485939,"Racial identity and political partisanship have emerged as two important social correlates of hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. To examine the relationship of these factors with respondents' intention to vaccinate before the vaccine was available (November/December, 2020), we employed a multi-method approach: a survey experiment that randomized a vaccine-promotion message focused on racial equity in vaccine targeting, stepwise regression to identify predictors of hesitancy, and qualitative analysis of open-ended survey questions that capture how respondents reason about vaccination intentions. Experimental manipulation of a racial equity vaccine promotion message via an online survey experiment had no effect on intention-to-vaccinate in the full sample or in racial, ethnic and partisan subsamples. Descriptively, we find heightened hesitancy among non-Hispanic Black respondents (OR = 1.82, p<0.01), Hispanics (OR = 1.37, p<0.05), Trump voters (OR = 1.74, p<0.01) and non-Voters/vote Other (OR = 1.50, p<0.01) compared with non-Hispanic White respondents and Biden voters. Lower trust in institutions, individualism and alternative media use accounted for heightened hesitancy in Trump voters, but not non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. Older age and female gender identity also persistently predicted lower vaccine intentions. Qualitatively, we find that most hesitant responders wanted to 'wait-and-see,' driven by generalized concerns about the speed of vaccine development, and potential vaccine side-effects, but little mention of conspiracy theories. Identity appears to be an important driver of vaccinate hesitancy that is not fully explained by underlying socioeconomic or attitudinal factors; furthermore, hesitancy was not significantly affected by racial equity messages in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W4311486272,"According to previous clinical studies, the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is higher in men than women only during the reproductive age. Animal models of NAFLD that reflect sex differences in humans have not been established. In this study, we examined sex differences in the hepatic lesions of Tsumura Suzuki obese diabetes (TSOD) and db/db mice, which are representative genetic models of NAFLD. Male and female TSOD and db/db mice were fed with a normal diet and tap water ad libitum . Six male and female mice of each strain were sacrificed at the ages of 3 and 9 months, respectively, and serum biochemical, pathological, and molecular analyses were performed. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were significantly higher in male than female mice of both strains at the age of 3 months; however, at 9 months, significant sex differences were not observed. Similarly, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were significantly higher in male mice than in female TSOD mice at the age of 3 months; however, at 9 months, significant sex differences were not observed. Image analysis of histological slides revealed that the frequency of the steatotic area was significantly higher in male than female db/db mice at the age of 3 months; however, significant sex differences were not observed at 9 months. The frequency of Sirius red-positive fibrotic area was significantly higher in male than female mice in both strains at the age of 3 months; however, significant sex differences were not observed at 9 months. Serum AST and ALT levels and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in TSOD and db/db mice showed age-dependent sex differences consistent with those observed in human NAFLD. These mice may be suitable for studying sex differences of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W4311365490,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor in adults and harbors a subpopulation of glioma stem cells (GSCs). Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone lysine methyltransferase, deeply involves in the stemness maintenance of GSC. However, the precise mechanism and therapeutic potential remain elusive. We postulated that the interactome of EZH2 in GSC is unique. Therefore, we performed proteomic and transcriptomic research to unveil the oncogenic mechanism of EZH2. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify proteins that co-precipitate with EZH2. We show that EZH2 binds to heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (HP1BP3) in GSCs and impairs the methylation of H3K9. Overexpression of HP1BP3 enhances the proliferation, self-renewal and temozolomide (TMZ) resistance of GBM cells. Furthermore, EZH2 and HP1BP3 co-activate WNT7B expression thereby increasing TMZ resistance and stemness of GBM cells. Importantly, inhibition of WNT7B autocrine via LGK974 effectively reverses the TMZ resistance. Our work clarifies a new oncogenic mechanism of EZH2 by which it interacts with HP1BP3 and epigenetically activates WNT7B thereby promoting TMZ resistance in GSCs. Our results provide a rationale for targeting WNT/β-catenin pathway as a promising strategy to overcome TMZ resistance in GSCs."
https://openalex.org/W4311422700,"The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) p190RhoGAP (p190A) is encoded by ARHGAP35 which is found mutated in cancers. p190A is a negative regulator of the GTPase RhoA in cells and must be targeted to RhoA-dependent actin-based structures to fulfill its roles. We previously identified a functional region of p190A called the PLS (protrusion localization sequence) required for localization of p190A to lamellipodia but also for regulating the GAP activity of p190A. Additional effects of the PLS region on p190A localization and activity need further characterization. Here, we demonstrated that the PLS is required to target p190A to invadosomes. Cellular expression of a p190A construct devoid of the PLS (p190AΔPLS) favored RhoA inactivation in a stronger manner than WT p190A, suggesting that the PLS is an autoinhibitory domain of p190A GAP activity. To decipher this mechanism, we searched for PLS-interacting proteins using a two-hybrid screen. We found that the PLS can interact with p190A itself.

Altogether, our data unveil a new mechanism of p190A regulation. Small GTPases of the Rho family are molecular switches of key signaling pathways involved in cytoskeletal remodeling. A spatiotemporal regulation of Rho GTPases is required for achieving their key functions. For instance, efficient cell migration requires the sequential activation/inactivation of Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, to generate cycles of membrane protrusion (i.e., lamellipodia and filopodia) and adhesion site assembly (i.e., stress fibers) (1Machacek M.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of RhoA activity in migrating cells.Nature. 2006; 440: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). To this end, tight control of GTPase hydrolase activity is crucial, with one of the primary regulators of GDP/GTP cycling of Rho GTPases being GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). p190RhoGAP-A (also known as ARHGAP35 or GRLF1 and hereafter called p190A) is a GAP that acts on Rho GTPases. p190A plays important roles in actin regulatory pathways in numerous cell types and controls diverse cellular mechanisms, such as cell division, migration, and invasion, endothelial permeability, and cell death (4Héraud C. Pinault M. Lagrée V. Moreau V. p190RhoGAPs, the ARHGAP35- and ARHGAP5-encoded proteins, in health and disease.Cells. 2019; 8: 351Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of p190A is highly regulated to fulfill these specific functions. Thus, p190A accumulates in actin-rich structures, including new adhesion sites (5Tomar A. Lim S.T.

Parsons S.J. p190RhoGAP negatively regulates Rho activity at the cleavage furrow of mitotic cells.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 1347-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given the enzymatic activity of p190A enhances GTP hydrolysis, p190A is mainly involved in the attenuation of the biological function of RhoA GTPase. However, p190A may also function as a signal terminator for Rac1 and RhoC (4Héraud C. Pinault M. Lagrée V. Moreau V. p190RhoGAPs, the ARHGAP35- and ARHGAP5-encoded proteins, in health and disease.Cells. 2019; 8: 351Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). p190A is a large (≈1500 aa) multidomain protein with a C-terminal catalytic domain. In addition to this RhoGAP module, p190A contains three other structural domains. The N-terminal part of p190A harbors a GTP-binding domain (GBD), described recently as a class (ii) pseudo-GTPase domain, that is, a nucleotide-binding and catalytically inactive GTPase (11Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. The N-terminal GTPase domain of p190RhoGAP proteins is a PseudoGTPase.Structure. 2018; 26: 1451-1461.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). There are also four motifs, the so-called FF motifs, in proximity to the GBD. These consist of 50 aa with two strictly conserved phenylalanine residues. Finally, the large domain between the FF and GAP domains contains two class (i) pseudo-GTPase domains (pG1 and pG2) that harbor neither nucleotide-binding activity nor catalytic activity (12Stiegler A.L. Boggon T.J. p190RhoGAP proteins contain pseudoGTPase domains.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 506Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Besides these structural domains, several functional domains have been characterized in p190A. A binding site for p120RasGAP, a GAP of the Ras GTPases, was identified between the pG2 and the GAP domain. Two Src-phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Y1087 and Y1105) are involved in the regulation of this interaction (13Hu K.Q. Settleman J. Tandem SH2 binding sites mediate the RasGAP-RhoGAP interaction: a conformational mechanism for SH3 domain regulation.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Roof R.W.

Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7052-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we identified another functional region (residues 380–971), including two FF motifs, pG1 and pG2, implicated in the regulation of subcellular localization and function of p190A. This region, named protrusion localization sequence (PLS), is needed for the targeting of p190A to lamellipodia (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Whether the PLS is also required for targeting p190A to other actin-rich subcellular structures, such as invadosomes, remains to be explored. Importantly, we also previously showed that the PLS regulates the GAP activity of p190A (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A truncated protein devoid of the PLS (p190ΔPLS) exhibited an increased ability to constitutively bind active RhoA in comparison to the WT protein. How the PLS regulates p190A activity is unknown and is the focus of the present study. p190A recently regained attention after being found mutated in cancers. Several large-scale studies mapping somatic variants across thousands of tumors identified ARHGAP35—the gene encoding p190A–as a new major cancer gene (15Kandoth C. McLellan M.D. Vandin F. Ye K. Niu B. Lu C. et al.Mutational landscape and significance across 12 major cancer types.Nature. 2013; 502: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar, 16Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Mermel C.H.

ARHGAP35 appears mutated in approximately 2% of tumors and is found significantly mutated in endometrial tumors (14%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (5%), lung adenocarcinoma (3%), and head and neck cancer (3%) (16Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Mermel C.H. Robinson J.T. Garraway L.A. Golub T.R. et al.Discovery and saturation analysis of cancer genes across 21 tumour types.Nature. 2014; 505: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). Mutations in ARHGAP35 were further confirmed in a study having identified new driver genes in lung carcinogenesis (17Campbell J.D. Alexandrov A. Kim J. Wala J. Berger A.H. Pedamallu C.S. et al.Distinct patterns of somatic genome alterations in lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Most ARHGAP35 mutations are nonsense mutations and frameshift deletions/insertions supporting a tumor-suppressor role for p190A. Given the GAP domain of p190A is localized in the C-terminus, these mutations are expected to produce a nonfunctional protein without GAP activity, as we found for the R997∗ nonsense mutation (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Besides these mutations, many missense mutations have also been reported throughout the entire ARHGAP35 sequence. Despite some potentially having no effect on protein function, we have shown that some mutations localized in the PLS and pG2 domain have a strong effect on GAP activity and cell behavior (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, the S866F point mutation and the in-frame 865–870 deletion, when ectopically expressed in tumor cells, can induce an increase in GAP activity and alter directed motility of tumor cells (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is clear that the effects of such mutations require further investigation. Altogether, combining the identification and characterization of the PLS with the effects of the aforementioned missense mutations leads us to question if p190A could harbor an autoinhibitory folding (18Bidaud-Meynard A. Binamé F. Lagrée V. Moreau V. Regulation of Rho GTPase activity at the leading edge of migrating cells by p190RhoGAP.Small GTPases. 2019; 10: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Building on our previous results, we aimed to better characterize the involvement of the PLS domain in the regulation of p190A, that is, localization and function. Herein, we confirmed that p190A localizes to various different invadosome organizations, such as dots, rosettes, and linear invadosomes. We found that deletion of the PLS in p190A alters these localizations. Using a global approach and biochemical analyses, we demonstrated that the PLS interacts with a region in close proximity to the GAP domain. Our data thus are consistent with a specific folding of the molecule, involving the PLS and masking the GAP domain. We demonstrated that this interaction is lost upon introduction of S866F and Δ865–870 mutations, providing a molecular explanation to the gain of GAP function observed in cells expressing these mutants. Overall, our findings unveil a new mechanism involved in p190A regulation that identifies the PLS as an inhibitory domain responsible for masking the p190A functional domain. The PLS region (Fig. 1A), encompassing two FF motifs, pG1, and pG2, was previously described as a regulator of p190A GAP function and required for targeting p190A to the lamellipodia of migrating cells (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We analyzed the involvement of the PLS domain in the targeting of p190A to invadosomes. We first confirmed that endogenous p190A localized to different invadosome types regardless of invadosome organization and stimuli. Endogenous p190A was found in spreading Huh6 hepatoblastoma cells in both dot-like invadopodia (cells plated on glass) and linear invadosomes (cells plated on glass coated with type I collagen fibers) but also in v-Src–induced rosettes in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. S1A). We next analyzed the localization of several HA-tagged constructs to check whether the PLS domain is required for p190A localization to invadosomes. Similar to the full-length protein, we found that the PLS alone can localize to invadosomes in NIH-3T3 (Fig. 1, B and C) and Huh6 cells (Fig. S1B). On the contrary, the targeting of a p190AΔPLS mutant (p190A lacking the PLS domain) to invadosomes was strongly affected (Figs. 1, B and C and S1B). These new data confirmed the importance of the PLS in regulating the localization of p190A in addition to its GAP function.Figure 1The PLS is required for modulating p190A invadosome localization.

Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using the siRNA strategy, we depleted cortactin expression (Fig. S1C) and analyzed its impact on p190A localization (Fig. 1, D and E). As previously described (19Boateng L.R. Cortesio C.L. Huttenlocher A. Src-mediated phosphorylation of mammalian Abp1 (DBNL) regulates podosome rosette formation in transformed fibroblasts.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 1329-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), cortactin-deficient cells still formed invadosome rosettes, in a similar way to control cells. We found that endogenous p190A still localized to invadosomes, even if cortactin levels were strongly decreased in rosettes (Fig. 1, D and E). These data revealed that cortactin is not involved in the recruitment of p190A to invadosomes, which is in contrast to its recruitment to extending lamellipodia. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interacting proteins to understand how this PLS domain could regulate p190A. The PLS domain of p190A was used as a bait in a two-hybrid screen of a highly complex human placenta complementary DNA (cDNA) library (92.3 million interactions). Interestingly, p190A itself was identified as interacting with the PLS. Indeed, 35 clones from human p190A were identified (Table S1) corresponding to two distinct regions of p190A: (i) region 2H#1 (aa 208–418), overlapping the end of the GBD and the first two FF motifs in the N-terminal part of the molecule, and (ii) region 2H#2 (aa 1069–1231), localized in the C-terminal part of p190A (Fig. 2A).Figure 2PLS interacts with the Cter domain of p190A.

We used previously generated HA-tagged constructs (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar): HA-amino terminal (Nter, aa 1–533) overlapping region 2H#1, and HA-carboxy terminal (Cter, aa 1055–1513) overlapping region 2H#2 (Table S2) (Fig. 2A). Using coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) with anti-HA antibodies, as shown in Figure 2B, we observed a strong interaction between the PLS and the Cter domain of p190A. However, despite identifying the region 2H#1 in the two-hybrid screen, interaction between the Nter domain and the PLS was barely detectable (Fig. 2B). This weak interaction may be due to the low expression of the HA-Nter construct in HEK293T cells. To more precisely map the interacting domains of p190A in the N- and C-terminal parts, we performed co-IP experiments between the PLS and smaller p190A domains. Figure 2C revealed that while the PLS strongly interacted with the C-terminal domain of p190A, the interaction with the so-called p120-binding domain was reduced and the interaction with the GAP domain was almost absent. Among the domains tested in the N-terminal part of p190A, only a weak interaction between the PLS with the GBD and the four FF domains (4FF) was observed (Fig. 2C); no conclusion can be drawn for the two FF domains (2FF) as we were unable to detect 2FF expression. We then generated HA-tagged constructs corresponding to the two regions identified in the two-hybrid screen, that is, regions 2H#1 and 2H#2, and performed co-IPs with GFP-PLS. The 2H#2 region (HA-Cter2h) strongly interacted with the PLS, whereas no interaction with the 2H#1 region was detected (HA-Nter2h) (Fig. 2D). This finding indicated that the minimal region of p190A required for interaction with the PLS domain is between aa 1069 and 1231 in the Cter part. Overall, these results show an interaction between two distinct domains of p190A, involving the region close to the GAP domain and the PLS domain, suggesting thus an effect of this interaction on p190A function. In order to evaluate the involvement of the PLS in the regulation of p190A GAP activity, we analyzed F-actin organization as a read-out of Rho GTPase activity. Huh7 cells were previously used to identify the PLS domain (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and are highly sensitive to RhoGAP activity increase. Indeed, we found that overexpression of the HA-tagged Cter domain of p190A, containing the GAP domain, strongly affected F-actin organization. The majority of Huh7 cells exhibited long membrane protrusions with a decrease in spreading, the so-called dendritic-like phenotype (Fig. 3, A and B). We thus questioned whether coexpression of the PLS with the Cter domain could rescue this phenotype by interacting with the Cter domain. To investigate this, we expressed the GFP-tagged PLS domain in Huh7 cells either alone or in combination with the HA-tagged Cter. Expression of the PLS domain alone did not change Huh7 cell phenotype, whereas coexpression of the PLS domain with the Cter domain strongly reduced the dendritic-like phenotype observed with HA-Cter expression (Fig. 3, A and B). Some cells also harbored an intermediate phenotype under Cter and PLS domain coexpression, suggesting a partial rescue of the normal phenotype (Fig. 3B). Therefore, our data demonstrate that through its interaction with the Cter domain, the PLS is able to inhibit the GAP activity of p190A. Some amino acids localized in the C-terminal part and notably in the 2H#2 region of p190A have already been recognized as involved in the function and regulation of the protein. In fact, Y1087 and Y1105 were found implicated in p120RasGAP binding (13Hu K.Q. Settleman J. Tandem SH2 binding sites mediate the RasGAP-RhoGAP interaction: a conformational mechanism for SH3 domain regulation.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Roof R.W.

Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7052-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We attempted to check whether these amino acids could regulate or modulate the aforementioned interactions we demonstrated using phosphosite mutants. We introduced Y1105F, Y1087F, Y1087E, or Y1105E mutations by site-directed mutagenesis into the HA-Cter construct. We then performed co-IP experiments using these mutants and GFP-PLS (Fig. 4A). No change in the PLS/Cter interaction was observed using either the WT or mutated Cter domains. This result suggests that phosphorylation of these two specific residues is not implicated in the binding of the Cter domain with the PLS. We next considered whether phosphorylation was generally necessary for this interaction. Figure 4B shows that phosphatase treatment did not modify the interaction between the Cter and PLS domains, implying that phosphorylation is not involved in this molecular interaction.Figure 4Cancer-associated mutations in PLS abolish PLS/Cter interaction and increase PLS/Nter interaction.

Bidaud-Meynard A. Magnan L. Piquet L. Montibus B. Chabadel A. et al.Cancer-associated mutations in the protrusion-targeting region of p190RhoGAP impact tumor cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 214: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Given both mutations are localized within the PLS domain of p190A (Fig. 2A), we analyzed their effect on the PLS/Cter interaction. To do so, we introduced each mutation in the GFP-tagged PLS construct and monitored interaction with HA-tagged Cter by co-IP. Interestingly, we showed that introducing the S866F mutation or deleting the five amino acids (Δ865–870) in the PLS abolished the interaction of the PLS domain with the Cter region of p190A (Figs. 4C and S2). We further examined the effect of these mutations on the weak PLS/Nter interaction. Conversely, we found that both mutations increased the interaction between the Nter and the PLS domain (Fig. 4D). The same results were obtained when co-IP experiments were performed with the Nter2h corresponding to the 2H#1 region (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that both mutations could alter the conformation of p190A by modifying domain interactions. This would also imply that these mutations lead to the release of Cter and the PLS domain interaction, in turn unmasking the GAP domain and simultaneously increasing the interaction between the Nter part of p190A and the PLS. Herein, we confirmed that the PLS of p190A is an important functional domain of p190A. This PLS domain, encompassing two FF motifs, pG1, and pG2, was previously identified in a structure/function analysis as the PLS of p190A (6Binamé F. Bidaud-Meynard A. Magna"
https://openalex.org/W4311438826,"Monitoring shifts in vegetation composition over time is essential for tracking biodiversity changes and for designing ecosystem management strategies. In Australia, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) provides a continent-wide network of monitoring sites (AusPlots) that can be used to assess the shifts in vegetation composition and structure of Australian Major Vegetation Groups (MVGs). Here we use time-series site data to quantify the extent and rate of MVG shifts between repeat visits and to recommend the most appropriate sampling frequency for specific MVGs. The research area spans a ~1,500 km latitudinal gradient within south/central Australia from arid rangelands in the north to Mediterranean vegetation in the south. The standardized AusPlots protocol was employed to repeatedly survey 103 one-hectare plots, assessed between 2011 and 2019. Floristic and growth form dissimilarities between visits were calculated with distance metrics and then regressed against survey interval. Multivariate ordination was used to explore temporal floristic shifts. Rank-dominance curves were used to display variations in species' importance. Between repeated visits, sites exhibited high variability for all vegetation parameters and trajectories. However, several trends emerged: (a) Species composition moved away from baseline linearly with intervals between surveys. (b) The rate of species turnover was approximately double in communities that are herbaceous versus woody-dominated. (c) Species abundances and growth forms shift at different speeds. All floristic and structural metrics shifted between re-visits, with varying magnitude and speed, but herbaceous-dominated plots showed higher floristic dynamism. Although the expanse, logistics, and the short time between visits constrained our analysis and interpretation, our results suggest that shorter revisit intervals may be appropriate for herbaceous compared to woody systems to track change most efficiently."

Training for IUE is currently being performed in live mice as no artificial models allow simulations yet. This study aimed to develop an anatomically realistic 3D printed simulator to train IUE in mice. To this end, we created embryo models containing lateral ventricles. We coupled them to uterus models in six steps: (1) computed tomography imaging, (2) 3D model segmentation, (3) 3D model refinement, (4) mold creation to cast the actual model, (5) 3D mold printing, and (6) mold casting the molds with a mix of soft silicones to ensure the hardness and consistency of the uterus and embryo. The results showed that the simulator assembly successfully recreated the IUE. The compression test did not differ in the mechanical properties of the real embryo or in the required load for uterus displacement. Furthermore, more than 90% of the users approved the simulator as an introduction to IUE and considered that the simulator could help reduce the number of animals for training. Despite current limitations, our 3D simulator enabled a realistic experience for initial approximations to the IUE and is a real alternative for implementing the 3Rs. We are currently working on refining the model."

Previous studies have shown the interconnectedness of food insecurity, malnutrition, and poor HIV health by elucidating that having one of these conditions increases the likelihood and severity of having another. However, few studies have explored the linkages between agricultural practices, food security and nutrition for PLHIV, or how agricultural livelihood interventions may affect these domains. This study aimed to examine the mechanisms through which an agricultural livelihood intervention can positively or negatively affect agricultural practices, food security, and nutrition for PLHIV.From July 2012-August 2013, we interviewed participants with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) enrolled in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an agricultural livelihood and finance intervention to understand the mechanisms through which the intervention may have affected HIV health outcomes. The intervention included agricultural and finance training and a microfinance loan to purchase the MoneyMaker hip pump, a human-powered water pump, seeds, and other farming implements. A purposive sample of 45 intervention and a random subset of 9 control participants were interviewed at 12-month endline visit with a subset of 31 intervention participants interviewed longitudinally at both the 3- and 12-month visits. Transcripts were double coded using an inductive-deductive approach and analyzed for impacts of the intervention on agricultural practices, food security, and nutrition using analytic reports for each key theme.All intervention participants described improvements in agricultural practices and yields attributed to the intervention while many also described improvements in income; these changes in turn contributed to improved HIV health, including suppressed viral loads, and a few people noted improved immunologic parameters. Key mechanisms included the knowledge gained from agricultural training which led to improved yields and access to new markets. The use of the irrigation pump was also identified as an additional, lesser important mechanism. All intervention participants reported sustained improvements in food security and nutrition through increased yields and income from the sale of excess crops used to purchase food, and diversification of fresh fruits and vegetables consumed through agricultural production. This led to self-reported weight gain which was a nutritional mechanism towards improved health.Agricultural and finance interventions that improve farming practices could lead to improved health outcomes through the pathways of improved food security, income, and diversified diet. The results from this study helped the team to enhance the intervention prior to implementation of the larger cluster RCT (cRCT). By understanding how agricultural livelihood interventions act upon pathways towards improved health, policy options can be developed and implemented to include components that are needed to achieve sustainable outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01548599."

Still, the existing methods based on deep learning are poor at detecting too long or too short JavaScript code. Based on this, this paper proposes an adaptive code length deep learning network JACLNet, composed of convolutional block RDCNet, BiLSTM and Transfrom, to capture the association features of the variable distance between codes. Firstly, an abstract syntax tree recombination algorithm is designed to provide rich syntax information for feature extraction. Secondly, a deep residual convolution block network (RDCNet) is designed to capture short-distance association features between codes. Finally, this paper proposes a JACLNet network for JavaScript malicious code detection. To verify that the model presented in this paper can effectively detect variable JavaScript code, we divide the datasets used in this paper into long text dataset DB_Long; short text dataset DB_Short, original dataset DB_Or and enhanced dataset DB_Re. In DB_Long, our method’s F 1 − score is 98.87%, higher than that of JSContana by 2.52%. In DB_Short, our method’s F 1- score is 97.32%, higher than that of JSContana by 7.79%. To verify that the abstract syntax tree recombination algorithm proposed in this paper can provide rich syntax information for subsequent models, we conduct comparative experiments on DB_Or and DB_Re. In DPCNN+BiLSTM, F 1- score with abstract syntax tree recombination increased by 1.72%, and in JSContana, F 1- score with abstract syntax tree recombination increased by 1.50%. F 1- score with abstract syntax tree recombination in JACNet improved by 1.00% otherwise unused."

This study aimed to fill in knowledge gaps on quality of nutrition service provision at public primary health care facilities in urban Dhaka.This cross-sectional study was conducted from April-July 2019 in Dhaka City. Fifty-three health facilities were sampled following NetCode protocol. Quality of nutrition services was assessed in terms of structural readiness, process, and client satisfaction. Structural readiness included equipment, guidelines, and registers, and knowledge of health professionals (n = 130). For process, client provider interaction was observed (ANC: n = 159, Pediatric: n = 150). For outcome assessment, client's satisfaction with nutrition service provision was measured through interviews with pregnant women (n = 165) and caregivers of 0-24 month-old children (n = 162). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using SPSS.There were gaps in availability of equipment and guidelines in health facilities. Only 30% of healthcare providers received basic nutrition training. The mean knowledge score was 5.8 (range 0-10) among ANC providers and 7.8 for pediatric service providers. Process: Only 17.6% health facilities had dedicated space for counselling, 48.4% of pregnant women received four key nutrition services; 22.6% of children had adequate growth monitoring; and 38.7% of caregivers received counselling on exclusive breastfeeding. Outcome: The mean satisfaction with services was 4.3 for ANC and 4.0 for paediatric visits (range 1-5). Participants attending public facilities had significantly lower satisfaction compared to those attending private and NGO health facilities.There were gaps in facility readiness, and implementation of nutrition services. The clients were more satisfied with services at private facilities compared to public. The gaps in nutrition service delivery need to be adequately addressed to ensure promotion of good nutrition and early detection and management of malnutrition among pregnant women and children in urban Bangladesh."

Community-based breeding programme (CBBP) has gained attention as a promising method for the genetic improvement of livestock but lacks information on donkey breeding. The study was conducted to identify donkey farmers’ breeding practices and donkey morphological characterization in three purposely selected villages (Thorne, Archibalt and Genau) located in Blouberg Local Municipality, Limpopo province of South Africa. Questionnaire survey method was used to collect the data from twenty-one donkey farmers while body weight and seventeen morphological traits were measured for the morphological characterization from seventy-four donkeys. Descriptive statistics and index values were computed to describe donkey breeding practices. Chi-square statistics were used to compare categorical variables among villages. General Linear Model procedure was used to compare morphological characteristics of donkeys among villages. The results revealed that there was no statistical different (P&gt;0.05) observed on socio-economic characteristics of donkey farmers except on education level (P&lt;0.05) among villages. Purpose of keeping donkeys, type of donkey breed kept, donkey coat colours, mating systems, reasons for culling, mating seasons and selection criterions were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05) among villages. The most common trait preferences of donkey farmers among the surveyed villages were body size and growth rate in breeding males while in breeding females were body size, twining ability and mothering ability. The results indicated that in all the eighteen measured traits only four showed a significant difference (P&lt;0.05) among the villages and some were significantly correlated with body weight (P&lt;0.05).

However, in many countries, the quality of medical-legal documentation is severely limited. MediCapt is an innovative digital application that enables clinicians to document forensic medical evidence as well as capture and securely store forensic photographs of injuries. This study evaluated the effectiveness and usability of MediCapt to document forensic medical evidence of sexual violence.This mixed-methods evaluation involved key-informant interviews, usability questionnaires, and forensic record reviews. Participants included clinicians, medical records personnel, information technology personnel, and health facility administrators, as well as law enforcement and legal professionals in Kenya.The Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) data quality checklist found that using MediCapt led to significantly higher data-quality scores compared to paper-based forms. MediCapt forms scored higher on 23 of 26 checklist items. While a wide difference in quality was seen among paper-based forms, MediCapt appeared to both standardize and improve quality of documentation across sites. MediCapt strengths included data security and confidentiality, accuracy and efficiency, and supplemental documentation with photography. Weaknesses included infrastructure challenges, required technological proficiencies, and time to learn the new system. Although it is early to assess the impact of MediCapt on prosecutions, providers and law and justice sector professionals were optimistic about its usefulness. They identified MediCapt as appropriate for use with survivors of sexual violence and reported MediCapt's legibility and photography features had already been commended by the court.MediCapt was well-received across all sectors, its use was perceived as feasible and sustainable, and it significantly improved the quality of collected forensic data. It is anticipated this improvement in forensic documentation will increase successful prosecutions, strengthen accountability for perpetrators, and improve justice for survivors."

Given past evidence of poor engagement with telemental health among men, this mixed-methods study examined Australian men's use of, and experiences with telemental health services relative to face-to-face care during the pandemic. A community sample of Australian-based men (N = 387; age M = 47.5 years, SD = 15.0 years) were recruited via Facebook advertising, and completed an online survey comprising quantitative items and open-response qualitative questions with the aim of better understanding men's experiences with telemental healthcare services. In total, 62.3% (n = 241) of participants reported experience with telemental health, and regression analyses revealed those who engaged with telemental health were on average younger, more likely to be gay and university educated. Men who had used telemental health were, on average, more satisfied with their therapy experience than those who had face-to-face therapy. Among those who had telemental healthcare, marginally lower satisfaction was observed among regional/rural based relative to urban men, and those who had to wait longer than 2 months to commence therapy. Qualitative findings highlighted positive aspects of telemental healthcare including comfort with accessing therapy from familiar home environments and the convenience and accessibility of telemental health alongside competing commitments and COVID-19 restrictions. Conversely, drawbacks included technical limitations such as crosstalk impeding therapeutic progress, disconnects and audio-visual lag-times and the 'impersonal' nature of telemental healthcare services.

The purpose of this study was to assess the true incidence of DVT after ACL reconstruction, regardless of symptom manifestation.Medical records of 260 patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstruction between January 2014 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Regardless of symptom manifestation, DVT was examined for all patients at 1 week postoperatively using ultrasonography. Demographics, injury mechanism (high energy direct injury and low energy indirect injury), soft tissue injury, preoperative anterior laxity, tourniquet time, and surgical technique (transtibial, anteromedial portal, and outside-in techniques) were investigated. Soft tissue injury was evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, based on the Tscherne classification. Risk factors for proximal DVT were identified using logistic regression analyses.A total of 21 (8.1%) patients showed DVT. 5 (1.9%) patients had thrombosis at the popliteal vein; however, none of them exhibited symptoms. The other 16 patients had thrombosis at the distal veins: 1 patient at the anterior tibial vein, 5 patients at the posterior tibial vein, 3 patients at the peroneal vein, 6 patients at the soleal vein, and 1 patient at the muscular branch vein. The risk factors for proximal DVT included high energy direct injury (p = 0.013, odds ratio = 10.62) and grade 2 soft tissue injury (p = 0.039, odds ratio = 6.78).The true incidence of DVT, including symptomatic and asymptomatic complications, were 8.1% after ACL reconstruction.

https://openalex.org/W4311472147,"Introduction Skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her new-born baby after birth is beneficial for both the mother and her baby. Although mother-newborn skin-to-skin contact after birth is an essential practice, it is limited to a small proportion of premature babies in low-income countries including Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess the practice of early mother-new-born skin-to-skin contact after the delivery of healthy term neonates and associated factors among health care professionals in Southwestern Oromia, Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the practice of 286 health care practitioners towards early mother-new-born skin-to-skin contact after delivery. Data was collected using a pre-tested observational checklist and a self-administered questionnaire from March to April 2017. Epi Info 3.5 was used for data entry, while SPSS version 20 was used for cleaning and analyzing the data. To determine the association between outcome variable and independent variables, bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used with a 95% confidence interval and P &lt;0.05. Frequency tables and charts were used to present the findings. Results Only 128 (44.8%) of the study participants practiced mother-newborn skin-to-skin contact within the first hour of life after birth. Mother newborn skin-to-skin contact after birth was found to be significantly associated with health professional’s knowledge (AOR = 4, 95% CI = 1.7, 10), training (AOR = 7, 95% CI = 2.2, 21), complicated delivery (AOR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.4), and maternal chronic illness (AOR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.6). Conclusion In general, the practice of health care providers on mother-newborn skin-to-skin contact in the first one hour after birth was low. Knowledge, training, childbirth related maternal complication, and maternal chronic illness were significant factors associated with the practice of mother-newborn skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth. Policies should be revised and enforced, with monitoring and awareness building through training among health care workers, to improve the practice of skin-to-skin contact between mothers and newborns shortly after birth."
https://openalex.org/W4311472161,"Okra is grown globally for its nutritional and economic benefits. Okra seeds ensure continuous production of the crop but challenges of poor production, adaptability and management may not allow the seeds to express their full potential. There are two seed production systems in Cameroon; the informal and formal. In Buea, the informal seed system is used by most farmers for seed production/utilization and farmers are reluctant to use hybrid seeds. This study aimed to assess the informal seed system of okra and evaluate the adaptability of seed produce from informal and formal systems in Buea. A survey and a field experiment were carried out. The designs for the survey and field experiment were stratified random sampling and randomized complete block design respectively. Data collection for the survey was done using questionnaires and other data collection instruments, while for the field experiment, data was collected on germination, vegetative growth parameters, incidence and severity of pests / diseases and yield. Data analysis for the survey was done using descriptive statistics, while data from the field experiment was done using a two-way ANOVA test and treatment means compared using the Tukey test at 5% probability. Results from the survey showed that women (60%) were mostly involved in seed production by mass selection from two landraces identified. Preservation of seeds was mostly done with the use of wood ash (58%) and insects were the major postharvest pest (76%). For the field experiment, at 66 DAP, Yellen recorded the highest significant number of leaves (13.417), leaf area (771.4 cm 2 ) and the number of branches (5.64). Clemson spineless recorded the highest significant incidence (89.9%) and severity for pests / diseases while Kirikou and Landrace recorded the least incidence (0.0%) and severity. Kirikou recorded the highest significant yield (6.0 tons/ha), followed by Landrace (5.3 tons/ha). These findings reveal the performance of the landrace and provide reasons why farmers in Buea are reluctant to use hybrid okra seeds. The Landrace should certainly have adaptable genes, coupled with the autogamous nature of okra which encourages inbreeding for homozygous traits, which are dominant in expression compared to heterozygous traits."

The reproduction of results regarding miRNA expression levels could be difficult if there are differences in the data acquisition process. Previous studies have shown that the anticoagulant type used during plasma preparation and sample storage conditions could contribute to differences in measured miRNA levels. Thus, the impact of these preanalytical conditions on comprehensive miRNA expression profiles was examined. First, the miRNA expression profiles of samples obtained from healthy volunteers were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Based on an analysis of the library concentration, human genome identification rate, ratio of unique sequences and expression profiles, the optimal preanalytical conditions for obtaining highly reproducible miRNA expression profiles were established. The optimal preanalytical conditions were as follows: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the anticoagulant, whole-blood storage at room temperature within 6 hours, and plasma storage at 4°C or -20°C within 30 days. Next, plasma samples were collected from 60 cancer patients (3 facilities × 20 patients/facility), and miRNA expression profiles were analyzed. There were no significant differences in measurements except in the expression of erythrocyte-derived hsa-miR-451a. However, the variation in hsa-miR-451a levels was smaller among facilities than among individuals. This finding suggests that samples obtained from the same facility could show significantly different degrees of hemolysis across individuals. We found that the standardization of anticoagulant use and storage conditions contributed to reducing the variation in sample quality across facilities. The findings from this study could be useful in developing protocols for collecting samples from multiple facilities for cancer screening tests."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and high MW rates have been reported in patients with PD. Thus, the present study sought to identify the factors that cause MW in patients with PD. We examined the frequency of MW in patients with PD and investigated the area of the brain where such frequency inversely correlates with reduced regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (rCMRglc). We also examined whether this area satisfied the motor and visual monitoring hypotheses of MW that have been presented in previous studies. Thirty-six subjects with idiopathic PD and 23 healthy controls were included in the study. We asked the participants to write down words, numerals, and sentences from left to right using their dominant and non-dominant hands. Patients with PD underwent an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan to measure the rCMRglc. Neither the patients with PD nor the healthy subjects exhibited MW in the use of the right hand. In the use of the left hand, MW occurred in 15 of the 36 patients with PD, but in none of the healthy controls. The right intraparietal sulcus was identified as the area where rCMRglc was inversely correlated with the number of left-right reversed characters. Previous functional imaging studies have suggested that the right superior parietal cortex and intraparietal sulcus play an important role in recognizing left-right reversed letters. Therefore, dysfunction in the intraparietal sulcus may hinder the recognition of left-right reversed characters, resulting in MW. Consequently, our findings in patients with PD are consistent with the visual-monitoring hypothesis of MW."
https://openalex.org/W4311486265,"The causes of reading difficulties in people with peripheral visual field loss are not fully understood. We conducted a two-dimensional gaze analysis on eye movements during reading in patients with retinitis pigmentosa to investigate the causes of reading difficulties in relation to the central visual field using a binocular eye mark recorder (EMR-9). Twenty-seven patients with retinitis pigmentosa whose central visual field narrowed to ≤ 20° using Goldmann kinetic perimetry (I/4 target) and this present study included eight healthy participants. The participants' visual acuities were corrected to better than +0.4 logMAR. Correlations and multivariate regression analyses were investigated between the number of letters read correctly, the I/4 central visual field, V/4 perifoveal and peripheral visual field, and visual acuity. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that all these parameters played almost equal roles in the number of letters read correctly. In the two-dimensional gaze analysis, the task performance time of patients during reading increased as the I/4 central visual field narrowed. The task performance time was more clearly correlated with the rotation saccade (r = 0.428, p <0.05) and the distance of the vertical direction (ΣY) of eye movements (r = 0.624, p < 0.01), but not with regressive saccade and the distance of the horizontal direction (ΣX). Visual acuity was correlated with the task performance time (-0.436, <0.05) but not with eye movement directionality. Reading difficulties in patients with retinitis pigmentosa result from impaired eye movement directionality. Understanding eye measurements for people with tunnel vision required a two-dimensional gaze analysis. The two-dimensional gaze analysis also showed that the involvement of the perifoveal and peripheral visual fields, visual acuity, and I/4 central visual field was important for reading in people with tunnel vision."
https://openalex.org/W4311486288,"Background T2D is an increasingly common disease that is associated with worse outcomes in patients with heart failure. Despite this, no contemporary study has assessed its impact on heart transplantation outcomes. This paper examines the demographics and outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) undergoing heart transplantation. Methods Using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, patients listed for transplant were separated into cohorts based on history of T2D. Demographics and comorbidities were compared, and cox regressions were used to examine outcomes. Results Between January 1 st , 2011 and June 12 th , 2020, we identified 9,086 patients with T2D and 23,676 without T2D listed for transplant. The proportion of patients with T2D increased from 25.2% to 27.9% between 2011 and 2020. Patients with T2D were older, more likely to be male, less likely to be White, and more likely to pay with public insurance (p&lt;0.001, all). After adjustment, T2D patients had a lower likelihood of transplantation (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.93, CI: 0.90–0.96, p&lt;0.001) and a higher likelihood of post-transplant mortality (HR: 1.30, CI: 1.20–1.40, p&lt;0.001). Patients with T2D were more likely to be transplanted in the new allocation system compared to the old allocation system (all, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Over the last ten years, the proportion of heart transplant recipients with T2D has increased. These patients are more likely to be from traditionally underserved populations. Patients with T2D have a lower likelihood of transplantation and a higher likelihood of post-transplant mortality. After the allocation system change, likelihood of transplantation has improved for patients with T2D."
https://openalex.org/W4311486340,"Low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate amount of the global burden of disease from emergency conditions. To improve the provision of emergency care in low-resource settings, a multifaceted World Health Organization (WHO) intervention introduced a toolkit including Basic Emergency Care training, resuscitation area guidelines, a trauma registry, a trauma checklist, and triage tool in two public hospital sites in Uganda. While introduction of the toolkit revealed a large reduction in the case fatality rate of patients, little is known about the cost-effectiveness and affordability. We analysed the cost-effectiveness of the toolkit and conducted a budget analysis to estimate the impact of scale up to all regional referral hospitals for the national level.A decision tree model was constructed to assess pre- and post-intervention groups from a societal perspective. Data regarding mortality were drawn from WHO quality improvement reports captured at two public hospitals in Uganda from 2016-2017. Cost data were drawn from project budgets and included direct costs of the implementation of the intervention, and direct costs of clinical care for patients with disability. Development costs were not included. Parameter uncertainty was assessed using both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Our model estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of implementing the WHO emergency care toolkit measuring all costs and outcomes as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) over a lifetime, discounting both costs and outcomes at 3.5%.Implementation of the WHO Toolkit averted 1,498 DALYs when compared to standard care over a one-year time horizon. The initial investment of $5,873 saved 34 lives (637 life years) and avoided $1,670,689 in downstream societal costs, resulted in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, dominating the comparator scenario of no intervention. This would increase to saving 884 lives and 25,236 DALYs annually with national scale up. If scaled to a national level the total intervention cost over period of five years would be $4,562,588 or a 0.09% increase of the total health budget for Uganda. The economic gains are estimated to be $29,880,949 USD, the equivalent of a 655% return on investment. The model was most sensitive to average annual cash income, discount rate and frequency survivor is a road-traffic incident survivor, but was robust for all other parameters.Improving emergency care using the WHO Toolkit produces a cost-savings in a low-resource setting such as Uganda. In alignment with the growing body of literature highlighting the value of systematizing emergency care, our findings suggest the toolkit could be an efficient approach to strengthening emergency care systems."
