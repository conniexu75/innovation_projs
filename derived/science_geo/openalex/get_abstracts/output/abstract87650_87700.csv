https://openalex.org/W2038218774,"Transcriptional enhancers, originally discovered in viral genomes, are short, cis-acting, regulatory sequences that strongly stimulate transcription from promoters of nearby genes. We demonstrate the existence of an enhancer within a mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. A DNA fragment located between the joining region and the switch recombination region in the intron upstream of the immunoglobulin μ constant region has been linked, in both orientations, to genes coding for rabbit β-globin or SV40 T antigen. This element enhances the number of correct β-globin gene transcripts by at least two orders of magnitude and also stimulates production of T antigen. It acts from several hundred to several thousand base pairs up or downstream of a promoter without amplifying template copy number. Of the various cell lines tested, the immunoglobulin gene enhancer functions only in lymphocyte-derived (myeloma) cells. We propose that this tissue-specific enhancer contributes to the activation of somatically rearranged immunoglobulin variable region genes and possibly to abnormal expression of other genes (e.g. c-myc) that become translocated to its domain of influence."
https://openalex.org/W2057893650,"We have studied the DNA sequences required for high level expression of a cloned heavy chain immunoglobulin gene stably introduced into mouse myeloma cells by DNA transfection. We found that DNA sequences derived from the germ line JH-C mu region are required for accurate and efficient transcription from a functionally rearranged VH promoter. Similar to viral transcriptional enhancer elements, these cellular sequences stimulate transcription from either the homologous VH gene segment promoter or a heterologous SV40 promoter. They are active when placed on the 5' or 3' side of the rearranged VH gene segment and they function when their orientation is reversed. However, unlike viral enhancers, the Ig gene enhancer appears to act in a tissue-specific manner, since it is active in mouse B cells but not in mouse fibroblasts. The nucleotide sequence of the Ig enhancer region contains repeating elements that closely resemble sequence the possible role of tissue-specific transcription in cell differentiation and malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2053572117,"To examine the DNA sequences involved in regulation of kappa immunoglobulin gene expression, an assay was developed whereby transcription of a cloned, rearranged kappa gene could be detected following its transfection into antibody-secreting mouse myeloma cells. In a transient expression assay, RNA transcripts initiating 20 to 25 bp before the AUG translation initiator of the kappa gene were readily detected. The constant region (C kappa) and part of the J kappa-C kappa intron was then deleted from the rearranged gene and a downstream SV40 polyadenylylation signal was provided. No transcription was detected from the deleted gene upon transfection into myeloma cells, suggesting that after rearrangement the kappa variable region promoter is activated by sequences more than 2.6 kb downstream of J kappa. The rearranged kappa gene was also transfected into a nonlymphoid line of monkey cells and RNA transcripts were detected. Transcription in these cells, however, was at a relatively lower level than in myeloma cells, did not depend on the presence of downstream sequences, and initiated from a site about 10 bp downstream of the myeloma site. These experiments define a sequence downstream of the promoter that is necessary for accurate transcription of the kappa chain gene."

https://openalex.org/W343065178,"We have constructed a recombinant bacterial library containing cDNA prepared from mRNA of adipose 3T3 cells. We have screened this library by several methods and isolated colonies containing sequences complementary to mRNAs for glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, two other major differentiation-dependent proteins of Mr = 28,000 and 13,000, and actin. These recombinants were identified by hybrid selection of total adipocyte mRNA, translation in vitro and subsequent immunoprecipitation, and two-dimensional electrophoresis of translated proteins. Three of the four cloned cDNAs hybridized to single adipocyte mRNA species of size close to that expected from the size of the polypeptide it specifies, but the mRNA for glycerophosphate dehydrogenase contained 3,550 bases, far larger than necessary to code for its polypeptide (Mr = 34,000). The increase in amount of mRNA during differentiation was 150-fold for the protein of Mr = 13,000 and considerably greater for glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and the protein of Mr = 28,000. The time course of mRNA accumulation was different for each of these mRNAs, indicating they do not respond synchronously during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2013545198,"Angiographically demonstrable coronary artery spasm could be provoked repeatedly by giving intracoronary or intravenous injections of histamine to miniature swine with experimentally induced atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary artery. The spasm induced in this way subsided either spontaneously or after the administration of nitroglycerin and was prevented by a calcium antagonist or an agent that blocks histamine H1 receptors. This model, which suggests that atherosclerotic changes may be one of the primary factors in the occurrence of coronary artery spasm, should facilitate studies on the pathogenesis of this condition."
https://openalex.org/W1606871094,"Enkephalin convertase, an enkephalin-synthesizing carboxypeptidase present in adrenal medulla chromaffin granules, has also been detected in brain and pituitary. To determine whether these three carboxypeptidase activities represent the same enzyme, we purified and characterized enkephalin convertase from adrenal medulla, whole brain, and whole pituitary. Enzyme from all three tissues co-purifies on DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration, concanavalin A, and L-arginine affinity columns, resulting in a 135,000-fold, 110,000-fold, and 2,800-fold purification for bovine adrenal medulla, brain, and pituitary, respectively. Purified enkephalin convertase appears homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showing a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 for enzyme isolated from all three tissues. Adrenal, brain, and pituitary enkephalin convertase are similarly inhibited by hexapeptide enkephalin precursors and active site-directed inhibitors. Both [Met]-and [Leu]enkephalin-Arg6 inhibit enkephalin convertase with Ki values between 50 and 80 microM, while [Met]-and [Leu]enkephalin-Lys6 are 3-fold less potent. Two active site-directed inhibitors, guanidinopropylsuccinic acid and guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, are potent inhibitors of all three enzymes with Ki values of 8-9 nM. A series of dansylated di-, tri-, and tetrapeptide substrates are hydrolyzed by enkephalin convertase with similar kinetic properties (Km, Vmax, and Kcat/Km) for the three enzymes. This evidence suggests that enkephalin convertase activity represents the same enzyme in adrenal medulla, brain, and pituitary. Enkephalin convertase may be involved in the production of other peptide neurotransmitters and hormones besides enkephalin."
https://openalex.org/W1560338125,"The biosynthesis and carbohydrate processing of the insulin receptor were studied in cultured human lymphocytes by means of metabolic and cell surface labeling, immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor autoantibodies, and analysis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. In addition to the two major subunits of Mr = 135,000 and Mr = 95,000, two higher molecular weight bands were detected of Mr = 210,000 and Mr = 190,000. The Mr = 210,000 band and the two major subunits were labeled by [3H]mannose, [3H]glucosamine, [3H]galactose, and [3H]fucose, and were bound by immobilized lentil, wheat germ, and ricin I lectins. On the other hand, the Mr = 190,000 band was labeled only by [3H]mannose and [3H]glucosamine and was bound only by lentil lectin. All four components could be labeled with [35S] methionine; however, in contrast with the other three polypeptides, the Mr = 190,000 band was not labeled by cell surface iodination with lactoperoxidase, suggesting that it is not exposed at the outer surface of the plasma membrane. Pulse-chase studies with [3H]mannose showed that the Mr = 190,000 was the earliest labeled component of the receptor; radioactivity in this band reached a maximum 1 h after the pulse, clearly preceded the appearance of the other components, and had a very brief half-life (t1/2 = 2.5 h). The Mr = 210,000, Mr = 135,000, and Mr = 95,000 bands were next in appearance and reached a maximum 6 h in the chase period. Monensin, an ionophore which interferes with maturation of some proteins, blocked both the disappearance of the Mr = 190,000 protein and the appearance of the Mr = 135,000 and Mr = 95,000 subunits. The mannose incorporated in the Mr = 190,000 component was fully sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H while that in the Mr = 210,000 band and the two major subunits was only partially sensitive. Tryptic fingerprints of the 125I-labeled Mr = 210,000 band suggested that this component contains peptides of both the Mr = 135,000 and Mr = 95,000 subunits. In conclusion, the Mr = 190,000 component appears to represent the high mannose precursor form of the insulin receptor that undergoes carbohydrate processing and proteolytic cleavage to generate the two major subunits. In addition, the Mr = 210,000 band is probably the fully glycosylated form of the precursor that escapes cleavage and is expressed in the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1556333628,"A model system using RNase A has been established for studying the nonenzymatic glucosylation and glucose-dependent cross-linking of protein (Maillard reaction) under physiological conditions in vitro. The rate of glucosylation of RNase was first order in glucose. Glucosylation was accompanied by a comparable decrease in primary amino groups in the protein and lysine recoverable by amino acid analysis. Analysis of glucosylation reaction mixtures by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of mercaptoethanol revealed the time-dependent formation of RNase dimer and trimer. The polymerization reaction was mixed order with respect to glucose concentration, but was approximately first order with respect to protein concentration. When glucosylated protein was separated from glucose, the protein continued to polymerize even in the absence of glucose. Under these conditions, the primary cross-linking reaction occurred by condensation of a glucosylated amino acid on one RNase molecule with a free amino group on another. Lysine efficiently inhibited cross-linking between glucosylated and native RNase in the absence of glucose. An attempt to model the cross-linking reaction was made by studying the incorporation of [3H]lysine and N alpha-formyl-[3H]lysine into glucosylated RNase. Both were incorporated covalently into glucosylated but not native protein. However, free lysine was the major product recovered following NaBH4 reduction and amino acid analysis of the lysine derivative of glycosylated protein. The data are discussed in terms of the mechanism of protein cross-linking by glucose and the relevance of this reaction to the pathophysiology of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1583096652,"Exogenous unlabeled arachidonic acid (AA) added to human platelets prelabeled with [3H]AA induces breakdown of [3H]phosphatidylinositol and the rapid and transient formation of [3H]1,2-diacylglycerol and [3H]phosphatidic acid (PA), indicating activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Formation of [3H]1,2-diacylglycerol and [3H]PA is inhibited by pretreatment of platelets with aspirin, which suggests that endoperoxides or thromboxane A2 are responsible for AA-induced stimulation of phospholipase C. Exogenous unlabeled AA also induces the formation of [32P]PA or [14C]PA in platelets that have been prelabeled with 32Pi or [14C]AA, respectively. Increased radioactivity in PA reflects increased content of PA as measured by the fatty acid composition of PA. The relation of PA production, which reflects stimulation of phospholipase C, to specific platelet responses was further investigated. Low concentrations of AA (0.05-0.2 microM) induces platelet shape change in parallel to formation of 50-100% PA and phosphorylation of a 40,000 molecular weight protein. Higher concentrations of AA (0.5-50 microM) stimulate the formation of a further amount of PA (200-250%), and phosphorylation of 40,000 molecular weight protein, platelet aggregation, and serotonin release. Indomethacin inhibits all these observed changes by inhibiting the conversion of AA by platelet cyclooxygenase. In contrast, prostacyclin blocks these responses without affecting conversion of AA by platelet cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthetase. We conclude that formation of endoperoxides and thromboxane A2 is necessary but not sufficient for platelet activation by AA. Only if PA is formed are platelets activated. The results indicate a central role for the phospholipase C pathway in the process of platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1494772784,"The actions of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on protein phosphorylation in the GH4C1 clonal strain of rat pituitary cells were examined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and related to the ability of this tripeptide to stimulate prolactin (PRL) synthesis and release, respectively. Between 2 and 10 min after addition of the hormone, TRH increased the rate of phosphorylation of a small number of specific cytoplasmic proteins. The dose-response characteristics for TRH-induced protein phosphorylation were closely similar to those for its biological actions (ED50 congruent to 2 nM). TRH did not stimulate protein phosphorylation in the related GH12C1 cell strain which lacks TRH receptors. The proteins modified by TRH treatment were present in low amounts in the cell; they were not detectable by silver staining of the gels, except for protein 1 (Mr = 80,000) whose TRH-induced conversion from its unphosphorylated to its more acidic phosphorylated form was observed directly on silver-stained gels. Two distinct sets of phosphoproteins were identified among the seven affected by TRH: set I, five proteins whose phosphorylation was increased only by agents which stimulated PRL synthesis; and set II, two proteins whose phosphorylation was also increased by vasoactive intestinal peptide, which stimulates PRL release but not its synthesis in GH4C1 cells. This distinction between phosphoproteins related either to the release or synthesis of PRL was substantiated further by the use of an analog of TRH, A42658, which stimulated PRL synthesis and phosphorylation of proteins of set I at a lower concentration (0.2-0.5 microM) than was required to stimulate PRL release and phosphorylation of proteins of set II (greater than 0.5 microM). Finally, pretreatment of the cells with 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, which prevents TRH-induced PRL release but not synthesis, also suppressed TRH-stimulated phosphorylation of proteins of set II, but not of set I. These results relate stimulation by TRH of the phosphorylation of two distinct sets of proteins to the two major biological action of TRH in GH4C1 cells; proteins of set I appear to be related to the regulation of PRL synthesis, whereas those of set II appear related to modulation of PRL release."
https://openalex.org/W1497295804,"Steady state kinetic parameters were evaluated for the hydrolytic release of fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB) from human fibrinogen by human thrombin at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C, and gamma/2 0.15. At low concentrations of fibrinogen (less than 0.4 microM), the release of FPA from A alpha-chains was first order with respect to both the concentration of fibrinogen A alpha-chains and thrombin. The second order rate constant yielded a value of 11.6 (+/- 0.3) X 10(6) M-1 S-1 for the specificity constant (kcat/Km) for this process. Values of 84 (+/- 4) S-1 and 7.2 (+/- 0.9) microM were evaluated for kcat and Km for the thrombin-catalyzed release of FPA from normal human fibrinogen. The amino acid replacement ArgA alpha 16 leads to His present in fibrinogen Petoskey was shown to result in a 160-fold decrease in the specificity constant for hydrolysis at A alpha 16 and concomitant release of FPA. A kinetic analysis for determination of the sequentiality of release of fibrinopeptides was presented. It indicated that at least 97% of FPB was released after FPA. The specificity constant for release of FPB from intact fibrinogen (if it occurs) was less than 3% of that for release of FPA and less than 10% of that for release of FPB from des-A fibrinogen. The specificity constant for the release of FPB from des-A fibrinogen was 4.2 (+/- 0.2) X 10(6) M-1 S-1. The polymerization inhibitors EDTA and Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro inhibited release of FPB but not FPA. These observations are consistent with the generally accepted view that the predominant pathway for the conversion of normal human fibrinogen to fibrin is one wherein FPA is released, des-A fibrinogen polymerizes, and then FPB is released."
https://openalex.org/W2166622593,"Triolein particles stabilized with egg yolk phosphatidylcholine monolayer were prepared with two different diameters: 26.7 +/- 3.9 and 229 +/- 80 nm. All the phosphatidylcholine molecules in those particles were readily digested by phospholipase A2 while only the molecules in the outer leaflet of phosphatidylcholine unilamellar vesicles were hydrolyzed under the same conditions. Binding of human plasma apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-II, and C-III2 to the particles was studied by two independent techniques: (i) rapid gel permeation chromatography and (ii) ultracentrifugation. All four apolipoproteins bound to the small and large particles in a saturable manner without altering their gross structure, and were displaced by equivalent molecules. The dissociation constant of apolipoprotein A-I for the large particle was 3.17 X 10(-6) M and 4.24 X 10(-6) M by methods (i) and (ii), respectively. These values were more than 10-fold greater than those for the small particles (2.0 X 10(-7) and 1.6 X 10(-7) M, respectively). In contrast, apolipoproteins A-II, C-II, and C-III2 bound to the large particles as strongly as to the small particles with dissociation constants of 2.4-6.8 X 10(-7), 4.5-10.7 X 10(-7), and 5.3-10.7 X 10(-7) M, respectively. The maximum binding level was of a similar order for each of the four apolipoproteins with both lipid particles when they were compared on the basis of amino acids per phospholipid. These results suggest that the apolipoproteins share common binding sites on the lipid particles, and are consistent with the characteristic distribution of apolipoproteins A-I and C among various classes of lipoproteins in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2008150995,Ia (I region-associated) antigens are cell-surface glycoproteins involved in the regulation of immune responsiveness. They are composed of one heavy (alpha) and one light (beta) polypeptide chain. We have sequenced the gene encoding the A beta d chain of the BALB/c mouse. The presence of six exons is predicted by comparison with the complementary DNA sequences of human beta chains and with partial protein sequence data for the A beta d polypeptide. Sequence comparisons have been made to other proteins involved in immune responses and the consequent implications for the evolutionary relationships of these genes are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1489703191,"A protein capable of inhibiting trypsin and other pancreatic proteases has been purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli by conventional procedures and affinity chromatography. It is stable for at least 30 min at 100 degrees C and pH 1.0, but it is inactivated by digestion with pepsin. The inhibitor has an apparent molecular weight of 38,000 as determined by gel filtration and must be a homodimer since it contains a single 18,000-dalton subunit upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The inhibitor has an isoelectric point of 6.1. One dimeric molecule of the inhibitor can bind two trypsin molecules to form a mixed tetrameric complex, in which trypsin molecules are completely inhibited. The inhibitor is not digested by the trypsin. When N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide was used as a trypsin substrate, half-maximal inhibition was observed at 22 nM. This protein also inhibits chymotrypsin, pancreatic elastase, rat mast cell chymase, and human serosal urokinase, but it does not inhibit human pulmonary tryptase, kallikrein, papain, pepsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, subtilisin, and thermolysin. Surprisingly, it did not inhibit any of the eight soluble endoproteases recently isolated from E. coli (i.e. proteases Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ci, and Pi) nor the chymotrypsin-like (protease I) and trypsin-like (protease II) esterases in E. coli. The inhibitor is localized to the periplasmic space and its level did not change with different growth media or stages of cell growth. The physiological function of this E. coli trypsin inhibitor is unknown. We suggest that E. coli trypsin inhibitor be named Ecotin."
https://openalex.org/W1552203490,"Rat liver homogenates in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.5, were heated to 80 degrees C, cooled immediately, and centrifuged at 24,000 X g, and 7Be2+ was added to the supernatant. Twenty-five per cent of the radioactivity was bound to a single protein. It was purified to homogeneity and identified to be ferritin as judged by different criteria. These were sucrose density gradient centrifugation, electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel of the native or sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated protein, reactivity to antibodies, isoelectric focusing, and total amino acid composition. Comparative study of the ability of ferritin or apoferritin to bind Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Be2+ was conducted by using a gel equilibrium technique, Centifree micropartition technique, and microcentrifuge desalting technique. Ferritin could be saturated with Cd2+ or Zn2+ or Cu2+ but not with Be2+ even after 800 g atoms of Be2+ were bound. None of the bound Be2+ was dialyzable at 4 degrees C in 0.05 Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.5, but at pH 6.5 over 80% of the bound metal ion was dialyzed after 72 h. By contrast, apoferritin bound similar amounts of all four metal ions, some of which were dialyzable. By spectrophotometric titrations at pH 6.5 of Be2+ with sulfosalicylic acid (SSA), BeKDSSA was calculated to be 5.0 X 10(-6) M and by competition of sulfosalicyclic acid and ferritin for Be2+ the BeKDferritin was calculated to be 6.8 X 10(-6) M."
https://openalex.org/W1494533689,"Site-specific antibodies to pp60src, the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), have been prepared by immunizing rabbits with a chemically synthesized pentadecapeptide corresponding to residues 498-512 (Cys-Trp-Arg-Lys-Asp-Pro-Glu-Glu-Arg-Pro-Thr-Phe-Lys-Tyr-Leu) as deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the Prague C src gene. Antibodies specific for the synthetic peptide were purified from immune sera by affinity chromatography on peptide-bound Sepharose and characterized by a number of immunocytochemical techniques. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of normal and RSV-transformed cell lines revealed that this peptide antibody identified the authentic viral src gene product. This finding was further supported by indirect immunofluorescence on RSV-transformed rat kidney cells. The anti-peptide antibodies produced dramatic intracellular staining patterns characteristic of the src protein. Although able to immunoprecipitate pp60src, in vitro kinase reactions indicated that, unlike sera from RSV-induced tumor-bearing rabbits, the peptide antibody did not serve as a phosphate acceptor in the immunocomplex. Moreover, immunoprecipitates of pp60src prepared from this site-specific immune reagent were unable to phosphorylate exogenously added casein or the synthetic peptide substrate, Arg-Arg-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly. In contrast, pp60src-containing immunoprecipitates made from an anti-peptide serum specific for the COOH-terminal six amino acids (residues 521-526), a region only eight amino acids removed, readily phosphorylated both substrates. This evidence indicates that an antibody directed against residues 498-512 neutralizes the kinase activity of pp60src and suggests that this region may be functionally necessary for the tyrosine-specific kinase activity of this transforming protein."

All react with hyperimmune anti-M. kansasii serum in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and the more glycosylated members also react by gel diffusion. Both the native glycolipids and their inherent oligosaccharides were purified and the major features of their unique structures determined by acetolysis, partial acid cleavage, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR, and chemical ionization and electron impact mass spectrometry of the permethylated products. They have in common a tetraglucose core, beta-D-Glcp-(1 leads to 3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 leads to 4)- alpha-D-Glcp(1 leads to 1)-alpha-D-Glcp where Glcp is glucopyranose, distinguished by the presence of an alpha,alpha-trehalose substituent. Variable residues of xylose, 3-O-methylrhamnose, fucose, and a novel N-acyl aminosugar, (4,6-dideoxy-2-O-methyl-3-C-methyl-4-(2'-methoxypropionamido)hexose; proof of this structure is not given) are linked to the core and the resulting oligosaccharides are acylated with 2,4-dimethyltetradecanoyl and acetyl functions to present a familial arrangement. Related but species-specific lipooligosaccharides typify Mycobacterium szulgai and apparently a host of other atypical mycobacteria. Thus, the antigenicity, and perhaps other features such as pathogenesis and drug resistance, of most atypical mycobacteria may be rationalized in terms of these new found cell wall lipooligosaccharides and the previously described glycopeptidolipids."

https://openalex.org/W1562254619,"The addition of phenylephrine or vasopressin to isolated hepatocytes resulted in an efflux of calcium. The intracellular source of this calcium was determined by measuring the calcium released upon the sequential additions of an uncoupling agent and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 to control and hormone-treated cells. The release promoted by these agents was used as an estimate of the calcium content of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The validity and limitations of this method are critically evaluated. The source of the calcium mobilized by the hormones was found to depend on the intracellular calcium distribution. When the amount of total cell-releasable Ca2+ was low (less than 0.9 nmol/mg cell dry weight), the endoplasmic reticulum represented the major cellular calcium pool and was also the predominant pool mobilized by the hormone. As the cell calcium content was increased, the endoplasmic reticulum attained its maximum capacity and the mitochondria sequestered increasing amounts of calcium. Under these conditions, the hormones mobilized calcium from the mitochondria with minimal effects on the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pool. These results suggest that more than one hormone-induced Ca2+-releasing agent may be formed. Both the total amount and the rate of calcium released from the cell under the influence of hormones was independent of the cell calcium content. The appearance of hormone-releasable Ca2+ in the extracellular medium showed a lag period of 5 to 10 s, during which a rapid increase of phosphorylase activity was observed. In contrast, the mobilization of a comparable amount of calcium by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone showed no significant lag, but the activation of phosphorylase was slower. A kinetic analysis of the hormone-releasable Ca2+ indicated a rapid onset with a peak increase of cytosolic free Ca2+ between 5 and 10 s prior to release of Ca2+ from the cell. The results suggest that an early action of the hormone is the inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux pump."
https://openalex.org/W2014997607,"We have examined the molecular basis of the response of individuals of D. melanogaster to artificial selection for high and low abdominal bristles. By monitoring the fate of particular rDNA spacer length variants associated with individually isolated X and Y chromosomes, we show that flies from the low bristle number selection lines have undergone an unequal exchange between the X and Y rDNA arrays. Such exchanges result in translocations between X and Y chromosomes, visualised as X.Y compound chromosomes at mitosis. Transfer of few copies of a length variant between X and Y indicates a clustering of variants. Flies that have reverted back to wild-type seemingly have undergone a second unequal exchange, giving rise to a compound X.Y chromosome containing Y rDNA of normal amounts. Unequal exchanges between X and Y rDNA arrays could contribute to the observed coevolution of rDNA sequences on these chromosomes. The biological significance of this outcome is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1508389014,"We have used inhibitors to identify the DNA polymerases which are involved in DNA excision repair induced in confluent diploid human fibroblasts by several DNA damaging agents: UV radiation, N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and bleomycin. We find that DNA repair synthesis involves both DNA polymerase alpha and a non-alpha DNA polymerase, probably polymerase beta. The fraction of repair synthesis mediated by each of the two polymerases is dependent on which DNA-damaging agent is administered and on the dose of damaging agent. Low doses of DNA damage induce DNA repair synthesis which is mediated to a great extent by a non-alpha DNA polymerase, and with an increasing dose of damage there is increasing participation of DNA polymerase alpha in repair synthesis. At high doses of damage, the fraction of repair synthesis mediated by DNA polymerase alpha reaches a maximal level which is dependent on the damaging agent; the maximal level of polymerase alpha involvement is about 80% for UV radiation and N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, about 70% for N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and about 40% for bleomycin."
https://openalex.org/W1568878721,"The Bacillus subtilis gene encoding glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (amidophosphoribosyltransferase) was cloned in pBR322. This gene is designated purF by analogy with the corresponding gene in Escherichia coli. B. subtilis purF was expressed in E. coli from a plasmid promoter. The plasmid-encoded enzyme was functional in vivo and complemented an E. coli purF mutant strain. The nucleotide sequence of a 1651-base pair B. subtilis DNA fragment was determined, thus localizing the 1428-base pair structural gene. A primary translation product of 476 amino acid residues was deduced from the DNA sequence. Comparison with the previously determined NH2-terminal amino acid sequence indicates that 11 residues are proteolytically removed from the NH2 terminus, leaving a protein chain of 465 residues having an NH2-terminal active site cysteine residue. Plasmid-encoded B. subtilis amidophosphoribosyltransferase was purified from E. coli cells and compared to the enzymes from B. subtilis and E. coli. The plasmid-encoded enzyme was similar in properties to amidophosphoribosyltransferase obtained from B. subtilis. Enzyme specific activity, immunological reactivity, in vitro lability to O2, Fe-S content, and NH2-terminal processing were virtually identical with amidophosphoribosyltransferase purified from B. subtilis. Thus E. coli correctly processed the NH2 terminus and assembled [4Fe-4S] centers in B. subtilis amidophosphoribosyltransferase although it does not perform these maturation steps on its own enzyme. Amino acid sequence comparison indicates that the B. subtilis and E. coli enzymes are homologous. Catalytic and regulatory domains were tentatively identified based on comparison with E. coli amidophosphoribosyltransferase and other phosphoribosyltransferase (Argos, P., Hanei, M., Wilson, J., and Kelley, W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6450-6457)."
https://openalex.org/W2086794308,"Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS), a large glycoprotein secreted by the fetal and neonatal testis, is responsible for regression of the Mullerian ducts in the male embryo. This fetal growth regulator has been purified more than 2000-fold from crude testicular incubation medium following fractionation on a triazinyl dye affinity support. A high yield of 60% recovered activity was achieved in the absence of exogenous carrier protein by stabilizing MIS with 2-mercaptoethanol, EDTA, and Nonidet-P40 and eliminating losses in the handling and concentration of MIS fractions. Although affinity elution with nucleotides has proved successful in other systems, MIS could not be eluted with ATP, GTP, or AMP, with or without divalent metal ions. Nucleotide elution, however, does remove contaminating proteins prior to MIS recovery with high ionic strength. The 2000-fold-purified MIS fraction, although not homogeneous, shows a reduction-sensitive band after SDS-gel electrophoresis that has been proposed to be the MIS dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1577238208,"The DNA polymerase induced by bacteriophage T7 can be isolated in two different forms. The distinguishing properties are: 1) the specific activities of the associated 3' to 5' single- and double-stranded DNA exonuclease activities, 2) the ability to catalyze DNA synthesis and strand displacement at nicks, and 3) the degree of stimulation of DNA synthesis on nicked, duplex DNAs by the gene 4 protein of phage T7. Form I is obtained when purification is carried out in the absence of EDTA while Form II is obtained if all purification steps are carried out in the presence of 0.1 mM EDTA. Form I has low levels of both exonuclease activities, less than 5% of those of Form II. Form I can initiate DNA synthesis at nicks leading to strand displacement, a consequence of which is its ability to be stimulated manyfold by the helicase activity of gene 4 protein on nicked, duplex templates. On the other hand, Form II cannot initiate synthesis at nicks even in the presence of gene 4 protein. In keeping with its higher exonuclease activities, Form II of T7 DNA polymerase has higher turnover of nucleotides activity (5-fold higher than Form I) and exhibits greater fidelity of nucleotide incorporation, as indicated by the rate of incorporation of 2-aminopurine deoxynucleoside monophosphate. Both forms of T7 DNA polymerase exhibit higher fidelity of nucleotide incorporation than bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase. In the absence of EDTA or in the presence of FeSO4 or CaCl2, Form II irreversibly converts to Form I. The physical difference between the two forms is not known. No difference in molecular weight can be detected between the corresponding subunits of each form of T7 DNA polymerase as measured by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate."

https://openalex.org/W1599961357,"The effects of insulin and epinephrine on the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase were investigated using rat hemidiaphragms incubated with [32P]phosphate. Antibodies against rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase were used for the rapid purification of the 32P-labeled enzyme under conditions that prevented changes in its state of phosphorylation. The purified material migrated as a single radioactive species (Mapp = 90,000) when subjected to electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Insulin decreased the [32P]phosphate content of glycogen synthase. This effect occurred rapidly (within 15 min) and was observed with physiological concentrations of insulin (25 microunits/ml). The amount of [32P]phosphate removed from glycogen synthase by either different concentrations of insulin or times of incubation with the hormone was well correlated to the extent to which the enzyme was activated. Epinephrine (10 microM) inactivated glycogen synthase and increased its content of [32P]phosphate by about 50%. Cleavage of the immunoprecipitated enzyme with cyanogen bromide yielded two major 32P-labeled fragments of apparent molecular weights equal to approximately 28,000 and 15,000. The larger fragment (Fragment II) displayed electrophoretic heterogeneity similar to that observed with the corresponding CNBr fragment (CB-2) from purified rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase phosphorylated by different protein kinases. Epinephrine increased [32P]phosphate content of both fragments; however, the increase in the radioactivity of the smaller fragment (Fragment I) was more pronounced. Insulin decreased the amount of [32P] phosphate present in Fragments I and II by about 40%. The results presented provide direct evidence that both insulin and epinephrine control glycogen synthase activity by regulating the phosphate present at multiple sites on the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1484425015,"Class II actins, such as Drosophila and mammalian skeletal muscle actins, have genes that code for a Met-X-Asp NH2 terminus where X is usually cysteine. These actins have an Ac-Asp NH2 terminus so two amino acids must be removed. To determine the nature of this processing, we labeled Drosophila Schneider L-2 cells with [35S]methionine or cysteine, isolated the actin, and analyzed the NH2-terminal actin tryptic peptides and their thermolysin digestion products. After a 4-h labeling period, we detected completed actin polypeptide chains with either an unblocked Asp or an Ac-Asp NH2 terminus. No intermediate with an NH2-terminal Cys or Met could be demonstrated. If, however, Drosophila mRNA was translated in a mRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, an additional 43-kDa actin intermediate was observed. On the basis of thermolysin digestion studies and experiments using mild acid hydrolysis of a labeled actin NH2-terminal tryptic peptide fragment, we identified this intermediate as having an Ac-Cys-Asp NH2 terminus. In a time-dependent fashion, Ac-Cys was removed generating actin with an exposed NH2-terminal Asp which was subsequently acetylated to produce the mature form of actin. The removal of Met and the acetylation of Cys may occur early in translation while the nascent polypeptide chain is still attached to the ribosome. Subsequent processing occurs following completion of the synthesis of the actin polypeptide. The removal of Ac-Cys from Drosophila actin is thus similar to removal of Ac-Met from the NH2 terminus of class I actins although in the case of the class II actins, it is the second amino acid that is removed as an acetylated species."

The levels of immunologically active hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid were independent of the number of white blood cells and platelets in the erythrocyte suspensions. Two products were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography; one product was identified as 12-HETE, while a second product appeared to be a dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Radiolabeled arachidonic acid was incorporated into phospholipids. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were primary sources of the 12-HETE and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, all of which were released from the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1512301678,"Abstract Alveolysin has been purified in milligram quantities to apparent immunochemical and electrophoretic homogeneity from the supernatant culture fluid of Bacillus alvei. Purification involved ultrafiltration with concomitant molecular sieving on Amicon hollow fibers, thiol-disulfide interchange chromatography on thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B, and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and Bio-Gel P-100. The purified toxin was found to be a single polypeptide chain of 582 amino acids (Mr = 63,000) free of carbohydrate, with alanine as NH2-terminal amino acid. Nonpolar amino acids accounted for 40% of the total residues. Immunochemical analysis of the precipitation curve of the toxin with anti-alveolysin immune sera indicated the presence of approximately 13 epitopes. The toxin exhibited a specific activity of 10(6) hemolytic units/mg of protein and behaved as an amphiphilic protein as inferred from charge-shift electrophoresis in a three-detergent system, suggesting the presence of substantial hydrophobic region(s). The inhibitory effects of various thiol reagents and that of cholesterol and related 3 beta-hydroxysterols with aliphatic side chains at carbon 17 indicated that alveolysin is a typical member of the group of bacterial--SH-activated toxins. The stoichiometry of cholesterol-toxin interaction was apparently equimolar. The complexes between alveolysin and [3H]cholesterol were characterized by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Cholesterol-containing liposomes were disrupted by the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W159526554,"We have previously reported the enzymatic synthesis of galactosyl-beta 1,3-N-acetylglucosamine using membrane preparations from pig trachea (Sheares, B. T., Lau, J. T. Y., and Carlson, D. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 599-602). The enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of this disaccharide, UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 3 beta-galactosyltransferase, has been solubilized and contaminating galactosyltransferases, including the UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 4 beta-galactosyltransferase and the UDP-galactose:N-acetylgalactosamine-mucin 3 beta-galactosyltransferase, were removed by affinity chromatography on alpha-lactalbumin-agarose, N-acetylglucosamine-agarose, and asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin bound to DEAE-Sephacel. UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 3 beta-galactosyltransferase and a yet unidentified UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 4 beta-galactosyltransferase, both not retained by the alpha-lactalbumin-agarose, were further purified by adsorption to a UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose column and these two galactosyltransferase activities were finally resolved by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. The purified UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 3 beta-galactosyltransferase displays an absolute requirement for a divalent cation (Mn2+ or Co2+) and is most active at pH 6.0. Unlike the UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 4 beta-galactosyltransferase, UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine 3 beta-galactosyltransferase is not inhibited by high concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine. Apparent Km values are UDP-galactose, 0.23 mM, and N-acetylglucosamine, 385 mM. The apparent Km for a synthetic acceptor, N-acetylglucosaminyl-beta 1, 3-N-acetylgalactosamine-O-benzyl, was 2.4 mM. Acceptor specificity suggests that this 3 beta-galactosyltransferase is responsible for elongation of oligosaccharide chains in mucin glycoproteins and in glycolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1485269093,"Reaction of Bacillus subtilis glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine resulted in complete loss of its ability to catalyze glutamine-dependent phosphoribosylamine formation and its glutaminase activity, whereas its ability to catalyze ammonia-dependent phosphoribosylamine formation and to hydrolyze phosphoribosylpyrophosphate was increased. The site of reaction with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine was the NH2-terminal cysteine residue. The NH2-terminal sequence of the B. subtilis enzyme was homologous with that of the corresponding amidotransferase from Escherichia coli, for which the NH2-terminal cysteine is also essential for glutamine utilization (Tso, J. Y., Hermodson, M. A., and Zalkin, H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3532-3536). The fact that the metal-free E. coli amidotransferase contains a glutamine-utilizing structure that is very similar to that found in B. subtilis amidotransferase, which contains an essential [4Fe-4S] center, indicates that the iron-sulfur center probably plays no role in glutamine utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1571954726,"We have studied the kinetics of copper uptake by apoazurin in imidazole and 1-methylimidazole buffers in the pH range of 7-9 with mu = 0.5 M and copper(II) in large excess. The reaction has been monitored by measuring the visible absorbance and circular dichroism as a function of time. The uptake occurs in a stepwise fashion, and at least two intermediates are implicated. Overall, the rate of uptake varies inversely with the concentration of the proton and the (complexing) buffer, but depends directly on the copper concentration. A model involving a weakly absorbing intermediate is proposed to rationalize the data taken at the lower end of the pH range. According to the model the intermediate forms with a second order rate constant of about 30 M-1 S-1 and is probably described as a ternary complex of copper, buffer, and one or more of the histidine ligands of the binding site. This then decays by a pH-dependent process to give product. At higher pH values there is evidence that relaxation to product occurs via a second intermediate form in which the cysteine ligand is bound to copper. The relevance of these results to the question of how copper is selectively incorporated into the protein is considered. Finally, a milder, more reliable route to the preparation of apoazurin is described."
https://openalex.org/W1524715372,"The serum amyloid A proteins (SAA) are transported in plasma in association with the high density lipoproteins. We have studied the solution properties of two of the polymorphic forms of SAA, SAA1 and SAA4, and compared the lipid-binding properties of SAA4 to those of the well characterized apolipoproteins, apo-A-I, apo-A-II, and apo-C-III. SAA4 was monomeric at pH 2.9 but considerable self-association was demonstrated at pH 8.2, even in the presence of 1.0 M guanidine HCl. SAA4 differed from the apolipoproteins in its ability to disrupt multilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes and generate bilayer discs. Apo-A-I, apo-A-II, and apo-C-III reduced the turbidity of DMPC dispersions at protein:lipid molar ratios of 1:200. SAA4, however, increased turbidity at molar ratios of 1:250 and 1:100 even when preincubated in guanidine HCl before addition to liposomes. Optical density decreased only at ratios of 1:50 and 1:25. At an SAA4:DMPC ratio of 1:50, discoidal particles (long axis, 28.1 nm; short axis, 4.4 nm) were formed which were similar to those produced by apo-C-III. Lipid binding induced changes in SAA4 conformation similar to those observed in the apolipoproteins. The alpha-helical content and intrinsic tryptophanyl fluorescence were increased and quenching of tryptophanyl fluorescence by acrylamide was reduced in the presence of DMPC. In addition, SAA4 as well as the apolipoproteins broadened the range and increased the temperature of the gel-liquid crystal transition temperature of DMPC."

https://openalex.org/W1565697221,"In a continued investigation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reaction with micellar, discoidal complexes of phosphatidylcholine (PC) . cholesterol . apolipoprotein A-I (apo-A-I), we prepared well defined complexes with variable free cholesterol contents and examined their reactivity with purified enzyme. The complexes, prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method, were fractionated into and classes by gel filtration of the reaction mixtures through a Bio-Gel A-5m column. The small complexes had egg-PC/cholesterol/apo-A-I molar ratios from 68:14:1 to 80:1:1, discoidal shapes with diameters around 114 (+/- 13) A and widths of 42 A by electron microscopy, and Stokes radii from 47 to 49 A corresponding to molecular weights near 2 X 10(5). The corresponding properties of the large complexes, isolated from samples with higher cholesterol contents, were egg-PC/cholesterol/apo-A-I molar ratios from 84:26:1 to 96:17:1, diameters of 161 (+/- 20) A, widths of 43 A, Stokes radii around 80 A, and estimated molecular weights in the vicinity of 5 X 10(5). Both types of complexes, when adjusted to equal apo-A-I concentrations, gave essentially identical initial reaction velocities with purified lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase over a wide range of cholesterol concentrations (from 2 X 10(-7) to 4 X 10(-4) M), PC/cholesterol molar ratios (from 3:1 to 12:1), and quite different lipid fluidity conditions as detected by diphenylhexatriene fluorescence polarization. When complexes were adjusted to a constant cholesterol concentration, the initial velocities of the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to the apo-A-I concentrations. Arrhenius plots of initial reaction rates for various complexes with variable cholesterol content and fluidity, measured at constant apo-A-I concentrations, gave identical temperature dependences with an average activation energy of 18.0 kcal/mol. These results strongly suggest that the cholesterol esterification on high density lipoprotein particles does not depend on their unesterified-cholesterol contents, PC/unesterified-cholesterol molar ratios, nor on the fluidity of their lipid domains."
https://openalex.org/W1589596137,"The relationship between DNA methylation and the expression of the gamma- and beta-casein genes was investigated in both expressing and nonexpressing tissues and in isolated tumor cell subpopulations displaying differential casein gene expression. MspI/HpaII digestions of DNA isolated from liver, a totally nonexpressing tissue, indicated that specific sites of hypermethylation existed in these genes as compared to the DNA isolated from casein-producing lactating mammary gland. The positions of these sites were mapped in the gamma-casein gene by comparing total genomic DNA Southern blots to the restriction digests of several overlapping phage clones constituting the gamma-casein gene. In contrast, the methylation status of the HhaI sites in the gamma-casein gene was found to be invariant regardless of the expression status of the gene. The inverse correlation between the hypermethylation of certain MspI/HpaII restriction sites in the casein genes and their potential expressibility was further substantiated by studies in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene- and N-nitrosomethylurea-induced mammary carcinomas, which have an attenuated casein gene expression, and in cell subpopulations isolated from the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene tumor which were either depleted or enriched in casein-producing cells. Analysis of total tumor DNAs indicated that the casein genes were hypermethylated at the same sites observed in liver. However, a very faint hybridization signal was observed in the HpaII digests, suggesting cell-specific methylation differences. We have confirmed the hypomethylation of at least two of these MspI/HpaII sites within the subpopulation containing the casein-producing cells at a level consistent with the relative enrichment in that fraction. These results demonstrate differential site-specific casein gene methylation not only between tissues but also between cell subpopulations within a single tissue."

Chem. 257, 4490-4495) that can be, but are not necessarily, intermediates in formation of exocellular enzymes. We have now deleted from the signal region of the Bacillus licheniformis 749/C beta-lactamase gene (penP) 15 base pairs that code for Ala-Leu-Ala-Gly-Cys. This sequence includes the Cys residue that undergoes lipophilic modification and the site of cleavage by signal peptidase and is well conserved in diverse prokaryotic lipoproteins. In the deletion gene, penP delta 1, the remaining Cys is preceded by 8 hydrophobic residues instead of 14 for the original modification site. PenP delta 1 has been cloned in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and its expression and products compared with penP. Penicillinase synthesis by penP delta 1 clones was greater than or equal to amounts formed by penP clones or B. licheniformis. Lipoprotein production from penP delta 1 was very low in either host and appears physiologically insignificant. In E. coli carrying penP delta 1, 25% of the penicillinase was released into the periplasm as a processed form. The remainder was a membrane-associated form of translation product size and was oriented to the periplasm. In mid-log cultures of B. subtilis carrying penP delta 1, the translation product and 2 protease-shortened species were present both in the cytoplasm and on the outer surface of the membrane. Release began at stationary phase and was dependent on the presence of enzyme processing to exo-small and a pH value greater than 7.5. We conclude that the shortened lipophilic sequence of the penP delta 1 prepenicillinase is adequate for transfer of the nascent chain through the membrane."

The fungicide buthiobate (S-n-butyl S'-p-tert-butylbenzyl N-3-pyridyldithiocarbonimidate), which bound specifically to yeast cytochrome P450 responsible for demethylating C-32 of lanosterol and effected a Type II spectral change, did not react with SG1 cytochrome P-450. On the other hand, cholate-solubilized microsomes from SG1 formed a single precipitin line on Ouchterlony plates with antibodies raised against purified (Yoshida, Y., Aoyama, Y., Kumaoka, H., and Kubota, S. (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 78, 1005-1010) yeast cytochrome P-450 specific for demethylating C-32 of lanosterol.

https://openalex.org/W2082933643,We have determined the DNA sequence encoding three sites in Bacillus subtilis phage SP82 early mRNA that are cleaved by a B. subtilis processing endonuclease. The products generated by cleavage of the RNA were sequenced to determine the exact points of RNA strand scission. We propose that the RNA surrounding each processing site forms a stable stem-loop structure and that cleavage occurs at the 5- side of specific adenosine residues located on the loop. The model is consistent with our previous observations that the active site of the enzyme recognizes double-stranded RNA. S1 mapping experiments with RNA-DNA hybrids established that the same cleavage sites are used both in vivo and in vitro. Examination of the B. subtilis processing sites on SP82 mRNA reveals distinctive features of primary and secondary structure that are not present in any of the E. coli RNAase III processing sites previously studied.

In the case of ebgo and ebga, 75 and 85% of the label, respectively, was incorporated into a tryptic peptide which is homologous (38% identity) to residues 483-503 of the lacZ beta-galactosidase sequence. In the ebgo and ebga enzymes, a serine probably is alkylated. In the case of the ebgb enzyme, 61% of the label is found on a tryptic peptide homologous (69% identity) with residues 457-468 of the lacZ beta-galactosidase.

https://openalex.org/W1505976463,"Synthase D and synthase I of high specific activity have been isolated from rabbit liver, with subunit Mr = 78,000 and 85,000, respectively. Minor bands of Mr = 78,000 and 71,000 were also observed, and these were shown to be proteolytic products containing synthase activity. Incubation with trypsin resulted in no activity changes, but there was a conversion of synthase I to the Mr = 78,000 species. Incubation with chymotrypsin produced no change in total synthase activity, but both enzymes were converted to the Mr = 71,000 species. Synthase I, after chymotrypsin treatment, became dependent on glucose-6-P for activity. Kinetic studies indicated that the chymotrypsin-treated synthase D and synthase I were not the same species. Synthase D contained 5.7 mol of alkali-labile phosphate/subunit and synthase I, 2.9 mol/subunit. With trypsin treatment there was little loss of phosphate from synthase. With chymotrypsin treatment, there was a loss of 3.1 and 1.5 mol of phosphate/subunit from synthase D and I, respectively. Some conversion to synthase I still occurred when chymotrypsin-treated synthase D was incubated with crude extract, suggesting that the phosphates which remained were still removable by synthase phosphatase. The presence of additional alkali-stable phosphates was indicated when the synthase samples were ashed. The total phosphates were 17.3 mol/subunit for synthase D and 13.4 mol/subunit for synthase I. Our results indicate that the liver synthase enzymes are highly phosphorylated and extremely susceptible to endogenous and exogenous proteolysis. The alkali-labile phosphates are distributed in chymotrypsin-sensitive as well as chymotrypsin-insensitive sites. Both sites are involved in the conversion of synthase D to synthase I."
https://openalex.org/W1575714747,"The kinetics of Ca2+-release from the two high affinity sites of troponin-C (TnC) was studied by the stopped flow technique following rapid mixing with either EDTA or excess TbCl3. The rate constants obtained by the two methods were 2.8 and 0.7 s-1, respectively. For the tryptic fragment of TnC that contains only the COOH-terminal half of the molecule, both methods generate rate constants of 2.2 s-1. These results are consistent with the interpretation that binding of Tb3+ to the Ca2+-specific sites reduces the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from, and thereby enhances the affinity for, the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites; this, in turn, suggests interactions between the two halves of the TnC molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1598766451,Serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the glycine cleavage system are both present in liver mitochondria and both bind glycine to form a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate carbanionic quinoid species. Lipoic acid has been shown to have the ability to intercept the carbanionic intermediate formed from the binary complex of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and glycine and form an intermediate adduct which is ultimately processed to yield CO2 and a methylamine adduct. Kinetic studies have shown that the lipoic acid-dependent decarboxylation of glycine catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase proceeds through a sequential mechanism. This lipoic acid-dependent decarboxylation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase is similar to the initial reaction of the glycine cleavage system and to the lipoic acid-dependent decarboxylation of glycine by the P-protein alone suggesting that both enzymes could serve in lieu of each other.
https://openalex.org/W1866918790,"In diauxic growth, the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate: glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) regulates the utilization of certain compounds which are not PTS substrates. It has recently been shown that this PTS regulation is mediated via one of the PTS phosphocarrier proteins, IIIGlc. In the present studies, IIIGlc was derivatized with the fluorescent reagent fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate. One mol of label was incorporated per mol of protein and the label was located at the NH2-terminal amine, as shown by tryptic peptide mapping and one-step Edman-type degradation. The fluorescent moiety was found to be stable and resistant to photodecomposition. The fluorescent IIIGlc was purified and shown to be fully active in its ability to accept phosphate from phospho-HPr (the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system), but only 20% active in catalyzing the transfer of the phosphate to methyl alpha-glucoside via the membrane-bound II-BGlc protein. The decay of the fluorescence intensity was dominated by a single component (90%) with a lifetime of 4 ns. The decay of the fluorescence emission anisotropy was determined for excitation in both a negative and positive transition of fluorescein and was best described in terms of a biexponential function, indicating internal motion of the fluorophore and possible anisotropic rotation of the protein as a whole. The formation of a complex between IIIGlc and HPr was demonstrated by using the techniques of time-resolved and steady state fluorescence emission measurements, resonance energy transfer, and equilibrium gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W2414631638,"A variant that uniformly reduces the activity of larval and adult isozymes of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) throughout development has been isolated and analyzed. This low activity line (BI 114), which bears the fast electrophoretic structural allele, has been analyzed in comparison with two high activity control lines, WGM 74 (fast electrophoretic variant) and RI09 (slow electrophoretic variant). The enzyme has been purified from each line and all three variants have similar kinetic, immunological, and physicochemical parameters, except for pI differences associated with the electrophoretic differences observed. Enzyme-specific cross-reacting material analysis corroborates the activity data indicating differential rates of enzyme accumulation between lines throughout development. Protein turnover studies indicate that the rate of intracellular degradation between lines is the same, and that the activity and enzyme-specific cross-reacting material differences observed are due to differential rates of synthesis of the enzyme. Genetic analysis indicates that the variation in the rate of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase synthesis segregates as a single gene with additive inheritance and is closely linked to the structural gene. Zymogram analysis of F1 heterozygotes has indicated that the variant acts as a cis-regulator and affects both isozymes equally throughout development. We have therefore designated this variant as a systemic regulator controlling the rate of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1520130854,"The mechanism by which polyenoic acids control the amount and positioning of monounsaturated fatty acids in choline phosphoglycerides from baby hamster kidney cells was studied. Under normal growth conditions monoenoic acids were derived from the desaturation of saturated fatty acids and comprised over 50% of the fatty acids at position 1 of the glycerol moiety. The monoene content of positions 1 and 2 decreased in response to the addition of di- and polyenoic acids to the culture medium. All the di- and polyenoic acid supplements tested inhibited the desaturation of palmitic and stearic acid and replaced monoenes at position 2. However only linoleic, linolenic, and eicosadienoic acids replaced monoenes at position 1. The results suggest that under appropriate conditions up to 25% of the choline phosphoglyceride fraction consisted of a stable molecular species containing di- or trienoic fatty acids at both the 1 and 2 positions of glycerol moiety. With eicosatrienoic or arachidonic acid supplements, on the other hand, the monoenes at position 1 were replaced with saturated fatty acids. The magnitude of these effects, particularly at position 1, was proportional to the concentration of the fatty acid supplement. The results suggest that polyenes with at least 20 carbon atoms can play a key role in determining the ultimate composition and positioning of fatty acids in baby hamster kidney choline phosphoglycerides and that this control is mediated by their ability to inhibit delta 9 desaturase and by a retailoring system specific for these polyenes."
https://openalex.org/W1537640005,"Lines of KB cells resistant to Sendai virus-induced cytolysis have been isolated and characterized (Toyama, S., Toyama, Su., and Uetake, H. (1977) Virology 76, 503-515). This study is concerned with the nature of this mutation. Plasma membrane fractions from Sil cells were found to have decreased amount of sialic acid and the same amount of galactose as compared to the membranes from parental KB cells. Sil cells exhibited an increase in sensitivity to toxic effects of ricin and a decrease in sensitivity to wheat germ agglutinin. Binding of wheat germ agglutinin to Sil cells was markedly decreased. Several membrane glycoproteins of Sil cells migrated slightly faster than the corresponding bands of wild type membrane when examined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Sil cells had decreased sialyltransferase activity that catalyzed the transfer of sialic acid residues from CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid to glycoprotein acceptors containing Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc alpha 1 leads to O-Ser(Thr) chain. The decreased enzyme activity could not be accounted for by the presence of inhibitors, altered pH optimum, or increased sialidase or CMP-sialic acid hydrolase activities. These results indicate that a molecular basis for the Sil cell phenotype might be the deficiency of sialyltransferase."
