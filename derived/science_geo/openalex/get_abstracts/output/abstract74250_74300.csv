https://openalex.org/W2039175897,"MELATONIN (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) has been shown to be the most effective skin-lightening agent in amphibians1,2. This compound produces changes in pigmentation by causing the aggregation of melanin granules within the amphibian melanocyte. Although melatonin has been found to occur in mammals, no evidence for its formation has been obtained in amphibians where it exerts its most potent effects. High concentrations of radioactivity have been observed in the pineal area of the amphibian Xenopus laevis after the administration of the melatonin precursors 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine and 14C-methylmethionine3."

Domestic sewage, collected in the main drainage of the city of Hamburg, has been continually tested for Salmonella during the past twenty years. Salmonella occurs at a density equivalent to 5,000 organisms in 1,000 ml. of sewage."

Among those who prepared interferon of high specific activity, Lampson et al.1 achieved a purification factor of 1830 after treatment with perchloric acid, concentration with zinc acetate and two fractionations on ‘CM-cellulose’. Such material still contained an inactive protein component that was only removed by electrophoresis on ‘Pevikon’. The final material had been purified 4,500 times. Fantes et al.2 purified interferon several thousand times by adsorption on ‘Doucil’, elution with KSCN, precipitation of impurities in the presence of KSCN at pH 3.5, precipitation of interferon with methanol at pH. 7.5 and chromatography on DEAE cellulose at pH. 7.5. Merigan3 purified crude interferon with perchloric acid and zinc acetate by the method of Lampson et al.1, achieving a 15-fold purification. Such material, after one chromatographic fractionation on ‘CM-Sephadex’, using a pH gradient instead of Lampson's stepwise process for eluting the active ingredient, was claimed to be purer than Lampson's material, though no evidence of electrophoretie homogeneity was presented."

https://openalex.org/W1971357782,"THIS communication describes a new and accurate method of treating malignant disease by radiation. The radiotherapeutic world is convinced that accuracy in dose delivery in adequate amounts to minimum volumes has largely been responsible for improved results in limited disease. Just as surgery has its complications and rare fatal accidents, so also does a proportion of radiation injuries have to be accepted at curative dose-levels. A high standard of accuracy in treatment does much to reduce injuries by limiting the volume of tissue exposed. This new method has been the logical sequence of development over the past twenty-five years, passing through four phases."

https://openalex.org/W2001570469,"Feldberg and Fessard1 have shown that the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata is activated by acetylcholine (ACh) and that it contains a substance like ACh, as determined by bioassay, equivalent to between 40 and 100 µg ACh/g tissue. It has been suggested recently2,3 that not all the material extracted from nervous tissue and bioassayed as ACh is in fact ACh. Since, so far as we are aware, the ACh-like activity extracted from Torpedo is the highest reported for any vertebrate tissue, confirmation of the nature of the active substance and a study of its metabolism in the electric organ are of interest. As a necessary preliminary we have reinvestigated the content of ACh by three different extraction procedures."

https://openalex.org/W2018939510,"IN recent years it has repeatedly been proved that neonatal or very young animals are very susceptible to carcinogenesis induced by different agents. One possible explanation is that tissues of new-born animals contain a large number of incompletely differentiated cells, particularly responsive to carcinogenic stimuli. It is relevant to this speculation that a close correlation has been noted between susceptibility of mice to develop malignant lymphomas and the presence in the thymus of a great concentration of immature cells, whether by reason of early age1, genetic constitution2, whole-body X-irradiation3, or regenerative changes in implanted thymus4. In thymectomized, virus-inoculated5 or X-irradiated4 mice, implantation of new-born thymus proved much more effective than adult thymus in restoring leukaemogenesis."

These antibodies react with homogenates or extracts of brain and also with purified encephalitogenic agents of the basic protein type; in this study only the anti-basic protein response has been evaluated."
