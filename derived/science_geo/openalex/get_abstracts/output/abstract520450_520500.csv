https://openalex.org/W2032166347,"In this study, involving melanoma patients and a mouse model for melanoma, an optimal anti-tumour response was induced by using a combination of radiation with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies, each attacking the tumour from a different angle. This study, involving melanoma patients and a mouse model for melanoma, demonstrates that an optimal anti-tumour response involves a combination of the three tested treatment modalities: high-dose radiation, together with two different types of immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA4 and anti PD-L1), each attacking the tumour from a different angle. Immune checkpoint inhibitors1 result in impressive clinical responses2,3,4,5, but optimal results will require combination with each other6 and other therapies. This raises fundamental questions about mechanisms of non-redundancy and resistance. Here we report major tumour regressions in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with an anti-CTLA4 antibody (anti-CTLA4) and radiation, and reproduced this effect in mouse models. Although combined treatment improved responses in irradiated and unirradiated tumours, resistance was common. Unbiased analyses of mice revealed that resistance was due to upregulation of PD-L1 on melanoma cells and associated with T-cell exhaustion. Accordingly, optimal response in melanoma and other cancer types requires radiation, anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1/PD-1. Anti-CTLA4 predominantly inhibits T-regulatory cells (Treg cells), thereby increasing the CD8 T-cell to Treg (CD8/Treg) ratio. Radiation enhances the diversity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of intratumoral T cells. Together, anti-CTLA4 promotes expansion of T cells, while radiation shapes the TCR repertoire of the expanded peripheral clones. Addition of PD-L1 blockade reverses T-cell exhaustion to mitigate depression in the CD8/Treg ratio and further encourages oligoclonal T-cell expansion. Similarly to results from mice, patients on our clinical trial with melanoma showing high PD-L1 did not respond to radiation plus anti-CTLA4, demonstrated persistent T-cell exhaustion, and rapidly progressed. Thus, PD-L1 on melanoma cells allows tumours to escape anti-CTLA4-based therapy, and the combination of radiation, anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1 promotes response and immunity through distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2077955816,"Stephen Rich and colleagues report the discovery and fine mapping of type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci using the Immunochip. They also perform comparative analyses with 15 other immune disorders and find evidence of colocalization of causal variants with lymphoid gene enhancers. Genetic studies of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have identified 50 susceptibility regions1,2, finding major pathways contributing to risk3, with some loci shared across immune disorders4,5,6. To make genetic comparisons across autoimmune disorders as informative as possible, a dense genotyping array, the Immunochip, was developed, from which we identified four new T1D-associated regions (P < 5 × 10−8). A comparative analysis with 15 immune diseases showed that T1D is more similar genetically to other autoantibody-positive diseases, significantly most similar to juvenile idiopathic arthritis and significantly least similar to ulcerative colitis, and provided support for three additional new T1D risk loci. Using a Bayesian approach, we defined credible sets for the T1D-associated SNPs. The associated SNPs localized to enhancer sequences active in thymus, T and B cells, and CD34+ stem cells. Enhancer-promoter interactions can now be analyzed in these cell types to identify which particular genes and regulatory sequences are causal."
https://openalex.org/W2002715948,"Doug Easton and colleagues report the results of a large-scale genome-wide association study of breast cancer. They discover 15 new susceptibility loci and highlight likely target genes in several of the newly associated regions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large-scale replication studies have identified common variants in 79 loci associated with breast cancer, explaining ∼14% of the familial risk of the disease. To identify new susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 GWAS, comprising 15,748 breast cancer cases and 18,084 controls together with 46,785 cases and 42,892 controls from 41 studies genotyped on a 211,155-marker custom array (iCOGS). Analyses were restricted to women of European ancestry. We generated genotypes for more than 11 million SNPs by imputation using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, and we identified 15 new loci associated with breast cancer at P < 5 × 10−8. Combining association analysis with ChIP-seq chromatin binding data in mammary cell lines and ChIA-PET chromatin interaction data from ENCODE, we identified likely target genes in two regions: SETBP1 at 18q12.3 and RNF115 and PDZK1 at 1q21.1. One association appears to be driven by an amino acid substitution encoded in EXO1."
https://openalex.org/W2017526840,"Achieving site selectivity in C-H functionalization reactions is a significant challenge, especially when the target C-H bond is distant from existing functional groups. Coordination of a functional group to a metal is often a key driving force and control element in many important reactions including asymmetric hydrogenation, epoxidation and lithiation. Exploitation of this effect has led to the development of a broad range of directed C-H activation reactions. However, these C-H activation methods are limited to proximal C-H bonds, which are spatially and geometrically accessible from the directing functional group. The development of meta-selective C-H functionalizations remains a significant challenge. We recently developed a U-shaped template that can be used to overcome this constraint and have shown that it can be used to selectively activate remote meta-C-H bonds. Although this approach has proved to be applicable to various substrates and catalytic transformations, the need for a covalently attached, complex template is a substantial drawback for synthetic applications. Here we report an alternative approach employing norbornene as a transient mediator to achieve meta-selective C-H activation with a simple and common ortho-directing group. The use of a newly developed pyridine-based ligand is crucial for relaying the palladium catalyst to the meta position by norbornene after initial ortho-C-H activation. This catalytic reaction demonstrates the feasibility of switching ortho-selectivity to meta-selectivity in C-H activation of the same substrate by catalyst control."

Survival rates varied dramatically among subtypes, with alpha-RGCs (αRGCs) surviving preferentially.

Our results reveal dramatic subtype-specific differences in the ability of RGCs to survive and regenerate following injury, and they identify promising agents for promoting axonal regeneration. Regeneration following injury to the mammalian brain or spinal cord is notoriously poor: few survivors extend axons beyond the injury site (Ramon y Cajal, 1928Ramon y Cajal S. Degeneration and Regeneration of the Nervous System. Oxford University Press, New York1928Google Scholar), and in some cases, many of the axotomized neurons die (Mansour-Robaey et al., 1994Mansour-Robaey S. Clarke D.B. Wang Y.C. Bray G.M. Aguayo A.J.

Limited regeneration can be explained in at least two different ways. First, non-genetic differences among neurons could account for differences in outcome—for example, stochastic variation, history of activity, or proximity to environmental cues that modulate growth. Alternatively or in addition, distinct subpopulations within a seemingly homogeneous population could regenerate preferentially, owing to preexisting qualities that improve their lot. Distinguishing among these and other alternatives is important both in guiding searches for protective factors and in assessing interventions designed to enhance regeneration. Here, we analyzed retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to address this issue. All visual information is conveyed from the eye to the brain by RGC axons, which run though the optic nerve to retinorecipient areas such as the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus. Although all RGCs share numerous attributes, they can be divided into ∼30 distinct subpopulations, on the basis of morphological, physiological, and molecular criteria (Masland, 2012Masland R.H.

After damage to the mouse optic nerve, >80% of RGCs die, and <1% of the survivors extend axons past the site of damage (Mansour-Robaey et al., 1994Mansour-Robaey S. Clarke D.B. Wang Y.C. Bray G.M.

Regeneration of a substantial number of RGC axons can be elicited, however, by manipulations of the neurons themselves or the environment through which they grow (Aguayo et al., 1991Aguayo A.J.

Thus, one can ask whether specific subsets of RGCs differ in their abilities to survive following nerve crush and/or regenerate axons following treatment. In the first part of this study, we assessed the survival of 11 RGC subtypes after transection of the optic nerve in mice. Subtypes differed dramatically in susceptibility to damage, with the largest RGC types, alpha-RGCs (αRGCs), surviving preferentially but not exclusively. We then promoted regeneration by suppressing expression of PTEN, which acts, at least in part, by enhancing mTOR activity (Jaworski et al., 2005Jaworski J. Spangler S. Seeburg D.P. Hoogenraad C.C.

On the basis of these results, we sought features of αRGCs that might account for their regenerative ability and found three: they have high endogenous levels of mTOR activity, they selectively express a secreted phosphoprotein, osteopontin (OPN) (Bellahcène et al., 2008Bellahcène A.

Kundu G.C. Osteopontin selectively regulates p70S6K/mTOR phosphorylation leading to NF-kappaB dependent AP-1-mediated ICAM-1 expression in breast cancer cells.Mol. Cancer. 2010; 9: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and they selectively express receptors for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which promotes the regeneration of some neuronal types (Dupraz et al., 2013Dupraz S. Grassi D. Karnas D. Nieto Guil A.F. Hicks D. Quiroga S. The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is essential for axonal regeneration in adult central nervous system neurons.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e54462Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of OPN in combination with IGF-1 promotes regeneration of αRGCs as effectively as PTEN suppression. Together, our work identifies a neuronal-intrinsic factor that can promote regeneration and provides a strategy to identify additional regeneration-promoting factors. We used immunohistochemical and transgenic approaches to mark molecularly distinct subsets of RGCs in mice: (1) There are four groups of ON-OFF direction-selective RGCs (ooDSGCs), each tuned to motion in a single direction: ventral, dorsal, nasal, and temporal. Antibodies to the neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) label all four groups (Kay et al., 2011Kay J.N. De la Huerta I. Kim I.J. Zhang Y. Yamagata M. Chu M.W. Meister M. Sanes J.R. Retinal ganglion cells with distinct directional preferences differ in molecular identity, structure, and central projections.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7753-7762Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), while a transgenic line, HB9-GFP, labels the subset tuned to ventral motion (Trenholm et al., 2011Trenholm S. Johnson K. Li X. Smith R.G. Awatramani G.B. Parallel mechanisms encode direction in the retina.Neuron. 2011; 71: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). (2) W3-RGCs are labeled with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in the TYW3 mouse line (Kim et al., 2010Kim I.J. Zhang Y. Meister M. Sanes J.R. Laminar restriction of retinal ganglion cell dendrites and axons: subtype-specific developmental patterns revealed with transgenic markers.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). W3-RGCs are among the smallest RGCs in terms of soma size and dendritic diameter and are among the most numerous RGCs. They comprise at least two populations: W3B, which are motion sensitive but not direction selective, and W3D, which remain physiologically uncharacterized (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang Y. Kim I.J. Sanes J.R. Meister M. The most numerous ganglion cell type of the mouse retina is a selective feature detector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2012; 109: E2391-E2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). (3) Antibodies to melanopsin label M1- and M2-RGCs, two subsets of intrinsically photosensitive RGCs that can be distinguished by the sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer within which their dendrites arborize (Berson et al., 2010Berson D.M.

(4) The RGCs with the largest somata are αRGCs. In mice, they comprise at least three subtypes, which differ in physiological properties as well as dendritic stratification (Estevez et al., 2012Estevez M.E. Fogerson P.M. Ilardi M.C. Borghuis B.G.

We recently generated and characterized a mouse line in which Cre recombinase is inserted into the locus encoding a potassium channel modifier, kcng4. When crossed to a reporter line (Buffelli et al., 2003Buffelli M. Burgess R.W. Feng G. Lobe C.G. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Genetic evidence that relative synaptic efficacy biases the outcome of synaptic competition.Nature. 2003; 424: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), subsets of bipolar cells and RGCs were YFP positive in double-transgenic offspring (Kcng4-cre;Thy1-stop-YFP line 1; called Kcng4-YFP here) (Duan et al., 2014Duan X.

Type II cadherins guide assembly of a direction-selective retinal circuit.Cell. 2014; 158: 793-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that the labeled RGCs had large somata and dendrites and were rich in a neurofilament-associated epitope, SMI32 (Figure S1). These features identified them as αRGCs (Berson, 2008Berson D.M. Retinal ganglion-cell types and their central projections.in: Basbaum A.I. Kaneko A. Shepard G.M. Westheimer G. The Senses: A Comprehensive Reference. Academic Press, San Diego2008: 491-520Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Peichl, 1991Peichl L. Alpha ganglion cells in mammalian retinae: common properties, species differences, and some comments on other ganglion cells.Vis. Neurosci. 1991; 7: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Morphological and physiological analysis revealed that labeled RGCs included all three types of αRGCs, and no other RGCs (Figure 1B; M.Q., X.D., J.R.S., B. Krieger, and M. Meister, unpublished data). Thus, the Kcng4-cre line provides selective genetic access to αRGCs. Together, these markers allowed us to assay the survival of 11 RGC subtypes (4 ooDSGCs, 2 W3-RGCs, 3 αRGCs, and 2 melanopsin-positive RGCs). We crushed the optic nerves of wild-type or transgenic mice and then assessed RGC survival 14 days post crush (dpc). Consistent with previous reports (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), ∼20% of RGCs survived, as assessed by staining for class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1), a pan-RGC marker (Figures 1A and 1C). The survival rate varied greatly among RGC subtypes. More than 80% of the αRGCs (Kcng4-YFP RGCs) and more than 70% of the M1-RGCs survived, whereas few if any M2-RGCs or ooDSGCs (HB9-GFP and CART+ RGCs) survived (Figures 1A–1C). Survival of W3-RGCs was intermediate (∼10%). Examination of Kcng4-YFP retinal cross-sections, in which the three αRGC subtypes can be distinguished by dendritic lamination, indicated that all three subtypes survived (Figure 1B). As a consequence, αRGCs and M1-RGCs, which comprise ∼6% and ∼3% of all RGCs in the normal retina, respectively, accounted for 23% and 11% of surviving RGCs by 14 dpc (Figure 1E). To assess whether the apparently preferential survival of αRGCs represented a delayed cell loss, we examined animals after 2 additional weeks (28 dpc). Although ∼10% of the RGCs were lost between 14 and 28 dpc, αRGCs and M1-RGCs were still preferentially spared and constituted ∼25% and ∼15% of all surviving RGCs, respectively (Figures 1D and 1E). Thus, αRGCs and M1-RGCs survive preferentially but not exclusively following nerve crush. Next, we compared the ability of RGC subtypes to extend axons following injury. To promote regeneration, we injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding a previously validated short hairpin RNA directed against PTEN (shPTEN) (Zukor et al., 2013Zukor K. Belin S. Wang C. Keelan N. Wang X. He Z. Short hairpin RNA against PTEN enhances regenerative growth of corticospinal tract axons after spinal cord injury.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 15350-15361Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), a negative regulator of mTOR signaling. We used immunostaining for a phosphorylated form (Ser235/236) of ribosome protein S6 (pS6) to assay the efficacy of shPTEN, on the basis of previous studies showing that pS6 provides a reliable estimate of mTOR activity (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Levels of pS6 were increased in ∼60% of RGCs in optimally infected areas by 2 weeks after infection with AAV-shPTEN (Figure 2A). Thus, AAV infects, and PTEN restricts mTOR signaling in, most if not all RGC subtypes. A control AAV (AAV-GFP) infected a similar fraction of RGCs but had no effects on pS6. AAV-shPTEN had no detectable effect on retinal structure or integrity (data not shown). To assess regeneration, we crushed the optic nerve in Kcng4-YFP, HB9-GFP, and TYW3 mice 2 weeks after AAV-shPTEN administration, then analyzed retina and optic nerve 14 dpc. Selective survival of αRGCs following depletion of PTEN was similar to that observed in control retinas after crush (Figure S2A compared with Figure 1A). Regeneration was detected by counting YFP- or GFP-positive axons in longitudinal sections through the optic nerves. We observed substantial regeneration of αRGC axons but no detectable regeneration of ooDSGC or W3-RGC axons (Figure 2B). To visualize all regenerating axons, we injected the anterograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into the retina 2 to 3 days before sacrifice. In all lines, approximately 150 axons per retina regenerated at least 0.5 mm past the crush site, accounting for ∼2.5% of surviving RGCs (Figures 2C and 2D). Importantly, >90% of the CTB-positive axons in the Kcng4-YFP retina were also YFP positive (Figure 2D). No markers were available to label M1-RGC axons, but the near complete overlap of CTB- and YFP-positive axons in the Kcng4-YFP line suggests that few if any M1-RGCs or other RGC subtypes regenerate. Thus, αRGC account for the vast majority of the regenerating axons after downregulation of PTEN. In the adult retina, ∼10% of RGCs are stained intensely with anti-pS6 and therefore have high mTOR activity (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). We asked whether the pS6-rich cells are αRGCs. In initial studies, we found variable pS6 levels in RGCs of adult mice (data not shown). We reasoned that neuronal activity, which is known to stimulate phosphorylation of pS6 (Knight et al., 2012Knight Z.A. Tan K. Birsoy K. Schmidt S. Garrison J.L. Wysocki R.W. Emiliano A. Ekstrand M.I. Friedman J.M. Molecular profiling of activated neurons by phosphorylated ribosome capture.Cell. 2012; 151: 1126-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), contributed to this variability. We therefore dark-adapted mice overnight to decrease activity of RGCs, then stained retinas of Kcng4-YFP mice for pS6. In dark-adapted retinas, ∼6% of RGCs were clearly pS6 rich, and the others were not detectably pS6 positive (Figure 3A). The pS6-rich RGCs were αRGCs: >90% of Kcng4-YFP+ RGCs neurons were rich in pS6, and >85% of pS6-rich neurons were YFP+ (Figure 3B). In contrast, few if any M1-RGCs were pS6 rich (data not shown). mTOR acts through two signaling complexes called mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of S6 is downstream of mTORC1, indicating that mTORC1 activity is enhanced in αRGCs. To test this idea, we stained retinas with antibodies specific to phosphorylated-Raptor (pRaptor) and phosphorylated-Rictor (pRictor), which are mTORC1- and mTORC2-specific signaling components, respectively. pRaptor was concentrated in αRGCs, whereas pRictor was present at low levels in non-αRGCs and barely detectable in αRGCs (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, mTORC1 is active in αRGCs. We then asked whether αRGCs express other genes that could play roles in their selective survival and regeneration. In initial studies, we detected expression of OPN (gene symbol Spp1, for secreted phosphoprotein-1) in large RGCs in adult retina (M. Yamagata and J.R.S, unpublished data). We selected this candidate for further analysis because OPN is expressed by a subset of RGCs in rats (Ju et al., 2000Ju W.K. Kim K.Y. Cha J.H. Kim I.B. Lee M.Y. Oh S.J. Chung J.W. Chun M.H. Ganglion cells of the rat retina show osteopontin-like immunoreactivity.Brain Res. 2000; 852: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), can enhance mTOR activity (Ahmed and Kundu, 2010Ahmed M. Kundu G.C. Osteopontin selectively regulates p70S6K/mTOR phosphorylation leading to NF-kappaB dependent AP-1-mediated ICAM-1 expression in breast cancer cells.Mol. Cancer. 2010; 9: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and has been implicated in injury responses of other neuronal types (see Discussion). Immunostaining in the Kcng4-YFP line revealed that >90% of αRGCs were OPN+, and 84% of OPN+ RGCs were αRGCs (Figures 3E and 3F). Likewise, OPN and neurofilament SMI32 staining overlapped by >90% (Figure S1B). To assess whether OPN regulates mTOR activity in the retina, we used AAV-mediated gene transfer to express OPN in multiple RGC subtypes. More than 60% of RGCs were strongly OPN+ in optimally infected areas 2 weeks after infection, and levels of pS6 were high in ∼60% of OPN-rich RGCs (Figures 3G and 3H). Because αRGCs constitute only 6% of RCGs, OPN is clearly able to stimulate mTOR signaling in non-αRGCs We also used OPN null mutant mice (OPN−/−) to ask whether the high mTOR levels of αRGCs require expression of OPN. Levels of pS6 in αRGCs did not differ detectably between controls and OPN−/− mice (Figures 3I and 3J). Thus, OPN stimulates mTOR activity but is presumably not the only factor that maintains high levels of mTOR activity in αRGCs. Before assessing the ability of OPN to affect regeneration, we investigated its role in the normal development of αRGCs. We found that the difference in size between αRGC and non-αRGC somata arose during the first postnatal week, whereas OPN was not detectable in RGCs until the second postnatal week (Figures 4A and 4B ). These results suggested that OPN is dispensable for the initial growth of RGCs. Consistent with this idea, we found no significant difference in size between control and OPN−/− αRGCs during the period of peak growth or in adulthood (Figure S3A and data not shown). Moreover, the majority of RGCs were rich in pS6 during the first postnatal week, and pS6 immunoreactivity did not become restricted to αRGCs until the third postnatal week (Park et al., 2008Park K.K. Liu K. Hu Y. Smith P.D. Wang C. Cai B. Xu B. Connolly L. Kramvis I. Sahin M. He Z. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.Science. 2008; 322: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Thus, neither selective mTOR signaling nor selective expression of OPN is required for αRGCs to reach their normal size. We also asked whether OPN can promote growth of RGCs in adults using AAV-mediated gene transfer of OPN, as described above. RGC soma size (measured by area in sections) increased by ∼30% over controls 4 weeks after the introduction of OPN to a broad range of RGC types using Thy1-cre mice (Figures 4C and 4D). Analysis with subtype-specific markers indicated that small W3-RGCs were affected disproportionately (80% increase in area), whereas the size of αRGCs did not increase in the presence of supernormal levels of OPN (Figures 4E and S3B); this is consistent with the presence of additional growth-promoting factors in these neurons. Together, these results indicate that OPN does not play an essential role in the development of αRGCs but can elicit RGC growth and mTOR signaling in adult retina. To determine whether OPN could promote axonal regeneration following nerve injury, we used the optic nerve crush protocol described above but infected retinal cells with AAV expressing OPN instead of shPTEN. Immunostaining showed expression of OPN in ∼80% of RGCs in injured retina (data not shown), but regeneration was not significantly more effective in its presence than in control retinas (Figures 5A and 5B ). We therefore combined AAV-OPN administration with intravitreal injection of a growth factor. We chose IGF-1 because it has neuroprotective and regeneration-promoting abilities in other contexts (Dupraz et al., 2013Dupraz S. Grassi D. Karnas D. Nieto Guil A.F. Hicks D. Quiroga S. The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor is essential for axonal regeneration in adult central nervous system neurons.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e54462Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Hollis et al., 2009Hollis 2nd, E.R.

Neurol. 2009; 215: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and because its receptor, IGF1R, is expressed by RGCs (Bu et al., 2013Bu S.Y. Yu G.H. Xu G.X.

Axonal regeneration induced by repetitive electrical stimulation of crushed optic nerve in adult rats.Jpn. J. Ophthalmol. 2009; 53: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; and see below). IGF-1 alone had no detectable effect on regeneration, but the combination promoted regeneration as effectively as shPTEN (Figures 5A and 5B). In some cases, axons regenerated and extended more than 2 mm (Figure S4A). OPN and IGF-1 promoted RGC survival to a modest extent (Figures S5A and S5B), but the effect on survival was insufficient to account for the effect on axonal regeneration. We then tested the relationship of OPN, IGF-1, and mTOR activation as promoters of regeneration. IGF-1 on its own had no detectable effect of mTOR signaling in RGCs following axotomy, but expression of OPN, with or without IGF-1 enhanced mTOR signaling, after axotomy, as it did in normal retinas (Figures S6A and S6B). Moreover, rapamycin, a potent and specific inhibitor of mTOR (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR sign"

Types 1 and 2 diabetes affect some 380 million people worldwide. Both ultimately result from a deficiency of functional pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells. Beta cells proliferate in humans during a brief temporal window beginning around the time of birth, with a peak percentage (∼2%) engaged in the cell cycle in the first year of life1,2,3,4. In embryonic life and after early childhood, beta cell replication is barely detectable. Whereas beta cell expansion seems an obvious therapeutic approach to beta cell deficiency, adult human beta cells have proven recalcitrant to such efforts1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Hence, there remains an urgent need for antidiabetic therapeutic agents that can induce regeneration and expansion of adult human beta cells in vivo or ex vivo. Here, using a high-throughput small-molecule screen (HTS), we find that analogs of the small molecule harmine function as a new class of human beta cell mitogenic compounds. We also define dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase-1a (DYRK1A) as the likely target of harmine and the nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors as likely mediators of human beta cell proliferation and differentiation. Using three different mouse and human islet in vivo–based models, we show that harmine is able to induce beta cell proliferation, increase islet mass and improve glycemic control. These observations suggest that harmine analogs may have unique therapeutic promise for human diabetes therapy. Enhancing the potency and beta cell specificity of these compounds are important future challenges."

Only a small region in the contralateral dorsal posterior insula tracked the full pain experience, suggesting it is the homolog of a nociception-specific region found in animals. Several brain regions have been implicated in human painful experiences, but none have been proven to be specific to pain. We exploited arterial spin-labeling quantitative perfusion imaging and a newly developed procedure to identify a specific role for the dorsal posterior insula (dpIns) in pain. Tract tracing studies in animals identify a similar region as fundamental to nociception, which suggests the dpIns is its human homolog and, as such, a potential therapeutic target."

The inversion interacts with dsx to control mimetic coloration patterns in an allele-specific manner. In Batesian mimicry, animals avoid predation by resembling distasteful models. In the swallowtail butterfly Papilio polytes, only mimetic-form females resemble the unpalatable butterfly Pachliopta aristolochiae. A recent report showed that a single gene, doublesex (dsx), controls this mimicry1; however, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we determined two whole-genome sequences of P. polytes and a related species, Papilio xuthus, identifying a single ∼130-kb autosomal inversion, including dsx, between mimetic (H-type) and non-mimetic (h-type) chromosomes in P. polytes. This inversion is associated with the mimicry-related locus H, as identified by linkage mapping. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that female-specific dsx isoforms expressed from the inverted H allele (dsx(H)) induce mimetic coloration patterns and simultaneously repress non-mimetic patterns. In contrast, dsx(h) does not alter mimetic patterns. We propose that dsx(H) switches the coloration of predetermined wing patterns and that female-limited polymorphism is tightly maintained by chromosomal inversion."

https://openalex.org/W2086200773,"Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved behavioral state whose regulation is poorly understood. A classical model posits that sleep is regulated by homeostatic and circadian mechanisms. Several factors have been implicated in mediating the homeostatic regulation of sleep, but molecules underlying the circadian mechanism are unknown. Here we use animals lacking melatonin due to mutation of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (aanat2) to show that melatonin is required for circadian regulation of sleep in zebrafish. Sleep is dramatically reduced at night in aanat2 mutants maintained in light/dark conditions, and the circadian regulation of sleep is abolished in free-running conditions. We find that melatonin promotes sleep downstream of the circadian clock as it is not required to initiate or maintain circadian rhythms. Additionally, we provide evidence that melatonin may induce sleep in part by promoting adenosine signaling, thus potentially linking circadian and homeostatic control of sleep."

We further investigate the relationship between a) the presence and b) the level of colonisation of each bacterial species with site and stage of disease, age, gender, ethnicity and MSI-status. With the exception of S. gallolyticus, we detected all bacteria profiled here in both tumour and normal samples at varying frequencies. ETBF (FDR = 0.001 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples) and afaC-positive E. coli (FDR = 0.03, normal samples) were significantly enriched in the colon compared to the rectum. ETBF (FDR = 0.04 and 0.002 for normal and tumour samples, respectively) and Fusobacterium spp. (FDR = 0.03 tumour samples) levels were significantly higher in late stage (III/IV) colorectal cancers. Fusobacterium was by far the most common bacteria detected, occurring in 82% and 81% of paired tumour and normal samples. Fusobacterium was also the only bacterium that was significantly higher in tumour compared to normal samples (p = 6e-5). We also identified significant associations between high-level colonisation by Fusobacterium and MSI-H (FDR = 0.05), age (FDR = 0.03) or pks-positive E. coli (FDR = 0.01). Furthermore, we exclusively identified atypical EPEC in our cohort, which has not been previously reported in association with colorectal cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2017495352,"Binge alcohol drinking is a tremendous public health problem because it leads to the development of numerous pathologies, including alcohol abuse and anxiety. It is thought to do so by hijacking brain systems that regulate stress and reward, including neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The central actions of NPY and CRF have opposing functions in the regulation of emotional and reward-seeking behaviors; thus, dysfunctional interactions between these peptidergic systems could be involved in the development of these pathologies. We used converging physiological, pharmacological and chemogenetic approaches to identify a precise neural mechanism in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a limbic brain region involved in pathological reward and anxiety behaviors, underlying the interactions between NPY and CRF in the regulation of binge alcohol drinking in both mice and monkeys. We found that NPY Y1 receptor (Y1R) activation in the BNST suppressed binge alcohol drinking by enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission specifically in CRF neurons via a previously unknown Gi-mediated, PKA-dependent postsynaptic mechanism. Furthermore, chronic alcohol drinking led to persistent alterations in Y1R function in the BNST of both mice and monkeys, highlighting the enduring, conserved nature of this effect across mammalian species. Together, these data provide both a cellular locus and signaling framework for the development of new therapeutics for treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, including alcohol use disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2094513549,"Purpose This study aimed to determine the expression and clinical significance of proteins that are involved in lipid metabolism in human breast tumors. Methods Tumors from 476 breast cancer patients were used to construct tissue microarrays. Then, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), Perilipin 1 (PLIN1), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA (CPT-1A), acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX-1), and fatty acid synthase (FASN) was performed on these microarrays. Results Breast tumors were classified into 4 subtypes: luminal A (n = 242; 50.8%), luminal B (n = 134; 28.2%), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (n = 50; 10.5%), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (n = 50; 10.5%). The expression of PLIN1 (p < 0.001), FABP4 (p = 0.029), CPT-1A (p = 0.001), ACOX-1 (p < 0.001), and FASN (p < 0.001) differed significantly among these tumor subtypes. Notably, PLIN1, CPT-1A, and FASN expression was highest in HER2 tumors and lowest in TNBC tumors. Similarly, the expression of FABP4 and ACOX-1 was highest in HER2 tumors and lowest in luminal A tumors. In addition, ACOX-1 positivity was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (p = 0.018). When tumor subtype was considered, FABP4 positivity was associated with significantly shorter disease-free survival (p = 0.005) and overall survival (p = 0.041) in TNBC. Conclusion Lipid metabolism-related proteins are differentially expressed in different IHC subtypes of breast cancer and some are associated with decreased survival rates."
https://openalex.org/W2001172144,"Objectives Infection remains a leading cause of post-transfusion mortality and morbidity. Bacterial contamination is, however, detected in less than 0.1% of blood units tested. The aim of the study was to identify viable bacteria in standard blood-pack units, with particular focus on bacteria from the oral cavity, and to determine the distribution of bacteria revealed in plasma and in the red blood cell (RBC)-fraction. Design Cross-sectional study. Blood were separated into plasma and RBC-suspensions, which were incubated anaerobically or aerobically for 7 days on trypticase soy blood agar (TSA) or blue lactose plates. For identification colony PCR was performed using primers targeting 16S rDNA. Setting Blood donors attending Capital Region Blood Bank, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Hvidovre, Denmark, October 29th to December 10th 2013. Participants 60 donors (≥50 years old), self-reported medically healthy. Results Bacterial growth was observed on plates inoculated with plasma or RBCs from 62% of the blood donations. Growth was evident in 21 (35%) of 60 RBC-fractions and in 32 (53%) of 60 plasma-fractions versus 8 of 60 negative controls (p = 0.005 and p = 2.6x10-6, respectively). Propionibacterium acnes was found in 23% of the donations, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 38%. The majority of bacteria identified in the present study were either facultative anaerobic (59.5%) or anaerobic (27.8%) species, which are not likely to be detected during current routine screening. Conclusions Viable bacteria are present in blood from donors self-reported as medically healthy, indicating that conventional test systems employed by blood banks insufficiently detect bacteria in plasma. Further investigation is needed to determine whether routine testing for anaerobic bacteria and testing of RBC-fractions for adherent bacteria should be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2005951463,"Background In recent years various studies showed, that hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a growing public health problem in many developed countries. Therefore, HEV infections might bear a transmission risk by blood transfusions. The clinical relevance still requires further investigations. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of acute HEV infections in Upper Austrian blood donors as well as a risk estimation of this transfusion-related infection. Methods and Findings A total of 58,915 blood donors were tested for HEV RNA using a commercial HEV RT-PCR Kit. 7 of these donors (0.01%) were PCR-positive with normal laboratory parameters in absence of clinical signs of hepatitis. Viral load determined by quantitative real-time PCR showed a HEV nucleic acid concentration of 2,217 293,635 IU/ml. At follow-up testing (2–11 weeks after donation) all blood donors had negative HEV RNA results. Additionally, genotyping was performed by amplification and sequencing of the ORF1 or ORF2 region of the HEV genome. All HEV RNA positive donor samples revealed a genotype 3 isolate. For the antibody screening, anti-HEV IgM and IgG were detected by ELISA. Follow up serological testing revealed that no donor was seropositive for HEV IgM or IgG antibodies at time of donation. Moreover, we verified the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG in 1,203 of the HEV RNA negative tested blood donors. Overall 13.55% showed positive results for anti-HEV IgG. Conclusions In the presented study, we investigated HEV infections in blood donations of Upper Austria over 1 year. We concluded that 1 out of 8,416 blood donations is HEV RNA positive. Seroprevalence of anti HEV IgG results in an age-related increase of 13.55%. Therefore, based on this data, we recommend HEV-PCR screening to prevent transmission of hepatitis E virus by transfusion."

We found that Parkin translocated to mitochondria in mouse livers after APAP treatment followed by mitochondrial protein ubiquitination and mitophagy induction.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved process that results in degradation of cellular proteins and organelles due to a cell's “self-eating.” In addition to providing the cell with nutrients and energy in response to starvation, this process rids the cell of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles through the formation of double-membrane autophagosomes. Autophagosomes can engulf individual organelles, protein aggregates, or portions of cytoplasm before fusing with lysosomes to degrade their contents (5Parzych K.R. Klionsky D.J. An overview of autophagy: morphology, mechanism, and regulation.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 20: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a protective process that can be either selective or nonselective. Nonselective autophagy occurs during starvation to break down the cell's components to provide a source of energy and nutrients. Selective autophagy occurs in nutrient-rich or -poor conditions as a protective mechanism by ridding the cell of protein aggregates and damaged organelles (6Reggiori F. Komatsu M. Finley K. Simonsen A. Selective types of autophagy.Int. J. Cell Biol. 2012; 2012: 156272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mitophagy is a selective form of autophagy that is specific for removal of damaged mitochondria, and mitophagy has been shown in vitro to be mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. Parkin is recruited to damaged mitochondria by phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1) to initiate their removal by mitophagy by performing Lys-48 and Lys-63 ubiquitination of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins (7Chan N.C.

Parkin-induced mitophagy is mainly known for its protective role in the brain because loss of Parkin has been linked to autosomal recessive parkinsonism (13Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Mutations in the parkin gene cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism.Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4166) Google Scholar). We recently found that Parkin is also ubiquitously expressed in several tissues in the mouse, including the liver (14Ding W.X. Yin X.M. Mitophagy: mechanisms, pathophysiological roles, and analysis.Biol. Chem. 2012; 393: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of Parkin in mitophagy induction as a mechanism of protection in APAP-induced liver injury. We found that Parkin-induced mitophagy is likely a mechanism of protection in APAP-induced liver injury because Parkin translocated to mitochondria and increased the level of mitochondrial protein ubiquitination after APAP treatment. However, we surprisingly found that Parkin knock-out (KO) mice also had mitophagy in their livers after APAP treatment likely due to other compensatory mechanisms. In addition, Parkin KO mice were protected against APAP-induced liver injury compared with wild type (WT) mice. Mechanistically, we found that Parkin KO mice had decreased activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), increased induction of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1) expression, and increased proliferation, which are all known important factors in mediating APAP-induced necrosis and liver injury. In contrast to chronic deletion of Parkin, acute knockdown of Parkin in mouse livers resulted in reduced mitophagy and Mcl-1 expression but increased JNK activation after APAP administration, which exacerbated APAP-induced liver injury. Our results thus revealed that chronic deletion (KO) and acute knockdown of Parkin differentially regulate APAP-induced mitophagy and liver injury in mice. APAP was purchased from Sigma (A7085), and the kit for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) measurement was purchased from Pointe Scientific (A7526-450). The following antibodies were used for Western blot analysis: anti-Parkin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-32282); anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-8017); anti-β-actin (Sigma, A5441); anti-Cyp2e1 (Abcam, ab19140); anti-cyclin D1 (Lab Vision, RB-9041); anti-phosphorylated JNK (Cell Signaling, 4668S); anti-phosphorylated GSK-3β (Ser-9) (Cell Signaling, 5558); anti-GSK-3α/β (Cell Signaling, 5696); anti-phosphorylated glycogen synthase (Cell Signaling, 4858);, anti-JNK (BD Biosciences, 554285); anti-CoxIV (Mitosciences, MS407); anti-Mcl-1 (Rockland, 600-401-394); anti-Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC11415); anti-cyclophilin D (Mitosciences, E0667); and anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 2118). The APAP-adduct antibody was a gift from Dr. Lance Pohl (National Institutes of Health) (15Ryan P.M. Bourdi M. Korrapati M.C. Proctor W.R. Vasquez R.A. Yee S.B. Quinn T.D. Chakraborty M. Pohl L.R. Endogenous interleukin-4 regulates glutathione synthesis following acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2012; 25: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Anti-PCNA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-56) was used for immunostaining. Horseradish peroxidase or biotin-conjugated antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Adenovirus (Ad)-negative shRNA and Ad shRNA for mouse Parkin were purchased from Vector Biolabs (Malvern, PA). WT C57BL/6J and whole body Parkin KO mice (C57BL/6J background, catalog no. 006582) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All animals received humane treatment, and all protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Eight- to 12-week-old male mice were treated with either 500 mg/kg APAP or saline by i.p. injection and were sacrificed 0.5, 1, 2, 6, or 24 h after treatment. To achieve knockdown of Parkin in mouse livers, 2-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were injected intravenously via tail vein with Ad-negative (Neg) shRNA or Ad-Parkin shRNA (1 × 109 PFU per mouse) for 4 days. Then the mice were further treated with either APAP (500 mg/kg) or saline by i.p. injection for 6 h. Liver injury was determined by measuring serum ALT. Formalin-fixed liver sections were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-μm sections before staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to determine liver cellular necrosis. Total liver lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer. Heavy membrane (HM) mainly enriched with mitochondria and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described previously (16Ding W.X. Ni H.M. DiFrancesca D. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Bid-dependent generation of oxygen radicals promotes death receptor activation-induced apoptosis in murine hepatocytes.Hepatology. 2004; 40: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, liver tissues were homogenized in HIM buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EGTA (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors) using a Dounce homogenizer as we described previously (16Ding W.X. Ni H.M. DiFrancesca D. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Bid-dependent generation of oxygen radicals promotes death receptor activation-induced apoptosis in murine hepatocytes.Hepatology. 2004; 40: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to separate HM and cytosolic fractions. The supernatant was kept as the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet containing the HM fraction was further washed by centrifugation and resuspended in HIM buffer. Protein (20–30 μg) was separated by a SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel before transfer to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were probed using the indicated primary and secondary antibodies and developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Formalin-fixed liver sections were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-μm, sections before staining with anti-PCNA antibody. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in ethanol followed by incubation in hydrogen peroxide to quench peroxidases. Tissues were then blocked using Ultra V-Block (Thermo Scientific, TA-125-UB) for 5 min and incubated with PCNA antibody (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were further incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min, and PCNA-positive cells were detected using ABC reagent (Vector, PK-6100) and DAB peroxidase substrate (Vector, SK-4105). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma, GHS132) for 30 s. Six fields at ×200 magnification were quantified for PCNA-positive cells per tissue, and results were expressed as percent PCNA-positive hepatocytes. As described previously (3Ni H.M. Bockus A. Boggess N. Jaeschke H. Ding W.X. Activation of autophagy protects against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.Hepatology. 2012; 55: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), murine hepatocytes were isolated from WT and Parkin KO mice by a retrograde, non-recirculating perfusion of livers with 0.05% collagenase type IV (Sigma). Cells were cultured in William's medium E with 10% fetal bovine serum but no other supplements for 2 h for attachment. Cells were then cultured in the same medium without serum overnight before treatment. All cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. For assessing mitochondrial membrane potential, hepatocytes were first loaded with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (50 nm) for 15 min and then treated with APAP (0, 5, and 10 mm) for 8 h. Cells were further stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 5 min followed by fluorescence microscopy. For assessing necrosis, after APAP treatment, hepatocytes were stained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) for 5 min followed by fluorescence microscopy. Caspase-3 activity was determined using acetyl-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin fluorescent substrate (Enzo) and 20 μg of protein from mouse liver lysates after treatment with saline or APAP as we described previously (16Ding W.X. Ni H.M. DiFrancesca D. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Bid-dependent generation of oxygen radicals promotes death receptor activation-induced apoptosis in murine hepatocytes.Hepatology. 2004; 40: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Liver lysate from an Atg5 KO mouse was used as a positive control (17Ni H.M. Boggess N. McGill M.R. Lebofsky M. Borude P. Apte U. Jaeschke H. Ding W.X. Liver-specific loss of Atg5 causes persistent activation of Nrf2 and protects against acetaminophen-induced liver injury.Toxicol. Sci. 2012; 127: 438-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). GSH and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels in liver tissue were measured using a modified Tietze assay (18Jaeschke H. Mitchell J.R. Use of isolated perfused organs in hypoxia and ischemia/reperfusion oxidant stress.Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For GSH measurement, liver tissues were homogenized in sulfosalicylic acid (3%) followed by centrifugation and dilution in potassium phosphate buffer. Samples were then subjected to a cycling reaction using glutathione reductase and dithionitrobenzoic acid, and GSH levels were determined by spectrophotometry. For GSSG, reduced GSH was removed using N-ethylmaleimide, and the GSSG measurement was performed using a similar spectrophotometry method as for GSH. Proteasome activity was determined using a succinyl-LLVY-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin substrate (Enzo) for 20 S proteasome and 20 μg of protein from mouse liver lysates after treatment with saline or APAP as we described previously (19Williams J.A. Hou Y. Ni H.M. Ding W.X. Role of intracellular calcium in proteasome inhibitor-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and cell death.Pharm. Res. 2013; 30: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tissues were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) followed by 1% OsO4. After dehydration, thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for observation under a JEM 1016CX electron microscope. Statistical analysis was conducted with Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance where appropriate. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. During Parkin-mediated mitophagy in cultured cells, it is known that Parkin translocates from the cytosol to depolarized mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial degradation (12Vives-Bauza C. Zhou C.

Nix is critical to two distinct phases of mitophagy, reactive oxygen species-mediated autophagy induction and Parkin-ubiquitin-p62-mediated mitochondrial priming.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27879-27890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). We previously showed that APAP administration induces mitophagy in mouse livers (3Ni H.M. Bockus A. Boggess N. Jaeschke H. Ding W.X. Activation of autophagy protects against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.Hepatology. 2012; 55: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of Parkin in mitophagy induction in the liver after APAP treatment. We first treated WT mice with APAP (500 mg/kg) for 6 h and determined Parkin translocation to mitochondria by Western blot analysis using cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Parkin translocated to mitochondria after APAP treatment, which was accompanied by increased ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins, suggesting that Parkin may play a role in APAP-induced mitophagy (Fig. 1A). To determine whether Parkin-induced mitophagy was a protective mechanism against APAP-induced liver injury, we treated WT and Parkin KO mice with APAP (500 mg/kg) for 6 and 24 h. We expected Parkin KO mice to have increased liver injury after APAP treatment due to an inability to induce mitophagy. However, we surprisingly found that Parkin KO mice were protected from APAP-induced liver injury compared with WT mice (Fig. 1, B and C). Parkin KO mice had significantly less liver injury compared with WT mice after APAP treatment for 6 and 24 h as determined by serum ALT levels. WT mice had a mean serum ALT of 5309 units/liter at 6 h and 8290 units/liter at 24 h, and KO mice had a mean serum ALT of 2813 units/liter at 6 h and 2649 units/liter at 24 h (Fig. 1B). WT mice also had a significantly greater area of hepatocellular necrosis than KO mice after APAP treatment for 6 and 24 h as determined by H&E staining. Saline-treated WT and Parkin KO mice did not develop any cellular necrosis (Fig. 1C). APAP is well known to induce cell death via necrosis and not apoptosis (22McGill M.R. Jaeschke H. Metabolism and disposition of acetaminophen: recent advances in relation to hepatotoxicity and diagnosis.Pharm. Res. 2013; 30: 2174-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), so we ensured that protection in Parkin KO mice was not due to APAP induction of cell death via apoptosis instead of necrosis by assessing caspase-3 activity in liver tissue lysates. Neither WT nor Parkin KO mice had any induction of caspase-3 activity after APAP treatment, indicating that APAP did not induce apoptosis in WT or Parkin KO mice, as expected. Lysate from an Atg5 KO mouse was used as a positive control for caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1D). APAP is metabolized primarily by Cyp2e1 to its reactive metabolite NAPQI, which is detoxified by GSH at therapeutic doses. GSH is depleted during APAP overdose, which allows for NAPQI to form protein adducts and induce mitochondrial damage and subsequent hepatocellular necrosis (22McGill M.R. Jaeschke H. Metabolism and disposition of acetaminophen: recent advances in relation to hepatotoxicity and diagnosis.Pharm. Res. 2013; 30: 2174-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).To ensure that protection in KO mice was not due to differences in APAP metabolism, we treated WT and Parkin KO mice with APAP (500 mg/kg) or saline control and measured GSH levels 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 24 h after treatment. WT and Parkin KO mice had similar basal levels of GSH and similar GSH depletion at 0.5, 1, and 2 h after APAP treatment. WT and Parkin KO mice also had similar recovery of GSH after APAP treatment for 6 and 24 h (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, WT and Parkin KO mice had similar levels of protein adducts and Cyp2e1 protein expression after APAP or saline treatment for 6 h (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that protection in Parkin KO mice was not due to differences in metabolism of APAP between WT and Parkin KO mice. GSSG levels and the ratio of GSSG to GSH are markers of oxidative stress. WT and Parkin KO mice had similar basal GSSG levels and GSSG to GSH ratio. WT and Parkin KO mice also had similar GSSG levels and GSSG to GSH ratios after APAP treatment for 0.5, 1, 2, and 6 h. Parkin KO mice had slightly less GSSG than WT mice after APAP treatment for 24 h, but the decrease in KO mice was not significant compared with WT mice (Fig. 2, C and D). These results suggest that differences in injury between WT and Parkin KO mice were not due to differences in oxidative stress. We compared and quantified the number of autophagosomes and lysosomes containing mitochondria (hereafter referred to as mitophagosomes) by electron microscopy (EM) between WT and Parkin KO mice after APAP treatment. We also performed an autophagy flux assay with a combination of APAP and chloroquine (CQ) treatment. CQ blocks lysosome degradation, which allows for accurate quantification of autophagosome and lysosome components (23Klionsky D.J. Abdalla F.C. Abeliovich H. Abraham R.T. Acevedo-Arozena A. Adeli K. Agholme L. Agnello M. Agostinis P. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Ahn H.J. Ait-Mohamed O. Ait-Si-Ali S. Akematsu T. Akira S. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.Autophagy. 2012; 8: 445-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). Treatment with APAP significantly increased the number of mitophagosomes, which was further enhanced in the presence of CQ in WT mice, indicating that APAP induces mitophagy flux in mouse livers. Surprisingly, Parkin KO mice also had an increased number of mitophagosomes, which was also further enhanced by the presence of CQ treatment, although the number of mitophagosomes was lower compared with WT mice (Fig. 3, A and B). WT and Parkin KO mice also showed slight degradation of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom20 as well as the mitochondrial matrix protein cyclophilin D after APAP treatment (Fig. 3, C–E). We recently reported that APAP treatment in mice causes distinctive mitochondrial changes within different zones of the mouse liver. In addition to mitophagy, APAP also induces mitochondrial biogenesis adjacent to the necrotic areas likely to promote liver repair (4Ni H.M. Williams J.A. Jaeschke H. Ding W.X. Zonated induction of autophagy and mitochondrial spheroids limits acetaminophen-induced necrosis in the liver.Redox Biol. 2013; 1: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This could offset the levels of mitochondrial degradation mediated by mitophagy using the total liver lysates. A better quantitative approach, such as the use of micro-dissection to isolate tissues from different zones of the liver, may need to be established in the future. Taken together, these results indicate that APAP may induce mitophagy in mouse livers through Parkin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Activation of JNK by phosphorylation and its translocation to the mitochondria are well known to exacerbate APAP-induced liver injury (24Gunawan B.K. Liu Z.X. Han D. Hanawa N. Gaarde W.A.

Pharmacol. 2010; 246: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To determine whether WT and Parkin KO mice had differences in JNK activation, we measured protein levels of phosphorylated JNK (pJNK) in WT and Parkin KO mouse livers after APAP treatment for 2 and 6 h. Parkin KO mice had slightly less JNK activation 2 h after APAP treatment compared with WT mice, and JNK activation was significantly less in Parkin KO mice compared with WT mice 6 h after APAP treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). WT and Parkin KO mice had similar levels of total JNK protein expression (Fig. 4A). In addition, we investigated mitochondrial JNK activation using cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from WT and Parkin KO mouse liver lysates after APAP treatment for 6 h. We found that JNK translocated to mitochondria after APAP treatment, and the level of total JNK levels on mitochondria was surprisingly higher in Parkin KO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4, C and D). However, the active form of JNK (pJNK) on mitochondria was much lower in Parkin KO mice compared with WT mice after APAP treatment (Fig. 4, C and D). There results suggest that Parkin may promote JNK activation once it is translocated to mitochondria, and the regulation of mitochondrial JNK translocation is independent of Parkin. Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein that has been shown to be protective against APAP-induced liver injury (28Sharma M. Gadang V. Jaeschke A.

IH-evoked HIF-1α synthesis and stability are due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidases, especially Nox2. However, the mechanisms by which IH activates Nox2 are not known. We recently reported that IH activates xanthine oxidase (XO) and the resulting increase in ROS elevates intracellular calcium levels. Since Nox2 activation requires increased intracellular calcium levels, we hypothesized XO-mediated calcium signaling contributes to Nox activation by IH. We tested this possibility in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells subjected to IH consisting alternating cycles of hypoxia (1.5% O2 for 30 sec) and normoxia (21% O2 for 5 min). Kinetic analysis revealed that IH-induced XO preceded Nox activation. Inhibition of XO activity either by allopurinol or by siRNA prevented IH-induced Nox activation, translocation of the cytosolic subunits p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane and their interaction with gp91phox. ROS generated by XO also contribute to IH-evoked Nox activation via calcium-dependent protein kinase C stimulation. More importantly, silencing XO blocked IH-induced upregulation of HIF-1α demonstrating that HIF-1α activation by IH requires Nox2 activation by XO."

Incorporation of Ni2+ into the active site of urease requires a battery of chaperones. Both metallochaperones UreE and UreG play important roles in the urease activation. In this study, we demonstrate that, in the presence of GTP and Mg2+, UreG binds Ni2+ with an affinity (Kd) of ∼0.36 μm. The GTPase activity of Ni2+-UreG is stimulated by both K+ (or NH4+) and HCO3− to a biologically relevant level, suggesting that K+/NH4+ and HCO3− might serve as GTPase elements of UreG. We show that complexation of UreE and UreG results in two protein complexes, i.e. 2E-2G and 2E-G, with the former being formed only in the presence of both GTP and Mg2+. Mutagenesis studies reveal that Arg-101 on UreE and Cys-66 on UreG are critical for stabilization of 2E-2G complex. Combined biophysical and bioassay studies show that the formation of 2E-2G complex not only facilitates nickel transfer from UreE to UreG, but also enhances the binding of GTP. This suggests that UreE might also serve as a structural scaffold for recruitment of GTP to UreG. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that UreE serves as a bridge to grasp Ni2+ from HypA, subsequently donating it to UreG.

Cover T.L. Binding and internalization of the Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin by epithelial cells.Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological activities for survival in an extreme acidic environment consume huge amounts of energy, and thus H. pylori produces [Ni,Fe]-hydrogenase to oxidize molecular hydrogen to obtain sufficient energy (4Maier R.J. Fu C. Gilbert J. Moshiri F. Olson J. Plaut A.G. Hydrogen uptake hydrogenase in Helicobacter pylori.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 141: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the survival and successful colonization of H. pylori in human stomach largely rely on the proper function of two enzymes, i.e. urease (5Evans Jr., D.J. Evans D.G. Kirkpatrick S.S. Graham D.Y. Characterization of the Helicobacter pylori urease and purification of its subunits.Microb. Pathog. 1991; 10: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and [Ni,Fe]-hydrogenase (6Li Y. Zamble D.B. Nickel homeostasis and nickel regulation: an overview.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 4617-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Maturation of both urease and [Ni,Fe]-hydrogenase refers to the assembly of nickel-containing active centers (7Zambelli B. Musiani F. Benini S. Ciurli S.

Metallocenter assembly of the hydrogenase enzymes.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The utilization of nickel must be tightly controlled in H. pylori as a plethora of nickel causes serious cell damage to H. pylori (9Carter E.L. Flugga N. Boer J.L. Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. Interplay of metal ions and urease.Metallomics. 2009; 1: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, H. pylori has developed an elaborate system to tightly regulate the cellular nickel homeostasis from uptake, storage, and delivery to efflux through biosynthesis of a series of metalloproteins and chaperones (10Sydor A.M. Zamble D.B. Nickel metallomics: general themes guiding nickel homeostasis.Met.

The proper assembly of the metal-containing active site of [Ni,Fe]-hydrogenase depends on a group of accessory proteins (HypA, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F) (8Leach M.R. Zamble D.B.

HpHypB is classified into the P-loop GTPase family with its enzymatic activity being activated by potassium (24Sydor A.M. Lebrette H. Ariyakumaran R. Cavazza C. Zamble D.B.

It is commonly believed that HypA and HypB are involved in the nickel insertion into the large subunit of hydrogenase (19Olson J.W. Mehta N.S. Maier R.J.

Interaction between hydrogenase maturation factors HypA and HypB is required for [NiFe]-hydrogenase maturation.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e32592Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, SlyD, a protein that binds Ni2+ at its C terminus (28Cheng T. Li H. Xia W. Sun H. Multifaceted SlyD from Helicobacter pylori: implication in [NiFe] hydrogenase maturation.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2012; 17: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), might also participate in hydrogenase maturation through interaction with HypB (29Leach M.R. Zhang J.W. Zamble D.B.

Nickel binding and[NiFe]-hydrogenase maturation by the metallochaperone SlyD with a single metal-binding site in Escherichia coil.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 417: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The IF (insert-in-flap) domain of SlyD is responsible for the SlyD-HypB interaction, facilitating nickel transfer from the C terminus of SlyD to HypB in H. pylori (31Cheng T. Li H. Yang X. Xia W. Sun H. Interaction of SlyD with HypB of Helicobacter pylori facilitates nickel trafficking.Metallomics. 2013; 5: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but stimulates nickel release from HypB in Escherichia coli (29Leach M.R.

Chem. 2007; 282: 16177-16186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both HypA and HypB are also involved in urease maturation (19Olson J.W. Mehta N.S. Maier R.J. Requirement of nickel metabolism proteins HypA and HypB for full activity of both hydrogenase and urease in Helicobacter pylori.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 26Mehta N. Olson J.W. Maier R.J.

Nickel enzyme maturation in Helicobacter hepaticus: roles of accessory proteins in hydrogenase and urease activities.Microbiology. 2007; 153: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating a cross-talk between urease and hydrogenase maturation processes. Maturation of urease involves the proper insertion of two nickel ions to its active site and requires at least four accessory proteins (UreE, -F, -G, -H) (9Carter E.L. Flugga N. Boer J.L. Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. Interplay of metal ions and urease.Metallomics. 2009; 1: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, accessory proteins for [Ni,Fe]-hydrogenase were also reported to be involved in the process (19Olson J.W. Mehta N.S. Maier R.J. Requirement of nickel metabolism proteins HypA and HypB for full activity of both hydrogenase and urease in Helicobacter pylori.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Benoit S.L. Zbell A.L. Maier R.J. Nickel enzyme maturation in Helicobacter hepaticus: roles of accessory proteins in hydrogenase and urease activities.Microbiology. 2007; 153: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). UreE can form a ternary complex with HypA, consisting of one UreE dimer and one HypA monomer. Such an interaction facilitates nickel translocation from HypA to UreE and enhances urease activity (32Yang X. Li H. Cheng T. Xia W. Lai Y.-T. Sun H. Nickel translocation between metallochaperones HypA and UreE in Helicobacter pylori.Metallomics. 2014; 6: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maturation of urease in H. pylori is not well understood. The formation of apo-urease-(UreG/UreF/UreH) was thought to be a crucial step for nickel insertion to urease (33Park I.S. Hausinger R.P. Metal ion interaction with urease and UreD-urease apoproteins.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5345-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Park I.S. Hausinger R.P. Evidence for the presence of urease apoprotein complexes containing UreD, UreF, and UreG in cells that are competent for in vivo enzyme activation.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that UreE-UreG complexation plays an important role in the maturation of apo-urease; however, the molecular mechanism of nickel transfer between the chaperones UreE and UreG is not fully understood. Previously, UreG from H. pylori was demonstrated to bind Zn2+, instead of Ni2+ (35Zambelli B. Turano P. Musiani F. Neyroz P. Ciurli S. Zn2+-linked dimerization of UreG from Helicobacter pylori, a chaperone involved in nickel trafficking and urease activation.Proteins. 2009; 74: 222-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of HpUreG in an UreG/F/H complex revealed the metal binding site, consisting of two cysteines and two histidines, which are located at the interface between two UreG monomers. The nickel binding induces GTP-dependent dimerization of UreG (36Fong Y.H. Wong H.C. Yuen M.H. Lau P.H. Chen Y.W. Wong K.B. Structure of UreG/UreF/UreH complex reveals how urease accessory proteins facilitate maturation of Helicobacter pylori urease.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001678Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A previous isothermal titration calorimetry study showed that H. pylori UreE and UreG form a (UreE)2-(UreG)2 complex (i.e. one UreE dimer with one UreG dimer, or as 2E-2G) and the Zn2+ but not Ni2+ binding stabilized the complex (37Bellucci M. Zambelli B. Musiani F. Turano P. Ciurli S. Helicobacter pylori UreE, a urease accessory protein: specific Ni2+- and Zn2+-binding properties and interaction with its cognate UreG.Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which is quite peculiar given the role of UreE and UreG in nickel delivery. Moreover, a previous study showed that in Klebsiella aerogenes, a (UreE)2-UreG (i.e. 2E-G, one UreE dimer with one UreG monomer) complex was observed (38Boer J.L. Quiroz-Valenzuela S. Anderson K.L. Hausinger R.P. Mutagenesis of Klebsiella aerogenes UreG to probe nickel binding and interactions with other urease-related proteins.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5859-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is not clear how nickel transfer is achieved through the interaction of UreE and UreG. In this study, we have overexpressed and purified UreG and UreE from H. pylori 26695. By using biochemical, biophysical, and molecular biology approaches, we characterize Ni2+ binding properties as well as GTPase activity of UreG. We also carried out detailed studies on the molecular mechanism of the interaction between UreE and UreG. We demonstrate that UreE and UreG form a 2E-2G complex, which preactivates GTPase of UreG through enhancement of GTP binding to facilitate Ni2+ transfer. The roles of UreE, UreG, and HypA in nickel delivery are examined and discussed. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs.

Li H. Cheng T. Xia W. Lai Y.-T. Sun H. Nickel translocation between metallochaperones HypA and UreE in Helicobacter pylori.Metallomics. 2014; 6: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ureG gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of H. pylori 26695 and inserted into pET28a after NdeI and EcoRI digest to generate the expression plasmid pET28a-ureG. pET28a-ureE(N100A), pET28a-ureE(R101A), pET28a-ureE(H102A), pET28a-ureE(152A), pET28a-ureG(C66A), and pET28a-ureG(H68A) were generated using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase. The ligation mixture was subsequently transformed into XL-1 Blue E. coli. All the plasmids were sequenced (BGI) to verify the proper gene sequences. The pET-UreA2HΔG used in urease activity was constructed by insertion of H. pylori urease operon (ureABIEFGH) into the pET-32a vector using the NdeI-EcoRI restriction sites and introduction of the deletion of ureG gene (ΔG) using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase. UreE and its variants were overexpressed and purified similarly as described previously (32Yang X. Li H. Cheng T. Xia W. Lai Y.-T. Sun H. Nickel translocation between metallochaperones HypA and UreE in Helicobacter pylori.Metallomics. 2014; 6: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To express UreG, a single clone of BL21 (DE3) E. coli harboring the pET28a-ureG expression vector was cultured in Luria Broth (LB) medium supplied with 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C for overnight. The bacteria cultured overnight were diluted 1:100 into 1 liter of LB medium containing a proper antibiotic for subculture at 37 °C for ∼2 h. Until it was grown to an optical density of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm, expression of His6-UreG fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. The cells were further cultured at 25 °C overnight (∼16 h). The following steps were carried out at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 30 min) and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Hepes containing 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) with 1 mm PMSF as an enzyme inhibitor. After cell lysis by sonication, supernatant was separated from pellets by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant was further filtered through Millex-HA filter (0.45 μm, 33 mm, Millipore) and loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) preloaded with nickel ion and pre-equilibrated by buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. Five column volumes of buffer A with 50 mm imidazole were used to wash away the unspecific binding impurities. The His6-UreG protein was eluted by buffer A supplemented with 300 mm imidazole. The eluted protein fraction was collected and loaded into a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated by buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) to remove excess imidazole for thrombin cleavage. Fusion protein was incubated with ∼50 NIH units of thrombin at 25 °C for 3 h with gentle shaking to cleave His6 tag from free UreG. Trace amounts of uncleaved fusion protein were removed by loading the digested protein sample to the 5-ml HisTrap column again. Fraction of flow-through was collected and incubated with 20 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT at 4 °C overnight to obtain the apo-form UreG protein, which was further purified by gel filtration using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) containing 500 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) 2The abbreviation used is: TCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine. as a reducing agent. Elution fractions of purified protein were collected and concentrated to ∼2 ml. UreG variants were purified similarly. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Novagen), and metal contents of the purified proteins were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Agilent 7500a). tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine. Nickel binding to UreG was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. All UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrometer using a 1-cm quartz cuvette at ambient temperature (∼25 °C). UV-visible spectra were scanned with a rate of 360 nm/min from 600 to 240 nm. Apo-UreG (20 μm) was freshly prepared in 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 500 μm TCEP, pH 7.2, with or without supplementation of 100 μm GTP/GDP and 1 mm Mg2+. Spectrum of the same buffer was used for baseline correction. Aliquots of nickel chloride stock solution (10 mm) were titrated into UreG sample with gentle mixing, and UV-visible spectra were recorded after a 10-min incubation at room temperature. For competition between the Ni2+ and Zn2+ experiments, UreG (20 μm) was freshly prepared in 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 500 μm TCEP, pH 7.2, in the presence of 40 μm Ni2+ or Zn2+, 100 μm GTP, and 1 mm Mg2+, and subsequently, Zn2+ or Ni2+ stock solutions were titrated into the above protein solution. The UV titration curves were fitted to the Ryan-Weber nonlinear equation (39Ryan D.K. Weber J.H. Fluorescence quenching titration for determination of complexing capacities and stability constants of fulvic acid.Anal. Chem. 1982; 54: 986-990Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar) I=Imax2Cp[(Kd+Cm+Cp)−(Cp+Cm+Kd)2−4CmCp] (Eq. 1)Eq. 1 where I stands for UV absorbance intensity; Imax stands for maximal UV absorbance; Cp and Cm refer to the total concentrations of proteins and ligands respectively; and Kd is the dissociation constant. To examine the nickel transfer between UreE and UreG, Ni-UreE (or its variants Ni-CUreE and Ni-UreE-R101A) was titrated stepwise into UreG (25 μm) in the presence of GTP (50 μm) and Mg2+ (1 mm). CUreE is the C-terminal domain of UreE and houses the metal binding site. Both CUreE and UreE-R101A preserve nickel binding ability similarly to the WT-UreE (data not shown). Similarly, Ni-UreE was titrated into UreG in the presence of 50 μm GTP but not Mg2+. To examine the nickel transfer from HypA to UreG via UreE, Ni-Zn-HypA and UreE or Ni-Zn-HypA alone was titrated stepwise into UreG (20 μm) in the presence of GTP (50 μm) and Mg2+ (1 mm). Analytical gel filtration chromatography was performed on an ÄKTA FPLC system using a Superdex 75 or 200 30/100 GL column (GE Healthcare) precalibrated with the low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Typically, 40 μm apo-UreG was preincubated with 1.5 molar eq of Ni2+/Zn2+, GTP/GDP, Mg2+, or their combinations for 15 min and subjected to analysis. The column was pre-equilibrated with Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 200 μm TCEP, pH 7.2). The molecular mass of the protein complex in the elution peaks was further measured by a multiple-angle laser light scattering detector (miniDAWN light scattering detector, Wyatt Technology) or a by DynaPro plate reader (Wyatt Technologies), and the data were analyzed by Astra version 5.3.4.18 (Wyatt Technology) or by the Dynamics software (Wyatt Technologies). To investigate the interaction among HypA, UreE, and UreG, 50 μm apo-UreG was preincubated with 50 μm apo-UreE and 300 μm Zn-HypA in the absence or presence of 75 μm GTP and MgSO4 (HypA protein was used in excess due to low absorption at 280 nm). The fractions of elution peaks were collected and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE assay to determine the components of peaks. GTPase activity of UreG was determined by the Malachite Green phosphate assay kit (Abcam). To compare the effect of K+, HCO3−, and KHCO3 on the GTPase activity of Ni-UreG, GTPase assay was carried out with the supplementation of KCl/NH4Cl, NaHCO3, or KHCO3/NH4HCO3 at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 mm, and the pH of the buffer was gently adjusted to be 7.5. GTP hydrolysis was triggered by the addition of Ni-UreG (10 μm) into KCl/NaHCO3/KHCO3/NH4HCO3 buffer with incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. To compare the GTPase activities of apo-UreG, Zn-UreG, and Ni-UreG at different pH, the GTPase assay was carried out in a series of buffers with different pH values supplemented with 10 mm KCl/NaHCO3/KHCO3. After incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, the free phosphate from hydrolysis of GTP determined by the kit was used to calculate the percentage of GTP turnover. Similarly, to compare the effect of HypA and UreE on GTPase activity of UreG, apo-UreG was prepared and supplemented with Ni-HypA, Ni-UreE, or Ni-HypA-UreE (10 μm for each protein) in GTPase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GTP, 1% glycerol, pH 7.5). Hydrolysis of GTP was triggered by the addition of 10 mm KHCO3. After incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, the free phosphate from hydrolysis of GTP was determined. For the time course reaction, a series of 400 μl of 10 μm UreG protein samples was prepared in GTPase assay buffer and was incubated with 10 mm KHCO3at 37 °C. For each time point, 50 μl of reaction mixtures was taken out to allow the free phosphate from hydrolysis of GTP to be determined. Those solutions containing 100 μm GTP but without UreG were also incubated as blank controls to eliminate the self-hydrolysis of GTP. To determine the enzyme kinetic parameters (Km, kcat) of UreG, similar experiments were carried out but with the substrate concentration varied. A series of 50 μl of 10 μm UreG protein samples containing various GTP concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 μm was prepared in GTPase assay buffer with 10 mm KHCO3. After incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, the amounts of free phosphate in the reaction mixtures were determined. The Michaelis-Menten equation was used to obtain kinetic parameters by nonlinear fitting. pET-UreA2HΔG was transformed into E. coli strain KMl603 (BL21(DE3) ΔslyD::kan (a gift from Prof. A. R. Davidson, University of Toronto)). The bacterial cells were cultured in Luria Broth with supplementation of 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C and induced at 25 °C overnight with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when A600 reached 0.8. Cells were collected and washed with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged to obtain supernatant. About 50 μl of lysate was mixed with 10 μm Ni-UreG/apo-UreG or 5 μm Ni2+. After supplementation of 250 μl of urea buffer (50 mm Hepes, 25 mm urea, pH 7.5) with or without 10 mm KHCO3, the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to activate urease.

Total protein concentration of lysate was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Novagen), and the unit of urease activity w"
https://openalex.org/W2096902953,"This study shows how somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons contribute to odor coding in mouse olfactory cortex. Odor-tuned SOM cells regulate neuronal output through a purely subtractive operation that is independent of odor identity or intensity. This operation enhances the salience of odor-evoked activity without changing cortical odor tuning. Diverse types of local GABAergic interneurons shape the cortical representation of sensory information. Here we show how somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOM cells) contribute to odor coding in mouse olfactory cortex. We find that odor-tuned SOM cells regulate principal cells through a purely subtractive operation that is independent of odor identity or intensity. This operation enhances the salience of odor-evoked activity without changing cortical odor tuning. SOM cells inhibit both principal cells and fast-spiking interneurons, indicating that subtractive inhibition reflects the interplay of multiple classes of interneurons."

Whether LAA morphology is associated with increased stroke/TIA risk is controversial and, if it does, which morphological type most predisposes to thrombus formation. We assessed LAA morphology in stroke patients with cryptogenic or suspected cardiogenic etiology and in age- and gender-matched healthy controls. LAA morphology and volume were analyzed by cardiac computed tomography in 111 patients (74 males; mean age 60 ± 11 years) with acute ischemic stroke of cryptogenic or suspected cardiogenic etiology other than known atrial fibrillation (AF). A subgroup of 40 patients was compared to an age- and gender-matched control group of 40 healthy individuals (21 males in each; mean age 54 ± 9 years). LAA was classified into four morphology types (Cactus, ChickenWing, WindSock, CauliFlower) modified with a quantitative qualifier. The proportions of LAA morphology types in the main stroke group, matched stroke subgroup, and control group were as follows: Cactus (9.0%, 5.0%, 20.0%), ChickenWing (23.4%, 37.5%, 10.0%), WindSock (47.7%, 35.0%, 67.5%), and CauliFlower (19.8%, 22.5%, 2.5%). The distribution of morphology types differed significantly (P<0.001) between the matched stroke subgroup and control group. The proportion of single-lobed LAA was significantly higher (P<0.001) in the matched stroke subgroup (55%) than the control group (6%). LAA volumes were significantly larger (P<0.001) in both stroke study groups compared to controls patients. To conclude, LAA morphology differed significantly between stroke patients and controls, and single-lobed LAAs were overrepresented and LAA volume was larger in patients with acute ischemic stroke of cryptogenic or suspected cardiogenic etiology."

ASK1 is a stress-responsive MAP3K that acts as an upstream kinase of p38 and is activated by various stresses, such as oxidative stress. Here, we show that NR4A2, a member of the NR4A nuclear receptor family, acts as a necrosis promoter downstream of ASK1-p38 pathway during oxidative stress. Although NR4A2 is well known as a nucleus-localized transcription factor, we found that it is translocated into the cytosol after phosphorylation by p38. Because the phosphorylation site mutants of NR4A2 cannot rescue the cell death-promoting activity, ASK1-p38 pathway-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic translocation of NR4A2 may be required for oxidative stress-induced cell death. In addition, NR4A2-mediated cell death does not depend on caspases and receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)-RIP3 complex, suggesting that NR4A2 promotes an RIP kinase-independent necrotic type of cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2091235289,"Diabetes-induced kidney cell injury involves an increase in matrix protein expression that is only partly alleviated by current treatment, prompting a search for new modalities. We have previously shown that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) inhibits high glucose-induced protein synthesis in kidney podocytes. We tested whether tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction, ameliorates high glucose stimulation of matrix proteins by generating H2S in podocytes. Tadalafil abrogated high glucose stimulation of global protein synthesis and matrix protein laminin γ1. Tadalafil inhibited high glucose-induced activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and laminin γ1 accumulation in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. Tadalafil increased AMPK phosphorylation by stimulating calcium-calmodulin kinase kinase β. Tadalafil rapidly increased the expression and activity of the H2S-generating enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) by promoting its translation. dl-Propargylglycine, a CSE inhibitor, and siRNA against CSE inhibited tadalafil-induced AMPK phosphorylation and abrogated the tadalafil effect on high glucose stimulation of laminin γ1. In tadalafil-treated podocytes, we examined the interaction between H2S and nitric oxide (NO). N(ω)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]-quinoxalin-1-one, inhibitors of NO synthase (NOS) and soluble guanylyl cyclase, respectively, abolished tadalafil induction of H2S and AMPK phosphorylation. Tadalafil rapidly augmented inducible NOS (iNOS) expression by increasing its mRNA, and siRNA for iNOS and 1400W, an iNOS blocker, inhibited tadalafil stimulation of CSE expression and AMPK phosphorylation. We conclude that tadalafil amelioration of high glucose stimulation of synthesis of proteins including matrix proteins in podocytes requires integration of the NO-H2S-AMPK axis leading to the inhibition of high glucose-induced mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 activity and mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W2087267131,"Chaperone/usher (CU) assembly pathway is used by a wide range of Enterobacteriaceae to assemble adhesive surface structures called pili or fimbriae that play a role in bacteria-host cell interactions. In silico analysis revealed that the genome of Klebsiella pneumoniae LM21 harbors eight chromosomal CU loci belonging to γκп and ϭ clusters. Of these, only two correspond to previously described operons, namely type 1 and type 3-encoding operons. Isogenic usher deletion mutants of K. pneumoniae LM21 were constructed for each locus and their role in adhesion to animal (Intestine 407) and plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) cells, biofilm formation and murine intestinal colonization was investigated. Type 3 pili usher deleted mutant was impaired in all assays, whereas type 1 pili usher deleted mutant only showed attenuation in adhesion to plant cells and in intestinal colonization. The LM21ΔkpjC mutant was impaired in its capacity to adhere to Arabidopsis cells and to colonize the murine intestine, either alone or in co-inoculation experiments. Deletion of LM21kpgC induced a significant decrease in biofilm formation, in adhesion to animal cells and in colonization of the mice intestine. The LM21∆kpaC and LM21∆kpeC mutants were only attenuated in biofilm formation and the adhesion abilities to Arabidopsis cells, respectively. No clear in vitro or in vivo effect was observed for LM21∆kpbC and LM21∆kpdC mutants. The multiplicity of CU loci in K. pneumoniae genome and their specific adhesion pattern probably reflect the ability of the bacteria to adhere to different substrates in its diverse ecological niches."
https://openalex.org/W2166792650,"The study investigated differences in the Five-Factor Model (FFM) domains and facets across adulthood. The main questions were whether personality scales reflected coherent units of trait development and thereby coherent personality traits more generally. These questions were addressed by testing if the components of the trait scales (items for facet scales and facets for domain scales) showed consistent age group differences. For this, measurement invariance (MI) framework was used. In a sample of 2,711 Estonians who had completed the NEO Personality Inventory 3 (NEO PI-3), more than half of the facet scales and one domain scale did not meet the criterion for weak MI (factor loading equality) across 12 age groups spanning ages from 18 to 91 years. Furthermore, none of the facet and domain scales met the criterion for strong MI (intercept equality), suggesting that items of the same facets and facets of the same domains varied in age group differences. When items were residualized for their respective facets, 46% of them had significant (p < 0.0002) residual age-correlations. When facets were residualized for their domain scores, a majority had significant (p < 0.002) residual age-correlations. For each domain, a series of latent factors were specified using random quarters of their items: scores of such latent factors varied notably (within domains) in correlations with age. We argue that manifestations of aetiologically coherent traits should show similar age group differences. Given this, the FFM domains and facets as embodied in the NEO PI-3 do not reflect aetiologically coherent traits."

These enzymes convert sphingolipid and lysolipid substrates to cyclic phosphates by activating a hydroxyl nucleophile present in both classes of lipid. The most medically relevant substrates are thought to be sphingomyelin and/or lysophosphatidylcholine. To better understand the substrate preference of these toxins, we used 31P NMR to compare the activity of three related but phylogenetically diverse sicariid toxins against a diverse panel of sphingolipid and lysolipid substrates. Two of the three showed significantly faster turnover of sphingolipids over lysolipids, and all three showed a strong preference for positively charged (choline and/or ethanolamine) over neutral (glycerol and serine) headgroups. Strikingly, however, the enzymes vary widely in their preference for choline, the headgroup of both sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine, versus ethanolamine. An enzyme from Sicarius terrosus showed a strong preference for ethanolamine over choline, whereas two paralogous enzymes from Loxosceles arizonica either preferred choline or showed no significant preference. Intrigued by the novel substrate preference of the Sicarius enzyme, we solved its crystal structure at 2.1 Å resolution. The evolution of variable substrate specificity may help explain the reduced dermonecrotic potential of some natural toxin variants, because mammalian sphingolipids use primarily choline as a positively charged headgroup; it may also be relevant for sicariid predatory behavior, because ethanolamine-containing sphingolipids are common in insect prey.

https://openalex.org/W2071911787,"Introduction Comparing multiple, diverse outcomes with cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is important, yet challenging in areas like palliative care where domains are unamenable to integration with survival. Generic multi-attribute utility values exclude important domains and non-health outcomes, while partial analyses—where outcomes are considered separately, with their joint relationship under uncertainty ignored—lead to incorrect inference regarding preferred strategies. Objective The objective of this paper is to consider whether such decision making can be better informed with alternative presentation and summary measures, extending methods previously shown to have advantages in multiple strategy comparison. Methods Multiple outcomes CEA of a home-based palliative care model (PEACH) relative to usual care is undertaken in cost disutility (CDU) space and compared with analysis on the cost-effectiveness plane. Summary measures developed for comparing strategies across potential threshold values for multiple outcomes include: expected net loss (ENL) planes quantifying differences in expected net benefit; the ENL contour identifying preferred strategies minimising ENL and their expected value of perfect information; and cost-effectiveness acceptability planes showing probability of strategies minimising ENL. Results Conventional analysis suggests PEACH is cost-effective when the threshold value per additional day at home (1) exceeds $1,068 or dominated by usual care when only the proportion of home deaths is considered. In contrast, neither alternative dominate in CDU space where cost and outcomes are jointly considered, with the optimal strategy depending on threshold values. For example, PEACH minimises ENL when 1=$2,000 and 2=$2,000 (threshold value for dying at home), with a 51.6% chance of PEACH being cost-effective. Conclusion Comparison in CDU space and associated summary measures have distinct advantages to multiple domain comparisons, aiding transparent and robust joint comparison of costs and multiple effects under uncertainty across potential threshold values for effect, better informing net benefit assessment and related reimbursement and research decisions."

Although previous studies have identified stem cells as the cell-of-origin for intestinal epithelial cells, no studies have directly compared stem cells derived from these anatomically distinct regions. Here, we examine intrinsic differences between primary epithelial cells isolated from human fetal small and large intestine, after in vitro expansion, using the Wnt agonist R-spondin 2. We utilized flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, gene expression analysis and a three-dimensional in vitro differentiation assay to characterize their stem cell properties. We identified stem cell markers that separate subpopulations of colony-forming cells in the small and large intestine and revealed important differences in differentiation, proliferation and disease pathways using gene expression analysis. Single cells from small and large intestine cultures formed organoids that reflect the distinct cellular hierarchy found in vivo and respond differently to identical exogenous cues. Our characterization identified numerous differences between small and large intestine epithelial stem cells suggesting possible connections to intestinal disease."
https://openalex.org/W1994369280,"The production of bacteriocins in response to worsening environmental conditions is one means of bacteria to outcompete other microorganisms. Colicins, one class of bacteriocins in Escherichia coli, are effective against closely related Enterobacteriaceae. Current research focuses on production, release and uptake of these toxins by bacteria. However, little is known about the quantitative aspects of these dynamic processes. Here, we quantitatively study expression dynamics of the Colicin E2 operon in E. coli on a single cell level using fluorescence time-lapse microscopy. DNA damage, triggering SOS response leads to the heterogeneous expression of this operon including the cea gene encoding the toxin, Colicin E2, and the cel gene coding for the induction of cell lysis and subsequent colicin release. Advancing previous whole population investigations, our time-lapse experiments reveal that at low exogenous stress levels all cells eventually respond after a given time (heterogeneous timing). This heterogeneous timing is lost at high stress levels, at which a synchronized stress response of all cells 60 min after induction via stress can be observed. We further demonstrate, that the amount of colicin released is dependent on cel (lysis) gene expression, independent of the applied exogenous stress level. A heterogeneous response in combination with heterogeneous timing can be biologically significant. It might enable a bacterial population to endure low stress levels, while at high stress levels an immediate and synchronized population wide response can give single surviving cells of the own species the chance to take over the bacterial community after the stress has ceased."

Almost 2 million children die from ARTIs each year, and most of them are from developing countries. The prevalence and correlation of pathogens in ARTIs are poorly understood, but are critical for improving case prevention, treatment, and management. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in children with ARTIs. A total of 39,756 children with one or more symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, herpangina, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, were enrolled in the study. All patients were hospitalized in Wuhan Children’s Hospital between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012, and were evaluated for infectious agents. Pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii, were screened simultaneously in patient blood samples using anti-pathogen IgM tests. Regression analysis was used to reveal correlations among the pathogens. Our results showed that one or more pathogens were identified in 10,206 patients, and that Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and influenza B virus were the leading infectious agents. Mixed-infections of pathogens were detected in 2,391 cases, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen. The most common agents in the co-infections were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza B virus. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. The prevalence of infectious agents in children with ARTIs was determined. Equations were established to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection. This revealed a linear correlation for pathogens in children with ARTIs. This study provides useful information for improving case prevention and management."

This enzyme induces primary cell proliferation and immortalization at low expression levels whereas it activates cancer barrier signaling through the p53-p21 pathway at high expression levels, causing growth arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Because previous reports suggested that the SOD3-induced reduction in the rates of cellular growth and migration also occurred in the absence of functional p53 signaling, in the current study we investigated the SOD3-induced growth-suppressive mechanisms in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. Based on our data, the robust over-expression of SOD3 increased the level of phosphorylation of the EGFR, ERBB2, RYK, ALK, FLT3, and EPHA10 receptor tyrosine kinases with the consequent downstream activation of the SRC, FYN, YES, HCK, and LYN kinases. However, pull-down experiments focusing on the small GTPase RAS, RAC, CDC42, and RHO revealed a reduced level of growth and migration signal transduction, such as the lack of stimulation of the mitogen pathway, in the SOD3 over-expressing cells, which was confirmed by MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 Western blotting analysis. Interestingly, the mRNA expression analyses indicated that SOD3 regulated the expression of guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (RHO GEF16, RAL GEF RGL1), GTPase-activating proteins (ARFGAP ADAP2, RAS GAP RASAL1, RGS4), and a Rho guanine nucleotide-disassociation inhibitor (RHO GDI 2) in a dose dependent manner, thus controlling signaling through the small G protein GTPases. Therefore, our current data may suggest the occurrence of dose-dependent SOD3-driven control of the GTP loading of small G proteins indicating a novel growth regulatory mechanism of this enzyme."

Eleven healthy subjects were scanned twice, with two sodium MRI acquisitions (with and without fluid suppression by inversion recovery), and two double inversion recovery (DIR) proton MRI. DIR MRIs were used to create masks of gray and white matter (GM, WM), that were subsequently applied to the C1 and α maps calculated from sodium MRI and a tissue three-compartment model, in order to measure the distributions of these two parameters in GM, WM or full brain (GM+WM) separately. The mean, median, mode, standard deviation (std), skewness and kurtosis of the C1 and α distributions in whole GM, WM and full brain were calculated for each subject, averaged over all data, and used as parameters for the repeatability assessment. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as a measure of reliability for the detection of intra-subject changes in C1 and αfor each parameter, while intraclass correlation (ICC) was used as a measure of repeatability. It was found that the CV of most of the parameters was around 10–20% (except for C1 kurtosis which is about 40%) for C1 and α measurements, and that ICC was moderate to very good (0.4 to 0.9) for C1 parameters and for some of the α parameters (mainly skewness and kurtosis). In conclusion, the proposed method could allow to reliably detect changes of 50% and above of the different measurement parameters of C1 and αin neuropathologies (multiple sclerosis, tumor, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease) compared to healthy subjects, and that skewness and kurtosis of the distributions of C1 and αseem to be the more sensitive parameters to these changes."

Here we use paleo-DNA to re-evaluate the historical status of yellow perch in the 6 million acre Adirondack State Park of northern New York. Yellow perch DNA in a 2200-year sediment record reveals a long-term native status for these supposedly alien fish and challenges assumptions that they necessarily exclude native trout from upland lakes. Similar approaches could be applied to other species with uncertain historical distributions and could help to identify unrecognized pockets of biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2035608017,"At our institute, a chemoradioselection strategy has been used to select patients for organ preservation on the basis of response to an initial 30-40 Gy concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Patients with a favorable response (i.e., chemoradioselected; CRS) have demonstrated better outcomes than those with an unfavorable response (i.e., nonchemoradioselected; N-CRS). Successful targeting of molecules that attenuate the efficacy of chmoradioselection may improve results. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of a novel cancer stem cell (CSC) marker, CD44 variant 9 (CD44v9), with cellular refractoriness to chemoradioselection in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Through a medical chart search, 102 patients with advanced HNSCC treated with chemoradioselection from 1997 to 2008 were enrolled. According to our algorithm, 30 patients were CRC following induction CCRT and 72 patients were N-CRS. Using the conventional immunohistochemical technique, biopsy specimens and surgically removed tumor specimens were immunostained with the anti-CD44v9 specific antibodies.The intrinsic expression levels of CD44v9 in the biopsy specimens did not correlate with the chemoradioselection and patient survival. However, in N-CRS patients, the CD44v9-positive group demonstrated significantly (P = 0.008) worse prognosis, than the CD44v9-negative group. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that among four candidate factors (T, N, response to CCRT, and CD44v9), CD44v9 positivity (HR: 3.145, 95% CI: 1.235-8.008, P = 0.0163) was significantly correlated with the poor prognosis, along with advanced N stage (HR: 3.525, 95% CI: 1.054-9.060, P = 0.0228). Furthermore, the survival rate of the CD44v9-induced group was significantly (P = 0.04) worse than the CD44v9-non-induced group.CCRT-induced CD44v9-expressing CSCs appear to be a major hurdle to chemoradioselection. CD44v9-targeting seems to be a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of chemoradioselection and consequent organ preservation and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2045949584,"Integrin α3β1 is highly expressed in both normal and tumorigenic epidermal keratinocytes where it regulates genes that control cellular function and extracellular matrix remodeling during normal and pathological tissue remodeling processes, including wound healing and development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Previous studies identified a role for α3β1 in immortalized and transformed keratinocytes in the regulation of genes that promote tumorigenesis, invasion, and pro-angiogenic crosstalk to endothelial cells. One such gene, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), is induced by α3β1 through a post-transcriptional mechanism of enhanced mRNA stability. In the current study, we sought to investigate the mechanism through which α3β1 controls MMP-9 mRNA stability. First, we utilized a luciferase reporter assay to show that AU-rich elements (AREs) residing within the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of the MMP-9 mRNA renders the transcript unstable in a manner that is independent of α3β1. Next, we cloned a truncated variant of the MMP-9 mRNA which is generated through usage of an alternative, upstream polyadenylation signal and lacks the 3’-UTR region containing the destabilizing AREs. Using an RNase protection assay to distinguish “long” (full-length 3’-UTR) and “short” (truncated 3’-UTR) MMP-9 mRNA variants, we demonstrated that the shorter, more stable mRNA that lacks 3’-UTR AREs was preferentially generated in α3β1-expressing keratinocytes compared with α3β1-deficient (i.e., α3-null) keratinocytes. Moreover, we determined that α3β1-dependent alternative polyadenylation was acquired by immortalized keratinocytes, as primary neonatal keratinocytes did not display α3β1-dependent differences in the long and short transcripts. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in α3β1-expressing keratinocytes caused a shift towards long variant expression, while Raf-1-mediated activation of ERK in α3-null keratinocytes dramatically enhanced short variant expression, indicating a role for ERK/MAPK signaling in α3β1-mediated selection of the proximal polyadenylation site. These findings identify a novel mode of integrin α3β1-mediated gene regulation through alternative polyadenylation."
https://openalex.org/W2068469659,"To explore restoration of ovarian function using epigenetically-related, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we functionally evaluated the epigenetic memory of novel iPSC lines, derived from mouse and human ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) using c-Myc, Klf4, Sox2 and Oct4 retroviral vectors. The stem cell identity of the mouse and human GC-derived iPSCs (mGriPSCs, hGriPSCs) was verified by demonstrating embryonic stem cell (ESC) antigen expression using immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR analysis, as well as formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) and teratomas that are capable of differentiating into cells from all three germ layers. GriPSCs’ gene expression profiles associate more closely with those of ESCs than of the originating GCs as demonstrated by genome-wide analysis of mRNA and microRNA. A comparative analysis of EBs generated from three different mouse cell lines (mGriPSCs; fibroblast-derived iPSC, mFiPSCs; G4 embryonic stem cells, G4 mESCs) revealed that differentiated mGriPSC-EBs synthesize 10-fold more estradiol (E2) than either differentiated FiPSC- or mESC-EBs under identical culture conditions. By contrast, mESC-EBs primarily synthesize progesterone (P4) and FiPSC-EBs produce neither E2 nor P4. Differentiated mGriPSC-EBs also express ovarian markers (AMHR, FSHR, Cyp19a1, ER and Inha) as well as markers of early gametogenesis (Mvh, Dazl, Gdf9, Boule and Zp1) more frequently than EBs of the other cell lines. These results provide evidence of preferential homotypic differentiation of mGriPSCs into ovarian cell types. Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that generating iPSCs from the desired tissue type may prove advantageous due to the iPSCs’ epigenetic memory."
https://openalex.org/W2004619677,"Background Cervical cancer screening is a critical health service that is often unavailable to women in under-resourced settings. In order to expand access to this and other reproductive and primary health care services, a South African non-governmental organization established a van-based mobile clinic in two rural districts in South Africa. To inform policy and budgeting, we conducted a cost evaluation of this service delivery model. Methods The evaluation was retrospective (October 2012–September 2013 for one district and April–September 2013 for the second district) and conducted from a provider cost perspective. Services evaluated included cervical cancer screening, HIV counselling and testing, syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), breast exams, provision of condoms, contraceptives, and general health education. Fixed costs, including vehicle purchase and conversion, equipment, operating costs and mobile clinic staffing, were collected from program records and public sector pricing information. The number of women accessing different services was multiplied by ingredients-based variable costs, reflecting the consumables required. All costs are reported in 2013 USD. Results Fixed costs accounted for most of the total annual costs of the mobile clinics (85% and 94% for the two districts); the largest contributor to annual fixed costs was staff salaries. Average costs per patient were driven by the total number of patients seen, at $46.09 and $76.03 for the two districts. Variable costs for Pap smears were higher than for other services provided, and some services, such as breast exams and STI and tuberculosis symptoms screening, had no marginal cost. Conclusions Staffing costs are the largest component of providing mobile health services to rural communities. Yet, in remote areas where patient volumes do not exceed nursing staff capacity, incorporating multiple services within a cervical cancer screening program is an approach to potentially expand access to health care without added costs."
https://openalex.org/W2015910168,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal of all genitourinary malignancies. Distant metastasis represents the major cause of death in patients with RCC. Recent studies have implicated the AAA+ ATPase pontin in many cellular activities that are highly relevant to carcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that pontin was up-regulated in RCC, and plays a previously unknown pro-invasive role in the metastatic progression of RCC through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. 28 pairs of freshly frozen clear cell RCC samples and the matched normal renal tissues analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting demonstrated that pontin was up-regulated in clear cell RCC tissues than in normal renal tissues. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate subcellular pontin expression in 95 RCC patients, and found that overexpression of pontin in cytoplasm positively correlated with the metastatic features, predicting unfavorable outcomes of RCC patients. Furthermore, in vitro experiments show pontin was predominantly expressed in cytoplasm of RCC cell lines, and a significant suppression of cell migration and invasion in pontin siRNA treated RCC cell lines was observed. Mechanistic studies show that pontin depletion up-regulated the E-cadherin protein and down-regulated vimentin protein, and decreased nuclear β-catenin expression, suggesting the involvement of EMT in pontin induced metastatic progression. Together, our data suggest pontin as a potential prognostic biomarker in RCC, and provide new promising therapeutic targets for clinical intervention of kidney cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2061949157,"BDNF and its specialized receptor TrkB are expressed in the developing lateral line system of zebrafish, but their role in this organ is unknown. To tackle this problem in vivo, we used transgenic animals expressing fluorescent markers in different cell types of the lateral line and combined a BDNF gain-of-function approach by BDNF mRNA overexpression and by soaking embryos in a solution of BDNF, with a loss-of-function approach by injecting the antisence ntrk2b-morpholino and treating embryos with the specific Trk inhibitor K252a. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that the BDNF-TrkB axis regulates migration of the lateral line primordium. In particular, BDNF-TrkB influences the expression level of components of chemokine signaling including Cxcr4b, and the generation of progenitors of mechanoreceptors, at the level of expression of Atoh1a-Atp2b1a."
https://openalex.org/W2064766131,"N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase-like protein (NAALADase L), encoded by the NAALADL1 gene, is a close homolog of glutamate carboxypeptidase II, a metallopeptidase that has been intensively studied as a target for imaging and therapy of solid malignancies and neuropathologies. However, neither the physiological functions nor structural features of NAALADase L are known at present. Here, we report a thorough characterization of the protein product of the human NAALADL1 gene, including heterologous overexpression and purification, structural and biochemical characterization, and analysis of its expression profile. By solving the NAALADase L x-ray structure, we provide the first experimental evidence that it is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase with a catalytic mechanism similar to that of glutamate carboxypeptidase II yet distinct substrate specificity. A proteome-based assay revealed that the NAALADL1 gene product possesses previously unrecognized aminopeptidase activity but no carboxy- or endopeptidase activity. These findings were corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis and identification of bestatin as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme. Analysis of NAALADL1 gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels revealed the small intestine as the major site of protein expression and points toward extensive alternative splicing of the NAALADL1 gene transcript. Taken together, our data imply that the NAALADL1 gene product's primary physiological function is associated with the final stages of protein/peptide digestion and absorption in the human digestive system. Based on these results, we suggest a new name for this enzyme: human ileal aminopeptidase (HILAP). Background: A protein product of the NAALADL1 gene is a homolog of glutamate carboxypeptidase II, a metallopeptidase studied as a promising theranostic cancer agent. Results: We solved the x-ray structure and analyzed the substrate specificity of the NAALADL1 gene product. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the protein represents a novel human ileal aminopeptidase. Significance: This study describes a novel enzyme involved in protein/peptide digestion in the small intestine and clarifies controversial previous reports."
https://openalex.org/W2044178246,"Genetic translocation of EWSR1 to ETS transcription factor coding region is considered as primary cause for Ewing sarcoma. Previous studies focused on the biology of chimeric transcription factors formed due to this translocation. However, the physiological consequences of heterozygous EWSR1 loss in these tumors have largely remained elusive. Previously, we have identified various mRNAs bound to EWS using PAR-CLIP. In this study, we demonstrate CCDC6, a known cell cycle regulator protein, as a novel target regulated by EWS. siRNA mediated down regulation of EWS caused an elevated apoptosis in cells in a CCDC6-dependant manner. This effect was rescued upon re-expression of CCDC6. This study provides evidence for a novel functional link through which wild-type EWS operates in a target-dependant manner in Ewing sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2043956422,"Ectromelia virus (ECTV) causes mousepox in mice, a disease very similar to smallpox in humans. ECTV and variola virus (VARV), the agent of smallpox, are closely related orthopoxviruses. Mousepox is an excellent small animal model to study the genetic and immunologic basis for resistance and susceptibility of humans to smallpox. Resistance to mousepox is dependent on a strong polarized type 1 immune response, associated with robust natural killer (NK) cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) responses. In contrast, ECTV-susceptible mice generate a type 2 response, associated with weak NK cell, CTL and IFN-γ responses but robust IL-4 responses. Nonetheless, susceptible strains infected with mutant ECTV lacking virus-encoded IFN-γ binding protein (vIFN-γbp) (ECTV-IFN-γbpΔ) control virus replication through generation of type 1 response. Since the IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways polarize type 2/T helper 2 (Th2) responses with a corresponding suppression of IFN-γ production, we investigated whether the combined absence of vIFN-γbp, and one or more host genes involved in Th2 response development, influence generation of protective immunity. Most mutant mouse strains infected with wild-type (WT) virus succumbed to disease more rapidly than WT animals. Conversely, the disease outcome was significantly improved in WT mice infected with ECTV-IFN-γbpΔ but absence of IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways did not provide any added advantage. Deficiency in IL-13 or STAT-6 resulted in defective CTL responses, higher mortality rates and accelerated deaths. Deficiencies in IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways significantly reduced the numbers of IFN-γ producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, indicating an absence of a switch to a Th1-like response. Factors contributing to susceptibility or resistance to mousepox are far more complex than a balance between Th1 and Th2 responses."
https://openalex.org/W2069866226,"In typical readers, orthographic knowledge has been shown to influence phonological decisions. In the present study, we used visual rhyme and spelling tasks to investigate the interaction of orthographic and phonological information in adults with varying reading skill. Word pairs that shared both orthography and phonology (e.g., throat/boat), differed in both orthography and phonology (e.g., snow/arm), shared only orthography (e.g., farm/warm), and shared only phonology (e.g., vote/boat) were visually presented to university students who varied in reading ability. For rhyme judgment, participants were slower and less accurate to accept rhyming pairs when words were spelled differently and to reject non-rhyming pairs when words were spelled similarly. Similarly, for spelling judgments, participants were slower and less accurate when indicating that word endings were spelled differently when words rhymed, and slower and less accurate when indicating that words were spelled similarly when words did not rhyme. Crucially, while these effects were clear at the group level, there were large individual differences in the extent to which participants were impacted by conflict. In two separate samples, reading skill was associated with the extent to which orthographic conflict impacted rhyme decisions such that individuals with better nonword reading performance were less impacted by orthographic conflict. Thus, university students with poorer reading skills may differ from their peers either in the reading strategies they use or in the degree to which they automatically access word form information. Understanding these relationships is important for understanding the roles that reading processes play in readers of different skill."
