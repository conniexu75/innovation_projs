These mechanisms rarely displace enough water to trigger transoceanic tsunamis. Violent volcanic explosions, however, can cause global tsunamis 1,5 by triggering acoustic-gravity waves 6–8 that excite the atmosphere–ocean interface. The colossal eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai volcano and ensuing tsunami is the first global volcano-triggered tsunami recorded by modern, worldwide dense instrumentation, thus providing a unique opportunity to investigate the role of air–water-coupling processes in tsunami generation and propagation. Here we use sea-level, atmospheric and satellite data from across the globe, along with numerical and analytical models, to demonstrate that this tsunami was driven by a constantly moving source in which the acoustic-gravity waves radiating from the eruption excite the ocean and transfer energy into it by means of resonance. A direct correlation between the tsunami and the acoustic-gravity waves’ arrival times confirms that these phenomena are closely linked. Our models also show that the unusually fast travel times and long duration of the tsunami, as well as its global reach, are consistent with an air–water-coupled source. This coupling mechanism has clear hazard implications, as it leads to higher waves along land masses that rise abruptly from long stretches of deep ocean waters."

Ferroptosis, a newly discovered type of programmed cell death, has been reported to alleviate renal tubular injury in ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (I/R-AKI). Entacapone is a specific inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, which is used as an adjuvant drug against Parkinson's disease. We demonstrated that entacapone prevents renal I/R injury by inhibiting ferroptosis. Compared with a sham group, entacapone treatment mitigated I/R-induced pathological alterations, improved renal function, and inhibited ferroptosis. In HK-2 cells, entacapone treatment significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation induced by the ferroptosis inducers erastin and RSL3, and significantly regulated expression of ferroptosis-related proteins. Entacapone upregulates p62 expression and affects the p62-KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, thereby upregulating nuclear translocation of NRF2. This action results in increased expression of the downstream SLC7A11, and significant suppression of oxidative stress and ferroptosis. Our results identify entacapone as a ferroptosis inhibitor that enhances antioxidant capacity. Entacapone may serve as a novel strategy to improve treatment of, and recovery from, I/R-AKI."
https://openalex.org/W4282588271,"Introduction Increased systemic oxidative stress is common in schizophrenia (SZ) patients. NADPH-oxidase 4 (NOX4) is the cell oxidoreductase, catalyzing the hydrogen peroxide formation. Presumably, NOX4 is the main oxidative stress factor in a number of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. We hypothesized that NOX4 may be involved in the oxidative stress development caused by the disease in the schizophrenic patients’ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Materials and methods The SZ group included 100 patients (68 men and 32 women aged 28 ± 11 years). The control group included 60 volunteers (35 men and 25 women aged 25 ± 12 years). Flow cytometry analysis (FCA) was used for DNA damage markers (8-oxodG, ɣH2AX), pro- and antiapoptotic proteins (BAX1 and BCL2) and the master-regulator of anti-oxidant response NRF2 detection in the lymphocytes of the untreated SZ patients (N = 100) and the healthy control (HC, N = 60). FCA and RT-qPCR were used for NOX4 and RNA NOX4 detection in the lymphocytes. RT-qPCR was used for mtDNA quantitation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cell-free DNA concentration was determined in blood plasma fluorimetrically. Results 8-oxodG, NOX4, and BCL2 levels in the PBL in the SZ group were higher than those in the HC group (p &lt; 0.001). ɣH2AX protein level was increased in the subgroup with high 8-oxodG (p&lt;0.02) levels and decreased in the subgroup with low 8-oxodG (p &lt;0.0001) levels. A positive correlation was found between 8-oxodG, ɣH2AX and BAX1 levels in the SZ group (p &lt;10 −6 ). NOX4 level in lymphocytes did not depend on the DNA damage markers values and BAX1 and BCL2 proteins levels. In 15% of PBL of the HC group a small cellular subfraction was found (5–12% of the total lymphocyte pool) with high DNA damage level and elevated BAX1 protein level. The number of such cells was maximal in PBL samples with low NOX4 protein levels. Conclusion Significant NOX4 gene expression was found a in SZ patients’ lymphocytes, but the corresponding protein is probably not a cause of the DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W4281967672,"High levels of redox enzymes have been commonly observed in various types of human cancer, although whether and how the enzymes contribute to cancer malignancy and therapeutic resistance have yet to be understood. Peroxiredoxin IV (Prx4) is an antioxidant with bona fide peroxidase and molecular chaperone functions. Here, we report that Prx4 is highly expressed in prostate cancer patient specimens, as well as established prostate cancer cell lines, and that its levels can be further stimulated through the activation of androgen receptor signaling. We used lentivirus-mediated shRNA knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9 based KO techniques to establish Prx4-depleted prostate cancer cells, which showed delayed cell cycle progression, reduced rate of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion compared to control cells. In addition, we used proteome profiler phosphokinase arrays to identify signaling changes in Prx4-depleted cells; we found that loss of Prx4 results in insufficient phosphorylation of both Akt and its downstream kinase GSK3α/β. Moreover, we demonstrate that Prx4-depleted cells are more sensitive to ionizing radiation as they display compromised ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species and increased accumulation of DNA damage. In mouse xenograft models, we show depletion of Prx4 leads to significant suppression of tumor growth, and tumors formed by Prx4-depleted cells respond more effectively to radiation therapy. Our findings suggest that increased levels of Prx4 contribute to the malignancy and radioresistance of prostate cancer through the activation of Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways. Therefore, strategies targeting Prx4 may be utilized to potentially inhibit tumor growth and overcome radioresistance in prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer is the most prevalent diagnosed cancer in men, and patients with localized prostate cancer are often treated with radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or the combination of both (1Siegel R.L.

Nogueira L. Mariotto A.B. Rowland J.H. Yabroff K.R. Alfano C.M. et al.(2019) Cancer treatment and survivorship statistics.CA: Cancer J. Clin. 2019; 69: 363-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Even with the commonly accepted screening of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels for early diagnosis, prostate cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death in men (1Siegel R.L.

The diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review.JAMA. 2017; 317: 2532-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). For advanced disease, androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy, bone-directed therapy (such as zoledronic acid or denosumab), radiation, or the combination of these treatments may be used (2Miller K.D. Nogueira L. Mariotto A.B. Rowland J.H. Yabroff K.R. Alfano C.M. et al.(2019) Cancer treatment and survivorship statistics.CA: Cancer J. Clin. 2019; 69: 363-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar). Radiation, either alone or combined with other therapies, is still the most common strategy to treat both localized and advanced prostate cancer. However, half of the patients who have been treated with salvage radiation will eventually suffer from disease progression, particularly those with aggressive features when it was first diagnosed (5Lee S.Y. Jeong E.K. Ju M.K. Jeon H.M. Kim M.Y. Kim C.H. et al.Induction of metastasis, cancer stem cell phenotype, and oncogenic metabolism in cancer cells by ionizing radiation.Mol.

Radiotherapy directly causes DNA damages and cell death through massive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6Steele E.M. Holmes J.A.

However, radiation also inevitably causes damages to surrounding normal tissue as side effects even with modulated doses (7Wallis C.J.D. Glaser A. Hu J.C. Huland H. Lawrentschuk N.

Therefore, identifying an effective strategy to sensitize prostate cancer to radiotherapy will improve the efficacy of current therapies and reduce radiation-associated side effects. Peroxiredoxin (Prx) is a family of highly conserved peroxidases that scavenge hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as well as contribute to ROS signaling under physiological conditions (8Rhee S.G. Overview on peroxiredoxin.Mol. Cell. 2016; 39: 1-5Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Prx can maintain local redox homeostasis and regulate ROS signaling pathway, which involves the oxidation of various downstream target proteins. Mammalian cells express six members of Prx (from Prx1 to Prx6), which can be divided into three subgroups (2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys, and 1-Cys Prx) based on the presence/absence and the location of the resolving cysteine (CR) (8Rhee S.G. Overview on peroxiredoxin.Mol. Cell. 2016; 39: 1-5Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 9Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Peroxiredoxins: a historical overview and speculative preview of novel mechanisms and emerging concepts in cell signaling.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). The 2-Cys Prxs reacts with H2O2 through its peroxidatic Cys (CP), leading to the formation of disulfide bonds with the spatially adjacent CR to establish head–tail type of homodimers or heterodimers. If the level of H2O2 accumulates, both CR and Cp can be overoxidized to sulfinic (-SO2) and/or sulfonic (-SO3) forms (8Rhee S.G. Overview on peroxiredoxin.Mol. Cell. 2016; 39: 1-5Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The overoxidized Prxs can multimerize into a ring structure with high molecular weight, which functions as protein chaperone to facilitate protein folding and prevent protein aggregation (10Hampton M.B. Vick K.A. Skoko J.J. Neumann C.A. Peroxiredoxin involvement in the initiation and progression of human cancer.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2018; 28: 591-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Among the family of Prxs, Prx4 is the only one located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the level of ROS is believed to be the highest among all subcellular organelles (8Rhee S.G. Overview on peroxiredoxin.Mol. Cell. 2016; 39: 1-5Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 11Sies H. Jones D.P. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) as pleiotropic physiological signalling agents.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The imbalance of ER redox homeostasis will cause ER stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response (11Sies H. Jones D.P. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) as pleiotropic physiological signalling agents.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that Prx4 is upregulated in different types of human cancer, including glioma (12Kim T.H. Song J. Alcantara Llaguno S.R. Murnan E. Liyanarachchi S.

In the context of carcinogenesis, Prx4 promoted urethane-induced lung cancer through the increased phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and c-Jun in transgenic mouse model study (19Zheng J. Guo X. Nakamura Y. Zhou X. Yamaguchi R. Zhang J. et al.Overexpression of PRDX4 modulates tumor microenvironment and promotes urethane-induced lung tumorigenesis.Oxidative Med. Cell Longev. 2020; 20208262730Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In prostate cancer, the most common metastatic site is the bone, which is often the only clinically detectable site of metastasis (20Logothetis C.J. Lin S.-H. Osteoblasts in prostate cancer metastasis to bone.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and depletion of Prx4 in prostate cancer cells can reduce the number of osteolytic lesions by inhibiting the differentiation of osteoclast (21Rafiei S. Tiedemann K. Tabariès S. Siegel P.M. Komarova S.V. Peroxiredoxin 4: a novel secreted mediator of cancer induced osteoclastogenesis.Cancer Lett. 2015; 361: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of how Prx4 contributes to prostate cancer malignancy is still not completely understood. In this study, our goal is to evaluate the expression of Prx4 in human prostate cancer and to study whether and how Prx4 contributes to prostate cancer development and therapeutic resistance. We examined the expression levels of Prx4 in multiple prostate cell lines as well as patient normal and tumor specimens. Cell lines with or without the expression of Prx4 were established, and phenotypic changes associated with the presence or absence of Prx4 were studied, and findings from cell culture were further confirmed in mouse models. In addition, molecular mechanisms by which Prx4 contributes to cancer malignancy and radioresistance were determined through series of biochemical analysis. Our data demonstrate that Prx4 plays a critical role in prostate cancer development and can be used as a potential target to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients. Prx4 is encoded by the gene PRDX4 on chromosome X in mammals. To study the functional significance of Prx4 in the pathogenesis of human cancer, meta-analysis was used to examine PRDX4 gene alterations in cancer patients. When PRDX4 was input as the query gene in all curated set of nonredundant studies in cBioPortal database (currently containing 150,839 samples from 145,223 patients), we found that prostate cancer has the highest rate of gene alterations among all cancer types. In particular, the alteration is predominantly characterized as gene amplification in all prostate cancer cases collected from five different cohorts of prostate cancer studies (Fig. 1A). In this analysis, gene amplification means an increased copy number of the gene in its original foci. For example, 10 out of 61 samples have PRDX4 gene amplification in metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma study reported from Arul Chinnaiyan's and Scott Tomlins' labs at the University of Michigan (22Grasso C.S. Wu Y.-M. Robinson D.R. Cao X. Dhanasekaran S.M. Khan A.P. et al.The mutational landscape of lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar), 20 out of 154 samples are amplified in prostate adenocarcinoma study reported from Fred Hutchinson cancer center (23Kumar A. Coleman I. Morrissey C. Zhang X. True L.D. Gulati R. et al.Substantial interindividual and limited intraindividual genomic diversity among tumors from men with metastatic prostate cancer.Nat. Med. 2016; 22: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), 48 out of 444 samples in metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma study reported by the SU2C/PCF Dream Team (24Abida W. Cyrta J. Heller G. Prandi D. Armenia J. Coleman I. et al.Genomic correlates of clinical outcome in advanced prostate cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 11428-11436Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), and 10 out of 150 samples in metastatic prostate cancer reported by the same team (25Robinson D. Van Allen E.M. Eliezer M. Wu Y.-M. al e. Chinnaiyan Arul M. Integrative clinical genomics of advanced prostate cancer.Cell. 2015; 161: 1215-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). In contrast to the high rate of amplification, mutations of PRDX4 gene are very rare in prostate cancer but can be found in tumors of other tissues/organs. In the current cBioPortal database, there are 91 mutations in PRDX4 gene identified, including 73 missense mutations at nonoverlapping site, six nonsense mutations, 11 mutations that may affect splicing, and one that may create a new fusion mutant. It appears that these mutations occurred randomly at extremely low frequency since no hotspot mutations were identified (Fig. S1A). Moreover, a close examination of these mutation sites reveals that none of these mutations is predicted to affect Prx4 enzymatic activity based on previously published structural studies (26Cao Z. Tavender T.J. Roszak A.W. Cogdell R.J. Bulleid N.J. Crystal structure of reduced and of oxidized peroxiredoxin IV enzyme reveals a stable oxidized decamer and a non-disulfide-bonded intermediate in the catalytic cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42257-42266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We also examined PRDX4 copy number variations and found significant increase in the numbers of gain and amplification (Fig. S1B). In addition, methylation levels of PRDX4 gene promoter in various cancers and normal tissues were compared, and we found that it is significantly decreased in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate (Fig. S1C). In consistence, transcript levels of Prx4 are significantly increased in a variety of human tumors including prostate cancer compared with their levels in normal tissues (Fig. S1D). When prostate cancer patient samples at different stages were compared, the levels of PRDX4 transcripts in tumors are all significantly higher than normal but there is no further increase as the cancer progresses (Fig. 1B). However, when transcript levels of PRDX4 were compared between patients with or without androgen receptor (AR) amplification, there is a significant increase in samples with AR amplification (Fig. 1C), indicating that PRDX4 may be activated by AR signaling. Furthermore, compared with those without, patients with PRDX4 gene amplification has significantly shortened disease-free survival (Fig. 1D) and significantly reduced probability of overall survival (Fig. 1E). In order to identify an antibody that only recognizes Prx4, we obtained several commercially available anti-Prx4 antibodies and tested their potency and specificity using immunoblotting to detect endogenous Prx4 in various tissue/cell lysates from WT mice, Prx4 KO mice, or established human cell cultures. One antibody that specifically recognizes mouse or human Prx4 while has no cross-reaction with other proteins was obtained and used in this study. For example, Western blotting results indicated that this antibody recognizes both normal version of Prx4 in total lysates of various mouse organs and a spliced variant of Prx4 with higher molecular weight that only existed in the testis (27Fujii J. Ikeda Y. Kurahashi T. Homma T. Physiological and pathological views of peroxiredoxin 4.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 83: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Homma T. Kurahashi T. Ishii N. Shirasawa N. Fujii J. Testis-specific peroxiredoxin 4 variant is not absolutely required for spermatogenesis and fertility in mice.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2A). The specificity of this antibody is also confirmed in lysates from mice with whole body KO of Prx4 since anti-Prx4 band is completely lost in Western blot except the testis-specific Prx4 as previously reported (28Homma T. Kurahashi T. Ishii N. Shirasawa N. Fujii J. Testis-specific peroxiredoxin 4 variant is not absolutely required for spermatogenesis and fertility in mice.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2B). The specificity of this antibody to recognize human Prx4 was also further validated and authenticated by the presence/absence of only one band in the following studies by comparing its expression in control and Prx4 knockdown or KO cell lines. To verify bioinformatic analysis results and to study the role of Prx4 in prostate cancer development, firstly we examined the levels of Prx4 protein in human prostate normal and cancer tissues by immunostaining using commercial tissue microarray slides. Samples include human prostate normal (n = 50) and adenocarcinoma (n = 66). As scored by the pathologist, we found that there is a significantly increased staining of Prx4 overall score in prostate adenocarcinoma compared with normal prostate. When further grouped by Gleason grade, there is no significantly increased score of Prx4 staining between different groups (Fig. 2C). Next, we examined the protein levels of Prx4 in various human prostate nontumorigenic or tumor cell lines. Cell lysates from a panel of prostate-derived cell lines including nontumorigenic (RWPE1), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH1), AR-positive adenocarcinoma (LNCaP, C4-2, and 22Rv1), and AR-negative adenocarcinoma (PC3 and DU145) were subjected to Western blotting. In all these cells, there is only band of anti-Prx4 detected with molecular weight around 27 KDa, which rules out the possibility of testis-specific Prx4 in these cells (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the levels of Prx4 in cell lines established from prostate tumors are significantly higher than those of the nontumorigenic RWPE1 cells (Fig. 2D bar graph). Taken together, these data suggest that the levels of Prx4 are highly expressed in patient specimens of prostate cancer and prostate tumor–derived cell lines. Interestingly, the levels of Prx4 in AR-positive cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, and 22Rv1) show a trend of being higher than in cell lines without detectable levels of AR expression (Fig. 2D), raising the possibility that Prx4 may be positively regulated by the activation of AR signaling. To test this possibility, the PROMO platform was used to determine whether there are conserved androgen response elements (a 15 bp palindromic sequence containing two hexameric 5′-AGAACA-3′ half sites arranged as an inverted repeat with a 3 bp spacer) within the PRDX4 gene promoter region (29Lonergan P.E. Tindall D.J. Androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer development and progression.J. Carcinog. 2011; 10: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 30Tan M.H.E. Li J. Xu H.E. Melcher K. Yong E.-l. Androgen receptor: structure, role in prostate cancer and drug discovery.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2015; 36: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). From transcription start site of PRDX4 to the upstream promoter of 5.1 Kbps, a total of seven putative AR-binding sites were identified (Table S1). To test whether these elements are involved in the regulation of Prx4 expression, cells were treated with R1881, a synthetic hormone that is known to bind AR leading to its translocation into the nucleus to bind and activate androgen response element–containing promoters. We found that treatment of LNCaP cells with R188 led to a robust, dose-dependent increased expression of Prx4, along with similar effect on the expression of PSA in these cells as expected (Fig. 3A). However, treatment of C4-2 or 22Rv1 failed to activate either the expression of Prx4 or PSA (Fig. 3A), for which reasons are unknown. To further validate that Prx4 is activated by AR signaling in LNCaP cells, mouse xenografts through subcutaneous injection of LNCaP cells were generated. After tumor reached 100 mm3, mice were separated into two groups receiving either sham surgery or castration, and tumor growth was monitored for 2 weeks before euthanasia. In consistence with similar studies from literature (31Li Q. Deng Q. Chao H.-P. Liu X. Lu Y. Lin K. et al.Linking prostate cancer cell AR heterogeneity to distinct castration and enzalutamide responses.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Corey E. Quinn J.E. Buhler K.R. Nelson P.S. Macoska J.A. True L.D. et al.LuCaP 35: a new model of prostate cancer progression to androgen independence.Prostate. 2003; 55: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we found that castration led to significantly reduced rate of tumor growth as indicated by the comparison of tumor growth curve (Fig. 3B) and final tumor weight (Fig. 3C). Lysates from tumors were subjected to Western blotting to determine the levels of Prx4, PSA, AR, and β-actin, and we found that tumors from castrated mice have much lower PSA and Prx4 levels compared to tumors from control mice (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that sustained activation of AR signaling is required to maintain the high levels of Prx4 expression in LNCaP xenografts and to support its continued growth in mice. To study the function of Prx4 in prostate cancer, lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO techniques were used to generate cell lines that are depleted of endogenous Prx4. In both LNCaP and DU145 cell lines, compared with control cells expressing nontarget shRNA (shNT), stable expression of shRNA targeting the coding region of Prx4 (shPrx4) leads to the complete loss of endogenous Prx4 protein expression, whereas other proteins’ expression such as Prx1 remains unaffected (Fig. 4A). The targeting specificity of shPrx4 has been described in previous study in our lab (14Wei Q. Jiang H. Xiao Z. Baker A. Young M.R. Veenstra T.D. et al.Sulfiredoxin–peroxiredoxin IV axis promotes human lung cancer progression through modulation of specific phosphokinase signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 7004-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To establish Prx4 KO cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technique, we designed two separate guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the PRDX4 gene and their efficiency to KO endogenous Prx4 was compared as shown in the supplementary data (Fig. S3A). We found that gRNA1 had a higher KO efficiency than that of gRNA2. Therefore, gRNA1 was used to generate KO cells from both LNCaP and DU145 cell lines, and cells including LNCaP-Prx4KO8 and DU145-Prx4KO3 with complete loss of Prx4 were established and used in all following experiments (Fig. S3B). In addition to Western blotting, immunostaining was used to further confirm that loss of Prx4 expression is true at individual cell level in both knock out cell lines (Fig. S3C). These data also confirm that anti-Prx4 antibody specifically recognizes Prx4. In both LNCaP and DU145 cell lines, KO of Prx4 does not affect the expression of other Prxs such as Prx1 (Fig. 4B). To study the effect of Prx4 depletion on cell growth and proliferation, firstly we used flow cytometry to evaluate the impact of depleting Prx4 on cell cycle progression. Cells were synchronized by serum starvation and cell cycle progression was reinitiated by the stimulation with serum containing medium. As shown in Figure 4C, there is a significantly greater number of Prx4-depleted LNCaP cells retained in the G0/G1-phase of cell cycle, while much fewer of these cells progressed into the S-phase. Similar results of fewer cells in S-phase were observed in Prx4 KO cells established from DU145 cell line (Fig. 4D). In both cell lines, the rate of cell proliferation as indicated by the calculation of doubling time in Prx4 KO cells is significantly reduced compared to those of control cells (Fig. 4E). Therefore, these data suggest that depletion of Prx4 in prostate cancer cells delays cell cycle progression and leads to the reduced rate of cell proliferation under adherent conditions. To examine whether loss of Prx4 causes other phenotypic changes in prostate cancer cells, assays for cell migration and invasion were performed. To evaluate cell migration, wound-healing assays and cell movement tracking analysis were performed. Wounds in cultured cells were created by scratching. We found that KO of Prx4 in either LNCaP or DU145 cell lines leads to similar results of delayed closure of the wounded gap (Fig. 4F), indicating that Prx4 KO cells are less migrative than control cells. However, the interpretation of this result may be affected by the difference on the rate of cell proliferation. To solve this concern, time-lapse images of cells in culture were obtained and videos were generated. As shown in the video of cultured LNCaP cells as an example, control cells are highly migrative and constantly moving around, whereas Prx4 KO cells are much less active in movement (supplementary video v1 and v2). To quantify moving speed and distance, cell movement tracking analysis was performed using CellTracker software (http://www.celltracker.website/index.html) as previously reported (33Piccinini F. Kiss A. Horvath P. CellTracker (not only) for dummies.Bioinformatics. 2016; 32: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In both cell lines, we found that KO of Prx4 leads to significant decrease of moving velocity and distance (Fig. 4, G and H). Therefore, these data indicate that loss of Prx4 inhibits cell migration and movement. To study the effect of Prx4 loss on cell invasiveness, Matrigel invasion assays were performed, with equal number of control or Prx4 KO cells being seeded into invasion chambers. Cells invaded through Matrigel were stained and counted. We found that significantly low number of Prx4 KO cells were able to invade through Matrigel in both LNCaP and DU145 cell lines (Fig. 4I), indicating that Prx4 KO cells are less invasive. Taken together, these data sugges"

To date, no studies have been conducted on the practice of self-medication among the indigenous population living in Chittagong Hill Tract (CHT).This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of self-medication and analyzing the factors associated with it among the indigenous population in CHT.This cross-sectional study was conducted from late October to early December 2020; among different indigenous group populations residing in the three districts of CHT aged 18 or more. A pre-tested and semi-structured questionnaire was developed to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, health status, frequency of self-medication, reasons for self-medication in last one year, as well as other variables. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess associated factors with self-medication.A total of 1350 people from different indigenous populations were interviewed, among whom 49.9% practiced self-medication. The rate of self-prescribed antibiotics usage (80.9%) was significantly higher compared to other drugs. Self-prescribed medications were mostly used for diarrhea and food poisoning (60.6%), cough, cold and fever (51.4%), and headache (51.4%). A common source of self-prescribed medicines was community or retail pharmacy and the most reported reason for self-prescribed medication was the long-distance of healthcare facilities from home.The prevalence of self-medication is substantially high among indigenous people and the effect is alarming. Particular concern is the misuse of antibiotics and analgesic drugs. Increasing awareness among the population of the negative effect of self-medication and implementation of proper policies and actions are urgently needed to prevent self-medication among indigenous population in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4281662082,"Prokaryotes evolved clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins as a kind of adaptive immune defense against mobile genetic elements including harmful phages. To counteract this defense, many mobile genetic elements in turn encode anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) to inactivate the CRISPR-Cas system. While multiple mechanisms of Acrs have been uncovered, it remains unknown whether other mechanisms are utilized by uncharacterized Acrs. Here, we report a novel mechanism adopted by recently identified AcrIF23. We show that AcrIF23 interacts with the Cas2/3 helicase-nuclease in the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system, similar to AcrIF3. The structure of AcrIF23 demonstrated a novel fold and structure-based mutagenesis identified a surface region of AcrIF23 involved in both Cas2/3-binding and its inhibition capacity. Unlike AcrIF3, however, we found AcrIF23 only potently inhibits the DNA cleavage activity of Cas2/3 but does not hinder the recruitment of Cas2/3 to the CRISPR RNA-guided surveillance complex (the Csy complex). Also, in contrast to AcrIF3 which hinders substrate DNA recognition by Cas2/3, we show AcrIF23 promotes DNA binding to Cas2/3.

Taken together, our study identifies a novel anti-CRISPR mechanism used by AcrIF23 and highlights the diverse mechanisms adopted by Acrs. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins constitute thus far the only discovered prokaryotic adaptive immune system against the invasion of potentially harmful mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as bacteriophages (1Barrangou R. Fremaux C. Deveau H. Richards M. Boyaval P. Moineau S. et al.CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes.Science. 2007; 315: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (4140) Google Scholar). The CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread among prokaryotes, distributed in about 40% bacterial and 85% archaeal phyla (2Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Iranzo J. Shmakov S.A. Alkhnbashi O.S. Brouns S.J.J. et al.Evolutionary classification of CRISPR-Cas systems: a burst of class 2 and derived variants.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Based on working by multisubunit surveillance complex or a single multidomain Cas effector, CRISPR-Cas systems are primarily classified into class 1 and class 2, which are further divided into six types (I-VI) and 33 subtypes based upon their specific Cas protein components (2Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Iranzo J. Shmakov S.A. Alkhnbashi O.S. Brouns S.J.J. et al.Evolutionary classification of CRISPR-Cas systems: a burst of class 2 and derived variants.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 18: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The immunity strategies of CRISPR-Cas systems of different types are approximately convergent. First, the nucleic acids of the invasive MGEs are recognized, processed, and integrated into the CRISPR arrays as spacers in the prokaryotic genome. Next, the precursor CRISPR RNA (crRNA) containing CRISPR arrays was transcribed and further processed within the repeats region to generate mature crRNAs composed of both repeat and spacer segments. Last, the nucleic acids of the invading MGEs were recognized through protospacer adjacent motifs in their nucleic acids and cleaved by crRNA-guided Cas effector. Overall, all these steps could be summarized into three working stages: adaptation, crRNA maturation, and interference (3Hille F. Richter H. Wong S.P. Bratovic M. Ressel S. Charpentier E. The biology of CRISPR-Cas: backward and forward.Cell. 2018; 172: 1239-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The subtype I-F (also named as I-F1 in the latest classification) CRISPR-Cas system, belonging to the most widely distributed type I system, is composed of Cas1, Cas2-3 fusion protein, Cas8f (Csy1), Cas5f (Csy2), Cas7f (Csy3), and Cas6f (Csy4) as protein components (2Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Iranzo J. Shmakov S.A. Alkhnbashi O.S. Brouns S.J.J. et al.Evolutionary classification of CRISPR-Cas systems: a burst of class 2 and derived variants.Nat. Rev.

Koonin E.V. Unification of Cas protein families and a simple scenario for the origin and evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems.Biol. Direct. 2011; 6: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In the type I-F system, the crRNA-guided surveillance complex (or the Csy complex) is generated through the assembly of one Cas5f, one Cas6f, six Cas7f subunits, and one Cas8f around the central crRNA backbone. The Csy complex recognizes, unwinds, and hybridizes with the target double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), resulting in conformational changes of both the Csy complex and dsDNA, which is further in favor of the recruitment of the Cas2/3 protein to degrade the target DNA to accomplish the immunity. However, MGEs have developed counter-adaptations, such as anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins, to fight against the CRISPR-Cas system and survive from this immune system. In 2013, five distinct ‘anti-CRISPR’ genes, i.e., acrIF1-5, inhibiting type I-F CRISPR system were first found in the genomes of bacteriophages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6Bondy-Denomy J. Pawluk A. Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Bacteriophage genes that inactivate the CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system.Nature. 2013; 493: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Until now, about 90 families of Acr proteins have already been experimentally verified to counteract 12 CRISPR-Cas subtypes (7Huang L. Yang B. Yi H. Asif A. Wang J. Lithgow T. et al.AcrDB: a database of anti-CRISPR operons in prokaryotes and viruses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49: D622-D629Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Presently, working strategies of all characterized Acr proteins could be summarized as four major types: interference of target DNA/RNA recognition, inhibition of target DNA/RNA cleavage, prevention of assembly of the surveillance complex (only for Class 2), and degradation of cyclic oligoadenylates for signal transduction (only for type III) (8Jia N. Patel D.J. Structure-based functional mechanisms and biotechnology applications of anti-CRISPR proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2021; 22: 563-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Notably, most Acr proteins have been characterized to achieve its inhibition through a stable interaction with corresponding Cas components (9Wiegand T. Karambelkar S. Bondy-Denomy J. Wiedenheft B. Structures and strategies of anti-CRISPR-mediated immune suppression.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2020; 74: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For Acr proteins against subtype I-F CRISPR-Cas system, 24 families have been described until now (6Bondy-Denomy J. Pawluk A. Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R.

Out of these, interestingly, other than sterically inhibiting the binding between the Csy complex and target DNA, AcrIF9, and AcrIF14 have also been found to mislead the Csy complex to absorb nonsequence–specific DNA, which has been demonstrated to contribute to the inhibition activity of the Acr proteins (18Hirschi M.

Distinct from the above ten Acr proteins, AcrIF11 does not stably bind the Csy complex, instead, it has been reported to possess ADP-ribosylation activity on the N250 residue of the Cas8f subunit of the Csy complex, a key residue required for protospacer adjacent motif recognition (24Niu Y.

Elucidation of the inhibition mechanisms of uncharacterized Acr proteins can not only facilitate the development of new “brake” tools for CRISPR-Cas–based genome editing but also provide the weakness points of the CRISPR-Cas systems. Here, we determined the crystal structure of AcrIF23 and further elucidated its working mechanism through biochemical and mutagenesis assays. AcrIF23 interacts with the Cas2/3 protein but not the Csy complex, as AcrIF3 does. However, unlike AcrIF3, which binds Cas2/3 and prevents its recruitment by the Csy–target DNA complex, AcrIF23 binds Cas2/3 to inhibit its nuclease activity but does not hinder its recruitment. Further biochemical and mutagenesis analyses uncovered the key residues involved in AcrIF23-Cas2/3 binding, as well as the inhibition capacity of AcrIF23. In conclusion, our study reveals another Cas2/3-interacting AcrIF protein and a novel inhibition mechanism of solely inactivating the Cas2/3 nuclease. In all, this work provides new insights into the highly diverse mechanisms adopted by Acr proteins. First, we tested the inhibition ability of AcrIF23 against the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system through an in vitro dsDNA cleavage assay. As indicated in Figure 1A, while target dsDNA was only slightly cleaved by the Cas2/3 alone, this cleavage was remarkably enhanced through a previous incubation of the Csy complex and target dsDNA (lanes 1–3, Fig. 1A). Consistent with the results of the in vivo assay (10Pinilla-Redondo R. Shehreen S. Marino N.D. Fagerlund R.D. Brown C.M. Sorensen S.J. et al.Discovery of multiple anti-CRISPRs highlights anti-defense gene clustering in mobile genetic elements.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), AcrIF23 could inhibit the cleavage of target DNA by the Csy complex and Cas2/3 (lanes 4–6, Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the inhibition was not affected whether AcrIF23 was added before or after the incubation of Csy and target dsDNA (lanes 4–9, Fig. 1A), suggesting that AcrIF23 may function after the hybridization between the Csy complex and target dsDNA. To further verify the interference stage of AcrIF23, we conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). As expected, an obvious super-shift of the band of the target dsDNA was observed with the addition of the Csy complex (lanes 1 and 2, Fig. 1B), suggesting their interaction. As we hypothesized based on the results of the DNA cleavage assay (Fig. 1A), addition of AcrIF23 did not influence the hybridization between the Csy complex and target DNA regardless of the incubation order (lanes 3–8, Fig. 1B). Taken together, AcrIF23 achieves its inhibition after the binding between the Csy complex and target DNA. Next, we moved on to investigate the detailed inhibitory mechanism of AcrIF23. First, we tested whether AcrIF23 interacts with the Csy complex or the Cas2/3 protein like most characterized type I-F Acr proteins do. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay showed that while AcrIF1 exhibited a stable interaction with the Csy complex (binding KD of 0.42 μM), no obvious interaction was observed between AcrIF23 and the Csy complex (Fig. 2A). However, interaction between AcrIF23 and Cas2/3 was clearly observed with a binding KD calculated to be 1.2 μM by MST and 3.36 μM by surface plasmon resonance assay (Fig. 2, B and C). AcrIF3 was used as a positive control with a binding KD of 31 nM toward Cas2-3 by MST assay (Fig. 2B). In conclusion, AcrIF23 interacts with the Cas2/3 protein but not the Csy complex to fulfil its inhibition. To further elucidate the working mechanism of AcrIF23, we solved its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.13 Å (Fig. 3A and Table 1) using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The Rfree factor (0.2338) is a little high for the structure, which might be caused by some less well defined residues near the N terminus. The asymmetric unit contains only one AcrIF23 molecule; however, it forms a stable dimer with its symmetry-related molecule by swapping their N terminus (residues 1–18) with a buried surface area of 5869.6 Å2 (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, our size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering analysis showed that AcrIF23 is a monomer in solution (Fig. S1, 17.96 kDa monomer mass theoretically and 17.97 ± 1.40 kDa experimentally). This suggests that the dimeric assembly of AcrIF23 deduced from the crystal structure is a crystallographic artifact. Therefore, we hereafter describe the structure of the monomeric AcrIF23 form composed of the swapped N-terminal region (residues 1–17) of the symmetry-related AcrIF23 molecule and the C-terminal region (residues 20–159) of the AcrIF23 molecule in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 3C). AcrIF23 is almost exclusively composed of α helices, hereafter naming α1-α7. Typically, α1 is connected to α2 through a rather long loop (residues 11–54) with a short antiparallel two-stranded β sheet within it. Moreover, α6 (residues 114–137) and α7 (residues 140–157) are two long antiparallel α helices (Fig. 3C). Dali search revealed no entries with a sequence coverage over 50% of AcrIF23, suggesting that AcrIF23 adopts an overall novel fold (Table S1 and Fig. S2).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsStatisticsAcrIF23 (native, PDB: 7FIA)AcrIF23 (selenourea-soaked)Data collectionSpace groupP41212P41212Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)65.569, 65.569, 95.05365.986, 65.986, 96.424α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 90.0090.00, 90.00, 90.00Resolution (Å)50–2.13 (2.21–2.13)aFor each structure one crystal was used.,bValues in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.50–2.38 (2.47–2.38)Rsym or Rmerge (%)10.4 (70.2)13.0 (150.9)I/σ(I)34.8 (5.8)40.8 (2.6)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)99.9 (99.2)Redundancy24.6 (25.4)86.6 (35.4)RefinementResolution (Å)30.99–2.1346.66–2.38No. reflections12,1488915Rwork/RfreecRfree was calculated with 5% of the reflections selected.0.2042/0.23380.2193/0.2321No. atoms13751337 Protein12411235 Ligand/ion020 Water13482B factors28.7439.31 Protein28.3039.01 Ligand/ion57.93 Water32.7839.31R.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0030.007Bond angles (°)0.601.03Ramachandran plot (%)Favored98.1098.09Allowed1.901.91Outliers00MolProbity score1.381.43a For each structure one crystal was used.b Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.c Rfree was calculated with 5% of the reflections selected. Open table in a new tab Since AcrIF23 interacts with Cas2/3 but not the Csy complex, we speculated that the interaction between AcrIF23 and Cas2/3 might be essential for its inhibitory activity. First, we tested whether AcrIF23 could inhibit the activity of Cas2/3 alone. It has been reported that Cas2/3 alone could efficiently degrade single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and dsDNA with an inner bubble in the absence of the Csy complex (25Rollins M.F. Chowdhury S. Carter J. Golden S.M. Wilkinson R.A. Bondy-Denomy J. et al.Cas1 and the Csy complex are opposing regulators of Cas2/3 nuclease activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E5113-E5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hence, we performed an in vitro ssDNA cleavage assay with Cas2/3 and AcrIF23. The results showed that the DNA cleavage was markedly reduced with the addition of AcrIF23 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that AcrIF23 can inhibit the nuclease activity of Cas2/3. To determine the key AcrIF23 residues involved in its inhibition ability, we performed a structure-guided mutagenesis study through mutating the surface residues of AcrIF23 (Fig. 4B) and testing their inhibitory activities toward Cas2/3. Results of the in vitro ssDNA cleavage assays revealed that out of the 20 mutants we designed, three AcrIF23 mutants, i.e., Q17A/N18A/Q20A, L24A/E25A, and T26A/I28A exhibit markedly reduced inhibition of the ssDNA cleavage compared with wildtype AcrIF23 (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, further MST assay indicated that none of the three AcrIF23 mutants interact with Cas2/3 (Fig. 4E). Notably, the 20 mutants were expressed and purified well as WT AcrIF23 (Fig. S3). The mutations might decrease the binding between AcrIF23 and Cas2/3 to an affinity unable to be detected by the MST assay, at least for Q17A/N18A/Q20A, which mutant still retained weak inhibitory effect (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the mutagenesis study indicated that the interacting residues of AcrIF23 are all located at the surface loop region (residues 17–28) between α1 and α2, suggesting the important role of this surface in Cas2/3 binding (Fig. 4B). Notably, all these residues, except Q17 and Q20, are also highly conserved among AcrIF23 homologs (Fig. S4). That is, AcrIF23 interacts with Cas2/3 predominantly by a surface loop region, which is essential for the inhibitory ability of AcrIF23. Interestingly, AcrIF3 has also been identified to interact with Cas2/3 to inhibit the CRISPR-Cas system. Therefore, we moved on to investigate whether the inhibition mechanisms of these two Acrs are similar. First, we compared the inhibition activities of AcrIF23 and AcrIF3 on the cleavage of ssDNA by Cas2/3. The results showed that while addition of AcrIF3 moderately reduced the cleavage activity of Cas2/3 (lanes 3–5, Fig. 5A), AcrIF23 displays a much stronger inhibition of the cleavage activity (lanes 6–8, Fig. 5A). Next, we tested whether AcrIF23 can inhibit the Cas2/3 recruitment by the Csy complex as AcrIF3 does. As indicated in the EMSA in Figure 5B, the band of Csy-DNA complex shifted again with the addition of Cas2/3, indicating the formation of a ternary complex Csy-DNA-Cas2/3 (lanes 1–3), which could be markedly inhibited by the addition of AcrIF3 (lanes 4–6), as indicated in previous studies (19Bondy-Denomy J. Garcia B. Strum S. Du M.J. Rollins M.F. Hidalgo-Reyes Y. et al.Multiple mechanisms for CRISPR-Cas inhibition by anti-CRISPR proteins.Nature. 2015; 526: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Notably, AcrIF23 showed no obvious inhibition on this recruitment (lanes 7–9), suggesting that AcrIF23 differs from AcrIF3 in mechanism. Previous study of the structure of Cas2/3-AcrIF3 complex proposed that AcrIF3 can prevent the substrate recognition of Cas2/3 due to the blocking of DNA binding tunnel by AcrIF3 (21Wang X. Yao D. Xu J.G. Li A. Xu J. Fu P. et al.Structural basis of Cas3 inhibition by the bacteriophage protein AcrF3.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 868-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We confirmed this hypothesis through an EMSA experiment (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, under the same experimental conditions, AcrIF23 did not prevent substrate DNA binding but instead promote substrate DNA binding to Cas2/3, although AcrIF23 itself did not bind DNA under the AcrIF23 concentration used in the assay (Fig. 5C). Taken together, our results showed that AcrIF23 does not prevent substrate DNA binding or Cas2/3 recruitment by the Csy complex but promotes substrate DNA binding to Cas2/3. Acr proteins exhibit highly variable protein sequences and structures. Up to now, the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system still harbors the largest Acr family, totally 24 Acr proteins, in which 11 Acr proteins have been characterized structurally and mechanically. Among these 11 families, targeting the Csy complex is a much more prevalent inhibition strategy which is adopted by AcrIF1/2/4/6/7/8/9/10/11/14 (13Chowdhury S. Carter J. Rollins M.F. Golden S.M.

On the contrary, AcrIF23 is the second reported type I-F Acr protein (the other is AcrIF3) (19Bondy-Denomy J. Garcia B. Strum S. Du M.J. Rollins M.F. Hidalgo-Reyes Y. et al.Multiple mechanisms for CRISPR-Cas inhibition by anti-CRISPR proteins.Nature. 2015; 526: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and the third type I Acr protein (including AcrIE1) (26Pawluk A.

However, unlike AcrIF3 and AcrIE1, which have been proposed to inhibit the recruitment of Cas2/3 by the Cascade complex (26Pawluk A. Shah M. Mejdani M. Calmettes C. Moraes T.F.

The result that AcrIF23 does not inhibit substrate DNA binding but promotes DNA binding to Cas2/3 (Fig. 5C) suggests that AcrIF23 does not function as a competitive inhibitor but more like an uncompetitive inhibitor. However, the fact that AcrIF23 can bind the apo Cas2/3 enzyme also suggests that it is not a canonical uncompetitive inhibitor. Taken together, the present data suggest that AcrIF23 might not directly bind to and block the nuclease active site of Cas2/3, but to a different region and allosterically inhibit the enzymatic activity of Cas2/3. We propose that AcrIF23 might function as a mixed-type inhibitor and can bind both the enzyme and enzyme–substrate complex. Therefore, this also suggests a possibility of formation of a quaternary complex, i.e., Csy-DNA-Cas2/3-AcrIF23, which means that AcrIF23 might not only accomplish the inhibition through interference with the nuclease activity of Cas2/3 but also occupy the Csy complex through the formation of the invalid quaternary complex. Future structural studies into the AcrIF23-Cas2/3 and the potential AcrIF23-Cas2/3-DNA complexes will further provide insights into the inhibition mechanism of AcrIF23. As for the CRISPR-Cas stages hindered by Acrs, only AcrIF3 has been verified to function after target DNA binding by the Csy complex before our study. A recent study showed that the binding of AcrIF4 to the Csy complex does not affect target DNA hybridization (16Gabel C. Li Z. Zhang H. Chang L. Structural basis for inhibition of the type I-F CRISPR-Cas surveillance complex by AcrIF4, AcrIF7 and AcrIF14.Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may function after Csy-DNA hybridization. However, a previous in vivo assay suggested that AcrIF4 prevents the Csy complex to interact with its target DNA. Therefore, it still remains unknown how AcrIF4 exerts its inhibition capacity in vivo. In all, our studies uncover a novel inhibition mechanism of type I-F Acrs and provide new insights into the ongoing molecular arms race between viral parasites and the immune systems of their hosts. The full-length AcrIF3 and AcrIF23 genes from P. aeruginosa were synthesized by GenScript and cloned into pGEX-6p-1 to produce GST-tagged fusion proteins with a PreScission site.

https://openalex.org/W4282591223,"A tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) is a passive vibration control device that not only mitigates unwanted structural vibrations but also acts as a water storage facility in a building. These aspects of TLCD make its application specifically suited for building structures. Previously, many experimental works on TLCDs have been conducted considering a single degree of freedom (SDOF) structure. However, the performance of TLCDs to control the response of multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) structure has rarely been studied experimentally. Therefore, this study has investigated the performance of a tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) on a multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) structure using shake table testing. A four-storey steel frame structure equipped with TLCD at the top of the fourth storey has been studied. Experimental normalized frequency response curves for MDOF structure equipped with TLCD have been determined. For this purpose, a series of harmonic loadings including frequencies 0.65 Hz, 1.17 Hz, 1.30 Hz, 1.43 Hz and 1.95 Hz have been applied in addition to historic earthquake loading. Peak and root-mean-square (RMS) accelerations have been discussed in detail for all the applied loadings at each storey level of the structure. For comparison purposes, the percentage reductions in peak and RMS accelerations have been calculated and compared. Also, RMS displacements and inter-storey drifts have been presented for resonant and seismic excitations. Both in time and frequency domains, responses of controlled MDOF structure have been analyzed and compared with uncontrolled structure. Results confirmed that TLCD has improved the MDOF structure responses at harmonic loadings frequencies near resonance and historic earthquake excitations. Furthermore, the improvement in the responses of MDOF structure with TLCD is more prominent at harmonic loadings compared to historic earthquake loading."

However, the chemical substance produced by BS-Z15 for resistance to VD-991 remains elusive. Here, a serial purification methods including HCl precipitation, organic solvent extraction, and separation by semi-preparative High-Performance Liquid Chromatography were performed to obtain a single compound about 3.5 mg/L from the fermentation broth of BS-Z15, which has an antifungal activity against VD-991. Moreover, Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and Tandem Mass Spectrometry analyses were carried out to finally confirm that the active compound from BS-Z15 is a mycosubtilin homologue with C17 fatty acid chain. Genomic sequence prediction and PCR verification further showed that the BS-Z15 genome contains the whole mycosubtilin operon comprising four ORFs: fenF, mycA, mycB, and mycC, and the expression levels of mycA-N, mycB-Y and mycC-N reached a peak at 32-h fermentation. Although mycosubtilin homologue at 1 μg/mL promoted the germination of cotton seed, that with high concentration at 10 μg/mL had no significant effect on seed germination, plant height and dry weight. Furthermore, mycosubtilin homologue sprayed at 10 μg/mL on two-week-old cotton leaves promotes the expression of pathogen-associated genes and gossypol accumulation, and greatly decreases VD-991 infection in cotton with disease index statistics. This study provides an efficient purification strategy for mycosubtilin homologue from BS-Z15, which can potentially be used as a biocontrol agent for controlling verticillium wilt in cotton."

Eighteen biometric characters, four morphological indices and eleven qualitative physical traits were investigated in a total of 569 adult birds (158 males and 411 females). Descriptive statistics, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test followed by the Mann-Whitney U and Dunn-Bonferroni tests for post hoc, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Univariate Analysis, Canonical Discriminant Analysis, Categorical Principal Component Analysis and Decision Trees were employed to discern the effects of agro-ecological zone and sex on the morphostructural parameters. Agro-ecology had significant effect (P<0.05; P<0.01) on all the colour traits. In general, the most frequently observed colour phenotype of Guinea fowl had pearl plumage colour (54.0%), pale red skin colour (94.2%), black shank colour (68.7%), brown eye colour (49.7%), white earlobe colour (54.8%) and brown helmet colour (72.6%). The frequencies of helmet shape and wattle size were significantly influenced (P<0.01) by agro-ecology and sex. Overall, birds from the Southern Guinea Savanna zone had significantly higher values (P<0.05) for most biometric traits compared to their Sudano-Sahelian and Tropical Rainforest counterparts. They were also more compact (120.00 vs. 110.00 vs. 107.69) but had lesser condition index (7.66 vs. 9.45 vs. 9.30) and lower long-leggedness (19.71 vs. 19.23 vs. 9.51) than their counterparts from the two other zones. Sexual dimorphism (P<0.05) was in favour of male birds especially those in Southern Guinea Savanna and Sudano-Sahelian zones. However, the MCA and discriminant analysis revealed considerable intermingling of the qualitative physical traits, biometric traits and body indices especially between the Sudano-Sahelian and Tropical Rainforest birds. In spite of the high level of genetic admixture, the Guinea fowl populations could to a relative extent be distinguished using wing length, body length and eye colour. Generally, the birds from the three zones appeared to be more homogeneous than heterogeneous in nature. However, further complementary work on genomics will guide future selection and breeding programs geared towards improving the productivity, survival and environmental adaptation of indigenous helmeted Guinea fowls in the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W4281788432,"Plasmin is a broad-spectrum protease and therefore needs to be tightly regulated. Active plasmin is formed from plasminogen, which is found in high concentrations in the blood and is converted by the plasminogen activators. In the circulation, high levels of α2-antiplasmin rapidly and efficiently inhibit plasmin activity. Certain myeloid immune cells have been shown to bind plasmin and plasminogen on their cell surface via proteins that bind to the plasmin(ogen) kringle domains. Our earlier work showed that T cells can activate plasmin but that they do not themselves express plasminogen. Here, we demonstrate that T cells express several known plasminogen receptors and that they bind plasminogen on their cell surface. We show T cell–bound plasminogen was converted to plasmin by plasminogen activators upon T cell activation. To examine functional consequences of plasmin generation by activated T cells, we investigated its effect on the chemokine, C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21). Video microscopy and Western blotting confirmed that plasmin bound by human T cells cleaves CCL21 and increases the chemotactic response of monocyte-derived dendritic cells toward higher CCL21 concentrations along the concentration gradient by increasing their directional migration and track straightness. These results demonstrate how migrating T cells and potentially other activated immune cells may co-opt a powerful proteolytic system from the plasma toward immune processes in the peripheral tissues, where α2-antiplasmin is more likely to be absent. We propose that plasminogen bound to migrating immune cells may strongly modulate chemokine responses in peripheral tissues.

We propose that plasminogen bound to migrating immune cells may strongly modulate chemokine responses in peripheral tissues. Cells such as endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes have been shown to bind plasmin and plasminogen to their cell surface via exposed lysines on cell surface proteins that bind to the plasmin(ogen) kringle domains (1Miles L.A. Parmer R.J. Plasminogen receptors: the first quarter century.Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2013; 39: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The plasmin precursor plasminogen is found in micromolar range concentrations in the blood and is converted to active plasmin by the plasminogen activators tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (2Cederholm-Williams S.A. Concentration of plasminogen and antiplasmin in plasma and serum.J. Clin. Pathol. 1981; 34: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A. Hoover-Plow J.L. The cell biology of the plasminogen system.FASEB J. 1995; 9: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that T cells upregulate tPA when activated (4Loef E.J. Brooks A.E.S. Lorenz N. Birch N.P. Dunbar P.R. Neuroserpin regulates human T cell-T cell interactions and proliferation through inhibition of tissue plasminogen activator.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2020; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), suggesting that localized bursts of immune activation in the tissues might activate plasminogen. Plasmin is a broad-spectrum protease that is tightly regulated. In the circulation, this is achieved by high levels of α2-antiplasmin that rapidly and efficiently inhibits plasmin activity (5Wiman B. Collen D. Purification and characterization of human antiplasmin, the fast-acting plasmin inhibitor in plasma.Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To explain how T cells might activate plasmin outside of the circulation, we hypothesized that they might bind plasminogen in the circulation and carry it into the tissues. Importantly activation of plasminogen by T cells in the tissues could be especially potent because it would evade the abundant α2-antiplasmin present in the circulation. Plasmin(ogen)-binding proteins are often referred to as plasminogen receptors, though they do not always signal in response to binding plasmin(ogen). Some of these molecules can often also bind plasminogen activators and facilitate local activation of plasminogen (1Miles L.A. Parmer R.J. Plasminogen receptors: the first quarter century.Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2013; 39: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Díaz-Ramos À. Roig-Borrellas A. García-Melero A. López-Alemany R. α-Enolase, a multifunctional protein: its role on pathophysiological situations.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2012; 2012: 156795Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The best-characterized plasminogen receptors are the S100A10-annexin A2 heterotetramer, α-enolase, and PLG-RKT (7Kwon M. Macleod T.J. Zhang Y. Waisman D.M. S100A10, annexin A2 and annexin A2 heterotetramer as candidate plasminogen receptors.Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 300-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PLG-RKT is of particular interest since it is the only integral membrane protein that binds plasminogen without requiring release from intracellular sites or proteolytic cleavage of membrane proteins to expose C-terminal lysines (8Miles L.A. Andronicos N.M. Chen E.I. Baik N. Bai H. Parmer C.M. et al.Identification of the novel plasminogen receptor, Plg-RKT.in: Man T. Flores R.J.

Thromb. Haemost. 2020; 18: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether primary human T cells express plasminogen receptors and can bind plasminogen. We found that they express relatively high levels of PLG-RKT, and can bind both plasmin and plasminogen, and facilitate the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. This in vitro evidence supports a model whereby T cells laden with plasminogen from the circulation can convert plasminogen to active plasmin in the peripheral tissues once they encounter their cognate antigen. We then investigated whether plasmin activation by T cells might play a role in controlling immune cell migration in peripheral tissues. Our recent work demonstrated that plasmin is one of the proteases that can truncate the chemokine C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21), by removing its unstructured C-terminal tail (10Lorenz N. Loef E.J. Kelch I.D. Verdon D.J. Black M.M. Middleditch M.J. et al.Plasmin and regulators of plasmin activity control the migratory capacity and adhesion of human T cells and dendritic cells by regulating cleavage of the chemokine CCL21.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2016; 94: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using end-point migration assays, we also showed that plasmin-mediated truncation of CCL21 induces increased migration of human T cells and dendritic cells (10Lorenz N. Loef E.J. Kelch I.D. Verdon D.J. Black M.M. Middleditch M.J. et al.Plasmin and regulators of plasmin activity control the migratory capacity and adhesion of human T cells and dendritic cells by regulating cleavage of the chemokine CCL21.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2016; 94: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Guided cellular migration is essential to mounting immune responses, enabling immune cells to interact optimally with each other and with extracellular matrix (11Krummel M.F. Bartumeus F. Gérard A. T cell migration, search strategies and mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 12Munoz M.A. Biro M. Weninger W. T cell migration in intact lymph nodes in vivo.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 30: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 both drive homing of dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells to the lymph node and facilitate the presentation of antigens from DCs to T cells (13Comerford I. Harata-Lee Y. Bunting M.D. Gregor C. Kara E.E. McColl S.R.

CCL21 is also critical in nonlymphoid tissues for the initial recruitment of T lymphocytes to peripheral effector sites (15Lo J.C. Chin R.K. Lee Y. Kang H.S. Wang Y. Weinstock J.V. et al.Differential regulation of CCL21 in lymphoid/nonlymphoid tissues for effectively attracting T cells to peripheral tissues.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1495-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CCL19 and CCL21 bind to the same receptor, CCR7, yet they induce different effects in target cells (14Hauser M.A. Legler D.F.

Vanes S.L. et al.Distinct CCR7 glycosylation pattern shapes receptor signaling and endocytosis to modulate chemotactic responses.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2016; 99: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The primary difference between CCL19 and CCL21 is the unstructured C-terminal tail on CCL21 (17Barmore A.J. Castex S.M. Gouletas B.A. Griffith A.J. Slater W. Muelder N.G. et al.Transferring the C-terminus of the chemokine CCL21 to CCL19 confers enhanced heparin binding.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 477: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This tail has a net positive charge that allows for binding of CCL21 to extracellular matrix and to glycosaminoglycans. Surface-bound CCL21 facilitates the activation of lymphocyte adhesion molecule LFA-1 and induces trans-endothelial migration (18Johnson L.A. Jackson D.G. Inflammation-induced secretion of CCL21 in lymphatic endothelium is a key regulator of integrinmediated dendritic cell transmigration.Int. Immunol. 2010; 22: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Bound CCL21 can also provide tracks to guide cell migration both with and without a soluble gradient present (19Schumann K. Lämmermann T. Bruckner M. Legler D.F. Polleux J. Spatz J.P. et al.Immobilized chemokine fields and soluble chemokine gradients cooperatively shape migration patterns of dendritic cells.Immunity. 2010; 32: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, CCL21 can also be truncated by proteases that remove the C-terminal chain, so that it loses the ability to bind to the extracellular matrix and subsequently behaves very similarly to CCL19 (19Schumann K. Lämmermann T. Bruckner M. Legler D.F. Polleux J.

Veldkamp C.T. et al.Crystallographic structure of truncated CCL21 and the putative sulfotyrosine-binding site.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 5746-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Since end-point assays cannot always detect subtle changes in chemotaxis (directional migration) and chemokinesis (nondirectional migration) (12Munoz M.A. Biro M. Weninger W. T cell migration in intact lymph nodes in vivo.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 30: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we developed a live-cell microscopy assay that could directly visualize and measure chemokinesis of DCs within a chemokine gradient (21Loef E.J. Sheppard H.M. Birch N.P. Dunbar P.R. Live-cell microscopy reveals that human T cells primarily respond chemokinetically within a CCL19 gradient that induces chemotaxis in dendritic cells.Front. Immunol. 2021; 12: 1-8Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We have now applied this more sophisticated motility assay to confirm that plasmin bound by T cells, similarly to purified plasmin, upregulates the ability of CCL21 to stimulate chemotaxis of human monocyte-derived DCs (mDCs). Overall, our results suggest that plasmin is likely to be generated on the cell surface of T cells recognizing cognate antigen within the tissues by activating plasminogen that they have carried in from the circulation. One possible function of the plasmin that is generated is to induce localized tissue-specific cleavage of CCL21 (and potentially other chemokines that have the same tissue-tethering C-terminal tails) to increase recruitment and motility of other immune cells at sites of T-cell activation. In a previous study, we showed that T cells can activate plasminogen (4Loef E.J. Brooks A.E.S. Lorenz N. Birch N.P. Dunbar P.R. Neuroserpin regulates human T cell-T cell interactions and proliferation through inhibition of tissue plasminogen activator.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2020; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Since plasmin is strongly inhibited in the circulation, we wondered whether lymphocytes could bind plasminogen from plasma and then carry it with them to other tissues, where α2-antiplasmin might not so readily inactivate it. This local activation on the cell surface microenvironment would also allow for significant levels of localized plasmin activity that would not be immediately “mopped up” by plasmin inhibitors. To test whether T cells had the ability to bind plasmin and/or plasminogen, T cells were incubated in the presence or absence of purified plasmin or plasminogen protein under serum-free conditions and then any excess unbound protein was washed away. Bound plasminogen, if present, was activated with exogenously supplied tPA. Cells were then incubated with a plasmin substrate, which yields a fluorescent signal that can be measured over time when cleaved by plasmin. This assay revealed high levels of plasmin activity (and therefore plasmin binding) in T cells that had been incubated with plasmin protein (Fig. 1A) compared to control T cells that had not been incubated with plasmin or the cell-free negative control (where plasmin was washed away). Similar results were obtained when T cells were preincubated with purified plasminogen followed by activation with tPA (Fig. 1B). In this experiment, significant levels of plasmin activity were also observed in T cells that had not been exposed to purified plasminogen compared to protein only controls. This may reflect a carryover of prebound plasminogen from the T-cell culture medium that contains human serum. However, tPA-induced plasmin activity was still significantly increased when cells were preincubated with purified plasminogen (Fig. 1B). We also noted that T cells that activated plasminogen bound to their cell surface generated sixfold higher activity than those directly incubated with plasmin. This could reflect the more physiological generation of plasmin, given that free plasmin will never occur like this in vivo. The most recognized mechanism by which plasmin(ogen) binds to cells is via interactions between the kringle domains on plasmin with exposed lysines on the cell surface (1Miles L.A. Parmer R.J. Plasminogen receptors: the first quarter century.Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2013; 39: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This binding can therefore be disrupted in the presence of excess lysine analogs. When lysine analogs (ε-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) were added during the binding step of our assay, we observed that both plasmin and plasminogen binding to T cells was significantly reduced (see Fig. 1, C and D), indicative of the predicted lysine-specific binding mechanism. Next, direct binding of plasmin and plasminogen to the cells was visualized using Western blot (Fig. 1, E–G). Cells were incubated with 0, 10, or 100 nM plasmin or plasminogen or in medium containing 50% human serum, prior to washing away any unbound plasmin(ogen). Cells were then lysed, and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. Preincubation of T cells with plasmin resulted in the detection of a 26 kDa protein, corresponding to the plasmin light chain (Fig. 1E). Similarly, preincubation of T cells with plasminogen resulted in the detection of a 100 kDa protein, corresponding to purified plasminogen (Fig. 1F). Plasminogen is also observed as a carryover in cells that are precultured in serum-containing media (Fig. 1E). This serum-derived effect is enhanced in the presence of increased concentrations of serum, as expected (Fig. 1G). Knowing that T cells can bind plasmin and plasminogen, the ability to cleave the chemokine CCL21 was then tested. T cells that had bound plasmin following preincubation with excess plasmin had a greater ability to cleave CCL21 than those with no preincubation (Fig. 1H). The cleavage resulted in a truncated product consistent with tail-less CCL21, as previously reported (10Lorenz N. Loef E.J. Kelch I.D. Verdon D.J. Black M.M. Middleditch M.J. et al.Plasmin and regulators of plasmin activity control the migratory capacity and adhesion of human T cells and dendritic cells by regulating cleavage of the chemokine CCL21.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2016; 94: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A similar result was observed with T cells that had been preincubated with plasminogen. However, this effect was only observed when the T cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads. This result is consistent with our previous observations that T cells upregulate the plasminogen activator tPA upon activation (4Loef E.J. Brooks A.E.S. Lorenz N. Birch N.P. Dunbar P.R. Neuroserpin regulates human T cell-T cell interactions and proliferation through inhibition of tissue plasminogen activator.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2020; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, T cell activation can increase the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which is then capable of cleaving CCL21. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that the CCL21 cleavage effect was inhibited in the presence of the specific plasmin inhibitor α2-antiplasmin (Fig. 1I). We hypothesized that lymphocytes express one or more of the best-documented plasmin-binding receptors. Therefore, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to assess the expression of ANXA2, ENO1, PLGRKT, and S100A10 in B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells derived from three individual human donors. We detected mRNA for all four plasminogen receptors in all of the cell types tested (Fig. 2 and Table S1). In both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells high Ct values for ANXA2 and S100A10 and high expression of PLGRKT relative to that detected in monocytes was observed. These data suggest that T cells have the potential to bind plasminogen from the circulation and carry it into tissues as they migrate, where it could be activated by extracellular plasminogen activators such as tPA. We recently demonstrated that an under-agar migration assay used in combination with live-cell microscopy could accurately analyze different parameters of chemotactic and chemokinetic migration of human immune cells in response to CCL19 (21Loef E.J. Sheppard H.M. Birch N.P. Dunbar P.R. Live-cell microscopy reveals that human T cells primarily respond chemokinetically within a CCL19 gradient that induces chemotaxis in dendritic cells.Front. Immunol. 2021; 12: 1-8Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The number of migrating cells, their migration speed and track straightness, and the total displacement of the cells toward the chemotactic signal can be measured over time, typically up to a 6 h final time point when chemokine diffusion has annulled the initial gradient (21Loef E.J. Sheppard H.M. Birch N.P. Dunbar P.R. Live-cell microscopy reveals that human T cells primarily respond chemokinetically within a CCL19 gradient that induces chemotaxis in dendritic cells.Front. Immunol. 2021; 12: 1-8Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We used this assay to first compare various motility parameters of mDC over time in response to CCL21 alone or CCL21 in the presence of plasmin. Few cells were observed migrating toward CCL21 alone (Fig. 3A and Video S1). However, the combination of CCL21 with plasmin led to an increase in the number of migrating cells that showed a statistically significant difference in the response of the cells over the course of the assay and at the 4 to 5 h and 5 to 6 h time points (Fig. 3A and Video S2). A significantly increased displacement pattern of mDCs toward CCL21 with plasmin compared to CCL21 alone was observed over the course of the assay (p ≤ 0.01) and at each hourly time point for the first 5 h of the assay (Fig. 3B). At the end of the 6 h time point, this effect was lost, consistent with our previous work in this experimental system that suggested loss of gradient at this time point (21Loef E.J. Sheppard H.M. Birch N.P. Dunbar P.R. Live-cell microscopy reveals that human T cells primarily respond chemokinetically within a CCL19 gradient that induces chemotaxis in dendritic cells.Front. Immunol. 2021; 12: 1-8Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Similarly, track straightness of mDCs was also significantly increased (Fig. 3C) in the presence of plasmin at every time point, except at 5 to 6 h. When the treatment effect in relation to the time factor was analyzed, there was no significant change, indicating that plasmin increases the track straightness in a similar manner at each time point but not in a time-dependent manner. Finally, when analyzing the effect of plasmin on the migration speed of the cells in response to CCL21-mediated migration, no significant increase was observed (Fig. 3D). This suggests that the primary impact of exposure to CCL21 with plasmin was on the direction of movement (increased straightness and displacement) rather than overall cell motility. Having demonstrated that plasmin bound to T cells could cleave and truncate CCL21, we then wanted to assess if this was functionally relevant to CCL21-mediated migration of mDCs using the live-cell migration assay. Compared to control cells, plasmin-loaded T cells induced a significantly increased chemotactic response over the measured time course, with a statistically significant increase in the number of migrating cells at the 5 to 6 h time point (Fig. 4A) and a significant increase in displacement of mDC toward CCL21 over the complete time course and at the 4 to 5 h time point (Fig. 4B). However, neither track straightness (Fig. 4C) nor migration speed of the mDCs (Fig. 4D) was significantly affected when comparing plasmin loaded or control T cells in this assay. Having also demonstrated that activated T cells could convert bound plasminogen to active plasmin, which can then cleave CCL21, we hypothesized that activated plasminogen-loaded T cells would increase CCL21-mediated migration of mDCs in this assay in a similar way to plasmin loaded T cells. Although there was a similar trend as was observed with the plasmin-loaded T cells, when we compared the number of mDCs migrating toward CCL21 in the presence of plasminogen-loaded T cells, the data failed to reach statistical significance on any migration parameter (Fig. 4, E–G). The lack of statistical significance may reflect confounding limitations within our assay system, such as the presence of 5% human serum, which is known to contain a complex mixture of plasminogen activators and inhibitors (2Cederholm-Williams S.A. Concentration of plasminogen and antiplasmin in plasma and serum.J. Clin. Pathol. 1981; 34: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates for the first time that T cells bind plasminogen, potentially enabling them to carry it out of the circulation and convert it to plasmin in tissue environments following T-cell activation through the release of tPA. When incubated with full-length CCL21, plasmin-bound T cells exert an effect similar to purified plasmin alone, that is, they can functionally truncate CCL21 and increase the chemotactic response of mDCs. The increased displacement of mDCs in response to CCL21 cleaved by plasmin was due to increased track straightness in cell motility, without significant increases in migration speed, consistent with increased chemotaxis. It has been previously reported that monocytes and macrophages express proteins that can bind plasmin and plasminogen on the surface (22Carmo A.A.F. Costa B.R.C. Vago J.P. de Oliveira L.C. Tavares L.P. Nogueira C.R.C. et al.Plasmin induces in vivo monocyte recruitment through protease-activated receptor-1–, MEK/ERK-, and CCR2-mediated signaling.J.

Regulation of macrophage migration by a novel plasminogen receptor Plg-R KT.Blood. 2011; 118: 5622-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and that plasmin activation on the cell surface can affect their function. Considering the broad expression of different plasminogen receptors, it seemed likely that other human immune cells also express these plasminogen receptors and could bind plasmin on their surfaces. Using RT-qPCR, we confirmed that this is indeed the case, as mRNA of four well-characterized plasminogen-binding cell surface proteins was detected on several other immune cell populations. We note that the expression of the PLG-RKT receptor was relatively high on both CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to the other immune cell populations tested. Since PLG-RKT is an integral membrane plasminogen receptor with an extracellular C-terminal lysine, plasmin(ogen) binding is not dependent on preprocessing or other molecular interactions (8Miles L.A. Andronicos N.M. Chen E.I. Baik N. Bai H. Parmer C.M. et al.Identification of the novel plasminogen receptor, Plg-RKT.in: Man T. Flores R.J. Proteomics - Human Diseases and Protein Functions [Internet]. IntechOpen, London2012Google Scholar). Additionally, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed high expression levels of mRNA for ANXA2 and S100A10. This is of particular interest as the ANXA2 and S100A10 heterotetramer has been identified as a receptor for plasmin generation and plasmin-induced signaling (4Loef E.J. Brooks A.E.S. Lorenz N. Birch N.P. Dunbar P.R. Neuroserpin regulates human T cell-T cell interactions and proliferation through inhibition of tissue plasminogen activator.J. Leukoc.

Pharmacol. 2013; 170: 1421-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that plasmin(ogen) binding to T cells is lysine dependent, consistent with lysine-dependent binding through the kringle domain of plasmin(ogen). However, we did not directly investigate whether PLG-RKT or ANXA2 and S100A10 heterotetramer were indeed the main cell surface molecules that bound plasmin(ogen). We have previously reported that plasmin removes the C-terminal peptide of CCL21 (10Lorenz N. Loef E.J. Kelch I.D. Verdon D.J. Black M.M.

The removal of the C-terminal end of CCL21 abolishes its ability to bind to the extracellular matrix or to cell surfaces and induces a shift in the structured domain of CCL21. These changes make CCL21 behave more like the soluble chemokine CCL19, which acts on the same recept"

However, the role and regulation mechanism of lncRNA122049 in ischemic AKI remains unknown. In the present study, we found that lncRNA 122049 protected against the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced apoptosis in BUMPT cells. Mechanistically, the lncRNA 122049 directly sponged miR-330-5p, then increased the expression of ELK1(ETS transcription factor ELK1) to decrease renal cell apoptosis. In addition, miR-330-5p inhibitor completely reversed the pro-apoptotic effect of LncRNA 122049 siRNA on I/R-induced BUMPT cells apoptosis. Finally, overexpression of lncRNA 122049 attenuated ischemic mice AKI via targeting of the miR-330-5p/ELK1 axis. Collectively, the data demonstrated that LncRNA 122049 prevented the I/R-induced renal cell apoptosis via regulation of the miR-330-5p/ELK1 axis, which brings new insights into the pathogenesis and potential targeted treatment of ischemic AKI."
https://openalex.org/W4282555179,"Targeting Toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 2 (TLR4/MD2) signaling is regarded as a potential strategy for treating inflammatory diseases. Saponaria officinalis L. is rich in saponin, which include quillaic acid, gypsogenin, saponarin, and hederagenin. We evaluated the pharmacological activity of a Saponaria officinalis extract in THP-1 derived macrophages and RAW264.7 macrophages. TLR4/MyD88 complex formation and downstream signals were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). In silico docking simulation was conducted to predict binding scores and perform 3D modeling of saponarin-TLR4/MD2 complex. A hexane fraction of Saponaria officinalis (SH) and fr.1 (a sub-fraction 1 of SH) inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB) activity, cytokine production, and the expressions of marker genes specific for M1 polarization. The inhibitory effects of fr.1 and saponarin on TLR4/MyD88 complex formation were observed by western blotting TLR4 co-immunoprecipitated proteins. Saponarin and fr.1 markedly attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, thus reducing mortality and morphological abnormality in zebrafish larvae. Finally, docking simulation revealed that saponarin can directly interact with TLR4/MD2 complex to inhibit downstream signalings. Our findings suggest that saponarin reduces downstream inflammatory response by disrupting TLR4/MD2 complex and blocking MyD88-dependent inflammatory signaling."

London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP) has been formally and informally validated in multiple and diverse settings. However, there is a dearth of literature on the validation of LMUP in Ethiopia either in the Amharic version or other languages.The general objective of this study was to translate the LMUP into Amharic and evaluate its psychometric properties in a sample of Amharic-speaking women receiving antenatal care (ANC) service at public health facilities in Arbaminch and Birbir towns.A cross-sectional study design was used for the study. Forward and backward translation of original English LMUP to Amharic was done. A cognitive interview using a pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from respondents. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, inter-item correlations, and corrected item-total correlations while construct validity was assessed using principal components analysis and hypothesis testing.Data was collected from 320 women attending antennal care services at selected public health care facilities. LMUP range of 1to 11 was captured. The prevalence of unplanned pregnancies was 19(5.9%), while 136(42.5 were ambivalent and 165(51.6%) were planned pregnancies. The reliability testing demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.799) and the validity testing confirmed the unidimensional structure of the scale. In addition, all hypotheses were confirmed.Amharic version of LMUP is a valid and reliable tool to measure pregnancy intention so that it can be used by Amharic speaking population in Ethiopia. It can also be used in research studies among Amharic-speaking women to measure unplanned pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4282589308,"The DeLong Mountain Transportation System (DMTS) haul road links the Red Dog Mine—one of the world’s largest zinc mines—with a shipping port on the Chukchi Sea in northwest Alaska, USA. The road traverses 32 km of National Park Service (NPS) lands managed by Cape Krusenstern National Monument (CAKR). Fugitive dusts from ore concentrate transport and mining operations have dispersed zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and metal sulfides onto NPS lands since the mine began operating in 1989. This study assessed the effects of metal-enriched road dusts on the diversity and community structure of lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants in dwarf-shrub tundra within CAKR. In a Bayesian posterior predictions model, lichen species richness (LSR) was highly correlated to distance from the haul road and was distributed on the landscape consistently with the spatial patterns of Zn, Pb and Cd patterns published earlier in this journal. The mean modeled LSR of the 3000–4000 m distance class was 41.3, and LSR decreased progressively down to 9.4 species in the 0–50 m class. An ordination of 93 lichen species by 91 plots revealed strong community patterns based on distance from the haul road. The major community gradient was highly correlated (r = 0.99) with LSR and negatively correlated with Cd, Pb and Zn (-0.79 &lt; r &lt; -0.74). Ordinations of bryophyte classes showed less response than lichens to distance from the road and heavy metals values, and vascular plant ordination showed less still. Measures of bryophyte health such as the midrib blackening and frond width of Hylocomium splendens were positively correlated with distance from the haul road and negatively correlated with this same suite of elements. A total area of approximately 55 km 2 showed moderate to strong impacts on lichens from fugitive dusts. This is equivalent to an area of almost 1 km on both sides of the haul road running 32 km through CAKR."

Herein, we explored the mechanisms that activate the ISR and execute changes in transcription and translation according to the missing EAA. Wild-type mice and mice lacking general control nonderepressible 2 (Gcn2) were fed an amino acid complete diet or a diet devoid of either leucine or sulfur amino acids (methionine and cysteine). Serum and liver leucine concentrations were significantly reduced within the first 6 h of feeding a diet lacking leucine, corresponding with modest, GCN2-dependent increases in Atf4 mRNA translation and induction of selected ISR target genes (Fgf21, Slc7a5, Slc7a11). In contrast, dietary removal of the sulfur amino acids lowered serum methionine, but not intracellular methionine, and yet hepatic mRNA abundance of Atf4, Fgf21, Slc7a5, Slc7a11 substantially increased regardless of GCN2 status. Liver tRNA charging levels did not correlate with intracellular EAA concentrations or GCN2 status and remained similar to mice fed a complete diet. Furthermore, loss of Gcn2 increased the occurrence of ribosome collisions in liver and derepressed mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signal transduction, but these changes did not influence execution of the ISR. We conclude that ISR activation is directed by intracellular EAA concentrations, but ISR execution is not. Furthermore, a diet devoid of sulfur amino acids does not require GCN2 for the ISR to execute changes to the transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W4281997333,"We have previously shown that the serine/threonine kinase PKCα triggers MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-dependent G1→S cell cycle arrest in intestinal epithelial cells, characterized by downregulation of cyclin D1 and inhibitor of DNA-binding protein 1 (Id1) and upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1. Here, we use pharmacological inhibitors, genetic approaches, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and immunoprecipitation to further characterize antiproliferative ERK signaling in intestinal cells. We show that PKCα signaling intersects the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade at the level of Ras small GTPases and that antiproliferative effects of PKCα require active Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK, core ERK pathway components that are also essential for pro-proliferative ERK signaling induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF). However, PKCα-induced antiproliferative signaling differs from EGF signaling in that it is independent of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Ras-GEFs), SOS1/2, and involves prolonged rather than transient ERK activation. PKCα forms complexes with A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf that dissociate upon pathway activation, and all three Raf isoforms can mediate PKCα-induced antiproliferative effects. At least two PKCα-ERK pathways that collaborate to promote growth arrest were identified: one pathway requiring the Ras-GEF, RasGRP3, and H-Ras, leads to p21Cip1 upregulation, while additional pathway(s) mediate PKCα-induced cyclin D1 and Id1 downregulation. PKCα also induces ERK-dependent SOS1 phosphorylation, indicating possible negative crosstalk between antiproliferative and growth-promoting ERK signaling. Importantly, the spatiotemporal activation of PKCα and ERK in the intestinal epithelium in vivo supports the physiological relevance of these pathways and highlights the importance of antiproliferative ERK signaling to tissue homeostasis in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W4282550994,"Significant liver fibrosis regression occurs after hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy. However, the impact of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) on steatosis is less clear. This study was aimed at evaluating serial fibrosis and steatosis alterations in patients with HCV genotype 1, who achieved sustained virological response (SVR). We enrolled 55 HCV mono-infected and 28 HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir from a clinical trial. Fibrosis and steatosis were assessed at baseline, follow-up week-24 (FUw24) and week-72 (FUw72) by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and proton density fat fraction (PDFF), respectively. Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409, transmembrane six superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) rs58542926 and membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7) rs641738 polymorphisms were determined by allelic discrimination. Overall, mean MRE decreased significantly from baseline to FUw24 and FUw72. At FUw72, patients with baseline F2-F4 had higher rate of ≥30% MRE decline compared with individuals with baseline F0-F1 (30.2%vs.3.3%, P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, significant fibrosis was associated with MRE reduction. The prevalence of steatosis (PDFF≥5.2%) at baseline was 21.7%. Compared to baseline, there were 17 (20.5%) patients with decreased PDFF values at FUw72 (<30%), while 23 (27.7%) patients had increased PDFF values (≥30%). Regarding the overall cohort, mean PDFF significantly increased from baseline to FUw72, and displayed positive correlation with body mass index (BMI) alteration. In multivariate analysis, the presence of diabetes, PNPLA3 CG+GG genotypes and increased BMI at FUw72 were significantly associated with progressive steatosis after SVR. Other genetic variants were not related to fibrosis and steatosis alteration. This study concluded that HCV eradication was associated with fibrosis improvement. However, progressive steatosis was observed in a proportion of patients, particularly among individuals with metabolic derangement and PNPLA3 variants. The combined clinical parameters and host genetic factors might allow a better individualized strategy in this sub-group of patients to alleviate progressive steatosis after HCV cure."
https://openalex.org/W4282827894,"Objectives The study assessed a smartphone-based technology system, which was designed to enable six participants with intellectual disability and sensory impairment to start and carry out functional activities through the use of reminders and verbal or pictorial instructions. Methods The technology system involved a Samsung Galaxy A22 with Android 11 operating system and four Philips Hue indoor motion sensors. Three to five activities were scheduled per day. At the time at which an activity was due, the system provided the participant with a reminder followed by the verbal or pictorial instruction for the initial part of the first response (e.g., “Go to the bathroom and take the dirty towels”). The instruction would be available (repeated) until the participant responded to it and, in so doing, activated a sensor. Sensor activation caused the presentation of the instruction for the second part of the same (first) response (e.g., “Put the towels in the laundry machine”). The same process occurred for each of the responses involved in the activity. The system was introduced according to nonconcurrent multiple baseline designs across participants. Results During baseline, the mean percentage of activities the participants started independently was below 7; the mean frequency of correct responses per activity was below 0.5 (out of a maximum possible of 8). During the intervention (i.e., with the support of the technology system), the mean percentage and mean frequency values increased to nearly 100 and 8, respectively. Conclusions The data suggest that the aforementioned technology system may enable people with intellectual disability and sensory impairment to start and carry out functional activities independent of staff."
https://openalex.org/W4282830644,"Smad7 restrains TGF-β responses, and has been suggested to exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions that may involve effects on macrophages. Myocardial infarction triggers a macrophage-driven inflammatory response that not only plays a central role in cardiac repair, but also contributes to adverse remodeling and fibrosis. We hypothesized that macrophage Smad7 expression may regulate inflammation and fibrosis in the infarcted heart through suppression of TGF-β responses, or via TGF-independent actions. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, infiltration with Smad7+ macrophages peaked 7 days after coronary occlusion. Myeloid cell-specific Smad7 loss in mice had no effects on homeostatic functions and did not affect baseline macrophage gene expression. RNA-seq predicted that Smad7 may promote TREM1-mediated inflammation in infarct macrophages. However, these alterations in the transcriptional profile of macrophages were associated with a modest and transient reduction in infarct myofibroblast infiltration, and did not affect dysfunction, chamber dilation, scar remodeling, collagen deposition, and macrophage recruitment. In vitro, RNA-seq and PCR arrays showed that TGF-β has profound effects on macrophage profile, attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression, modulating synthesis of matrix remodeling genes, inducing genes associated with sphingosine-1 phosphate activation and integrin signaling, and inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis genes. However, Smad7 loss did not significantly affect TGF-β-mediated macrophage responses, modulating synthesis of only a small fraction of TGF-β-induced genes, including Itga5, Olfml3, and Fabp7. Our findings suggest a limited role for macrophage Smad7 in regulation of post-infarction inflammation and repair, and demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effects of TGF-β in macrophages are not restrained by endogenous Smad7 induction."
https://openalex.org/W4282551465,"A proportionate universal (PU) approach to early years' service provision has been advocated to improve children's health and development and to reduce health inequality, by ensuring that services provide timely and high-quality parenting support commensurate with need. Process-oriented research is critical to examine the factors that contribute to, or hinder, the effective delivery/implementation of such a model in community-based family services. This study aimed to assess the delivery, acceptability and feasibility of a new PU parenting intervention model (called E-SEE Steps), using the Incredible Years® (IY) parent program, when delivered by trained health/family service staff in three ""steps""-one universal step (the IY Babies Book), and two targeted steps (group-based IY Infant and Toddler programs).An embedded mixed-methods process evaluation within a pragmatic parallel two-arm, assessor blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted in community services in four local authorities in England. The process evaluation used qualitative data gathered via interviews and focus groups with intervention arm parents who were offered the targeted steps (n = 29), practitioners (n = 50), service managers (n = 7) and IY program mentors (n = 3). This was supplemented by quantitative data collected using group leader pre-training (n = 50) and post-delivery (n = 39) questionnaires, and research notes of service design decisions.The E-SEE Steps model was acceptable to most parents, particularly when it was accompanied by engagement strategies that supported attendance, such as providing childcare. Practitioners also highlighted the positive development opportunities provided by the IY training and supervision. However, participant views did not support the provision of the IY Babies book as a standalone universal component, and there were barriers to eligible parents-particularly those with low mood-taking up the targeted programs. Service providers struggled to align the PU model with their commissioned service contracts and with their staff capacity to engage appropriate parents, including tackling common barriers to attendance.Despite general enthusiasm and support for delivering high-quality parenting programs in community services in the England, several barriers exist to successfully delivering IY in a proportionate universal model within current services/systems."
https://openalex.org/W4282555488,"Septic patients commonly present with central nervous system (CNS) disorders including impaired consciousness and delirium. Today, the main mechanism regulating sepsis-induced cerebral disorders is believed to be neuroinflammation. However, it is unknown how another component of the CNS, the spinal cord, is influenced during sepsis. In the present study, we intraperitoneally injected mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to investigate molecular and immunohistochemical changes in the spinal cord of a sepsis model. After LPS administration in the spinal cord, pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA were rapidly and drastically induced. Twenty-four-hour after the LPS injection, severe neuronal ischemic damage spread into gray matter, especially around the anterior horns, and the anterior column had global edematous changes. Immunostaining analyses showed that spinal microglia were significantly activated and increased, but astrocytes did not show significant change. The current results indicate that sepsis induces acute neuroinflammation, including microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation in the spinal cord, causing drastic neuronal ischemia and white matter edema in the spinal cord."

The purpose of this study was to identify the spectra of FGIDs classified according to the ROME III criteria amongst an adult Pakistani population. It also aimed to correlate the psychosocial alarm symptoms with the prevalence of FGIDs and report the overlap of all FGID.This was a community based cross-sectional study. Multi-stage cluster sampling technique was applied, and 1062 households were initially randomly chosen using systematic sampling technique. Only one person from each household was enrolled in the study. After eligibility screening, 860 participating individuals were requested to fill out a structured ROME III interview questionnaire, administered to them by a trained interviewer.FGIDs were diagnosed in 468 individuals (54.4%), out of 860 participants. FD was found to be the most prevalent (70.2%), followed by Functional Heartburn (58.9%) and Functional bloating (56.6%). Amongst a total of 468 participants diagnosed with FGIDs, 347 (74.1%) had overlapping disorders. There was also a higher incidence of psychosocial alarm symptoms including higher pain severity (62.6% vs 46.4%) and being victimized at some point in their lives (26.1% vs 6.6%) amongst FGID patients.There is a high disease burden of FGIDs in this study population, with approximately half of the population suffering from at least one type of FGID. Overlapping disorders are also common in this part of the world."
https://openalex.org/W4282586304,"NgBR is the Nogo-B receptor, encoded by NUS1 gene. As NgBR contains a C-terminal domain that is similar to cis-isoprenyltransferase (cis-IPTase), NgBR was speculated to stabilize nascent Niemann-Pick type C 2 (NPC2) to facilitate cholesterol transport out of lysosomes. Mutations in the NUS1 were known as risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). In our previous study, it was shown that knockdown of Drosophila NUS1 orthologous gene tango14 causes decreased climbing ability, loss of dopaminergic neurons, and decreased dopamine contents. In this study, tango14 mutant flies were generated with a mutation in the C-terminal enzyme activity region using CRISPR/Cas9. Tango14 mutant showed a reduced lifespan with locomotive defects and cholesterol accumulation in Malpighian tubules and brains, especially in dopaminergic neurons. Multilamellar bodies were found in tango14 mutants using electron microscopy. Neurodegenerative-related brain vacuolization was also detected in tango14 knockdown flies in an age-dependent manner. In addition, tango14 knockdown increased α-synuclein (α-syn) neurotoxicity in α-syn-overexpressing flies, with decreased locomotive activities, dopamine contents, and the numbers of dopaminergic neurons in aging flies. Thus, these observations suggest a role of NUS1, the ortholog of tango14, in PD-related pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4282827008,"Before the pandemic, many employers were hesitant to offer their employees the option of working from home. However, remote working has been widely adopted during the pandemic as one of the key methods of controlling the spread of the virus. The measure encountered a widespread acceptance and it is likely that the demand for work from home as a flexible work arrangement will persist also after the pandemic has ended. Although numerous studies have addressed the role of remote work during this crisis, as of yet we lack thorough research jointly addressing the question on how occupations/job characteristics on the one hand and family/household responsibilities on the other are associated with the propensity of working from home, and how gender cuts across those aspects. Using the COVID-19 survey of the German Family Panel ( pairfam ), covering the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, together with information from pairfam panel waves conducted before the pandemic, as well as a special evaluation of the 2019 German Labor Force Survey, we are able to address this gap. Employing linear probability models on a sample of 1,414 men (N = 641) and women (N = 773), our results show that occupational traits, especially the gender composition of an occupation, are an important predictor for working from home. Women employed in female-dominated occupations are less often in a position to work from home. Furthermore, our study confirms that it is particularly the highly educated, as well as those who work in high-prestige occupations, who are able to work from home. Family configurations and care obligations are less influential upon the transition to homeworking, even in times of an unprecedented situation of school and daycare closures and increased parental responsibilities for children’s (early) education."

After this study we report that the plasma levels of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were higher in individuals with evidence of prior infection who received at least one dose of either an mRNA-based vaccine (Comirnaty BNT162b2/Pfizer-BioNTech or Spikevax mRNA-1273/Moderna) or an adenoviral-based vaccine (Vaxzervia ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 /Oxford-Astra Zeneca) (n = 39) compared to i) unvaccinated individuals with evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 109) and ii) individuals without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 who received one or two doses of one of the aforementioned vaccines (n = 342). Our analysis also revealed that regardless of the vaccine technology (mRNA-based and adenoviral vector-based) two doses achieved high anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses. Our results indicate that vaccine-induced responses lead to higher levels of IgG antibodies compared to those produced following infection with the virus. Additionally, in agreement with previous studies, our results suggest that among individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, even a single dose of a vaccine is adequate to elicit high levels of antibody response."
https://openalex.org/W4282835274,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a defining characteristic feature of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) that frequently results in irreversible vision loss. The current strategies for the treatment of nAMD are mainly based on neutralizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, anti-VEGF therapies are often associated with subretinal fibrosis that eventually leads to damages in macula. In this study, we tested whether an anti-fibrotic and anti-angiogenic protein CCN5 can potentially be an effective and safe therapeutic modality in a mouse model of CNV. Laser photocoagulation was utilized to induce CNV, which was followed by intravitreal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 encoding CCN5 (rAAV2-CCN5). Our data demonstrated that rAAV2-CCN5, but not a control viral vector, rAAV2-VLP, prominently attenuated both CNV lesions and angiogenesis. Aflibercept, which was utilized as a positive control, exhibited similar effects on CNV lesions and angiogenesis in our experimental settings. Upon laser photocoagulation, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells underwent significant morphological changes including cellular enlargement and loss of hexagonality. rAAV2-CCN5 significantly normalized these morphological defects. Laser photocoagulation also led to fibrotic deformation in RPE cells through inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was completely blocked by rAAV2-CCN5. In a striking contrast, aflibercept as well as rAAV2-VLP failed to exhibit any effects on EMT. Collectively, this study suggest that CCN5 might provide a potential novel strategy for the treatment of nAMD with a capability to inhibit CNV and fibrosis simaultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W4282839894,"While patients with cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis are easily diagnosed with bone scintigraphy, the detection of cardiac light chain (AL) amyloidosis is challenging. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) analyses play an essential role in the differential diagnosis of cardiomyopathies; however, limited data are available from cardiac AL-Amyloidosis. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to analyze the potential role of CMR in the detection of cardiac AL-amyloidosis.We included 35 patients with proved cardiac AL-amyloidosis and two control groups constituted by 330 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 70 patients with arterial hypertension (HT), who underwent CMR examination. The phenotype and degree of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and the amount and pattern of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) were evaluated. In addition, global and regional LV strain parameters were also analyzed using feature-tracking techniques. Sensitivity and specificity of several CMR parameters were analyzed in diagnosing cardiac AL-amyloidosis.The sensitivity and specificity of diffuse septal subendocardial LGE in diagnosing cardiac AL-amyloidosis was 88% and 100%, respectively. Likewise, the sensitivity and specificity of septal myocardial nulling prior to blood pool was 71% and 100%, respectively. In addition, a LV end-diastolic septal wall thickness ≥ 15 mm had an optimal diagnostic performance to differentiate cardiac AL-amyloidosis from HT (sensitivity 91%, specificity 89%). On the other hand, a reduced global LV longitudinal strain (< 15%) plus apical sparing (apex-to-base longitudinal strain > 2) had a very low sensitivity (6%) in detecting AL-Amyloidosis, but with very high specificity (100%).The findings from this study suggest that CMR could have an optimal diagnostic performance in the diagnosis of cardiac AL-amyloidosis. Hence, further larger studies are warranted to validate the findings from this study."
https://openalex.org/W4282840668,"Heavy-metal pollution has been established to affect ginseng quality. However, this effect is still unknown in ginseng of different ages, emphasizing the need to investigate the effects of heavy metals in soils on ginseng growth. Herein, we determined the content of heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, and As) in ginseng of different ages (2 to 6-year-old) and the corresponding soil samples. Then, the total ginsenosides content of ginseng and rate-limiting enzyme (HMGR, SQE, CYP450) activity in the synthesis of ginsenosides were assessed. Results from 200 differently-aged Chinese ginseng showed that increased ginsenoside content in 3 to 5-year-old ginseng was paralleled by increased heavy metal element content in ginseng and its soil. The activity of rate-limiting enzymes increased in the first four years of ginseng growth and then exhibited a steady or downward trend. Further analysis suggested that heavy metal elements in soils could directly affect ginsenoside content. Moreover, we found that Cu significantly affected the rate-limiting enzyme CYP450 activity. Further principal component analysis and correlation analysis found that heavy metals could obviously inhibit ginseng growth during the 5th and 6th years. Heavy metal content in soils has huge prospects for predicting ginsenoside, Cu and As content in ginseng. This study provided support for ginseng cultivation, quality research and quality assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4281613944,"Aflatoxins are a series of highly toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites that are synthesized by Aspergillus species. The degradation of aflatoxin enzymes is an important regulatory mechanism which modulates mycotoxin producing. The retromer complex is responsible for the retrograde transport of specific biomolecules and the vacuolar fusion in the intracellular transport. Late endosomal-associated GTPase (Rab7) has been shown to be a downstream effector protein of the retromer complex. A deficiency in the retromer complex or Rab7 results in several cellular trafficking problems in yeast and humans, like protein abnormal accumulation. However, whether retromer dysfunction is involved in aflatoxin synthesis remains unclear. Here, we report that the core retromer complex, which comprises three vacuolar protein sorting-associated proteins (AflVps26-AflVps29-AflVps35), is essential for the development of dormant and resistant fungal forms such as conidia (asexual reproductive spore) and sclerotia (hardened fungal mycelium), as well as aflatoxin production and pathogenicity, in Aspergillus flavus. In particular, we show the AflVps26-AflVps29-AflVps35 complex is negatively correlated with aflatoxin exportation. Structural simulation, site-specific mutagenesis, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that interactions among AflVps26, AflVps29, and AflVps35 played crucial roles in the retromer complex executing its core functions. We further found an intrinsic connection between AflRab7 and the retromer involved in vesicle-vacuole fusion, which in turn affected the accumulation of aflatoxin synthesis-associated enzymes, suggesting that they work together to regulate the production of toxins. Overall, these results provide mechanistic insights that contribute to our understanding of the regulatory role of the core retromer complex in aflatoxin metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4281653989,"Osteoporosis affects approximately 200 million people and severely affects quality of life, but the exact pathological mechanisms behind this disease remain unclear. Various miRNAs have been shown to play a predominant role in the regulation of osteoclast formation. In this study, we explored the role of miR-134-5p in osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. We constructed an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model and performed microarray analysis using bone tissue from OVX mice and their control counterparts. Quantitative RT-PCR data from bone tissue and bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) confirmed the decreased expression of miR-134-5p in OVX mice observed in microarray analysis. In addition, a decrease in miR-134-5p was also observed during induced osteoclastogenesis of BMMs collected from C57BL/6N mice. Through transfection with miR-134-5p agomirs and antagomirs, we found that miR-134-5p knockdown significantly accelerated osteoclast formation and cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-134-5p directly targets the integrin surface receptor gene Itgb1. Cotransfection with Itgb1 siRNA reversed the effect of the miR-134-5p antagomir in promoting osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, the abundance levels of MAPK pathway proteins phosphorylated-p38 (p-p38) and phosphorylated-ERK (p-ERK) were significantly increased after transfection with the miR-134-5p antagomir but decreased after transfection with the miR-134-5p agomir or Itgb1 siRNA, which indicated a potential relationship between the miR-134-5p/Itgb1 axis and the MAPK pathway. Collectively, these results revealed that miR-134-5p inhibits osteoclast differentiation of BMMs both in vivo and in vitro and that the miR-134-5p/Itgb1/MAPK pathway might be a potential target for osteoporosis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4281771161,"The metal-dependent M17 aminopeptidases are conserved throughout all kingdoms of life. This large enzyme family is characterized by a conserved binuclear metal center and a distinctive homohexameric arrangement. Recently, we showed that hexamer formation in Plasmodium M17 aminopeptidases was controlled by the metal ion environment, although the functional necessity for hexamer formation is still unclear. To further understand the mechanistic role of the hexameric assembly, here we undertook an investigation of the structure and dynamics of the M17 aminopeptidase from Plasmodium falciparum, PfA-M17. We describe a novel structure of PfA-M17, which shows that the active sites of each trimer are linked by a dynamic loop, and loop movement is coupled with a drastic rearrangement of the binuclear metal center and substrate-binding pocket, rendering the protein inactive. Molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical analyses of PfA-M17 variants demonstrated that this rearrangement is inherent to PfA-M17, and that the transition between the active and inactive states is metal dependent and part of a dynamic regulatory mechanism. Key to the mechanism is a remodeling of the binuclear metal center, which occurs in response to a signal from the neighboring active site and serves to moderate the rate of proteolysis under different environmental conditions. In conclusion, this work identifies a precise mechanism by which oligomerization contributes to PfA-M17 function. Furthermore, it describes a novel role for metal cofactors in the regulation of enzymes, with implications for the wide range of metalloenzymes that operate via a two-metal ion catalytic center, including DNA processing enzymes and metalloproteases."

The subjects of this study included whole participants for oral examinations for infants and toddlers of the National Health Insurance Corporation. A retrospective cohort study was designed and measured all oral treatments, costs, and number of visits for 208,969 children (experimental group, 101,768; non- experimental group, 107,201) who underwent oral examination for infants and toddlers from 2007 to 2014. The cost-effectiveness was measured using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and the T-health index was used as the measurement for effectiveness. In addition, the difference in the effect according to the level of regional deprivation was confirmed.The findings of this study showed that EDVs were cost-effective and that children who participated in EDVs had better oral health (T-health-2 index difference 0.32 point in most deprived regions) and needed 5 USD less costly dental treatments than those who did not have EDVs. The cost-effectiveness of EDVs varied according to the level of regional deprivation and was the highest in the most deprived regions.The study findings suggested that the provision of oral examination for infants and toddlers was a cost-effective dental policy. Additionally, EDVs were more effective in children who resided in the most deprived regions, a finding that will lead to the development of policy intervention to improve dental care despite spatial inequality for disadvantaged population groups. Regarding the distribution of dental hospitals/clinics, incentive based dental polices for either dental providers or patients are needed that will assure the delivery of dental care despite spatial inequality."
https://openalex.org/W4282580172,"The transcription factor Nrf2 modulates the initiation and progression of a number of diseases including liver disorders. We evaluated whether Nrf2 mediates hepatic adaptive responses to cholestasis. Wild-type and Nrf2-null mice were subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) or a sham operation. As cholestasis progressed to day 15 post-BDL, hepatocytes in the wild-type mice exhibited a tendency to dedifferentiate, indicated by the very weak expression of hepatic progenitor markers: CD133 and tumor necrosis factor-like weak induced apoptosis receptor (Fn14). During the same period, Nrf2 deficiency augmented this tendency, manifested by higher CD133 expression, earlier, stronger, and continuous induction of Fn14 expression, and markedly reduced albumin production. Remarkably, as cholestasis advanced to the late stage (40 days after BDL), hepatocytes in the wild-type mice exhibited a Fn14+ phenotype and strikingly upregulated the expression of deleted in malignant brain tumor 1 (DMBT1), a protein essential for epithelial differentiation during development. In contrast, at this stage, hepatocytes in the Nrf2-null mice entirely inhibited the upregulation of DMBT1 expression, displayed a strong CD133+/Fn14+ phenotype indicative of severe dedifferentiation, and persistently reduced albumin production. We revealed that Nrf2 maintains hepatocytes in the differentiated state potentially via the increased activity of the Nrf2/DMBT1 pathway during cholestasis."
https://openalex.org/W4282580748,"To date basic visualization of sequence alignments have largely focused on displaying per-site columns of nucleotide, or amino acid, residues along with associated frequency summarizations. The persistence of this tendency to the recent tools designed for viewing mapped read data indicates that such a perspective not only provides a reliable visualization of per-site alterations, but also offers implicit reassurance to the end-user in relation to data accessibility. However, the initial insight gained is limited, something that is especially true when viewing alignments consisting of many sequences representing differing factors such as location, date and subtype. A basic alignment viewer can have potential to increase initial insight through visual enhancement, whilst not delving into the realms of complex sequence analysis. We present CView, a visualizer that expands on the per-site representation of residues through the incorporation of a dynamic network that is based on the summarization of diversity present across different regions of the alignment. Within the network, nodes are based on the clustering of sequence fragments that span windows placed consecutively along the alignment. Edges are placed between nodes of neighbouring windows where they share sequence identification(s), i.e. different regions of the same sequence(s). Thus, if a node is selected on the network, then the relationship that sequences passing through that node have to other regions of diversity within the alignment can be observed through path tracing. In addition to augmenting visual insight, CView provides export features including variant summarization, per-site residue and kmer frequencies, consensus sequence, alignment dissection as well as clustering; each useful across a range of research areas. The software has been designed to be user friendly, intuitive and interactive. It is open source and an executable jar, source code, quick start, usage tutorial and test data are available (under the GNU General Public License) from https://sourceforge.net/projects/cview/."

To help address these concerns, we introduce a method allowing researchers to investigate an important, widespread form of altruistic behavior-charitable donations-in a manner balancing competing concerns about internal validity, ecological validity, and ease of implementation: relief registries, which leverage existing online gift registry platforms to allow research subjects to choose among highly needed donation items to ship directly to charitable organizations. Here, we demonstrate the use of relief registries in two experiments exploring the ecological validity of the finding from our own research that people are more willing to help others after having imagined themselves doing so. In this way, we sought to provide a blueprint for researchers seeking to enhance the ecological validity of their own research in a narrow sense (i.e., by using the relief registry method we introduce) and in broader terms by adapting methods that take advantage of modern technology to directly impact others' lives outside the lab."

We sought to determine the structure of a small-mammal community in terms of mammal abundance and infection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti within a fragmented landscape in Essex County, Massachusetts, USA. We studied communities at multiple spatial scales, including vegetation, edge type, and landscape (including 200-m, 500-m, and 1000-m radii) scales. A total of 16 study sites were chosen to represent four edge types: interior forest, pasture edge, natural edge, and residential edge. At each site, we trapped small mammals and conducted vegetation surveys and GIS analysis. Upon capture, a tissue sample was collected to analyze for presence of pathogens. Northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) abundance did not differ based on edge type, whereas abundance of the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) was greatest at pasture edges, although the relationship was relatively weak. White-footed mouse abundance was negatively associated with amount of forested area within a 500-m radius, whereas northern short-tailed shrew abundance demonstrated a positive relationship with fragmentation indices at the 200-m radius. White-footed mice captured at interior-forest habitat were more likely be infected with B. burgdorferi (s.s.) than individuals from edge habitat. Greater prevalence of B. burgdorferi infection of white-footed mice in forest interiors compared to edge habitats counters previous studies. Reasons for this and implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4282588520,"Examinations of corporate power have demonstrated the practices and activities Unhealthy Commodity Industries (UCIs) employ to exert their power and influence on the public and health policy. The High in Fat Sugar and Salt (HFSS) product industry have exploited the online environment to market their products to young people. Regulating UCIs’ marketing can limit the power of those industries and is argued to be one of the most appropriate policy responses to such marketing. However, there is minimal consideration of how stakeholders view regulation of online advertising of HFSS products to young people. This UK-focused study addressed this through a secondary analysis of focus groups with young people (n = 15), the primary analysis of focus groups with parents (n = 8), and interviews with professional stakeholders (n = 11). The findings indicated that participants’ views on the regulation of online advertising of HFSS products were informed by how professional stakeholders exerted instrumental, structural and discursive power. Participants cited regulation as a means to re-negotiate problematic power dynamics to increase young people’s and parents’ autonomy over young people’s diets, yet concern remained as to the impact regulation may have on individual autonomy. To garner increased public support for such regulatory policies, it may be beneficial for advocates to emphasise the empowering elements of those regulatory policies. Advocacy actors may wish to shift their framing of regulation from one that focuses on restricting industry practices, to one that centres on empowering individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4282591948,"Background Residents of Nursing Homes (NHs) have suffered greater impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rates of COVID-19 in these institutions are heterogeneously distributed. Describing and understanding the structural, functional, and socioeconomic differences between NHs is extremely important to avoid new outbreaks. Objectives Analyze inequalities in the cumulative incidences (CIs) and in the mortality rates (MRs) due to COVID-19 in the NHs of Barcelona based on the characteristics of the NHs. Methods Exploratory ecological study of 232 NHs. The dependent variables were the cumulative incidence and mortality rate due to COVID-19 in NHs between March and June 2020. Structural variables of the NHs were evaluated such as neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP), isolation and sectorization capacity, occupancy, overcrowding and ownership. Results The cumulative incidence and mortality rate were higher in the low SEP neighborhoods and lower in those of high SEP neighborhoods. Regarding the isolation and sectorization capacity, Type B NHs had a higher risk of becoming infected and dying, while Type C had a lower risk of dying than Type A. Greater overcrowding was associated with greater morbidity and mortality, and higher occupancy was associated with higher incidence. The risk of becoming infected and dying in public NHs was significantly higher than for-profit NH. Conclusions The social components together with the functional and infrastructure characteristics of the NHs influence the cumulative incidence and the mortality rate by COVID-19. It is necessary to redefine the care model in the NHs to guarantee the health of the residents."

Among the precautionary measures, facemask was mostly emphasized. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of dermatological symptoms linked with face mask usage and explore other associated factors. This cross-sectional survey was conducted throughout all eight divisions of Bangladesh. 1297 people were approached using a fixed-step procedure on a random route sample where 803 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of dermatological manifestation in this study was 40.85%. The common dermatological manifestations due to facemasks use were acne (26%), allergy symptoms (24%), traumatic symptoms (24%), and other symptoms (26%). Two important frequently reported risk factors were previous history of skin diseases and obesity. Females were more likely to have acne (CI: 1.199, 3.098; p = .007) and allergy issues (CI: 1.042, 2.359; p = .031). N95 and KN95 masks were more likely to produce allergic symptoms, while surgical mask users were more likely to develop acne. Acne was prevalent more than twice (CI: 1.42, 4.26; p = 0.001) in persons with a COVID-19 infection history. Further exploration is required to find out the reason. Surgical mask users reported more complaints than other types of masks, and prolonged use caused more skin symptoms. Modifications in the pattern of facemask usage and planning for work recesses might also be advised to provide for a pause from uninterrupted facemask use."

This study evaluates the pesticide use in vegetables from two provinces in Central Vietnamand and present data on pesticides detected in vegetables sampled from the sites. The potential health risk associated with the contamination of four commonly used pesticides in different vegetables is also discussed. Both household surveys and monitoring campaigns were conducted. The survey showed that improper pesticide application, storage, and waste disposal prevailed at the study sites. Only 20% of the respondent were aware of pesticide toxicity. As a result, pesticides were detected in 81% out of 290 vegetable samples collected at harvesting time. Up to 23% of samples had pesticide residues above the Maximum Residue Limit values. The highest total pesticide concentration quantified in vegetables in Thua Thien Hue was 11.9 mg/kg (green onions), and in Quang Binh was 38.6 mg/kg (mustard greens). Median residue levels of individual pesticides in vegetables ranged from 0.007 to 0.037 mg/kg. Among the ten target pesticides, cypermethrin, difenoconazole, and fenobucarb were detected at the highest frequencies (72%, 41%, and 37%, respectively). Pesticide residues varied between seasons at both study provinces. Pesticide contamination in the wet season was significantly higher than in the dry season. This study also discovered a potential health risk associated with fipronil residues in vegetables in Thua Thien Hue province. The paper provides recommendations for mitigation measures (both technological and social) in reducing potential health risks linked to pesticide use in vegetables in the region."

Listening to the voice of the patient is often advocated in the pain literature. However, the patient's option is rarely asked for or considered by clinicians, even when they live with a condition that health professionals have rarely heard of.To explore what people living with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) think health professionals should know about their condition to provide appropriate care.A heuristic, hermeneutic phenomenological study was conducted asking people about their experiences living with CRPS. This paper reports on the findings of an additional question asked of all participants.Seventeen people living with complex regional pain syndrome were interviewed.Overwhelmingly, participants felt that health professionals do not know enough about CRPS, or chronic pain and believe their health outcomes are affected by this lack of knowledge. Sub-themes identified were don't touch unless I say it is okay; be patient with the patient/ it is important to develop a relationship; educate yourself and educate the patient; choose your words carefully and refer to others as needed. An additional theme, it is very hard to describe CRPS was also identified.Including patients as a member of the healthcare team is recommended to help people take control and self-manage their pain. For true patient centered care to be achieved, health professionals must accept and respect patients' descriptions of pain and their pain experience. This may require additional health professional education at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels in pain and communication to increase their bedside manner and therapeutic communication to deliver care in partnership with the patient."

In order to realize the high-precision prediction of ETO in the absence of meteorological data, this study use XGBoost to select key influencing factors and BP algorithm to construct ETO prediction model of 12 meteorological stations in South West China in this study. ACO, CSO and CS algorithms are used to optimize the model and improve the adaptability of the model. The results show that Tmax, n and Ra can be used as the input combination of ETO model construction, and Tmax is the primary factor affecting ETO. ETO model constructed by BP algorithm has good goodness of fit with the ETO calculated by FAO-56 PM and ACO, CSO and CS have significant optimization effect on BP algorithm, among which CSO algorithm has the best optimization ability on BP, with RMSE, R2, MAE, NSE, GPI ranging 0.200-0.377, 0.932-0.984, 0.140-0.261, 0.920-0.984, 1.472-2.000, GPI ranking is 1-23. Therefore, the input combination (Tmax, n and Ra) and CSO-BP model are recommended as a simplified model for ETO prediction in Southwest China."
https://openalex.org/W4282843232,"In recent decades, experimental data has accumulated indicating that short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) can play a significant functional role in the regulation of gene expression in the host genome. In addition, molecular markers based on SINE insertion polymorphisms have been developed and are widely used for genetic differentiation of populations of eukaryotic organisms. Using routine bioinformatics analysis and publicly available genomic DNA and small RNA-seq data, we first described nine SINEs in the genome of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica. All described SINEs have tRNA promoters, and the start of their transcription begins 11 bp upstream of an ""A"" box of these promoters. The number of copies of the described SINEs in the B. germanica genome ranges from several copies to more than a thousand copies in a SINE-specific manner. Some of the described SINEs and their degenerate copies can be localized both in the introns of genes and loci known as piRNA clusters. piRNAs originating from piRNA clusters are shown to be mapped to seven of the nine types of SINEs described, including copies of SINEs localized in gene introns. We speculate that SINEs, localized in the introns of certain genes, may regulate the level of expression of these genes by a PIWI-related molecular mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4281606931,"The human parasite Trypanosoma brucei contains a motile flagellum that determines the plane of cell division, controls cell morphology, and mediates cell-cell communication. During the cell cycle, inheritance of the newly formed flagellum requires its correct positioning toward the posterior of the cell, which depends on the faithful segregation of multiple flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures including the basal body, the flagellar pocket collar, the flagellum attachment zone, and the hook complex. A specialized group of four microtubules termed the microtubule quartet (MtQ) originates from the basal body and runs through the flagellar pocket collar and the hook complex to extend, along the flagellum attachment zone, toward the anterior of the cell. However, the physiological function of the MtQ is poorly understood, and few MtQ-associated proteins have been identified and functionally characterized. We report here that an MtQ-localized protein named NHL1 interacts with the microtubule-binding protein TbSpef1 and depends on TbSpef1 for its localization to the MtQ. We show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of NHL1 impairs the segregation of flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures, resulting in mispositioning of the new flagellum. Furthermore, knockdown of NHL1 also causes misplacement of the cell division plane in dividing trypanosome cells, halts cleavage furrow ingression, and inhibits completion of cytokinesis. These findings uncover a crucial role for the MtQ-associated protein NHL1 in regulating basal body segregation to promote flagellar inheritance in T. brucei."
https://openalex.org/W4282823478,"HIV infections disproportionately impact Latino gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the United States. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a proven prevention strategy that can help reduce new HIV infections in this population. Unfortunately, PrEP adoption and persistence among Latino GBM remain low. The added benefits of using PrEP experienced by Latino GBM can provide important insights to inform the development of PrEP messaging to motivate this population to explore and consider PrEP as an appropriate and acceptable HIV prevention tool.We conducted in-depth interviews with Latino GBM PrEP users to explore positive feelings and emotions, and additional benefits gained from using PrEP. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.A total of 29 Latino GBM completed the study interview. The average age of participants was 30 years, and the mean length of time using PrEP was 17.1 months. Five themes were constructed from the data representing the additional benefits gained by Latino GBM PrEP users, and included: (1) reduced fear, anxiety, and stress about HIV, HIV testing, and sex; (2) feeling empowered and in control of their HIV risk; (3) greater awareness of sexual risk behaviors and sexual health; (4) greater sexual exploration and pleasure, and comfort having condomless sex; and (5) a greater connection to community and a feeling of contributing to the elimination of HIV.The added benefits identified in this study represent a range of social, emotional, and psychological benefits that Latino GBM experience while using PrEP. They speak to the complementary benefits that PrEP can bring to Latino GBM who decide to use the medication, that go beyond HIV prevention. These findings can inform the development of future PrEP messaging to help improve motivation for PrEP uptake and persistent use among Latino GBM."
https://openalex.org/W4282836506,"The publishing industry shows marked evidence of both gender and racial discrimination. A rational explanation for this difference in treatment of both female and Black authors might relate to the taste-based preferences of book consumers, who might be less willing to pay for books by such authors. We ran a randomized experiment to test for the presence of discriminatory preferences by consumers based on authors' race, gender and/or age. We collected ratings of 25,201 book surveys across 9,072 subjects on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, making this study the largest experimental study of the book market to date. Subjects were presented with mocked-up book covers and descriptions from each of 14 fiction and non-fiction genres, with one of three possible titles per book randomly assigned. Using author names and photographs, we signaled authors' race, gender, and age and randomly assigned these combinations to each book presented to our subjects. We then asked subjects to rate their interest in purchasing the book, their evaluation of the author's credentials, and the amount they were willing to pay for the book. The experimental design of this study strived to eliminate the potential for proxy-based discrimination by providing book descriptions that detailed the authors' relevant professional experience. The large sample allowed for exploration of various types of taste-based discrimination observed in the literature, including discrimination against particular groups, homophily, and pro-social behavior. Overall, book consumers showed a willingness to pay approximately $0.50 or 3.5% more on average for books by Black authors and little, if any, practically meaningful discrimination based on age or gender. In other words, our study finds no and even contrary evidence of taste-based preferences by consumers that would rationalize the historic discriminatory treatment of Black or of female authors by publishers nor of discrimination based on an author's age."
https://openalex.org/W4282842544,"Using polynomial distributed lag (PDL) models, the impacts of macroeconomic factors relating to economic, financial, and sociological stress and designed to be short-run predictors of U.S. economic performance are identified and assessed concerning participation in key food assistance programs (SNAP, WIC, and NSLP). The econometric analysis covers the period October 1999 to September 2020. The impact of COVID-19 on participation in these programs also is quantified. Based on the parameter estimates obtained from the econometric PDL models, ex-ante forecasts of participation in the SNAP, WIC, and NSLP subsequently are made and evaluated over the period October 2020 to August 2021. The empirical results show that different sets of macroeconomic drivers affect participation levels across the respective food assistance programs. No macroeconomic factor is common across SNAP, WIC, and NSLP participation. Changes in macroeconomic conditions which influence SNAP, WIC and NSLP participation are not just contemporaneous but also affect participation levels anywhere from 1 month to 12 months later. Importantly, this research allows not only the determination of the macroeconomic factors which affect program participation but also allows the determination of the ability of the respective models to forecast program participation. As such, the Food and Nutrition Service will be in better position to assess program needs as well as to forecast program participation levels to minimize errors in the budgetary process."
https://openalex.org/W4282843097,"Endometriosis affects reproductive-aged females and varies considerably in terms of symptom presentation, morphologic features, and treatment response. Most studies investigating symptom recurrence after an endometriosis-related surgery have been conducted among adults. The Endometriosis pain QUality aftEr Surgical Treatment (EndoQUEST) Study was established to assess characteristics and biomarkers that are associated with pain remediation and improved quality of life after an endometriosis-related surgery among adolescents and young adults. This paper describes the EndoQUEST methodology, summarizes baseline descriptive factors, and compares characteristics by participant retention status. We enrolled 100 surgically-confirmed endometriosis participants aged 12-23 years who provided questionnaire data on reproductive and behavioral factors, pain characteristics and quality of life at three time points; before surgery, 6 weeks to 26 weeks after surgery, and 1 year after surgery. Among these 100 participants, 88 provided blood and/or saliva at all three time points, while 12 provided blood and/or saliva samples only before surgery and 6 to 26 weeks after surgery. There was little evidence of lost to follow-up at 1 year after surgery due to pain symptoms, as pain and quality of life characteristics were similar between participants who completed the questionnaire 1 year after surgery and those who did not. Analyses utilizing these longitudinal data will advance personalized treatment decision making for adolescents and young adults with endometriosis."
https://openalex.org/W4282843773,"Our recent studies identifying factors significantly associated with the positive child health index (PCHI) in a mixed cohort of preterm-born singletons, twins, and triplets posed some analytic and modeling challenges. The PCHI transforms the total number of health disorders experienced (of the eleven ascertained) to a scale from 0 to 100%. While some of the children had none of the eleven health disorders (i.e., PCHI = 1), others experienced a subset or all (i.e., 0 ≤PCHI< 1). This indicates the existence of two distinct data processes-one for the healthy children, and another for those with at least one health disorder, necessitating a two-part model to accommodate both. Further, the scores for twins and triplets are potentially correlated since these children share similar genetics and early environments. The existing approach for analyzing PCHI data dichotomizes the data (i.e., number of health disorders) and uses a mixed-effects logistic or multiple logistic regression to model the binary feature of the PCHI (1 vs. < 1). To provide an alternate analytic framework, in this study we jointly model the two data processes under a mixed-effects two-part model framework that accounts for the sample correlations between and within the two data processes. The proposed method increases power to detect factors associated with disorders. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed joint-test procedure consistently outperforms the existing method when the type I error is controlled at the same level. Our numerical studies also show that the proposed method is robust to model misspecifications and it is applicable to a set of correlated semi-continuous data."
