https://openalex.org/W2007414406,"Temporal difference learning has been proposed as a model for Pavlovian conditioning, in which an animal learns to predict delivery of reward following presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS). A key component of this model is a prediction error signal, which, before learning, responds at the time of presentation of reward but, after learning, shifts its response to the time of onset of the CS. In order to test for regions manifesting this signal profile, subjects were scanned using event-related fMRI while undergoing appetitive conditioning with a pleasant taste reward. Regression analyses revealed that responses in ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex were significantly correlated with this error signal, suggesting that, during appetitive conditioning, computations described by temporal difference learning are expressed in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2157535220,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of aggregates (Lewy bodies) in neurons. α-Synuclein is the major protein in Lewy bodies and rare mutations in α-synuclein cause early-onset PD. Consequently, α-synuclein is implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Here, we have investigated the degradation pathways of α-synuclein, using a stable inducible PC12 cell model, where the expression of exogenous human wild-type, A30P, or A53T α-synuclein can be switched on and off. We have used a panel of inhibitors/stimulators of autophagy and proteasome function and followed α-synuclein degradation in these cells. We found that not only is α-synuclein degraded by the proteasome, but it is also degraded by autophagy. A role for autophagy was further supported by the presence of α-synuclein in organelles with the ultrastructural features of autophagic vesicles. Since rapamycin, a stimulator of autophagy, increased clearance of α-synuclein, it merits consideration as a potential therapeutic for Parkinsons disease, as it is designed for chronic use in humans.

Parkinson's disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; HA, hemagglutinin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; baf A1, bafilomycin A1. is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The pathogenic hallmark of PD is the accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein in susceptible neurons. The cytoplasmic aggregates/inclusions characteristic of PD are called Lewy bodies and their major constituent is α-synuclein (1Kahle P.J. Haass C. Kretzschmer H.A. Neumann M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 449-457Google Scholar). Lewy pathology is also found in dementia with Lewy bodies, the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease, in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type I and in glial cytoplasmic inclusions of multiple system atrophy. These diseases are collectively known as “α-synucleinopathies” (2Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Google Scholar, 3Mezey E. Dehejia A.M. Harta G. Suchy S.F. Nussbaum R.L. Brownstein M.J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Mol. Psychiatry. 1998; 3: 493-499Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is likely to play a role in PD, since two missense mutations in α-synuclein (A53T and A30P) cause autosomal dominant, early-onset PD (4Polymeropoulos M.H.

Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Google Scholar), and animal models overexpressing α-synuclein develop a disease phenotype with Lewy body-like pathology and locomotor impairment (6Feany M.B.

Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Google Scholar). However, while α-synuclein knock-out mice show some disruption in synaptic neurotransmission, they do not manifest obvious disease and develop normally, with a normal life span and behavior (8Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H. Castillo P.E. Shinsky N. Verdugo J.M. Armanini M. Ryan A. Hynes M. Phillips H. Sulzer D. Rosenthal A.

McIlwain K.L. Orrison B. Chen A. Ellis C.E. Paylor R. Lu B. Nussbaum R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8797-8807Google Scholar). Two other forms of inherited PD are caused by mutations in Parkin (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) (11Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Google Scholar) and ubiquitin carboxyL-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) (12Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J. Jonnalagada S. Chernova T. Dehejia A. Lavedon C. Gasser T. Steinbach P.J. Wilkinson K.D. Polymeropoulos M.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 451-452Google Scholar). Both of these proteins are involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of intracellular proteins (13Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Google Scholar). This evidence and the identification of proteasome subunits in Lewy bodies (14Ii K. Ito H. Tanaka K. Hirano A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 125-131Google Scholar) has led to the speculation that an impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system may contribute to the progression of PD. A number of studies have investigated the effect of proteasomal inhibition on α-synuclein metabolism, with conflicting results. Some groups reported that proteasomal inhibition caused an accumulation of α-synuclein, inclusion formation and increased cell death (15Bennett M.C. Bishop J.F. Leng Y. Chock P.B. Chase T.N. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33855-33858Google Scholar, 16McNaught K.St.P. Mytilineou C. JnoBaptiste R. Yabut J. Shashidharan P. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 301-306Google Scholar, 17Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Google Scholar), while other studies suggested α-synuclein is not a proteasome substrate (18Rideout H.J. Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Stefanis L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 899-908Google Scholar, 19Ancolio K. Alves da Costa C. Ueda K. Checler F. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 285: 79-82Google Scholar). Another pathway that may be relevant to α-synuclein clearance is autophagy, a process mediating bulk degradation of cytoplasmic proteins or organelles in the lytic compartment. Autophagy involves the formation of double-membrane structures called autophagosomes, which fuse with primary lysosomes to become an autophagolysosome where their content is degraded and then either disposed of or recycled back to the cell (20Klionsky D.J. Oshumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Google Scholar). We have recently shown that aggregate-prone proteins with polyglutamine and polyalanine expansions are degraded by autophagy (21Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Google Scholar). Since α-synuclein is also an aggregate-prone protein, we have tested whether it is degraded by this pathway. Our previous data suggested that aggregate-prone proteins were more likely to be cleared by autophagy than the more soluble species that did not have expanded polyglutamines or polyalanines. In the context of α-synuclein, this model predicts that the A53T mutation that forms aggregates most readily may be more dependent on autophagy than the wild-type protein or A30P mutation (that forms oligomers efficiently but not aggregates) (22Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Google Scholar). In this study, we have used PC12 cells to establish stable, doxycycline-inducible lines as they are dopaminergic and can be differentiated into a neuron-like phenotype with nerve growth factor (23Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Google Scholar). We used the Tet-On system, where regulation of expression is achieved through a tetracycline-controlled transactivator. This allows us to turn on and off α-synuclein expression by adding and then removing doxycycline and therefore enables us to follow α-synuclein clearance. In our cell lines we found that α-synuclein was degraded by both proteasome and autophagy pathways. Establishment of Inducible PC12 Cell Lines—Human α-synuclein with a HA tag at the NH2 terminus and a His6 tag at the COOH terminus was amplified from pHM6α-synuclein constructs (24Furlong R.A. Narain Y. Rankin J. Wyttenbach A. Rubinsztein D.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 577-581Google Scholar) and inserted into pTRE2hyg vector (Clontech) using NheI/SalI sites. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing before use. The pTRE2hygα-synuclein construct and pTet-tTS (Clontech) were co-transfected into PC12 Tet-On cells (Clontech), using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Single colonies were isolated using cloning cylinders (Sigma), and cells were grown and tested for α-synuclein expression upon induction. Cell lines were subjected to a further round of purification from single colonies to ensure that lines were pure. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Sigma), 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and 149 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) at 37 °C, 10%CO2. To induce differentiation, cells were grown in media containing 1% horse serum and 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (2.5 S, Upstate Biotechnology) and incubated for about 5 days. Cells were induced to express synuclein with 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma). Immunofluorescence—Coverslips were placed in six-well dishes and coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells were seeded and induced with 2 μg/ml doxycycline and incubated as necessary. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min and then washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 (Sigma) for 15 min. Cells were blocked in 10% fetal calf serum for at least 30 min. Anti-α-synuclein monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) was used at 1:200 for 2–16 h, cells were washed and 1:200 Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added for 1 h. This anti-α-synuclein antibody could detect both human and rat α-synuclein; therefore, uninduced controls were performed in parallel to compare endogenous α-synuclein levels. Staining was always considerably fainter in the uninduced controls. For double staining with LysoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) cells were incubated in Earle's balanced salts solution (Sigma) with 75 nm LysoTracker for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed and stained with anti-α-synuclein antibody and 1:200 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as secondary antibody. Slides were mounted in Citifluor (Citifluor Ltd.) with 3 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Treatment with Autophagy/Proteasome Drugs—Cells were induced for 24 h and then washed twice with medium to remove doxycycline. Then cells were incubated in media containing either 10 mm 3-methyladenine (3-MA, Sigma), 200 nm bafilomycin A1 (Sigma), 0.2 mg/ml rapamycin (Sigma), 10 μm lactacystin (Sigma), 10 μm epoxomicin (Affinity Research Products Ltd.) or carrier controls (water or Me2SO (Sigma)). 3-MA and lactacystin were made up in water and rapamycin, epoxomicin, and bafilomycin were dissolved in Me2SO. After 24 h the medium was replaced with fresh medium plus drug, and after a further 24 h cell pellets were collected and stored at –80 °C until required. Western Blot Analysis—Cell pellets were collected and stored at –80 °C until needed. Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer: 1% Triton-X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Samples were then mixed with loading buffer: 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 700 mm β-mercaptoethanol and boiled before loading onto 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Each lane was loaded with protein from a similar number of cells, based on cell counting at the time of seeding. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). α-Synuclein was detected with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance) at 1:1000 dilution with 4–18 h incubation. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:2000 dilution was then added to blots, and antibody was detected using ECL blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped and then reprobed for α-tubulin (Sigma) at 1:1000 dilution. Immunogold Labeling for Electron Microscopy—Cells were induced with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h. The cells were fixed in situ with 2% formaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m PIPES buffer and harvested by scraping. The cells were incubated in 0.1 m PIPES buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 20% polypropylene glycol, concentrated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm in a Hermle Z 160 M centrifuge (Hermle Labortechnik), and the supernatant was removed. Small droplets (5 μl) of the cells were mounted onto aluminum foil and quench-frozen by plunging them into melting propane cooled in liquid nitrogen. After freezing, the cells were transferred into a Leica AFS freeze substitution unit in vials of frozen, dry methanol, containing 0.5% uranyl acetate. They were maintained at –90 °C for 24 h followed by 24 h at –70 °C and another 24 h at –50 °C. They were infiltrated with Lowicryl HM20 over 3 days and polymerized by irradiation with UV light for 48 h. Thin sections were cut using a Leica Ultracut S and mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids. The sections were incubated overnight in mouse anti-HA primary antibodies (Covance), diluted 1:5 in Tris-buffered saline at pH 7.4 containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Triton-X-100, 0.5% fetal calf serum, and 10% normal goat serum. The sections were washed six times in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (British Biocell), diluted 1:100 in the diluent for the primary antibody at pH 8.5 without added goat serum for 1 h (25Skepper J.N. J. Microscopy. 2000; 199: 1-36Google Scholar). They were rinsed six times in Tris-buffered saline and twice in deionized water and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before viewing in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. Establishment of Inducible α-Synuclein Cell Lines—We established stable, inducible lines for human wild-type, A30P, and A53T α-synuclein in PC12 (rat phaeochromocytoma) cells using the Tet-On system, where addition of doxycycline switches on transgene expression. We selected two different clonal lines for each form of α-synuclein, on the basis of low background transgene expression and high inducibility and tested these independent lines in all our experiments. We initially looked at α-synuclein localization in our induced cells. We found that α-synuclein was evenly distributed across the cells, often with a vesicular pattern of staining (Fig. 1A). The diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of α-synuclein was similar to previous observation with this protein in PC12 cells (18Rideout H.J. Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Stefanis L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 899-908Google Scholar). The image shown is representative of α-synuclein localization in all our cell lines expressing wild-type, A30P, and A53T with either mitotic or differentiated cells, induced for 2, 6, or 10 days. At the light microscope level, it was unclear whether the vesicular structures were aggregates. We did not see very large aggregates characteristic of polyglutamine and polyalanine expansions (e.g. Ref. 26Narain Y. Wyttenbach A. Rankin J. Furlong R.A. Rubinsztein D.C. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 739-746Google Scholar) for either wild-type, A30P, or A53T, even after expression of α-synuclein for 10 days. The staining for α-synuclein in uninduced cells was below the level of detection when analyzed with confocal microscopy using the same settings that gave clear signals for induced cells (Fig. 1B). However, α-synuclein immunoreactivity in the uninduced cells was observed when the gain was increased; this staining is likely to reflect predominantly endogenous α-synuclein in the cells, since there is minimal leakiness of transgene expression in uninduced cells (Fig. 2). We also examined cell death by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and inspection of nuclear morphology after DAPI staining. We did not find a significant change in numbers of dead cells after induction of α-synuclein expression in any of the lines expressing wild-type, A30P, or A53T (data not shown). In both cycling and differentiated cells, cell death was <10% at all times studied up to 10 days of induction (assessment by DAPI staining for wild-type, A30P, or A53T).Fig. 2Degradation of α-synuclein after expression is switched off in the inducible cell lines. Western blot analysis of total exogenous human α-synuclein in the inducible PC12 cell lines. Cells were left uninduced (U) or induced with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h (I) or induced for 24 h and then washed to remove doxycycline and left for a further 72 h (OFF) in medium. The top panels show the α-synuclein band detected with an anti-HA antibody, and the bottom panels show α-tubulin as a loading control. Note that where the uninduced and induced lanes appear as separate gel “strips,” these were derived from non-adjacent lanes from the same exposure of blots from single gels where lysates from uninduced and induced cells were loaded; intervening lanes were excised to simplify presentation. WT, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this study, we have assayed α-synuclein levels by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody to enable specific detection of the transgene products. All blots in this paper are representative and were performed at least twice with each clonal cell line. We used our cell model to switch on expression of α-synuclein with doxycycline and then switch off expression by removing doxycycline from the medium, to follow α-synuclein degradation. Significantly lower levels of α-synuclein were observed 72 h after expression was switched off, compared with the time point at which doxycycline was removed (Fig. 2). α-Synuclein Is Degraded by the Proteasome in Our Cell Model—We switched on α-synuclein expression for 24 h, then removed doxycycline and added the proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin or lactacystin for 48 h. We consistently saw an increase in α-synuclein levels with treatment with the proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin or lactacystin, in both cycling and differentiated cells in all cell lines (Fig. 3). We used both inhibitors as recent reports have shown that lactacystin also inhibits cathepsin A activity of the lysosome and thus may not be proteasome-specific (27Ostrowska H. Wojcik C. Wilk S. Omura S. Kozlowski L. Stoklosa T. Worowski K. Radziwon P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 747-757Google Scholar, 28Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsasser H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14Google Scholar). Addition of these drugs did not cause increased cell death or overt aggregate formation. α-Synuclein Is Degraded by Autophagy—We then tested whether α-synuclein is also degraded by autophagy using a panel of inhibitors/activators, a strategy we have used previously in the context of polyglutamine/polyalanine expansions. 3-MA is a specific inhibitor of autophagy (20Klionsky D.J. Oshumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Google Scholar) inhibiting autophagy at the sequestration stage, where a double membrane structure forms around a portion of the cytosol. Bafilomycin A1 (baf A1) is a vacuolar ATPase inhibitor that interferes with the autophagosome-lysosome fusion step (29Yamamoto A. Tagawa Y. Yoshimori T. Moriyama Y. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 33-42Google Scholar), and rapamycin is an antifungal macrolide antibiotic that stimulates autophagy. To test the role of autophagy on α-synuclein clearance in our cell lines, they were induced for 24 h, then doxycycline was removed and the drugs were added for 48 h. The trends we observed were similar in cells treated with drugs for 24 and 72 h (data not shown). Inhibiting autophagy with 3-MA and baf A1 led to an obvious increase of α-synuclein levels in the A53T lines (Fig. 4). These inhibitors only induced slight changes, at best, in α-synuclein levels in mitotic wild-type and A30P lines (e.g. 3-MA with wild-type). Rapamycin, which stimulates autophagy, increased clearance of wild-type, A30P, and A53T α-synuclein in mitotic cells (Fig. 4A). In differentiated cells, the A53T lines again showed greater susceptibility to accumulating α-synuclein after treatment with 3-MA and baf A1. Since the effects of these inhibitors on the wild-type and A30P lines were small, these experiments were repeated to allow us to do statistics. We compared the densitometry values of α-synuclein bands (as a function of tubulin) for 3-MA and baf A1 treatments to those for control cells and calculated the fold increase in α-synuclein levels in the cells after drug treatment. Both inhibitors had significant effects on A30P accumulation (A30P + 3-MA, 1.13-fold increase (±0.04 S.E.); p = 0.04 (n = 4 experiments; paired t tests in all cases); A30P + baf A1, 1.19-fold increase (± 0.015 S.E.); p = 0.006 (n = 3)). While the trend for wild-type α-synuclein suggests that these inhibitors were impairing its degradation, the data did not reach significance (wild-type + 3-MA, 1.48-fold increase (±0.36 S.E.); p = 0.26 (n = 5); wild-type + baf A1, 1.12-fold increase (±0.08 S.E.); p = 0.23 (n = 4)). When we stimulated autophagy in differentiated cells by adding rapamycin, we saw increased clearance of wild-type, A30P, and A53T α-synuclein (Fig. 4B). α-Synuclein Is Seen in Vesicles with Autophagic Morphology—We examined the subcellular localization of α-synuclein in our cell lines using immunogold electron microscopy. We used an antibody to the HA-tag on the α-synuclein transgene products to detect α-synuclein (Fig. 5). Gold labeling for α-synuclein was apparent over vesicles with autophagic morphology. A degree of caution is required in interpreting these data, since there are no available antibodies to allow specific labeling of mammalian autophagosomes or autolysosomes in general or in PC12 cells. Nevertheless, the vesicles we observed had morphologies consistent with those described in previous studies of autophagy (30Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-667Google Scholar), Huntington's disease (31Kegel K.B. Kim M. Sapp E. McIntyre C. Castaño J.G. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7268-7278Google Scholar), and α-synuclein (32Stefanis L. Larsen K.E. Rideout H.J. Sulzer D. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9549-9560Google Scholar). (In these studies, vesicles were identified as autophagic on similar morphologic grounds in the absence of specific antibodies.) α-Synuclein was observed either “free” or associated with electron dense bodies of around 100 nm in diameter. There were often two or more gold particles over these bodies, which could indicate α-synuclein microaggregates. Such bodies were also seen in the cytoplasm, sometimes associated with α-synuclein. It is possible that these electron dense bodies may be dense core granules transporting neurotransmitters. Confocal immunofluorescence studies showed that α-synuclein (wild-type, A30P, and A53T) was localized inside acidic vacuoles labeled using LysoTracker Red (Fig. 6). LysoTracker Red labels acid compartments including degradative autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes. Note that α-synuclein was not excluded from these compartments, and speckles of α-synuclein immunoreactivity are clearly visible within these vacuoles. These data support our inhibitor/rapamycin studies that implicate a role for the autophagylysosome pathway for α-synuclein degradation. We have shown that α-synuclein is degraded by both the proteasome and autophagy in our inducible PC12 cell lines. Our Western blotting data implicating autophagy as a clearance route for this protein are supported by observations of wild-type, A53T, and A30P species in autophagic vesicles by electron microscopy. This is the first report that implicates autophagy as well as the proteasome as a route for α-synuclein degradation. Perturbations of autophagy had a more marked effect on the degradation of A53T α-synuclein, which may be due to its greater propensity to aggregate, compared with wild-type and A30P (22Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Google Scholar). This would be consistent with the recent report of Verhoef et al. (33Verhoef L.G. Lindsten K. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2689-2700Google Scholar), suggesting that soluble, but not aggregated, polyglutamine expansions could be degraded by the proteasome. This is probably because aggregated proteins cannot enter the entrance to the proteasome barrel. If this is the case, then perhaps all aggregated proteins will be preferentially routed to the autophagy-lysosome pathway for degradation. A model where soluble α-synuclein is cleared by the proteasome but aggregated α-synuclein is preferentially cleared by autophagy may partially account for the conflicting previous data regarding its metabolism by the proteasome (15Bennett M.C.

Lett. 2000; 285: 79-82Google Scholar). α-Synuclein expression and aggregation is likely to vary between different cell types, under different transfection conditions and with different promoters etc., and this may explain the apparent discrepancies (15Bennett M.C. Bishop J.F. Leng Y. Chock P.B. Chase T.N. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33855-33858Google Scholar, 16McNaught K.St.P. Mytilineou C. JnoBaptiste R. Yabut J. Shashidharan P. Jenner P.

Indeed, recent studies do support a role for the clearance of forms of α-synuclein by the proteasome (34Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Google Scholar, 35Petrucelli L. O'Farrell C. Lockhart P.J. Baptista M. Kehoe K. Vink L. Choi P. Wolozin B. Farrer M. Hardy J. Cookson M.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1007-1019Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the dependence of wild-type and A30P α-synuclein on autophagy for degradation is less in cycling versus differentiated cells. One could speculate that this may be because the lack of cell division in the differentiated cells may enhance microaggregate formation. An interesting feature of our data is that proteasome inhibitors were more efficient than autophagy inhibitors in stabilizing α-synuclein. For instance, in Fig. 4A, bafilomycin A1 has almost no effect, yet rapamycin induces very efficient clearance of α-synuclein. This may be compatible with increased partitioning of the α-synuclein pool into an autophagy pathway that may be up-regulated by the overexpression of this protein (32Stefanis L. Larsen K.E. Rideout H.J. Sulzer D. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9549-9560Google Scholar). Neither rapamycin nor autophagy inhibitors, like 3-MA, modulate the clearance of prototypical proteasomal substrates, like transcriptional activators (36Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Google Scholar) or misfolded intracellular cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (37Gelman M.S. Kannegaard E.S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11709-11714Google Scholar). However, alternative explanations for the lower efficacy of autophagy inhibitors compared with proteasome inhibitors on α-synuclein clearance may be that the autophagy inhibitors are less effective or that the half-life of total intracellular α-synuclein clearance through the proteasome is shorter than through the autophagy route. Indeed, this latter possibility would be compatible with the idea that aggregated α-synuclein is cleared mainly by autophagy, while soluble forms may be efficiently degraded by the proteasome. We have shown that the autophagy inducer rapamycin increases clearance of all forms of α-synuclein. This may have therapeutic potential for treatment of Parkinson's disease as rapamycin is intended for long term use in patients. A strategy aimed at down-regulating steady-state levels of α-synuclein in humans may be feasible as a means of preventing PD, especially if humans tolerate reductions/absence of this protein as well as mice."
https://openalex.org/W2157088567,"Functional MRI experiments in human subjects strongly suggest that the striatum participates in processing information about the predictability of rewarding stimuli. However, stimuli can be unpredictable in character (what stimulus arrives next), unpredictable in time (when the stimulus arrives), and unpredictable in amount (how much arrives). These variables have not been dissociated in previous imaging work in humans, thus conflating possible interpretations of the kinds of expectation errors driving the measured brain responses. Using a passive conditioning task and fMRI in human subjects, we show that positive and negative prediction errors in reward delivery time correlate with BOLD changes in human striatum, with the strongest activation lateralized to the left putamen. For the negative prediction error, the brain response was elicited by expectations only and not by stimuli presented directly; that is, we measured the brain response to nothing delivered (juice expected but not delivered) contrasted with nothing delivered (nothing expected)."
https://openalex.org/W2151428784,"Objects in our environment tend to be grouped in typical contexts. How does the human brain analyze such associations between visual objects and their specific context? We addressed this question in four functional neuroimaging experiments and revealed the cortical mechanisms that are uniquely activated when people recognize highly contextual objects (e.g., a traffic light). Our findings indicate that a region in the parahippocampal cortex and a region in the retrosplenial cortex together comprise a system that mediates both spatial and nonspatial contextual processing. Interestingly, each of these regions has been identified in the past with two functions: the processing of spatial information and episodic memory. Attributing contextual analysis to these two areas, instead, provides a framework for bridging between previous reports."
https://openalex.org/W2141614367,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) is mainly expressed in teeth by the odontoblasts and preameloblasts. The Dspp mRNA is translated into a single protein, Dspp, and cleaved into two peptides, dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein, that are localized within the dentin matrix. Recently, mutations in this gene were identified in human dentinogenesis imperfecta II (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) accession number 125490) and in dentin dysplasia II (OMIM accession number 125420) syndromes. Herein, we report the generation of Dspp-null mice that develop tooth defects similar to human dentinogenesis imperfecta III with enlarged pulp chambers, increased width of predentin zone, hypomineralization, and pulp exposure. Electron microscopy revealed an irregular mineralization front and a lack of calcospherites coalescence in the dentin. Interestingly, the levels of biglycan and decorin, small leucine-rich proteoglycans, were increased in the widened predentin zone and in void spaces among the calcospherites in the dentin of null teeth. These enhanced levels correlate well with the defective regions in mineralization and further indicate that these molecules may adversely affect the dentin mineralization process by interfering with coalescence of calcospherites. Overall, our results identify a crucial role for Dspp in orchestrating the events essential during dentin mineralization, including potential regulation of proteoglycan levels.

Overall, our results identify a crucial role for Dspp in orchestrating the events essential during dentin mineralization, including potential regulation of proteoglycan levels. Tooth development depends on reciprocal interactions between oral epithelium and mesenchyme (1Lumsden A.G. Development. 1988; 103: 155-169Google Scholar). The mesenchymederived odontoblasts secrete several collagenous and non-collagenous proteins to form a unique extracellular matrix (2MacDougall M. Zeichner-David M. Slavkin H.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 493-500Google Scholar). Among the non-collagenous proteins, dentin sialoprotein (Dsp) 1The abbreviations used are: Dsp, dentin sialoprotein; Dpp, dentin phosphoprotein; Dspp, dentin sialophosphoprotein; DGI, dentinogenesis imperfecta; ES, embryonic stem; GAG, glycosaminoglycans; RT, reverse transcription/transcriptase. and dentin phosphoprotein (Dpp) are highly tooth-specific and are believed to play a crucial role in converting predentin to form mineralized dentin. These two proteins are derived from the cleavage of a 940-amino acid polypeptide, dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp) (3MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Google Scholar). The Dspp gene consists of five exons spanning 16 kb and is transcribed as a 4.4-kb mRNA (4Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Google Scholar). mRNA for Dspp is expressed predominantly by odontoblasts and transiently by preameloblasts (5D'Souza R.N.

Recently, however, low levels of Dspp have been observed in the ear and in bone (8Xiao S. Yu C. Chou X. Yuan W. Wang Y. Bu L. Fu G. Qian M. Yang J. Shi Y. Hu L. Han B. Wang Z. Huang W. Liu J. Chen Z. Zhao G. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 201-204Google Scholar, 9Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cadena E. Ridall A. Tsujigiwa H. Nagatsuka H. Nagai N. Butler W.T. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 392-394Google Scholar). The Dsp, the amino-terminal part of Dspp, is a sialic acid-rich and glycosylated protein that shares similarities with the other sialoproteins, including bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein-1, and osteopontin. The Dpp, a highly phosphorylated protein with repeats of aspartic acid and phosphoserine, is thought to play a key role in the nucleation of hydroxyapatite formation during dentin calcification (10Veis A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: S493-S497Google Scholar, 11George A. Bannon L. Sabsay B. Dillon J.W. Malone J. Veis A. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32869-32873Google Scholar, 12Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 204-210Google Scholar). Because of its restricted expression and its physical localization on the human chromosome 4q within the dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI)-II locus (13Aplin H.M. Hirst K.L. Crosby A.H. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 30: 347-349Google Scholar, 14MacDougall M. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 227-233Google Scholar), Dspp was implicated as a potential candidate gene for this disorder. The other important genes involved in biomineralization mapped to this region of chromosome 4q include dentin matrix protein-1, bone sialoprotein, and osteopontin. DGI, an autosomal dominant disorder of the tooth that primarily affects dentin biomineralization, is classified into three subtypes, based on the clinical features; type I is the least severe and type III is the most severe (15Shields E.D. Bixler D. el-Kafrawy A.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1973; 18: 543-553Google Scholar). DGI-I is associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, whereas the more severe forms (DGI-II and DGI-III) are restricted to the dentin. Opalescent dentin with obliterated pulp chambers are the characteristic features in DGI-II (16Rao S. Witkop Jr., C.J. Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 1971; 7: 153-184Google Scholar). The teeth of patients with DGI-III are referred to as ‘shell teeth,‘ in which the dentin mineralization does not occur after mantle dentin is formed. Radiographically, the pulp cavities in these teeth appear as enlarged pulp chambers along with high incidence of pulp exposures (17Witkop Jr., C.J. MacLean C.J. Schmidt P.J. Henry J.L. Ala. J. Med. Sci. 1966; 3: 382-403Google Scholar, 18Levin L.S. Leaf S.H. Jelmini R.J. Rose J.J. Rosenbaum K.N. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. 1983; 56: 267-274Google Scholar). Recently, several mutations in the Dspp gene have been identified in families with DGI-II disorder. These mutations include a C to T transition at the end of the third exon (Gln45stop) resulting in a premature termination of Dspp protein (19Zhang X. Zhao J. Li C. Gao S. Qiu C. Liu P. Wu G. Qiang B. Lo W.H. Shen Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 151-152Google Scholar), a G to A transition mutation in intron 3 (splice donor site) causing exon skipping, and Pro17Thr and Val18Phe transitions (8Xiao S. Yu C. Chou X. Yuan W. Wang Y. Bu L. Fu G. Qian M. Yang J. Shi Y. Hu L. Han B. Wang Z. Huang W. Liu J. Chen Z. Zhao G. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 201-204Google Scholar). Dentin dysplasia-II, another human disorder of dentin mineralization, is similar to DGI-II and is attributed to a Tyr6Asp protein transition mutation in the hydrophobic core sequence of the Dspp gene. This mutation disabled the entry of Dspp into the endoplasmic reticulum (20Rajpar M.H. Koch M.J. Davies R.M. Mellody K.T. Kielty C.M. Dixon M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2559-2565Google Scholar). All these mutations indicate a potential function for Dspp in tooth mineralization. To characterize the molecular events that control dentin mineralization during normal tooth development and disease, we have deleted the entire Dspp coding region in embryonic stem (ES) cells and generated Dspp–/– mice. These null mice displayed an enlarged pulp cavity, widened predentin zone, decreased dentin width, and high incidence of pulp exposures similar to that in DGI-III. In addition, these mice showed an increased accumulation of biglycan and decorin within the widened predentin and scalloped (void spaces) regions in the dentin, correlating well with defective mineralization. Generation of Dspp–/– Mice—Dspp genomic clones from a 129/SvJ mouse genomic library were cloned and characterized as reported previously (4Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Google Scholar). The targeting vector was constructed by standard recombinant DNA techniques; the Nsi/EcoRV region of exons 2–5 spanning the entire coding region of Dspp was replaced by a promoterless β-galactosidase gene with simian virus 40 polyadenylation sequences (21Sreenath T.L. Cho A. MacDougall M. Kulkarni A.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 509-516Google Scholar) followed by a neomycin-resistance and thymidylate kinase cassettes. The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and electroporated into 129/SvJ R1 embryonic stem cells. ES-cell clones that survived G-418 and ganciclovir selection were evaluated for homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis. ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and the chimeric mice produced were mated to C57Bl/6 female mice to derive heterozygotes. Heterozygous mice were then interbred to obtain homozygous mice and maintained as homozygotes. The null mice were viable and able to reproduce normally. All mice were housed according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. In Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were generated from Dspp exons 3 and 4 (pSX1.7) and hybridized to the frozen tissue sections obtained from 6-day-old mouse teeth as described previously (22Thyagarajan T. Sreenath T. Cho A. Wright J.T. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11016-11020Google Scholar). Microradiography—Wild-type and Dspp–/– mice were sacrificed, and the mandibles were separated and radiographed using a Faxitron MX20 Specimen Radiography System (Faxitron X-ray Corp., Wheeling, IL) at energy settings 120 s at 15 kV (22Thyagarajan T. Sreenath T. Cho A. Wright J.T. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11016-11020Google Scholar). The images were captured on X-OMAT TL film (Eastman Kodak). Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy—The jaws were dissected from the control and mutant mice and immersed in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde buffered solution, pH 7.4, for 12 h. The jaws are then transferred to a 0.1 m cacodylate buffer solution, pH 7.4. The teeth were dissected from the jaws using a dissecting microscope and prepared for analysis using the following techniques. Teeth were fractured and the samples mounted with the fractured surface facing, coated with Au-Pd using a sputter coater, and examined in a JEOL 6300 scanning electron microscope. After fixation, whole mandibles were glued to a glass slide and polished to an optically flat surface (1/4 μm) using an automatic polisher. The jaws were removed from the glass slide using acetone and rinsed with ethanol and dH2O, air dried, mounted on a carbon stub, and carbon coated. The samples were examined using a JEOL 6300 scanning electron microscope fitted with a backscatter detector (25-mm working distance, 15 kV). Small pieces of the incisors and molars were dissected from the teeth and osmicated before serial dehydration in ethanol. After dehydration, the samples were embedded in epoxy and then sectioned with an ultramicrotome. Sections were floated onto Formvar grids and stained with uranyl citrate and lead acetate. The samples were examined with a Phillips CM12 transmission electron microscope. Histology and Mineral Staining—The skulls from euthanized wild-type and Dspp–/– mice were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed skulls were processed, embedded in methyl methacrylate for 150-μm sections using an ISOMET low speed saw (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL), and stained for calcium by von Kossa's method. For general histology and for immunohistochemical analysis, mandibles were dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified in 0.1 m EDTA-sodium phosphate buffer for 3 weeks, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin wax. Glycosaminoglycans Staining—Frozen frontal sections (6 μm) from 6 day-old wild-type and Dspp–/– mouse heads were cut and treated with 100 μl of 0.1 units/ml chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4; Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA) for 2 h at 37 °C to digest the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Digested and undigested tooth sections were stained for the presence of sulfated GAGs with Alcian blue reagent containing 0.5 m magnesium chloride at pH 0.5 according to the method of Smith et al. (23Smith G. Smith A.J. Browne R.M. J. Oral Pathol. 1988; 17: 55-59Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Incisors from adult wild-type and mutant mice were dissected out and split sagittally into two halves using a stainless steel mini-scalpel (Cincinnati Surgicals, Cincinnati, OH) and pulp was dissociated overnight at 37 °C with collagenase (Worthington) (5 mg/ml in F16 media supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum). The teeth were washed several times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline to remove all the pulp cells. RNA was extracted by lysing the odontoblasts that were trapped in the dentin using a Micro RNA Isolation kit (Stratagene). RT-PCR was performed using Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the following primers: dspp (forward (F)), 5′-GGC ATA ATC AAA ACA CCG CTG C-3′; (reverse (R)), 5′-GGG GAA ATA GGG AAA TGA CAA AGG-3′; coll-I (F), 5′-ACC ATC TGG CAT CTC ATG GC-3′; (R), 5′-GCA ACA CAA TTG CAC CTG AGG-3′; biglycan (F), 5′-ACC TGT CCC CTT CCA TCT T-3′; (R), 5′-CCG TGT GTG TGT GTG TGT GT-3′; decorin (F), 5′-CCA ACA TAA CTG CGA TCC CT-3′; (R), 5′-TGT CCA AGT GGA GTT CCC TC-3′; mmp-3 (F), 5′-AGT GGA TCT TCG CAG TTG GAA TTT GAC-3′; (R), 5′-GTG TAA GCT ACA CAG TGC TTC TGA AC-3′; β-actin (F), 5′-GTG GGC CGC TCT AGG CAC CA-3′; (R), 5′-CGG TTG GCC TTA GGG TTC AGG GGG-3′; and gapdh (F), 5′-CCA TCA CCA TCT TCC AGG AG-3′; (R), 5′-GCA TGG ACT GTG GTC ATG AG-3′. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. Immunohistochemistry—Immunodetection of Dspp, biglycan, and decorin was performed on 5-μm thick paraffin sections. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a descending ethanol series. For biglycan and decorin immunostaining, the sections were treated with 100 μl of 0.1 units/ml chondroitinase ABC for 2 h at 37 °C to digest the GAGs before antibody addition. The tissues were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Dsp (LF-153), anti-biglycan (LF-106), or anti-decorin (LF-113) (24Fisher L.W. Stubbs 3rd, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 61-65Google Scholar) antibodies at 1:1000 dilution. The immune complexes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The peroxidase reaction in the immune complexes was visualized by a chromogen substrate 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Histostain plus kit; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Gene Targeting Strategy and Generation of Dspp–/– Mice—We have previously reported cloning and characterization of the mouse Dspp gene (4Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Google Scholar). The targeting construct was designed to replace the entire coding region of Dspp with the promoterless β-galactosidase gene (Fig. 1a). The successful disruption of the Dspp gene was confirmed by Southern hybridization using a 3′-flanking probe (data not shown). The targeted ES cells clones were injected into blastocysts to generate the chimeras. The high-percentage chimeras were mated with wild-type mice to obtain heterozygous mice. Genotypes of these mice were confirmed by Southern hybridization using a 3′-flanking probe (Fig. 1b), and the lack of gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1c) and by in situ hybridization using a Dspp exon 3–4 –specific riboprobe (Fig. 1, d and e). Dspp protein expression was analyzed by immuno-histochemistry (Fig. 1, f and g). The null mice did not show any overt tooth phenotype until 2–3 months of age. Occasionally, the incisors appeared broken in some older null mice (Fig. 1h). Dspp–/– Mice Exhibit Tooth Mineralization Defects—Qualitative differences in mineral density between the control teeth and Dspp–/– molars and incisors (Fig. 2, a–d) were observed in 70-day-old mice. The pulp chambers in the molars from mutant mice showed significant enlargement (Fig. 2, a and b). Mineralization defects in the Dspp–/– mouse incisors were characterized as globular dentin with extensive inter-globular regions. The presence of globular dentin, a marker of abnormally mineralized dentin, was prominent at the incisal end of the Dspp–/– mice (Fig. 2d) compared with the wild-type incisors (Fig. 2c). Early signs of pulp exposure were observed in the molars of Dspp–/– mice from about 2–3 months of age (Fig. 2 e, f). Pulp exposures seemed to occur randomly among all the molars. An increased incidence of pulp degeneration was observed in older Dspp–/– mice. Because of pulp exposure and severe attrition, the tooth crowns were worn to the level of the gingiva (Fig. 2, g and h). The molars from these mutant mice that are affected with pulp exposure also displayed relatively shortened tooth roots. The discoloration of teeth observed in the mutant mice was caused by pulp exposure followed by increased pulp degeneration (Fig. 2, e–h). Incisors of Dspp–/– mice did not exhibit either attrition or pulp exposures. Distribution of calcium in the teeth and surrounding alveolar bone, examined qualitatively by von Kossa's staining, displayed no significant differences in the mutant mouse (Fig. 2, i and j). The alveolar bone resorption was evident around the tooth root only in the Dspp–/– teeth that were affected by pulp exposure as a result of hypomineralization of dentin. It has been reported previously that alveolar bone resorption occurs as a result of inflammation in experimentally induced pulp infections in rodents (25Balto K. White R. Mueller R. Stashenko P. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. Oral Radiol. Endod. 2002; 93: 461-468Google Scholar). Reduced Thickness of Dentin, Widened Predentin, and Irregular Mineralization Front in Dspp–/– Teeth—Scanning electron microscopy of fractured Dspp–/– teeth showed an increased predentin region (Fig. 3, a and b) with the scalloped (irregular) dentin-predentin border (Fig. 3, c and d). The irregular mineralization front observed in the null mice was caused by a lack of proper coalescence of calcospherites. Void spaces and scalloped dentin in the mineralized dentin were also observed in Dspp–/– teeth (Fig. 3, e–h). The widened predentin in the Dspp–/–mouse teeth frequently lacked a visible dense collagenous network lining the dentinal tubules, and the well-organized intertubular dentin was absent because of masking of the fibers by increased hydration or by proteins (Fig. 3, i and j). Type I collagen fibrils, the most abundant component of the dentin extracellular matrix, appeared normal in the Dspp–/– dentin and were arranged in a pattern similar to that seen in the wild-type tissue (Fig. 3, k and l). The size of the collagen fibers and the cross-striation dimension (control, ∼67 nm; Dspp–/–, ∼60 nm from transmission electron microscopy measurements) were similar and appeared normal in the Dspp–/– and control mice. Increased Proteoglycans in Widened Predentin of the Dspp–/– Mice—Histological analysis revealed a marked reduction in the width of the mineralized dentin and an increase in the width of the predentin. The unmineralized layer (predentin) of molar (Fig. 4, a–d) and incisor (Fig. 4, e and f) dentin was similar to the widened predentin in human teeth affected with DGI-III (17Witkop Jr., C.J. MacLean C.J. Schmidt P.J. Henry J.L. Ala. J. Med. Sci. 1966; 3: 382-403Google Scholar, 18Levin L.S. Leaf S.H. Jelmini R.J. Rose J.J. Rosenbaum K.N. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. 1983; 56: 267-274Google Scholar). During active dentinogenesis in molars, the predentin layer was initially wide and subsequently reduced to minimum at the coronal region of the mineralized dentin. Proteoglycans are among the few molecules that are identified in the dentin extracellular matrix and are synthesized and secreted by the odontoblasts. Prominent Alcian blue staining, which binds proteoglycans, was observed in the widened predentin region in the null teeth (Fig. 4i), and was lost upon chondroitinase ABC treatment (Fig. 4j), indicating increased levels and wider distribution of proteoglycans in the predentin of the null mice relative to the control mice. Increased Expression of Biglycan and Decorin in the DSPP–/– Odontoblasts—Expression of dspp, type I collagen, biglycan, decorin, mmp-3, gapdh, and β-actin was analyzed by RT-PCR in the enriched odontoblast population from wild-type and Dspp–/– incisors (Fig. 5). Biglycan and decorin, found in dentin and rich in GAG, belong to a family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans that are predominantly expressed in skin, bone, and teeth (26Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Google Scholar, 27Takagi M. Hishikawa H. Hosokawa Y. Kagami A. Rahemtulla F. J. Histochem.

Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2001; 12: 331-349Google Scholar, 30Septier D. Hall R.C. Embery G. Goldberg M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2001; 69: 38-45Google Scholar). Small leucine-rich proteoglycans have a well established role in collagen fibrillogenesis and collagen packing (31Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Google Scholar). Biglycan and decorin mRNA expression was increased in the Dspp–/– compared with the wild-type teeth. Type I collagen is one of the major components to play an essential role in the mineralization and structural integrity of dentin. The expression of type I collagen was not altered in the null teeth. It is believed that the removal of sulfated GAGs from proteoglycans is required to mineralize the matrix, because they mask the mineral nucleator sites on the collagen fibrils. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3, which is implicated in the degradation of GAGs from chondroitin 4-sulfate/dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans in the predentin and subsequently increases keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans near the distal part of predentin to form the mineralization front (32Hall R. Septier D. Embery G. Goldberg M. Histochem. J. 1999; 31: 761-770Google Scholar), was not altered in the Dspp–/– teeth. The expression of gapdh and β-actin, housekeeping genes, was used as control in these experiments. Increased Biglycan and Decorin May Be Associated with Mineralization Defects in Dspp–/– Teeth—To examine whether biglycan and decorin are involved in mineralization mechanisms, we analyzed their levels in the Dspp–/– and wild-type mouse teeth. In 6-day-old Dspp–/– mouse teeth, strong immunoreactivity for biglycan and decorin was observed in the predentin (Fig. 6, b and h) compared with controls (Fig. 6, a and g). Similarly, increased immunoreactivity of biglycan and decorin was also observed in 15-day-old (Fig. 6, d and j) and 1-year-old (Fig. 6, f and l) mouse teeth without pulp exposure. The prominent irregularity of the mineralization front observed in the teeth of Dspp–/– mice can be correlated with the lack of coalescence of the calcospherites in the mineralization process. Interestingly, high levels of biglycan and decorin were accumulated in the void spaces in the dentin (Fig. 7, a and b) where the calcospherites are not properly coalesced (Fig. 7, c and d). These data suggest that increased localization of biglycan and decorin in the predentin and dentin may potentially interfere with the mineral nucleation and subsequent coalescence of calcospherites in forming a defined mineralization front.Fig. 7Accumulation of biglycan and decorin in the inter-calcospherite spaces of the Dspp–/– teeth. Immunostaining of mouse tooth sections with biglycan (a), and decorin (b) shows accumulation around calcospherites.

Dspp, an important molecule in the dentin, is cleaved into Dsp and Dpp and localized predominantly in the dentin. Based on its gene expression and localization within the DGI-II locus on human chromosome 4q, Dspp is implicated as a critical molecule in converting predentin to dentin, and recently observed mutations in the Dspp gene in DGI patients further support its potential role in dentin mineralization. The primary phenotypic features seen in DGI-II and DGI-III are defective dentin that had been largely attributed to functionally defective or reduced levels of the Dspp products, Dsp and Dpp (33Takagi Y. Fujisawa R. Sasaki S. Connect. Tissue Res. 1986; 14: 279-292Google Scholar), or to mutations in the Dspp gene (8Xiao S. Yu C. Chou X. Yuan W. Wang Y. Bu L. Fu G. Qian M. Yang J. Shi Y. Hu L. Han B. Wang Z. Huang W. Liu J. Chen Z. Zhao G. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 201-204Google Scholar, 19Zhang X. Zhao J. Li C. Gao S. Qiu C. Liu P. Wu G. Qiang B. Lo W.H. Shen Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 151-152Google Scholar). These disorders also show significant phenotypic variations and degrees of severity. It has been suggested that the DGI-III phenotype could develop because of the homozygosity of the DGI-II mutation (17Witkop Jr., C.J. MacLean C.J. Schmidt P.J. Henry J.L. Ala. J. Med. Sci. 1966; 3: 382-403Google Scholar, 34Shokeir M.H. Clin. Genet. 1972; 3: 442-447Google Scholar). To analyze the precise functions of Dspp in tooth mineralization, we generated Dspp–/– mice, which develop defective and reduced dentin mineralization and pulp exposures similar to those of DGI-III patients. Mineralization of dentin is initiated at the predentin-dentin interface and forms the mineralization front, characterized by the presence of multiple globular mineral foci “calcospherites.” These calcospherites grow and coalesce with the adjacent calcospherites to form a relatively uniform mineralization front. A lack of proper coalescence of calcospherites in the dentin, an irregular mineralization front, and scalloped dentin similar to those of the DGI-III patients (18Levin L.S. Leaf S.H. Jelmini R.J. Rose J.J. Rosenbaum K.N. Oral Surg. Oral Med. Oral Pathol. 1983; 56: 267-274Google Scholar) were observed in the Dspp–/– mice. Type I collagen is the main component secreted by the odontoblasts, which form a visible network around the dentinal tubules in the peritubular region and in the intertubular predentin region. Such a network was not visible in the null mice because of increased hydration. Similar observations were made earlier in DGI (35Kerebel B. Daculsi G. Menanteau J. Kerebel L.M. J. Dent. Res. 1981; 60: 1655-1660Google Scholar). However, type I collagen bundles and organization in the dentin extracellular matrix seemed normal in the Dspp-null mice. The mRNA levels were also unaltered in these mice, indicating that the mineralization defects observed in the teeth of Dspp–/– mice were independent of collagens. During dentin mineralization, phosphoproteins, sialoproteins, proteoglycans and growth factors interact with each other to form predentin, which subsequently mineralizes to form dentin. A number of biochemical and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of chondroitin sulfate and GAGs in calcified tissues, including teeth (27Takagi M. Hishikawa H. Hosokawa Y. Kagami A. Rahemtulla F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 319-324Google Scholar). Proteoglycans belong to a family of glycoconjugates and contain one or more GAGs covalently attached to the protein core. The GAGs are known to bind calcium and interact with hydroxyapatite and are readily detectable by Alcian blue staining (23Smith G. Smith A.J. Browne R.M. J. Oral Pathol. 1988; 17: 55-59Google Scholar, 28Yoshiba N. Yoshiba K. Iwaku M. Ozawa H. Arch. Oral Biol. 1996; 41: 351-357Google Scholar, 36Scott J.E. Dorling J. Histochemie. 1965; 5: 221-233Google Scholar). Wider distribution of GAG staining observed in the predentin region of Dspp–/– mice indicated the presence of proteoglycans. Among small leucine-rich proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan have been well characterized for their presence in the tooth. In mouse teeth, decorin was localized in odontoblasts, predentin, and dentin and biglycan in odontoblasts and predentin (37Cam Y. Lesot H. Colosetti P. Ruch J.V. Arch. Oral Biol. 1997; 42: 385-391Google Scholar). In vitro studies have implied that decorin and biglycan play a crucial role in fibril growth and assembly. Decorin binds to specific sites of collagen fibrils very near the putative hydroxyapatite nucleation site, a “gap” zone in which mineral is preferentially deposited in the early stage of mineralization (38Landis W.J. Gravit. Space Biol. Bull. 1999; 12: 15-26Google Scholar, 39Landis W.J. Song M.J. Leith A. McEwen L. McEwen B.F. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 110: 39-54Google Scholar). Decorin also functions as an inhibitor of mineralization during primary ossification of rat embryo bones (40Hoshi K. Kemmotsu S. Takeuchi Y. Amizuka N. Ozawa H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 273-280Google Scholar). Interestingly, biglycan facilitates the initiation of apatite formation and inhibits the growth of apatite (41Boskey A.L. Spevak L. Doty S.B. Rosenberg L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 61: 298-305Google Scholar). Over-all, it seems that decorin and biglycan may have distinct roles in the mineralization process. The teeth of biglycan- and decorin-null mice also show widened and porus dentin and changes in collagen fibril diameter, indicating a crucial regulatory role for decorin and biglycan in the tooth mineralization. 2M. Young, unpublished data. Increased width of the enamel in the biglycan null teeth further indicated a repressor role in enamel mineralization (42Goldberg M. Septier D. Rapoport O. Young M. Ameye L. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 520-524Google Scholar). The increased levels and distribution of biglycan and decorin in the predentin of Dspp–/– teeth indicate that the increased biglycan and decorin may play a crucial role in the formation of a defined mineralization front. The gap zones and their connected channels in the collagen fibrils are the predominant hydroxyapatite nucleation sites in the early mineralization stage (43Weiner S. Traub W. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 262-266Google Scholar, 44Landis W.J. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1986; 94: 217-238Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that phosphophorin, a putative initiator of mineralization in dentin, is localized in the collagen fibril gap zones (45Traub W. Arad T. Weiner S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 251-255Google Scholar). Decorin binding to the gap zones of collagen fibril or near them may potentially block the mineralization sites and prevent interactions between collagen and the molecules that initiate mineralization (46Raspanti M. Alessandrini A. Ottani V. Ruggeri A. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 118-122Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that the Dspp products Dsp and Dpp, implicated in the tooth mineralization, could alter the levels of the proteoglycans. A number of factors have been known to regulate the expression of biglycan and decorin in a variety of tissues. TGF-β, a multi-functional cytokine, increases the levels of biglycan in MC3T3 cells (47Takeuchi Y. Matsumoto T. Ogata E. Shishiba Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 823-830Google Scholar). In an earlier study (22Thyagarajan T. Sreenath T. Cho A. Wright J.T. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11016-11020Google Scholar), we demonstrated down-regulation of Dspp expression in Dspp-TGF-β1 transgenic mice leading to dysplastic dentin. In these transgenic mice, we also observed elevated levels of biglycan and decorin by odontoblasts. 3T. Thyagarajan, unpublished data. The elevated levels of proteoglycans in Dspp–/– mice and their distribution in the non-mineralized regions of teeth suggest that the Dspp gene products may control proteoglycans in the coronal regions of the dentin, where the mineralization process is complete. In addition, type I collagen levels in Dspp–/– teeth were unaffected. Therefore, we suggest that the increased levels of proteoglycans in the mutant mice interact with the collagen fibrils and promote the maturation process; however, they may fail to dissociate from the mature collagen required for subsequent dentin mineralization. This may be a result of either a reduced rate of their turnover, accelerated rate of synthesis (gene regulation), or a combination of both, contributing to the increased non-mineralized region. Therefore, we propose that Dspp gene products, in addition to their suggested role in the nucleation of mineralization, may play a pivotal role in regulation of proteoglycans during dentinogenesis. Overall, our results indicate that the absence of Dspp and the altered regulation of proteoglycans may be the causative factors that contribute to the mineralization defects in this disorder.

Protein ubiquitylation has emerged as a versatile regulatory strategy (reviewed in Ref. 1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). In its best characterized role as a signal for proteasomal degradation, productive recognition of ubiquitylated substrates is shown to minimally require a tetraubiquitin chain (2Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Alternatively, studies in yeast attribute to monoubiquitylation an intrinsic capacity to target substrates both for internalization at the plasma membrane and sorting at multivesicular bodies toward destruction in the vacuole (reviewed in Ref. 3Hicke L.

In higher eukaryotic systems, ubiquitylation of cell-surface receptors, likewise, correlates with their down-regulation via orthologous trafficking pathways that employ counterparts conserved from yeast (8Bishop N.

Likewise, although it is clear that each endocytosed receptor is conjugated to several molecules of ubiquitin, it is currently unknown to which extent branching of the EGFR-conjugated ubiquitins occurs in living cells. Here we present evidence indicating that the action of c-Cbl is limited to the addition of monomeric ubiquitins, and these are sufficient for receptor endocytosis and degradation. Reagents and Antibodies—Unless indicated, reagents were purchased from Sigma. E1 was from Affiniti (Mamhead, Exeter, UK), and rabbit reticulocyte lysate from Promega (Madison, WI). The 528-IgG antibody was isolated from hybridomas and a Fab fragment prepared and labeled with Cy3. An antibody to EGFR was from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Anti-EEA1 mouse antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Fluorescently labeled antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Construction of Expression Vectors—A plasmid encoding a truncated EGFR (EGFR-ΔC) was prepared by introducing a STOP codon after amino acid 1087. The EGFR-ΔC4R mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Vectors expressing EGFR::Ub chimeras were prepared by overlap extension PCR and mutations introduced. HA-tagged ubiquitin, either WT or K0, was subcloned into pEFIRES. Bacterial expression vectors for wild type (His)6HA-Ub and (His)6HA-Ub-K0 were obtained by subcloning into the pET28 plasmid (Novagen). Recombinant ubiquitins were subsequently affinity-purified on Ni2+-conjugated agarose beads. Transient Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Transfections were carried out using 1 μg of DNA of each expression vector, and the total amount of DNA normalized with the respective empty plasmid. Cells were assayed 48 h after transfection. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, either directly or after immunoprecipitation, and protein bands detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—Receptor immunoprecipitates were extensively washed and resuspended in ubiquitylation buffer (40 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 2 mm ATP, and containing either rabbit reticulocyte lysate (1 μl) or recombinant E1 (0.1 μg) and E2 (UbcH5C; 7 μl of crude bacterial extract). Wild type or mutant (His)6HA-tagged ubiquitin (0.5 μg) and GST-Cbl (0.1 μg) were added as indicated. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Immunofluorescence—Cy3-labeled Fab (20 μg/ml) was incubated with cells at 4 °C for 90 min. Thereafter, cells were transferred to 37 °C for the indicated time intervals before fixation and visualization. Alternatively, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized for 10 min at 22 °C with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100. For labeling, cells were incubated for 1 h with an anti-EGFR antibody and after extensive washes incubated for an additional hour with a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse F(ab)2. Alternatively, coverslips were co-incubated with monoclonal anti-HA and anti-EEA1 antibodies, washed thoroughly, and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat F(ab)2 and a Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse F(ab)2. In Cells c-Cbl Promotes Conjugation of Several Ubiquitins to Each Receptor Molecule, but in Isolation It Appends Monomeric Ubiquitins to EGFRs—In line with previous reports, when co-expressed with EGFR in CHO cells, c-Cbl destabilized the receptor and enhanced receptor ubiquitylation (Fig. 1A). When immunoblotted, the destabilized EGF-activated receptors exhibited a ladder of bands representing molecules differing in the number of conjugated ubiquitins. This stoichiometric multiplicity can be attributed to conjugation of either a ubiquitin polymer (henceforth, polyubiquitylation), many mononeric ubiquitins attached to several receptor's lysines (henceforth, multiubiquitylation), or a combination of mono- and polyubiquitins. Polymerization of ubiquitin on a substrate utilizes certain lysines as branching sites (reviewed in Ref. 1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether c-Cbl possesses mono- or polyubiquitylating activity, we compared the in vitro modifying capacity of wild type ubiquitin (WT-Ub) with that of Ub-K0 that, by definition, is unable to form polymeric chains. Both forms were expressed in bacteria and included as the sole source of ubiquitin in reconstituted reactions containing an isolated EGFR. Surprisingly, upon co-incubation with a bacterially expressed c-Cbl, both WT-Ub and Ub-K0 reproduced similar patterns that, according to the observed molecular shift, corresponded primarily to a monoubiquitylated EGFR (Fig. 1B). Hence, the results suggest that c-Cbl is equipped with an intrinsic monoubiquitylating, rather than polyubiquitylating, activity. An Internalization-defective Mutant of EGFR Acquires Rapid Endocytosis and Degradation When Fused to a Single Ubiquitin—We predicted that once EGFR is tagged by a single molecule of ubiquitin, it will be sorted for endocytosis even when coupling to c-Cbl is not permitted. To test this prediction we utilized an internalization-defective mutant of EGFR, incapable of direct c-Cbl binding (EGFR-Y1045F (15Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar)). A single copy of ubiquitin was fused to the carboxyl terminus of Y1045F-EGFR, but to prevent formation of covalent adducts, we replaced the terminal glycine (Ub-G76), or both glycine 75 and glycine 76 (Ub-2GA) with alanines. Cell-surface biotinylation assays confirmed maturation and delivery of both parental and chimeric receptor forms to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). In unstimulated cells EGFR-Y1045F is not ubiquitylated (15Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and, consistent with previous studies, was found predominantly at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). In contrast, EGFR-Y1045F::Ub-G76A localized primarily to structures resembling endosomes. Indeed, co-staining of EGFR-Y1045F::Ub-G76A and the early endosomal marker, EEA1 (16Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), revealed a highly significant degree of co-localization (Fig. 2C). To track endocytosis of EGFR and yet avoid ligand- or antibody-induced internalization, we used a fluorescently labeled monovalent fragment of an anti-EGFR antibody (528-Fab). First, this analysis left out the possibility that EGFR::Ub chimeras, like some lysosomal enzymes (5Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 6Reggiori F. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5176-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), reach endosomal structures directly from the biosynthetic pathway. Second, when cells were preincubated on ice with 528-Fab and then transferred to 37 °C, we noted different kinetics of internalization; unlike EGFR-Y1045F, which remained largely at the cell surface and started appearing in intracellular vesicles only after 20 min (Fig. 2D), some chimeric receptors translocated into endosomes already 5 min after transfer to 37 °C, and their endocytosis peaked at 10 min. In line with different endocytic behavior, metabolic labeling showed the chimeras to be degraded considerably more rapidly than EGFR-Y1045F in the absence of EGF (Fig. 2E). These results imply that monoubiquitylation is sufficient for internalization of EGFR, and together with the data presented in Fig. 1, they suggest that Cbl-mediated tagging of monomeric ubiquitins sorts active receptors to degradation. Decoration of EGFR with Monoubiquitins, Not Polyubiquitins, Is Sufficient for Ligand-induced Receptor Degradation— The observed difference between c-Cbl's activity in isolation (monoubiquitylation) and in cells (multi- or polyubiquitylation) implies recruitment of a collaborating activity. Hence, we compared ubiquitylation of EGFR in the presence of recombinant E1 and E2 or a crude mixture of cellular factors (namely, reticulocyte lysate). Analysis under electrophoretic conditions aimed at resolving ubiquitylated species detected a significantly higher ladder of EGFR when incubated with c-Cbl and reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 3A). The smeary pattern was particularly detectable by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, indicating selectivity to active receptors. Furthermore, replacing wild type ubiquitin with a Ub-K0 did not change the ubiquitylation pattern (Fig. 3B). Conceivably, Cbl-induced monoubiquitylation of phosphorylated EGFRs is followed by recruitment of unknown effectors, which mediate additional monoubiquitylation. To resolve whether EGFR ubiquitylation in cells entails monomeric or polymeric ubiquitin, we utilized a series of ubiquitin mutants with individual lysine-to-arginine substitutions at known sites for chain branching in vivo (lysines 11, 29, 48, and 63 (1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 17Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar)). Preliminary analyses indicated that the ectopic ubiquitin attained a >10-fold excess over the endogenous molecule 18 h after transfection. Under these conditions all four mutants, namely K11R, K29R, K48R, and K63R, reconstituted similar patterns of ligand-induced EGFR ubiquitylation as wild-type ubiquitin (Fig. 3C and data not shown). Furthermore, no mutant inhibited or delayed EGF-induced degradation of EGFR, and hence, none of the tested lysines appears to be involved in ubiquitin chain branching. To consolidate this conclusion, reciprocal experiments were performed using Ub-K0. When overexpressed, this mutant acts as a terminator of ubiquitin polymerization. However, Ub-K0 expressing cells effectively incorporated the mutant form of ubiquitin into EGFR molecules, which retained their normal ubiquitylation pattern (Fig. 3C). As expected, when tested in conjunction with β-catenin, a well characterized substrate of polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, Ub-K0 abolished the typical ladder of ubiquitylated β-catenin (data not shown). Moreover, add-back mutants derived from Ub-K0 underwent comparable conjugation to EGFR, and even though they limited the extent of receptor degradation compared with WT-Ub, none extended or enhanced the ladder of ubiquitylated EGFRs (Fig. 3C and data not shown). In conclusion, because all lysine mutants of ubiquitin coherently generated a pattern consistent with multiubiquitylation, these results reinforce a role for monoubiquitin in sorting EGFR to endocytosis. Multiubiquitylation Confined to the Kinase Domain of EGFR Is Sufficient for Receptor Degradation—The results presented suggest that multiubiquitylation of EGFR is preceded by a monoubiquitylating event. In an attempt to map the putative site, we generated a truncation mutant containing lysines only within its kinase domain (EGFR-ΔC4R; Fig. 4A), a region essential for c-Cbl recruitment (12Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In vitro, EGFR-ΔC4R, like wild-type EGFR, underwent c-Cbl-mediated monoubiquitylation (Fig. 4B), raising the possibility that the kinase domain may be specifically targeted by c-Cbl. Testing EGFR-ΔC4R in living CHO cells lent support to this assignment. First, the EGFR-ΔC4R mutant, like the wild type receptor, underwent weak monoubiquitylation in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, regardless of its smaller number of potential acceptor sites, EGFR-ΔC4R underwent EGF-induced multiubiquitylation, and its degradation was accelerated by EGF and c-Cbl (Fig. 4C). Subsequent kinetic experiments, which are not presented, showed that both forms of EGFR underwent comparably rapid ubiquitylation, in support of the possibility that a kinase domain lysine serves as a founder monoubiquitylation site. Fusion of a single ubiquitin to different integral membrane proteins led to the conclusion that ubiquitylation controls cargo endocytosis (11Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 18Nakatsu F. Sakuma M. Matsuo Y. Arase H. Yamasaki S. Nakamura N. Saito T. Ohno H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Our work extends this notion to RTKs and envisages a stepwise process leading to the termination of growth factor signaling: ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR recruits c-Cbl (15Waterman H. Katz M. Rubin C. Shtiegman K. Lavi S. Elson A. Jovin T. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and then an E2 molecule, which is physically attached to c-Cbl, discharges its thioester-bonded ubiquitin at a lysine residue, likely located within the kinase domain of EGFR (Fig. 4). Because in isolation c-Cbl conjugates monomeric ubiquitins (Fig. 1B), and covalent attachment of a single ubiquitin drives endocytosis of an internalization-defective receptor (Fig. 2), we propose that the founder ubiquitin undergoes no branching, and its conjugation instigates sorting of ubiquitylated EGFRs. Predictably, the sorting mechanism involves adaptors bearing UIMs, such as Eps15 and epsin (7Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 10Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Conceivably, while at the cell surface or en route to the lysosome, EGFR is further decorated with additional monomers of ubiquitin. The mechanism of this secondary multiubiquitylation step remains unknown. Considering the ability of a single ubiquitin to drive receptor endocytosis, it is worthwhile asking why EGFR is multi-ubiquitylated? For one, multiple monomers may confer resistance to inhibition by deubiquitylating enzymes. Alternatively, successive monoubiquitylation may increase the avidity of EGFR binding to adaptors like Eps15 (10Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Last, multiubiquitylation rather than polyubiquitylation may confer to EGFR refractoriness to the 26S proteasome. Notably, both endocytic adaptors (20Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and one of the ubiquitin-binding proteasomal subunits (21Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) utilize UIMs to recognize their cargoes and substrates. Hence, in the endosomal pathway, the intrinsic inability of c-Cbl to attach more than one ubiquitin to EGFR and to subsequently polymerize ubiquitin may suffice the endocytic machinery while evading degradation by proteasomes. Consistent with a mechanism that evades the proteasome, c-Cbl undergoes self-ubiquitylation with no associated proteasomal degradation (22Wang Y. Yeung Y.G. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hence, the E3 ligase activity of c-Cbl may be confined to monoubiquitylation. This issue and the possibility that other E3 ligases complement the action of c-Cbl toward the EGFR are matters for future investigation. We thank Drs. W. Langdon, C. Pickart, Z. Chen, and D.

https://openalex.org/W2043217287,"The mechanism of receptor-induced activation of the ubiquitously expressed family of mammalian canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels has been the focus of intense study. Primarily responding to phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors, the channels are reported to receive modulatory input from diacylglycerol, endoplasmic reticulum inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and Ca2+ stores. Analysis of TRPC5 channels transfected within DT40 B cells and deletion mutants thereof revealed efficient activation in response to PLC-β or PLC-γ activation, which was independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphoshate receptors or the content of stores. In both HEK293 cells and DT40 cells, TRPC5 and TRPC3 channel responses to PLC activation were highly analogous, but only TRPC3 and not TRPC5 channels responded to the addition of the permeant diacylglycerol (DAG) analogue, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). However, OAG application or elevated endogenous DAG, resulting from either DAG lipase or DAG kinase inhibition, completely prevented TRPC5 or TRPC4 activation. This inhibitory action of DAG on TRPC5 and TRPC4 channels was clearly mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), in distinction to the stimulatory action of DAG on TRPC3, which is established to be PKC-independent. PKC activation totally blocked TRPC3 channel activation in response to OAG, and the activation was restored by PKC-blockade. PKC inhibition resulted in decreased TRPC3 channel deactivation. Store-operated Ca2+ entry in response to PLC-coupled receptor activation was substantially reduced by OAG or DAG-lipase inhibition in a PKC-dependent manner. However, store-operated Ca2+ entry in response to the pump blocker, thapsigargin, was unaffected by PKC. The results reveal that each TRPC subtype is strongly inhibited by DAG-induced PKC activation, reflecting a likely universal feedback control on TRPCs, and that DAG-mediated PKC-independent activation of TRPC channels is highly subtype-specific. The profound yet distinct control by PKC and DAG of the activation of TRPC channel subtypes is likely the basis of a spectrum of regulatory phenotypes of expressed TRPC channels.

In studies utilizing the triple InsP3R-deficient variant of the chicken B-cell line, DT40 (DT40 InsP 3 R –/–), we and others have determined that endogenous store-operated channels are observed to operate identically as in wild-type DT40 cells (DT40wt), indicating that the InsP3R is nonessential for endogenous store-operated channels (25Ma H.-T.

Our analyses reveal that TRPC3 channels are activated in response to PLC-coupled receptors and are mimicked by the application of exogenous DAG (28Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Another report using the same cells revealed that the expressed TRPC3 channels can reflect input from stores and InsP3Rs (30Vazquez G. Lievremont J.P. St J. Bird G. Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and it appears that the conditions under which channels are expressed may alter their coupling phenotype (6Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E263-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, under all conditions of expression, the TRPC3 channels are clearly activated by the application of DAG (28Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) indicating that members of the closely related subgroup of TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 channels can each be activated in response to DAG through a mechanism independent of PKC. Other members of the TRPC channel family appear to behave differently. Thus, the subgroup represented by the closely related TRPC4 and TRPC5 channel proteins are reported to respond to store depletion (11Philipp S. Cavalié A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S.

Akaike A. Satoh M. Mori Y. Kaneko S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, both TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels are reported to be unresponsive to the application of DAG (31Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). We therefore considered it important to investigate the role of store emptying and InsP3Rs in the activation of TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels utilizing the DT40 knockout cell lines and to assess how the activation of these channels in response to PLC-coupled receptors compares with the activation of TRPC3 channels. Our results indicate some important differences in the role of DAG as a mediator of TRPC channel activation and reveal that each TRPC subtype is strongly inhibited by DAG-induced PKC activation, reflecting a likely universal feedback control mechanism for TRPC channels.

Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) Transfection of Cells—All three DT40 cell types were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, harvested from plates by scraping, washed in reduced-serum Optimem (Invitrogen), and then resuspended in Optimem at a final concentration of 107 cells/ml. 12 μg of each of the plasmids to be transfected (containing either the human M5 muscarinic receptor, mouse TRPC5 channel, or human TRPC3 channel, each in the pcDNA3.1 vector) were taken with 5 μg of the marker DNA (eYFP) and added to 0.5-ml transfection cuvettes with an electrode gap of 0.4 cm followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of the cells in Optimem (107 cells/ml). After thorough mixing of cells and DNA, transfection was carried out using the Gene Pulser II electroporation system (Bio-Rad) at 350 mV, 960 microfarads, and infinite resistance. The cells were recovered in Optimem (no serum added) for 3 h and then resuspended in Optimem with 10% fetal bovine serum and applied to coverslips. Cells were allowed to attach for 3 h in the case of DT40 cells and overnight in the case of HEK293 cells before fura-2 measurements were undertaken. The overall efficiency of transfection (eYFP-positive cells) was 20–30% as detected during fluorescent imaging. The methods were similar to those described previously (28Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T.

Imaging of Intracellular Calcium in Single Transfected Cells—Cells grown on coverslips after transfection were placed in Hepes-buffered Krebs medium (107 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11.5 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4) and loaded with fura-2/acetoxymethylester (2 μm) for 25 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed, and dye was allowed to deesterify for a minimum of 15 min at 20 °C. Approximately 95% of the dye was confined to the cytoplasm as determined by the signal remaining after saponin permeabilization (35Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Cells on coverslips were place in “cation-safe” medium free of sulfate and phosphate anions (107 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2) in the absence or presence of 1 mm CaCl2, SrCl2, or BaCl2 as shown elsewhere (Ref. 28Venkatachalam K.

Ca2+ measurements in single transfected and groups of untransfected cells were made using an InCyt dual-wavelength fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc.). Cotransfected eYFP served as the transfection marker and was detected at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm. Untransfected cells (not expressing eYFP) were identified from the same field and served as control cells. After cell identification, fluorescence emission at 505 nm was monitored with excitation at 340 and 380 nm; intracellular divalent cation measurements (either Ca2+, Sr2+, or Ba2+) are shown as 340/380 nm ratios obtained from groups of single untransfected and transfected cells. The details of these divalent cation measurements were described previously (20Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

Resting Ca2+ levels in the HEK293 cells and T3-65 cells were 50–100 nm. All measurements shown are representative of a minimum of three and in most cases of a larger number of independent experiments. Materials and Miscellaneous Procedures—Plasmids obtained were as follows: human TRPC3 cDNA from Craig Montell (Johns Hopkins University), mouse TRPC5 from Michael Schaeffer (Freie Universitaet, Berlin), eYFP cDNA from Clontech, and human M5 musarinic receptor cDNA from L. Birnbaumer (UCLA). 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyecrol (OAG), RHC-80267, R59949, and GF-109203X were from Calbiochem. EGTA, carbachol, and PMA were from Sigma. Thapsigargin (TG) was from LC Services (Woburn, MA). Fura-2/acetoxymethylester was from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Anti-chicken IgM (M4 clone) was from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL. The DT40 cell lines were kindly supplied by Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki (Kyoto, Japan). The T3-65 clone was a kind gift from Lutz Birnbaumer (UCLA). The DT40 chicken B-cell line has been useful for evaluating the mechanisms by which store-operated channels and TRPC channels are activated. The high rate of homologous recombination in these cells facilitates targeted disruption of certain genes or groups of genes (26Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T.

Two such derivatives of these cells have been of particular use in assessing Ca2+ signaling mechanisms: the triple InsP3R-knockout variant DT40 cell line (DT40-InsP 3 R –/–), in which all three InsP3R genes have been eliminated (26Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and the PLC-γ2-knockout variant (DT40-PLC-γ2 –/–), which is devoid of both PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 subtypes (34Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

To gain more information on the activation of TRPC channels, we investigated the role of InsP3Rs and PLC-γ on the activation of TRPC5 channels in DT40 cells. As in earlier studies (25Ma H.-T.

DT40 cells were transiently cotransfected with TRPC5 together with eYFP to identify transfected cells as described previously (28Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The activation of TRPC5 channels in response to B-cell receptor cross-linking induced by the addition of 3 μg/ml anti-IgM was assessed in fura-2-loaded wild-type B cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of the BCR complex results in a cascade of non-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation events leading to activation of the PLC-γ2 enzyme, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to the products InsP3 and DAG (28Venkatachalam K. Ma H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, a substantial InsP3-mediated release of stored Ca2+ is observed, which slowly declines over a 6-min period as stores are depleted. As described previously (25Ma H.-T.

However, the addition of Ba2+ does not result in entry (Fig. 1A), reflecting the high divalent cation specificity of the endogenous store-operated Ca2+ entry process in these cells. Indeed, in keeping with other cells of hematopoietic origin, recent evidence clearly identifies operation of the CRAC (Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+) channel in DT40 cells (29Ma H.T. Venkatachalam K.

In contrast to wild-type cells, the transfected cells showed clear Ba2+ entry, reflecting the function of the exogenously expressed TRPC5 channel (Fig. 1A).

The CTD phosphatase, FCP1, catalyzes the dephosphorylation of RNAP II and is thought to play a major role in polymerase recycling. This study describes a family of small CTD phosphatases (SCPs) that preferentially catalyze the dephosphorylation of Ser5 within the consensus repeat. The preferred substrate for SCP1 is RNAP II phosphorylated by TFIIH. Like FCP1, the activity of SCP1 is enhanced by the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF. Expression of SCP1 inhibits activated transcription from a number of promoters, whereas a phosphatase-inactive mutant of SCP1 enhances transcription. Accordingly, SCP1 may play a role in the regulation of gene expression, possibly by controlling the transition from initiation/capping to processive transcript elongation.

II contains a C-terminal domain (CTD) composed of multiple repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. The progression of RNAP II through the transcription cycle is regulated by both the state of CTD phosphorylation and the specific site of phosphorylation within the consensus repeat (1Dahmus M.E. J.

The emerging overview of this process is that unphosphorylated RNAP II, designated RNAP IIA, enters the preinitiation complex, where phosphorylation of Ser5 is catalyzed by TFIIH (which contains Cdk7/cyclin H subunits) concomitant with transcript initiation (3Lu H.

Phosphorylation of Ser2 is catalyzed by the cyclin-dependent kinase P-TEFb (which contains Cdk9/cyclin T subunits) (10Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), it is not clear if the dephosphorylation of Ser5 precedes Ser2 phosphorylation. During transcript elongation in yeast, there is extensive turnover of Ser2 phosphates mediated by FCP1 and Ctk1, the putative P-TEFb homolog (13Cho E.-J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Finally, dephosphorylation of Ser2 by the FCP1 phosphatase regenerates RNAP IIA, thereby completing the cycle (14Cho H. Kim T.-K. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). FCP1 is a class C phosphatase containing a BRCT domain that is required for interaction with RNAP II and dephosphorylation of the CTD (15Archambault J. Chambers R.S. Kobor M.S. Ho Y. Cartier M.

It remains uncertain whether the activity of yeast FCP1 accounts for the dephosphorylation in vivo of both Ser5 and Ser2 and whether this is the sole activity that catalyzes CTD dephosphorylation. Mutations in FCP1 lead to increased phosphorylation of Ser2, suggesting that it functions in vivo in the dephosphorylation of Ser2 (13Cho E.-J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Yeast FCP1 appears more specific for Ser2 phosphate when synthetic peptides are used as substrate (23Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, mammalian FCP1 dephosphorylates both Ser2 and Ser5 in vitro in the context of native RNAP II (24Lin P.S. Dubois M.-F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45949-45956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, modifications such as that catalyzed by the Ess1/Pin1 peptidyl prolyl isomerase may alter the activity and specificity of FCP1 (25Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Wu X. Wilcox C.B. Devasahayam G. Hackett R.L. Arévalo-Rodríguez M. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J.

Given the importance of CTD phosphorylation in gene expression (28Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is essential to know whether additional CTD phosphatases exist and, if so, their specificity and the mechanisms by which they are targeted to RNAP II at discrete stages of the transcription cycle. Although FCP1 is the only reported CTD phosphatase, examination of the data bases reveals additional genes that consist principally of a domain with homology to the CTD phosphatase domain of FCP1. Three closely related human genes encoding small proteins with CTD phosphatase domain homology, but lacking a BRCT domain, have been identified. In the present study, we show that a gene located on chromosome 2 encodes a nuclear CTD phosphatase. This protein preferentially dephosphorylates Ser5 within the CTD of RNAP II and is stimulated by RAP74. Expression of this small CTD phosphatase (SCP1) inhibits activated transcription from a variety of promoter-reporter gene constructs, whereas expression of a mutant lacking phosphatase activity enhances transcription. This newly identified small CTD phosphatase appears to play an important role in the regulation of RNAP II transcription. Materials—SCP1 and SCP2 were obtained as expressed sequence tag clones from Invitrogen. The full-length cDNA for SCP1 (261 aa; AL520011), the cDNA encoding the variant of SCP1 (214 aa; BE300370), and SCP2 (AL520463) were subcloned into EcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX4T-1 and pcDNA3FLAG vectors by PCR. All clones were sequenced, and the corrected sequences have been deposited in the NCBI data base. The D96E, D98N mutant of SCP1 261 and the corresponding mutant of SCP1 214, D48E, D50N, were generated by QuikChange (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by sequencing. GST fusions were purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography, and SCP1 261 was generated by cleavage at the thrombin site encoded in the vector. Recombinant FCP1 was expressed and purified as described previously (24Lin P.S. Dubois M.-F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Human P-TEFb was partially purified from HeLa S-100 extract by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), DEAE 15HR (Millipore Corp.), and HiTrap S and phenyl-Superose (both from Amersham Biosciences). P-TEFb was dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Human recombinant Cdc2 kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. Rabbits were immunized with GST-SCP1 214. Anti-GST antibodies were adsorbed to GST-agarose and rabbit anti-SCP1 IgG (antibody 6703) was prepared by ammonium sulfate fractionation and protein G-Sepharose chromatography. RNAP II antibodies (8WG16, H5, and H14) were obtained from Covance. Preparation and Purification of 32P-Labeled RNAP IIO Isozymes and [32P]-GST-CTDo—Calf thymus RNAP IIA was purified by the method of Hodo and Blatti (31Hodo H.G. Blatti S.P. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with modifications as described by Kang and Dahmus (32Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific isozymes of 32P-labeled RNAP IIO were prepared by phosphorylation at the most C-terminal serine (CKII site) in the largest subunit of purified RNAP IIA with recombinant CKII and [γ-32P]ATP (17Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10500-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by CTD phosphorylation in the presence of 2 mm ATP with either purified CTDK1/CTDK2, TFIIH, P-TEFb, recombinant MAPK2/ERK2, or recombinant Cdc2 kinase. The RNAP IIO isozymes were individually purified over a DE53 column with a step elution of 500 mm KCl (29Payne J.M. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 80-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because only the most C-terminal serine is labeled with 32P and lies outside the consensus repeat, dephosphorylation by CTD phosphatase results in an electrophoretic mobility shift in SDS-PAGE of subunit IIo to the position of subunit IIa without the loss of label. GST-CTD was prepared and purified as previously described (34Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23390-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled GST-CTDo was subsequently prepared from GST-CTDa by CKII followed by MAPK2/ERK2. GST-CTDo was purified over a glutathione-agarose column with a step elution of 15 mm glutathione. Phosphatase Assays—PNθP reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 20 mm PNθP, and recombinant proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reactions were quenched by adding 800 μl of 0.25 n NaOH. Release of para-nitrophenyl was determined by measuring A 410. N-terminal biotinylated CTD phosphopeptides, composed of four tandem repeats YSPTSPS and containing phosphoserine at position 2 or 5, were synthesized (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX). Phosphatase reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 5.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 25 μm phosphopeptide, and wild type or mutant SCP1 were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 0.5 ml of malachite green (Biomol). Phosphate release was measured at A 620 and quantified relative to a phosphate standard curve. CTD phosphatase assays utilizing RNAP IIO and GST-CTDo as substrate were performed as described previously (35Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reactions were performed in 20 μl of CTD phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.025% Tween 80, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT) in the presence of 20 mm KCl. Each reaction contained specified amounts of GST-CTDo and/or RNAP IIO and was carried out in the presence of 7 pmol of RAP74. Reactions were initiated by the addition of FCP1 or SCP1 and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Assays were terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer, and RNAP II subunits and GST-CTD were resolved on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel images were developed by autoradiography and scanned by an Amersham Biosciences Image Scanner Storm 860 in the phosphor screen mode. Data were quantitatively analyzed by ImageQuant software. Tissue Culture and Transfections—Human 293, COS-7, and CV1 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% normal calf serum (Invitrogen). Subconfluent cells were transfected in six-well tissue culture dishes using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reporter and activator plasmids (100 ng each) and FLAG SCP1 (80 ng) or its mutant were used per well. For T3 and PPARγ transfections, 20 ng of retinoid X receptor plasmid was also added. The amounts of ligands used were as follows: 100 nm T3, 1 μm PPARγ 609843 (Ligand Pharmaceuticals), and 100 nm dexamethasone. LMX1 and E47 expression plasmids (100 ng) were cotransfected with 100 ng of the rat insulin promoter-luciferase reporter construct with the indicated concentrations of SCP1 and phosphatase-deficient SCP1 expression plasmids. The total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant by the addition of empty vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfections, and cellular extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, neutralized, and blocked using 2.5% fetal calf serum/phosphate-buffered saline. Rabbit polyclonal IgG 6703 was used at 1:100 dilution, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG H+L chains conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:250) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Mouse anti EEA1 was used at 1:1000, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (1:250). Omission of primary antibodies was used as a negative control. The coverslips were viewed using the Zeiss Axiophot, which is equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca ER firewire camera that runs on Improvision Openlab 3.0.9 software. Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitation experiments, 75% confluent COS-7 cells from a 10-cm dish were harvested in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were incubated with 20 μl of Sepharose-conjugated anti-SCP1 (6703) IgG at 4 °C for 6 h. Beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the complexes were evaluated by Western blotting using specific anti-RNAP II antibodies. Rabbit anti-SNX1 antibody was used as control IgG. SCP1 Is an RNAP II CTD Phosphatase—The alignment of three human proteins that are closely related to one another and have homology to the phosphatase domain of human FCP1 is shown in Fig. 1A. All contain the signature motif ψψψDXDX(T/V)ψψ. SCP1, located on chromosome 2q35, was initially designated nuclear LIM-interacting factor in the genome entry (36Marquet S. Lepage P. Hudson T.J. Musser J.M. Schurr E. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The full-length 261-aa protein is encoded by seven exons; a shorter NH2-terminal splice version of 214 aa is present in expressed sequence tag data bases. SCP1 has ∼20% homology to human FCP1 in the phosphatase domain, whereas the three SCP proteins are >90% homologous in this region. SCP2/OS4 located on chromosome 12q13 was co-amplified with Cdk4 in sarcomas (37Su Y.A. Lee M.M. Hutter C.M. Meltzer P.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1289-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and SCP3/HYA22 located on chromosome 3q22 was part of a large chromosome deletion in a lung carcinoma cell line (38Ishikawa S. Kai M. Tamari M. Takei Y. Takeuchi K. Bandou H. Yamane Y. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These represent a subset of proteins with putative CTD phosphatase-like catalytic domains found in plants, yeast, nematodes, and arthropods. The Drosophila and Anopheles genomes each contain a single highly conserved SCP ortholog. The SCP proteins lack the BRCT domain present in FCP1 (Fig. 1B). To determine whether SCP1 has phosphatase activity, the protein was expressed as a GST fusion and both SCP1 261 and SCP1 214 were assayed using PNθP as substrate. As reported for FCP1 from S. pombe (23Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) utilizing PNθP as substrate, the pH optimum for SCP1 phosphatase activity is near 5 (Fig. 2A). Phosphatase activity was Mg2+-dependent and resistant to the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin (Fig. 2B). Ca2+ could not substitute for Mg2+. Mutations of Asp96 to Glu (D96E) had little to no effect on phosphatase activity (data not shown), whereas mutating Asp98 to Asn (D98N) in conjunction with the D96E mutation completely abolished phosphatase activity (Fig. 2B). SCP1 is thus a class 2C phosphatase whose activity is dependent on acidic residues in the conserved DXD motif. SCP2 exhibited similar phosphatase activity (Fig. 2B). To determine whether GST-SCP1 214 has CTD phosphatase activity, GST-CTDo and RNAP IIO were utilized as substrates, and the activity of SCP1 was compared directly with that of FCP1. Recombinant CTDo (rCTDo) and RNAP IIO utilized as substrate in these experiments were prepared by the phosphorylation of purified GST-CTDa or RNAP IIA with casein kinase II (CKII) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, followed by phosphorylation with MAPK2/ERK2 in the presence of excess unlabeled ATP. MAPK2/ERK2 was used in these initial experiments, because it phosphorylates both GST-CTDa and RNAP IIA with comparable efficiency (24Lin P.S. Dubois M.-F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45949-45956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As expected, FCP1 efficiently converts RNAP IIO to RNAP IIA in a processive manner (Fig. 2C, lanes 7–12) (24Lin P.S. Dubois M.-F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45949-45956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even high concentrations of FCP1 did not result in measurable dephosphorylation of rCTDo (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–6) consistent with the idea that a docking site on RNAP II is required for activity (17Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). GST-SCP1 214 catalyzed the dephosphorylation of both RNAP IIO and GST-CTDo with comparable efficiency (Fig. 2D). In contrast to FCP1, the SCP1-catalyzed dephosphorylation of RNAP IIO appears nonprocessive in that a number of phosphorylated intermediates are visible in SDS-PAGE. SCP1 is specific for dephosphorylation of the consensus repeat in that the phosphate at the CKII site is not removed. As shown below, the pattern of dephosphorylation varies depending on the CTD kinase used in the preparation of RNAP IIO. Mutant SCP1 (D96E,D98N) lacked activity on either substrate (data not shown). SCP1 is thus a CTD phosphatase that acts on both RNAP IIO and rCTDo. SCP2 exhibits comparable CTD phosphatase activity when RNAP IIO is utilized as substrate (see Fig. 4). SCP1 Preferentially Dephosphorylates Ser5 of the CTD Heptad Repeat—To determine the specificity of SCP1 with respect to its ability to dephosphorylate specific positions within the consensus repeat, RNAP IIO isozymes were prepared in vitro by the phosphorylation of RNAP IIA with CTD kinases of known specificity. TFIIH, P-TEFb, and MAPK2/ERK2 preferentially phosphorylate Ser5 when synthetic peptides serve as substrate (39Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 40Ramanathan Y. Rajpara S.M. Reza S.M. Lees E. Shuman S. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10913-10920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas Cdc2 kinase phosphorylates Ser2 and Ser5 (41Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the specificity appears relaxed when RNAP II serves as substrate, RNAP IIO prepared with Cdc2 kinase is clearly distinct from RNAP IIO generated by other CTD kinases (24Lin P.S. Dubois M.-F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45949-45956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Results presented in Fig. 3A indicate that RNAP IIO, prepared by the phosphorylation of RNAP IIA with distinct CTD kinases, exhibit a differential sensitivity to dephosphorylation with SCP1. SCP1 most efficiently dephosphorylates RNAP IIO generated by TFIIH and was unable to dephosphorylate RNAP IIO prepared with Cdc2 kinase. SCP1 was also unable to dephosphorylate RNAP IIO generated by Abl tyrosine kinase (data not shown). The dephosphorylation of RNAP IIO isozymes prepared with P-TEFb, MAPK2/ERK2, and CTDK1/CTDK2 occurred at a reduced rate relative to that of RNAP IIO prepared with TFIIH. Furthermore, whereas the dephosphorylation reaction appears processive for RNAP IIO prepared by TFIIH, it is clearly nonprocessive for RNAP IIO generated by MAPK2/ERK2. In contrast, FCP1 shows no preference for RNAP IIO generated by TFIIH and efficiently dephosphorylates RNAP IIO generated by Cdc2 kinase (24Lin P.S. Dubois M.-F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45949-45956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results suggest SCP1 differs from FCP1 in substrate specificity, showing relative preference for the dephosphorylation of Ser5 in the heptad repeat. To investigate the relative reactivity of SCP1 for Ser2 and Ser5, a synthetic 28-aa peptide containing four heptad repeats phosphorylated exclusively on Ser2 or on Ser5 was dephosphorylated in the presence of increasing amounts of SCP1. As shown in Fig. 3B, SCP1 preferentially dephosphorylates the Ser5 phosphopeptide compared with the Ser2 phosphopeptide. This substrate specificity contrasts to that reported for FCP1 from S. pombe, which preferentially dephosphorylate the Ser2 phosphopeptide (23Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mammalian FCP1, within a comparable concentration range, did not act on either phosphopeptide (data not shown). These results using synthetic phosphopeptide substrates confirm that SCP1 preferentially dephosphorylates Ser5 phosphate of the CTD. Effect of RAP74 on the Activity of SCP1—The RAP74 subunit of TFIIF stimulates CTD phosphatase activity of FCP1 (17Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the domains of FCP1 that bind RAP74 are required for FCP1-dependent viability in S. cerevisiae (15Archambault J. Chambers R.S. Kobor M.S. Ho Y. Cartier M. Bolotin D. Andrews B. Kane C.M. Greenblatt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14300-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether RAP74 can also influence the activity of SCP. CTD phosphatase activity was measured at low enzyme concentrations to more readily detect stimulatory effects of RAP74. As shown in Fig. 4, RAP74 shifted the dose-response curve for SCP1-catalyzed dephosphorylation of RNAP IIO to an ∼10-fold lower concentration. The CTD phosphatase activity of the GST fusion forms of SCP1 261, SCP1 214, and SCP2 were also enhanced by RAP74. The presence of comparable concentrations of bovine serum albumin does not stimulate the CTD phosphatase activity of SCP1. In support of the conclusion that RAP74 stimulates the activity of SCPs, RAP74 bound directly to GST-SCP1 but not to GST (data not shown). The binding and stimulatory effects of RAP74 suggest that TFIIF is important for optimal CTD phosphatase activity for both FCP1 and SCP1. SCP1 Is Located in the Nucleus Associated with RNAP II— Although SCP1 lacks an obvious nuclear localization sequence, it is found in the nucleus. Immunofluorescence microscopy using a rabbit polyclonal anti-SCP1 antibody demonstrated nuclear localization of endogenous SCP1 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5B). Co-staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for nuclear identification and with the early endosomal marker EEA1 for cellular detail confirmed the specific localization of SCP1 in nuclei (Fig. 5, A and B). Co-immunoprecipitation was used to assess the association of SCP1 with RNAP II. Sepharose-immobilized anti-SCP1 IgG 6703 was used to immunoisolate SCP1 from COS-7 cells. Immunoisolates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-RNAP II antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5C, RNAP II was present in SCP1 immunoprecipitates, indicating that SCP1 and RNAP II either interact directly or are in the same macromolecular complex. To determine whether SCP1 preferentially associated with either Ser2 or Ser5 phosphorylated RNAP IIO, lysates were prepared in the presence of EDTA, to inhibit phosphatase activity. SCP1 immunoprecipitates were then blotted with monoclonal antibodies specific for Ser2 phosphate (H5) and Ser5 phosphate (H14). Both forms of RNAP IIO were present in COS-7 cell lysates.

It is known, however, that replication forks stall at lesions in the DNA template and need to be processed so that replication restart can occur. In fission yeast, the Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease complex (Mus81-Mms4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been implicated in the processing of aberrant replication intermediates. In this report, we identify the human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe EME1 gene and have purified the human Mus81-Eme1 heterodimer. We show that Mus81-Eme1 is an endonuclease that exhibits a high specificity for synthetic replication fork structures and 3′-flaps in vitro. The nuclease cleaves Holliday junctions inefficiently (∼75-fold less than flap or fork structures), although cleavage can be increased 6-fold by the presence of homologous sequences previously shown to permit base pair “breathing.” We conclude that human Mus81-Eme1 is a flap/fork endonuclease that is likely to play a role in the processing of stalled replication fork intermediates.

One of the greatest challenges that the cell has to face is to maintain genome integrity. A high level of fidelity during DNA replication is essential to achieve the accurate transmission of the genome from one generation to the next. To completely and correctly replicate the genome, replication needs to restart each time it encounters a block to replication fork progression. Such blocks could occur at nucleotide lesions (e.g. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers), DNA backbone gaps, regions of secondary DNA structure (e.g. triplet repeats), or protein-DNA complexes (e.g. RNA polymerases, DNA topoisomerases) (1McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 3: 859-870Google Scholar). In recent years, it has becoming increasingly evident that there is a connection between DNA replication and recombination that enables the replication fork to overcome such problems and facilitate faithful replication of the genome. Stalled replication forks can be repaired through a non-recombinogenic pathway (fork regression and repair) or through a recombinogenic pathway in which the stalled replication intermediates are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage to generate a double-strand break that can be repaired by homologous recombination (1McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 3: 859-870Google Scholar, 2Rothstein R. Michel B. Gangloff S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1-10Crossref Google Scholar, 3Cox M.M. Ann. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 53-82Google Scholar). RecQ family helicases have been implicated in the non-recombinogenic pathway of replication fork restart. This family of proteins includes Sgs1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rqh1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Bloom's, Werner's, and Rothmund-Thomson's helicases in humans (4Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 3: 169-178Google Scholar). That these proteins can suppress recombination is indicated by the hyper-recombination phenotype observed in sgs1 and rqh1 mutants and cell lines derived from individuals with Bloom's syndrome (5Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Borts R.H. Louis E.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 935-945Google Scholar, 6Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Alkhodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Google Scholar, 7Chaganti R.S.

The observation of a synthetic lethality between Sgs1/Rqh1 helicase and the Mus81 endonuclease in yeast (9Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar, 10Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Google Scholar) has raised the possibility that Mus81 is active in the recombinogenic pathway of replication restart. Consistent with this proposal, mus81 mutants in S. cerevisiae are sensitive to agents that stall replication forks (e.g. methyl methane sulfonate or UV) but not to agents such as x-rays that cause double-strand breaks (11Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 812-827Google Scholar). Mus81 is a component of an endonuclease that exhibits sequence similarity to S. cerevisiae Rad1 (XPF in humans), which forms a stable heterodimer with Rad10 (ERCC1 in humans) (9Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar, 11Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 812-827Google Scholar). Rad1/10 and ERCC1/XPF are involved in nucleotide excision repair where they promote incision close to a DNA lesion, as the DNA is opened by helicase activities (12Sung P. Reynolds P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26391-26399Google Scholar, 13Davies A.A. Friedberg E.C. Tomkinson A.E. Wood R.D. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24638-24641Google Scholar, 14De Laat W.L.

In S. pombe, Mus81 requires a partner protein, Eme1, for activity (16Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.H.L. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Google Scholar). Cells defective in MUS81 or EME1 have been shown to exhibit meiotic defects consistent with problems with the processing of recombination intermediates; this phenotype can be at least partially rescued by expression of the RusA Holliday junction resolvase (16Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.H.L. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Google Scholar). These studies raised the possibility that Mus81-Eme1 possessed Holliday junction resolution activity, a proposal that was supported by in vitro studies with Mus81-Eme1 protein. However, the ability of Mus81-Eme1 to cleave Holliday junctions is considerably lower than that observed with other DNA substrates such as 3′-flaps and replication fork structures (16Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.H.L. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Google Scholar, 17Doe C.L. Ahn J.S. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. J. Biol.

In S. cerevisiae, Mus81 interacts with Mms4, a distant homolog of Eme1 (19Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Google Scholar). Budding yeast defective in MUS81 or MMS4 exhibit a mild meiotic defect (20de los Santos T. Loidl J. Larkin B. Hollingsworth N.M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1511-1525Google Scholar), although recombinant Mus81-Mms4 protein shows the same specificity for forks and flaps as the S. pombe Mus81-Eme1 complex (18Whitby M.C. Osman F. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6928-6935Google Scholar, 19Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Google Scholar). In humans, immunoprecipitates of Mus81 complex derived from HeLa cells were shown to cleave Holliday junctions (21Chen X.B. Melchionna R. Denis C.M. Gaillard P.H.L. Blasina A. Van de Weyer I. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Vialard J. McGowan C.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1117-1127Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Mus81 endonuclease was a component of a Holliday junction-branch migration complex described previously (22Constantinou A. Davies A.A. West S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 259-268Google Scholar). However, when HeLa cell-free extracts were extensively fractionated it was found that the Mus81 endonuclease separated from the Holliday junction resolvase (now designated Resolvase A) and that the two junction endonucleases were distinct entities (23Constantinou A. Chen X.-B. McGowan C.H. West S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5577-5585Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas Mus81 exhibited a broad range of specificity, Resolvase A was found to be specific for Holliday junctions and exhibited a cleavage mechanism that was very similar to that observed with the Escherichia coli Holliday junction resolvase RuvC. In the work described here, we report the identification of a human homolog of Eme1 and show that it forms a stable complex with human Mus81 protein. A second, considerably smaller, potential partner (Eme2) was also identified by sequence similarity. We show that purified recombinant Mus81-Eme1 complex is an endonuclease and that the protein is specific for flap and replication fork structures. Mus81-Eme1 has a weak ability to cleave Holliday structures but does so only when the junction contains a migratable crossover that is known to cause base pair breathing. For these reasons, we suggest that the activities of human Mus81-Eme1 are likely to be targeted to a primary role in replication fork processing and repair. Gene Cloning—The human EME1 (accession number BC016470) and EME2 (accession number XM_113869) genes were identified by PSI-BLAST homology searches using the S. pombe EME1 gene as bait (16Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.H.L. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Google Scholar). EME1 was PCR-amplified from the IMAGE clone 2899969 and inserted into the Gateway vector pDEST17 (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmid pDEST17-hisEME1 was used for overexpression of Eme1 with a 6-histidine tag at its N terminus. Similarly, MUS81 was PCR-amplified from IMAGE clone 4135990 into pDEST15 (Invitrogen) and pDEST17 to produce fusion proteins with N-terminal GST- and His-tags, respectively. The resultant plasmids are designated pDEST15-gstMUS81 and pDEST17-hisMUS81. To co-express gstMus81 and hisEme1, we constructed the bicistronic plasmid vector pGex-gstMUS81/hisEME1. To do this, we amplified MUS81 and cloned it into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGex-bicis-His (a gift from Dr. N. McDonald), followed by the insertion of EME1 into the NdeI and HindIII sites. To co-express Mus81 and hisEme1, we inserted an adaptor (5′-CATGGGAATTCATCGATGGTACCAAGCTTC-3′) into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET21d. An EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pGex-gstMUS81/hisEME1 encoding MUS81-hisEME1 was then inserted into modified pET21d to produce pET21d-MUS81/hisEME1. The inserts present in pDEST15-gstMUS81, pDEST17-hisMUS81, pDEST15-hisEME1, pGex-gstMUS81/hisEME1 were all verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification—pDEST15-gstMUS81, pDEST17-hisMUS81, pDEST15-hisEME1, pGex-gstMUS81/hisEME1, and pET21d-MUS81/hisEME1 were grown at 30 °C in E. coli BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-PR (Stratagene) to an A600 = 1, and expression was induced by addition of 10 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase. Growth was then continued for a further 3 h. Cultures of bacteria (1 liter) carrying either pDEST17-hisMUS81 or pDEST15-hisEME1 were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of iced phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m NaCl. The cells were then lysed using a French press. The mixture was centrifuged for 1 h at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor, and the clear supernatant was loaded on a 5-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted using a 50-ml gradient of phosphate buffer containing 0.1–1.0 m NaCl and identified by SDS-PAGE. Peak fractions of hisMus81 or hisEme1 protein were pooled (∼40 ml) and mixed with 0.5 ml of Talon beads (Invitrogen). After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed with 5 ml of phosphate buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 25 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were then eluted with 4 × 0.5 ml washes with the same buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. Eluted proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled and dialyzed for 2 h against 4 liters of storage buffer (phosphate buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA), and frozen in 25-μl aliquots at –80 °C. The final yield was 210 μg for hisMus81 and 130 μg for hisEme1. Cell pellets obtained from 1-liter cultures of cells containing either pDEST15-gstMUS81 or pGex-gstMUS81/hisEME1 were resuspended in 50 ml of phosphate buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol and lysed using a French press. Following high speed centrifugation, as described above, the supernatant was loaded on a 5-ml phosphocellulose column and eluted using a 50-ml 0.1–1.0 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and incubated with 0.5 ml of GST-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 5 ml of phosphate buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and bound proteins were eluted with four washes of 0.5 ml of the same buffer containing 20 mm glutathione. Proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled and dialyzed for 2 h against 4 liters of storage buffer, and frozen in 25-μl aliquots at –80 °C. The final yield was 260 μg of gstMus81 and 105 μg of gstMus81-hisEme1. To produce the Mus81-hisEme1 heterodimer, 4 liters of cells carrying pET21d-MUS81/hisEME1 were resuspended in 100 ml of phosphate buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and lysed using a French press. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on a 10-ml phosphocellulose column and eluted using 100 ml of 0.5–1.5 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Peak fractions were supplemented with 1.5 ml of Talon beads and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with 10 ml of buffer containing 50 mm imidazole and eluted with 4 × 1.5 ml of buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. Proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled and dialyzed for 2 h against 4 liters of storage buffer, and frozen in 25-μl aliquots at –80 °C. The final yield of Mus81-hisEme1 was 215 μg. Coprecipitation Assays—A cell-free extract was prepared from an IPTG-induced culture (1 liter) of bacteria carrying pGex-gstMUS81/hisEME1. The extract (50 ml) in phosphate buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl was incubated with 0.5 ml of beads (either GST-Sepharose or Talon) for 2 h at 4 °C and eluted with 4 × 0.5 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 20 mm glutathione or 0.5 m imidazole, respectively. DNA Substrates—All substrates were prepared by annealing appropriate combinations of oligonucleotides and purified by gel electrophoresis. Junction X26 (23Constantinou A. Chen X.-B. McGowan C.H. West S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5577-5585Google Scholar), which was 32P-labeled in oligo 1, was composed of four oligonucleotides as follows: •Oligo 1: 5′-CCGCTACCAGTGATCACCAATGGATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′.•Oligo 2: 5′-TGGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATCCATTGTCTATGACGTCAAGCT-3′.•Oligo 3: 5′-GAGCTTGACGTCATAGACAATGGATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCGTCTTGTCAATATCGGC-3′.•Oligo 4: 5′-TGCCGATATTGACAAGACGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATCCATTGGTGATCACTGGTAGCGG-3′. Similarly, junction X0 (24Benson F.E. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5195-5201Google Scholar) was prepared by annealing the following four oligonucleotides: •Oligo 1: 5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′.•Oligo 2: 5′-TGGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCATCTGTTGTAATCGTCAAGCTTTATGCCGTT-3′.•Oligo 3: 5′-GAACGGCATAAAGCTTGACGATTACAACAGATCATGGAGCTGTCTAGAGGATCCGACTATCGA-3′.•Oligo 4: 5′-ATCGATAGTCGGATCCTCTAGACAGCTCCATGTAGCAAGGCACTGGTAGAATTCGGCAGCGT-3′. The splayed arm substrate was derived from XO and generated by annealing oligo 1 with oligo 4. The 3′-flap structure contained oligo 1 and oligo 4 with oligo 3short (5′-CATGGAGCTGTCTAGAGGATCCGACTATCGA-3′). The replication fork substrate contained oligo 1, oligo 4, oligo 3short, and oligo 2short (5′-TGGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCC-3′). To facilitate comparisons, the splayed arm substrate, the 3′-flap structure, the replication fork, and junction X0 were all labeled in oligonucleotide 1, which is common to each. Cleavage Assays—Reactions (20 μl) contained 32P-labeled substrate (∼1 ng) in 60 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the cleavage reactions were stopped and samples were deproteinized by a 15-min incubation in the presence of 2 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.4% SDS. Labeled DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% neutral polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Identification of Human Homologs of S. pombe Eme1—To identify a human homolog of Eme1, a PSI-BLAST search of the NCBI data base was performed using S. pombe Eme1 as bait. Similar attempts to identify human homologs of S. cerevisiae Mms4 were unsuccessful. However, among the sequences similar to S. pombe Eme1, we observed S. cerevisiae Mms4 and a Neurospora crassa Eme1 homolog (accession number AL356173). Additionally, two human proteins were identified, which we here designate Eme1 (accession number BC016470) and Eme2 (accession number XM_113869). Both are weak homologs, because human Eme1 exhibits just 17% identity and 26% similarity to S. pombe Eme1 and Eme2 shows 15% identity and 29% similarity (Fig. 1). Human Eme1 is a 583-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 65 kDa. The chromosomal localization of the EME1 gene is 17q21.3. In the NCBI data base there is a second version of the gene (accession number AK055926), which encodes a protein that is 13 amino acids shorter (residues 372 to 384 are missing). It is possible that these are two tissue-specific splicing variants, because the full-length Eme1 was identified from cDNA from choriocarcinoma cells, whereas the shorter variant was from a neuroblastoma. The EME2 gene, which localizes to 16p13.3, encodes a 245-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa. Eme2 shows 44% identity with Eme1 and aligns mainly with the C-terminal region of Eme1 (Fig. 1). When human Eme1 and Eme2 were aligned with S. pombe Eme1, the C-terminal regions were the most highly conserved (Fig. 1). To determine whether the human Eme1 and Eme2 C-terminal sequences were conserved in other proteins, a PSI-BLAST search was initiated using the last 160 amino acids of Eme1 and Eme2. Remarkably, a close match was identified in the human Mus81 protein. The alignment of full-length Eme1 and Eme2 with Mus81 is shown in Fig. 2. Previously, it was shown that S. pombe Mus81 and Eme1 interact via their C-terminal regions (16Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.H.L. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Google Scholar). The Mus81 C terminus is also related to the C-terminal regions of the S. cerevisiae RAD1 and human XPF proteins, and it has been shown that these regions are necessary for interactions between RAD1 and RAD10 (25Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Johnson D.K. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1177-1188Google Scholar) and between XPF and ERCC1 (26De Laat W.L. Sijbers A.M. Odijk H. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4146-4152Google Scholar). From our sequence alignments, it appears likely that human Mus81 also interacts with its partner proteins via C-terminal contacts. Interaction of Human Eme1 with Mus81—Because the human Eme1 protein (65 kDa) is similar in size to S. pombe Eme1 and S. cerevisiae Mms4, we tested it for specific interactions with human Mus81. For this purpose, a bicistronic vector for bacterial coexpression of gstMus81 and hisEme1 was constructed. Following expression of the two proteins in E. coli, GST-Sepharose beads were used in pull-down assays carried out with cell-free extracts containing gstMus81 and hisEme1. We observed that the GST beads pulled out both gstMus81 and hisEme1 (Fig. 3, lane c), as determined by SDS-PAGE in comparison with purified gstMus81-hisEme1 complex (lane g). Similarly, incubation of histidine-binding Talon beads with the extract led to the co-precipitation of both gstMus81 and hisEme1 (lane d). As expected, extracts prepared from E. coli expressing only one of the two proteins (either gstMus81 or hisEme1) showed only single bands in the respective pull-downs (lanes e and f). Furthermore, interactions between Mus81 and Eme1 were verified in Talon pull-downs from extracts prepared from E. coli carrying a bicistronic vector containing untagged Mus81 and hisEme1 (data not shown). We conclude that the gene identified here as human EME1 encodes the mammalian homolog of S. pombe Eme1 and that human Eme1 makes a stable complex with Mus81 protein. When similar studies were carried out with Eme2, we observed only a weak affinity for Mus81 (data not shown). Moreover, preliminary attempts to purify the Mus81-Eme2 complex were unsuccessful because the two proteins failed to form a stable complex. For these reasons, our subsequent efforts were focused on the Mus81-Eme1 complex. Activities of the Mus81-hisEme1 Complex—The Mus81-hisEme1 complex was purified from E. coli carrying the bicistronic vector pET21d-MUS81/hisEME1. Following induction with IPTG, a high level of expression of Mus81 and hisEme1 was observed (Fig. 4, lane c), but most of the overexpressed protein was found to be insoluble and precipitated during high-speed centrifugation. However, the remaining Mus81-hisEme1 present in the cleared supernatant (lane d) was purified by phosphocellulose chromatography (lane e), followed by Talon binding (lane f). The identity of Mus81 and Eme1 was confirmed by mass spectrometry. To determine the substrate specificities of the Mus81-hisEme1 complex, a series of branched DNA substrates was generated by annealing partially complementary oligonucleotides. These included splayed arm, 3′-flap, replication fork, and Holliday junction structures (Fig. 5), each of which was 5′-32P-end labeled in the strand common to all substrates. Using equal amounts of protein, we observed that the 3′-flap (lane j) and the replication fork (lane o) substrates were cut by Mus81-hisEme1. In contrast, very little cleavage was observed with the splayed arm (lane e) or Holliday junction (lane t) substrates. Previously, we showed that a partially purified fraction from HeLa cells containing Mus81 could cut 3′-flap and replication fork structures (23Constantinou A. Chen X.-B. McGowan C.H. West S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5577-5585Google Scholar). The purified Mus81-hisEme1 complex described here exhibited the same substrate specificity (compare lanes g with j, l with o, and q with t). Moreover, we found that the recombinant protein produced similar cleavage patterns as the HeLa fraction with the fork structure as determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis (data not shown). When the levels of cleavage of flap and fork structures by Mus81-hisEme1 were quantified by phosphorimaging, we observed that the flap and fork substrates were cut with a similar efficiency and that the specific activity of the nuclease with these substrates was ∼75× greater than that observed with the synthetic Holliday junction (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Quantification of the cleavage efficiency with the fork, flap, and Holliday junction substrates. Reactions were carried out as described in the Fig. 5 legend using purified Mus81-hisEme1 and 32P-labeled 3′-flap, replication fork, and Holliday junction (X0) substrates. The reaction products were separated by PAGE and the amount of cleavage quantified by phosphorimaging. Cleavage is expressed as a percentage relative to that observed with the replication fork substrate. The data presented are an average of five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Whereas purified Mus81-hisEme1 exhibited flap and fork endonuclease activity, neither hisEme1 (Fig. 5, lanes c, h, m, and r) nor hisMus81 (lanes d, i, n, and s) alone exhibited nuclease activity. We conclude that human Mus81-Eme1, like the yeast homologs, is functional as a heterodimer. However, at the present time, we have been unable to reconstitute the nuclease activity by mixing separately purified recombinant hisEme1 and hisMus81 subunits (data not shown). The synthetic Holliday junction (X0) used in the above experiments contains an immobile crossover. We therefore compared the cleavage efficiency of Mus81-hisEme1 complex on X0 with a second Holliday junction containing a 26-bp homologous core (X26) through which the junction is freely able to branch migrate. We observed that X26 served as a better substrate for Mus81-hisEme1 and was cut with an efficiency that was ∼6-fold greater than X0 (Fig. 7, compare lanes b and c with g and h). Similar results were obtained with the partially purified Mus81 fraction from HeLa cells (lanes d and i). In contrast to recombinant Mus81-hisEme1 or the HeLa Mus81 fraction, fractionated extracts from HeLa cells enriched for the human Holliday junction resolvase A (23Constantinou A. Chen X.-B. McGowan C.H. West S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5577-5585Google Scholar) cleaved X0 and X26 equally and efficiently (lanes e and j). Taken together, these results show that the endonuclease activity of Mus81-Eme1 complex is specifically targeted to flap/fork structures and that the efficiency of cleavage of Holliday junctions can be enhanced by inclusion of homologous sequences that are known to result in breathing of the synthetic junction substrate (27West S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 27-28Google Scholar). In this paper, we have reported the cloning of the human EME1 gene and show that Eme1 protein interacts with Mus81. Human EME1 was identified in a data base search using S. pombe EME1, although a similar approach using S. cerevisiae MMS4 was unsuccessful. Although it has been shown that recombinant Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 complexes cleave the same substrates with similar efficiencies (18Whitby M.C. Osman F. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6928-6935Google Scholar), Eme1 and Mms4 exhibit little (16%) sequence homology. A second potential Mus81 partner was also identified and named Eme2. This protein is 44% identical to Eme1 but, being less than half the length of Eme1, corresponds only to the Eme1 C terminus. Both Eme1 and Eme2 share sequence homology with the C-terminal portion of Mus81, and it is likely that this region is important for dimerization, as shown in S. pombe (16Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.H.L. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Google Scholar). Although our preliminary efforts to purify Mus81-Eme2 complex were unsuccessful, the possibility remains that human Mus81 may have more than one partner and raises questions relating to their functions in DNA metabolism. In future studies, it will be interesting to define whether Eme2 is a true interacting partner, to determine whether Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Eme2 exhibit related or different substrate specificities, and to determine whether there may be tissue-specific expression or induction following DNA damage or replicative stress. Activity of Mus81-Eme1 Complex—Recombinant human Mus81-Eme1 complex, purified after overexpression in E. coli, was found to exhibit nuclease activities very similar to recombinant S. pombe Mus81-Eme1 and S. cerevisiae Mus81-Mms4 (17Doe C.L. Ahn J.S. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32753-32759Google Scholar, 18Whitby M.C. Osman F. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6928-6935Google Scholar, 19Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Google Scholar). Human Mus81-Eme1 preferentially cleaved flap and replication fork structures while exhibiting relatively little (∼75-fold reduced) activity with Holliday junctions. However, we did find that junction X26, which contains a 26-bp region of homology through which the crossover can move, was cut with a greater efficiency than the static junction X0. Previously, using chemical probes that could detect the formation of transient regions of single-stranded DNA, we observed that mobile junctions exhibit a transient single-stranded character suggestive of base pair breathing (27West S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 27-28Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that the ability of Mus81-Eme1 to cut four-way junctions is likely to be because of the recognition of transient flap structures that are formed as the junction undergoes spontaneous thermal denaturation. Consistent with this proposal, it was recently shown (23Constantinou A. Chen X.-B. McGowan C.H. West S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5577-5585Google Scholar) that cleavage of Holliday junctions by Mus81 fractions prepared from HeLa extracts occurred at the 5′-side of the substrate and that the nicks were introduced without symmetry leading to the formation of non-ligatable products. These results contrasted with data obtained in similar experiments with Resolvase A prepared from the same HeLa extracts. We conclude that Holliday junction cleavage by Mus81-Eme1 is a secondary effect of its flap activity, rather than the sign of a bona fide Holliday junction resolvase. Possible in Vivo Mus81-Eme1 Functions—The observation that recombinant Mus81-Eme1 complex exhibits the same nucleolytic activity on 3′-flap and replication fork structures as Mus81-containing fractions purified from HeLa cells provides further support for a role for Mus81-Eme1 in replication fork restart. The primary mechanism by which stalled forks are repaired is likely to involve fork regression such that the newly synthesized leading and lagging strands can anneal to form a fork that has a fourth arm, in a structure reminiscent of a chicken foot (28Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Google Scholar, 29Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2790-2796Google Scholar). Fork regression can allow repair of the blocking lesion, such that the repaired fork can subsequently be restored by the actions of RecQ family helicases, such as Sgs1 and human Bloom's and Werner's helicases. These proteins have been shown to exhibit branch migration activity in vitro (30Bennett R.J. Sharp J.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9644-9650Google Scholar, 31Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.-L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Google Scholar, 32Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C. EMBO R. 2000; 1: 80-84Google Scholar). An alternative pathway for fork restoration may involve Mus81-Eme1-mediated nucleolytic cleavage of the stalled fork or the structure formed by fork regression. The resulting double-strand break would be expected to initiate recombinational repair reactions that would give rise to a new replication fork. Recently, electron microscopic studies of stalled replication forks in yeast showed that some regressed forks exhibited a single-stranded reverse arm structure (28Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Google Scholar). Because S. cerevisiae Mus81-Mms4 and S. pombe Mus81-Eme1 cleave synthetic replication fork structures with single-stranded regressed tails (18Whitby M.C. Osman F. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6928-6935Google Scholar), it is to be expected that similar cleavage reactions would take place in vivo. Additionally, Mus81 complex may be able to cleave the chicken foot intermediate, albeit with reduced efficiency. Finally, the stalled fork itself would be expected to present an efficient substrate for Mus81 complex, because related structures are good in vitro substrates. The possibility that Mus81 and RecQ family helicases provide alternative or complementary pathways for replication fork restart is supported by the finding that mus81 is synthetic lethal in combination with sgs1 or rqh1 in yeast (9Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar, 10Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that mus81 sgs1 lethality can be rescued by mutations in genes involved in homologous recombination (RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, and RAD57) indicates a role for Mus81 that is dependent on the initiation of recombination (33Fabre F. Chan A. Heyer W.D. Gangloff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16887-16892Google Scholar). Considering the high specificity that Mus81 shows for 3′-flaps, it has been proposed that Mus81 could be involved in the cleavage of 3′-overhangs that protrude from duplex DNA after reinvasion of the original strand in synthesis-dependent strand annealing recombination. This process could be initiated by single-stranded gaps that form at stalled replication forks (33Fabre F. Chan A. Heyer W.D. Gangloff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16887-16892Google Scholar). The identification of the interaction between Mus81 and the forkhead-associated domain (FHA) of replication checkpoint kinase Rad53/Cds1/Chk2 both in yeast and in mammalian cells (9Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Google Scholar, 21Chen X.B. Melchionna R. Denis C.M. Gaillard P.H.L. Blasina A. Van de Weyer I.

Mann M. Hogue C.W. Figeys D. Tyers M. Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Google Scholar) points to a possible checkpoint regulation of Mus81 activity. Preliminary data suggest that Sgs1 also interacts with the FHA domain of S. cerevisiae Rad53 (35Cobb J.A. Bjergbaek L. Gasser S.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 43-48Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, Rad53 has been implicated in the stabilization of stalled replication forks in S. cerevisiae (36Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X.

It is possible that Rad53, interacting with both Mus81 and Sgs1, could regulate the choice of pathway utilized for replication fork restart under particular stress conditions. In summary, the biochemical data presented here support the notion that the primary cellular function of human Mus81-Eme1 is likely to be similar to that proposed to occur in yeast, in which aberrant replication fork intermediates serve as targets for the nuclease. Defects in this activity in mammalian cells are likely to result in genome instability and a predisposition to carcinogenesis.

These findings have been attributed to a block in cholesterol movement from lysosomes to the site of the sterol regulatory machinery. In this study we show that Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) and Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) mutants have increased cellular cholesterol, yet they are unable to suppress LDL receptor activity and cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol overload in both NPC1 and NPC2 mutants results from the failure of LDL cholesterol tobothsuppresssterolregulatoryelement-bindingprotein-dependent gene expression and promote liver X receptor-mediated responses. However, the severity of the defect in regulation of sterol homeostasis does not correlate with endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol levels, but rather with the degree to which NPC mutant fibroblasts fail to appropriately generate 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in response to LDL cholesterol. Moreover, we demonstrate that treatment with oxysterols reduces cholesterol in NPC mutants and is able to correct the NPC1I1061T phenotype, the most prevalent NPC1 disease genotype. Our findings support a role for NPC1 and NPC2 in the regulation of sterol homeostasis through generation of LDL cholesterol-derived oxysterols and have important implications for the treatment of NPC disease.

Similarly, in the NPC1–/– mice, which phenocopy human NPC disease, cholesterol synthesis in the whole animal is elevated, and there is increased accumulation of unesterified cholesterol (16Xie C. Turley S.D. Pentchev P.G. Dietschy J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E336-E344PubMed Google Scholar). These sterol regulatory defects have been attributed to impaired delivery of LDL-derived free cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Decreased ER cholesterol promotes SCAP-mediated trafficking of SREBP to the Golgi, enabling SREBP proteolysis and up-regulation of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake (17Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study is to characterize the relationship between the NPC proteins and the sterol regulatory machinery. Thus, we examined the consequence of NPC1and NPC2 loss of function on the key cellular pathways that govern cholesterol homeostasis. We find that cholesterol overload in NPC1 and NPC2 mutants results from the failure of LDL cholesterol to both suppress SREBP-dependent gene expression and promote liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated responses. We show that the sterol regulatory defects in the NPC mutants correlate with the failure to generate oxysterols in response to LDL cholesterol loading, rather than with ER cholesterol levels. Our findings indicate that the NPC proteins regulate sterol homeostasis through production of LDL cholesterol-derived oxysterols and have implications for the treatment of NPC disease.

A chromatography recovery standard was added (30 μg of cholesteryl oleate, 30 μg of triolein, 0.0005 μCi of [14C]cholesteryl oleate), and samples were dried under nitrogen. The lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC, PE SIL G plates from Whatman) using heptane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (90:30:1) and visualized with iodine. [3H]Cholesteryl oleate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. After lipid extraction, monolayers were incubated with 0.1 n NaOH and protein determination performed using the MicroBCA assay (Pierce).

Luciferase Reporter Assays—For quantification of SREBP-dependent gene expression, fibroblasts were co-transfected using nucleofection (Amaxa) with 2 μg of LDLp-588luc and 0.2 μg of pRL-TK. Using the nucleofection method, transfection efficiencies of >90% were achieved in the human fibroblasts. On day 1, cells were re-fed lipoprotein-deficient medium. On day 2 cells were pulsed with LDL (0–80 μg/ml) for 24 h, followed by harvest of cell lysates and determination of luciferase and Renilla activity (Promega). Normalization of luciferase activity to Renilla activity controlled for transfection efficiency. For determination of LXR-activated gene expression, fibroblasts were co-transfected with 2 μg of TK-LXRE3-luc and 0.2 μg of pRL-TK. On day 1, cells were re-fed lipoprotein-deficient medium.

In Vitro Cholesterol Esterification Assay—Fibroblasts were grown for 48 h in DMEM, 10% FBS, or for 24 h in DMEM, 10% LPDS followed by re-feeding with DMEM, 10% LPDS in the presence and absence of 50 μg/ml LDL or 2.5 μm 25-HC. The in vitro esterification assay was performed as described by Lange and Steck (22Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 0.1 m sucrose, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and swelled on ice for 10 min. The cells were homogenized with 10 strokes using a ball bearing homogenizer with an 11-μm clearance, centrifuged to remove large particles, and adjusted to 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Esterification reactions were started by addition of 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After extraction with CH3Cl:methanol (2:1) and addition of a recovery standard (40 μg of cholesterol, 30 μg of cholesteryl oleate, 0.002 μCi of [3H]cholesterol), lipids were dried under nitrogen. Cholesteryl oleate was recovered by TLC and quantified as described under “Cholesterol Esterification Assays.” Protein determinations were performed using the BCA assay. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) Determinations— For oxysterol measurements, fibroblasts were grown in DMEM, 10% LPDS for 48 h and then re-fed for 24 h DMEM, 10% LPDS containing 50 μg/ml LDL. Oxysterols were extracted from the cells and media as described (23Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 24Fu X.

Since 24-HC was not detected in the fibroblasts, we used 200 pmol of 24-HC as an internal standard during oxysterol isolation. Oxysterols were derivatized to trimethylsilyl ethers by treatment with Sigma Sil-A for 1 h at 60 °C. Derivatized samples were analyzed on a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph interfaced to a Finnigan SSQ 7000 mass spectrometer. The GC column used for the study was a DB-1 (12.5 m, 0.2 mm inner diameter, 0.33-μm film coating, P. J. Cobert, St. Louis, MO). A gradient was run as follows. The initial temperature of 180° was held for 1 min and increased to 250 at 20°/min. The temperature was increased from 250 to 300° at 5°/min and held for 10 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode, and the source temperature, electron energy, and emission current were 200°, 100 eV, and 300 μA, respectively. The injector and transfer line temperatures were 250°. The presence of 27-HC and 25-HC was monitored with ions at m/z 456 at 16.3 min and m/z 131 at 15.6 min, respectively. Quantitative GC/MS determinations for 25-HC and 27-HC were calculated from triplicate injections. Total oxysterol production was determined as the sum of oxysterols in the cells and secreted into the medium. Filipin Staining—Cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FBS for 48 h in the presence and absence of 0.25 μm 25-HC or 2.5 μm 25-HC. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with 50 μg/ml filipin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Filipin fluorescence was detected by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axiovert epifluorescence microscope using 360/40 nm excitation and 460/50 emission filters (Chroma). For each condition a minimum of 70 cells were scored on each of two coverslips, and only filipin-negative cells (i.e. fluorescence intensity equivalent to normal fibroblasts) were scored as fully corrected cells. Regulation of Sterol Homeostatic Responses Is Defective in NPC Mutants—To gain insight into the molecular function of the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins, we examined the consequence of NPC mutations on regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. We first compared the rates of LDL-stimulated cholesterol esterification in NPC1 and NPC2 mutants. In these experiments we examined NPC1 fibroblasts harboring NPC1I1061T or NPC11628delC mutations and NPC2 cells with NPC2IVS2+5G→A or NPC2G58T mutations (20Sun X. Marks D.L. Park W.D. Wheatley C.L. Puri V. O'Brien J.F. Kraft D.L. Lundquist P.A. Patterson M.C. Pagano R.E. Snow K. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Millat G. Chikh K. Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Fensom A.H. Higaki K. Elleder M. Lobel P. Vanier M.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The rate of cholesterol esterification in these NPC genotypes is reduced to less than 8% of normal fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Since both NPC1 and NPC2 mutants exhibit normal acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity in response to stimulation by 25-HC (Fig. 1B), the absence of LDL cholesterol esterification is not due to defective ACAT activity in these cells. These results are consistent with current models for NPC1 and NPC2 function in trafficking of LDL cholesterol out of the lysosomal compartment. We next examined the effect of the NPC mutations on accumulation of cholesterol. For these experiments, we compared NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T cells to normal fibroblasts. In lipoprotein-fed NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T mutant fibroblasts, we find that total cellular cholesterol is elevated 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively, over normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the increased cellular cholesterol in the NPC mutants was due to defective regulation of LDL cholesterol uptake and/or de novo cholesterol synthesis, we performed the following studies. LDLr activity in the fibroblasts was measured using an established, quantitative assay that monitors the uptake of DiI-LDL, a fluorescent-tagged LDL, by flow cytometry (26Stephan Z.F. Yurachek E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chan P.-C. Edwards A. Lafreniere R. Parsons H.C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2261-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this method, uptake of DiI-LDL was abolished in the presence of 80-fold excess of unlabeled LDL, demonstrating that the DiI-LDL uptake is a specific measure of LDLr activity (data not shown). Despite the marked cholesterol overload in NPC fibroblasts, LDLr activity in the NPC mutants fails to suppress in response to LDL feeding (Fig. 2B). In comparison with normal fibroblasts, LDLr is increased 1.6- and 2-fold in the NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T, respectively. Similar results were obtained using an 125I-LDL receptor binding assay (data not shown). These findings mirror the inability of LDL cholesterol to suppress de novo cholesterol synthesis in NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T mutants (elevated 1.5- and 3-fold, respectively) (Fig. 2C). In response to lipoprotein starvation, the NPC2G58T mutant up-regulates LDLr activity and de novo cholesterol synthesis, responses that are inappropriate for cholesterol overloaded cells. On the other hand, the NPC1I1061T mutant only partially up-regulates LDLr activity and de novo cholesterol synthesis. This finding suggests that in the NPC1I1061T mutant, accumulated lysosomal cholesterol is partially available for regulation of cholesterol homeostatic responses. NPC Mutants Fail to Suppress SREBP-dependent Gene Expression—It has been proposed that the local ER cholesterol pool accessible to ACAT serves as the cholesterol pool that controls cellular cholesterol content through regulated proteolysis of SREBPs (28Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). To determine whether the altered LDLr activity and de novo cholesterol synthesis in NPC mutants are attributable to a failure to suppress SREBP proteolysis, we examined the effect of NPC mutations on SREBP-dependent gene transcription using an sterol regulatory element-containing reporter construct as an indicator of the status of SREBP maturation (18Grand-Perret T. Bouillot A. Commans S. Walker M. Issandou M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1332-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For these and all subsequent experiments, we compared NPC mutants with moderate (NPC1I1061T) and severe (NPC2G58T) defects in sterol regulatory activity to normal fibroblasts. Constructs were introduced into these primary fibroblasts by nucleofection, a method that routinely affords >90% transfection efficiency in our hands (data not shown). Compared with normal fibroblasts, the NPC1I1061T mutant is resistant to suppression of SREBP-dependent activity at low concentrations of LDL (20 μg/ml), but is partially suppressed at high concentrations of LDL (60–80 μg/ml). In contrast, the NPC2G58T mutant shows no suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression by LDL cholesterol over the range of concentrations examined (Fig. 3A). Failure to appropriately suppress SREBP-mediated gene suppression is not unexpected in NPC cells given their known cholesterol trafficking defects. Defects in Sterol Regulation in NPC Mutants Do Not Correlate with ER Cholesterol Levels—We hypothesized that if failure to suppress SREBP processing in NPC cells results from failure to deliver cholesterol to the ER, then ER cholesterol levels should correlate with the severity of the biochemical phenotype. We measured cholesterol levels in the ER using an in vitro esterification assay (22Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In normal fibroblasts, cholesterol in the ACAT-accessible pool is reduced under conditions of lipoprotein starvation, and is elevated following treatment with either LDL cholesterol or 25-HC, consistent with the expected changes in the ER regulatory pool (Fig. 3B). In lipoprotein-fed NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T mutant fibroblasts, the size of the ER cholesterol pool is identical to that of normal fibroblasts. Nonetheless, these cells show persistent LDLr activity and de novo cholesterol synthesis in the mutants. Similarly, in lipoprotein-starved NPC mutants, ER cholesterol content is comparable with that of normal fibroblasts. Upon LDL stimulation, the ER cholesterol levels achieved are lower in both the NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T mutants compared with normal fibroblasts, consistent with impaired trafficking of LDL cholesterol. However, the failure to increase ER cholesterol in response to LDL is more pronounced in the NPC1I1061T than the NPC2G58T mutant (0.86 ± 0.06 versus 1.23 ± 0.13 pmol/ mg/h), whereas the defect in regulation of sterol homeostatic responses is more severe in the NPC2G58T mutant. Thus, the relative biochemical defects between the NPC mutants do not correlate with differences in steady-state ER cholesterol levels. LXR-activated Gene Expression Is Attenuated in NPC Mutants—The disparity between ER cholesterol levels and SREBP-mediated transcriptional responses suggests that regulatory molecules other than free ER cholesterol may be important for genesis of the NPC phenotype. Recent studies demonstrate that oxysterol cholesterol metabolites are ligands for LXRs, which regulate cellular cholesterol balance by transactivation of genes that promote catabolism and elimination of excess free cholesterol (29Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Treatment with LXR agonists has been shown to induce expression of sterol transporters, such as ABCA1 and ABCG5/ABCG8, as well as a number of target genes that function in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway (30Joseph S.

To determine the effect of NPC mutations on LXR-mediated gene expression, we examined in NPC mutant fibroblasts the expression of a reporter construct driven by an LXR response element (19Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In normal fibroblasts LXR activity increases with increasing concentrations of LDL cholesterol (Fig. 4). In NPC fibroblasts, on the other hand, stimulation of LXR activity in the NPC1I1061T mutant occurs only at high concentrations of LDL (60–80 μg/ml), and no stimulation of LXR activity is observed in the NPC2G58T mutant. Thus, the relative impairment of LXR-mediated gene regulation correlates with the severity of the biochemical phenotype in NPC mutants. Production of LDL Cholesterol-derived Oxysterols Is Defective in NPC Mutants—Taken together, the failure to suppress SREBP-dependent gene expression and the impaired LXR-mediated activity in the NPC mutants suggested a possible defect in the generation of endogenous sterol ligands (e.g. LDL-derived cholesterol oxidation products) or in the trafficking of such ligands to their site of action. To test whether oxysterol production is deficient in NPC fibroblasts, we measured the concentration of 25-HC and 27-HC in conditioned medium and cell lipid extracts from LDL fed normal fibroblasts, and NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T mutants using GC/MS (Fig. 5A). We specifically examined the production of these cholesterol metabolites, since they are the predominant oxysterols produced by skin fibroblasts (32Axelson M. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15102-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), they are potent suppressors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (33Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. J. Biol.

In NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T mutants, LDL-stimulated production of 25-HC is decreased by 34 and 77%, respectively, as compared with normal fibroblasts (Fig. 5B). LDL-stimulated production of 27-HC is decreased by 66 and 86% in the NPC1I1061T and NPC2G58T mutants, respectively. Because 25-HC and 27-HC, in contrast to 5,6- and 7-oxygenated sterols, are not major auto-oxidation products, it is unlikely that the oxysterols detected by GC/MS analysis were generated non-enzymatically during the oxysterol isolation procedure (37Lund E. Bjorkhem I. Acc. Chem Res. 1995; 28: 241-249Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Cellular homeostasis requires the regulated entry and exit of a multitude of compounds across the plasma membrane. Cells must take up specific amounts of nutrients, metabolic precursors, inorganic ions, signaling molecules, and other macromolecules while also exporting signaling molecules, hormones, electrolytes, metabolic waste products, and xenobiotics. Recent studies have described some of the genes involved in these transport processes; however, it is clear that many other genes and gene products remain to be identified and characterized (1Saier M.H.

Using a comparative approach, a novel type of organic solute and steroid transporter was recently identified in the liver of an evolutionarily ancient vertebrate, the little skate Raja erinacea (8Wang W. Seward D.J. Li L. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast to all other organic anion carriers, this skate transporter is generated by co-expression of two distinct and novel gene products, Ostα and Ostβ. 1The abbreviations used are: Ost/OST, organic solute transporter; hOSTα, human OSTα; mOSTα, mouse OSTα; sOstα, skate Ostα; ORF, open reading frame; TM, transmembrane; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; SNAP, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP-25 receptor.1The abbreviations used are: Ost/OST, organic solute transporter; hOSTα, human OSTα; mOSTα, mouse OSTα; sOstα, skate Ostα; ORF, open reading frame; TM, transmembrane; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; SNAP, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP-25 receptor. Substrates for this multispecific transporter include estrone 3-sulfate, taurocholate, digoxin, and prostaglandin E2. Interestingly, the overall predicted membrane topology of skate Ostα-Ostβ is similar to that of the heterodimeric sensory rhodopsins, suggesting that Ostα-Ostβ may have evolved from an ancestral rhodopsin-like molecule but has acquired the ability to transport steroids and eicosanoids, compounds that also function as ligands for some G-protein-coupled receptors. Initially, Ostα and Ostβ orthologues were not identified in the human genome or in any other sequenced genomes, indicating that these genes might be specific to marine elasmobranchs. However, sequences for hypothetical human and mouse proteins have recently been entered into the data bases that exhibit 25–41% predicted amino acid sequence identity with skate Ostα and Ostβ (see “Results”). The present study tested whether these mammalian genes are expressed, whether they encode for orthologues of the skate gene products, and if so, whether they functionally complement the transport activity of one another. Materials and Animals—[G-3H]Taurocholic acid (3.47 Ci/mmol), [3H]estrone 3-sulfate (53 Ci/mmol), [G-3H]digoxin (19 Ci/mmol), [3H]prostaglandin E2 (200 Ci/mmol), [3H]estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide (50 Ci/mmol), and p-[glycyl-2-3H]aminohippuric acid (4.08 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma or J. T. Baker Inc. Molecular biology reagents were purchased from Invitrogen; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA; Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA; Qiagen, Valencia, CA; Origene, Rockville, MD; Ambion, Austin, TX; and Promega, Madison, WI. Mature Xenopus laevis were purchased from Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI. Animals were maintained under a constant light cycle at a room temperature of 18 °C. Cloning Strategy—A multistep RT-PCR-based strategy was employed to obtain cDNAs for the putative open reading frames (ORFs) of hypothetical proteins OSTα (GenBank™/EBI accession number CAC51162), OSTβ (GenBank™/EBI accession number XP_058693), and mOSTβ (GenBank™/EBI accession number XP_134984/AY279396). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to generate ORFs for each gene based on the cDNA sequences listed on GenBank™ (Table I). RT-PCR products of predicted sizes were created for putative hOSTα, hOSTβ, and mOstβ using either human or mouse liver poly(A)+ RNA as a template (Clontech). The reaction products were isolated via agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the pCR-II TOPO vector (Invitrogen) utilizing Invitrogen's TOPO TA cloning kit. The resulting plasmids were used to transform DH5α Escherichia coli, from which positive clones were selected for ampicillin resistance and blue/white staining. Upon isolation and identification, a single clone expressing the new plasmid was used as a template in a PCR with primers designed to generate a final product flanked by two unique restriction sites (Table I). Following isolation and enzymatic digestion, the cDNAs with sticky ends were directionally ligated into the pSP64 poly(A) vector. These plasmids then were used to transform DH5α E. coli, and positive clones were selected for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid purifications were completed using Promega's DNA Wizard kit.Table IPrimer sequences used to clone and quantify human and mouse Ostα-Ostβ The cDNA for the hypothetical mOstα (GenBank™/EBI accession numbers BC024441.1 and AAH25912) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC #6994476). This clone was used as a template in a PCR to generate the ORF for GenBank™ sequence BC024441.1. The primers were designed to add a HindIII site to the 5′ end and an XbaI site to the 3′ end of the PCR product (Table I). The PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band of expected size (1060 bp) was excised and enzymatically digested with HindIII and XbaI. The resulting cDNA sequence was then directionally cloned into the pSP64 poly(A) vector and used to transform DH5α E. coli. A positive clone was selected, and the plasmid was isolated with Promega's DNA Wizard miniprep kit. Final clones for all four genes were sequenced in both directions with a series of specific oligonucleotide primers at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory DNA Sequencing Core (Salsbury Cove, ME) to confirm sequence identity. The plasmids were then linearized with EcoRI and used to synthesize cRNA via Ambion's mMessage mMachine kit for injection into Xenopus oocytes. Real Time Quantitative PCR to Determine Tissue Distribution and Expression Levels of hOSTα and hOSTβ in 19 Human Tissue cDNAs—Human tissue cDNAs were purchased from Origene (human Sure-RACE™ panel). Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify portions of hOSTα, hOSTβ, and human β-actin for use in quantitative real time PCR (Table I). Reactions were conducted and analyzed on a Roto-Gene 2000 real time light cycler from Corbett Research (Phenix Corporation, Hayward, CA). Qiagen's QuantiTect Sybr Green quantitative RT-PCR kit was used for PCR analysis. Expression levels are reported as a ratio to β-actin within each tissue examined. Xenopus Oocyte Preparation, Microinjection, and Transport Assays— Isolation of Xenopus oocytes was performed as described by Goldin (9Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and employed previously in our laboratory (10Ballatori N. Wang W. Li L. Truong A.T. Am. J.

Stage V and VI defolliculated oocytes were selected and incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The oocyte medium was changed daily, and healthy oocytes, defined as those with a clean brown animal pole and a distinct equator line, were selected for experiments. Transport studies were performed as described previously (10Ballatori N. Wang W. Li L. Truong A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R1156-R1162PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J.

DNA Sequence and Hydropathy Analysis—Double-stranded cDNA clones were sequenced in both directions at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory DNA Sequencing Core. The full-length sequences for all clones were obtained using synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Sequence analysis was performed with the DNA and protein sequence analysis program Lasergene from DNAStar Inc. (Madison, WI). Membrane topology and putative membrane-spanning domains were determined by hidden Markov model analysis (www.enzim.hu/hmmtop) and by Kyte Doolittle hydropathy analysis (13Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). The presence of possible signal peptides was evaluated with the SignalP V1.1 program (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/). Synthesis of FLAG Epitope-tagged Skate and Human OSTα and of c-MYC-tagged Skate and Human OSTβ—The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was added in-frame to the 3′ end of skate and human OSTα cDNA, and the c-MYC epitope (EQKLISEEDL) was added to the 3′ end of skate and human OSTβ cDNA. Constructs were created via PCR using skate and human OSTα and OSTβ cDNA as templates with oligonucleotide primers containing the FLAG or c-MYC sequences flanked by unique restriction sites. PCR products of predicted size were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified with Qiagen's agarose gel purification kit. The isolated fragments were subcloned into the pSP64 poly(A) vector, and that vector was used to transform DH5α E. coli. Positive clones were grown and plasmid DNA isolated using Promega's DNA Wizard plasmid isolation kit. After restriction digestion and sequencing to establish clone identity, cRNA was prepared for each of the four constructs using Ambion's mMessage mMachine kit. Immunofluorescence Labeling of Intact Oocytes—Intact Xenopus oocytes on day 3 after cRNA injection were fixed in methanol:acetone (1:1) for 10 min on ice, followed by four washes of 5 min each at room temperature and an overnight wash at 4 °C in antibody dilution buffer (0.01 m PBS + 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum, and 0.01% sodium azide). Oocytes were washed at room temperature with 1× PBS + 1% Tween 20 for 1 h with 10-min buffer changes followed by a 15-min incubation in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin in antibody dilution buffer). Oocytes were then washed with 1× PBS + 1% Tween 20 for another 1 h with 10-min buffer changes followed by an overnight wash at 4 °C. The oocytes were incubated with either anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma; 4.9 mg/ml, diluted 1:200 with antibody dilution buffer) or monoclonal anti-c-MYC Cy3-conjugated antibody (Sigma; 1.2 mg/ml, diluted 1:100 with antibody dilution buffer) for 1 h. To remove excess antibody, oocytes were washed in 1× PBS + 1% Tween 20 three times for 5 min each, two times for 10 min each, and then overnight. The oocytes labeled with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody were incubated with an Alexa fluor 488 F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse antibody in the dark for 1 h (Molecular Probes; 2 mg/ml, diluted 1:200). Secondary antibody was removed by washing the oocytes with 1× PBS + 1% Tween 20 three times for 5 min each, two times for 10 min each, and then overnight. Cells were imaged using a ×10 objective on a Leica TCS-SP laser-scanning confocal microscope. Statistical Analysis—Kinetic data from experiments measuring uptake of radiolabeled substrate were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear least squares regression analysis. V max and K m values with standard errors were derived from these curves. Comparison of data measuring initial rates of uptake of radiolabeled substrates in the presence and absence of inhibitors was performed by unpaired Student's t test and correlated to p < 0.05. Cloning Putative Human OSTα and OSTβ and Mouse Ostα and Ostβ—Hypothetical human and mouse proteins (GenBank™/EBI accession numbers CAC51162 and AAH25912, respectively) that were recently added to the data bases exhibit 41% predicted amino acid identity with skate Ostα and share 83% amino acid identity with each other (Fig. 1). Because of the many conserved amino acid substitutions, the extent of amino acid similarity is ∼70% between skate Ostα and these putative mammalian orthologues and 89% between the hypothetical mouse and human proteins (Fig. 1). Interestingly, all three deduced amino acid sequences share a highly unusual cluster of cysteine residues in a predicted hydrophilic cytosolic loop between transmembrane (TM) domains 3 and 4 (Fig. 1). This relatively high overall amino acid identity along with the conserved cysteine cluster in the human, mouse, and skate gene products suggests that they are functional orthologues. Likewise, possible human and mouse orthologues of skate Ostβ were recently entered into the data bases, but these sequences exhibit only 25–29% predicted amino acid identity with skate Ostβ (Fig. 2). The hypothetical human protein with GenBank™ sequence XP_058693 and the hypothetical mouse protein with GenBank™ sequence XP_134984/AY279396 exhibit 25 and 29% predicted amino acid identity with skate Ostβ, respectively (Fig. 2). These hypothetical human and mouse proteins exhibit 62.5% amino acid identity with each other, both encoding for proteins containing 128 amino acids with a putative single TM domain (Fig. 2). An RT-PCR-based strategy was employed to obtain cDNAs for the predicted ORFs of putative human OSTα and OSTβ using human liver mRNA and of putative mouse Ostβ using mouse liver mRNA. The cDNA for the putative mouse Ostα was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC #6994476). Sequence analysis of the synthesized cDNAs for the four genes indicated that both mouse clones were identical to GenBank™ sequences, whereas the human sequences varied by a single nucleotide in the reading frame of each gene. Both differences in the human gene sequences result in amino acid substitutions (Figs. 1 and 2; GenBank™/EBI accession numbers AY194243 and AY194242). It is unclear whether the observed differences are due to polymorphisms or whether they result from mutations introduced during PCR. They are unlikely to be sequence artifacts as both occur in regions of strong sequence data. When compared with the published human genomic DNA data base (www.ncbi.nlm.hih.gov:80/BLAST/), our human OSTα sequence matches perfectly, whereas the GenBank™ cDNA sequence for the protein with GenBank™/EBI accession number CAC51162 contains an adenine at the base in question rather than a guanine (position 604 of the ORF). This difference predicts a valine at position 202 of human OSTα (circled in Fig. 1), whereas the GenBank™ sequence CAC51162 predicts an isoleucine. In contrast, our human OSTβ sequence differs from the genomic DNA sequence at the base in question, containing a cytosine at nucleotide 197 of the ORF instead of an adenine. As a result, the sequence for human OSTβ obtained in the present study predicts a threonine at position 66 (circled in Fig. 2), whereas the GenBank™ sequence XP_058693 predicts a lysine. Because the human liver poly(A)+ RNA used as a template for RT-PCR in the present study was pooled from four different people, the reaction product containing the inserts used for cloning human OSTβ was sequenced. Upon analysis it was determined that an equal distribution of adenine and cytosine occurred at this nucleotide position (data not shown), indicating that this may be a naturally existing polymorphism. A search of the human genomic data base (www.ncbi.nlm.hih.gov:80/BLAST/) revealed that human OSTα is located on chromosome 3 and is coded by nine exons in the 3q29 region, whereas human OSTβ is on chromosome 15 and is coded by four exons located in the 15q21 region. Mouse Ostα is located on chromosome 16 and is coded by nine exons at 16B2, whereas mouse Ostβ is found on chromosome 9 and is coded by four exons located at 9C. The Human and Mouse Proteins Function as Organic Solute Transporters—To assess whether the human and mouse proteins function as organic solute transporters, uptake of [3H]estrone 3-sulfate was measured in X. laevis oocytes injected with cRNA synthesized from the human, mouse, or skate genes. As expected, co-expression of skate Ostα and Ostβ was required to generate transport activity (Fig. 3A) (8Wang W. Seward D.J. Li L. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When the putative human OSTα and mouse OSTα were expressed individually in oocytes, no transport activity was detected (Fig. 3A); however, when these proteins were co-expressed with skate Ostβ, a strong transport signal was obtained (Fig. 3A), indicating that human OSTα and mouse OSTα can functionally complement the corresponding skate protein. Likewise, human OSTβ and mouse OSTβ did not induce transport activity when expressed individually in oocytes but generated a functional transporter when co-expressed with skate Ostα (Fig. 3B). Thus, the human and mouse proteins not only are functional orthologues of the skate proteins but also are able to complement each other across species. Moreover, co-expression of the two human (OSTα-OSTβ) or the two mouse (mOSTα-mOSTβ) proteins generated a very strong transport signal, as did the human-mouse α-β pairs (Fig. 3C). Characteristics of Human OSTα-OSTβ- and Mouse OSTα-OSTβ-mediated Transport—Oocytes injected with human OSTα and OSTβ cRNA (1 ng each) or with mouse Ostα and Ostβ cRNA (1 ng each) were able to transport taurocholate, estrone 3-sulfate, digoxin, and prostaglandin E2 but not estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide or p-aminohippurate (Fig. 4), indicating that this transport system is multispecific and that it may participate in cellular uptake of conjugated steroids and eicosanoids. This substrate profile is similar to that of skate Ostα-Ostβ (8Wang W. Seward D.J. Li L. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The skate, mouse, and human transporters shared a number of other features as well. Transport was sodium-independent (Fig. 5), saturable (Fig. 6), and inhibited by bile salts, steroids, and other organic anions (Table II). Replacement of the NaCl in the oocyte incubation medium with either choline chloride or lithium chloride had no effect on estrone 3-sulfate uptake (Fig. 5), indicating that transport is not coupled to the sodium electrochemical gradient. Initial rates of estrone 3-sulfate uptake into human OSTα-OSTβ- or mouse OSTα-OSTβ-expressing oocytes were saturable, although the apparent Michaelis constants (K m) were relatively high (320 ± 30 μm and 290 ± 24 μm, respectively; Fig. 6). The K m for estrone 3-sulfate uptake by skate Ostα-Ostβ is lower (85 μm) (8Wang W. Seward D.J. Li L. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Uptake of [3H]estrone 3-sulfate in hOSTα-hOSTβ- and mOSTα-mOSTβ-expressing oocytes was inhibited by a variety of bile salts, steroids, and other organic anions (Table II). As reported previously for skate Ostα-Ostβ (8Wang W. Seward D.J. Li L. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), [3H]estrone 3-sulfate uptake was inhibited by sulfated steroids, including lithocholic acid sulfate and taurolithocholic acid sulfate (Table II).Fig. 6Concentration dependence of [3H]estrone 3-sulfate uptake in oocytes expressing human OSTα-OSTβ or mouse OSTα-OSTβ Oocytes were injected with water, 1 ng of hOSTα cRNA plus 1 ng of hOSTβ cRNA (panel A) or 1 ng of mOstα cRNA plus 1 ng of mOstβ cRNA (panel B).

Open table in a new tab Tissue Distribution of Human OSTα and OSTβ mRNA— OSTα and OSTβ mRNA levels were measured in 19 human tissue cDNAs and were expressed relative to β-actin mRNA levels using quantitative real time PCR analysis. The results revealed that OSTα and OSTβ are widely expressed in human tissues (Fig. 7). Tissues that had high levels of OSTα mRNA generally also had high levels of OSTβ mRNA, indicating coexpression of these genes. Relatively high levels of both mRNAs were found in testis, colon, liver, small intestine, kidney, ovary, and adrenal gland (Fig. 7A); and lower levels were measured in heart, lung, brain, pituitary, thyroid gland, uterus, prostate, mammary gland, and fat (Fig. 7B). The mRNA for OSTα and OSTβ was below our limit of detection in skeletal muscle and peripheral blood leukocytes (data not shown). Trafficking of OSTα and OSTβ to the Plasma Membrane—To gain insight into the mechanism by which OSTα and OSTβ interact to generate a functional transporter, epitope-tagged constructs were synthesized, and these constructs were tested for functional activity (Fig. 8) and cellular localization (Fig. 9) in Xenopus oocytes. The FLAG epitope was added in-frame to the 3′ end of skate and human OSTα cDNA, and the c-MYC epitope was added to the 3′ end of skate and human OSTβ cDNA. As expected, there was no transport activity when the individual epitope-tagged proteins were expressed in oocytes; however, when human or skate α-FLAG and β-c-MYC were co-expressed, there was strong estrone 3-sulfate transport activity (Fig. 8). Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that OSTα-FLAG and OSTβ-c-MYC were able to reach the plasma membrane when expressed either individually or in pairs (Fig. 9). Thus, the inability of the individual proteins to generate transport activity does not appear to be due to impaired trafficking to the cell surface.Fig. 9Immunofluorescence detection of epitope-tagged skate Ostα-Ostβ or human OSTα-OSTβ in Xenopus oocytes. The FLAG epitope was added to skate Ostα and human OSTα, and the c-MYC epitope was added to skate Ostβ and human OSTβ cDNA. cRNA prepared from these four constructs was injected into oocytes either individually (A and B, skate Ostα-FLAG; C and D, human OSTα-FLAG; E and F, skate Ostβ-c-MYC; and G and H, human OSTβ-c-MYC) or as α-β pairs for each species (I and J for skate and K and L for human). Oocytes were labeled either with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and visualized by an Alexa fluor 488 F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse antibody (A, E, and I for skate; C, G, and K for human) or with a monoclonal anti-c-MYC Cy3-conjugated antibody (B, F, and J for skate; D, H, and L for human).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download"

Here, we have initiated these steps in isolated mitochondria derived from control and BCL-2-overexpressing cells using synthetic BH3 peptides and subsequently analyzed the BCL members by chemical cross-linking. The results show that the BH3 domain of BID interacts with and induces an “open” conformation of BAK, exposing the BAK N terminus. This open (activated) conformer of BAK potently induces oligomerization of non-activated (“closed”) conformers, causing a cascade of BAK auto-oligomerization. Induction of the open conformation of BAK occurs even in the presence of excess BCL-2, but BCL-2 selectively interacts with this open conformer and blocks BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release, dependent on the ratio of BID BH3 and BCL-2. This mechanism of inhibition by BCL-2 also occurs in intact cells stimulated with Fas or expressing tBID. Although BID BH3 interacts with both BCL-2 and BAK, the results indicate that when BCL-2 is in excess it can sequester the BID BH3-induced activated conformer of BAK, effectively blocking downstream events. This model suggests that the primary mechanism for BCL-2 blockade targets activated BAK rather than sequestering tBID.

This model suggests that the primary mechanism for BCL-2 blockade targets activated BAK rather than sequestering tBID. Recent genetic analysis of mammalian programmed cell death indicates that many death signals depend on the multidomain pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family, BAX and BAK, to effect the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, including release of the Apaf-1 co-factor, cytochrome c, to the cytosol, initiating a caspase cascade (1Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar). BAX and BAK, however, differ in their initial cellular location, with BAK primarily constitutively integrated into the lipid bilayer of membranes including the mitochondrial outer membrane. BAX, on the other hand, typically resides in the cytosol or is loosely associated with membrane surfaces (2Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J.

After a death stimulus, BAX undergoes conformational changes including exposure of its N terminus and functional activation of its C-terminal membrane anchor, which correlate with integration of the protein into the mitochondrial outer membrane (3Goping I.S.

In this location, stimulated BAX assumes higher order oligomeric structures, resulting in cytochrome c release from the organelle (9Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Google Scholar). Although lacking the initial step of regulated insertion into mitochondrial membrane, constitutively integrated BAK likewise responds to multiple death stimuli by forming oligomers in the membrane (10Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar). BAX and BAK likely cooperate with lipid components of the outer membrane to effect protein egress from the organelle (11Degli Esposti M. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 433-440Google Scholar, 12Epand R.F.

A second pro-apoptotic sub-group of the BCL-2 family, the BH3 domain-only members, couples upstream death signals to downstream activation of BAX/BAK (for review, see Ref. 14Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Google Scholar). Genes for some of these BH3 only proteins respond to transcriptional cues, yielding the active entity (e.g. Noxa, PUMA, and BIK) (15Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T.

Others, however, are constitutively expressed and undergo an activating conformational change in response to a death stimulus (e.g. BAD, BIM, and BID) (19Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar), which is predicted to make available the BH3 helix. BID is cleaved by caspase-8 to tBID after death receptor stimulation and moves to mitochondria, where it interacts with and induces oligomerization of BAX and BAK (9Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Google Scholar, 10Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar, 24Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 1: 53-63Google Scholar). Although direct interactions between most other BH3 domain-only members and either BAX or BAK have not been reported, BH3-only members such as BAD also stimulate BAX/BAK as the death effectors (25Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Google Scholar, 26Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Google Scholar) by binding BCL-2 and sensitizing BAX/BAK to other stimuli, including tBID itself (27Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 183-192Google Scholar). Multidomain BCL proteins contain a deep groove formed by BH1 and BH2, which accepts the BH3 domain of a binding partner (28Minn A.J. Kettlun C.S. Liang H. Kelekar A. Vander Heiden M.G. Chang B.S. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 632-643Google Scholar). In instances where anti-apoptotic BCL-2/BCL-XL is in excess, one model holds that these members bind to and sequester BH3-only proteins via their exposed BH3 helix, preventing them from stimulating the BAX/BAK effectors (25Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Google Scholar). Another model suggests that BH3-only proteins bind anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, preventing them from inhibiting the BAX/BAK effectors (26Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Google Scholar). A third model, proposed on the basis of the anti-apoptotic function of adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein, argues that the protein preferentially binds and inhibits a conformationally altered form of BAX in cells after receipt of a death stimulus (24Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 1: 53-63Google Scholar). Which of these pathways dominates may in fact depend on the 3-way relative expression levels of anti-apoptotic BCL members, pro-apoptotic BAX, BAK, and the active BH3-only entities that initiate mitochondrial apoptosis. A recent study suggests a two-step mechanism for mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in response to tBID; that is, BH3-independent mobilization of intra-cristae cytochrome c stores and a BH3-dependent egress of cytochrome c from the organelle associated with BH3-stimulated oligomerization of BAK (29Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Google Scholar). Documentation of this latter step accompanied by findings from mutagenesis in which the tBID mitochondrial targeting sequence was replaced with that of BCL-2 argue that simple concentration of the tBID BH3 domain at the surface of mitochondria is sufficient to initiate BAK oligomerization in the outer membrane (10Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar). Furthermore, generation of tBID by caspase cleavage involves exposure of its BH3 domain (30McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Google Scholar, 31Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Google Scholar) and a freely diffusing synthetic peptide corresponding to the tBID BH3 domain stimulates BAK oligomerization in the mitochondrial outer membrane and release of cytochrome c (27Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 183-192Google Scholar). Use of the isolated BH3 domain in the form of a pure oligopeptide offers certain advantages, such as biotinylation and directional cross-linking, for probing directly the molecular interactions that mediate these BH3-dependent events. Outstanding issues, for example, relate to the nature of the BAK oligomerization pathway itself and the opposing roles of tBID and BCL-2 in its regulation. Here, we have utilized derivatized oligo-peptides corresponding to the entire helix 3 of BID to study these questions and find that this BH3-containing peptide binds BAK, resulting in exposure of the BAK N terminus. This open conformer of BAK itself potently induces oligomerization of non-activated (closed) BAK members in the outer membrane, indicative of an amplification cascade. BCL-2, at levels that block cytochrome c egress from mitochondria, does not interfere with binding of BID BH3 to BAK or induction of the open conformer of BAK, but it selectively interacts with the tBID BH3-stimulated (open) BAK conformer, inhibiting BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release. General—Isolation of cytosol and mitochondria, SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates or cell fractions, transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose filters, development of blots with antibodies and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence, and assays to measure the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria have been documented in earlier publications (3Goping I.S.

Both are biotinylated at their N termini and contain an Arg to Lys substitution at position 88 and an amide in place of a carboxyl at the C terminus. The mutant peptide also contains a Leu to Gly substitution at position 90. The corresponding wild-type BAD and BIK BH3 peptides were also synthesized. All peptides were purified (>95%) by high performance liquid chromatography. BAK Translation Products—Two separate BAK constructs were engineered for in vitro assays, both of which contain a FLAG epitope at their N termini. FLAG-BAK-ΔN(C to A) has a deletion of the N-terminal 36 amino acids and a substitution of its single Cys to Ala at position 166. FLAG-BAK(C to A) comprises full-length BAK with substitutions of both of its Cys residues at positions 14 and 166 to Ala. The constructs were cloned into pcDNA3.1 and in vitro transcribed and translated using the TNT® rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's protocol for non-radiolabeled translations. Release of Cytochrome c from Mitochondria—Mitochondria (50 μg of protein in 25 μl of cMRM (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm ATP(K+), 5 mm sodium succinate, 0.08 mm ADP, 2 mm K2HPO4)) isolated from control (HA-BCL-2) KB or from KB cells overexpressing HA-BCL-2 (39Nguyen M.

Alternatively, the mitochondria were incubated with recombinant tBID (in 5 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) (22Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar), synthetic BH3 peptides (in 5 μl of 0.5 mm Pipes, pH 6), BAK translation product, or control buffer (0.5 mm Pipes, pH 6), adjusted to a final volume of 50 μl with HIM, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (3Goping I.S.

The reaction mixtures were then centrifuged at 9000 rpm (Sorvall MC 12V), and equivalent aliquots of both the supernatants and pellets (resuspended to the same volume as the supernatant) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using the mouse monoclonal anti-pigeon cytochrome c antibody 7H8.2C12 (Pharmingen). BAK Oligomerization—Reactions were conducted as for release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, except that the mitochondria (50 μg) that were recovered at the end of the reaction were resuspended in 47.5 μl of HIM. Subsequently, 2.5 μl of Me2SO (control) or 2.5 μl of a solution of bismaleimidohexane (BMH) (Pierce) in Me2SO were added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (Sorvall MC 12V), and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acids 23–37 of human BAK (Upstate). Treatment of BAK with Trypsin—5 μl of MRM (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing trypsin (0.125 mg/ml, Sigma) and 5 μl of MRM with (mock) or without chymotrypsin-trypsin inhibitor (1.25 mg/ml, Sigma) were added directly to reaction mixtures, which were then incubated on ice for 20 min. The trypsin digestion was stopped by the subsequent addition of 5 μl of the inhibitor, the mitochondria were recovered at 9000 rpm (Sorvall MC 12V) for 5 min through a cushion of MRM, and BAK was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot as above. Directional Cross-linking—Biotinylated peptides were incubated in the presence of excess succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxy-(6-amidocaproate) (LC-SMCC, 10 mm stock in Me2SO, Pierce), an amine/sulfhydryl hetero-bifunctional cross-linker, for 1 h at room temperature The amine reactive group on any excess cross-linker was then quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8, to a final concentration of 350 mm followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. The derivatized peptides were then added to 50-μl standard reaction mixtures containing mitochondria. After 1 h at 37 °C, the mitochondria were recovered and solubilized in 200 μl of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Immunopure® immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) were then added, and the mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were recovered, washed, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed for BAK or BCL-2 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using anti-BAK or the monoclonal hamster anti-human BCL-2 antibody 6C8 (Biomol). Immunoprecipitation—Mitochondria from HA-BCL-2-overexpressing cells were incubated in standard cross-linking reactions in the absence of detergent, recovered, and solubilized in 200 μl of RIPA buffer. The monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody 16B12 (Berkeley Antibody Co.) was then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the samples and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed and analyzed for the presence of BAK and BCL-2 as above. Analysis of BCL-2 and BAK Interaction in Fas-stimulated KB Cells— Human KB epithelial cells overexpressing HA-BCL-2 were treated with Fas-ligating anti-Fas antibody (0.5 μg of protein/ml; Upstate, CH11), as described (38Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Google Scholar). At the indicated times, mitochondria were isolated, aliquots (100 μg protein) were treated with the cross-linker BMH, HA-Bcl-2 was recovered after protein dissolution in RIPA buffer with anti-HA, and precipitates were analyzed with antibodies against BCL-2 and BAK as described above. Transfection and Immunofluorescence—Control and HA-Bcl-2-overexpressing KB cells were plated to 50% confluency on 12-mm coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected overnight with a combination of pEGFP, pIND-tBID-GFP, and pVgRXR (22Li H.

The expression of tBID was then induced by treating the cells with 1 μm ponasterone A (Invitrogen) in growth medium. At the indicated times, the cells were fixed, and immunofluorescence was performed as described in Ruffolo et al. (32Ruffolo S.C. Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Goping I.S. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Li H. Yuan J. Shore G.C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 11: 1101-1108Google Scholar) using either a mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (BD Biosciences, 6H2.B4) or a mouse monoclonal BAK conformation-specific antibody directed to the N terminus of BAK (Oncogene, TC100) as the primary antibody. Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize cytochrome c and the reactive BAK conformation. Transfected cells expressing EGFP were scored for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and for staining of the conformation-specific, exposed BAK N terminus. BAK is a 211-amino acid protein that contains a predicted membrane-anchor sequence toward its C terminus and three of the four BH domains that define membership in the BCL family of apoptosis regulators, BH1–BH3 (Fig. 1A). The protein is constitutively integrated in the outer membrane of mitochondria, facing the cytoplasm, and undergoes oligomerization in response to tBID, which correlates with tBID-induced release of cytochrome c from the organelle (10Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar). As a base line for establishing an in vitro system for studying the responses of mitochondrial BAK to a synthetic BID BH3 peptide (Fig. 1B), we first combined a high speed cytosolic fraction derived from HeLa cells with a heavy membrane fraction enriched in intact mitochondria isolated from KB epithelial cells (3Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Google Scholar). Treatment of the cytosol with caspase-8 generated p15 tBID, which was recovered in the alkaline-insoluble mitochondrial pellet fraction (Fig. 1C). As previously noted (21Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Google Scholar), BCL-2/BCL-XL did not influence the association of tBID with mitochondria, and therefore, the amount of tBID that binds to mitochondria that were derived from cells that do or do not overexpress BCL-2 (see the inset, Fig. 1E) was the same (Fig. 1C). BID BH3 Peptide Recapitulates tBID or the Treatment of Cytosol with Caspase-8 —When the combined cytosol-mitochondria reaction mixtures were subsequently centrifuged to pellet the organelle, cytochrome c was observed in the supernatant only if the cytosol had been treated with caspase-8 (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). Mitochondria isolated from KB cells overexpressing HA-BCL-2, on the other hand, resisted this caspase-8-induced release of cytochrome c (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). As expected, supplementing the HeLa cell cytosol with 0.06 μm recombinant tBID (22Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar, 32Ruffolo S.C. Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Goping I.S. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Li H. Yuan J. Shore G.C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 11: 1101-1108Google Scholar) bypassed the requirement for treatment of the cytosol with caspase-8, and the control mitochondria (HA-BCL-2) effectively released cytochrome c (lane 5). An equivalent 0.06 μm concentration of synthetic peptide corresponding to the 23-amino acid helix 3 of BID, which contains the 15-amino acid BH3 domain (Fig. 1B), also stimulated release of cytochrome c from control mitochondria (lane 6), but concentrations of peptide that were 5–10-fold higher than the equivalent concentration of recombinant tBID were required for a comparable amount of cytochrome c release (compare lane 5 with lanes 6 and 7). This differential is consistent with a membrane-targeting sequence present in tBID but lacking in the synthetic peptide that serves to concentrate tBID at the mitochondria (10Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar). Of note, a mutant peptide in which the highly conserved Leu present in all BH3 domains examined to date (amino acid 90 in BID) was changed to Gly completely abrogated the ability of the BID BH3 peptide to cause cytochrome c release from the organelle (Fig. 1D, lanes 9–11). Also, as expected, cytosol had a negligible effect on the ability of the wt BID BH3 peptide to induce cytochrome c release in this assay (not shown). As anticipated, mitochondria from HA-BCL-2 overexpressing cells (inset, Fig. 1E) resisted the induction of cytochrome c release from the organelle both by recombinant tBID (not shown) and by the synthetic BH3 peptide (Fig. 1E, conducted in the absence of cytosol). This protection by HA-BCL-2, however, could be overcome by increasing the concentration of BH3 peptide (a representative experimental result is shown in Fig. 1E). The ratio of BCL-2 and BH3 peptide, therefore, appears to determine the sensitivity of the mitochondria to cytochrome c release (see also Letai et al. (27Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 183-192Google Scholar)). Mitochondria from cells overexpressing HA-BCL-2 were able to resist the effects of BID BH3 up to about 10 μm peptide (Fig. 1E) and of tBID up to about 1 μm (not shown). A corresponding resistance was also observed toward the ability of the BH3 peptide to induce BAK oligomerization in the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig 2A, compare lanes 3–5 with lanes 10–12), which was visualized as high molecular weight anti-BAK immunoreactive products detected by SDS-PAGE after chemical cross-linking of mitochondria with the sulfhydryl-specific homo-bifunctional BMH (10Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar). Interestingly, at the peptide concentrations used, both BAK oligomerization (Fig. 2A) and cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Fig. 1F) were much more responsive to the BID BH3 peptide compared with BH3 peptides of similar size and design derived from BAD and BIK (see also Letai et al. (27Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 183-192Google Scholar)). This may reflect the observation that among BH3-only proteins, tBID is unique in that it yields detectable interactions with pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK (33Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 12: 1166-1173Google Scholar). BID BH3 Interacts with BAK and Induces an Open Conformation, Exposing the BAK N Terminus—Inspection of the BAK sequence reveals the presence of two cysteine residues, the first lying toward the N terminus at amino acid position 14, and the second, at position 166, within the BH2 domain (Fig. 1A). As noted by Wei et al. (10Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Google Scholar), treatment of non-induced mitochondria with BMH results in intramolecular cross-linking of these two cysteine moieties in BAK, generating a BAK species that migrates in SDS-PAGE with a faster mobility than unmodified BAK (double asterisk in Fig. 2A). This intramolecular cross-linked species was lost in mitochondria that were stimulated with the BID BH3 peptide, whereas high molecular weight cross-linked BAK oligomers appeared (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5). A similar pattern was observed in intact cells after Fas stimulation (not shown). Although one explanation is that the cysteine residues in BH3-stimulated BAK preferentially engage in intermolecular cross linking, this explanation does not account for the observation that in the presence of excess BCL-2, BAK oligomerization was inhibited, yet the loss of intramolecular cross-linking was still observed after treatment with the BID BH3 peptide (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12). Another explanation, therefore, is that BH3-stimulated BAK undergoes a change that precludes intramolecular cross-linking between Cys-14 and Cys-166, even in the presence of BCL-2. As shown in Fig. 2B, the addition of wt but not mt BID BH3 peptide to mitochondria caused BAK to undergo a conformational change, in which trypsin-resistant BAK became susceptible to the protease and resulted in loss of reactivity of BAK toward an antibody directed toward the BAK N terminus (amino acids 27–35). This indicates that in its unstimulated form, BAK is in a closed conformation with its N terminus inaccessible (34Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Google Scholar, 35Sundararajan R. Cuconati A. Nelson D. White E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45120-45127Google Scholar), and this corresponds to the form of BAK whose N-terminal Cys is susceptible to intramolecular cross-linking by BMH to the Cys residue within the BH2 helix (Figs. 1A and 2A). Importantly, HA-BCL-2 in excess did not inhibit the ability of either 3.75 μm BID BH3 peptide or 0.15 μm recombinant tBID to induce exposure of the BAK N terminus (Fig. 2B), whereas BCL-2 did inhibit both reagents from inducing BAK oligomerization (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12; not shown) and cytochrome c release (Fig. 1E; not shown). Therefore, BCL-2 blocks tBID-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria downstream of tBID induction of the BAK open (trypsin-sensitive) conformation. The BID BH3-dependent change at the N terminus of BAK correlated with a direct interaction between BAK and the BID BH3 peptide. Such interaction was demonstrated by first covalently attaching the hetero-bifunctional (amino/sulfhydryl) cross-linker, LC-SMCC, to the single Lys residue in the peptide (Fig. 3A). This Lys was introduced in place of Arg-88, which normally resides at this position in the wt sequence. This change did not affect the ability of tBID to induce apoptosis in transfected cells (not shown) and, therefore, was considered to be a silent change. 3.75 μm biotinylated wt or mt (Leu to Gly) peptide-LC-SMCC complex was incubated with mitochondria in the absence of detergent, and covalent adducts to 1 of the 2 Cys residues in BAK (Fig. 1A) were recovered after solubilization and vigorous washing in RIPA buffer containing streptavidin beads. Only the wt biotinylated BH3 peptide formed a covalent complex with BAK (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Of note, BAK-BH3-cross-linked adducts were generated in mitochondria lacking or harboring excess HA-BCL-2 (Fig. 3B, lower panel), indicating that BCL-2 does not interfere with the specific interactions of wt BID BH3 with BAK despite the fact that HA-BCL-2 strongly inhibited BID BH3-induced BAK oligomerization (Fig. 2A) and release of cytochrome c from the organelle (Fig. 1, D and E). Furthermore, this inability of HA-BCL-2 to block interactions of BID BH3 with BAK occurred even though the peptide also interacted with HA-BCL-2 (Fig. 3C). This binding to BCL-2, therefore, does not result in functional sequestration of BID BH3 from BAK and suggests that the binding equilibria at the mitochondrial surface do not favor BH3-BCL-2 interactions. BCL-2 Preferentially Interacts with BID BH3-stimulated BAK—Interactions between BAK and BCL-2 in mitochondria isolated from HA-BCL-2 overexpressing KB cells were assessed by chemical cross-linking with BMH followed by protein dissolution, precipitation with anti-HA, and immunoblotting of precipitates with anti-BAK. It is particularly noteworthy that cross-linking between HA-BCL-2 and BAK above background was not observed in the absence of the BID BH3 stimulation (Fig. 4A). Specific covalent adducts between HA-BCL-2 and BAK were observed, on the other hand, after stimulation with wt but not mt BH3 peptide (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Collectively, therefore, the results show that BID BH3 physically interacts with BAK at the surface of mitochondria (Fig. 3B) and induces a conformational change in which the BAK-N terminus becomes accessible to trypsin (Fig. 2B); BCL-2 preferentially interacts with this BH3-stimulated open conformation of BAK (Fig. 4A) and inhibits BH3-induced BAK oligomerization (Fig. 2A) and cytochrome c release dependent on the ratio of BID BH3 and BCL-2 (Fig. 1E). A Cascade of BAK Auto-oligomerization—Although tBID initiates BAK oligomerization, the mechanism for how this is accomplished is not known. The fact that BID BH3 caused BAK to adopt an open (i.e. trypsin accessible) conformation even in the presence of excess BCL-2 (Fig. 2B) suggests that BCL-2 functions downstream of this step to inhibit both BAK oligomerization (Fig. 2A) and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 1, D and E). One possibility is that the unstimulated (closed) conformation of BAK is incompetent for auto-oligomerization and that BID BH3, by inducing exposure of the N terminus, relieves this barrier. To test this idea, a BAK construct was generated that lacks amino acids 1–36 (FLAG-ΔN-BAK, see Fig. 1A), and its ability to induce oligomerization of endogenous BAK in isolated mitochondria was assessed. Because oligomerization is assayed by cross-linking with the Cys-specific homo-bifunctional BMH cross-linker, both the full-length and ΔN-BAK constructs that were used as the “donor” proteins were further modified to change their constituent Cys residues to Ala (Fig. 1A). In this way, the donor BAK molecules cannot be visualized as part of the oligomeric complex, whereas oligomerization of endogenous “acceptor” BAK molecules can. As documented in Fig. 4B, the transcription-translation product of FLAG-ΔN-BAK(C to A) stimulated oligomerization of endogenous mitochondrial BAK and release of cytochrome c from the organelle, whereas full-length FLAG-BAK(C to A) did not. The latter construct, as expected, was resistant to degradation of its N terminus by trypsin (Fig. 4B, right panel). Furthermore, mitochondria containing excess HA-BCL-2 (Fig. 1, C–E, and 2A) resisted BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release in response to FLAG-ΔN-BAK(C to A) (not shown). Because the antibody that was used to detect BAK oligomers recognizes the BAK N terminus, which is lacking in the FLAG-ΔN-BAK(C to A) translation product, the observed oligomers must have derived from the endogenous population of mitochondrial BAK. BCL-2 Selectively Interacts with Death-stimulated BAK in Intact Cells—The results presented in Fig. 5 show that the key findings presented above utilizing isolated mitochondria in vitro can be recapitulated in intact human KB epithelial cells stimulated with tBID or Fas ligation. tBID-initiated changes in BAK conformation and cytochrome c distribution was achieved by co-transfecting a vector expressing EGFP and a vector conditionally expressing tBID under the control of an inducible promoter (22Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar, 32Ruffolo S.C. Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Goping I.S. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Li H. Yuan J. Shore G.C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 11: 1101-1108Google Scholar). After induction of tBID expression with ponasterone A, EGFP-positive cells were probed by immunofluorescence using an antibody against cytochrome c and an antibody directed to the N terminus of BAK; the latter selectively recognizes a specific conformation of BAK with an exposed N terminus (34Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, left panel, tBID induced the release of cytochrome c in control cells but not in cells overexpressing HA-BCL-2 (see the inset, Fig. 1E). Excess BCL-2 had no effect, however, on the ability of tBID to activate the conformationally altered BAK with the exposed N terminus (Fig. 5, A and B, right panel), consistent with the findings in vitro that BCL-2 functions downstream of the tBID-induced activated conformer of BAK to restrict loss of cytochrome c from the organelle (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the previous finding that BID BH3 peptide induces BAK/BCL-2 interaction in isolated mitochondria (Fig. 4A) argues that these interactions occur in the presence but not absence of cell death stimuli that are coupled to BID. To test this, KB cells overexpressing HA-BCL-2 were stimulated for 0, 2, or 3 h with agonistic anti-Fas antibody, and the mitochondria were isolated and subjected to cross-linking with BMH, after which proteins were dissolved in RIPA buffer and subjected to BCL-2 pull down with anti-HA, and the precipitates were probed by immunoblot with antibody against BCL-2 or BAK. HA-BCL-2/BAK heterodimers were observed after but not before stimulation of the cells by Fas ligation (Fig. 5C). Concluding Remarks—Altogether, the findings presented here suggest a model (Fig. 6) in which the BAK N terminus represses the ability of unstimulated BAK to undergo spontaneous self-oligomerization in the mitochondrial outer membrane. By binding to BAK, the BID BH3 domain overcomes this barrier. Furthermore, the resulting open (N terminus exposed) BAK conformer can induce oligomerization of closed BAK conformers, indicative of a BID BH3-initiated cascade of BAK auto-oligomerization and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. BCL-2 preferentially interacts with the BID BH3-induced open conformer of BAK, blocking this cascade. This model might also extend to BAX since the adenovirus BCL-2 member, the E1B 19-kDa protein, appears to selectively bind the BAX open conformer (8Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Google Scholar, 24Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 1: 53-63Google Scholar, 35Sundararajan R. Cuconati A. Nelson D. White E. J. Biol.

By interacting with the BID BH3-stimulated open BAK conformer, BCL-2 can intercede and inhibit BID BH3 signaling by selectively targeting the initiation step of the BAK oligomerization cascade, consistent with the model proposed for the E1B 19-kDa protein (8Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Google Scholar, 24Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 1: 53-63Google Scholar). Excess BCL-2, at levels that can inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria, does not prevent BID BH3 from binding BAK, indicating that BCL-2, at levels that can inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria, does not sequester BID BH3 nor prevent it from directly activating BAK. Sequestration of BID BH3 by BCL-2, of course, would occur at further elevated BCL-2, where BCL-2 is sufficiently in excess relative to BAK that it represents an overwhelming sink for tBID (25Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Google Scholar). Conversely, the fact that BID BH3 in excess can bind to both BAK and BCL-2, however, suggests a two-step mechanism for BID BH3-induced oligomerization of BAK; interaction of BID BH3 with BAK to induces the open conformation and interaction with BCL-2 to prevent BCL-2 from binding and inhibiting this active BAK conformer (Fig. 6). Consistent with this idea, subsequent BAK oligomerization and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is dependent on the ratio of pro-apoptotic BID BH3 and anti-apoptotic BCL-2. Moreover, this model suggests that BH3-only proteins that interact with BCL-2 but not with BAK may require a co-stimulus to induce the open BAK conformer to initiate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (27Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 183-192Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies (13Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Google Scholar) suggest that the critical path for BAX-dependent egress of macromolecules such as cytochrome c across a membrane lipid bilayer can be reconstituted by combining just BAX and tBID in the appropriate lipid environment. Likewise, mitochondria isolated from cellular homogenates, such as those described here, are also responsive. It must be emphasized, however, that in intact cells undergoing apoptotic transitions, barriers that help to maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial network are probably removed by parallel pathways. For example, important transformations have been identified that sensitize mitochondria to a BH3-only hit, such as tBID, including mitochondrial fission and fragmentation induced by endoplasmic reticulum calcium-mediated pathways (37Breckenridge D.G. Marcellus R.C. Stojanovic M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1115-1127Google Scholar).

We now report prevalent activation of transcription factor Stat5 in human prostate cancer and provide novel evidence that blocking activation of Stat5 in human prostate cancer cells leads to extensive cell death. Specifically, Stat5 was activated in 65% of human prostate cancer specimens examined based on nuclear location of tyrosine phosphorylated Stat5. Adenoviral gene delivery of a dominant-negative Stat5 mutant (DNStat5), but not wild-type Stat5, induced cell death of both the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell line CWR22Rv and the androgen-sensitive LnCap cell line. Endogenous Stat5 was active in both CWR22Rv and LnCap cells. In contrast, only low levels of inactive Stat5 proteins were detected in the PC-3 cell line, which correlated with resistance to DNStat5-induced cell death. In CWR22Rv and LnCap cells, inhibition of Stat5 by expression of DNStat5 induced apoptotic cell death as judged from morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation with evidence of a caspase-9-dependent mechanism.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5412-5421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an autocrine production of Prl by prostate epithelial cells (1Nevalainen M.T. Valve E.M. Ingleton P.M. Nurmi M. Martikainen P.M.

Chandrashekar V. Bartke A. Grimley P.M. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Rui H. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Stat5 may act as a survival protein in human prostate cancer and that blocking Stat5 function could induce death of prostate cancer cells. We investigated activation of Stat5 in 40 human prostate cancer samples by immunohistochemical analysis using activation state-specific anti-phospho-TyrStat5 antibody. To specifically block Stat5 activity in human prostate cancer cells, we created a dominant-negative mutant of Stat5 (DNStat5) in an adenoviral transfer vector. In this work, we demonstrate that transcription factor Stat5 is activated in a significant number of human prostate cancer specimens and that blocking Stat5 activity induces extensive apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Cell Culture—CWR22Rv, LnCap, and PC-3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biofluids, Gaithersburg, MD), and T47D cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. LnCap cells were cultured in the presence of 1 nm dihydrotestosterone (5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, Sigma). Immunohistochemical Detection of Phosphorylated Stat5 in Human Prostate Cancer—Tissue sections of formalin-fixed prostate cancer samples from 40 patients were immunostained for activated Stat5 as described previously (17Nevalainen M.T. Xie J. Bubendorf L. Wagner K.U. Rui H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1108-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene followed by rehydration in graded alcohol. To unmask the epitopes, the slides were microwave-treated with antigen-retrieval solution AxAR1 (Advantex BioReagents, Conroe, TX) or AxAR2 for use with anti-pTyrStat5 mAb or anti-pan-Stat5 mAb, respectively. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the slides in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, and the tissue sections were incubated in normal goat serum (BioGenex Laboratories Inc., San Ramon, CA) for 2 h to block unspecific binding of immunoglobulins (IgGs). The anti-pTyrStat5 mAb was diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at a final concentration of 0.6 μg/ml (Advantex BioReagents). The anti-pan-Stat5 mAb was used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml (Advantex Bioreagents). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using anti-mouse-biotinylated goat secondary antibody followed by streptavidin-horseradish-peroxidase complex (BioGenex). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine was used as chromogen, and hematoxylin was used as counterstain. For negative controls, parallel slides were immunostained with subtype-specific mouse IgG, and lactating human mammary gland was used as positive control tissue (17Nevalainen M.T. Xie J. Bubendorf L. Wagner K.U. Rui H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1108-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Generation of Adenovirus for Gene Delivery of Dominant-negative and Wild-type Stat5—Expression vector for murine Stat5a (pXM-Stat5a) was kindly provided by Xiuwen Liu and Lothar Hennighausen (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (14Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative variant of Stat5 (Stat5aΔ713) was derived by truncation after amino acid residue Ala-713 of pXM-Stat5a using a PCR fragment generated using 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAGGCATCTGTGGATGCATTG-3′ (antisense) primers followed by EcoRI and XbaI digestion and subcloning into the EcoRI-XbaI-digested pXM-Stat5a. The DNA sequence of the resulting construct pXM-Stat5aΔ713 was verified before use. The ability of our DNStat5 (Stat5aΔ713) expression construct to completely suppress both Stat5a- and Stat5b-mediated transcriptional activation has been reported previously (18Yamashita H. Iwase H. Toyama T. Fujii Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1638-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Replication-defective human adenovirus (Ad5) carrying wild-type Stat5 (WTStat5) or DNStat5 was generated using the AdEasy vector system (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). The open reading frame sequences of DNStat5 and WTStat5 were released from respective plasmids by 1) digestion with EcoRI, 2) blunt-ending by Klenow DNA polymerase, and 3) digestion with HindIII, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the Klenow DNA polymerase bluntended BglII site and the unmodified HindIII site of the pShuttle-CMV transfer vector. Homologous recombination of WTStat5 or DNStat5 transfer vectors with the pAdEasy vector was performed in BJ5183 Escherichia coli by electroporation. Recombined clones were screened by kanamycin-resistant growth and confirmed by PacI digestion to yield two bands of 30 and 4.5 kb. The recombinant viruses were packaged in QBI-293A cells, and resulting clones were selected from plaques and amplified. Expression of WTStat5 and DNStat5 from adenoviral stocks was verified by Western blotting using an anti-pan-Stat5 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Selected recombinant viral stocks were expanded in large scale cultures, purified by double cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, and titered side by side by a standard plaque assay method in QBI-293A cells as per the manufacturer's instructions. Protein Solubilization and Immunoblotting—Pellets of prostate cancer cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 60 min, and insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, the protein concentrations of clarified cell lysates were determined by simplified Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were exposed overnight to primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at the following concentrations: anti-phosphotyrosine-Stat5a/b (Tyr-694/Tyr-699) mAb (1 μg/ml, Advantex BioReagents), anti-pan-Stat5 mAb (1 μg/ml, Transduction Laboratories, Inc.), or polyclonal antiserum to Stat5a (1:3,000) or Stat5b (1:3,000). The blots were washed in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml, Transduction Laboratories). Enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions for antibody detection. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was determined by a calorimetric assay in which a tetrazolium compound is bioreduced by cells into a colored formazan product in direct proportion to the number of living cells in culture (Promega, Madison, WI). Prostate cancer cells were plated on 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well) and infected the next day with different m.o.i. (multiplicities of infection) of adenovirus carrying WTStat5, DNStat5, or lacZ. Cells infected with empty control virus or mock-infected cells served as additional controls. Three days after the infection, the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and the absorbance was recorded at 490 nm. Cell Death ELISA Assay—Fragmentation of DNA after cell death induced by inhibition of transcription factor Stat5 was determined by photometric enzyme immunoassay (Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS, Roche Applied Science). Prostate cancer cells were plated on 6-well plates and infected the next morning with adenovirus carrying either DNStat5, WTStat5, or lacZ or with empty control virus. Cells were scraped and centrifuged at 200 × g, and cytoplasmic fractions containing fragmented DNA were transferred to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates that had been incubated with biotinylated monoclonal antihistone antibody. The amount of fragmented DNA of nucleosomes bound to anti-histone antibody was evaluated by peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-DNA antibody using ABTS (2,2′-azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate-6-diammonium salt]) as a substrate at 405 nm. Flow Cytometry—CWR22Rv and LnCap cells (1 × 106 cells/sample) were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, pelleted at 1,000 × g, and washed once in 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. After a second centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed by dropwise addition of 1.5 ml of cold 100% ethanol while slowly vortexing the cell suspension. After having been fixed for 1 h at 4 °C, cells were stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (Roche Applied Science) and treated with RNase A (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a Coulter EPICS XL cell analyzer (Beckman-Coulter). Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 Activity Assays—Activation of caspase-3 (Roche Applied Science) and caspase-9 (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) was determined by fluorometric enzyme assays. Prostate cancer cells were plated on 6-well plates and infected the next morning with adenovirus carrying either DNStat5, WTStat5, or lacZ or with empty control virus. Cells were scraped and centrifuged at 500 × g, and cytoplasmic fractions containing activated caspases were transferred to microtiter plates. Caspase-3 substrate (DEVD) or caspase-9 substrate (LEHD) labeled with the fluorescent molecule 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin were added to the samples. Free fluorescent 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin was generated proportionally to the amount of activated caspase in the cell lysate due to proteolytic cleavage of the substrate and determined fluorometrically at 505 nm. Stat5 Is Frequently Activated in Human Prostate Cancer—We have recently described a highly sensitive in situ detection method for activation of Stat5 in paraffin-embedded tissue, which is based on immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated Stat5 that is localized within the cell nucleus (10Ahonen T.J. Harkonen P.L. Rui H. Nevalainen M.T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Nevalainen M.T. Xie J. Bubendorf L. Wagner K.U. Rui H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1108-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This method, complemented with immunohistochemical detection of nuclear Stat5 protein, was applied to a material of 40 human prostate cancer specimens, and significant activation of Stat5 was detected in 65% (26 of 40) of primary human prostate cancer specimens of various Gleason scores. Representative samples illustrating Stat5 activation by either phosphotyrosine detection or nuclear anti-Stat5 detection within malignant human prostate epithelia are presented (Fig. 1A, panels a and b, respectively). In contrast, Stat5 phosphotyrosine staining was negative (Fig. 1A, panel c) and nuclear immunostaining for Stat5 was absent (data not shown) in adjacent normal secretory prostate epithelial cells. Lactating human breast epithelium is presented as a positive control for tyrosine-phosphorylated, activated human Stat5 (17Nevalainen M.T. Xie J. Bubendorf L. Wagner K.U. Rui H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1108-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and parallel sections of lactating human breast stained with subtypespecific mouse IgG were negative (Fig. 1A, panels d and e, respectively). Stat5 Is Activated in CWR22Rv and LnCap Cell Lines but Not in PC-3 Cells—We next examined Stat5a and Stat5b protein expression and activation in three human prostate cancer cell lines, including the androgen-independent CWR22Rv and PC-3 cells, and the androgen-sensitive LnCap cell line. For this analysis, immunoprecipitation of either Stat5a or Stat5b was followed by immunoblotting with the anti-phospho-TyrStat5 antibody or with antibodies to either Stat5a or Stat5b. Stat5b was the predominant Stat5 protein expressed in CWR22Rv and LnCap cells both during exponential growth (Fig. 1B, LD) and in confluent culture conditions (Fig. 1B, high density, HD). In both CWR22Rv and LnCap cells at low and at high cell density, Stat5b was phosphorylated on the critical Tyr-699 residue. In contrast, no activation of Stat5a or Stat5b was detected in PC-3 cells, consistent with low or undetectable levels of Stat5 protein in these cells (Fig. 1B). Blocking of Stat5 Activity in Human Prostate Cancer Lines Induces Cell Death—Based on the prevalent activation of Stat5 in human prostate cancer tissues, we hypothesized that Stat5 may act as a survival protein in human prostate cancer. Therefore, we tested whether blocking Stat5 function in human prostate cancer cells would induce cell death. To block activated endogenous Stat5 proteins in human prostate cancer, we generated an adenovirus for effective delivery of DNStat5 and a matching control virus carrying WTStat5. The molecular construction of the adenoviral vector carrying dominant-negative Stat5a (AdDNStat5) and the matching control, AdWTStat5, is described under “Materials and Methods.” Truncation of Stat5a after amino acid 713 removes the entire transcriptional activation domain and generates a Stat5a mutant that is almost identical to the corresponding Stat5b-truncated form. As expected, the Stat5a mutant effectively blocked the function of both WTStat5a and Stat5b (18Yamashita H. Iwase H. Toyama T. Fujii Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1638-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have further validated both the AdDNStat5 and the AdWTStat5 viral constructs in functional assays, including assays for gene induction, inducible tyrosine phosphorylation, and DNA binding (data not shown). To determine whether blocking endogenous Stat5 activity would induce death of human prostate cancer cells, we first examined the effect of increasing doses of AdDNStat5 on the viability of the androgen-independent CWR22Rv cell line. For the initial cell viability studies, we used an assay determining the metabolic activity of the cells. CWR22Rv cells were cultured to 70% confluence in 96-well plates and exposed for 90 min to AdDNStat5 or AdWTStat5 at doses up to 10 m.o.i., after which the virus was diluted 6-fold in culture medium as described. After 96 h of infection, cells were analyzed for cell viability. A marked and dose-dependent effect of the expression of DNStat5 on cell viability was observed with detectable suppression at m.o.i of 2.5 and suppression of cell viability by >90% at 10 m.o.i. (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cells infected with AdWTStat5 or AdLacZ did not show significant loss of viability (Fig. 1C). Viability of CWR22Rv cells infected with an empty control virus (AdCtrl) was not reduced (data not shown). The selective effect of AdDNStat5 in CWR22Rv cells was consistently observed in experiments that were repeated and reproduced more than five times and with four different independently titered batches of virus. Prostate Cancer Cell Death Induced by DNStat5 Represents Apoptosis—Microscopic assessment of the effect of AdDNStat5 on CWR22Rv cell viability confirmed extensive cell death following expression of DNStat5. CWR22Rv cells exposed to AdDNStat5 at 8 m.o.i. for 72 h displayed extensive cell death as evidenced by cell rounding, detachment, shrinkage, and blebbing (Fig. 1D, panel b), which are morphological changes consistent with apoptotic cell death. In contrast, there was no evidence of reduced cell viability in response to AdWTStat5 (Fig. 1D, panel a). Likewise, AdDNStat5 but not AdWTStat5 induced cell death also in the androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line, LnCap (Fig. 1D, panels c and d). Doseresponse analyses showed that 2–4-fold higher doses of virus were needed to induce cell death in LnCap cells compared with CWR22Rv cells (data not shown), an effect that correlated with less efficient adenoviral gene delivery of Stat5 proteins into LnCap cells. Specifically, dose-response analyses of viral protein delivery revealed that the same amount of virus induced lower levels of DNStat5 or WTStat5 expression in LnCap cells than in CWR22Rv cells shown by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1E). Fig. 1E also indicates that cellular levels of DNStat5 and WTStat5 delivered by the respective adenoviral vectors are comparable, supporting the notion that the selective cell death observed in response to AdDNStat5 is attributed to its specific dominant-negative characteristics and not caused by other nonspecific mechanisms. In contrast, there were no signs of cell death in PC-3 cells after 72 h exposure to AdDNStat5 at 32 m.o.i. as judged from cell morphology (data not shown). To further verify that DNStat5-induced killing of prostate cancer cells was due to apoptotic cell death, prostate cancer cells were analyzed for DNStat5-induced fragmentation of DNA. CWR22Rv cells were exposed to AdDNStat5 and a set of controls at 8 m.o.i. for 48 h. A selective effect of DNStat5 on induction of DNA fragmentation was observed as analyzed by an ELISA of nucleosomal DNA fragments (Fig. 2A, panel a). On average, a 7-fold increase in nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected in cells exposed to AdDNStat5 over that detected in WTStat5 expressing cells (6 repeats, each with 3 replicates/treatment group). Furthermore, DNStat5-induced death of LnCap cells was also associated with DNA fragmentation as evidenced by a consistent and >6-fold increase in DNA fragmentation over levels in AdWTStat5-treated cells on day 3 at 32 m.o.i. (Fig. 2A, panel b) (6 repeats, each with 3 replicates/treatment group). Therefore, we conclude that suppression of Stat5 induces apoptotic cell death in both CWR22Rv and LnCap cells as revealed by fragmentation of DNA. In contrast, exposure of PC-3 cells, which do not express active Stat5, to AdDNStat5 did not increase fragmentation of DNA when compared with cells expressing WTStat5 or with cells infected with empty control virus, AdLacZ, or mock-infected cells (Fig. 2A, panel c). Apoptotic cell death of prostate cancer cells expressing DNStat5 was also verified by cell cycle analysis. In both CWR22Rv and LnCap cells expressing DNStat5 but not in cells expressing AdWTStat5, extensive DNA fragmentation was detected in the form of a large fraction of hypodiploid cell fragments (Fig. 2B). In CWR22Rv cells, this proportion was estimated to be ∼8% of total cellular DNA at day 3 of AdDNStat5 infection using 8 m.o.i., which was 8-fold higher than that observed in parallel AdWTStat5-treated cells (0.9%). In LnCap cells, the fraction of cell fragments with hypodiploid DNA content increased 6-fold from 1.3% in AdWTStat5-treated cells to ∼8% in AdDNStat5-treated cells. Mock-infected cells and cells infected with empty control virus or AdlacZ were used as controls, and the fraction of hypodiploid cells consistently remained below 1.3% (data not shown). DNStat5-induced Apoptosis of CWR22Rv and LnCap Cells Involves Caspase-3 Activation—Proteolytic enzymes of the caspase family are critical mediators of programmed cell death. A central role has been ascribed to caspase-3 as a key executor of a major category of apoptotic cell death (19Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). To determine whether apoptosis in prostate cancer cells induced by expression of DNStat5 is mediated by activation of caspase-3, we analyzed caspase-3 activation by a specific caspase-3 enzymatic assay. Exposure of CWR22Rv or LnCap cells to AdDNStat5 for 36 or 48 h, respectively, activated caspase-3 in both cell lines (Fig. 2C). Specifically, in CWR22Rv cells, activation of caspase-3 was increased 8-fold in cells expressing DNStat5 compared with AdWTStat5-infected cells. In LnCap cells, the corresponding increase was ∼2-fold (3 repeats each with 3 replicates/treatment group). Therefore, we conclude that DNStat5-induced apoptosis in both CWR22Rv and LnCap human prostate cancer cells involved the activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 mediated apoptosis may be induced through upstream activation of caspase-9 in a cytochrome c-dependent manner or through caspase-9-independent mechanisms (20Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Because suppression of Stat5 activation in CWR22Rv and LnCap cells induced activation of caspase-3, we wanted to determine whether DNStat5-induced activation of caspase-3 involved the activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 activity was monitored in response to DNStat5 in both CWR22Rv and LnCap cells for up to 72 h. A 6-fold induction of caspase-9 was detected at 36 h in CWR22Rv cells expressing DNStat5 (Fig. 2D). In LnCap cells, the same trend was observed but the effect was less striking (data not shown). We conclude that DNStat5-induced cell death in CWR22Rv cells is mediated by caspase-3 through a caspase-9-dependent mechanism. Caspase-9 activation further indicates a cytochrome c/Apaf-1-dependent apoptotic process (20Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Ongoing work aims to define the exact sequence of molecular events that are involved in DNStat5-induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis. The prevalent detection of activated Stat5 in primary human prostate cancer specimens indicates that Stat5 is a candidate therapeutic target in a high proportion of prostate cancers. A recent study by Gao and colleagues (21Ni Z. Lou W. Lee S.O. Dhir R. DeMiguel F. Grandis J.R. Gao A.C. J. Urol. 2002; 167: 1859-1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that in human prostate tissue homogenates there was only a low level of Stat5 binding to an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the Stat5-response element of the rat β-casein promoter in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (21Ni Z. Lou W. Lee S.O. Dhir R. DeMiguel F. Grandis J.R. Gao A.C. J. Urol. 2002; 167: 1859-1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that prostate cancer-specific or stromal factors interfere with binding of Stat5 to this promoter when whole tissues are homogenized. In this regard, using our highly sensitive in situ technique, which detects Stat5 activation at a single cell level, we have recently demonstrated that Stat5 is activated in normal human and mouse mammary epithelial cells outside of pregnancy, an activity that is difficult to detect by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using tissue homogenates of whole mammary glands (17Nevalainen M.T. Xie J. Bubendorf L. Wagner K.U. Rui H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1108-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This work suggests that blocking activation of Stat5 in human prostate is a potential new therapeutic approach. Delivery of suicide genes into cancer cells is hampered by lack of effective delivery systems, but gene therapeutic delivery systems are constantly improving and involve both viral and non-viral strategies (22Mah C. Byrne B.J. Flotte T.R. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2002; 41: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Niidome T. Huang L. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Future prostate cancer gene therapy based on delivery of DNStat5 may therefore be feasible. On the other hand, small molecule inhibitors of the Stat5 tyrosine kinase(s) responsible for Stat5 activation in prostate cancer could represent an alternative and more effective approach to inhibit Stat5 in human prostate cancer with even more attractive pharmacological characteristics. Ongoing work in our laboratory seeks to identify the Stat5 tyrosine kinase(s) responsible for activating Stat5 in prostate cancer. In this respect, the Jak2 tyrosine kinase is a central candidate since this enzyme is responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 by a series of cytokine receptors, including receptors for prolactin (Prl). Prl receptor associated signaling pathways are of particular interest, because Prl is produced locally in prostate epithelium indicating an autocrine loop of Prl action in prostate (1Nevalainen M.T. Valve E.M. Ingleton P.M. Nurmi M. Martikainen P.M. Harkonen P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Nevalainen M.T. Valve E.M. Ahonen T. Yagi A. Paranko J. Harkonen P.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to Jak2, other tyrosine kinases such as Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, or Tyk2 as well as members of the Src tyrosine kinase family or receptor tyrosine kinases are also possible Stat5 kinases in prostate cancer (24Grimley P.M. Dong F. Rui H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We show in this work using in situ detection of phosphorylated and nuclear Stat5 that Stat5 was activated in a majority of prostate cancer specimens examined. This suggests that inhibition of Stat5 as a therapeutic approach could have a broad usefulness in the treatment of prostate cancer. The observation that both androgen-refractory CWR22Rv and androgen-sensitive LnCap cells responded to suppression of Stat5 with cell death implies that apoptosis induced by blocking the activation of Stat5 is independent of responsiveness to androgens. Furthermore, the correlation between endogenous Stat5 activation in prostate cancer cell lines and their sensitivity to DNStat5 suggests that immunohistochemical detection of activated Stat5 in prostate cancer may predict responsiveness to this therapeutic strategy.

We report here that ankyrin-R is capable of interacting directly with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Rh and RhAG polypeptides. We first show that the primary defect of ankyrin-R in normoblastosis (nb/nb) spherocytosis mutant mice is associated with a sharp reduction of RhAG and Rh polypeptides. Secondly, our flow cytometric analysis of the Triton X-100 extractability of recombinant fusion proteins expressed in erythroleukemic cell lines suggests that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of Rh and RhAG are sufficient to mediate interaction with the erythroid membrane skeleton. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we demonstrate a direct interaction between the cytoplasmic tails of Rh and RhAG and the second repeat domain (D2) of ankyrin-R. This finding is supported by the demonstration that the substitution of Asp-399 in the cytoplasmic tail of RhAG, a mutation associated with the deficiency of the Rh complex in one Rhnull patient, totally impaired interaction with domain D2 of ankyrin-R. These results identify the Rh/RhAG-ankyrin complex as a new interaction site between the red cell membrane and the spectrin-based skeleton, the disruption of which might result in the stomato-spherocytosis typical of Rhnull red cells.

The red cell skeleton is organized in a two-dimensional network predominantly composed of spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1, along with adaptor proteins like ankyrin, protein 4.2, p55, protein 4.9, adducin, tropomyosin, myosin, and tropomodulin (2Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P. Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 1701-1818Google Scholar). The integrity of this skeleton and its linkage with integral transmembrane proteins is crucial for the maintenance of the mechanical properties of the RBC. This is evidenced by the morphological abnormalities of the RBC that result in hemolytic anemia of varying severity (hereditary elliptocytosis (HE), pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), spherocytosis (HS), and ovalo-stomatocytosis (SAO). These abnormalities are associated with mutations of different skeletal and integral membrane proteins that alter “horizontal” or “vertical” protein/protein interactions (3Delaunay J. Acta Haematol. 2002; 108: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The band 3-ankyrin protein 4.2 and the glycophorin C (GPC) protein 4.1-p55 complexes represent well characterized major attachment sites between the membrane bilayer and the red cell skeleton (4Bhattacharyya R. Das A.K. Moitra P.K. Pal B. Mandal I. Basu J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Parra M. Conboy J. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24540-24546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, there is increasing evidence, as discussed below, that another important interaction site involves the membrane protein complex that carry the Rh antigens. The Rh blood group antigens are defined by a complex association of membrane polypeptides that includes the non-glycosylated Rh proteins (carriers of the RhD and RhCcEe blood group antigens) and RhAG, the Rh-associated glycoprotein, which is strictly required for cell surface expression of Rh (6Cherif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Gane P. Mattei M.G. Bailly P. Gibbs B. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7Mouro-Chanteloup I. D'Ambrosio A.M. Gane P. Le Van Kim C. Raynal V. Dhermy D. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 2002; 100: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rh and RhAG are major components of the erythrocyte membrane (about 200,000 copies per cell) and exhibit structural homology with the NH4+ transporters of the Mep/Amt super-family (8Marini A.M. Urrestarazu A. Beauwens R. Andre B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 460-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Most importantly, recent independent studies have shown that RhAG and its kidney homologue RhCG can act as bidirectional ammonium transporters, at least when expressed in heterologous systems (9Marini A.M. Matassi G. Raynal V. Andre B. Cartron J.P. Cherif-Zahar B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 10Westhoff C.M. Ferreri-Jacobia M. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12499-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In red cells, a tetramer composed of two Rh and two RhAG subunits is thought to constitute the core of the Rh complex to which accessory chains (CD47, LW, and GPB) are associated by non-covalent linkages (11Cartron J.P. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 1999; 12: 655-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Avent N.D. Reid M.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 375-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The morphological abnormalities of Rhnull erythrocytes (stomato-spherocytosis), associated with the primary defects of Rh or RhAG, suggest a biologically important association of the Rh complex to the red cell skeleton (11Cartron J.P. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 1999; 12: 655-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Huang C.H. Cheng G. Liu Z. Chen Y. Reid M.E. Halverson G. Okubo Y. Am. J. Hematol. 1999; 62: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Supporting such a role, several studies indicate that Rh, RhAG, and CD47 are, in great part, resistant to membrane solubilization by non-ionic detergent and therefore remain predominantly associated with the detergent-insoluble material (DIM) of erythroid precursor cells cultured and differentiated in vitro, mature red cells, and erythroleukemic cell lines (14Gahmberg C.G. Karhi K.K. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 334-337PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ridgwell K. Tanner M.J. Anstee D.J. FEBS Lett. 1984; 174: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Gane P. Le Van Kim C. Bony V. El Nemer W. Mouro I. Nicolas V. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 1-10Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Evidence that these results currently account for an association of the Rh complex with the erythroid membrane skeleton rather than with lipid rafts (defined as detergent insoluble lipid rich membrane microdomains) (17Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar), has been recently provided by fluorescence imaged microdeformation (FIMD) analysis of intact RBCs (18Discher D.E. Mohandas N. Evans E.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In these studies, the behavior of Rh and CD47 proteins were intermediate between that of actin and band 3, whereas that of RhAG was similar to that of GPC and actin (19Gimm A. Mouro I. Lambin P. Mohandas N. Cartron J.P. Vox Sang. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 14Google Scholar, 20Dahl K.N. Westhoff C.M. Discher D.E. Blood. 2003; 101: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 2N. Mohandas and J. P. Cartron, unpublished results. These results imply that the Rh complex, presumably via Rh and/or RhAG and/or CD47, is firmly linked to the spectrinactin based erythroid membrane skeleton. However, which protein of the Rh complex and which skeletal protein are involved in this vertical interaction remain unknown. Recently, an association between CD47 and protein 4.2 was indicated by the observation that RBCs with complete protein 4.2 deficiency (4.2(–)HS) exhibit a 80–90% reduction of CD47 (21Bruce L.J. Ghosh S. King M.J. Layton D.M. Mawby W.J. Stewart G.W. Oldenborg P.A. Delaunay J. Tanner M.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 1878-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Mouro-Chanteloup I. Delaunay J. Gane P. Nicolas V. Johansen M. Brown E.J. Peters L.L. Van Kim C.L. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, CD47 linkage to the red cell skeleton was found to be independent of Rh and RhAG (20Dahl K.N. Westhoff C.M. Discher D.E. Blood. 2003; 101: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and neither the expression level nor the Triton X-100 extraction of Rh and RhAG from the cell membrane were altered by the absence of protein 4.2 in 4.2(–)HS RBCs (22Mouro-Chanteloup I. Delaunay J. Gane P. Nicolas V. Johansen M. Brown E.J. Peters L.L. Van Kim C.L. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that protein 4.2 is not involved in linking the core of the Rh complex to the membrane skeleton. Because protein 4.2 appears to interact with CD47 and has been experimentally shown to bind ankyrin (4Bhattacharyya R. Das A.K. Moitra P.K. Pal B. Mandal I. Basu J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that Rh and RhAG, which are associated with CD47 within the Rh complex, might interact with the spectrin-based skeleton through an association with ankyrin. Ankyrins are adaptor proteins that constitute a family of proteins expressed in many cell types and possess binding sites for both integral and cytoskeletal membrane proteins. In vertebrates, three genes, Ank1, Ank2 and Ank3, control the tissue-specific expression of the ankyrin-R, ankyrin-B, and ankyrin-G proteins, respectively (23Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), and only ankyrin-R is expressed in erythroid cells. In this paper, we describe a direct and specific association between the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of Rh and RhAG and the repeat domain D2 of the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring mutation of RhAG, associated with the stomato-spherocytosis phenotype of one Rhnull patient, has a deleterious effect on RhAG-ankyrin-R association. Therefore, we propose that Rh, RhAG, and ankyrin-R constitute a new major protein complex involved in the linkage of the red cell membrane lipid bilayer to the underlying skeleton. Materials—Monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-Lub (clone LM342) was from Dr. R. H. Fraser (Regional Donor Center, Glasgow, United Kingdom). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2, phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments, and normal donkey serum were provided by Beckman Coulter (Villepinte, France) and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Primers used in polymerase chain reaction and mutagenesis experiments were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and the Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase were provided by Stratagene. The pGEX-3X-5 vector, the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and [35S]methionine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The TnT T7/SP6 coupled reticulocyte lysate system were from Promega (Madison, WI). The pG-BKT7 and pGADT7 vectors from the Matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid system III were provided by Clontech. Analysis of Mouse RBC Membrane Proteins—Wild type (WBB6F1 and BALB/c) and mutant mice were from The Jackson Laboratory. RBCs were collected from the intraorbital sinus of mice exhibiting several phenotypes. Homozygous normoblastosis (nb/nb) mice characterized by a complete deficiency in full-length 210-kDa ankyrin-R associated with spontaneous defect in the Ank1 gene were described previously (24White R.A. Birkenmeier C.S. Lux S.E. Barker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3117-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). β-adducin–/– gene-targeted mice (25Gilligan D.M. Lozovatsky L. Gwynn B. Brugnara C. Mohandas N. Peters L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. L. L. Peters (The Jackson Laboratory). Preparation of RBC membranes, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting of membrane proteins were done as described previously (22Mouro-Chanteloup I. Delaunay J. Gane P. Nicolas V. Johansen M. Brown E.J. Peters L.L. Van Kim C.L. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For flow cytometric measurement, 2 μl of packed red cells were fixed at room temperature in 1 ml of 1% formol/0.025% glutaraldehyde for 15 min and then in 1 ml of 3% formol overnight. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH7.4.) Fixed red cells were permeabilized in 1 ml of 0.2% SDS/PBS for 1 min at room temperature. After washing, 50 μl of permeabilized red cells diluted in PBS (1:500) with 0.2% bovine serum albumin were incubated with a donkey serum for 20 min at room temperature to eliminate unspecific signals. Following incubations with the MPC8 anti-Rh (26Hermand P. Mouro I. Huet M. Bloy C. Suyama K. Goldstein J. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. Blood. 1993; 82: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the mCTRhAG anti-murine RhAG (7Mouro-Chanteloup I. D'Ambrosio A.M. Gane P. Le Van Kim C. Raynal V. Dhermy D. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 2002; 100: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) polyclonal antibodies, cells were incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody and analyzed using a FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Stainings with the rat anti-murine CD47 (27Lindberg F.P. Bullard D.C. Caver T.E. Gresham H.D. Beaudet A.L. Brown E.J. Science. 1996; 274: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) or the human anti-Dia (HIRO-71) and anti-Dib (HIRO-58) (generous gifts from Dr. Uchikawa, Red Cross of Japan), mAbs were carried out similarly except that the cells were not fixed or permeabilized and goat anti-rat or anti-human phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies were used. As expected from comparative analysis of mouse band 3 cDNA sequence (28Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1985; 316: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and the amino acid polymorphism associated with the Dia/Dib blood group polymorphism in man (P854L) (29Bruce L.J. Anstee D.J. Spring F.A. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16155-16158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse band 3 could be detected by the anti-Dib but not the anti-Dia mAb. 3V. Nicolas, C. Le Van Kim, P. Gane, C. Birkenmeier, J. P. Cartron, Y. Colin, and I. Mouro-Chanteloup, unpublished results. To check the permeabilization efficiency, actin staining was performed on all cells at room temperature with 10 μl of phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma). Lu Fusion Protein Constructs, Transfection, and Flow Cytometric Analysis—A Lu-tailless expression vector was constructed by in vitro mutagenesis of the pcDNA3-Lub plasmid described previously (30El Nemer W. Rahuel C. Colin Y. Gane P. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Blood. 1997; 89: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An EcoRI subcloning site and a following TAA stop codon were introduced at position 1720 (+1 taken as the first nucleotide of the initiator ATG codon). Sequences for the 29, 26, 47, and 28 amino acid-long intracytoplasmic C-terminal tails of Rh, RhAG, GPC, and the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), respectively, were obtained by PCR. Lu-Rh, Lu-RhAG, Lu-GPC, Lu-DARC fusion proteins were constructed by introducing the PCR products at the EcoRI site of the Lu-tailless construct. Human erythroleukemia K562 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were stably transfected by the Lu fusion plasmids and grown in RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 0.6 g/liter neomycin (G418). Lu-positive cells were detected by flow cytometry using the anti-Lub mAb. The linkage between each fusion protein and the DIM was assessed by comparing the anti-Lub antibody binding capacity of intact and Triton X-100 treated cells, as described previously (16Gane P. Le Van Kim C. Bony V. El Nemer W. Mouro I. Nicolas V. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 1-10Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Studies—The D1, D2, D3, and D4 subdomains of the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R were amplified by PCR using previously described plasmids as templates (31Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The four domains were inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGADT7 in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain. cDNA fragments encoding the C-terminal domains of Rh and RhAG were amplified by PCR and inserted into pGBKT7 to generate fusion genes with the DNA binding domain of GAL4. Mutant forms of RhAG were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The pGBKT7 and pGADT7 constructs were co-transformed into the AH109 yeast strain using the Li acetate method (32Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The AH109 cotransformants were grown on plates lacking leucine and tryptophane. After 3 days of growth at 30 °C, the colonies were streaked onto plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophane. Protein interactions were analyzed 3 days following plating and confirmed by β-galactosidase assays as recommended by the manufacturer (Matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid System III, Clontech). GST Pull-down Assays—The PCR amplified cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal end of RhAG was fused in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase protein in the pGEX-5X-3 plasmid to generate the pGEX-RhAG clone. Mutant form of RhAG was obtained by in vitro mutagenesis. The GST fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 were purified by elution from glutathione-Sepharose beads. The PCR-amplified D2 subdomain of ankyrin-R was subcloned into the BglII-SpeI restriction sites of the in vitro expression vector pT7TS and in vitro translated using the TnT T7/SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine. For the GST pull-down assay, 7.5 μg of GST fusion proteins were bound to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked by incubation for 20 min at 4 °C with 2% bovine serum albumin. After two washes with binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), equal amounts of in vitro translated D2-ankyrin-R were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the beads in 250 μl of binding buffer. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer and once with binding buffer lacking Tween 20. Proteins were then eluted with 35 μl of glutathione buffer, and binding reactions were analyzed by autoradiography of 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Ankyrin-R-deficient Mouse RBCs Are Rh- and RhAG-deficient—Cell surface expression of the Rh complex on RBCs from ankyrin-R-deficient (nb/nb) and β-adducin-deficient (adducin –/–) mice was compared with wild type by flow cytometric analysis of Rh, RhAG, and CD47, as described previously (22Mouro-Chanteloup I. Delaunay J. Gane P. Nicolas V. Johansen M. Brown E.J. Peters L.L. Van Kim C.L. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that Rh and RhAG were reduced by 53 and 97%, respectively, in RBCs from nb/nb mice (n = 3) compared with wild type and adducin –/–, whereas CD47 was normally expressed in all samples (Fig. 1). To validate these results, two controls were performed. i) Cell surface expression of murine band 3 was found to be reduced by 50% in nb/nb mice, which is in agreement with previous chromatographic analysis of nb/nb RBC membrane proteins (33Yi S.J. Liu S.C. Derick L.H. Murray J. Barker J.E. Cho M.R. Palek J. Golan D.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9596-9604Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ii) The fluorescence given by the binding of phalloidin to actin was analyzed on intact and permeabilized/fixed RBCs; as expected, no signal was obtained in non-treated RBCs (not shown), whereas similar mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were obtained with all permeabilized RBCs (Fig. 1), indicating that the reduced reactivity in nb/nb RBCs of antibodies against intracellular epitopes of Rh and RhAG could not result from a potentially reduced permeabilization efficiency of these cells associated with their membrane abnormalities. Immunoblotting experiments gave results that support the flow cytometric analysis with a deficiency of Rh and RhAG in nb/nb RBC membrane protein preparations (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that the reduction of Rh was much more drastic than would be expected from the 50–60% reduction deduced from flow cytometric analysis and that the amount of CD47 appeared reduced in nb/nb red cell membrane sample despite a normal cell surface expression (Fig. 1). This illustrates, as was pointed out previously in the course of band 3–/– mouse RBC analysis (34Southgate C.D. Chishti A.H. Mitchell B. Yi S.J. Palek J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the difficulty of quantitatively comparing normal and mutant membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting experiments because of the excessive hemolysis, hemoglobin-membrane association, and partial protein degradation in HS mouse samples. However, comparison of the ratio between CD47 and Rh or RhAG in wild type and nb/nb samples (Fig. 2) clearly confirmed the deficiency of Rh and RhAG in nb/nb mouse RBCs. Fusion Proteins Containing the C-terminal Cytoplasmic Domains of Rh and RhAG Can Interact with DIM of Transfected K562 Erythroleukemic Cells—We have previously developed a flow cytometry-based method to analyze the association of transmembrane proteins with the erythroid skeleton as defined by the DIM obtained after Triton X-100 extraction of the lipid bilayer from K562 erythroleukemic cells. Using this approach, we have estimated that 54 and 79% of Rh and RhAG molecules were DIM-associated in K562 cells, respectively (16Gane P. Le Van Kim C. Bony V. El Nemer W. Mouro I. Nicolas V. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 1-10Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To evaluate the specific role of the C-terminal tails of the 12 transmembrane domain (TM) Rh and RhAG proteins in the association with the DIM of K562 cells, we have constructed fusion proteins in which the 29 and 26 C-terminal residues of Rh and RhAG, respectively, were directly fused to the single extracellular and transmembrane domains of the Lu adhesion molecule (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, comparison of the anti-Lu antibody binding capacity of intact and Triton X-100 treated cells revealed that 59 and 65% of Lu-Rh and Lu-RhAG, respectively, were linked to the DIM of transfected K562 cells. As positive controls, 50% of the intact Lu glycoprotein and 68% of the Lu-GPC fusion protein in which the cytoplasmic tail of Lu has been replaced by that of GPC remained attached to the DIM. As negative controls, the truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of Lu (Lu-tailless protein) or its replacement by the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of DARC (Lu-DARC fusion protein), a seven TM domain chemokine receptor not associated with DIM (16Gane P. Le Van Kim C. Bony V. El Nemer W. Mouro I. Nicolas V. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 1-10Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), resulted in a significant decrease of DIM association of the recombinant proteins (Lu-tailless, 31%; Lu-DARC, 27%). The C-terminal Cytoplasmic Domains of Rh and RhAG Bind to the D2 Repeat Domain of the Membrane Binding Domain of Ankyrin-R—Considering the results presented above, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay to test the hypothesis that the C-cytoplasmic tails of Rh and RhAG might interact with ankyrin-R and particularly with one or several of the four N-terminal ankyrin repeat domains shown previously to interact with various transmembrane proteins. The C-terminal domains of Rh and RhAG were fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the yeast two-hybrid pGBKT7 vector, and the four repeat domains of ankyrin-R (D1, D2, D3, and D4) were individually fused in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain of the pGBKT7 vector. The recombinant vectors were cotransformed in yeast, and their ability to grow in high stringency selective media lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophane was analyzed (Fig. 4, A and B). These experiments, confirmed by β-galactosidase activity analysis (not shown), indicated that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of Rh and RhAG specifically interact with the D2 repeat domain of ankyrin-R. No association between the cytoplasmic tails of Rh and RhAG and the remaining D1, D3, and D4 repeat domains of ankyrin could be detected (Fig. 4) even when yeasts were grown in less stringent medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophane but containing adenine (data not shown). A survey of the literature revealed that one missense mutation (H276R) in the D2 domain is associated with the HS phenotype of one Brazilian patient (35Leite R.C. Basseres D.S. Ferreira J.S. Alberto F.L. Costa F.F. Saad S.T. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, as analyzed by two-hybrid assay, this mutation has no effect on Rh/RhAG-AnkR interaction (not shown). The Rh null -associated Substitution of Asp-399 Alters Interaction of RhAG to Ankyrin-R and to DIM of K562 cells—Mutation of Asp-399 has been identified previously in the cytoplasmic tail of RhAG from one Rhnull patient (11Cartron J.P. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 1999; 12: 655-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have now generated mutated forms of RhAG in which Asp-399 or the closely located Asp-393 and Asp-398 residues have been replaced by alanine and tested their capacity to bind to the D2 domain of ankyrin using the two-hybrid system described above. Neither the D393A nor the D398A substitutions altered the growth of cotransformed yeast in selective medium (Fig. 5A) or its β-galactosidase activity (not shown). In contrast, substitution of Asp-399 abolished both the capacity of cotransformed yeast to grow on restrictive media and its β-galactosidase activity, indicating that Asp-399 is critical for the binding of the C-terminal tail of RhAG to ankyrin-R. To confirm the role of Asp-399 in the ankyrin-R binding capacity of RhAG, we performed a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 5B). Wild type or a D399A mutated form of the C-terminal domain of RhAG were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and tested for their ability to interact in vitro with the D2 ankyrin repeat domain translated in vitro. Equivalent amounts of the GST-RhAG and GST-RhAG/D399A proteins, as assessed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 5B, top), were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with the [35S] radiolabeled Ank-D2 repeat domain. SDS-PAGE analysis of Ank-D2 bound and eluted from the different matrix-bound GST fusion proteins indicated that the D399A substitution dramatically reduced the binding of GST-RhAG fusion protein to Ank-D2 (Fig. 5B, bottom). To test the importance of Asp-399 in a cellular model, the D399A mutation was introduced in the Lu-RhAG fusion protein, and K562 cell DIM association was analyzed as described above. The percentage of chimeric Lu-RhAG/D399A proteins associated with the DIM of K562 cells was significantly decreased compared with wild type Lu-RhAG (36 ± 7% versus 65%; not shown). A powerful and simple approach to identify potential interactions between skeletal and integral membrane proteins is to compare the expression of cell surface markers in abnormal RBCs with well defined deficiency of skeletal proteins to that of normal RBCs. Because Rh and RhAG deficiency is associated with stomato-spherocytosis of Rhnull red cells, we and others have analyzed Rh complex expression in some HS red cells with primary defects in different skeletal or transmembrane proteins. Using this approach, a positive correlation between the expression levels of CD47 and protein 4.2 has been recently reported from the analysis of 4.2(–)HS red cells (21Bruce L.J. Ghosh S. King M.J.

Johansen M. Brown E.J. Peters L.L. Van Kim C.L. Cartron J.P. Colin Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, as discussed in our introduction, the lack of protein 4.2 has no deleterious effect on the expression level and skeleton linkage of Rh and RhAG. These observations indicate that defective interaction(s) between CD47 and protein 4.2 could not be responsible for cell shape abnormalities of Rhnull red cells and that other proteins must be involved in the interaction of the Rh complex to the skeleton. Band 3, the red cell anion exchanger, has recently been proposed to represent such a protein. Indeed, from the observation that expression of the Rh complex is sharply decreased in human and mouse HS RBCs with a primary defect in band 3, it has been postulated that Rh and RhAG, as part of a potential band 3-based macrocomplex, might be indirectly linked to the red cell skeleton through direct lateral association with band 3 (36Bruce L.J. Beckmann R. Ribeiro M.L. Peters L.L. Chasis J.A. Delaunay J. Mohandas N. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, Rh and RhAG are associated with the skeleton of K562 cells and early erythroid precursors (16Gane P. Le Van Kim C. Bony V. El Nemer W. Mouro I. Nicolas V. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 1-10Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that lack band 3 to the same extent as with the skeleton of mature red cells that possess band 3 (19Gimm A. Mouro I. Lambin P. Mohandas N. Cartron J.P. Vox Sang. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 14Google Scholar, 20Dahl K.N. Westhoff C.M. Discher D.E. Blood. 2003; 101: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the core of the Rh complex might interact with the erythroid skeleton regardless of the presence or absence of band 3 and, therefore, do not support a model in which a direct interaction between band 3 and Rh/RhAG could modulate the association of the Rh complex to the skeleton. In this paper, we have analyzed expression of the Rh complex in HS red cells with a primary defect of ankyrin-R or β-adducin. This analysis, by showing a sharp reduction of Rh and RhAG in HS red cells from ankyrin-deficient normoblastosis mice (nb/nb), indicates ankyrin-R as a potential binding partner of the Rh complex. It is noteworthy that the cytoplasmic tails of Rh and RhAG are particularly well conserved across species as compared with the other domains of these 12 TM proteins (37Huang C.H. Liu Z. Apoil P.A. Blancher A. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and are capable of mediating the attachment of Lu-fusion transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton of K562 cells to the same extent as the whole Rh and RhAG proteins (our present results and Ref. 16Gane P. Le Van Kim C. Bony V. El Nemer W. Mouro I. Nicolas V. Colin Y. Cartron J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 1-10Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore assume that interaction between these domains and ankyrin-R plays a major role in the attachment of Rh and RhAG to the red cell skeleton. Supporting this hypothesis, the major finding of this study is the demonstration of a direct interaction in vitro between the cytoplasmic tails of human Rh and RhAG proteins and the D2 repeat subdomain of the membrane binding domain of ankyrin-R. The D2 domain of ankyrin-R was previously shown to mediate attachment of the spectrin-based membrane skeleton to a diverse set of membrane-spanning proteins like CD44 (38Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and band 3 (39Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A previous comparison between binding sites on ankyrin for neurofascin and the anion exchanger (31Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both proteins can interact simultaneously with ankyrin. Ankyrin can also form homocomplexes between two band 3 dimers via two distinct but cooperative binding sites (D2 and D3-D4) (39Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Consistent with this property of ankyrin to form homo-and heterocomplexes between membrane proteins, we propose a model for band 3-ankyrin-Rh/RhAG interactions in which ankyrin-R can bind directly and simultaneously to band 3 and Rh and/or RhAG via its D3-D4 and/or its D2 repeat domains respectively (Fig. 6). In agreement with this model, Rh and RhAG expression could be reduced not only in HS red cells with a primary defect of ankyrin, as in nb/nb mice (our present results), but also in HS red cells with a defect of ankyrin secondary to a primary defect in other membrane component, like band 3 (36Bruce L.J. Beckmann R. Ribeiro M.L. Peters L.L. Chasis J.A. Delaunay J. Mohandas N. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Hence, we assume that the reduced expression of Rh and RhAG in mouse and human band 3 null HS red cells might result from the secondary 60% reduction of ankyrin-R that is observed in these cells (34Southgate C.D. Chishti A.H. Mitchell B. Yi S.J. Palek J. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 40Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. Liu S.C. Hanspal M. John K.M. Gonzalez J.M.

Conversely, we postulate that the enhancing effect of band 3 on Rh/RhAG cell surface expression (42Beckmann R. Smythe J.S. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2496-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) could result from an increased membrane recruitment of ankyrin-R by band 3 in cotransfected cells, similarly to the previously demonstrated recruitment of ankyrin-G by neurofascin (43Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). According to a model in which ankyrin-R plays a pivotal role for expression of both band 3 and the Rh complex, flow cytometric and Western blot analysis indicate that band 3 expression is not altered in Rhnull cells and that these cells contain a normal amount of ankyrin.3 Interestingly, the Asp-399 residue of the cytoplasmic tail of RhAG was previously reported to be mutated in one Rhnull patient (11Cartron J.P. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 1999; 12: 655-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that the binding of band 3 to the D2 domain of ankyrin-R might be mediated by electrostatic contacts (39Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assumed that RhAG binding to the D2 repeat domain might be similarly mediated by electrostatic contacts involving conserved charged amino acids present on the C-terminal domain of RhAG. Among these charged residues, three aspartates at positions 393, 398, and 399 were mutated, but, most interestingly, only the Rhnull associated substitution of Asp-399 was able to abolish the association of RhAG to the D2 domain of ankyrin-R, and this mutation also abolishes the interaction with the DIM of K562 cells. Currently, hereditary spherocytosis is most often associated with mutations that directly affect the level of ankyrin-R expression or defects of skeletal proteins (such as protein 4.2) or membrane proteins (such as band 3) that bind to ankyrin-R (2Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P. Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 1701-1818Google Scholar). Similarly, our present results strongly suggest that disruption of the newly identified Rh/RhAG-ankyrin complex by the Asp-399 mutation of RhAG causes the lack of the Rh complex and the associated stomato-spherocytosis, at least in one Rhnull patient. In conclusion, this study provides the first description of an Rh/RhAG-ankyrin R membrane complex and its potential involvement in the morphological properties of the RBCs. Because Rh proteins and ankyrin-R have isoforms or homologues in nonerythroid cells, it is assumed that the Rh/RhAG-ankyrin interaction described in RBCs may also exist in other cell types. Further studies will be necessary to characterize these interactions in nonerythroid cells and determine whether and how they could modulate the emerging transporter function of different members of the Rh protein family.

It was originally identified in 1996 in a two-hybrid screen as protein interacting with and suppressing the toxicity of Aspergillus mitotic kinase never-in-mitosis A (NIMA) (1Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). hPin1 selectively catalyzes peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerization of phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro of proteins after they have been targeted by Ser/Thr-Pro-directed kinases (2Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 3Zhou X.Z.

Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of phosphorylated moieties provides a mechanism for switching a protein between different conformations, thereby influencing protein activity (4Zheng H. You H. Zhou X.Z.

Liou Y.C. Lu K.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). hPin1 substrates are proteins involved in regulation of cell cycle, transcription, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer pathogenesis. Phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl isomerization is proven, e.g. for regulation of phosphatase Cdc25 function, where hPin1 binds to p-Thr48-Pro and p-Thr67-Pro motifs in Cdc25C. These motifs are crucial for Cdc25C to activate Cdc2 and to trigger the G2/M transition. Conformational changes on Cdc25C induced by hPin1 were detected as sensitivity to proteases or by MPM-2 (phosphospecific mitosis marker antibody) recognition (6Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.J.

Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hPin1 may integrate signals mediated by different kinases, as it was shown for the kinase substrate p53. Phosphorylation of p53 at all three sites (Thr33-Pro, Thr81-Pro, and Ser315-Pro) is required for its efficient binding to hPin1 followed by dissociation from p53-directed E3 ligase, thereby stabilizing the p53 protein and activating its tumor-suppressor function (4Zheng H.

Functionally, hPin1 has been shown to regulate several phases of the cell cycle, including G1/S and G2/M transitions as well as the DNA replication checkpoint (1Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 8Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 9Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The protein is essential for growth of HeLa cells and arrests them in mitosis when depleted (1Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 10Rippmann J.F. Hobbie S. Daiber C. Guilliard B. Bauer M. Birk J. Nar H. Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 409-416PubMed Google Scholar). hPin1 overexpression activates the cyclin D1 promoter by regulation of c-Jun following JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) phosphorylation, thereby promoting tumor growth (11Wulf G.M. Ryo A. Wulf G.G. Lee S.W. Niu T. Petkova V. Lu K.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3459-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Consequently, hPin1 is of great interest for cancer therapy, and many pharmaceutical companies have chosen this protein as a molecular target for drug discovery. Human Pin1 is a two domain protein. The N-terminal WW domain mediates protein-protein interaction (8Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and targeting of hPin1 to the nucleus. Both events are regulated by phosphorylation of residue Ser16 (12Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Liou Y.C. Noel J.P. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2381-2384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The C-terminal PPIase domain catalyzes peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of pSer/pThr-Pro moieties of the substrate. In assays with phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro peptides, the isolated WW domain (hPin1WW) is completely catalytically inactive, whereas the separated PPIase domain (hPin1PPIase) is 90% as active as full-length protein (6Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.J. Shen M. Stoller G. Kullertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Although the WW domain has no catalytic activity, it binds the phosphorylated peptides with higher affinity than the PPIase domain does. Binding affinities of full-length hPin1 and its isolated WW domain toward peptide substrates only differ in a factor of two, whereas hPin1PPIase shows moderate affinity or no affinity toward them (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In binding studies with cellular substrates of hPin1, the WW domain was shown to be responsible for interaction, and hPin1PPIase does not bind any of the protein substrates (8Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the optimal binding peptide for the WW domain WFYpSPFLE (pintide) is most similar to the substrate WFYpSPR-pNa, for which the highest PPIase activity of hPin1 (k cat/K m = 20,160 mm-1 s-1, unphosphorylated 170 mm-1 s-1) has been measured (2Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Two crystal structures of full-length hPin1 are published and deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics data bank (accession numbers: 1pin and 1f8a) (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 14Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In both structures WW and PPIase domains share a common interface. The WW domain and the catalytically active PPIase domain of hPin1 are connected by a glycine- and serine-rich stretch, which plays a yet unknown role in protein function. In crystal structures this linker seems to be flexible and forms no contacts to residues of the two folded domains. The crystal structures suggest two possible conformations of hPin1. The first structure of hPin1-(1–163), co-crystallized together with an Ala-Pro peptide (14Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), exhibits the “closed” active site of PPIase domain, including a phosphate-binding α1/β1 loop, which is complexed to a sulfate ion and partly shelters the substrate binding motif, a proline ring pocket. The WW domain does not participate in substrate interaction, but together with the PPIase domain binds a PEG molecule close to the interface. In the second structure of hPin-(1–163) a 70° rotation of the phosphate-binding loop leads to an “open” conformation of the PPIase domain active site (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). No sulfate ion is complexed to the structure. In that case, the phosphorylated peptide is bound exclusively to the WW domain, resulting in a twist of its β-sheet. Both structures are recognized as two different stages during the substrate-binding event. Sulfate is hypothesized to act as phosphoryl group mimetica, which upon binding together with Ala-Pro dipeptide induces “closing” of the loop region. To shed some light onto hPin1 domain interaction in solution and to investigate the proposed induced fit mechanism upon sulfate binding, we solved the structure of full-length hPin1-(1–163) and of its PPIase-(50–163) domain in complex with sulfate using nuclear magnetic resonance. Weak interaction of domains was detected in the presence of the flexible linker in full-length hPin1, but no complex formation occurred after dissecting the protein into separated domains. NOESY techniques provide information about the integrity of the structure, indicating that the phosphate-binding loop remains in the closed conformation even in the absence of sulfate ions. Plasmid Construction—The coding DNA sequence for human Pin1 protein (RefSeq NM_006221) was used to search via BLASTN (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schåffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W.

This PCR fragment was cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of pET-28a vector to generate a fusion protein with N-terminal poly-His tag and thrombin site for purification of the protein. The DNA encoding the hPin1PPIase-(50–163) protein was constructed and amplified by PCR using the pET-28a_hPin1 gene and the following primers: forward, AATTTAAACATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGGGGAGCCTGCCAGGGTCCGCTGC (NdeI site underlined) and reverse, AAATTTGAATTCATTACTCAGTGCGGAGGATGATGTGG (EcoRI site underlined). The PCR product was NdeI/EcoRI-ligated into the vector pET-41a (Novagen). The gene for hPinPPIase is preceded by a sequence encoding for the His6 tag. To receive the gene coding for the construct hPin1WW-(6–39) PCR using pET-28a_hPin1 was performed with the following primers: forward, AAATTTAAACCATGGGCAAGCTGCCGCCCGGCTGGGAG (NcoI site underlined) and reverse, AAATTTGAATTCATTAGCCGCTGGGCCGCTCCCACTG (EcoRI site underlined). The PCR product was NcoI/EcoRI-ligated into the vector pET-42_mod_TEV, which was kindly provided by Dr. Axel Scheidig. The gene for hPinWW is preceded by a sequence encoding for glutathione S-transferase protein (GST), followed by a His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Expression and Purification of Human Pin1, Pin1PPIase, and Pin1 WW — All protein constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Codonplus RIL (Novagen). 50-ml overnight cultures of hPin1 or hPin1PPIase were harvested and resuspended into 50 ml of M9 minimal medium enriched with either [15N]ammonium chloride (1 g/liter) for uniformly labeling or with [15N]ammonium chloride (1 g/liter) and [13C]glucose (2.5 g/liter) for uniformly 15N-13C labeling (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory). Expression cultures were grown in isotope enriched minimal medium by inoculation of 1 liter with 50 ml of overnight-adapted cells. For unlabeled protein the 50-ml overnight culture was directly added to 1 liter of 2× YT (yeast extract tryptone) medium. After induction of protein expression at A 600 = 0.4 with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were shaken for a further 4 h at 37 °C, harvested, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 5,000 × g in a Beckman J2-HC centrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Cell rupture was performed using a Model 110S Microfluidizer (Microfluids, Newton, MA) in 50 mm sodium phosphate or Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, each containing 0.3 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 2 mm β-mercapto-ethanol supplemented with Complete™, EDTA-free, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). The cell lysate was ultracentrifuged at 4 °C in a Sorvall Discovery 100 centrifuge at 72,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) column (2.5 × 20 cm), equilibrated with either 50 mm sodium phosphate or Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole. hPin1 and hPin1PPIase proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient of 20 to 200 mm in the corresponding buffer, concentrated, and washed in a Microsep microconcentrator (Filtron Technology Corp., Northborough, MA) with an exclusion size of 10,000 Da. The unlabeled GST fusion WW domain construct was expressed in 2× YT medium and purified by affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow. The GST-His6 tags were removed by His-TEV protease (Invitrogen) at 4 °C directly on column. The untagged WW domain was in the flowthrough, whereas the GST-His6 tags and His6-TEV protease remained bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow. Finally, the WW domain-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated in a Centricon tube with an exclusion size of 1,000 Da. UV Spectroscopy—UV spectroscopy of the aggregation of hPin1 and all OD measurements were carried out using a CARY 100 Bio UV-visible spectrometer (Varian) equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. Fluorescence Titration Experiments—Fluorescence experiments were performed using an SLM Smart 8000 spectrofluorometer (Colora, Lorch, Germany) equipped with a PH-PC9635 photomultiplier. Sample concentration for hPin1PPIase was 1 μm. The buffer contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.6, for measurements at 12 °C. For tryptophan fluorescence, samples were excited at 295 nm and the emission intensity was measured at 348 nm. The slit widths for the experiments were 1 and 16 nm. For buffer and volume effects, corrections were done by titration with blank buffer. Data were evaluated using the program Sigmaplot 7.0 by fitting a quadratic equation given by Müller et al. (16Müller B. Restle T. Reinstein J. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3709-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In equilibrium one-to-one binding of a protein, P, and ion, I, to form a protein-ion complex, PI, can be expressed as in Equation 1. [P]+[I]⇔[PI](Eq. 1) The equilibrium dissociation constant, K d, for this reaction is as follows, Kd=koffkon=[P]·[I][PI](Eq. 2) where P(0) = [P] + [PI] and I(0) = [I] + [PI], K d and [PI] can be calculated from Equation 3. Kd=(P(0)-[PI])I(0)-[PI][PI](Eq. 3) Substitution for [PI] leads to the following equation. [PI]=I(0)+P(0)+Kd-(I(0)+P(0)+Kd)2-4I(0)·P(0)2(Eq. 4) The measured fluorescence intensity, F, is described as, F=F(0)+ΔF·[PI]P(0)(Eq. 5) where F(0) is the fluorescence intensity of the free protein and ΔF is the increase in fluorescence when adding sulfate or phosphate ions. Values for the dissociation constant (K d), the amplitude of fluorescence change, and protein concentration were allowed to vary during the fitting procedure. NMR Spectra Acquisition—Triple resonance and homonuclear experiments were performed on either a Varian Inova 600 or a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer, both equipped with shielded Z gradients. The HBHA(CO)NH spectrum was recorded on a Avance 600 spectrometer at Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany (Dr. Bermel), and 13C HSQC-TOCSY and 13C NOESY spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance 800 at the PARABIO center in Florence, Italy (Dr. Pieratelli). The temperature for all experiments was set to 300 K. Homonuclear two-dimensional experiments (TOCSY and NOESY) were recorded with unlabeled protein; 15N-heteronuclear HSQC-type spectra were acquired on uniformly 15N-labeled or 13C-15N-labeled samples. The latter protein was used to perform triple resonance spectra. All protein samples (0.6–0.8 mm) were dissolved in phosphate buffer solution (50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaSO4, 1.0 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA at pH 6.6) or in Tris/HCl buffer (50 mm, 1 mm DTT at pH 6.6) in H2O:D2O (9:1, v/v). 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane 5-sulfonate, sodium salt was used as an internal standard for calibration of proton resonances. For 15N and 13C calibrations we followed the IUPAC procedure (17Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wüthrich K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1998; 70: 117-142Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The water resonance was suppressed by applying a WATERGATE sequence (18Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar) or by presaturation. Prior to Fourier transformation, all spectra were multiplied by a sine bell square window function shifted by π/2. Generally, 2048 × 256 data points were used for acquisition of HSQC titration spectra and 1024 × 120 × 80 data points for three-dimensional edited spectra. NMR spectra were processed using the standard Bruker software XWINNMR. Analysis and visual representation of two-dimensional spectra were performed using the NDEE program package (SpinUp Inc., Dortmund, Germany) and three-dimensional spectra were analyzed with the program Aurelia (Bruker) on O2 and Octane workstations (Silicon Graphics Inc.). NMR Titration Experiments—For domain interaction, titration experiments HSQC spectra were acquired on 13C-15N double-labeled PPIase domain and unlabeled WW domain. Equivalent amounts of hPin1WW were added to a 100 μm sample of hPin1PPIase to yield 1:0.15, 1:0.30, 1:0.45, 1:0.60, 1:0.75, 1:0.9, and 1:1.05 stoichiometries of protein/protein concentration. For sulfate binding, HSQC spectra were acquired on uniformly 15N-labeled hPin1PPIase (100 μm). 1 m sodium sulfate solution was titrated to the protein to reach a final 1000:1 ratio of sulfate to protein. NMR Titration Analysis—Titration analysis was done by fitting chemical shift data to a quadratic equation as described in detail in a previous study (19Surmacz T.A. Bayer E. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. Bayer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Chemical shift differences were calculated using Equation 6 (20Ayed A. Mulder F.A.A. Yi G.S. Lu Y. Kay L.E.

If necessary, additional assignments were generated using the spectra HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HC(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, 13C HSQC TOCSY, 15N HSQC-TOCSY, 13C HSQC-NOESY, and 15N HSQC-NOESY recorded on hPin1 or hPin1PPIase samples. Distance constraints were extracted from a 1H homonuclear NOESY spectrum (mixing time, 150 ms) and 15N and 13C HSQC-NOESY spectra. φ angles were calculated on the basis of HNHA spectra and ψ angles as described previously (23Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 24Bertini I. Donaire A. Jimenez B. Luchinat C. Parigi G. Piccioli M. Poggi L. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond donors were extracted from 15N HSQC spectra recorded on protein samples in D2O. After structure calculation without hydrogen bonds, additional donors and acceptors were introduced using geometrical selection criteria (distance A-H, <3Å in 50% of the structures). 30% of backbone hydrogen bonds and all side-chain hydrogen bonds were added when corresponding bonds were present in the x-ray structures, and those bonds had favored geometry and were not excluded by neighboring distance (NOEs) and dihedral angle constraints. Based on the x-ray structure (14Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and on chemical shift changes upon titration, 10 distance constraints were used to fix the sulfate ion to the side chains of residues Lys63, Arg68, and Arg69. Structure Calculation—Structure calculation for hPin1 and the hPin1PPIase·sulfate complex was performed using the program CNS 1.0 (A. Brünger). High temperature torsion angle dynamics was performed at 50,000 K for 15 ps (1,000 steps) followed by a 15-ps cooling phase. In each case an ensemble of 100 structures was calculated from a random coil template. Ten models were selected on the basis of energetic criteria (low total energy, distance violations (NOE) < 0.2 Å and dihedral angle violations < 5° using the accept.inp routine) to form a representative ensemble of the calculated structures. An average structure for each ensemble was generated, and in the case of hPin1 subsequent energy minimization was applied. All calculations were done on a Silicon Graphics Inc. Octane workstation. The program Sybyl (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO) was used for visualization, and the programs Rasmol 2.6 (25Sayle R. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar), Molscript 2.2.1 (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), and Raster3D (27Meritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar) were used for figure production. The structures of hPin1 and hPin1PPIase·sulfate have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession numbers 1NMV and 1NMW). Error Determination—Errors of fitted K d values and geometrical and energetical data were calculated by commercial programs (Sigmaplot 7.0) and are defined as root mean square deviation, r.m.s.=∑|xi-x¯|2n-1(Eq. 7) where x̄ is the mean, x i a certain measured value, and n the total number of measured points. The WW and PPIase Domains of hPin1 Interact Only Weakly in Solution—We determined the structure of full-length hPin1-(1–163) and its PPIase domain (hPin1PPIase-(50–163)) in phosphate buffer solution (50 mm Na2SO4, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA), pH 6.6, and 27 °C using multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. 1277 (1044) distance constraints, 78 (64) hydrogen bonds as well as 82 (74) φ and 64 (52) ψ angle constraints were extracted from homo- and 13C-15N heteronuclear NOESY spectra, 15N HSQC spectra, and HNHA spectra of hPin1 and hPin1PPIase. 100 structures were calculated by torsion angle dynamics (CNS 1.0), and, on the basis of a set of exclusion parameters, an ensemble of 10 structures (Table I) was chosen to represent the final fold. Fig. 1 shows an overlay of the structures of full-length hPin1 fitted on either the WW domain (Fig. 1A) or the PPIase domain (Fig. 1B). Both domains could be determined with high precision resulting in low r.m.s.d. values over backbone atoms of 0.43 Å (WW) and 0.48 Å (PPIase), respectively. The sequence of hPin1 and the number of experimentally determined contacts, each residue is involved in, are presented in Fig. 1 (C and D). Although the WW and PPIase domain share a common interface in crystal structures, no distance constraints (NOEs) could be observed in any of the NOESY spectra between residues Ile28, Thr29, Asn30, and Ala31 and residues Asp136, Ala137, Ala140, Leu141, Ser147, and Gly148, all of which are proposed to be involved in domain interaction (13Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E.

The TIR family is divided into two subfamilies, the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) subfamilies. In mammals, the IL-1R subfamily members are important mediators of inflammation and adaptive immune responses, whereas the TLR subfamily members recognize microbial products termed PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and are critical components of the innate immune system (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 2Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Google Scholar, 3O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

The IL-1R and TLR subfamilies are distinguished through structural divergence in the extracellular domains. The IL-1R subfamily members contain immunoglobulin-like motifs, whereas the TLR subfamily members contain leucine-rich repeats. However, both subfamily members share a conserved cytoplasmic domain, the TIR domain (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 2Martin M.U. Wesche H.

Various studies have shown that the TIR domain is required for TIR family member-mediated signaling that leads to activation of transcription factors NF-κB, activating protein-1, and ATF-2 and subsequent induction of various chemokines and cytokines that are involved in host defense against the pathogens (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 2Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Google Scholar, 3O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

The signaling pathways initiated by IL-1 receptors have become a paradigm on how other TIR family receptors signal. Upon IL-1 stimulation, IL-1R1 forms a complex with IL-1RAcP, a co-receptor (6Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A. Ju G. J. Biol.

This leads to recruitment of the adapter protein MyD88 to the receptor signaling complex (10Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 11Wesche H. Henzel W.J.

Once IRAK is recruited to the receptor complex, it is activated and then dissociated from the receptor complex (13Cao Z. Yiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Google Scholar). Dissociated IRAK interacts with TRAF6, which then activates NF-κB through a kinase cascade containing TAK1 and IKK (13Cao Z. Yiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T.

Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Google Scholar). In addition to IL-1 receptor signaling, MyD88 is also involved in signaling by TLRs (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 2Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Google Scholar, 3O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Gene knock-out studies have suggested that MyD88 is required for cytokine induction triggered by a variety of ligands that signal through the TIR family members, such as IL-1β, IL-18, lipopolysaccharide, MALP-2, CpG-DNA, and poly(I·C) (17Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that poly(I·C) and lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB and JNK activation was delayed but not abolished in MyD88–/– cells. In addition, poly(I·C) and lipopolysaccharide still triggered dendritic cell maturation (17Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Google Scholar). These studies suggest that MyD88-independent pathways exist. Recently, two additional TIR domain-containing adapter molecules, TIRAP/Mal and TRIF/TICAM, were identified (18Horng T. Barton G. Medzhitov R.

It has also been shown that TIRAP is involved in signaling triggered by ligands for TLR1, TRL2, and TLR6, but not by IL-1 and IL-18, and ligands for TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 (22Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Google Scholar, 23Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Google Scholar). TRIF is the third identified TIR domain-containing adapter molecule. In addition to NF-κB, TRIF also activates IFN-β promoter (20Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Google Scholar, 21Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nature Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of TRIF inhibits TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7-mediated NF-κB activation and TLR3-mediated activation of IFN-β promoter (20Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Google Scholar, 21Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nature Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Google Scholar). So far, TRIF is the only TIR-containing adapter protein that is implied in TLR3-mediated production of IFN-β, suggesting that TRIF is involved in TLR3-activating NF-κB as well as IFN-β (20Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Google Scholar, 21Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nature Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Google Scholar). Similar with the TIR domain-containing adapter proteins, four IRAK-like molecules have been identified (24Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Yeh W.C. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 503-506Google Scholar). Although IRAK was firstly identified as a component of the IL-1R signaling complex and later shown to be recruited to the TLR signaling complexes upon ligand stimulation, gene knock-out studies have indicated that IRAK deficiency has a relatively mild effect on IL-1R and TLR signaling (25Thomas J.A. Allen J.L. Tsen M. Dubnicoff T. Danao J. Liao X.C. Cao Z. Wasserman S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 978-984Google Scholar, 26Kanakaraj P. Ngo K. Wu Y. Angulo A. Ghazal P. Harris C.A. Siekierka J.J. Peterson P.A. Fung-Leung W.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1129-1138Google Scholar). It has been shown that the kinase activity of IRAK is dispensable for IRAK function as a mediator of TIR-triggered NF-κB activation (27Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Google Scholar). IRAK-2 and IRAK-M, two other members of the IRAK family, have no kinase activity but activate NF-κB when overexpressed in 293 cells and partially restore IL-1 signaling in IRAK–/– cells (10Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 28Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Google Scholar, 29Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Google Scholar). IRAK-4, the fourth member of the IRAK family, has unique features that distinguish it from all of the other IRAK proteins. First, overexpression of IRAK-4 does not result in robust NF-κB activation. Second, expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of IRAK-4 is sufficient to inhibit IL-1-mediated NF-κB activation in cells (30Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Google Scholar). By contrast, corresponding point mutations of IRAK, IRAK-2, or IRAK-M do not have the same dominant negative effects (10Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 28Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Google Scholar, 31Cao Z. Henzel S.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Google Scholar). Third, IRAK is a direct substrate of IRAK-4, but IRAK-4 can not be phosphorylated by IRAK (30Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Google Scholar). Finally, gene knock-out studies indicate that IRAK-4 is required for signaling triggered by IL-1R and TLR engagement (32Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Google Scholar). These results suggest that IRAK-4, as well as its kinase activity, is required for TIR signaling and that IRAK-4 functions upstream of IRAK. Recently, it has been shown that IRAK-M prevents dissociation of IRAK and IRAK-4 from MyD88 and formation of IRAK·TRAF6 complexes (28Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Google Scholar). IRAK-M–/– cells exhibited increased cytokine production upon TLR/IL-1 stimulation and bacterial challenge. IRAK-M–/– mice showed increased inflammatory responses to bacterial infection and decreased tolerance to endotoxin shock (28Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Google Scholar). These data suggest that IRAK-M is a negative regulator of signaling by the TIR family members. In this study, we identified a novel TIR domain-containing adapter protein, designated as TIRP (for TIR-containing protein). Our findings suggest that TIRP interacts with various proteins involved in the TIR signaling pathways and plays a role in NF-κB activation triggered by the IL-1 receptors. Reagents—Recombinant TNF-α and IL-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), monoclonal antibodies against FLAG, and the HA (Sigma) epitopes were purchased from the indicated resources. Northern Blot Hybridization—Human multiple tissue mRNA blots were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The blots were hybridized with [32P]dCTP and [32P]dATP-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to TIRP coding sequence. The hybridization was performed in the rapid hybridization buffer (Clontech) under high stringency condition. Constructs—NF-κB luciferase reporter construct (Dr. Gary Johnson, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) and mammalian expression plasmids for FLAG-TRAF6, FLAG-TRAF6-(289–522), IKKβ, IκBα(SS/AA) (Dr. David Goeddel, Tularik Inc.), FLAG-IRAK, FLAG-IRAK-(K239S), FLAG-IRAK-4, FLAG-IRAK-4-KA, FLAG-IRAK-4-(1–191), FLAG-IRAK-M, FLAG-IL-1R1, FLAG-IL-1RAcP, Myc-MyD88 (Dr. Zhaodan Cao, Tularik Inc.), pCMV1-FLAG-TLR2, and pCMV1-FLAG-TLR4 (Dr. Bruce Beutler, Scripps Research Institute) were provided by the indicated investigators. Mammalian expression plasmids for HA-TIRP and its deletion mutants, FLAG-tagged IRAK-2, IRAK-(1–215), IRAK-2-(97–590), TRIF, and TIRAP, were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA fragments and subsequent cloning into a CMV promoter-based vector containing a 5′-HA or FLAG tag. IFN-β luciferase reporter was constructed by PCR amplification of the human IFN-β promoter fragment (–300 to + 25) and cloning into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—293 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 6-well dishes and transfected the following day by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation (33Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and where necessary, empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection receives the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.2 μg of RSV-β-galactosidase luciferase reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. Approximately sixteen hours after transfection, luciferase reporter assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit (BD Biosciences) by following the manufacturer's protocol. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent kit (TROPIX, Bedford, MA). Luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase luciferase expression levels. All of the reporter gene assays were repeated for at least three times. Data shown were from one representative experiment Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells (2 × 106) were transfected for 24 h. Transfected cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (15 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). For each immunoprecipitation, a 0.4-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 μg of the indicated monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG and 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GammaBind G Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer with 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and subsequent Western blot analysis was performed as described. All of the immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated for at least three times, and similar data were obtained. Identification and Cloning of TIRP—It has been suggested that several TIR domain-containing adapters are involved in the TIR signaling pathways and that differential use of these adapters provides the specificity in the TIR signaling pathways (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 2Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Google Scholar, 3O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

We reasoned that additional TIR domain-containing adapters might exist. Therefore, we searched the GenBank™ EST databases for sequences that encode TIR domain-containing proteins. This effort identified multiple human EST clones that encode a protein designated as TIRP. GenBank™ accession number for the longest EST clone is BQ438847. Further BLAST searches also identified mouse ortholog of human TIRP. Sequence comparisons suggest that human and mouse TIRPs share ∼70% identity at amino acid level (Fig. 1A). TIRP contains a TIR domain at the middle, which is mostly conserved with that of TRIF/TICAM (Fig. 1B) (18Horng T. Barton G. Medzhitov R. Nature Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar, 19Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E.

Northern blot analysis suggests that human TIRP mRNA is expressed in most examined tissues including the spleen, prostate, testis, uterus, small intestine, colon, peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas (Fig. 1C). Three transcripts of different sizes, ∼3.8, 3.6, and 2.0 kb, respectively, were detected, and these transcripts were differentially expressed in the tissues (Fig. 1C). TIRP Interacts with IL-1R1 and IL-1RAcP—Previously, it has been shown that the TIR domain-containing adapter proteins interact with TIR receptors (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 2Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Google Scholar, 3O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

We determined whether TIRP interacts with IL-1R1, IL-1RAcP, and TLR2. To do this, we transfected expression plasmids for C-terminal FLAG-tagged receptors and N-terminal HA-tagged TIRP into 293 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that TIRP interacted with IL-1R1 and IL-1RAcP but not with TLR2 and TLR4 (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that TIRP is a component of the IL-1 receptor signaling complex. TIRP Interacts with Other TIR-containing Adapter Proteins—It has been reported that TIR-containing adapter proteins can form heterodimers (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Google Scholar, 2Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Google Scholar, 3O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

To test whether TIRP can interact with known TIR-containing adapter proteins, we transfected expression plasmids for TIRP and MyD88, TIRAP, and TRIF into 293 cells, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that TIRP interacts with TIRAP and TRIF (Fig. 2B) but not with MyD88 (data not shown). These data suggest that TIRP selectively interacts with other TIR-containing adapter proteins. TIRP Interacts with IRAKs—MyD88, TIRAP, and TRIF function as adapters to recruit IRAKs into the signaling complexes of TIR family members (10Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 11Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Google Scholar, 12Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P.

Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Google Scholar). We examined whether TIRP also interacts with IRAKs. In transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, TIRP did not interact with wild-type IRAK and IRAK-4 but interacted with kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK and IRAK-4 (Fig. 3A). These results are similar to MyD88, which has been shown to interact with kinase-inactive mutant but not with wild type IRAK. In transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, TIRP also interacted with wild-type IRAK-2 and IRAK-M (Fig. 3A), two IRAK family members that have no kinase activity. Taken together, these data suggest that TIRP only interacts with kinase-inactive IRAKs. TIRP Interacts with TRAF6 —It has been shown that TRAF6 is associated with activated IRAK (13Cao Z. Yiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Google Scholar). We examined whether TIRP is associated with TRAF6. To do this, we transfected FLAG-tagged TRAF6 and HA-tagged TIRP into 293 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These experiments indicated that TIRP interacted with TRAF6 but not with TRAF5 (Fig. 3B). Also, the TRAF domain of TRAF6 was sufficient for its interaction with TIRP (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that TIRP specifically interacts with TRAF6. We next determined which domain of TIRP is responsible for its interaction with TRAF6. TIRP contains a conserved TIR domain at the middle flanked by unconserved N- and C-terminal domains. We made HA-tagged TIRP deletion mutants containing one individual domain or combinations of different domains. Transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the TIR domain is required and sufficient for the interaction of TIRP with TRAF6 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, we found that the TIR domain of TIRP contains a PRERT motif at amino acid 181, which is conserved with the defined TRAF6 binding motif PXEXX (34Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Google Scholar). Overexpression of TIRP Activates NF-κB but Not IFN-β Promoter—Since TIRP interacts with proteins involved in signaling by TIR family members, we determined whether TIRP activates NF-κB. We transfected a mammalian expression plasmid for TIRP into 293 cells and performed NF-κB luciferase reporter gene assays. These experiments indicated that TIRP could activate NF-κB (Fig. 4A). However, TIRP activated NF-κB to a lesser degree than MyD88, TRIF, and TIRAP in the same experiments (Fig. 4A). Previously, it has been shown that TRIF can potently activate IFN-β promoter. To examine whether TIRP can activate IFN-β promoter, we transfected 293 cells (2 × 105) with various amounts of TIRP plasmid ranging from 0.01 to 3.2 μg and then performed IFN-β luciferase reporter gene assays. The result indicated that TIRP could not activate IFN-β promoter regardless of the transfected TIRP plasmid concentration (Fig. 4B) (data not shown). In these experiments, MyD88 and TIRAP also did not activate IFN-β promoter, whereas TRIF potently activated IFN-β promoter (Fig. 4B). Because TIRP can weakly activate NF-κB, we determined whether it potentiates IL-1R1- and IL-1AcP-mediated NF-κB activation. Previously, it has been shown that the overexpression of IL-1R1 or IL-1RAcP alone weakly activates NF-κB. In reporter gene assays, we found that TIRP could synergy with IL-1R1 or IL-1-RAcP to activate NF-κB (Fig. 4C). A TIRP Dominant Negative Mutant Inhibits NF-κB Activation Mediated by IL-1 Receptors but Not by TRAF6 and IKKβ— Previously, it has been shown that the TIR domains of MyD88, TRIF, and TIRAP function as dominant negative mutants to inhibit signaling by the TIR family members (10Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 11Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Google Scholar, 12Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C.

Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Google Scholar). We examined whether the TIR domain of TIRP can inhibit NF-κB activation triggered by IL-1 receptors. In reporter gene assays, we found that the TIR domain of TIRP, TIRP-(78–171), significantly inhibited NF-κB activation mediated by overexpression of IL-1R1 and IL-1RacP but not by overexpression of TRAF6 and IKKβ (Fig. 5A). In these experiments, TIRP-(78–171) did not inhibit TLR4 and only slightly inhibited TLR2-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5A). In reporter gene assays, TIRP-(78–171) also inhibited NF-κB activation triggered by IL-1 but not by TNF (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that TIRP is specifically involved in IL-1-triggered NF-κB activation. NF-κB Activation by TIRP Is Inhibited by Dominant Negative Mutants of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKβ—To determine the molecular order of TIRP in the IL-1 signaling pathways, we determined whether TIRP-mediated NF-κB activation is inhibited by dominant negative mutants of proteins involved in IL-1 signaling pathways. In reporter gene assays, we found that dominant negative mutants of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKβ as well as IκBα-undegradable mutant potently inhibited TIRP-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 5C). In these experiments, dominant negative mutants of MyD88 and IRAK-4 did not inhibit TIRP-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that TIRP functions upstream of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKβ in IL-1 receptor-mediated NF-κB activation pathways. Previously, three TIR-containing adapter proteins have been reported, including MyD88, TIRAP/Mal, and TRIF/TICAM. In this paper, we describe the identification of TIRP, the fourth member of this family. TIRP shares many similar properties with the other three TIR-containing adapter proteins. It contains a conserved TIR domain and is associated with IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP, suggesting that TIRP plays a role in IL-1 signaling. Previous studies have shown that MyD interacts with kinase-inactive mutant of IRAK but not wild-type IRAK. It has been proposed that MyD88 recruits inactive IRAK to IL-1R complex. Once IRAK is activated in the complex, it dissociates with MyD88 and then interacts with TRAF6 (10Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Google Scholar, 11Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Google Scholar, 12Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. DiMarco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Google Scholar). Similar to MyD88, TIRP interacts with kinase-inactive mutants of IRAK and IRAK-4 but not with their wild-type counterparts. These data suggest that TIRP may also interact with inactive IRAK and IRAK-4 in cells and dissociate when they are activated. In addition to kinase-inactive IRAK and IRAK-4 mutants, TIRP also interacts with IRAK-2 and IRAK-M, two IRAK family members that are kinase-inactive. These data further support our hypothesis that TIRP interacts with kinase-inactive IRAKs. In addition to IRAKs, TIRP also interacts with TRAF6. This interaction is mediated by the TRAF domain of TRAF6. TIRP does not interact with TRAF5, a TRAF family member that is involved in signaling by TNF receptor family members. The TIR domain of TIRP is required and sufficient for its interaction with TRAF6. These data suggest that TIRP specifically interacts with TRAF6 and other signaling proteins involved in IL-1 signaling pathways. Overexpression of TIRP activates NF-κB but not IFN-β promoter. A dominant negative mutant of TIRP (TIRP-(78–171)) inhibits IL-1-induced but not TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Conversely, dominant negative mutants of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKβ inhibited TIRP-mediated NF-κB activation. These data suggest that TIRP functions upstream of IRAK, IRAK-2, TRAF6, and IKKβ in the IL-1-induced NF-κB activation pathway. Because IL-1 is unable to activate NF-κB in certain MyD88-deficient cells, it is possible that these cells do not express TIRP. Alternatively, TIRP is not able to complement MyD88 deficiency and both proteins are required for IL-1-induced NF-κB activation. Although TIRP interacts with kinase-inactive mutant of IRAK-4, a dominant negative mutant of IRAK-4 did not inhibit TIRP-induced NF-κB activation. It is possible that IRAK-4 functions upstream of TIRP in IL-1 signaling. In conclusion, we identified TIRP, a novel TIR domain-containing adapter protein that is involved in IL-1-triggered NF-κB activation pathways. It should be pointed out that our characterization of TIRP was based on the mammalian overexpression systems. Further experiments, such as analysis of TIRP knock-out mice, will be needed to confirm a role of TIRP in IL-1 or other TIR signaling pathways. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2129410980,"Inhibition of autophagic proteolysis by hypoosmotic or amino acid-induced hepatocyte swelling requires osmosignaling toward p38MAPK; however, the upstream osmosensing and signaling events are unknown. These were studied in the intact perfused rat liver with a preserved in situ environment of hepatocytes. It was found that hypoosmotic hepatocyte swelling led to an activation of Src (but not FAK), Erks, and p38MAPK, which was prevented by the integrin inhibitory hexapeptide GRGDSP, but not its inactive analogue GRGESP. Src inhibition by PP-2 prevented hypoosmotic MAP kinase activation, indicating that the integrin/Src system is located upstream in the osmosignaling toward p38MAPK and Erks. Inhibition of the integrin/Src system by the RGD motif-containing peptide or PP-2 also prevented the inhibition of proteolysis and the decrease in autophagic vacuole volume, which is otherwise observed in response to hypoosmotic or glutamine/glycine-induced hepatocyte swelling. These inhibitors, however, did not affect swelling-independent proteolysis inhibition by phenylalanine. In line with a role of p38MAPK in triggering the volume regulatory decrease (RVD), PP-2 and the RGD peptide blunted RVD in response to hypoosmotic cell swelling. The data identify integrins and Src as upstream events in the osmosignaling toward MAP kinases, proteolysis, and RVD. They further point to a role of integrins as osmo- and mechanosensors in the intact liver, which may provide a link between cell volume and cell function. Inhibition of autophagic proteolysis by hypoosmotic or amino acid-induced hepatocyte swelling requires osmosignaling toward p38MAPK; however, the upstream osmosensing and signaling events are unknown. These were studied in the intact perfused rat liver with a preserved in situ environment of hepatocytes. It was found that hypoosmotic hepatocyte swelling led to an activation of Src (but not FAK), Erks, and p38MAPK, which was prevented by the integrin inhibitory hexapeptide GRGDSP, but not its inactive analogue GRGESP. Src inhibition by PP-2 prevented hypoosmotic MAP kinase activation, indicating that the integrin/Src system is located upstream in the osmosignaling toward p38MAPK and Erks. Inhibition of the integrin/Src system by the RGD motif-containing peptide or PP-2 also prevented the inhibition of proteolysis and the decrease in autophagic vacuole volume, which is otherwise observed in response to hypoosmotic or glutamine/glycine-induced hepatocyte swelling. These inhibitors, however, did not affect swelling-independent proteolysis inhibition by phenylalanine. In line with a role of p38MAPK in triggering the volume regulatory decrease (RVD), PP-2 and the RGD peptide blunted RVD in response to hypoosmotic cell swelling. The data identify integrins and Src as upstream events in the osmosignaling toward MAP kinases, proteolysis, and RVD. They further point to a role of integrins as osmo- and mechanosensors in the intact liver, which may provide a link between cell volume and cell function. Changes in cell hydration within a narrow, physiological range markedly affect carbohydrate and protein metabolism, hepatic bile flow, gene expression, and cellular susceptibility to environmental stress (1Häussinger D.

The regulation of cell function by cell hydration requires structures, which sense hydration changes (osmosensing) and intracellular signaling pathways toward effector sites (osmosignaling). Progress has been made in identifying signal transduction pathways linking cell volume changes to alterations in cell function (7Häussinger D. Schliess F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, the MAPK, 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AV, autophagic vacuole; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, phosphoinositide; RVD, regulatory volume decrease. p38MAPK, activation is critical for creating volume-regulatory ion fluxes in response to hypoosmotic swelling in perfused rat liver (8vom Dahl S. Schliess F. Graf D. Häussinger D. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and HTC liver cells (9Feranchak A.P. Berl T. Capasso J. Wojtaszek P.A. Han J. Fitz J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Likewise, proteolysis inhibition by cell swelling strongly depends on activation of the p38MAPK in perfused rat liver (10Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Specific inhibition of the p38MAPK abolishes the antiproteolytic effects exerted by hypoosmolarity and glutamine, but is without effect on cell swelling under these conditions (10Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another component involved in swelling-dependent proteolysis inhibition is the microtubular system. Colchicine blocks hypoosmotic proteolysis inhibition, but not p38MAPK activation upon hypoosmolarity (11vom Dahl S. Dombrowski F. Schliess F. Pfeifer U. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data show that the microtubule-dependent element in hydration-dependent proteolysis signaling is obviously localized downstream of p38MAPK activation. In contrast to agonists that cause changes of cell hydration, the antiproteolytic action of non-swelling amino acids, e.g. phenylalanine, resides on the activation of other signaling events, such as activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K kinase) (12Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Meijer A.M. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 243: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), which can clearly be differentiated from the swelling-related antiproteolytic signaling cascade (15van Sluijters D.A. Dubbelhuis P.F. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Whereas in bacteria, plants, and fungi two-component histidine kinases were identified to be involved in sensing of and subsequent adaptation to adverse osmotic conditions (16Loomis W.F. Shaulsky G. Wang N. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanisms of osmosensing in mammalian cells are far from being understood. Integrins are candidates to be involved in mechanotransduction, i.e. the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into covalent modifications of signaling components. Integrins are heterodimers with each subunit having a single transmembrane domain. They establish cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and bind inside the cell to cytoplasmic proteins, which in turn interact with different signal transduction components and the cytoskeleton (for reviews see Refs. 17Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar and 18Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). In normal liver, the most important integrins are α1β1, α5β1, and α9β1 (19Carloni V. Mazzocca A. Pantaleo P. Cordella C. Laffi G. Gentilini P. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Hsu S.L. Cheng C. Shi Y.R.

Hepatology. 2001; 34: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The present study investigates the role of integrins and Src in hypoosmotic signaling toward proteolysis inhibition and cell volume regulation in the isolated perfused rat liver, which most authentically represents the three-dimensional hepatocyte anchoring to the extracellular matrix, preserved cell polarity, intact cytoskeleton, and structural/functional cell-cell interactions. Using the integrin antagonistic peptide GRGDSP and the Src kinase inhibitor PP-2, an integrin-dependent activation of Src kinases was localized upstream of swelling-induced p38MAPK signaling toward inhibition of autophagy. In contrast, the antiproteolytic effect of phenylalanine, which does not involve cell swelling and p38MAPK does not depend on GRGDSP-sensitive integrin action and Src activation. Consistent with inhibition of osmosignaling toward p38MAPK, GRGDSP and PP2 effectively antagonize the volume regulatory response triggered by hypoosmotic swelling. The findings suggest a role of integrins in hepatic osmosensing and transforming hepatocyte swelling into a physiological response. Liver Perfusion—Livers from male Wistar rats (160–230 g), fed a standard diet, were perfused in an open non-recirculating manner at a flow rate of 3.5–4.5 ml/min/g. The perfusion medium was bicarbonate-buffered Krebs-Henseleit saline plus lactate (2.1 mmol/liter) and pyruvate (0.3 mmol/liter), incubated with O2/CO2 (19:1, v/v), at a temperature of 37 °C. For changing the osmolarity, the NaCl concentration (115 mmol/liter) was varied, resulting in corresponding changes of osmolarity. Additions were made either by the use of micropumps (20 μl/min) or by dissolution in Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO. Viability of the livers was assessed by monitoring effluent oxygen concentration and measurement of lactate dehydrogenase leakage from livers, which did not exceed 15–20 milliunits/min/g of liver. Monitoring and Assays in Liver Perfusion—Effluent perfusate pH was monitored continuously with a pH-sensitive electrode, and the perfusion pressure was detected by a pressure transducer (Hugo Sachs Electronics, Hugstetten, Germany). Basal portal pressure was 3–5 cm H2O and was not affected by the compounds used in this study. The intracellular water space was calculated from the difference of washout profiles of simultaneously infused [14C]urea and [3H]inulin as described previously (22vom Dahl S. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In fed animals, the cell water under control conditions was 551 ± 10 μl/g (n = 28). Proteolysis was determined in separate perfusion experiments as 3H label release from rats that had been injected intraperitoneally with 50 μCi of l-4,5-[3H]leucine 16 h prior to the perfusion experiment as described previously (23Häussinger D. Hallbrucker C. vom Dahl S. Lang F. Gerok W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The rate of proteolysis was set to 100% under normotonic control conditions, due to different labeling of hepatic proteins after intraperitoneal injection, and the extent of inhibition of proteolysis was determined 30 min after institution of the respective condition, a time point, when a new steady state had been reached. In bile experiments, livers were perfused with 100 μmol/liter [3H]taurocholate (1 μCi/liter). Bile was collected at 2-min intervals. Bile flow was assessed by gravimetry, assuming a specific mass of 1 g/ml. Taurocholate excretion into bile was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the radioactivity present in bile, based on the specific radioactivity of [3H]taurocholate in influent perfusate. Preparation of Cultured Hepatocytes—Liver parenchymal cells were isolated from the livers of male Wistar rats (200 g body wt.) by collagenase perfusion as described previously by Meijer et al. (24Meijer A.J. Gimpel J.A. Deleeuw G.A. Tager J.M. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7728-7738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were plated on fibronectin-coated culture dishes (17 μg/dish, diameter 60 mm, ∼1 × 106 cells) and maintained in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) with 6 mmol/liter glucose, equilibrated in a humidified atmosphere (air/CO2, 19:1, v/v) at 37 °C. After 4 h in KHB, the cells were cultured for another 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, insulin (100 nmol/liter), 1% glutamine, dexamethasone (100 nmol/liter), sodium selenite (30 nmol/liter), and aprotinin (1 μg/ml). Fresh DMEM was added after 24 h. After a total cultivation time of 48 h, cells were cultured in normoosmotic DMEM without additions containing 1000 mg/liter glucose for 4 h. After starvation for 4 h in normoosmotic medium, cells were either exposed to hypoosmolar (205 mosmol/liter) or normoosmotic control medium (305 mosmol/liter) for 2 min. If indicated, cells were incubated with PP-2 (20 μmol/liter) or GRGDSP (250 μmol/liter) 20 min prior to installing hypoosmolarity or the normoosmotic control condition, respectively. At the end of experimental treatment, medium was removed from the culture, and cells were immediately lysed at 4 °C using lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter NaF, 10 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter sodium vanadate, 20 mmol/liter β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The homogenized lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, and protein analyses were performed as described below. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Tissue Processing for Immune Complex Kinase Assays and Western Blot Analysis—Rat livers were perfused for 130 min with isoosmotic perfusion medium, thereafter with hypoosmotic perfusion medium (185 mosmol/liter). The desired osmolarity was achieved by omission of 60 mm NaCl. When indicated, inhibitors were present for 30 min prior to institution of hypoosmotic perfusion conditions or addition of amino acids. For immune complex assay and Western blot determinations, liver lobes from perfused liver were excised at the respective time points (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after installation of hypoosmotic perfusion conditions), dounced with an Ultraturrax (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) at 0 °C in lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter NaF, 10 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter sodium vanadate, 20 mmol/liter β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture. Immune Complex Kinase Assays and Western Blot Analysis—The lysed samples from the perfused liver or hepatocytes were centrifuged at 4 °C, and aliquots of the supernatant were incubated with 1.5 μg of an antibody recognizing Erk-1 and Erk-2 for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by using protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma), washed three times with lysis buffer and four times with kinase buffer (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol), and incubated with 1 mg/ml MBP in the presence of 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 2× gel loading buffer, and activity of Erk-2 was monitored via autoradiography after sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% gel). To perform SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis an identical volume of 2× gel loading buffer containing 200 mmol/liter dithiothreitol (pH 6.8) was added to the lysates. After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (50 μg protein/lane, 7.5% gels). Following electrophoresis, gels were equilibrated with transfer buffer (39 mmol/liter glycine, 48 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 0.03% SDS, 20% methanol). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked overnight in 1% bovine serum albumin solubilized in 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mmol/liter NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 3–4 h with antibodies raised against [Tyr(P)418]Src, [Tyr(P)529]Src, Src, [Tyr(P)397]FAK, FAK, [Thr(P)180/Tyr(P)182]p38MAPK and p38 at a dilution of 1:5,000. Following washing and incubation for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit-IgG antibody (1:10,000), the blots were washed again and developed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). Densitometric analysis was performed with the E. A. S. Y. RH system (Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany). Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopic morphometry, fixation of the liver lobes was performed as described previously (11vom Dahl S. Dombrowski F. Schliess F. Pfeifer U. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by perfusion of glutaraldehyde (3%) in Krebs-Henseleit medium for 30 s. From the fixed livers small cubes of ∼1 mm3 were cut, postfixed for 2 h with 2% osmium tetroxide, 2% uranylacetate, and 1.5% lead citrate in PBS buffer, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections for electron microscopy were placed on copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and were examined with a EM 900 electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany). Quantitative Evaluation of Intracellular Organelles—The autophagic vacuoles were defined as bits of cytoplasm sequestered from the remaining cytoplasm by one or two membranes. The morphology of autophagic vacuoles has been described in detail elsewhere (26Pfeifer U. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 152-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The square fields, which were defined by the copper grids (127 μm × 127 μm) were used as test fields and systematically searched for autophagic vacuoles at a magnification of ×10,500. The area of cytoplasm that was examined ranged between 7,000 and 12,000 μm2 (n = 6). The area of the AV was measured at magnification ×21,000. Low power electron micrographs of the test fields were mounted, and the area of the hepatocytic cytoplasm was calculated by count pointing method (144 test points). The fractional volume of autophagic vacuoles, which is defined as the volume of autophagic vacuoles per volume of liver cell cytoplasm (Vav/Vc) was calculated as described previously (10Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Pfeifer U. Lab. Invest. 1984; 50: 348-354PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Laser Microscopy—For indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, rat livers were perfused for 120 min under isoosmotic conditions, and liver lobes were instantly fixed for cryosectioning in liquid nitrogen. When present, latrunculin B (2 μmol/liter) had been added 30 min prior to fixation of liver lobes. Liver sections were obtained using a cryotom CM 350 S (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) at a thickness of 5 μm. Air-dried samples were fixed using for 10 min at 4 °C and washed five times with ice-cold PBS. Immediately after washing samples were incubated with Phalloidin-FITC (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumine for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently samples were washed again three times with ice-cold PBS. Immunostained liver perfusion samples were analyzed with a Leica TCS NT confocal laser scanning system (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) DM IRB inverted microscope. Images were acquired from a channel at a wavelength of 488 nm. Materials—The integrin antagonistic GRGDSP and the inactive control peptide GRGESP were from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). The antibody raised against Erk-1/Erk-2 was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Antibodies recognizing [Tyr(P)397]FAK, [Tyr(P)418]Src, [Tyr(P)529]-Src and total Src were from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Anti-[Thr(P)180/Tyr(P)182]p38MAPK antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). The antibodies raised against total FAK and total p38 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. [γ-32P]ATP, l-[4,5-3H]leucine, [3H]inulin, and [14C]urea were from Amersham Biosciences. l-lactic acid was from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Glutaraldehyde was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). PP-2 was from Biomol (Plymouth, PA), and PP-3 and latrunculin B were from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and gentamicin were purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). Fibronectin was purchased from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany). Enzymes were from Roche Applied Science. Insulin, dexamethasone, and glutamine were from Sigma. Penicillin/streptomycin was from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Statistics—Data from different perfusion experiments are given as means ± S.E. (number of independent experiments). Conditions were compared by Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Involvement of Integrins and Src in Hypoosmotic Signal Transduction—Hypoosmotic (185 mosmol/liter) liver perfusion induced a transient Src phosphorylation on Tyr418, which was maximal (2.8 ± 0.6-fold, n = 4) at about 2 min. The increase in Src-Tyr418 phosphorylation was accompanied by a transient dephosphorylation of Src on Tyr529. According to earlier findings (10Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Schliess F. vom Dahl S. Häussinger D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2001; 382: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), hypoosmolarity induced a transient activation of the MAP kinases Erk-1/Erk-2 and p38, which was maximal between 5 and 10 min (Fig. 1). Normoosmotic control perfusions were without effect on Erk-1/Erk-2 and p38MAPK (10Häussinger D. Schliess F. Dombrowski F. vom Dahl S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and neither altered Src phosphorylation on Tyr418 and Tyr529, nor FAK phosphorylation on Tyr397 (Fig. 1). Infusion of the integrin antagonistic peptide GRGDSP (10 μmol/liter), but not the inactive analogue GRGESP (10 μmol/liter) prevented the hypoosmotic stimulation of Src-Tyr418 phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinases Erk-1/Erk-2 and p38 (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Likewise, PP-2 (250 nmol/liter), an inhibitor of Src kinases (29Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), abolished the hypoosmotic increase of Src-Tyr418 phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinases (Fig. 1B and Table 1). In the presence of the inhibitors no significant effect of hypoosmotic perfusion on Src-Tyr529 phosphorylation could be observed (Table 1).Table IEffects of the integrin antagonistic peptide GRGDSP, its inactive analogue GRGESP and the Src inhibitor PP-2 on hypoosmotic Src-Tyr418 and dual phosphorylation of p38 and Erk-1/Erk-2 activation in perfused rat liverConditionInhibitor[Tyr(P)418]Src[Thr(P)180/Tyr(P)182]p38[Tyr(P)529]SrcErk-1/Erk-2HypoosmoticNone2.8 ± 0.6aResponse significantly different from isoosmotic control (p < 0.05)1.9 ± 0.2aResponse significantly different from isoosmotic control (p < 0.05)0.7 ± 0.1aResponse significantly different from isoosmotic control (p < 0.05)2.1 ± 0.2aResponse significantly different from isoosmotic control (p < 0.05)HypoosmoticGRGDSP1.2 ± 0.2bResponse significantly different from the response evoked by hypoosmolarity in absence of inhibitory compounds (p < 0.05)1.1 ± 0.1bResponse significantly different from the response evoked by hypoosmolarity in absence of inhibitory compounds (p < 0.05)0.7 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.1bResponse significantly different from the response evoked by hypoosmolarity in absence of inhibitory compounds (p < 0.05)HypoosmoticGRGESP2.1 ± 0.3aResponse significantly different from isoosmotic control (p < 0.05)2.7 ± 0.8cResponse different from the isoosmotic control (p = 0.06)0.6 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.1aResponse significantly different from isoosmotic control (p < 0.05)HypoosmoticPP-21.1 ± 0.2dResponse significantly different from the response evoked by hypoosmolarity in absence of inhibitory compounds (p = 0.07)1.1 ± 0.2bResponse significantly different from the response evoked by hypoosmolarity in absence of inhibitory compounds (p < 0.05)0.7 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.1bResponse significantly different from the response evoked by hypoosmolarity in absence of inhibitory compounds (p < 0.05)Data are from perfused rat liver exposed to hypoosmotic perfusion medium (185 mosmol/liter), without further pretreatment or in the presence of GRGDSP (10 μmol/liter), GRGESP (10 μmol/liter), or PP-2 (250 nmol/liter), as described in Fig. 1.

Hypoosmolarity induced an 2.7 ± 0.6-fold increase of Src-Tyr418 phosphorylation, which was blunted to 0.8 ± 0.1- and 1.1 ± 0.1-fold in the presence of GRGDSP (250 μmol/liter) or PP-2 (20 μmol/liter), respectively (n = 5). In a similar way, GRGDSP and PP-2 reduced the hypoosmotic p38 activation from 2.3 ± 0.4-fold under hypoosmotic control conditions to 0.9 ± 0.1- and 1.3 ± 0.2-fold (n = 5) in the presence of the respective inhibitors (Fig. 2). The findings support the suggestion that direct rather than indirect effects of GRGDSP and PP-2 account for the inhibitory effects found in the intact liver. The Integrin/Src System Is Involved in Regulatory Volume Decrease—As shown recently, p38MAPK activation in response to hypoosmotic cell swelling is also involved in regulatory volume decrease (RVD) (8vom Dahl S. Schliess F. Graf D. Häussinger D. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which manifests within about 10 min of hypoosmotic exposure as a net K+ and Cl- release from the hepatocytes through Ba2+-, DIDS-, and quinidine-sensitive ion channels (30Häussinger D. Stehle T. Lang F. Hepatology. 1990; 11: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This RVD response only partially restores cell volume, and after its completion the cells are left in a slightly swollen state (30Häussinger D. Stehle T. Lang F. Hepatology. 1990; 11: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When perfused livers are suddenly exposed to hypoosmotic fluid (225 mosmol/liter), a net K+ release of 12.2 + 0.5 μmol/g of liver is observed, which is completed within 415 ± 11 s (Table 3), and the residual cell volume increase after completion of RVD is 13.4 + 0.8% (Table 2). As shown recently (8vom Dahl S. Schliess F. Graf D. Häussinger D. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), inhibition of p38MAPK blunts and delays this volume regulatory net K+ release and renders the cells in a more swollen state. As shown in Table 2, prevention of swelling-induced p38MAPK activation by GRGDSP or PP-2 rendered the cel"

Previous evidence has shown that apoptotic death of embryonic cortical neurons treated with the DNA damaging agent camptothecin is dependent upon the tumor suppressor p53, an upstream death mediator, and more distal death effectors such as caspases. We show here that the calcium-regulated cysteine proteases, calpains, are activated during DNA damage induced by camptothecin treatment. Moreover, calpain deficiency, calpastatin expression, or pharmacological calpain inhibitors prevent the death of embryonic cortical neurons, indicating the important role of calpain in DNA damage-induced death. Calpain inhibition also significantly reduced and delayed the induction of p53. Consistent with the actions of calpains upstream of p53 and the proximal nature of p53 death signaling, calpain inhibition inhibited cytochrome c release and DEVD-AFC cleavage activity. Taken together, our results indicate that calpains are a key mediator of p53 induction and consequent caspase-dependent neuronal death due to DNA damage.

DNA damage is a critical initiator of delayed neuronal death and is thought to play an important role in neurodegenerative processes and stroke (1Stefanis L. Burke R.E. Greene L.A. Curr. Opin.

As an example, DNA damage is thought to occur prior to DNA fragmentation associated with the late apoptotic program following ischemic injury (4Chen J. Jin K. Chen M. Pei W. Kawaguchi K. Greenberg D.A. Simon R.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 232-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA damage has also been implicated in excitotoxic damage and oxidative stress, two mechanisms widely associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease (5Mandir A.S.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which p53 is activated by DNA damage in neurons is not fully understood. Calpains are calcium-dependent neutral proteases that have been implicated in a variety of physiologic and pathological conditions, including regulation of cell cycle progression, neuronal plasticity, and initiation of neuronal cell death (16Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Calpains μ and m are the two most ubiquitously expressed forms of calpains, and they require interaction with a small regulatory calpain subunit encoded by the gene capn4 to function properly. The importance of calpains is underscored by the observation that mice deficient in the calpain small regulatory subunit die embryonically, perhaps due to cardiovascular defects (17Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 18Zimmerman U.J. Boring L. Pak J.H. Mukerjee N. Wang K.K. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). With respect to calpain involvement in neuronal death, pharmacological calpain inhibitors have been shown to protect neurons from a variety of death stimuli, including ischemic/excitotoxic insults, both in vitro (19Jordan J.

However, the inhibitors utilized are known to inhibit targets other than calpains, and, therefore, the role of calpain in neuronal death has been unclear and controversial. The regulation of calpain is complex and includes a requirement for calcium (16Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), the endogenous cellular calpain inhibitor calpastatin (25Melloni E. De Tullio R. Averna M. Tedesco I. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and translocation to membranous compartments (26Chakrabarti A.K. Dasgupta S. Gadsden Sr., R.H. Hogan E.L.

Calpains are reported to modulate a wide variety of intracellular signaling pathways by targeted cleavage of substrate proteins, including the Cdk5 activator p35 (28Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J.

A. 1984; 81: 3572-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and spectrin (33Roberts-Lewis J.M. Savage M.J. Marcy V.R. Pinsker L.R. Siman R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calpains are also thought to cleave and inactivate caspases, the executers of the death signal in apoptosis (34Chua B.T. Guo K. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5131-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The diversity of the substrates cleaved by calpain highlights the varied nature of calpain-mediated signals and demonstrates its ability to regulate various cell functions, possibly by modulating different proteins under different contexts. We currently examined the requirement for calpain activation in the death of cultured cortical neurons evoked by DNA damage. Multiple lines of evidence based upon studies of neuronally differentiated calpain-deficient stem cells and calpastatin overexpression, as well as multiple pharmacological calpain inhibitors, strongly suggest the involvement of calpains in neuronal death induced by DNA damage. Moreover, we find that calpain inhibition reduces p53 activation and consequent mitochondrial death effector signals. This evidence implicates p53 as a critical step by which calpains transduce the death signal. Materials—Camptothecin was obtained from Sigma. DEVD-AFC was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). PD 150606 and MDL 28170 were obtained from Calbiochem. Generation of Recombinant Adenovirus—The recombinant adenoviral vectors were constructed using the AdEasy system as described previously (35He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Calpastatin (RNCAST104), subcloned previously into a pAdLox (36Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was excised using BamHI and EcoRI. The sequence encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein kinase; ATR, ATM and Rad-3-related protein kinase. was excised from pEGFP-C (Clontech) using AfeI and SalI. Both fragments were ligated into pShuttle-CMV to produce pShuttle-CMV-EGFP-Calpastatin. Calpastatin and the control EGFP adenovirus were amplified in 293 cells and purified over CsCl gradients. For primary cell infections, virus (multiplicity of infection 10) was added to neural cultures at the time of plating. Culture and Survival of Cortical Neurons—Mouse cortical neurons were cultured from embryonic day 15 mice as described previously (11Giovanni A. Keramaris E. Morris E.J. Hou S.T. O'Hare M. Dyson N.J. Robertson G.S. Slack R.S. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11553-11560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Neurons were plated into 24-well dishes (∼200,000 cells/well) or 6-well dishes (2–4 million cells/well) coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml) in serum-free medium (N2/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with 6 mg/ml d-glucose, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 60 μm putrescine, and 30 nm selenium. One to two days after initial plating, the medium was supplemented with camptothecin (10 μm) alone or with calpain inhibitors as indicated in the text and figures. At appropriate times of culture, cells were lysed, and the numbers of viable cells were evaluated. Briefly, cells were lysed in 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (0.1 × PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2, and cetyldimethylethylammonium bromide (0.5 g/100 ml), which disrupts cells but leaves the nuclei intact. Ten microliters of sample from each culture were loaded onto a hemacytometer, and the number of healthy intact nuclei was evaluated by phase microscopy. Nuclei that displayed characteristics of blebbing, disruption of nuclear membrane, phase-bright apoptotic bodies, and chromatin margination were excluded. All experimental points are expressed as a percentage of cells plated on day 0. Alternatively, cells were collected and analyzed for biochemical analyses as described below. Culture and Survival of Stem Cell-derived Neurons—Mice heterozygous deficient for the small subunit of calpain (Capn4+/-) were bred, and the embryos were isolated at embryonic day 10.5. Mouse forebrain stem cells were cultured from embryonic telencephalons as described previously (Ref. 37Tropepe V. Sibilia M. Ciruna B.G. Rossant J. Wagner E.F. van der Kooy D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar; modified). Embryos were genotyped as described previously (17Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Stem cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml and allowed to form neurospheres in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml basic fibroblast growth factor as described previously (37Tropepe V. Sibilia M. Ciruna B.G. Rossant J. Wagner E.F. van der Kooy D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). To passage, cells were triturated to obtain a single cell suspension using a flame-polished glass pipette. To differentiate the neural stem cells, they were plated into 24-well dishes (∼50,000 cells/well) or 6-well dishes (one million cells/well) coated with poly-l-ornithine (Sigma, P4957) in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, l% N2 and 2% B27 supplements (Invitrogen), and 1% nondialyzed fetal bovine serum. Seven days after initial plating, the medium was supplemented with camptothecin (10 μm). At appropriate times of culture, cells were fixed in methanol for 15 min and assessed for neuronal survival as described below. Alternatively, cells were collected and analyzed by Western blot analyses as described below. Western Blot Analyses—Cortical neurons or differentiated stem cell cultures were dissociated and cultured as described above. Cortical neurons were washed twice in PBS and harvested in SDS-loading buffer (12Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiated stem cells were washed twice in PBS, harvested in IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 units/ml aprotinin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and sonicated at 4 °C for 10 s. Samples containing 10 μg of protein were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (11Giovanni A. Keramaris E. Morris E.J. Hou S.T.

Blots were probed with anti-p53 1C12 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:2000), calpain-cleaved spectrin derived from a calpain-cleaved spectrin epitope as reported previously (33Roberts-Lewis J.M. Savage M.J. Marcy V.R. Pinsker L.R. Siman R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MDM2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000), or anti-β-actin (Sigma; 1:3000) primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad; 1:3000) as indicated. Immunohistochemistry—Neurons cultured as described above in 6-well dishes were untreated or treated with camptothecin with and without calpain inhibitor cotreatment. Neuronal cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer solution for 30 min at 4 °Cas described previously (10Keramaris E. Stefanis L. Maclaurin J. Harada N. Takaku K. Ishikawa T.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with anti-cytochrome c (BD Biosciences; 1:400) or anti-p53 1C12 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:2000) primary and CY-3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) secondary antibodies. To distinguish neuronal phenotypes from glia in differentiated stem cell cultures, we used anti-β-III tubulin primary (Berkeley Antibody; 1:500) and streptavidin Alexa Fluor (Molecular Probes 1:200) secondary antibodies. Finally, cultures were incubated with Hoechst 33258 (0.25 μg/ml) for 10 min. Cells were visualized under fluorescent microscopy. The percentage of neuronal survival in stem cell cultures was obtained by whole well counting of shrunken and condensed nuclei of β-III tubulin-positive cells. Similarly, in cortical cultures infected with adenovirus expressing calpastatin and/or GFP, the percentage of shrunken nuclei and the expression of p53 and cytochrome c of infected cells were assessed by randomly counting a total of 150 cells/well. Each data point is the mean ± S.E. from three cultures. Caspase Activity—Cortical neurons were harvested at the indicated times for caspase activity. Briefly, cells were washed twice in PBS and collected in caspase lysis buffer as described previously (15Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and briefly sonicated for 3 s. The extracts were then centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. The supernatants were collected and assayed for protein concentration by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (5 μg) were incubated with the caspase-3 substrate DEVD-AFC as described previously, and fluorescence was measured using a fluorometer (400 nm excitation, 505 nm emission), as described previously (38Stefanis L.

Activation of Calpains following DNA Damage—We first determined whether calpains are activated following DNA damage. Treatment of embryonic cortical neurons with the DNA topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, camptothecin, induces apoptotic death (6Morris E.J. Geller H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Park D.S. Morris E.J. Greene L.A. Geller H.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1256-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Park D.S.

Ishikawa T. Taketo M.M. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Slack R.S. Park D.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the commitment point of this death is ∼6 h after initiation of camptothecin exposure (12Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the death signals that mediate this commitment must occur prior to this time point. Therefore, we determined whether calpain activity occurred within this commitment window by analyzing for the presence of calpainmediated proteolysis utilizing an epitope-specific antibody directed against the calpain cleavage site of α-spectrin. Antibodies raised against this epitope of α spectrin have been shown previously to be specific for calpain-cleaved spectrin and not for the proteolytic products of caspases (33Roberts-Lewis J.M. Savage M.J. Marcy V.R. Pinsker L.R. Siman R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, calpain activity begins to increase ∼2 h after camptothecin exposure and was robustly activated at 8 h. Consistent with this observation, cotreatment of neuronal cultures with the calpain inhibitor MDL 28170 blocked the induction of the calpain-cleaved spectrin signal. Increased calpain activity was not due to an increase in cellular amounts of calpains, because levels of the calpain μ and m large subunits remained relatively constant throughout the 8-h course of camptothecin exposure as determined by Western blot analyses (data not shown). This early induction of calpain activity is consistent with its role as a proximal death signal that may mediate death commitment. Calpain Inhibition and DNA Damage-induced Death—We next determined the functional consequences of calpain activation following DNA damage-induced neuronal death. To examine this, we first utilized the pharmacological calpain inhibitors MDL 28170 (39Mehdi S. Angelastro M.R. Wiseman J.S. Bey P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and PD 150606 (40Wang K.K. Nath R. Posner A. Raser K.J. Buroker-Kilgore M. Hajimohammadreza I. Probert Jr., A.W. Marcoux F.W.

As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, both inhibitors blocked neuronal death with in vivo IC50 values of ∼50 and 25 μm, respectively, at 14 h following camptothecin exposure. However, assessment of protection at later points could not be performed due to toxicity of the agents (data not shown). Neurons protected with the calpain inhibitors have well defined, healthy somas, whereas those treated with camptothecin alone show phase bright apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2C). Although neuritic processes were present in both PD 150606- and MDL 28170-treated cultures, they were generally fewer in number relative to untreated cells. These observations are consistent with reports linking calpains to process outgrowth (41Grynspan F. Griffin W.B. Mohan P.S. Shea T.B. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the protection offered by these inhibitors is concordant with the involvement of calpains in neuronal death, there are possible alternative explanations for these effects. Importantly, these inhibitors are known to block other targets, which include cathepsins (40Wang K.K. Nath R. Posner A. Raser K.J. Buroker-Kilgore M. Hajimohammadreza I. Probert Jr., A.W. Marcoux F.W. Ye Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. Caner H. Collins J.L. Fergus A. Lee K.S. Lunney E.A. Hays S.J. Yuen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6687-6692Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and calcineurins (43Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These potentially confounding effects have made interpretation of pharmacological inhibitor experiments difficult. To overcome this, we explored two additional and more targeted ways of calpain inhibition. In the first strategy, we infected cortical cells with an adenovirus expressing calpastatin, the endogenous calpain inhibitor. Cortical neuronal cultures were infected at the time of plating with recombinant adenovirus expressing either GFP and calpastatin or GFP alone. After 24 h, the cultures were exposed to camptothecin for 14 h. As shown in Fig. 3, neurons overexpressing calpastatin had healthy somas, intact nuclei, and reduced death when compared with GFP-expressing controls similarly treated with camptothecin (∼90% survival with calpastatin versus 50% with GFP). To provide further evidence for the involvement of calpain in cell death, we explored whether calpain deficient neurons were also resistant to DNA damage-induced death. Previous reports have indicated that cells deficient in the small calpain subunit (Capn4) lack both calpain μ and m activity (17Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Because, Capn4-/- mice do not survive beyond embryonic days 10–12 (17Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), it is not possible to obtain fully differentiated cortical neurons. To circumvent this problem, we isolated neuronal stem cells from the forebrain region of Capn4+/+, Capn4+/-, and Capn4-/- embryonic day 10.5 embryos. Neuronal stem cells were then exposed to differentiation medium as described previously (37Tropepe V. Sibilia M. Ciruna B.G. Rossant J. Wagner E.F. van der Kooy D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), treated with camptothecin, and fixed. Neuronally differentiated cells were identified by staining with the neuronal marker β-III tubulin, and death was assessed by nuclear Hoechst staining. As shown in Fig. 4, there was significantly more survival in calpain-deficient cells when compared with litter mate controls. Taken together, these data show that calpain inhibition by multiple means inhibits neuronal loss and provide strong evidence for the importance of calpains in neuronal death evoked by DNA damage. Calpains Mediate p53 Induction—We next examined the pathways by which calpains may mediate DNA damage mediated neuronal death. We (11Giovanni A. Keramaris E. Morris E.J. Hou S.T. O'Hare M. Dyson N.J.

Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported previously that p53 deficiency blocks death following camptothecin treatment. As shown in Fig. 5, cellular levels of p53 protein were elevated by 2 h and increased up to 8 h after camptothecin treatment. Little or no p53 was detectable in control cultures. We next asked whether calpains might modulate p53 induction. Interestingly, there was a reduction and a significant delay in p53 induction in cultures cotreated with the MDL 28170 inhibitor (Fig. 5, A and C). No p53 was detected at 4 h, and only ∼50% of p53 levels was present at 8 h in comparison with neurons treated with camptothecin alone. Similar results were obtained with the PD 150606 inhibitor (Fig. 5B). To confirm these results and rule out the possibility that inhibition of p53 was due to nonspecific effects of the pharmacological calpain inhibitors, we also examined the effects of calpastatin expression on p53 induction evoked by camptothecin. Neuronal cultures were infected with GFP and calpastatin or GFP-only adenovirus. Following camptothecin exposure, neurons were fixed, and GFP-positive neurons assessed for p53 induction by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 6, 85% of GFP-expressing neurons were p53 positive. In contrast, only 6% of neurons expressing calpastatin were positive for p53. Consistent with these results, differentiated stem cell cultures from Capn4-/- embryos also showed less p53 induction when compared with litter mate controls in response to camptothecin exposure (data not shown). Taken together, the pharmacological and molecular evidence indicates that p53 induction is mediated through calpain activation. MDM2 has been implicated in the st"

Accordingly we considered the possibility that the mouse was a species-specific knockdown of the human pathologic phenotype of ischemiainduced lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Transgenic mice were generated expressing amounts of iPLA2β activity comparable to that present in human myocardium. Coronary artery occlusion in Langendorff perfused hearts from transgenic mice resulted in a 22-fold increase in fatty acids released into the venous eluent (29.4 nmol/ml in transgenic versus 1.35 nmol/ml of eluent in wild-type mice), a 4-fold increase in lysophosphatidylcholine mass in ischemic zones (4.9 nmol/mg in transgenic versus 1.1 nmol/mg of protein in wild-type mice), and malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias within minutes of ischemia. Neither normally perfused transgenic nor ischemic wild-type hearts demonstrated these alterations. Pretreatment of Langendorff perfused transgenic hearts with the iPLA2 mechanism-based inhibitor (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (BEL) just minutes prior to induction of ischemia completely ablated fatty acid release and lysolipid accumulation and rescued transgenic hearts from malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Collectively these results demonstrate that ischemia activates iPLA2β in intact myocardium and that iPLA2β-mediated hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids can induce lethal malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias during acute cardiac ischemia. Electrophysiologic dysfunction is the major cause of death during myocardial infarction in humans (1Braunwald E. Zipes D.P. Libby P. Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, PA2001Google Scholar). Years ago we suggested that activation of myocardial phospholipases during acute cardiac ischemia resulted in the generation of amphiphilic metabolites that alter ion channel function, thereby precipitating lethal ventricular dysrhythmias (2Gross R.W.

Since myocytic electrophysiologic function is influenced by the physiochemical properties of the lipids surrounding ion channels (11Kim D. Clapham DE. Science. 1989; 244: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12Ordway R.W. Walsh Jr., J.V. Singer J.J.

However, a cause and effect relationship between ischemia-induced phospholipolysis and malignant ventricular arrhythmias has not previously been established. Moreover, myocardium contains at least three distinct intracellular phospholipase A2 (PLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; iPLA2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2; BEL, (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one; ESI/MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; PVC, premature ventricular contraction; VT, ventricular tachyarrhythmias; LAD, left anterior descending; TGiPLA2β, transgenic iPLA2β; αMHC, α myosin heavy chain; ANOVA, analysis of variance; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; WT, wild-type. 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; iPLA2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2; BEL, (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one; ESI/MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; PVC, premature ventricular contraction; VT, ventricular tachyarrhythmias; LAD, left anterior descending; TGiPLA2β, transgenic iPLA2β; αMHC, α myosin heavy chain; ANOVA, analysis of variance; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; WT, wild-type. activities encoded by discrete genes (iPLA2β, iPLA2γ, and cPLA2γ) (14Tang J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the molecular identity of the phospholipase A2 activated during cardiac ischemia is unknown. Finally, although each of these enzymes has been cloned, expressed, purified from recombinant systems, and subjected to detailed in vitro kinetic analyses, definitive proof of the ability of any of these discrete covalent entities (in the cPLA2 or iPLA2 families) to hydrolyze phospholipids in intact organs has not been directly demonstrated. Calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity was initially discovered in the cytosolic and membrane fractions of canine myocardium and identified as a novel phospholipase A2 activity by its ability to hydrolyze fatty acids from the sn-2 position of vinyl ether or diacyl phospholipids in the presence of EGTA (5Wolf R.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7295-7303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies unambiguously demonstrated that this activity was a bona fide phospholipase A2 since release of the sn-2 acyl chain from ether lipids could not result from sequential phospholipase A1 followed by lysophospholipase activities. Purification of canine myocardial cytosolic iPLA2 resulted in the isolation of a high specific activity 40-kDa polypeptide (6Hazen S.L Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whose identity was substantiated by its robust radiolabeling with the mechanism-based inhibitor (E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-[4-3H]naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (17Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise purification of iPLA2 from human myocardium also identified a high specific activity 40-kDa isoform (as in canine myocardium) and a larger 85-kDa polypeptide of lower specific activity (18Hazen S.L. Hall C.R. Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has demonstrated that the 40-kDa polypeptide was a proteolytic fragment of a larger gene that has now been cloned and had its 85-kDa protein product expressed and purified to homogeneity by tandem affinity chromatography (14Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 19Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Multiple groups have now observed the presence of the 40-kDa proteolytically processed form of iPLA2β in recombinant and naturally occurring subcellular fractions from different cell types (e.g. see Refs. 20Larsson Forsell P.K.A. Kennedy B.P. Claesson H.-E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Liu S.J. McHowat J. Am. J.

In continuing studies from our laboratory, we have demonstrated that iPLA2β activity is modulated by ATP (9Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 486-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and calcium-activated calmodulin (23Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20989-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover iPLA2β is activated by internal calcium pool depletion mediated by thapsigargin or other sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors (24Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Since alterations in energy metabolism and calcium ion homeostasis have both been implicated as important mediators of ischemic dysfunction, we hypothesized that iPLA2β was the enzymic mediator of accelerated lipid metabolism, altered membrane molecular dynamics, increased lipid second messenger generation, and electrophysiologic dysfunction in ischemic zones. Detailed studies have identified the ATP binding site (residues 431–450) and the calmodulin binding site (residues 690–752) in iPLA2β (25Jenkins C.M. Wolf M.J. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7129-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently we cloned and expressed a related peptide possessing both the ATP and lipase consensus sequence sites termed iPLA2γ (GenBank™ accession number AF263613) that contains a peroxisomal localization site and is not modulated by calmodulin (16Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Murine cardiac ischemia is accompanied by increases in anaerobic glycolysis, lactate production, alterations in high energy phosphate metabolism, dysfunctional calcium ion homeostasis, and contractile dysfunction, each of which are virtually indistinguishable from those manifest in human and other animal models of cardiac ischemia (26Radda G.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Das D.K. Dillmann W. Ho Y-S Lin K.M. Gloss B.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 346-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These changes in mouse, as in human cardiac ischemia, are each reversible if reperfusion occurs within 15 min of the ischemic episode (28Tian R. Abel E.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2961-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 29Headrick J.P. Peart J. Hack B. Flood A. Matherne G.P. Exp. Physiol. 2001; 86: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After 25–30 min of ischemia, these biochemical alterations become irreversible, leading to myocytic cellular necrosis, cell death, and permanent hemodynamic compromise. This constellation of findings is present in virtually every animal model of cardiac ischemia studied including humans (30Verdouw P.D. van den Doel M.A. de Zeeuw S. Duncker D.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 39: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Curtis M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 39: 194-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Lerner D.L. Yamada K.A. Schuessler R.B. Saffitz J.E. Circulation. 2000; 101: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, murine myocardial ischemia differs from ischemia in humans (and other animal models) by virtue of the fact that ventricular arrhythmias are uncommon in ischemic mouse hearts during the first 15 min of ischemia (i.e. prior to cellular necrotic changes) (33London B. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2001; 12: 1089-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Wit A.L. Janse M.J. Circulation. 1992; 85: I32-I41PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its relative ease of genetic manipulation, the mouse has become the prototypic model for validation of hypotheses implicating specific proteins in whole organ pathophysiologic processes. During the course of our studies, we demonstrated that murine myocardium possesses extremely low levels of iPLA2β activity, and others have reported that malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias are infrequent during murine acute cardiac ischemia (33London B. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2001; 12: 1089-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Wit A.L. Janse M.J. Circulation. 1992; 85: I32-I41PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the diminutive amounts of cardiac phospholipase A2 activity in murine myocardium and the paucity of ischemiainduced malignant tachyarrhythmias in the mouse were serendipitous findings or represented a natural species-specific knockdown of an important human pathophysiologic phenotype, we expressed iPLA2β in transgenic mice in a cardiac myocyte-specific manner by exploiting the selectivity of the α myosin heavy chain (αMHC) promoter. We utilized Langendorff perfused heart preparations of wild-type and transgenic mice to facilitate the detailed and coordinated analyses of alterations in iPLA2β-mediated phospholipolysis and ventricular arrhythmias after the induction of cardiac ischemia. We now report that myocardial ischemia activates iPLA2β in intact myocardium, that iPLA2β activation is sufficient to induce malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and that both the lethal lipid and electrophysiologic ischemic phenotypes can be concomitantly rescued by mechanism-based inhibition of iPLA2β enzymic activity.

Generation of Transgenic Mice Overexpressing iPLA2β in a Cardiac Myocyte-specific Manner—Cardiac myocyte-specific expression of iPLA2β in transgenic mice was accomplished by cloning the full-length 2.4-kb coding region of the wild-type Chinese hamster iPLA2β (from iPLA2β-pFAST (19Wolf M.J.

Glick J. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Transgenic founders were generated by microinjection of a NotI-linearized fragment containing the αMHC promoter-iPLA2β DNA sequence directly into the pronuclei of mouse (B6CBAF1/J) zygotes, resulting in integration of the transgene into the mouse germ line. Two founders, identified by PCR analysis of mouse tail DNA, were mated with C57Bl/J6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) to establish transgenic lines. Second and third generation heterozygous mice, typically 3–4 months of age, were used for all studies. Homogenization and Western Blot Analysis of Control and Transgenic Mouse Hearts—For preparation of cytosolic and membrane fractions, samples of tissue were homogenized in 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EGTA and 0.25 m sucrose using a Polytron tissue homogenizer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate crude membrane and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions. The membrane fraction was resuspended in a volume of homogenization buffer equal to the cytosolic fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (25Jenkins C.M.

Recombinant iPLA2β prepared as described previously was used as a standard (19Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Extraction and Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry of Lipids from Wild-type and Transgenic Mouse Myocardium—Lipids were extracted from mouse myocardium (∼50 mg) by a modified Bligh and Dyer technique. Mass spectrometry (ESI/MS) analyses were performed using a Finnigan TSQ-7000 spectrometer as described previously (37Han X. Gross R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For analyses of choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids as well as free fatty acids, LiOH in methanol (50 nmol/mg of protein) was added to the diluted tissue extracts. Membrane choline glycerophospholipids (including lysophosphatidylcholines) and sphingomyelins were directly quantitated as their lithium adducts by reference to internal standard (i.e. lithiated 14:1-14:1 glycerophosphocholine) after correction for 13C isotope effects in the positive ion mode (37Han X.

In a similar manner, ethanolamine glycerophospholipids were directly quantitated in the negative ion mode from membrane extracts rendered mildly basic with LiOH. For analyses of plasmalogen molecular species, lipid extracts were treated with acidic vapors prior to mass spectrometric analyses for differentiation of alkenyl-acyl from alkyl-acyl phospholipid molecular species. Similarly free fatty acids in lipid extracts rendered mildly basic by LiOH were directly quantitated in comparison to an internal standard (i.e. arachidic (C20:0) acid) after correction for 13C isotope effects in the negative ion mode. For anionic phospholipid analysis, diluted chloroform extracts of membrane samples were analyzed in the negative ion mode, and quantitation was made by comparisons to internal standard (i.e. 14:1-14:1 glycerophosphocholine) ion peak intensity. For analyses of individual molecular species, assignment of each ion peak was substantiated by tandem mass spectroscopic analyses in the molecular ion, neutral loss, or product ion scanning modes. Quantification of ion peaks corresponding to multiple individual isobaric molecular ions was substantiated using product ion ESI/MS/MS analyses (37Han X. Gross R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Electrophysiologic Studies with Isolated Langendorff Perfused Mouse Hearts—Ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by acute ischemia were characterized using an isolated Langendorff perfused heart preparation as described previously by Lerner et al. (32Lerner D.L. Yamada K.A. Schuessler R.B. Saffitz J.E. Circulation. 2000; 101: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Frequencies of spontaneous arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and episodes of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT)) were counted for 30 min after coronary ligation and tabulated as PVC frequency per 5-min intervals. A run of ventricular tachycardia was defined as 10 or more beats with a cycle length <100 ms. After 30 min, hearts were perfused through the aortic catheter with 1% Evans blue dye to delineate the ischemic zone for subsequent tissue analyses. To determine the effects of BEL on induction of arrhythmias after ischemia, hearts were perfused with buffer containing 10 μm BEL beginning 5 min before coronary artery ligation and during the ischemic interval. All studies were randomized and blinded. Assay of Calcium-independent Phospholipase A2 Activity—Calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity was measured by quantitating the release of radiolabeled fatty acid from l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine in the presence of cytosolic or membrane fractions as described previously (19Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—One-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the frequencies of spontaneous PVCs in wild-type control and transgenic iPLA2β (TGiPLA2β) hearts over consecutive 5-min intervals during 30 min of ischemia with or without BEL pretreatment as indicated. Individual comparisons between wild-type control and TGiPLA2β groups at each time interval studied were made with a twotailed Student's t test. The total number of episodes of VT in wild-type and TGiPLA2β transgenic hearts during 30 min of ischemia in the presence or absence of BEL pretreatment were compared by ANOVA. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Transgenic mice expressing iPLA2β in a cardiac myocyte-specific fashion were generated by exploiting the specificity inherent in the αMHC promoter. Tissue samples from the major organs of wild-type and TGiPLA2β mice revealed the presence of an intense band corresponding to iPLA2β at the expected molecular mass (85 kDa) in transgenic hearts that was not visible in wild-type heart tissue (Fig. 1A). No expression was detected in brain or liver, while a faint band corresponding to iPLA2β was detected in the kidneys of transgenic mice. Both cytosolic and crude membrane fractions from myocardium of TGiPLA2β mice displayed robust iPLA2β catalytic activity, while cardiac iPLA2β activity was diminutive in wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that the amount of iPLA2β activity present in transgenic mice is comparable to that naturally present in rabbit (2Gross R.W. Sobel B.E. Trans. Assoc. Am.

No differences in cardiac function were detected by echocardiographic analysis of 4-month-old animals nor were there any differences in the body weights of littermates, heart weights, or gross appearance of hearts present. Electron microscopic examination of TGiPLA2β hearts demonstrated normal cellular architecture except for the occasional areas in some cells of highly organized electron dense crystalline arrays that are currently being purified and will be reported on in due course. Phospholipid molecular species analysis by ESI/MS demonstrated modest but statistically significant decreases in some species of choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids (Fig. 2, A and B). However, despite the large increase in iPLA2β activity in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice, no substantial differences in the relative amounts of each molecular species were present. Thus, there was a modest decrease in phospholipids without any remodeling present (i.e. iPLA2β does not facilitate membrane remodeling). No significant alterations in cardiac anionic phospholipids or in sphingomyelin mass and molecular species content between WT and TGiPLA2β hearts were present.Fig. 2Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy of phospholipids in wild-type and transgenic myocardium.

In each case, other molecular species representing <2% of the total pools were also identified without demonstrable differences between control and transgenic mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether myocardial ischemia activates iPLA2β, resulting in iPLA2β-catalyzed hydrolysis of lipids in intact myocardium, a Langendorff perfused heart preparation was used. Samples of normally perfused and ischemic tissue from control and TGiPLA2β hearts were analyzed for fatty acid and lysolipid mass by ESI/MS. Similarly the release of fatty acids into the effluent during control and ischemic conditions was quantified. This strategy provides clear data on the amount of PLA2 activity manifest in the ischemic milieu in intact myocardium and avoids potential artifacts resulting from intrapreparative alterations in the enzyme (covalent or conformational) or the loss of effects of critical regulators of iPLA2 activity (e.g. ATP and calmodulin) during the homogenization process. After 15 min of coronary occlusion, release of fatty acids into effluents from TGiPLA2β perfused hearts increased 22-fold compared with WT controls. Similarly a 4-fold increase in fatty acid and lysophosphatidylcholine accumulation in the ischemic zone of hearts was present in TGiPLA2β mice but not in WT mice (Fig. 3). Moreover the release of fatty acids into the venous eluent and the accumulation of lysolipids and fatty acids in ischemic zones of hearts from transgenic mice were nearly completely ablated by pretreatment of Langendorff perfused hearts with the iPLA2β mechanism-based inhibitor BEL (Fig. 3). We specifically point out that murine ischemia in wild-type hearts was remarkable for the near absence of fatty acid release into the eluent and the absence of lysophosphatidylcholine and fatty acid accumulation in ischemic zones, which contrasts dramatically with every other model of cardiac ischemia previously studied (including humans). To determine the role of iPLA2β in arrhythmogenesis during acute cardiac ischemia, hearts from WT and TGiPLA2β mice were examined for PVCs and malignant ventricular arrhythmias after coronary ischemia in a Langendorff perfused heart preparation (32Lerner D.L. Yamada K.A. Schuessler R.B. Saffitz J.E. Circulation. 2000; 101: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Virtually no PVCs were observed in hearts from TGiPLA2β mice under normal flow conditions. However, ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in hearts from TGiPLA2β mice resulted in an increased frequency of PVCs and couplets within"
https://openalex.org/W2044304997,"Close homolog of L1 (CHL1) is a member of the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules expressed by subpopulations of neurons and glia in the central and peripheral nervous system. It promotes neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival in vitro. This study describes a novel function for CHL1 in potentiating integrin-dependent cell migration toward extracellular matrix proteins. Expression of CHL1 in HEK293 cells stimulated their haptotactic migration toward collagen I, fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin substrates in Transwell assays. CHL1-potentiated cell migration to collagen I was dependent on α1β1 and α2β1 integrins, as shown with function blocking antibodies. Potentiated migration relied on the early integrin signaling intermediates c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Enhancement of migration was disrupted by mutation of a potential integrin interaction motif Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala (DGEA) in the sixth immunoglobulin domain of CHL1, suggesting that CHL1 functionally interacts with β1 integrins through this domain. CHL1 was shown to associate with β1 integrins on the cell surface by antibody-induced co-capping. Through a cytoplasmic domain sequence containing a conserved tyrosine residue (Phe-Ile-Gly-Ala-Tyr), CHL1 recruited the actin cytoskeletal adapter protein ankyrin to the plasma membrane, and this sequence was necessary for promoting integrin-dependent migration to extracellular matrix proteins. These results support a role for CHL1 in integrin-dependent cell migration that may be physiologically important in regulating cell migration in nerve regeneration and cortical development.

In vertebrates, the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) 1The abbreviations used are: CAM, cell adhesion molecule; CHL1, close homolog of L1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MEK, MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBSS, Hanks' balanced saline solution; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. is comprised of four members: L1/NgCAM, close homolog of L1 (CHL1), neurofascin, and NrCAM, all serving multiple functions in the development and function of the nervous system. L1, the prototype of this family of transmembrane glycoproteins, has been shown to participate in cell migration, axon fasciculation, and guidance, as well as synaptogenesis and adult synaptic plasticity (1Schmid R.S. Maness P.F. Kalverboer A.F. Gramsbergen A. Handbook on Brain and Behaviour in Human Development. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Groningen, The Netherlands2001: 199-218Google Scholar). The importance of L1 function in human brain development is revealed by the association of mutations in the L1 gene with a syndromic form of mental retardation, the L1 syndrome, formerly named CRASH (corpus callosum agenesis, mental retardation, adducted thumbs, spasticity, and hydrocephalus) (2Rosenthal A. Jouet M. Kenwrick S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 107-112Google Scholar, 3Fransen E. VanCamp G. Vits L. Willems P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1625-1632Google Scholar, 4Kenwrick S. Watkins A. Angelis E.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 879-886Google Scholar). L1 knockout mice display nervous system anomalies similar to those seen in human patients, although there appear to be additional genetic modifiers of the disease (5Dahme M. Bartsch U. Martini R. Anliker B. Schachner M. Mantei N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 346-349Google Scholar, 6Cohen N.R. Taylor J.S.H. Scott L.B. Guillery R.W. Soriano P. Furley A.J.W. Curr.

Brain Res. 2001; 126: 21-30Google Scholar). L1 family members share a structural plan consisting of an extracellular region comprised of six Ig-like domains, four or five fibronectin type III domains, a single transmembrane segment, and a short, conserved cytoplasmic region (9Brummendorf T. Lemmon V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 611-618Google Scholar). The extracellular portion of these proteins is highly glycosylated and allows them to participate in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions with a variety of ligands, including other members of the Ig superfamily. The cytoplasmic domain of L1 family members interacts with components of the actin cytoskeleton (10Dickson T.C. Mintz C.D. Benson D.L. Salton S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1105-1112Google Scholar), protein kinases (11Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18217-18223Google Scholar, 12Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Google Scholar, 13Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 1-8Google Scholar), and complexes associated with endocytosis and protein trafficking in a lipid raft-associated manner (14Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Google Scholar, 15Nakai Y. Kamiguchi H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1097-1108Google Scholar). An important binding partner is ankyrin, a protein that binds to the subcortical actin/spectrin cytoskeleton (16Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27163-27166Google Scholar, 17Bennett V. Chen L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 61-67Google Scholar). The interaction of L1 with ankyrin occurs through a conserved FIGQY sequence (Phe-Ile-Gly-Gln-Tyr) within the cytoplasmic domain and is proposed to stabilize axonal membranes and/or intercellular connections (18Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the finding that in mice lacking ankyrin B, the axons eventually degenerate (19Scotland P. Zhou D. Benveniste H. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1305-1315Google Scholar), although initial axon outgrowth and L1 targeting are relatively normal. CHL1 is a newly identified member of the L1 family that is expressed in subpopulations of developing neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems and that persists at low levels in the mature brain in areas of high plasticity (20Hillenbrand R. Molthagen M. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 813-826Google Scholar, 21Liu Q. Dwyer N.D. O'Leary D.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7682-7690Google Scholar). CHL1 is also expressed by Schwann cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursors (22Holm J. Hillenbrand R. Steuber V. Bartsch U. Moos M. Lubbert H. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1613-1629Google Scholar) and is strikingly up-regulated in Schwann cells and sensory neurons upon nerve crush injury (23Zhang Y. Roslan R. Lang D. Schachner M. Lieberman A.R. Anderson P.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 71-86Google Scholar). The CALL gene, the human ortholog of the CHL1 gene (24Wei M.H. Karavanova I. Ivanov S.V. Popescu N.C. Keck C.L. Pack S. Eisen J.A. Lerman M.I. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 355-364Google Scholar), is closely linked to the 3p– syndrome characterized by mental retardation (25Angeloni D. Lindor N.M. Pack S. Latif F. Wei M.H. Lerman M.I. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 86: 482-485Google Scholar). The human CHL1 gene is mutated in a patient with mental retardation (26Frints S.G.M. Marynen P. Fryns J.P. Schachner M. Rolf B. D'Hooge R. De Deyn P.P. Hartmann D. Froyen G. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). An increased risk for schizophrenia associated with a missense polymorphism has also been reported (27Sakurai K. Migita O. Toru M. Arinami T. Mol. Psychiatry. 2002; 7: 412-415Google Scholar). A recent study (28Montag-Sallaz M. Schachner M. Montag D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7967-7981Google Scholar) showed that CHL1-deficient mice display misguided axons within the hippocampus and olfactory tract and anomalies in behavior. These findings emphasize the importance of CHL1 in the nervous system, although its specific functions are yet unknown. CHL1 shares the basic structural plan of L1 family members (22Holm J. Hillenbrand R. Steuber V. Bartsch U. Moos M. Lubbert H. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1613-1629Google Scholar) and has strong neurite outgrowth promoting capacity (20Hillenbrand R. Molthagen M. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 813-826Google Scholar). The sequence of CHL1 reveals ∼60% amino acid identity with L1 in the extracellular region and ∼40% identity in the cytoplasmic domain. Yet in contrast to L1, CHL1 is not capable of self-associating, nor does it bind heterophilically to L1, and an extracellular domain-binding partner remains to be found (20Hillenbrand R. Molthagen M. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 813-826Google Scholar). The extracellular segment of CHL1 contains a potential integrin-binding motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) in the second Ig-like domain, where it may be masked by the predicted horseshoe conformation of the molecule (29Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Google Scholar, 30Kunz B. Lierheimer R. Rader C. Spirig M. Ziegler U. Sonderegger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4551-4557Google Scholar), rather than within the sixth Ig-like domain as in L1. However, the sixth Ig domain of CHL1 contains another potential integrin interaction motif Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala (DGEA), which has been reported to mediate integrin-collagen interactions in platelets (31Staatz W.D. Fok K.F. Zutter M.M. Adams S.P. Rodriguez B.A. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7363-7367Google Scholar). Finally, CHL1 is the only L1 family member with an altered sequence (FIGAY) in the presumed ankyrin-binding domain, and it lacks the RSLE motif, which is characteristic of other family members and is involved in endocytosis. The structural resemblance and the differences between CHL1 and the other members of the L1 family of CAMs suggest that this molecule might have both similar and distinctive functions within cells. Recently it was shown that L1 promotes integrin-mediated haptotactic migration of cultured cells toward extracellular matrix proteins (32Ruppert M. Aigner S. Hubbe M. Yagita H. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1881-1891Google Scholar, 33Ebeling O. Duczmal A. Aigner S. Geiger C. Schollhammer S. Kemshead J.T. Moller P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Altevogt P. Eur. J.

Because of potential integrin interaction motifs in CHL1, it was speculated that CHL1 may have a role in integrin-mediated cell migration. Here it is shown that CHL1 promotes haptotactic cell migration toward extracellular matrix proteins, but this function differs from L1 in regard to preference of extracellular matrix substrate and integrin partners. These differences are related to the structural differences between CHL1 and L1 and may be important for differentially regulating cell migration during nerve regeneration and neuronal migration during development. Plasmids and Reagents—The following cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA): wild type mouse CHL1, a CHL1 mutant in which the RGD sequence in the Ig2 domain was mutated to KGE, a CHL1 mutant in which the DGEA sequence in the Ig6 domain was mutated to AGEV, a CHL1 mutant in which the cytoplasmic sequence FIGAY was mutated to FIGAA, and human wild type L1 (+RSLE) (from J. Hemperly, BD Technologies, Research Triangle Park, NC). A plasmid encoding ankyrin G fused to green fluorescent protein (ankyrin-GFP) was provided by Vann Bennett (Duke University, Durham, NC). A rabbit polyclonal antibody was made against mouse CHL1-Fc (22Holm J. Hillenbrand R. Steuber V. Bartsch U. Moos M. Lubbert H. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1613-1629Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody Neuro4 against an extracellular epitope of human L1 was a gift of J. Hemperly. The following antibodies were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA): anti-human β1 integrin monoclonal antibody 2253Z (clone 6s6), an activating monoclonal antibody MAB2000 (clone HB1.1) against human β1 integrin, anti-human α1 integrin monoclonal antibody 1973Z (clone FB12), and anti-human α2 integrin monoclonal antibody 1950Z (clone P1E6). Nonimmune mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Human vitronectin, human fibronectin, and murine laminin were from Invitrogen and Peninsula Laboratories (San Carlos, CA). BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA) provided type I collagen from rat tail. MEK inhibitor U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI), Src inhibitor PP2 and inactive analog PP3, and PI 3-kinase inhibitor Ly294002 (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA) were dissolved in Me2SO. Cell Culture and Haptotactic Migration Assay—HEK293 cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Mediatech Cellgro), 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 250 μg/ml kanamycin. Cultures at 80–90% confluence in 60-mm dishes were transfected for transient expression of CHL1 or L1 pcDNA3 plasmids (5 μg) using Lipofect-AMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). After 18–24hat 37 °C, the transfected cells were used for haptotactic migration or ankyrin recruitment assays. Haptotactic migration of HEK293 cells transiently expressing CHL1 or L1 was assayed essentially as previously reported (37Thelen K. Kedar V. Panicker A.K. Schmid R.S. Midkiff B.R. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4918-4931Google Scholar), using modified Boyden chambers with 8-μm pore filters (Transwells 3422, Corning/Costar, Acton, MA) in serum-free medium (DMEM, 0.4 mm MnCl2, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 250 μg/ml kanamycin). In the absence of Mn2+, CHL1 potentiated haptotactic migration of HEK293 cells toward collagen I (1.9-fold) to nearly the same extent as in the presence of Mn2+ (2.3-fold). The bottom sides of the filters were precoated with extracellular matrix proteins (500 μl of 20 μg/ml) or 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 4 °C overnight and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were detached with 5 mm Na-EDTA in Hanks' balanced saline solution (HBSS) and plated at 20,000 cells/Transwell. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated in serum-free medium with anti-integrin antibodies (1–4 μg/ml) for 15–30 min at 4 °C prior to plating. The cells were allowed to migrate for 3– 8hat37 °CinaCO2 incubator. After migration cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in PBS, and then treated with blocking solution (10% goat serum, 0.2% fish skin gelatin, PBS) for either 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. To score migration, cells from the upper or lower sides of filters were removed, and cells on the opposite side were stained by indirect immunofluorescence with purified CHL1 polyclonal antibodies (20 μg/ml) or L1 monoclonal antibody Neuro4 (5 μg/ml) in blocking solution for 4 h at room temperature, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:75 to 1:100 in blocking solution. The cells were counterstained with 10 μm bis-benzimide (Hoechst 33258; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The filters were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) on glass slides, and the cells were scored on both top and bottom surfaces of filters under epifluorescence illumination. For each filter, at least 150 cells were scored from six or more randomly selected fields using a 20× objective. To obtain the total number of cells on each side of a filter, the mean number of cells/field was determined and multiplied by a factor based on the number and size of fields and a filter diameter of 6.5 mm. The percentage of CHL1-immunoreactive cells that transmigrated was calculated as the ratio of CHL1-positive cells on the bottom of filters to total (top and bottom) CHL1-positive cells. The percentage of CHL1-negative bis-benzimide-positive cells that transmigrated was determined similarly. The percentage of cells transmigrated was converted to the total number of cells migrated per Transwell by multiplying the percentage by the number of cells plated. The experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and the results of each condition were averaged. The means and standard errors were determined for each condition. Significant differences between experimental groups was evaluated by Student's t test (p < 0.05, one-tailed). Transfection efficiency of HEK293 cells was determined as the number of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cells (transfected) divided by the number of bis-benzimide-labeled cells (transfected plus nontransfected) and was 50–70%. There was no deleterious effect of integrin antibodies or inhibitors on cell adhesion, which was evaluated by counting the total number of cells recovered after each assay. Similarly, inhibitors used at concentrations indicated in the signaling experiments (PP2, PP3, Ly294002, and U0126) did not affect the viability or cell recovery. Co-capping Experiments—HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3-CHL1 plasmid were dissociated in 5 mm EDTA in HBSS, washed with 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM, and resuspended in DMEM. The cells (30,000 cells/100 μl) were incubated with anti-integrin β1 mouse monoclonal antibody MAB2000 (20 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS, resuspended in DMEM containing 5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG (Fcγ fragment-specific), and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing in ice-cold HBSS, the cells were resuspended in 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM, plated onto collagen-coated MatTek plates (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA), and incubated for1hat37 °C to allow integrins to cluster. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed, and blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. To label CHL1, the cells were incubated with CHL1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (20 μg/ml in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. Finally, the cells were rinsed, mounted in Vectashield, and examined using an Olympus FV500 laser confocal microscope at the Microscopy Service Laboratory (Dr. Robert Bagnell, Department of Pathology, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill) using appropriate filter sets. Assay for Ankyrin Recruitment—Ankyrin recruitment to CHL1 in the plasma membrane was assayed essentially as previously described for L1 (38Needham L.K. Thelen K. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1490-1500Google Scholar) with the following modifications. HEK293 cells on poly-d-lysine-coated MatTek dishes were transfected with plasmid pEGFP-N1 expressing a fusion protein between ankyrin G and green fluorescent protein (ankyrin-GFP) (0.05 μg) with or without co-transfection of pcDNA3-CHL1 (0.1 μg) using LipofectAMINE 2000. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 15 min, washed, and incubated with blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum in PBS) for 30 min. To label CHL1 on the cell surface, the cells were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal antibody against CHL1 (20 μg/ml in blocking buffer), then washed, and incubated for 2 h with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. The cells were washed and mounted in Vectashield. GFP/immunofluorescence images were recorded on an Olympus FV500 laser confocal microscope. The ankyrin-GFP fluorescence was recorded using the 488-nm excitation line of the laser, whereas the TRITC-labeled CHL1 was examined using the 543-nm excitation line of the laser and the appropriate band pass filters. Each experiment was repeated four times. CHL1 Potentiates Haptotactic Cell Migration to Extracellular Matrix Proteins through β1Integrins—Extracellular matrix proteins are important in mediating cell migration and neuronal process growth in the developing nervous system (39Sobeih M.M. Corfas G. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 349-357Google Scholar) and are implicated in nerve response to injury (40Frostick S.P. Yin Q. Kemp G.J. Microsurgery. 1998; 18: 397-405Google Scholar, 41Previtali S.C. Feltri M.L. Archelos J.J. Quattrini A. Wrabetz L. Hartung H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 35-49Google Scholar). The ability of CHL1 to promote haptotactic migration toward extracellular matrix proteins was studied in Transwell assays in which cells were allowed to migrate from top to bottom chambers through filters coated on the underside with purified matrix molecules (37Thelen K. Kedar V. Panicker A.K. Schmid R.S. Midkiff B.R. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4918-4931Google Scholar). The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was used for these studies, because it expresses defined integrin subunits including α1, α2, α3, α5, αv, and β1, which can serve as extracellular matrix protein receptors (42Bodary S.C. McLean J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5938-5941Google Scholar, 43Simon K.O. Nutt E.M. Abraham D.G. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29380-29389Google Scholar), and because it does not express detectable levels of cell adhesion molecules of the L1 family (38Needham L.K. Thelen K. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1490-1500Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected for transient expression with pcDNA3 plasmids encoding CHL1 or L1, and haptotactic migration was assayed toward purified matrix proteins. Nontransfected HEK293 cells displayed greater migration toward collagen type I, fibronectin, and laminin compared with random migration toward bovine serum albumin but did not migrate significantly toward vitronectin (Fig. 1). Expression of CHL1 significantly enhanced haptotactic migration toward each of these substrates as well as to vitronectin (Fig. 1). In contrast to CHL1, L1 was clearly not capable of enhancing HEK293 cell migration to collagen I, similar to previous findings in rat B35 neuroblastoma cells (37Thelen K. Kedar V. Panicker A.K. Schmid R.S. Midkiff B.R. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4918-4931Google Scholar), although L1 was as effective as CHL1 at potentiating cell migration to fibronectin (Fig. 1). These results showed that CHL1 can promote haptotactic cell migration toward a range of ECM substrates and suggested that CHL1 might functionally interact with integrins. To determine whether integrins were involved in CHL1-mediated migration, haptotactic migration of HEK293 cells toward collagen I was further evaluated in the presence of function-blocking integrin antibodies. Collagen I was chosen as a substrate, because collagen I, in addition to collagens III and IV, increases at the site of nerve injury and promotes Schwann cell migration (41Previtali S.C. Feltri M.L. Archelos J.J. Quattrini A. Wrabetz L. Hartung H. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 35-49Google Scholar), and CHL1 is up-regulated in Schwann cells during peripheral nerve regeneration (20Hillenbrand R. Molthagen M. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 813-826Google Scholar, 23Zhang Y. Roslan R. Lang D. Schachner M. Lieberman A.R. Anderson P.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 71-86Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with function-blocking β1 integrin antibodies (44Ni H. Wilkins J.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 257-271Google Scholar) strongly inhibited CHL1-mediated HEK293 cell migration toward collagen I, as well as CHL1-independent migration of HEK293 cells (Fig. 2). Residual migration of CHL1-HEK293 cells in the presence of anti-β1 integrin antibodies was low but significantly elevated over that of HEK293 cells (p < 0.05), suggesting that CHL1 might function to a small extent through a non-β1 containing collagen receptor. Because the principal collagen I receptors are known to be α1β1 and α2β1 integrins (45van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Google Scholar), function-blocking antibodies against α1 and α2 integrins were evaluated next for effects on migration. Antibodies against either α1 or α2 integrin strongly inhibited CHL1-mediated migration toward collagen I, whereas α1 and α2 integrin antibodies added together were as effective as β1 integrin antibodies (Fig. 2). The α1 and α2 integrin antibodies were not as effective as β1 integrin antibodies in inhibiting the basal migration of HEK293 cells, thus it is likely that these cells use α1β1 and α2β1 integrins in addition to an unidentified β1 integrin heterodimer for migration to collagen. In summary, these results indicated that CHL1 potentiated the migration of HEK293 cells toward collagen I primarily through α1β1 and α2β1 integrins. The DGEA Motif in the CHL1 Ig6 Domain Is Required for Potentiating Migration to Collagen I—The mouse CHL1 and human CALL proteins contain a conserved Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala (DGEA) motif in the Ig6 domain of their extracellular regions (22Holm J. Hillenbrand R. Steuber V. Bartsch U. Moos M. Lubbert H. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1613-1629Google Scholar, 24Wei M.H. Karavanova I. Ivanov S.V. Popescu N.C. Keck C.L. Pack S. Eisen J.A. Lerman M.I. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 355-364Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DGEA motif is also present in collagen I where it serves as a recognition site for α2β1 integrin in platelets (31Staatz W.D. Fok K.F. Zutter M.M. Adams S.P. Rodriguez B.A. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7363-7367Google Scholar). Mutation of the DGEA sequence in the CHL1 Ig6 domain to Ala-Gly-Glu-Val (AGEV) effectively inhibited CHL1-potentiated migration of HEK293 cells toward collagen I, reducing migration to nearly the level of CHL1-nonexpressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 3). In the Ig6 domain of L1, an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence is required for potentiating migration to fibronectin (37Thelen K. Kedar V. Panicker A.K. Schmid R.S. Midkiff B.R. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4918-4931Google Scholar). The Ig2 domain of CHL1 contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif (22Holm J. Hillenbrand R. Steuber V. Bartsch U. Moos M. Lubbert H. Montag D. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1613-1629Google Scholar), and a corresponding sequence (Lys-Gly-Asp) in the human CALL protein is closely conserved though nonidentical (24Wei M.H. Karavanova I. Ivanov S.V. Popescu N.C. Keck C.L. Pack S. Eisen J.A. Lerman M.I. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 355-364Google Scholar). This motif might interact with integrins, because RGD is a known adhesion motif that is present in collagen I, fibronectin, and vitronectin, and it is recognized by at least eight integrins (46Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Google Scholar). However, mutation of the RGD in the CHL1 Ig2 domain to Lys-Gly-Glu (KGE) did not perturb CHL1-potentiated migration to collagen (Fig. 3). These results illustrated the importance of the DGEA sequence in the CHL1 Ig6 domain in mediating haptotactic migration toward collagen I through α1/α2 β1 integrins. CHL1 Enhances Migration through c-Src, PI 3-Kinase, and MAP Kinase—The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src, PI 3-kinase, and MAP kinase are key signaling intermediates down-stream of cell adhesion molecules such as L1 (47Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 283-323Google Scholar, 48Schmid R.S. Pruitt W.M. Maness P.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 11: 4177-4188Google Scholar). There is evidence that PI 3-kinase also has a role in integrin receptor recycling (49Ng T. Shima D. Squire A. Bastiaens P.I. Gschmeissner S. Humphries M.J. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3909-3923Google Scholar), whereas MAP kinase has well characterized functions in regulating cell migration through regulating new protein synthesis that may be required for synthesis of receptors (50Kolch W. Biochem. J."
https://openalex.org/W1984590580,"We previously studied the early trafficking of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells defective in Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) using cyclodextrin (CD) to monitor the arrival of cholesterol from the cell interior to the plasma membrane (PM) (Cruz, J. C., Sugii, S., Yu, C., and Chang, T.-Y. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4013–4021). We found that newly hydrolyzed cholesterol derived from LDL first appears in certain CD-accessible pool(s), which we assumed to be the PM, before accumulating in the late endosome/lysosome, where NPC1 resides. To determine the identity of the early CD-accessible pool(s), in this study, we performed additional experiments, including the use of revised CD incubation protocols. We found that prolonged incubation with CD (>30 min) caused cholesterol in internal membrane compartment(s) to redistribute to the PM, where it became accessible to CD. In contrast, a short incubation with CD (5–10 min) did not cause such an effect. We also show that one of the early compartments contains acid lipase (AL), the enzyme required for liberating cholesterol from cholesteryl ester in LDL. Biochemical and microscopic evidence indicates that most of the AL is present in endocytic compartment(s) distinct from the late endosome/lysosome. Our results suggest that cholesterol is liberated from LDL cholesteryl ester in the hydrolytic compartment containing AL and then moves to the NPC1-containing late endosome/lysosome before reaching the PM or the endoplasmic reticulum. We previously studied the early trafficking of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells defective in Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) using cyclodextrin (CD) to monitor the arrival of cholesterol from the cell interior to the plasma membrane (PM) (Cruz, J. C., Sugii, S., Yu, C., and Chang, T.-Y. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4013–4021). We found that newly hydrolyzed cholesterol derived from LDL first appears in certain CD-accessible pool(s), which we assumed to be the PM, before accumulating in the late endosome/lysosome, where NPC1 resides.

After endocytosis, LDL enters the endosomal/lysosomal system, where cholesteryl ester, a major lipid found in LDL, is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acid lipase (AL) (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4350) Google Scholar). Mutations in AL cause cholesteryl ester to eventually accumulate in the lysosome (2Brown M.S. Sobhani M.K. Brunschede G.Y. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3277-3286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Anderson R.A. Byrum R.S. Coates P.M. Sando G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After the hydrolytic action by AL, the transport of LDL-derived cholesterol from the endosome/lysosome to the plasma membrane (PM) or to the endoplasmic reticulum for re-esterification requires the protein named Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1). Mutations in NPC1 cause unesterified cholesterol and other lipids to accumulate in the late endosome and lysosome. Despite significant advances, the events that led to eventual accumulation of cholesterol in the late endosome/lysosome remain unclear. To delineate the early trafficking events of LDL-derived cholesterol, we previously performed pulse-chase experiments using [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL ([3H]CL-LDL) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cells defective in the npc1 locus, CT43, along with their parental cells, 25RA (4Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To monitor the arrival of [3H]cholesterol at the PM, we utilized a cyclodextrin (CD)-based intact cell assay. CD is a water-soluble molecule that has a high affinity for cholesterol and has been widely used to monitor the arrival of cholesterol at the PM from the cell interior (5Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46414-46421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results show that [3H]cholesterol, newly released from the hydrolysis of [3H]CL-LDL, emerges in the early pool(s) in a manner unaffected by the npc1 mutation. Subsequently (within 2 h), in the parental cells, [3H]cholesterol is distributed to the PM and the endoplasmic reticulum. In CT43 cells, [3H]cholesterol accumulates in the characteristic aberrant endosome/lysosome. [3H]Cholesterol that is present in the early pool(s) is extractable by CD, whereas [3H]cholesterol that accumulates in the aberrant endosome/lysosome is resistant to extraction by CD. Based on this CD sensitivity test, the early pool(s) was assumed to be the PM (4Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These results led us to hypothesize that, in NPC1 cells, cholesterol liberated from cholesteryl ester in LDL first moves to the PM independent of NPC1 and then moves back to the cell interior and accumulates in the aberrant late endosome/lysosome. Using a similar CD-based assay, other investigators independently reached the same conclusion (7Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The original CD-based assay used by us and by others involved continuous incubation of cells with CD for 30 min or longer. Thus, it is possible that prolonged incubation of cells with CD may cause redistribution of cellular cholesterol, so cholesterol originally residing in internal membranes moves to the PM and becomes extractable by CD. Recently, Haynes et al. (9Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4508-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed that, in CHO cells, depending on the incubation time used (ranging from 30 s to 20 min), CD is capable of extracting cellular cholesterol from two or three kinetically distinct pools; rearrangement of cholesterol between these pools could occur under various treatments. In this work, we further investigated the early trafficking events of LDL-derived cholesterol. To follow the fate of newly hydrolyzed cholesterol more precisely, we redesigned the procedures for the pulse-chase experiment and the CD treatment. We also performed biochemical and immunofluorescence experiments to define the hydrolytic compartment(s) involved in producing LDL-derived cholesterol. A model, revised from the one previously proposed by this laboratory (4Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), describing the early itinerary of LDL-derived cholesterol in the context of the endocytic pathway is presented.

CHO cells were maintained in medium A (Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml gentamycin) as monolayers at 37 °C with 5% CO2. When medium B (Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% delipidated FBS plus 35 μm oleic acid and 10 μg/ml gentamycin) was used at lower temperatures (18 °C or lower), Ham's F-12 medium (titrated to pH 7.4 without sodium bicarbonate) was used, and cells were placed in a water bath without CO2. A human fibroblast (Hf) cell line derived from an NPC patient (No. 93.22) was the generous gift of Dr. Peter Pentchev (National Institutes of Health). Hf cell lines isolated from patients with Wolman's disease (GM00863A and GM01606A) and with mucolipidosis II (I-cell disease) (GM02013D) were from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Hepatocyte-like HepG2 and monocytic THP-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Prior to each experiment, the cells were cultured for 2 days in medium B (to deplete stored cholesterol within the cell). Cells were chilled on ice, labeled with 30 μg/ml [3H]CL-LDL in medium B for 5 h at 18 °C, and washed once with 1% bovine serum albumin-containing cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C and three more times with cold PBS. Cells were then fed cold medium B and placed in a water bath for the indicated chase times at 37 °C. During the chase period, rapid metabolism of [3H]CL-LDL occurs in a time-dependent manner. To obtain reproducible results, we found that it was essential to use healthy cells grown at late log phase for plating and to control the temperature and pH of the growth media in a precise manner. To control the temperature, we incubated tissue culture plates or dishes on platforms covered with water in a constant temperature water bath. To control the pH in a precise manner, we used media devoid of sodium bicarbonate and titrated to pH 7.4 within 1 week before usage. An acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitor (2 μm F12511) was included whenever cells were incubated at 37 °C. F12511 was previously shown to inhibit acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase activity at the submicromolar level (21Chang C.C. Sakashita N. Ornvold K. Lee O. Chang E.T. Dong R. Lin S. Lee C.Y. Strom S.C. Kashyap R. Fung J.J. Farese Jr., R.V. Patoiseau J.F. Delhon A. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28083-28092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Labeled cellular lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC as described (17Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.-Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); the percent hydrolysis was calculated as [3H]cholesterol counts divided by the sum of [3H]CL and [3H]cholesterol counts. For cholesterol efflux experiments, cells were incubated with 4% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) in medium B in the presence of the acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitor at 37 °C for the indicated times. The labeled lipids were extracted and analyzed as described (4Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol.

The percent cholesterol efflux was calculated as [3H]cholesterol counts in the medium divided by the sum of [3H]CL counts in the cell and [3H]cholesterol counts in the cell and in the medium. Isolation of the PM—To isolate the PM from the cells, we employed the 30% Percoll gradient procedure essentially as described (20Cruz J.C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Briefly, after the pulse-chase experiment, cells in two 150-mm dishes were collected. The cells were scraped in buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.8) and broken with 15 strokes using a stainless steel tissue grinder (Dura-Grind, Wheaton). The post-nuclear supernatant was loaded onto a 30% Percoll gradient. After centrifugation at 84,000 × g for 30 min, 25 fractions were collected from the top. The PM fractions usually corresponded to fractions 9 and 10, as evidenced by a visible white membrane band; this band showed high enrichment in Na+/K+-ATPase and caveolin-1 protein (20Cruz J.C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, we performed biotinylation of PM proteins in intact cells at 4 °C for 10 min using sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce), which showed that only fractions 9 and 10 were highly enriched in the biotinylated proteins (data not shown). The 3H-labeled lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol and analyzed by TLC as previously described (20Cruz J.C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 11% Percoll Gradient Analyses—All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The fractionation method was performed as described previously (4Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Spillane D.M. Reagan Jr., J.W. Kennedy N.J. Schneider D.L. Chang T.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the pulse-chase experiment, cells from one 150-mm dish were scraped into homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4)) and homogenized with 15 strokes using the same stainless steel tissue grinder described above. To minimize breakage of membrane vesicles, 250 mm sucrose was included in the buffer. To increase recovery, the pellet was resuspended in buffer and homogenized a second time. The combined post-nuclear supernatant from cells was loaded onto 11% Percoll and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 40 min using a Beckman Model Ti-70.1 rotor. 10 fractions were collected from the top. >80% of the PM marker (Na+/K+-ATPase) was concentrated in fractions 1 and 2, whereas >80% of the late endosomal/lysosomal markers (LAMP1/LAMP2) were concentrated in fractions 9 and 10 as previously described (4Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The 3H-labeled lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol and analyzed by TLC as previously described (20Cruz J.C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Optiprep Gradient Analyses—The procedure was based on a previously described method (23Sheff D.R. Daro E.A. Hull M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells grown in one 150-mm dish were homogenized at 4 °C as described above. The post-nuclear supernatant (1 ml) was placed onto 9 ml of a linear 5–20% Optiprep gradient prepared in homogenization buffer at 4 °C. Gradients were centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SW 41 rotor. 20 fractions (0.5 ml each) were carefully collected from the top. Immunoblot analyses were performed using antibodies against individual organelle markers as indicated. The 3H-labeled lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol and analyzed by TLC as previously described (20Cruz J.C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Immunoblot and Spectrofluorometric Analyses of Percoll Fractions— For immunoblot analysis, each Percoll fraction was ultracentrifuged either at 100,000 × g for 90 min or at 150,000 × g for 30 min to remove the Percoll particles. Afterward, the samples (located on top of the Percoll particles) were carefully collected using Pasteur pipettes. Proteins present in these fractions were concentrated by chloroform/methanol precipitation (24Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were dissolved in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture), separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-AL antibodies (1:1000). To quantitate the LysoTracker signal (a late endosomal/lysosomal marker), we used a highly sensitive fluorometer to measure the fluorescence intensities present in various Percoll fractions. The method is briefly described as follows. Cells were incubated with 100 nm LysoTracker Red for 2 h at 37 °C and then fractionated on a Percoll gradient at 4 °C. The Percoll fractions were ultracentrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min to remove the Percoll particles. Each fraction was then quantitated for its fluorescence at Ex577 nm/Em590 nm using a PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer from ISS Inc. (Champaign, IL). For detection of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in GFP-transfected or NPC1-GFP-transfected cells, a modified method was needed (because Percoll particles exhibited autofluorescent signals that strongly interfered with the GFP signal). Each Percoll fraction was solubilized with the non-fluorescent detergent Thesit (Roche Applied Science) at 0.2%, and the solubilized material was ultracentrifuged at 150,000 × g for 6 h. The fluorescent signal present in the supernatant was quantitated in the fluorometer at Ex488 nm/Em507 nm. Construction and Transfection of GFP-tagged NPC1—The construct encoding mouse NPC1 protein fused with GFP was created and sub-cloned into the pREX-IRES vector by a procedure described elsewhere (25Sugii, S., Reid, P. C., Ohgami, N., Shimada, Y., Maue, R. A., Ninomiya, H., Ohno-Iwashita, Y., and Chang, T.-Y. (2003) J. Lipid Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). CT43 cells were transfected with the npc1-gfp cDNA using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control experiments showed that expression of NPC1-GFP, but not GFP alone, completely rescued the cholesterol accumulation defect in CT43 cells, indicating that the NPC1-GFP fusion protein is functional (25Sugii, S., Reid, P. C., Ohgami, N., Shimada, Y., Maue, R. A., Ninomiya, H., Ohno-Iwashita, Y., and Chang, T.-Y. (2003) J. Lipid Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). Transfected cells were used within 2–3 days of transfection for imaging analysis and within 4 days for Percoll gradient analysis. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates or in 60-mm dishes and processed for fluorescence studies. For LysoTracker labeling, cells were preincubated with 200 nm LysoTracker Red in the medium at 37 °C for 2 h prior to the experiment. For DAMP staining, intact cells were incubated with 50 μm DAMP for 30 min at 37 °C (26Anderson R.G. Falck J.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 27Anderson R.G. Pathak R.K. Cell. 1985; 40: 635-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); its signal was detected with monoclonal antibody against DNP, followed by Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibody. For immunostaining, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times again, and permeabilized either with methanol (chilled at -20 °C) for 1 min or with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. After three more washes, the cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with predetermined concentrations of various primary antibodies in the blocking medium for 1 h. When anti-V-ATPase antibody was used as the primary antibody, the incubation time was for 20 min only. Antibody dilutions used in immunofluorescence were as follows: LAMP2 (1:200), AL (1:500 to 1:1000), EEA1 (1:50), syntaxin-6 (1:50), caveolin-1 (1:100), V-ATPase (1:1000), CI-MPR (1:500), and DNP (1:100). For double labeling studies using rabbit anti-AL and rabbit anti-CI-MPR antibodies, Zenon rabbit IgG labeling kits (Alexa 488 and Alexa 568, respectively) were employed according to the manufacturer's protocol. For other labeling studies, cells were washed with PBS three times, treated with various Alexa-conjugated secondary IgGs, and then washed three times. The coverslips were mounted with a drop of ProLong antifade medium onto the glass slides before image processing. Samples were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a ×63 objective equipped with a CCD camera (DEI-750, Optronics Engineering, Goleta, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine filters were used to visualize GFP/Alexa 488 and LysoTracker Red/Alexa 568, respectively. The images were processed using MetaView Version 4.5 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downing-town, PA). In selective experiments as indicated, the samples were also viewed under a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 krypton/argon laser scanning confocal microscope. The images were constructed using LaserSharp software and further processed using Adobe Photoshop Version 5.02. Early Trafficking of LDL-derived Cholesterol Probed with a Long Versus Short Incubation with CD—We grew CT43 and 25RA cells in cholesterol-free medium for 2 days and pulse-labeled them with [3H]CL-LDL for 5 h at 18 °C. At this temperature, LDL was internalized, but accumulated in pre-lysosomal compartments without significant hydrolysis of CL. When the temperature was increased to 37 °C, CL in LDL was rapidly hydrolyzed to free cholesterol and transported to designated locations (4Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In numerous experiments, we found that the half-time of hydrolysis averaged 25 ± 5 min in both cell types; a typical result is shown in Fig. 1F. During the warm-up period (i.e. immediately after the labeling), if cells were continuously incubated with CD for various time periods as indicated (0–120 min), 25RA and CT43 cells showed the same degree of cholesterol efflux toward CD; the efflux significantly increased from 30 min on (Fig. 1A). When cells were chased at 37 °C for 30 min before adding CD for up to 120 min, a slight defect in cholesterol efflux (starting at 15 min after adding CD) occurred in CT43 cells (Fig. 1B). In a separate experiment, a slight efflux defect in CT43 cells was also found in cells chased for 15 min before CD treatment (data not shown). In contrast, a severe efflux defect in CT43 cells occurred when cells were chased at 37 °C for 60 min (Fig. 1C) or for 120 min (Fig. 1D) before adding CD. In a separate experiment, a severe efflux defect in CT43 cells was also shown in cells chased for 45 min before CD treatment (data not shown). We next compared cholesterol effluxes in 25RA and CT43 cells using a procedure that involves a short incubation with CD (28Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J.

Myeloid-related proteins MRP8 and MRP14 of the S100 family are EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. MRP8 and MRP14 were co-isolated from neutrophils on an anti-p47phox matrix with oxidase cytosolic factors and identified by mass spectrometry. MRP8 and MRP14 are absent from Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B lymphocytes, and, coincidentally, these cells display weak oxidase activity compared with neutrophils. MRP8/MRP14 that was purified from neutrophils enhanced oxidase turnover of B cells in vitro, suggesting that MRP8/MRP14 is involved in the activation process. This was confirmed ex vivo by co-transfection of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes with genes encoding MRP8 and MRP14. In a semi-recombinant cell-free assay, recombinant MRP8/MRP14 increased the affinity of p67phox for cytochrome b 558 synergistically with p47phox. Moreover, MRP8/MRP14 initiated oxidase activation on its own, through a calcium-dependent specific interaction with cytochrome b 558 as shown by atomic force microscopy and a structure-function relationship investigation. The data suggest that the change of conformation in cytochrome b 558, which initiates the electron transfer, can be mediated by effectors other than oxidase cytosolic factors p67phox and p47phox.

Moreover, MRP8/MRP14 dimer behaves as a positive mediator of phagocyte NADPH oxidase regulation. The phagocyte respiratory burst depends on the NADPH reduction of molecular oxygen and generation of superoxide anion O2·¯ upon activation of the cell with soluble (chemotactic factors) or particulate (bacteria or fungi) stimuli (1Morel F. Doussière J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 523-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The O2·¯ -generating NADPH oxidase (EC 1.6.99.6) is a heterogeneous complex compartmentalized in resting cells, between plasma membrane, cytosol, and the cytoskeleton, which assembles at the plasma membrane level once activated. Cytochrome b 558 is the membrane redox core of the oxidase complex, which, after activation, transfers electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen. It is constituted of gp91phox (the β-catalytic subunit) and p22phox (α-subunit), which is necessary in phagocytes to stabilize the 1/1 (α/β) heterodimer (2DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B. Yu L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Three soluble factors, p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox, participate in the activation process, as does the monomeric G protein Rac1/2. Another monomeric G protein, Rap1A, has been identified in the membrane and proposed as a possible regulation factor of the oxidase complex (3Maly F.-E. Quilliam L.A. Dorseuil O. Der C.J. Bokoch G.M.

In phagocytes, O2·¯ and derivatives are synthesized in large amounts and used as bactericidal tools, but uncontrolled production is also injurious to tissues and triggers inflammatory reactions (5Lambeth J.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 427-439Google Scholar, 6Vignais P.V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity is transitory; it is submitted to a strict up- and down-regulation process. Up to now, oxidase activation has been investigated, but the molecular support of down-regulation has not. In fact, the role of a membrane-associated GTPase-activating protein has been described and related to the deactivation of NADPH oxidase (7Geiszt M. Dagher M.C. Molnar G. Havasi A. Faure J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10710-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recent observations would support an allosteric regulation of NADPH oxidase activity where cytochrome b 558 is the catalytic subunit. In the oxidase assembly, p67phox is the limiting factor (9Freeman J.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22578-22582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 10Koshkin V. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The binding of p67phox to cytochrome b 558 mediates the transition from an inactive to an active conformation of cytochrome b 558 (11Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the process, p47phox and Rac1/2 are introduced as positive effectors, whereas the p40phox function remains undetermined.

Boulay F. Doussière J. Vignais P.V. Medecine/Sciences. 1992; 8: 912-920Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All the components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex are expressed in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B lymphocytes. However, in these cells, the activity of stimulated oxidase is 100 times inferior to that of human neutrophils (13Morel F. Cohen Tanugi Cholley L. Brandolin G. Dianoux A.C. Martel C. Champelovier P. Seigneurin J.M. François P. Bost M. Vignais P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both neutrophils and EBV-B cells are qualitatively similar in terms of the nature of their oxidase constituents, but they differ in the concentration and stoichiometry of the cytosolic factors compared with cytochrome b 558 (14Kobayashi S. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuribayashi F. Nunoi H. Nakamura M. Kanegasaki S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the weak oxidase activity measured in intact EBV-B lymphocytes was not only a result of the low expression of cytochrome b 558, but also of a possible defect or constraint in the assembly process because of an unfavorable membrane environment (15Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Burritt J.B. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In fact, once cytochrome b 558 is extracted from the membrane of both cell types, the turnover of reconstituted NADPH oxidase is similar. It is also possible that such a low activity may result from down-regulation because regulatory factors normally present in phagocytes are absent in the B cells. Myeloid-related proteins, MRP8 and MRP14, are two proteins of the S100 family (S100A8 and S100A9, respectively) expressed by myeloid cells and some secretory epithelium (16Itou H. Yao M. Fujita I. Watanabe N. Suzuki M. Nishihira J. Tanaka I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In myeloid cells, they represent ∼45% of the cytosolic proteins in neutrophils (17Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) and 1% in monocytes. MRP8 and MRP14 are not expressed by resident macrophages, although they may be present in macrophages of inflammatory lesions (18Xu K. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4916-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MRPs are known to be markers of inflammation. Their expression by infiltrating neutrophils was assumed to reflect activation stages (19Kerkhoff C. Klempt M. Kaever V. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32672-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In inflammation, high levels of MRP8 and MRP14 were found in the extracellular medium of stimulated neutrophils (20Morel F. Dewald B. Berthier S. Zaoui P. Dianoux A.C. Vignais P.V. Baggiolini M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and these proteins could be markers of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and ulcerative colitis (17Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 21Kumar R.K. Yang Z. Bilson S. Thliveris S. Cooke B.E. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 59-64PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the complex is released by dying cells or is a result of active secretion has not been clarified. The two proteins are deposited onto endothelium venules through a specific MRP14-heparan sulfate proteoglycan interaction (22Robinson M.J. Tessier P. Poulsom R. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3658-3665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that MRP8 and MRP14 participate in neutrophil migration, phagocytosis, and activation (21Kumar R.K. Yang Z. Bilson S. Thliveris S. Cooke B.E. Geczy C.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 59-64PubMed Google Scholar). However, their specific function remains unclear. MRP8 and MRP14 are believed to be present as a 1/1 non-covalent heterodimer, the process of dimer formation being calcium-dependent. Four MRP14 isoforms have been identified, although this is not the case for MRP8 (23Hessian P.A. Fisher L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that both proteins also associate with membrane and cytoskeleton in a calcium-dependent manner (24Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that MRP8 and MRP14 play a role in potentiating activation of O2·¯ -generating oxidase in bovine neutrophils (25Doussière J. Bouzidi F. Vignais P.V. Biochem. Biophys.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 3246-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) also reported that MRP8/MRP14 interacts preferentially with the cytosolic factor p67phox, which translocates to plasma membrane upon stimulation. Moreover, various phosphorylated states of MRPs may discriminate subcellular compartmentation (27Guignard F. Mauel J. Markert M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using a proteomics approach, we identified MRP8 and MRP14 associated with oxidase cytosolic factors in a complex isolated from neutrophil cytosol. In contrast, there was neither MRP8 nor MRP14 in the complex isolated from EBV-B cell cytosol. MRP8/MRP14 purified from human neutrophils and recombinant MRP8/MRP14 were shown to complement the cytosol of EBV-B cells and to restore a full oxidase activity, as measured in human neutrophils. These observations were confirmed ex vivo after MRP-encoding gene transfection. We demonstrated further that this effect was mediated through a specific interaction with cytochrome b 558 and a change of conformation that initiated oxidase activation. Materials—Chemical reagents used in this study were obtained from the following sources: Carbolink™ coupling gel (Pierce); l-α-phosphatidylcholine type II-S, PMA, carbenicillin, and Luminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione) (Sigma); ECL Western blotting detection reagents, and FPLC monoQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden); immobilized linear pH gradient strips, IPG buffer, pH 3–10 (Bio-Rad); synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal portion of p47phox (ADLILNRSSESTKRKLASAV) (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France), MRP8 (Calgranulin A C19), MRP14 (Calgranulin B C19), goat polyclonal antibody, and donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); PIA (Difco); Geneticin 10131– 019 (G418) (Invitrogen Corp., Paisley, United Kingdom); trypsin, sequencing grade (Promega, Charbonnières, France). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (anti-MRP8/MRP14) were from M. Markert (Central Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry, Lausanne, Switzerland). Mouse monoclonal antibodies 54.1 and 44.1 directed against gp91phox and p22phox, respectively, were prepared by J. B. Burritt and A. Jesaitis (Department of Microbiology, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT). The plasmids pRc-CMV-MRP8, pRc-CMV-MRP14, and pRc-CMV-GFP were kindly provided by H. Perron (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Human recombinant MRP8 and MRP14 (28Kerkhoff C. Vogl T. Nacken W. Sopalla C. Sorg C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Nacken W. Sopalla C. Propper C. Sorg C. Kerkhoff C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 560-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. C. Kerkhoff (Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of Münster, Münster, Germany). The cDNA encoding p47phox cloned into the plasmid pGEX-2T was kindly provided by A.W. Segal and F. Wientjes (Department of Medicine, University College London, London, United Kingdom) (30Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphoid Cell Lines and Neutrophils—Citrate-sterile venous blood was drawn from healthy patients after obtaining their informed consent. Neutrophils from buffy coats and B lymphocytes were isolated according to previously used methods (31Cohen Tanugi-Cholley L. Morel F. Pilloud-Dagher M.C. Seigneurin J.M. François P. Bost M. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Lymphocytes were immortalized with the B95-8 strain of Epstein-Barr virus. The EBV-B lymphocyte cell lines were kept in culture using RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cytosolic fractions from the 3 mm diisopropyl fluoro-phosphate-treated and purified neutrophils and EBV-B cells were prepared as described (32Batot G. Martel C. Capdeville N. Wientjes F. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Batot G. Paclet M.H. Doussière J. Vergnaud S. Martel C. Vignais P.V. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 188-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). EBV-B lymphocytes from a p47phox-deficient CGD patient were kindly provided by M.-A. Pocidalo (INSERM U479, Hôpital Bichat, Paris, France). Recombinant Proteins—Full-length cDNAs encoding p67phox, p47phox, and Rac1 were expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein using pGEX-3X (p67phox) or pGEX-2T (p47phox and Rac1). Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.2 mm at 20 °C for p67phox and p47phox, 0.1 mm at 37 °C for Rac1) for 3 h. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were affinity-purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacteria on glutathione-Sepharose (11Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After washing in PBS, recombinant proteins were cleaved directly on the matrix using Xa factor (p67phox)or thrombin (p47phox and Rac1) in PBS. Recombinant proteins (p67phox, p47phox, and Rac1) were stored at –20 °C or used in cell-free assay. Isolation of the p47phox, p67phox, p40phox Cytosolic Activation Complex—Anti-p47phox immunoglobulins were immobilized onto a Carbolink™ coupling matrix. Cytosol from either EBV-B lymphocytes or neutrophils was used to affinity-purify the p47phox-, p67phox-, and p40phox-activating factors as a complex (33Batot G. Paclet M.H. Doussière J. Vergnaud S. Martel C. Vignais P.V. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 188-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Vergnaud S. Paclet M.H. El Benna J. Pocidalo M.A. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cytosol (50 –100 mg, i.e. 2–5 × 109 cell eq) was preincubated first with an uncoupled Carbolink™ matrix and then with a Carbolink™ matrix coupled with nonspecific immunoglobulins. Unbound proteins were loaded on the anti-p47phox matrix previously equilibrated in PBS, with overnight recycling at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, bound proteins were eluted either with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, or with 1 m NaCl and then 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, or with 2 mm competitor peptide (used to generate the anti-p47phox antibodies). Glycine eluates were immediately buffered with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, dialyzed against PBS containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μm N3α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1.8 μm leupeptin, 1.5 μm pepstatin) and stored at –80 °C until further use. To verify the specificity of the recovered proteins, a control experiment was conducted with cytosol from p47phox-deficient EBV-B lymphocytes. MRP8 and MRP14 Purification—MRP8 and MRP14 were purified from the cytosol of unstimulated neutrophils as described (35Van den Bos C. Rammes A. Vogl T. Boynton R. Zaia J. Sorg C. Roth J. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophil cytosol was submitted to 70% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. The 10,000 × g centrifugation supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA, and fractionated through FPLC onto a monoQ anion exchange column. The bound MRP8 and MRP14 were eluted with 0.13 m NaCl, as shown on the elution chromatogram (Fig. 1A, left panel), and then dialyzed against PBS. The major elution peak was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, right panel, lane 1). This peak presented two peptide bands with an apparent molecular mass of 16 and 11 kDa, identified by Western blotting as MRP14 and MRP8, respectively (Fig. 1A, right panel, lane 2). This fraction was called MRP8/MRP14. The absence of contaminating p47phox, p67phox, and Rac in the purified fraction was checked by Western blot (Fig. 1B, lanes 1) versus a positive control performed on neutrophil cytosol (Fig. 1B, lanes 2). The purified proteins were stored at –80 °C until further use. Oxidase Activity Reconstitution in a Cell-free Assay with Purified Cytochrome b 558 —Cytochrome b 558 was purified from the plasma membranes of 1010 PMA-stimulated neutrophils and from 1010 EBV-B lymphocytes and relipidated with l-α-phosphatidylcholine II-S as reported (11Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was then quantified by reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra using an absorption coefficient of 106 mm–1·cm–1 (15Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Burritt J.B. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Oxidase activity was reconstituted by incubating purified cytochrome b 558 (0.215 pmol) with cytosol isolated from neutrophils or from EBV-B lymphocytes (300 μg) in the presence of 10 μm FAD, 40 μm GTPγS,5mm MgCl2 and an optimal amount of arachidonic acid (80 –100 nmol) in a final volume of 100 μl of PBS. In some experiments the effect of MRP8/MRP14 purified from neutrophil cytosol was investigated. MRP8/MRP14 (0.75–1.3 μg) was preincubated in the presence of 500 nm CaCl2 at room temperature for 20 min. Then, reconstitution was performed by adding first calcium-loaded MRPs, then purified cytochrome b 558, and finally cytosol. In the semi-recombinant system, the activity was reconstituted with purified cytochrome b 558 from neutrophils (0.215 pmol = 2.15 nm) and recombinant proteins: rRac1 (100 nm), rp67phox (0 –300 nm), rp47phox (185 nm), and a mixture (1/1) of rMRP8 and rMRP14 (300 nm) (rMRP8/rMRP14) preincubated for 20 min with 500 nm calcium as previously done. The oxidase activity was estimated by measuring the reduction of ferricytochrome c in the absence or the presence of superoxide dismutase at 550 nm (Σ550 nm = 21.1 mm–1·cm–1) and expressed as turnover, mol of O2·¯ ·s–1·mol of heme b –1 (15Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Burritt J.B. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). High Resolution Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The neutrophil cytosolic activating factors p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox, isolated as a complex on the Carbolink™ affinity matrix (75 μg), were submitted to high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as reported (36Garin J. Diez R. Kieffer S. Dermine J.F. Duclos S. Gagnon E. Sadoul R. Rondeau C. Desjardins M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Proteins (75 μg) were precipitated with 7% (v/v) perchloric acid, washed with cold acetone, and solubilized in 2% (v/v) IPG buffer 3–10 containing 8 m urea, 4% (p/v) chaps, 18 mm DTT, and traces of bromophenol blue. The strips were rehydrated with the 100,000 × g ultracentrifugation supernatant (1 h, 20 °C). Proteins were first separated according to their isoelectric point along linear pH gradient strips (pH 3–10). Electrophoresis was performed at 50 μA/strip at 20 °C. Then the strips were equilibrated, first in a solution containing 0.375 m Tris, 6 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 130 mm DTT at pH 8, and then in a similar buffer in which DTT was replaced by 135 mm iodoacetamide. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the proteins were separated according to their molecular mass using standard SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained as previously described (37Santoni V. Kieffer S. Desclaux D. Masson F. Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3329-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), or processed for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Trypsin Digestion—Protein bands of interest were excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained 11% SDS-PAGE (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and washed with 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, for 10 min and then with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, for 10 min at room temperature. This step was repeated three times, and finally the sample was washed in ultrapure water and completely vacuum dried. “In-gel” tryptic digestion was performed for 4 h at 37 °C in 10 –20 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, with 0.3– 0.5 μg of trypsin per sample, depending on the gel volume and protein amount. Peptide Mass Fingerprinting by Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra of the tryptic digest were acquired on a Biflex (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with gridless delayed extraction. The tryptic digests (0.5 μl) were deposited onto the target disk on a thin dry layer of matrix (mixture 4:3 (v/v) of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid in acetone, and a solution of nitrocellulose (10 mg of nitrocellulose in 1 ml of 50% (v/v) isopropanol and 50% (v/v) acetone). Samples had been washed with 5 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid before drying, as previously described by Garin (36Garin J. Diez R. Kieffer S. Dermine J.F. Duclos S. Gagnon E. Sadoul R. Rondeau C. Desjardins M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The MALDI spectra were analyzed by comparing a list of mass-to-charge ratios (peptide mass fingerprint) acquired for each digested protein to available data bases at prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0u/msfit.htm. Proteins were identified by MS/MS analysis when no consistent hit was found. Peptide Sequencing by Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS)—The tryptic digest was extracted with 5% formic acid and then with pure acetonitrile. The digest solution and extracts were vacuum dried, dissolved in 10 μl of 10% formic acid, and desalted with ZipTip™ (Millipore). After elution with 5–10 μl of 50% acetonitrile combined with 0.1% formic acid, the peptide solution was introduced into a glass capillary (MDS Protana) for nanoelectrospray ionization. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were carried out on a Q-TOF hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass) to obtain amino acid sequence information. MS/MS sequence information was used for data base searching using the MS-Pattern programs (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0u/mspattern.htm) or Peptide Search (www.narrador.embl-heidelberg.de/). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Experimentation—For AFM experiments, the medium contained cytochrome b 558 (0.2 pmol) purified from neutrophils or from EBV-B lymphocytes and incorporated into l-α-phosphatidylcholine liposomes, 40 μm GTPγS, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm FAD (11Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Aliquot fractions (10 μl) were collected from the mixture before and after incubation with 100 nmol of arachidonic acid at room temperature, deposited on a mica surface, and allowed to adhere for 1 min. After three washings with 200 μl of distilled water and overnight desiccation, samples were observed using AFM. In some experiments, the medium also contained purified MRP8/MRP14 (0.75 μg), preloaded or not with Ca2+ (as described for oxidase activity reconstitution) or cytosol (from neutrophils or EBV-B lymphocytes; 300 μg). The AFM measurements were carried out in air at room temperature using a ThermoMicroscopes Explorer AFM in the low amplitude true non-contact mode, as previously described (11Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Liposome height was determined on x images (where x represents the number of liposome images acquired for the same preparation, x > 3) of three different experiments using the ThermoMicroscopes SPMLab software after calculation of the distance between two selected points. Transfection of EBV-B Lymphocytes—Electroporation was used for transfection of pRc-CMV-MRP8, pRc-CMV-MRP14, and pRc-CMV-GFP in EBV-B lymphocytes. Briefly, EBV-B lymphocytes were harvested, washed three times, and suspended at 107 cells/300 μl in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine at room temperature. Cells were then mixed with 50 μg of plasmid DNA and electroporated once in a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette at 220 V for 10 ms (BTX ECM 830™, Electro Square Porator). Then they were immediately diluted in 6 ml of complete medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. FACS analysis of transfected cells (FACScalibur, Becton Dickinson) showed a 14% transfection efficiency 48 h after transfection. Selection of transfected cells began at 48 h after transfection by cultivating cells in the presence of Geneticin (G418) (500 μg/ml). Superoxide production of transfected cells was measured by chemiluminescence. Measurement of NADPH Oxidase Activity in EBV-B Lymphocytes Using Chemiluminescence—Lymphocytes (5 × 105 to 2 × 106) suspended in 50 μl of PBS were added to 200 μl of PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, 20 μm Luminol, and 10 units/ml horseradish peroxidase. Superoxide production was measured by chemiluminescence after adding 10 μl of a 2 μg/ml PMA solution (39De Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photon emission was recorded at 37 °C for 1 h with a Luminoscan (Labsystem, Pontoise, France). Polyclonal Antibodies against Cytosolic Factors—Polypeptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of p40phox (residues 325–339) and the C-terminal regions of p47phox (residues 371–390) and p67phox (residues 511–526) were synthesized by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Anti-sera were used for Ig purification onto a 1-ml protein A-Sepharose CL-4B matrix (34Vergnaud S. Paclet M.H. El Benna J. Pocidalo M.A. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The proteins were fractionated by 10 or 11% SDS-PAGE ("
https://openalex.org/W2054218213,"Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for many human cancers, and nitric oxide (NO) produced in inflamed tissues has been proposed to cause DNA damage via nitrosation or oxidation of base moieties. Thus, NO-induced DNA damage could be relevant to carcinogenesis associated with chronic inflammation. In this report, we report a novel genotoxic mechanism of NO that involves DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) induced by oxanine (Oxa), a major NO-induced guanine lesion. When a duplex DNA containing Oxa at the site-specific position was incubated with DNA-binding proteins such as histone, high mobility group (HMG) protein, and DNA glycosylases, DPCs were formed between Oxa and protein. The rate of DPC formation with DNA glycosylases was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that with histone and HMG protein. Analysis of the reactivity of individual amino acids to Oxa suggested that DPC formation occurred between Oxa and side chains of lysine or arginine in the protein. A HeLa cell extract also gave rise to two major DPCs when incubated with DNA-containing Oxa. These results reveal a dual aspect of Oxa as causal damage of DPC formation and as a suicide substrate of DNA repair enzymes, both of which could pose a threat to the genetic and structural integrity of DNA, hence potentially leading to carcinogenesis.

Marsden P.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 71-90Google Scholar). A high flux of NO is produced by macrophages expressing inducible NO synthase during inflammatory responses (3MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Google Scholar). Because chronic inflammation has been long recognized as a risk factor for many human cancers, it has been postulated that NO is carcinogenic by virtue of its ability to induce DNA damage (4Ohshima H. Bartsch H. Mutat. Res. 1994; 305: 253-264Google Scholar, 5Tamir S. Tannenbaum S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: 31-36Google Scholar, 6Wink D.A. Vodovotz Y. Laval J. Laval F. Dewhirst M.W.

Although NO itself is not reactive to DNA, this molecule is converted to reactive nitrogen oxide species such as peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and nitrous anhydride (N2O3). ONOO– is a powerful oxidizing agent formed by the reaction with the superoxide anion ( O2·¯) that is simultaneously excreted from macrophages. ONOO– primarily oxidizes guanine to 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) (8Kennedy L.J. Moore Jr., K. Caulfield J.L. Tannenbaum S.R. Dedon P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 386-392Google Scholar), further degradation products of 8oxoG (9Tretyakova N.Y. Niles J.C. Burney S. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 459-466Google Scholar), and 8-nitroguanine (10Yermilov V. Rubio J. Ohshima H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 207-210Google Scholar, 11Yermilov V. Rubio J. Becchi M. Friesen M.D. Pignatelli B. Ohshima H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2045-2050Google Scholar). 8oxoG is a potent mutagenic lesion inducing GC → TA transversions, whereas 8-nitroguanine readily undergoes depurination to yield an abasic site, a potent lethal as well as mutagenic lesion. N2O3 is a powerful nitrosating agent that is formed by autoxidation of NO in the presence of oxygen. Nitrosation of the primary amino group of guanine, adenine, and cytosine by N2O3 induces deamination, resulting in xanthine (Xan), hypoxanthine (Hx), and uracil (U), respectively (12Wink D.A. Kasprzak K.S. Maragos C.M. Elespuru R.K. Misra M. Dunams T.M. Cebula T.A. Koch W.H. Andrews A.W. Allen J.S. Keefer L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1001-1003Google Scholar, 13Caulfield J.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12689-12695Google Scholar). Nitrous acid (HNO2) also induces deamination of guanine, adenine, and cytosine by a similar mechanism (14Hartman Z. Henrikson E.N. Hartman P.E. Cebula T.A. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1994; 24: 168-175Google Scholar). We have previously identified a novel reaction product, oxanine (Oxa), that is formed by the nitrosation of guanine with NO or nitrous acid (15Suzuki T. Yamaoka R. Nishi M. Ide H. Makino K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2515-2516Google Scholar, 16Suzuki T. Ide H. Yamada M. Endo N. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Morii T. Makino K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 544-551Google Scholar). Oxa and Xan were formed at a molar ratio of 1:3 when 2′-deoxyguanosine or DNA was treated with NO or nitrous acid. Oxa is also formed by incubation with N-nitrosoindoles (17Lucas L.T. Gatehouse D. Shuker D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18319-18326Google Scholar, 18Lucas L.T. Gatehouse D. Jones G.D. Shuker D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 158-164Google Scholar), showing that N-nitroso compounds produced by nitrosation of secondary amines by NO or nitrous acid can mediate Oxa formation. Although Oxa can be mutagenic and cytotoxic by directly affecting DNA replication or the stability of duplex DNA (19Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8013-8019Google Scholar), there is another possibility: the O-acylisourea structure of Oxa is fairly reactive and can form an adduct or a DNA-protein cross-link (DPC) with nucleophilic cellular molecules (Fig. 1A). Indeed, we have recently shown in a model reaction that an Oxa-glycine adduct was formed when 2′-deoxyoxanosine and concentrated glycine were incubated in aqueous solution (21Suzuki T. Yamada M. Ide H. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Morii T. Makino K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 227-230Google Scholar). Similarly, a diazoate derivative of 2′-deoxycytidine, a reaction intermediate formed by NO or nitrous acid (22Suzuki T. Nakamura T. Yamada M. Ide H. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Morii T. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7151-7158Google Scholar), also reacts with lysine and its homopolymer to yield covalent adducts (23Suzuki T. Yamada M. Nakamura T. Ide H. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Morii T. Makino K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 1223-1227Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the results from several laboratories using repair-deficient Escherichia coli strains suggest that the principal DNA repair path-way for counteracting the mutagenic or cytotoxic effect of NO and nitrous acid is not base excision repair but nucleotide excision or recombination repair (14Hartman Z. Henrikson E.N. Hartman P.E. Cebula T.A. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1994; 24: 168-175Google Scholar, 24Routledge M.N. Mutat. Res. 2000; 450: 95-105Google Scholar, 25Tamir S. Burney S. Tannenbaum S.R.

Mutagenesis. 1997; 12: 23-28Google Scholar). Considering the bulky nature of DPCs and the covalent adducts potentially formed by Oxa and cytosine diazoate, it is likely that these lesions are processed by nucleotide excision or recombination repair in cells (29Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. AMS Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 30Petit C. Sancar A. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 15-25Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, it has been shown recently that UvrABC nuclease incises DPC containing a covalent T4 endonuclease adduct with a moderate efficiency (31Minko I.G. Zou Y. Lloyd R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1905-1909Google Scholar). Thus, DPCs and covalent adducts induced by NO or nitrous acid may exert mutagenic or cytotoxic effects in the absence of appropriate repair mechanisms (14Hartman Z. Henrikson E.N. Hartman P.E. Cebula T.A. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1994; 24: 168-175Google Scholar, 24Routledge M.N. Mutat. Res. 2000; 450: 95-105Google Scholar, 25Tamir S. Burney S. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res.

However, except for the model reactions described above (21Suzuki T. Yamada M. Ide H. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Morii T. Makino K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 227-230Google Scholar, 22Suzuki T. Nakamura T. Yamada M. Ide H. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Morii T. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7151-7158Google Scholar), no studies have been performed to clarify whether DPC or adducts are formed between Oxa or cytosine diazoate in DNA and cellular components. In the present study, we prepared a duplex oligonucleotide containing site-specific Oxa and examined the reactivity to proteins and polyamines. We report here that Oxa in DNA reacts with nuclear proteins such as histone, high mobility group (HMG) protein, and certain types of DNA repair enzymes (i.e. DNA glycosylases) as well as polyamines to form DPC. DPC formation is also observed in the incubation with the HeLa cell extract. The efficiencies of DPC formation with histone and DNA glycosylases differ dramatically, suggesting two distinct mechanisms of DPC formation. Chemicals and Enzymes—2′-Deoxyoxanosine 5′-triphosphate (dOTP) was synthesized and purified as reported previously (19Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides with normal constituents were synthesized by the standard phosphoramidite method. A 25-mer oligonucleotide (25X) containing 8oxoG was synthesized, 5′-labeled with 32P, and annealed to the complementary strand as reported previously (32Asagoshi K. Yamada T. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Monden Y. Arai T. Nishimura S. Aburatani H. Lindahl T. Ide H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4956-4964Google Scholar). The sequence of 25X was 5′-CATCGATAGCATCCTXCCTTCTCTC-3′ (X = 8oxoG), and the duplex was designated 25X/C. Calf thymus histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Branchburg, NJ), and calf thymus HMG protein (a mixture of HMG-1 and HMG-2) was obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) deficient in 3′-5′ exonuclease (Pol I Kf (exo–)) was obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). DNA glycosylases, including E. coli endonuclease (Endo) III (33Asagoshi K. Odawara H. Nakano H. Miyano T. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Seki S. Ide H.

Commun. 1999; 258: 605-610Google Scholar) were prepared as reported previously. Trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), proteinase K (Wako, Osaka, Japan), thrombin (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX), and exonuclease (Exo) I (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were obtained from the indicated companies. Preparation of an Oligonucleotide Containing Oxa—Oxa was site-specifically incorporated into an oligonucleotide by a DNA polymerase reaction using dOTP. A 15-mer primer (5′-CATCGATAGCATCCT-3′) was 5′-labeled with 32P and annealed to a 25-mer template (3′-GTAGCTATCGTAGGACGGAAGAGAG-5′; the underlined template position indicates where dOTP was incorporated). The template/primer (25 pmol, final concentration 62.5 nm) was incubated with dOTP (20 μm) and Pol I Kf (exo–) (50 units) in 66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 6.6 mm MgCl2 (total volume, 400 μl) at 25 °C for 5 min (first-stage reaction). Subsequently, dCTP and dTTP (final concentration, 20 μm) were added to the reaction mixture and incubation was further continued at 25 °C for 40 min (second-stage reaction). DNA was purified by phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, and gel filtration on a Sephadex G75 column (3 ml). Under these conditions, a single residue of Oxa was incorporated immediately after the original primer terminus (i.e. opposite the underlined “C” in the template). This was confirmed by PAGE analysis of the first-stage reaction product in a separate experiment. The resulting primer terminus containing Oxa was extended to a fully replicated product by incorporation of dCTP and dTTP. dOTP is not incorporated during the second-stage reaction, because Pol I Kf (exo–) inserts dOTP opposite template pyrimidines (C and T) but not purines (A and G) (19Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Google Scholar). The strand containing Oxa (5′-CATCGATAGCATCCTOCCTTCTCTC-3′, O = Oxa) and the duplex were designated 25O and 25O/C, respectively. 25G containing G in place of Oxa at the same position was annealed to the complementary strand, and the resulting undamaged duplex was designated 25G/C. Reactions of 25O/C with Proteins—25O/C (final concentration, 4 nm) was incubated with 4 μg of a histone component (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, or H4; final concentrations, 6–12 μm), a mixture of 4 μg each of all components (H1–H4; final concentrations, 6–12 μm), or 2 μg of HMG protein (final concentration, 2.7 μm) in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 30 μl) at 37 °C for up to 48 h. The sample was mixed with an equal volume of SDS-loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8% SDS, 24% glycerol, 0.02% SERVA BLUE G, and 4% 2-mercaptoethanol), heated, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Molecular weight markers were also electrophoresed side by side: phosphorylase (Mr = 97,400), albumin (66,267), aldolase (42,400), carbonic anhydrase (30,000), trypsin inhibitor (20,100), and lysozyme (14,400). The gel was briefly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The radioactivity of the gel was measured using a Fuji BAS2000 phosphorimaging analyzer. The reactions with DNA repair enzymes were performed in a similar manner. The enzymes used were DNA glycosylases from human (hNTH1 and hOGG1), mouse (mMPG), and E. coli (Endo III, Endo VIII, Fpg, and AlkA). 25O/C (final concentration, 4 nm) was incubated with 2 μg of a DNA glycosylase (final concentrations, 1.7–2.2 μm) in an appropriate buffer (30 μl) at 37 °C for up to 1 h. The composition of the incubation buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT for hNTH1 and hOGG1; 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm KCl for mMPG; 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA for Endo III, Endo VIII, and Fpg; and 70 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm mercaptoethanol for AlkA. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described for histone. When the reaction was performed with inactivated enzyme (or histone), proteins (hOGG1, AlkA, Endo VIII, and histone mixture) were heat-denatured at 80 °C for 10 min prior to incubation. The heat treatment of hOGG1, AlkA, and histone did not result in significant changes in protein concentrations as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis. However, the concentration of Endo VIII was decreased to one-third of that before heat treatment probably due to aggregation of the protein. Thus, the concentration of Endo VIII was increased (3-fold) in the reaction with inactivated Endo VIII (see also “Results” for Fpg). Protease and DNase Treatment of DPCs—25O/C and protein (histone H2B, Fpg, or Endo VIII) were incubated as described above. After incubation, an aliquot (2.5 μl) of the reaction mixture was further treated with trypsin, proteinase K, thrombin, DNase I, or Exo I in a buffer recommended by the suppliers (final volume, 10 μl) at 37 °C for 10 min to 1 h. Further details of the experiments are described in the figure. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Reactions with HeLa Cell Extracts—The nuclear cell extract was prepared from confluent HeLa cells. All procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. The harvested cells were suspended in 5 volumes of 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.5 mm DTT, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,800 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was suspended in 3 volumes of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT). The cells were disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes). The sample was centrifuged (3,300 × g for 15 min), and the supernatant was discarded. The precipitate containing cell nuclei was mixed with a half volume of low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and 25% glycerol) followed by a half volume of hypertonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and 25% glycerol) and kept standing for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed (Mr cut-off = 3,000) against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT for 5 h. The extract was stored as aliquots at –80 °C. The protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 25O/C (final concentration, 4 nm) was incubated with the cell extract (20 μg as protein) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0–100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA (total volume, 15 μl) at 37 °C for 1 h. The products were analyzed as described for histone. The reaction with the heat-treated cell extract (80 °C for 10 min) was performed in a similar manner. For the assays with anti-hOGG1 antibody-treated cell extracts, the cell extract (20 μg as protein) was incubated with serially diluted monoclonal anti-hOGG1 antibody (1, 1/10, or 1/100 dilution: 2.5 μl) at 4 °C for 30 min. The monoclonal antibody raised against a whole hOGG1 (isoform 1a) protein was a gift from Sankar Mitra, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX. The cell extract pretreated with the antibody was incubated with 25O/C as described above, and DPC was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In parallel experiments, the antibody-treated cell extract (8 μg as protein) was incubated with 25X/C (final concentration, 2 nm) containing 8oxoG in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT (total volume, 10 μl) at 37 °Cfor1h. The sample was mixed with 1 m NaOH (final concentration, 0.1 m), heated at 70 °C for 10 min to completely cleave abasic sites, and neutralized with 1 m acetic acid. Products were mixed with a formamide gel loading buffer (0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA, and 95% formamide), heated, and analyzed by 16% denaturing PAGE containing 8 m urea. The radioactivity of the gel was analyzed as described for SDS-PAGE. Reactions of 25O/C with Amino Acids and Amines—25O/C (final concentration, 2 nm) was incubated with an amino acid or an acetylated amino acid (final concentration, 1 mm) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA (total, 40 μl) at 37 °C for up to 48 h. After incubation, DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The sample was mixed with formamide gel loading buffer, heated, and separated by 16% denaturing PAGE. The radioactivity of the gel was analyzed as described above. The reactions with monoamines (propylamine and dipropylamine) and polyamines (spermidine, spermine, and putrescine) were performed in a similar manner. DPC Formation with Histone and HMG Protein—25O/C was incubated with individual histone components (molar ratio of 25O/C:histone = 1:1,000–3,000) for 12–36 h, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2A shows the SDS-PAGE data for the sample after 36 h of incubation. All histone components (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) reacted with 25O/C to form DPCs so that new bands other than free DNA were observed in autoradiogram (Fig. 2A, right panel). The gel mobility of DPCs was lower than that of the corresponding free proteins as well as free DNA (Fig. 2A). The apparent Mr values of free histones and their DPCs were determined from the gel mobility of free histones (CBB-stained bands) and that of DPCs (autoradiogram) (Fig. 3A). The differences in the Mr between free histone components and the corresponding DPCs were 7,900–11,000, which corresponded to the approximate size of single-stranded 25O (Mr = 8,100). Thus, DPC comprised a histone component and 25O/C at a ratio of 1:1 before denaturation of the complex. DPC was not formed when the reaction was performed with 25G/C containing G in place of Oxa at the same site (data not shown), indicating that the cross-link reaction was specific for Oxa. Because the preparations of histones H2B and H3 contained histones H4 and H1/H2A as contaminants, respectively (Fig. 2A, left panel, marked bands), DPCs due to the contaminants also appeared as additional bands in the autoradiogram (Fig. 2A, right panel, marked bands). The apparent rate constant of cross-link formation of Oxa (kapp) was calculated from the hourly yield of DPC ([Cross-link product]in Table I) and the concentration of histone ([Protein (amine)] in Table I) by applying second order reaction kinetics, where kapp = [Cross-link product]/([25O/C] × [Protein (amine)]). The variation in kapp for the histone components was at most 3-fold (lowest for H1 and highest for H4, Table I). 25O/C was also incubated with a mixture of all histone components under similar conditions. Each component formed DPC (Fig. 2B), but the total amount of DPC formed with the histone mixture was significantly lower (by about 5-fold) than the simple summation of DPC formed from individual reactions (e.g. compare Fig. 2A, right panel (all 36 h reactions), with Fig. 2B, right panel, at the 36-h reaction). Histones H2A and H2B form a stable dimer (H2A/H2B), and H3 and H4 form a stable tetramer [(H3/H4)2] in the absence of DNA (40Kornberg R.D. Thomas J.O. Science. 1974; 184: 865-868Google Scholar, 41Kornberg R.D. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). It is possible that the association between histone components might have masked reactive sites in the proteins or reduced the effective concentration of histones available for the reaction. HMG protein also reacted with 25O/C to form DPC (Fig. 2C). The reaction conditions of HMG protein were similar to those for histone (molar ratio of 25O/C:HMG = 1:675 and incubation time = 12–36 h). The DPC contained HMG protein and 25O/C at a ratio of 1:1 as judged from the increase in the apparent Mr (Fig. 3A). The value of kapp with HMG protein was comparable to those of histone components (Table I).Fig. 3Determination of apparent Mr values of free proteins and their DPCs.A, the indicated histone components or HMG protein were incubated with 25O/C, and products were separated by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 2. The gel mobilities of free proteins and their DPCs were determined from the CBB-stained bands and autoradiogram, respectively. The mobilities of free histones and DPCs are plotted on the Mr calibration curve obtained with Mr standards (phosphorylase (Mr = 97,400), albumin (66,267), aldolase (42,400), carbonic anhydrase (30,000), trypsin inhibitor (20,100), and lysozyme (14,400)).

https://openalex.org/W2049468323,"An increasing number of tyrosine kinases have been shown to associate with isoforms of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. Here, we show evidence for physical and functional interaction between PKCδ and the Src family kinase Fyn in human platelets activated by alboaggregin-A, a snake venom capable of activating both GPIb-V-IX and GPVI adhesion receptors. This interaction involves phosphorylation of PKCδ on tyrosine and is specific in that other isoforms of PKC, PKCϵ and λ, which also become tyrosine-phosphorylated, do not interact with Fyn. In addition, PKCδ does not interact with other platelet-expressed tyrosine kinases Syk, Src, or Btk. Stimulation also leads to activation of both Fyn and PKCδ and to serine phosphorylation of Fyn within a PKC consensus sequence. Alboaggregin-A-dependent activation of Fyn is blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I, suggesting a role for PKC isoforms in regulating Fyn activity. Platelet activation with alboaggregin-A induces translocation of the two kinases from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of platelets, as observed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Translocation of Fyn and PKCδ are blocked by PP1 and bisindolylmaleimide I, showing a dependence upon Src and PKC kinase activities. Although PKC activity is required for translocation, it is not required for association between the two kinases, because this was not blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I. Rottlerin, which inhibited PKCδ activity, did not block translocation of either PKCδ or Fyn but potentiated platelet aggregation, 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion, and the calcium response induced by alboaggregin-A, indicating that this kinase plays a negative role in the control of these processes. An increasing number of tyrosine kinases have been shown to associate with isoforms of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. Here, we show evidence for physical and functional interaction between PKCδ and the Src family kinase Fyn in human platelets activated by alboaggregin-A, a snake venom capable of activating both GPIb-V-IX and GPVI adhesion receptors. This interaction involves phosphorylation of PKCδ on tyrosine and is specific in that other isoforms of PKC, PKCϵ and λ, which also become tyrosine-phosphorylated, do not interact with Fyn. In addition, PKCδ does not interact with other platelet-expressed tyrosine kinases Syk, Src, or Btk. Stimulation also leads to activation of both Fyn and PKCδ and to serine phosphorylation of Fyn within a PKC consensus sequence. Alboaggregin-A-dependent activation of Fyn is blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I, suggesting a role for PKC isoforms in regulating Fyn activity. Platelet activation with alboaggregin-A induces translocation of the two kinases from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane of platelets, as observed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Translocation of Fyn and PKCδ are blocked by PP1 and bisindolylmaleimide I, showing a dependence upon Src and PKC kinase activities. Although PKC activity is required for translocation, it is not required for association between the two kinases, because this was not blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I. Rottlerin, which inhibited PKCδ activity, did not block translocation of either PKCδ or Fyn but potentiated platelet aggregation, 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion, and the calcium response induced by alboaggregin-A, indicating that this kinase plays a negative role in the control of these processes.

In addition, PKCμ and ν are considered as a fourth class, although some authors classify them as a separate family termed protein kinase D (1Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Google Scholar). Protein kinases C are critical for the regulation of several functional events in cells, including exocytosis and adhesion. In platelets, activation of PKC by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters can induce platelet degranulation (2Rink T.J. Sanchez A. Hallam T.J. Nature. 1983; 305: 317-319Google Scholar), and inhibitors of PKC effectively inhibit receptor-mediated platelet secretion (3Watson S.P. McNally J. Shipman L.J. Godfrey P.P. Biochem.

Gazzaniga P.P. Daniel J.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 87-90Google Scholar). It is now becoming clear, however, that different isoforms of PKC may play differential roles in the regulation of these events. Leitges et al. (14Leitges M. Gimborn K. Elis W. Kalesnikoff J. Hughes M.R. Krystal G. Huber M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3970-3980Google Scholar) have recently shown that PKCδ is a negative regulator of degranulation in mast cells, demonstrating a more complex role for the PKC family in control of this functional event. There are now known to be a variety of different mechanisms by which PKC activity and localization may be regulated, important among which is phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and more recently tyrosine residues (15Konishi H.

We have recently shown that the novel isoform, PKCθ, may be phosphorylated on tyrosine through a physical and functional association with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Btk (16Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9958-9965Google Scholar). The closely related kinase PKCδ has also been shown to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in a variety of cell types and in response to a variety of stimuli, including phorbol ester, growth factors, and hormones (17Konishi H.

We had shown that phosphorylation of PKCθ on tyrosine is associated with an inhibition of this isoform, but there is presently controversy concerning the functional role of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. In some reports activity of PKCδ is reduced by tyrosine phosphorylation (20Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Google Scholar, 21Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Google Scholar, 32Joseloff E. Cataisson C. Aamodt H. Ocheni H.

Differential effects upon activity may be accounted for by different sites of tyrosine phosphorylation within the protein by different upstream kinases. It has been shown that PKCδ may be phosphorylated by Fyn (18Gschwendt M. Kielbassa K. Kittstein W. Marks F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 85-89Google Scholar, 20Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W.

In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC isoforms, tyrosine kinases may in turn become reciprocally phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. There is substantial evidence of this for members of the Src family kinases. Src itself is phosphorylated by PKC isoforms (38Liebenhoff U. Greinacher A. Presek P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 645-652Google Scholar, 39Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2027-2035Google Scholar), and one isoform, PKCϵ, has been shown to lie upstream of activation of Src and Lyn in cardiac myocytes (40Ping P. Zhang J. Zheng Y.T. Li R.C. Dawn B. Tang X.L. Takano H. Balafanova Z. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 542-550Google Scholar). On the other hand, PKCδ has been shown to associate with Src and Lyn in mast cells, leading to reciprocal phosphorylation and a decrease in functional activity of Src and Lyn (33Song J.S. Swann P.G. Szallasi Z. Blank U. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3357-3368Google Scholar). Fyn has also been shown to be phosphorylated on serine residues (41Kypta R.M. Hemming A. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3837-3844Google Scholar, 42Cheng S.H. Espino P.C. Marshall J. Harvey R. Merrill J. Smith A.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 170-179Google Scholar). Cabodi et al. (43Cabodi S. Calautti E. Talora C. Kuroki T. Stein P.L. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1121-1129Google Scholar) have recently shown that one isoform of PKC, PKCη, associates with Fyn and is necessary and sufficient for activation of Fyn in keratinocytes. There is therefore evidence that, in other cell types, Fyn may associate physically and functionally with PKC isoforms, leading to modulation of its activity. In the present report we were interested in investigating the mutual regulation of PKCδ and Fyn in human platelets. We were able to show a physical interaction between the two kinases and phosphorylation of each kinase on both serine/threonine residues and tyrosines. Functionally, Fyn is shown to lie upstream of PKCδ, and PKC isoforms other than PKCδ lie upstream of Fyn positively regulating its activity and translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane. Trimeresurus albolabris venom was a kind gift from Professor R. G. D. Theakston (Liverpool, UK). Alboaggregin-A was prepared from venom by ion-exchange chromatography as previously described (44Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (TCS Biologicals Ltd., Bucks, UK). All anti-PKC antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Anti-Btk, Fyn, Src, and Syk antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-specific anti-Src (Tyr-416) and phospho-specific anti-PKC substrate antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (New England BioLabs, UK). Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 was from Alexis Corp. (Nottingham, UK). PKC inhibitor Bisindolylmaleimide I was from Tocris (Bristol, UK). PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. FITC-labeled anti-mouse, rabbit, and goat antibodies, calcium indicator Fura 2-AM, and myelin basic protein were from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK). LFM-A13 and Raytide™ peptide were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [3H]5-HT and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences (Amersham Biosciences, UK). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Human blood was drawn from healthy, drug-free volunteers on the day of the experiment. Acid citrate dextrose (ACD: 120 mm sodium citrate, 110 mm glucose, 80 mm citric acid, used at 1:7 v/v) was used as anticoagulant. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation at 200 × g, for 20 min, and platelets were then isolated by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g, in the presence of prostaglandin E1 (40 ng/ml). The pellet was resuspended to a density of 4 × 108 platelets/ml in a modified Tyrode's solution-HEPES buffer (145 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2,5mm glucose, pH 7.3). To this platelet suspension, 10 μm indomethacin was added, and a 30-min resting period was allowed before stimulation. Stimulation of platelets was performed in an aggregometer at 37 °C, with continuous stirring at 800 rpm, unless stated. Unless otherwise specified, all platelet stimulation occurred in the presence of EGTA (1 mm). Alboaggregin A was used at 3.5 μg/ml, unless otherwise stated, a concentration previously determined to be the EC50 value for induction of 5-HT release (44Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by lysis of platelets with an equal volume of either 2× Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (1% Nonidet P40, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.3) or 2× RIPA buffer (2% Triton X-100, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.3). Lysates were incubated with protein-A-Sepharose plus 1–2 μg of immunoprecipitating antibody for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed before addition of 2× Laemmli sample solvent and boiling for 5 min. For experiments involving assessment of phosphorylation of Fyn, to avoid contamination of immunoprecipitation samples with IgG heavy chain, it was necessary to covalently couple immunoprecipitating antibody to beads. This was achieved using a Seize X protein G immunoprecipitation kit (Perbio Science UK, Cheshire, UK), following the described protocol. Briefly, 100 μg of antibody was incubated with protein G-agarose beads for 1 h at room temperature to allow binding. Crosslinking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate was added for 1 h, and beads were then washed extensively to remove all free antibody. Antibodylinked beads were then added to samples and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed, and trapped protein was eluted by addition of elution buffer (pH 2.8). To the eluate, 5× Laemmli sample solvent was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 10–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Samples were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot SD semi-dry transfer cell, blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate primary antibody (1 μg/ml). Membranes were then washed before incubation with appropriate secondary antibody followed by thorough washing. Bound peroxidase activity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Autophosphorylation—PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from platelets lysed into Nonidet P-40 buffer and re-suspended in 20 μl of kinase assay (KA) buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ATP, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), and the reaction was started by adding [γ-32P]ATP (250 μCi/ml). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of ice-cold 100 mm EDTA. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then washed in RIPA buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE and detection of phosphorylated proteins by autoradiography. Raytide Phosphorylation—Fyn activity was assayed using Raytide peptide as an exogenous substrate. Immunoprecipitated kinase was resuspended in 20 μl of KA buffer and 10 μg of Raytide peptide added to each sample. The reaction was started by addition of 10 μl of ATP buffer (0.15 mm ATP, 30 mm MgCl2, and 200 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP in KA buffer). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 10% phosphoric acid. Samples were applied to 2 × 2 cm squares of P81 ion exchange chromatography paper, extensively washed in 0.5% phosphoric acid followed by a wash in acetone. Papers were then dried, and labeled Raytide was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Measurement of cytosolic calcium was performed as previously described (45Poole A.W. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 101-106Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μm Fura 2-AM was added to platelet-rich plasma, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 45 min in the presence of 10 μm indomethacin. Platelets were washed and re-suspended in modified Tyrode's solution and stimulated at room temperature in the absence of EGTA. Fluorescence excitation was made at 340 and 380 nm, and emission at 510 nm was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS5 spectrofluorometer. Data are presented as the excitation fluorescence ratio (340:380 nm). Platelets were loaded by incubation of PRP with 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]5-HT for 1 h at 37 °C. Platelets were preincubated with 1 mm EGTA before stimulation, to prevent aggregation. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of 6% glutaraldehyde in Tyrode's solution, followed by brief microcentrifugation, and [3H]5-HT released into the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting and expressed as a percentage of the total tissue content, as described previously (46Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Google Scholar). Platelets were stimulated with alboaggregin-A, and reactions were terminated by addition of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4). Samples were left under agitation for 30 min at room temperature. Platelets were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min in a microcentrifuge and washed twice in PBS. Platelets were immobilized on poly-lysine-coated coverslips overnight, permeabilized by incubation of coverslips with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS at room temperature for 10 min, and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with PBS/1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block nonspecific antibody binding. Samples were then incubated overnight with primary antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS, 1% BSA at 4 °C. Coverslips were then washed three times in PBS, 0.05% Triton X-100. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibody was then added at a concentration of 2 ng/ml in PBS/1% BSA, for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequent to this, coverslips were washed three times in PBS/0.05% Triton X-100 and then mounted onto slides using a 13.5% Mowiol solution containing 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane to prevent bleaching of fluorescence. Platelets were imaged using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with Kr/Ar laser (488-, 568-, and 647-nm lines) attached to a Leica DM IRBE inverted epifluorescence microscope with phase-contrast. Several PKC Isoforms Become Tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Platelet Activation by Alboaggregin-A—Tyrosine phosphorylation of various isoforms of PKC has been demonstrated in a number of cell types (15Konishi H.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1922-1929Google Scholar), and we have recently reported tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCθ induced by alboaggregin A in platelets (16Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9958-9965Google Scholar). Alboaggregin A is a purified lectin-type snake venom capable of binding to and activating both GP Ib and GP VI adhesion receptors on platelets for von Willebrand factor and collagen, respectively. Here we show that several other PKC isoforms are also phosphorylated on tyrosine upon alboaggregin-A stimulation of platelets (Fig. 1). These include the classic isoform β, the novel isoforms ϵ and δ and PKCλ, all of which were not phosphorylated under basal conditions, but became so upon platelet activation. PKCη was also investigated, but showed no tyrosine phosphorylation under these conditions. Association of PKC Isoforms with Platelet Non-receptor Tyrosine Kinases—We had previously shown that PKCθ physically and functionally associates with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Btk upon platelet activation (16Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9958-9965Google Scholar). It was important therefore to investigate whether other isoforms of PKC that become tyrosine-phosphorylated also associate with non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Syk, Src, Fyn, and Btk are four major platelet tyrosine kinases known to be involved in the alboaggregin-A-activated signaling pathway through activation of both GPIb-V-IX receptor complex and GPVI (16Crosby D. Poole A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9958-9965Google Scholar, 44Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Google Scholar, 48Wu Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Satoh K. Asazuma N. Yatomi Y.

Each of these kinases was immunoprecipitated from alboaggregin-A-activated platelets, and Fig. 2A shows that there is specific association between PKCδ and Fyn, whereas there is no co-association between PKCs ϵ or λ with any of the tyrosine kinases investigated. The association between PKCδ and Fyn was dependent upon activation (Fig. 2B) and was inhibited by PP1, a selective inhibitor of Src family kinases. Bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM), the broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor, had no effect upon the association between PKCδ and Fyn (Fig. 2C). Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Activity of PKCδ Is Dependent upon Src Kinase Activity and Is Up-regulated by Pre-treatment of Platelets with PKC Inhibitors—Fig. 3A shows that, under basal conditions, PKCδ is not tyrosine-phosphorylated. By 30 s of alboaggregin A stimulation, PKCδ had become tyrosine-phosphorylated, reaching a maximal by 60 s, and then subsequently decreasing by 120 s, although not back to basal levels. As PKCδ and Fyn associate, it was decided to investigate whether inhibition of either of these kinase activities would affect the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Fig. 3B shows that preincubation of platelets with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 ablates the alboaggregin-A-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. However, pretreatment of platelets with non-isozyme-specific inhibitor BIM (20 μm), or specific inhibition of PKCδ using rottlerin (also called mallotoxin, 10 μm), caused a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Immunoprecipitated PKCδ was subjected to in vitro kinase assay where activity is measured by autophosphorylation, and incorporation of 32P-labeled phosphate is visualized by autoradiography. Fig. 3C shows that PKCδ from resting platelets had a low level of activity but that, subsequent to alboaggregin A stimulation, its activity increased. On addition of BIM or rottlerin to the kinase assay buffer, activity of PKCδ was ablated. When PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from platelets preincubated with either BIM or rottlerin prior to stimulation, however, the in vitro activity of PKCδ was enhanced. PKCδ activity in contrast was fully inhibited when platelets were preincubated with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1. PKCδ Translocates to the Plasma Membrane upon Platelet Activation in a Manner Dependent upon Src Kinase Activity— Translocation of PKC isoforms from cytosol to plasma membrane is characteristic of PKC activation. It was therefore decided to examine the subcellular localization of PKCδ upon activation of platelets by alboaggregin-A, and to investigate the effect of inhibition of Src and PKC upon this translocation. Fig. 4A shows that, upon stimulation of platelets with alboaggregin-A, PKCδ, along with the other tyrosine-phosphorylated isoforms PKCλ and PKCϵ, translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. This translocation is prevented by pretreatment of platelets with PP1, the inhibitor of Src family kinases, as shown in Fig. 4B. This effect is specific to inhibition of Src kinases, because inhibition of Btk with LFM-A13 had no effect on translocation of PKCδ. Fig. 4B shows that the activity of PKC is essential for translocation of PKCδ to take place, because it is blocked by BIM, although not the activity of PKCδ itself, because inhibition of PKCδ with rottlerin did not affect its redistribution to the cell surface. Fyn Is Phosphorylated on Tyr-419 upon Activation in a Manner Dependent upon PKC and Src Kinase Activity—For full activity of Src kinases, a tyrosine residue within the activation loop of the catalytic domain (Tyr-419 for Fyn) must undergo autophosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 50Morgan D.O.

This unusual kinetics suggests physical separation of the sites for substrate binding and catalysis with binding of the transition state analogs to the catalytic site and not to the substrate binding site. Methods of inhibitor cross-competition kinetics and competition ligand binding were utilized to address whether non-transition state small molecule inhibitors, which also display non-competitive inhibition of γ-secretase, inhibit the enzyme by binding to the catalytic site as well. Inhibitor cross-competition kinetics indicated competitive binding between the transition state analogs PME and L685458 and between small molecules arylsulfonamides and benzodiazepines, but non-competitive binding between the transition state analogs and the small molecule inhibitors. These results were indicative of two inhibitor binding sites, one for transition state analogs and the other for non-transition state small molecule inhibitors. The presence of two inhibitor binding sites for two different classes of inhibitors was corroborated by results from competition ligand binding using [3H]L685458 as the radioligand. Although L685458 and PME displaced the radioligand at the same concentrations as for enzyme inhibition, arylsulfonamides and benzodiazepines did not displace the radioligand at their K i values, a result consistent with the presence of two inhibitor binding sites. These findings provide useful insights into the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of γ-secretase that may facilitate the design of novel γ-secretase inhibitors.

Therefore, strategies to reduce the level of brain Aβ are being aggressively pursued as an approach likely to benefit Alzheimer's disease patients. Aβ is produced as the result of sequential proteolysis of a type I transmembrane protein APP by β- and γ-secretases. β-Secretase cleaves APP in its extracellular domain at a site close to the membrane surface, a reaction that generates a membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragment of 99 amino acid residues (C99). A subsequent endoproteolysis within the transmembrane domain of C99 by γ-secretase produces Aβ. Whereas β-secretase, an aspartyl protease, has been well characterized (3Lin X. Keels G. Wu S. Downs D.

To a large extent, this is due to the highly complicated structural organization of this unusual protease. In contrast to other known proteases, γ-secretase is composed of a high molecular weight multicomponent complex of transmembrane proteins (13Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.-M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16470-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 14Li Y.-M.

Primarily due to this structural complexity, the catalytic site and mechanism of action of γ-secretase has not been unequivocally established. Early findings point to presenilin 1 or 2 as the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase (15Wolfe M.S. Xia W.M. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

However, the precise roles of these additional protein subunits in the catalytic mechanism of γ-secretase await further investigation. Associated with the structural complexity of γ-secretase is the versatility of this protease in cleaving several type I transmembrane proteins.

However, the mechanisms by which γ-secretase reacts with these different substrates remains unknown. Given the importance of γ-secretase in the Notch pathway, as well as its potential importance in pathways involving these other substrates, it is highly desirable to develop inhibitors selective for APP cleavage. Recent advances in understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of γ-secretase activity suggest that this may be possible. Transition state isosteres and small molecule inhibitors have been described for γ-secretase. Recently, PME and L685458, which are transition state isosteres, have been shown to display non-competitive inhibition of γ-secretase (34Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C. Zysk J. Liu X. Birr C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31499-31505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Inhibitors that bind to the catalytic site, as is normally expected for transition state isosteres, should impact similarly on the catalytic activities of the enzyme with different substrates. Inhibitors that target a substrate binding site or some other modulatory sites on γ-secretase may, on the other hand, display substrate-selective effects (34Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C. Zysk J. Liu X.

Interestingly, arylsulfonamides and benzodiazepines, which do not resemble transition state isosteres, also display non-competitive inhibition of γ-secretase (34Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C. Zysk J.

This raised the question of whether these small molecule inhibitors also affect γ-secretase activity by binding to the same site as the transition state isosteres or interact with γ-secretase at some other as yet unknown binding sites. To address this issue, we employed the methods of inhibitor cross-competition kinetics and competition ligand binding to characterize further the interactions of γ-secretase with transition state analogs (PME and L685458) and small molecule inhibitors (arylsulfonamide 1 and benzodiazepine 2, also known as compound E) (see Fig. 1). Data obtained from inhibitor cross-competition kinetics suggested the presence on γ-secretase of two inhibitor binding sites, one for binding of transition state isosteres and the other for non-transition state small molecule inhibitors. This observation was corroborated by results from competition ligand binding with the radioligand [3H]L685458. These findings provide useful insights into the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of γ-secretase that may facilitate the design of novel, and possibly substrate-selective, inhibitors.

Synthesis of [3H]L685458 —[3H]L685458 was synthesized by tritiation, under catalytic conditions, of {1S-benzyl-4R-[1-(1-carbamoyl-2-phenyl-ethylcarbamoyl)-1S-3-methyl-but-3-enylcarbamoyl]-2R-hy droxy5-phenyl-pentyl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (dehydroleucine derivative of L685458). The desired dehydroleucine derivative of L685458 was prepared by a method similar to that described for the synthesis of L685458 (35Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P.

Enzyme and Inhibition Kinetics—Enzyme and inhibition kinetics were performed using the methods as described previously (34Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C. Zysk J. Liu X. Birr C. Sylvester M.A. Edwards P.D.

All the reactions were run in 96-well microplates. Reactions with a final volume of 280 μl were run in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, containing C100 at a defined concentration, solubilized enzyme at 20–40-fold dilution from stock (prepared at either pH 8.4 or pH 6.5), inhibitor or inhibitors at different combinations of final concentrations diluted from a stock in Me2SO (final concentration of Me2SO was maintained at 5%), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25% CHAPSO, 0.01% phosphotidylethanolamide, and 0.01% phosphotidylcholine. The reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme, and 40-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were quenched at six different times by addition of 50 μl of 200 μm PME. A 50-μl solution containing 0.2 μg/ml RαAβ40 and 0.25 μg/ml biotin-4G8 was added to each quenched reaction mixture. The solutions were shaken in 96-well plates at 4 °C for >7 h. Subsequently, 50 μl of a solution containing 0.018 μg/ml Ru-GαR and 62.5 μg/ml Dynabeads was added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, at which time they were measured for ECL counts in an IGEN ECL M8 analyzer. Competition Ligand Binding—In a 96-well plate, 20 μl of [3H]L685458 (final concentration 1 nm) was mixed with 170 μl of solubilized γ-secretase at a final 10-fold dilution of the stock (prepared at pH 6.5) and 10 μl of a test compound (with a final concentration in the range of 100 pm to 30 μm) in Me2SO or in Me2SO only. The mixture was incubated on a plate shaker at room temperature for 30 min, and then filtered through Beckman GF/B filters (soaked in 0.6% polyethyleneimmine) using a Packard Filtermate-196 and washed six times with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After the filters dried, 30 μl of Microscint20 (Packard) was added to each well, and the plates were counted on a Packard TopCount. To assay binding of the radioligand itself, the same conditions were used as in the ligand competition studies, except that 12 concentrations (between 0.4 pm and 12 nm) of [3H]L685458 were used in the absence of test compound. Data Analysis—Time courses of γ-secretase reaction as monitored by ECL assay were analyzed by linear regression to obtain the slopes in counts/min. These values were then converted to pm/min by an ECL assay of an Aβ40 standard containing C100 at the same concentration as used in the reaction. IC50, the inhibitor concentration at which the enzyme activity is inhibited by 50%, was obtained by fitting inhibition data to, &x0025;Act=1001-[I]IC50+[I](Eq. 1) where %Act is calculated by dividing the ECL signal of a reaction mixture in the presence of inhibitor with the ECL signal obtained in its absence. For inhibitor cross-competition analyses, the theoretical inhibition kinetics of two inhibitors, I1 and I2, is given by, v=v01+[I1]Ki1+[I2]Ki2+[I1][I2]αKi1Ki2(Eq. 2) where ν0 is the initial rate in the absence of inhibitor, K i1 and K i2 are inhibition constants for I1 and I2, respectively, and α is the constant defining the interaction between the two inhibitors. The value of α equals unity for binding of the two inhibitors to enzyme independently. An α value of <1 indicates that binding of one inhibitor facilitates the binding of the other. A value of >1 indicates that binding of one inhibitor makes the binding of the other more difficult. An infinitely large α indicates that bindings of the two inhibitors are mutually exclusive or competitive. In the latter case, Equation 2 reduces to, v=v01+[I1]Ki1+[I2]Ki2(Eq. 3) which describes competitive binding. The pattern of binding of two inhibitors may be analyzed graphically by using the reciprocal of Equation 2, which is a linear function of 1/ν versus [I1], as given by, 1v=1v01+[I2]Ki2+1v0Ki11+[I2]Ki2[I1](Eq. 4) Changes in [I2] will have a slope effect if α is close to unity but will have no slope effect if it is infinitely large. Therefore, if the two inhibitors bind simultaneously to the enzyme, the reciprocal plots will intercept on, or to the left of, the 1/ν axis. If binding of one inhibitor excludes the binding of the other, the reciprocal plots will be a set of parallel lines. Data of radioligand [3H]L685458 binding to detergent extracts of HeLa cell membranes were analyzed by, [L685458]b=[L685458]bmax[L685458]Kd+[L685458](Eq. 5) where [L685458]b is the concentration of bound L685458, [L685458]bmax is the concentration of maximum bound ligand, and K d is the dissociation constant for the binding. The ligand displacement data were analyzed by, [L685458]b=1001-[I]Ki1+[L685458]tKd+[I](Eq. 6) where [L685458]t is the total concentration of L685458, and K i is the dissociation constant for I. Inhibitor Cross-competition Kinetics—The cross-competition method can provide information on whether enzyme inhibition in the presence of two inhibitors may arise from simultaneous binding to independent sites or mutually exclusive binding to a single site or overlapping sites on the enzyme. In this study, all possible binary combinations of the four inhibitors (PME, L685458, arylsulfonamide 1, and benzodiazepine 2, shown in Fig. 1) were investigated using this approach. The data were analyzed according to Equation 2 to extract the kinetic constants, and the reciprocal 1/ν was plotted against [I1] to visualize the slope effect from varying [I2]. Variation of [PME] in both directions in a binary combination was first performed to validate the method of inhibitor cross-competition kinetics for γ-secretase. As anticipated, variation of [PME] in one direction had no effect on the slope of the reciprocal plot obtained from variation of [PME] in the other direction, producing parallel plots as shown in Fig. 2A. The same parallel pattern was observed for the cross-competition between PME and L685458 (Fig. 2B), indicating competitive binding of PME and L685458. This result is consistent with the fact that both PME and L685458 are transition state isosteres, and therefore, are expected to bind to the same catalytic site of γ-secretase. Cross-competition pairs formed between L685458 and either of the small molecule inhibitors produced an intercepting, or non-competitive, binding pattern (Fig. 3), indicating that the small molecule inhibitors bind to one or two sites different from the site for the transition state analogs. The pattern for the kinetics of cross-competition between 1 and 2 was, however, parallel (Fig. 4), suggesting that it is a single site to which both 1 and 2 bind. The relatively small size of the α constants (1.7–2.5) obtained for the competitions between L685458 and the small molecule inhibitors 1 or 2 (Table I) indicated that binding of L685458 had little effect on binding of the small molecule inhibitors at a different site. The cross-competition between PME and 1 or 2 also displayed an intercepting, non-competitive pattern (Fig. 5). However, the size of the α values was relatively large (α = 7–17, Table I), suggesting that binding of PME affected somewhat the binding of 1 or 2 to the other binding site, making it more difficult for 1 or 2 to bind.Fig. 3Reciprocal plots for inhibitor cross-competition between L685458 and small molecule inhibitors.

The precise functions of βig-h3 are unknown, but it has been proposed that it may act as a cell adhesion molecule (18Kim J.E. Jeong H.W. Nam J.O. Lee B.H. Choi J.Y. Park R.W. Park J.Y. Kim I.S. J.

Genet. 1997; 15: 247-251Google Scholar) characterized by severe visual impairment resulting from the progressive accumulation of βig-h3-containing protein deposits in the corneal matrix (22Streeten B.W. Qi Y. Klintworth G.K. Eagle R.C.,Jr. Strauss J.A. Bennett K. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1999; 117: 67-75Google Scholar). Ultrastructural localization studies on developing tissues showed that in most instances βig-h3 was loosely associated with collagen fibers, although in developing kidney labeling was also observed close to the tubular and capsular basement membranes. Double immunolabeling experiments with antibodies to βig-h3 and collagen VI indicated that much of the βig-h3 was associated with collagen VI microfibrils rather than the collagen fibers themselves (7Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1683-1696Google Scholar). Collagen VI is present in the extracellular matrix of a wide range of tissues, usually as fine microfibrils 3–10 nm in diameter that exhibit a characteristic, double-beaded period of about 100 nm (23Timpl R. Chu M-L. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 207-242Google Scholar). In some tissues collagen VI appears to form additional structures including thicker cross-banded fibrils and hexagonal networks (24Bruns R.R. Press W. Engvall E. Timpl R. Gross J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 393-404Google Scholar, 25Reale E. Groos S. Luciano L. Eckardt C. Eckardt U. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 37-51Google Scholar). Collagen VI consists of monomers containing three distinct polypeptides, α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI), which form a triple helical collagenous central domain flanked by globular amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains. The monomers aggregate intracellularly, first into anti-parallel dimers with a 30-nm stagger and then into tetramers stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds before their secretion into the extracellular matrix (26Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Google Scholar). Ultrastructurally, the tetramers are symmetrical with double beads at each end of an extended central rod-like region. The outer beads represent the amino-terminal globular domains, and the inner beads correspond to the carboxyl-terminal globular domains (27Kuo H.J. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3757-3762Google Scholar). Extracellularly, the amino-terminal domains of the tetramers overlap end to end to form the collagen VI microfibrils (24Bruns R.R. Press W. Engvall E. Timpl R. Gross J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 393-404Google Scholar, 28Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Google Scholar). The microfibrils are resistant to digestion with bacterial collagenase (29Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1288-1295Google Scholar, 30Kielty C.M. Hanssen E. Shuttleworth C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 108-111Google Scholar), and treatment with pepsin removes the bulk of the globular domains from the tetramers but does not completely dissociate the microfibrils (28Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Google Scholar). However, the microfibrils can readily be dissociated into tetrameric subunits by treatment with a chaotropic agent (27Kuo H.J. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3757-3762Google Scholar) or low pH (31Spissinger T. Engel J. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 499-505Google Scholar), indicating that the subunits are not covalently linked together within the microfibrils. The precise functions of collagen VI are unclear, but the protein is considered to be important for tissue architecture, interconnecting structural components of the matrix with each other and with cells (23Timpl R. Chu M-L. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 207-242Google Scholar). Mutations in collagen VI genes have recently been linked to the muscle-wasting disease, Bethlem myopathy (32Jobsis G.J. Keizers H. Vreijling J.P. de Visser M. Speer M.C. Wolterman R.A. Baas F. Bolhuis P.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 113-115Google Scholar). In the present study we have isolated collagen VI microfibrils from collagenase-treated nuchal ligament and demonstrated that βig-h3 is covalently attached to collagen VI at regular intervals along at least some of the microfibrils. The binding site is located close to the amino-terminal end of the collagen VI molecule. Additional binding assays showed that rβig-h3 binds in vitro to collagen VI but in a non-covalent manner. The results indicate that direct βig-h3/collagen VI interactions occur in vivo, suggesting that they are likely to be important for the normal development and morphology of a range of tissues including cornea. Moreover these interactions appear to involve two distinct mechanisms of binding. Materials—Pepsin-treated collagen VI was prepared as described previously (33Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11149-11159Google Scholar). Individual α chains were prepared from the pepsin-collagen VI by high performance liquid chromatography. Briefly, reduced and alkylated pepsin-collagen VI was chromatographed on a Protein Pak DEAE-5PW column (Waters) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.4, containing 6 m urea using a linear gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl gradient (50 ml). The polypeptides eluted in the order pepsin-α3 (VI), pepsin-α2 (VI), and pepsin-α1 (VI) (data not shown). The polypeptides were dialyzed into TBS before use in the binding assay. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to pepsin-treated collagen VI and to βig-h3 peptide TQLYTDRTEKLRPEMEG have been described previously (7Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1683-1696Google Scholar). Highly purified bacterial collagenase (type VII) and hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus were purchased respectively from Sigma and Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Isolation of Collagen VI Microfibrils—Collagen VI microfibrils were purified using a method based on that of Kielty et al. (30Kielty C.M. Hanssen E. Shuttleworth C.A. Anal.

Briefly, nuchal ligament tissue (9 g) from a bovine fetus of 200 days of gestation was finely diced with a razor blade, rinsed several times with TBS, and resuspended in 18 ml of collagenase digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was incubated with 1.8 mg of collagenase (specific activity = 1980 units/mg) for 8hat37 °C then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was chromatographed in 3 batches on a column of Sepharose CL-2B (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated in Tris/NaCl buffer (composition as above but lacking CaCl2). Flow rate was 30 ml/h, and 3-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing βig-h3 and collagen VI were identified by direct dot blotting on nylon membranes with specific antibodies. The void volume peaks from the 3 runs were combined and treated with 5 units of hyaluronidase for 24 h at 4 °C. Samples of this digest were then analyzed by CsCl density gradient centrifugation in Tris/NaCl buffer (native conditions) or in Tris/NaCl buffer containing 4 m GdnHCl (denaturing conditions). Each sample was adjusted to a density of 1.30 g/ml with CsCl and then ultracentrifuged in a 70.1 Ti head (Beckman) at 30,000 rpm (62,000 × g) at 15 °C for 72 h. Each gradient was divided into 15 fractions, and those containing βig-h3 and collagen VI were identified by dot blotting. Those fractions containing collagen VI microfibrils were analyzed by rotary shadowing (see below in “Experimental Procedures”) and by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (34Gibson M.A. Hughes J.L. Fanning J.C. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 26: 111429-111436Google Scholar) except that PVDF-Plus membranes (Osmonics, Westborough, MA) were used. In some instances, samples were pretreated with 10 mm cysteine followed by 40 mm iodoacetamide using a previously described method (33Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11149-11159Google Scholar). Rotary Shadowing and Immunogold Labeling—Samples (5 μl) from selected the CsCl gradient fractions were applied for 10 s to Formvarcoated nickel grids either directly or after adjustment to 4 m GdnHCl to depolymerize the collagen VI microfibrils into tetramer subunits. The grids were then rinsed with 3 changes of TBS and incubated with a 1:20 dilution of anti-(βig-h3 peptide) antibody (or a control antibody) in TBS plus Tween (0.05%) for 30 min. Grids were then rinsed again with TBS and incubated further with anti-(rabbit IgG) antibody conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (Auroprobe EM GAR G10, Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. After further rinsing with TBS, the grids were dried, and rotary shadowed with platinum at an angle of 8° under a vacuum of 2 × 10–6 torr in a Cressington CFE50 Freeze Etch Unit. Each grid was observed using a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Expression and Purification of rβig-h3—Total RNA was purified as described previously from cultured osteoblast-like cells derived from a trabecular bone biopsy (12Kitahama S. Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Hay S. Kuliwaba J.L. Evdokiou A. Atkins G.J. Findlay D.M. Bone (NY). 2000; 27: 61-67Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized using total RNA (1 μg), random hexamer primers (50 ng), and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (200 units) (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The βig-h3 cDNA was then amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-CCCGCTCCATGGCGCTCTTCGTG-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCCGTGGTGCATTCCTCCTGTAGT-3′, and high fidelity Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR was conducted as described previously for 28 cycles with an annealing temperature of 60 °C (12Kitahama S. Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Hay S. Kuliwaba J.L. Evdokiou A. Atkins G.J. Findlay D.M. Bone (NY). 2000; 27: 61-67Google Scholar). The PCR product (2092 bp) was purified by gel electrophoresis, A-tailed by incubation with dATP, and platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) at 70 °C for 30 min, and cloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. An authentic βig-h3 cDNA clone was selected, and a sequence encoding a His6 tag was inserted into the construct using site-directed mutagenesis with a complementary pair of primers (5′-GGGTCCCGCCAAGCATCACCACCATCACCATTCGCCCTACCAGCTGGTG-3′ and 5′-CACCAGCTGGTAGGGCGAATGGTGATGGTGGTGATGCTTGGCGGGACCC-3′) and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Again an authentic cDNA clone was selected, excised with NotI from the T-easy vector, and subcloned into the NotI site of the mammalian expression vector, pCEP4 (Invitrogen). Several clones were fully sequenced to check for errors, and the selected construct (pCEP/BH18) was transfected into 293-EBNA cells using the LipofectAMINE 2000 system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were established in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin, streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids and selected with hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Recombinant βig-h3 was harvested from the conditioned medium of confluent cells that had been incubated for 4 days in the above medium without serum. The medium was adjusted to binding conditions using an 8× stock of binding buffer (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.60, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole) and loaded onto a nickel-agarose column (chelating-Sepharose fast flow, Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer, and rβig-h3 was then eluted using the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The quality and yield of rβig-h3 was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-(penta-His) antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and anti-(βig-h3 peptide) antibody. Radiolabeling of rβig-h3—Recombinant βig-h3 was biosynthetically radiolabeled by incubating the transfected 293-EBNA cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium depleted in cysteine and methionine for 3 days with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at 100 μCi/ml. The 35S-labeled rβig-h3 was then purified from the medium as described above. Binding Assays—Solid phase binding assays were conducted as described previously (35Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates (Immuno Maxisorp modules; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with collagen VI at 4 °C for 18 h. Control wells were coated with BSA at the same concentration. After rinsing with TBS the wells were blocked in 3% nonfat dried milk in TBS for 1 h. After further rinsing, the wells were incubated either with unlabeled rβig-h3 or with 35S-labeled rβig-h3 for 3 h at 37 °C. See Figs. 6 and 5, respectively, for details. The wells were extensively rinsed with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS. Binding of unlabeled rβig-h3 was measured using anti-βig-h3 antibody and a peroxide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (35Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Google Scholar), and that of 35S-labeled rβig-h3 was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In some binding experiments, samples of rβig-h3 were pretreated with 40 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm cysteine, or cysteine followed by iodoacetamide using a previously described method (33Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11149-11159Google Scholar) and then dialyzed into TBS before use in the binding assay. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction of βig-h3 with collagen VI was calculated from non-linear regression analysis of the specific binding curve using the Prism program version 3 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA).Fig. 5Recombinant βig-h3 interacts with triple-helical collagen VI but not individual α chains.Panel A shows solid phase binding assays. Purified proteins (500 ng/well) were coated onto microtiter plates. After blocking, 7 × 103 dpm of 35S-labeled rβig-h3 (specific activity 3.5 × 105 dpm/μg) was added, and the wells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After washing, binding was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Column 1, native collagen VI microfibrils; column 2, pepsin-collagen VI; column 3, pepsin-α 1 (VI); column 4, pepsin-α 2 (VI); column 5, pepsin-α 3 (VI); column 6, BSA. Panel B shows that in the solid phase assay, the binding of rβig-h3 is proportional to the amount of pepsin-collagen VI on the well. Pepsin-VI collagen was coated onto microtiter wells in serial dilution and incubated with 35S-labeled rβig-h3 as described in panel A. Panel C shows co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 35S-Labeled rβig-h3 (1 × 104 dpm) was incubated with 1 μg of pepsin-collagen VI, individual α chains, or BSA for 4 h at 37 °C. Collagen VI species were then recovered by the addition of anti-collagen VI antibody followed by protein A-Sepharose. Co-immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled rβig-h3 was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Column 1, pepsin-collagen VI; column 2, pepsin-α 1 (VI); column 3, pepsin-α 2 (VI); column 4, pepsin-α 3 (VI); column 5, BSA control. In all panels, the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed following a previously described method (36Reinboth B. Hanssen E. Cleary E.G. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3950-3957Google Scholar) using affinity-purified collagen VI antibody (1 μl) followed by protein A-Sepharose (20 μl). See Fig. 5 for details. Co-immunoprecipitated 35S-labeled rβig-h3 was measured by liquid scintillation counting. For rotary shadowing analysis of binding interactions, pepsin-collagen VI (0.04 nmol) and rβig-h3 (0.02 nmol) were incubated together for 1 h in TBS, coated onto grids, and immunogold-labeled for βig-h3 as described above. For a negative control, pepsin-collagen VI was incubated without rβig-h3. βig-h3 Co-purifies with Collagen VI Microfibrils—A collagenase-digested extract of nuchal ligament tissue was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B (Fig. 1A). Dot blotting revealed that most of the collagen VI was present in the Vo peak (peak 1), consistent with the molecule being present as microfibrillar aggregates. Interestingly, a significant signal for βig-h3 was also detected in the Vo peak. To isolate collagen VI microfibrils, the Vo peak was treated with hyaluronidase and analyzed by CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. The gradient was selected so that collagen VI banded in the middle of the gradient with a buoyant density of about 1.3 g/ml, whereas fibrillin-containing microfibrils migrated to the bottom of the tube and other proteins occupied the fractions at the top of the gradient (Fig. 1B). Dot blotting showed that the βig-h3 in the sample co-distributed precisely with the collagen VI microfibrils under non-denaturing conditions (NaCl) and under denaturing conditions (4 m GdnHCl) even though the buoyant density of the denatured collagen VI had decreased slightly. Rotary shadowing of fraction 7 from the non-denatured gradient revealed that type VI collagen microfibrils were the only discernable structures present (data not shown). βig-h3 Is Covalently Bound to Collagen VI Tetramers in Nuchal Ligament Tissue—SDS-PAGE analysis of fraction 7 under reducing conditions on a 12% gel revealed several bands around 200 kDa, a strongly staining band at 140 kDa, and a band at 66 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 1). No other protein bands were detected on the gel. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the 66-kDa band was βig-h3 (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and that the 200- and 140-kDa bands were collagen VI polypeptides corresponding, respectively, to isoforms of the α3 (VI) chain and a mixture of the α1 (VI) and α2 (VI) chains (Fig. 2A, lane 3). When the sample was analyzed under non-reducing conditions no bands were detected on 12% gels (data not shown). This finding indicated that both βig-h3 and collagen VI were present as high molecular weight aggregates. However, when the sample was analyzed on a 3–5% gradient gel under non-reducing conditions, a single slowly migrating band was detected (Fig. 2B, lane 2) similar in size to the tetrameric form of collagen VI (apparent Mr ∼2,000,000). The band stained with antibodies to βig-h3 (Fig. 2B, lane 4) and collagen VI (Fig. 2B, lane 6), suggesting that the two proteins were present in the same complex. When analyzed under reducing conditions the complex was disrupted, and bands corresponding to βig-h3 and collagen VI were again the only bands detected in the sample (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Colorimetric analysis of the Coomassie Blue staining of the bands indicated an approximate molecular ratio of one molecule of βig-h3 to two collagen VI monomers assuming that both protein exhibit similar uptake of stain. In a further experiment an aliquot of fraction 7 was treated with a mild reducing agent, 10 mm cysteine, followed by the alkylating agent iodoacetamide to irreversibly break intermolecular but not intramolecular disulfide bonds. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE on composite agarose-polyacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions, bands corresponding to collagen VI tetramers, dimers, and monomers were obtained (Fig. 2C, lane 1), which immunoblotted with anti-(collagen VI) antibodies (Fig. 2C, lane 3). However, immunoblotting with anti-βig-h3 antibodies stained only the βig-h3 polypeptide (migrating at the dye front on gels of this porosity) and not the collagen VI bands, indicating that the covalent bonds between βig-h3 and collagen VI had been completely disrupted by the cysteine treatment (Fig. 2C, lane 2).

To identify molecules that converge in both processes, an overlapping pathway screening was employed that identified old-35, which is human polynucleotide phosphorylase (hPNPaseold-35), a 3′,5′-exoribonuclease. We previously demonstrated that hPNPaseold-35 is a type I interferon-inducible gene that is also induced in senescent fibroblasts. In vitro RNA degradation assays confirmed its exoribonuclease properties, and overexpression of hPNPaseold-35 resulted in growth suppression in HO-1 human melanoma cells. The present study examined the molecular mechanism of the growth-arresting property of hPNPaseold-35. When overexpressed by means of a replication-incompetent adenoviral vector (Ad.hPNPaseold-35), hPNPaseold-35 inhibited cell growth in all cell lines tested. Analysis of cell cycle revealed that infection of HO-1 cells with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 resulted in arrest in the G1 phase and eventually apoptosis accompanied by marked reduction in the S phase. Infection with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 resulted in reduction in expression of the c-myc mRNA and Myc protein and modulated the expression of proteins regulating G1 checkpoint and apoptosis. In vitro mRNA degradation assays revealed that hPNPaseOLD-35 degraded c-myc mRNA. Overexpression of Myc partially but significantly protected HO-1 cells from Ad.hPNPaseold-35-induced growth arrest, indicating that Myc down-regulation might directly mediate the growth-inhibitory properties of Ad.hPNPaseold-35. Inhibition of hPNPaseold-35 by an antisense approach provided partial but significant protection against interferon-β-mediated growth inhibition, thus demonstrating the biological significance of hPNPaseold-35 in interferon action.

There are two contrasting endpoints in the life of a replicating cell. One involves the normal physiological processes of differentiation or senescence. The other is the pathological process of neoplastic transformation characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and de-differentiation. Treatment of HO-1 metastatic human melanoma cells with fibroblast interferon (IFN-β) 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; MEZ, mezerein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; pfu, plaque-forming unit(s); AS, antisense; HA, hemagglutinin; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Rb, retinoblastoma; GAPDH, glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. and the protein kinase C activator mezerein (MEZ) induces irreversible growth arrest and terminal differentiation characterized by changes in cell morphology, increase in melanin synthesis, modifications in gene expression, and alterations in surface antigen expression (1Fisher P.B.

Replicative or cellular senescence, a process leading to irreversible arrest of cell division, was first described in cultures of human fibroblasts that lost the ability to divide upon continuous subcultures (6Hayflick L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 295: 1302-1308Google Scholar). Replicative senescence can result from telomere shortening linked with a DNA end-replication problem, overexpression of certain oncogenes, or tumor suppressor genes, or it can be stress-induced premature senescence after exposure to a variety of oxidative stresses or DNA damaging agents (for a review, see Ref. 7Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 748-753Google Scholar). Terminal differentiation and cellular senescence share several common traits including irreversible growth arrest and changes in gene expression profiles. To understand the molecular and biochemical basis of the complex physiological changes associated with these phenomena, an overlapping pathway screen was used to identify genes displaying coordinated expression as a consequence of both processes (8Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.-C. Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Holmes M. Valerie K. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16636-16641Google Scholar). A temporally spaced terminally differentiated human melanoma subtracted cDNA library was screened with cDNAs derived from senescent progeroid fibroblast cells. This led to the identification of old-35, which is human polynucleotide phosphorylase (hPNPaseold-35), a 3′,5′ exoribonuclease involved in RNA degradation (8Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.-C. Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Holmes M. Valerie K. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16636-16641Google Scholar). hPNPaseold-35 is a highly evolutionary conserved gene in plants, prokaryotes and eukaryotes having similar domain structure and functional properties in all species. In vitro assays confirmed that hPNPaseold-35 is involved in RNA degradation. Analysis of the expression profile of hPNPaseold-35 revealed that it is predominantly a type I interferon-inducible gene, and its expression is also induced in senescent fibroblasts in comparison with young fibroblasts. These findings indicate that hPNPaseold-35 might play an essential role in interferon- and senescence-induced growth arrest. Indeed, when hPNPaseold-35 is transfected by plasmid or transduced via a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad.hPNPaseold-35), there is a marked reduction in the colony-forming ability of HO-1 cells. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the growth-suppressing property of Ad.hPNPaseold-35. The protooncogene c-myc is involved in a wide range of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (for a recent review, see Ref. 9Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar). Myc belongs to the Max network, a group of transcription factors containing basic helix-loop-helix zipper motifs (10Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Google Scholar, 11Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. et al.Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Google Scholar). Myc heterodimerizes with Max and binds to the E-box sequence (CACGTG), thereby activating transcription (12Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Google Scholar). Max is constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle (13Blackwood E.M. Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 71-80Google Scholar), and it also heterodimerizes with the Mad family of transcription factors: Mad1, Mxi1, Mad3, and Mad4 (14Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2110-2119Google Scholar, 15Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Google Scholar, 16Hurlin P.J. Queva C. Koskinen P.J. Steingrimsson E. Ayer D.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5646-5659Google Scholar); however, in contrast to Myc-Max, the Mad-Max heterodimers act as transcriptional repressors at the same binding sites. The most important function of Myc is its essential role in controlling cell proliferation. Expression of exogenous Myc in cultured fibroblasts promotes S phase entry and shortens G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas activation of a conditional Myc is sufficient to drive quiescent cells into the cell cycle (17Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Google Scholar, 18Karn J. Watson J.V. Lowe A.D. Green S.M. Vedeckis W. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 773-787Google Scholar). The progression of cell cycle beyond the G1 phase is also augmented by the activities of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2, and the activities of these complexes are inhibited by CDK inhibitors, the Cip/Kip (CDK-interacting protein/kinase-inhibitory protein) family, including p27KIP1 and p21CIP1/WAF-1/MDA-6 and the INK (inhibitors of CDK4) family including p16INK4A and p15INK4B (19Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Google Scholar). Cyclins D and E are essential for G1-S progression in higher eukaryotic cells and when overexpressed are able to shorten the G1 interval (20Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Google Scholar, 21Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Google Scholar). The major pathway by which Myc induces cell cycle progression is by activating cyclin D2 and CDK4 (22Bouchard C. Thieke K. Maier A. Saffrich R. Hanley-Hyde J. Ansorge W. Reed S. Sicinski P. Bartek J. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5321-5333Google Scholar, 23Perez-Roger I. Solomon D.L. Sewing A. Land H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2373-2381Google Scholar, 24Hermeking H. Rago C. Schuhmacher M. Li Q.

An important consequence of the induction by Myc of cyclin D2 is its sequestration of p27KIP1 CDK inhibitor, permitting unfettered and prolonged activity of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex (26Pusch O. Bernaschek G. Eilers M. Hengstschlager M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 649-656Google Scholar). Increased cyclin E-CDK2 activity shortens G1, whereas increased CDK2 and CDK4 activities result in hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. This leads to release of E2F, a family of transcription factors that regulate a battery of genes necessary for cell cycle progression, from complexes with Rb and together with the direct induction of E2F2 by Myc, may further contribute to cell cycle progression (27Sears R. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5227-5235Google Scholar). In addition Myc can directly repress p27KIP1 and p21CIP1/WAF-1/MDA-6 transcription (28Yang W. Shen J. Wu M. Arsura M. FitzGerald M. Suldan Z. Kim D.W. Hofmann C.S. Pianetti S. Romieu-Mourez R. Freedman L.P. Sonenshein G.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1688-1702Google Scholar, 29Claassen G.F. Hann S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9498-9503Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that infection of HO-1 melanoma cells with Ad.hPNPaseold-35resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and eventually apoptosis with marked reduction in DNA synthesis. Ad.hPNPaseold-35infection caused reduction in expression of the c-myc mRNA and Myc protein that was accompanied by induction of Mad1 protein. Overexpression of Myc protected HO-1 cells against Ad.hPNPaseold-35-mediated cell death. These findings argue that Myc might play a pivotal role in mediating the growth-inhibitory properties of Ad.hPNPaseold-35. We also show that inhibition of hPNPaseold-35 by an antisense strategy partially but significantly rescues HO-1 cells from interferon-β-mediated growth inhibition, thereby documenting a potential role of hPNPaseold-35 in mediating interferon action. Cell Lines and Cell Viability Assays—Normal immortal human melanocyte (FM516-SV; FM516), WM35 early radial growth phase, and WM278 vertical growth phase primary human melanomas, and HO-1, FO-1, and MeWo metastatic melanoma cell lines and HEK-293 cells were cultured as previously described (30Lebedeva I.V.

HO-1-pREP4 and HO-1-hPNPaseold-35AS cell lines were generated by stable transfection of HO-1 cells with pREP4 (HO-1-pREP4) or antisense hPNPaseold-35 expressing pREP4 (HO-1-hPNPaseold-35AS), respectively, and selection with hygromycin. HO-1-Bcl-2 and HO-1-Bcl-xL cell lines were produced by stable transfection of HO-1 cells with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression plasmids (kindly provided by Dr. John C. Reed) and selection with G418. Cell growth and viable cell numbers were monitored by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining as described (30Lebedeva I.V. Su Z.Z. Chang Y. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 708-718Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated with interferon-β (2000 units/ml) and mezerein (10 ng/ml) for 5 days prior to assaying for cell viability. Virus Construction and Infection Protocol—The construction and purification of hPNPaseold-35 expressing replication-defective adenovirus Ad.hPNPaseold-35were described previously (8Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.-C. Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Holmes M. Valerie K. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16636-16641Google Scholar, 31Valerie K. Wu-Pong S. Rojanasakul Y. Biopharmaceutical Drug Design and Development. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 69-142Google Scholar). A similar method was employed to generate an antisense hPNPaseold-35 expressing replication-defective adenovirus (Ad.hPNPaseold-35AS). The empty adenoviral vector (Ad.vec) was used as a control. Viral infections were performed as previously described (30Lebedeva I.V. Su Z.Z. Chang Y. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 708-718Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction, Transfection, and Colony Formation Assays— 3′-HA-tagged hPNPaseold-35 was created by PCR using the primers GCT AGC ATG GCG GCC TGC AGG TAC (sense) and GGA TCC TCA AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC GTA TGG GTA CTG AGA ATT AGA TGA TGA (antisense). The authenticity of the amplified product was verified by sequencing, and it was cloned into the NheI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate hPNPaseold-35-HA. hPNPaseold-35AS was generated by ligating hPNPaseold-35 in an antisense orientation into BamHI/NotI sites of pREP4 (Invitrogen). The c-myc expression plasmid p290-myc (2Fisher P.B. Prignoli D.R. Hermo Jr., H. Weinstein I.B. Pestka S. J. Interferon Res. 1985; 5: 11-22Google Scholar, 3Graham G.M. Guarini L. Moulton T.A. Datta S. Ferrone S. Giacomini P. Kerbel R.S. Fisher P.B. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1991; 32: 382-390Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Riccardo Dalla-Favera. HO-1 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/6-cm dish and 24 h later were transfected with 5 μg of either empty vector or p290-myc (2Fisher P.B. Prignoli D.R. Hermo Jr., H. Weinstein I.B. Pestka S. J. Interferon Res. 1985; 5: 11-22Google Scholar, 3Graham G.M. Guarini L. Moulton T.A. Datta S. Ferrone S. Giacomini P. Kerbel R.S. Fisher P.B. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1991; 32: 382-390Google Scholar) using Superfect® (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) transfection reagent according to the protocol from the manufacturer. After 36 h, the cells were infected with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50 or 100 pfu/cell; 6 h later, the cells were trypsinized and counted and 103 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes. Colonies were counted after 3 weeks. Colony formation assays using hPNPaseold-35-HA in HO-1 cells were performed as described (32Kang D.C. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Wu Q. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 637-642Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the protocol from the manufacturer, and Northern blotting was performed as described (33Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Lebedeva I.V. Sauane M. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Valerie K. Dent P. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10054-10059Google Scholar). The cDNA probes used were a 400-bp fragment from human c-myc, a 500-bp fragment from hPNPaseold-35, a 500-bp fragment from human GADD34, full-length human c-jun, and full-length human GAPDH. In Vitro Translation and in Vitro mRNA Degradation Assays—In vitro translation was performed using the TNT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega, Madison, WI) using the plasmids pcDNA3.1 as a control, GADD153 expression plasmid, and hPNPaseold-35-HA according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Five μg of total RNA from HO-1 cells were incubated with 5 μl of each in vitro translated protein at 37 °C from 0.5 to 3 h. The RNA was repurified using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, and Northern blotting was performed (33Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Lebedeva I.V. Sauane M. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Valerie K. Dent P. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10054-10059Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed as previously described (33Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Lebedeva I.V. Sauane M. Gopalkrishnan R.V. Valerie K. Dent P. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10054-10059Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm NaF and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as total cell lysate. Thirty μg of total cell lysate were used for SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The primary antibodies included: Myc (1:200; mouse monoclonal), Max (1: 200; rabbit polyclonal), Mad1 (1:200; rabbit polyclonal), p16 (1:200; rabbit polyclonal), p21 (1:200; rabbit polyclonal), p27 (1:200; rabbit polyclonal), p53 (1:200; mouse monoclonal), cyclin E (1:200, rabbit polyclonal), and E2F1 (1:200, rabbit polyclonal) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Rb (1:500, mouse monoclonal) and cyclin A (1:500, mouse monoclonal) (from BD Biosciences); Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax (1:1000; rabbit polyclonal; kindly provided by Dr. John C. Reed); anti-HA (1:3000; mouse monoclonal; Covance Research Products, Inc., Berkeley, CA); and EF1α (1:1000; mouse monoclonal; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA). [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—HO-1 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells in each well of a 12-well plate. The next day the cells were infected with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 at an m.o.i. of 25 or 50 pfu/cell. After 4 days the cells were incubated with 10 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 12 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 2 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated materials were collected by centrifugation and solubilized with 1 ml of 2% SDS, and 100-μl aliquots were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Cell Cycle Analysis— Cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed overnight at –20 °C in 70% ethanol. The cells were treated with RNase A (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min and then with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). Cell cycle was analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer, and data were analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Telomerase Assay—HO-1 cells were infected with either Ad.vec or Ad.hPNPaseold-35 for 1–4 days or untreated or treated with fibroblast IFN-β (2000 units/ml) plus MEZ (10 ng/ml) for 1–4 days, and telomerase assays were performed as described previously (34Wood L.D. Halvorsen T.L. Dhar S. Baur J.A. Pandita R.K. Wright W.E. Hande M.P. Calaf G. Hei T.K. Levine F. Shay J.W. Wang J.J. Pandita T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 278-288Google Scholar). Briefly, protein concentrations of cell extracts were determined, and equal amounts of protein were used for the elongation process in which telomerase added telomeric repeats (TTAGGG) to the 3′ end of the biotin-labeled primer. These elongation products were amplified by PCR, and the PCR products were denatured and hybridized to digoxigenin-labeled detection probes, specific for the telomeric repeats. The resulting products were immobilized via the biotin label to a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate. Immobilized amplicons were detected with an antibody against digoxigenin that is conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the sensitive peroxidase substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The telomerase activity was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the samples at 450 nm (with a reference wavelength of 690 nm) using a microtiter plate reader. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using oneway analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference analysis. Previous studies demonstrated that infection with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 inhibited colony formation in HO-1 melanoma cells (8Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.-C. Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Holmes M. Valerie K. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16636-16641Google Scholar). The present studies were conducted to comprehend the molecular mechanism underlying the growth-arresting property of Ad.hPNPaseold-35. Different melanoma cell lines and SV40 T-Ag immortalized primary human melanocytes (FM-516-SV) were infected with Ad.hPNPaseold-35, and the growth of the cells was monitored by standard MTT assays. As shown in Fig. 1, infection with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 resulted in significant growth inhibition in all of the cells. The growth-inhibitory effect became significant from 4 days after infection, and, in certain cell lines (WM278 and MeWo), infection with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 completely inhibited cell growth. In addition, Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection inhibited the growth of other cell types, including breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic carcinomas, glioblastoma multiforme, fibrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma, irrespective of their p53 or Rb status (data not shown). To investigate the mechanism of Ad.hPNPaseold-35-mediated growth inhibition, cell cycle analysis was performed following Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection in HO-1 cells. When the cells were infected with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 at a high m.o.i. of 100 pfu/cell for 4 days, there was a significant increase in sub-G0 population of cells indicating apoptosis and a decrease in the S phase indicating inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 2, A and B). When the kinetics of killing was slowed down by infecting cells at a low m.o.i. of 25 pfu/cell, there was an initial significant increase in cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 2, C and D) at 3 and 6 days after infection. This increase was also accompanied by a marked decrease in the S phase. At later time points, the cells infected with Ad.hPNPaseold-35, but not control or Ad.vec-infected cells, started to die by apoptosis (Fig. 2D). The kinetics of cell death was very slow when HO-1 cells were infected with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 at a low m.o.i. It is worth noting that at 25 pfu/cell ∼90% of the cells are infected with adenovirus (data not shown). From these observations it might be inferred that infection with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 induces cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase that ultimately culminates in apoptosis. The inhibition of DNA synthesis following Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection was confirmed using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, infection with Ad.vec did not have an impact on DNA synthesis. Infection with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 reduced DNA synthesis by ∼40% at an m.o.i. of 25 pfu/cell and by ∼75% at 50 pfu/cell 4 days after infection. Telomerase activity is decreased in both terminal differentiation and senescence. As shown in Fig. 3B, telomerase activity decreased in a time-dependent manner to ∼50% when HO-1 cells were treated with IFN-β + MEZ for up to 4 days. This treatment protocol results in the induction of irreversible growth arrest and terminal differentiation in HO-1 melanoma cells (2Fisher P.B. Prignoli D.R. Hermo Jr., H. Weinstein I.B. Pestka S. J. Interferon Res. 1985; 5: 11-22Google Scholar, 5Jiang H. Su Z.Z. Boyd J. Fisher P.B. Mol. Cell Differ. 1993; 1: 41-66Google Scholar). Based on these findings, telomerase activity was also determined following Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection. As shown in Fig. 3C, infection with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 at an m.o.i. of 100 pfu/cell, but not with Ad.vec, inhibited telomerase activity by almost 60% at day 4 after infection. One of the factors that facilitate entry into the S phase of the cell cycle is Myc. During terminal differentiation of melanoma cells, c-myc mRNA expression is down-regulated (35Jiang H. Lin J. Young S.M. Goldstein N.I. Waxman S. Davila V. Chellappan S.P. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1179-1189Google Scholar). The expression level of c-myc mRNA following Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection was, therefore, determined by Northern blot analysis. The expression of c-myc mRNA began decreasing 2 days after Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection but not in uninfected or Ad.vec-infected cells even at 4 days after infection (Fig. 4A). This decrease correlates with the expression of hPNPaseold-35 mRNA that was also detected 2 days after infection. It should be noted that, under basal condition, hPNPaseold-35 mRNA is undetectable in HO-1 cells. The expression of the GAPDH housekeeping gene remained unchanged following Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection. Down-regulation of Myc protein by different stimuli is usually accompanied by up-regulation of Mad1, the transcriptional repressor belonging to the Max family of transcription factors (9Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar). In this context, the expressions of Myc, its heterodimer partner Max, and Mad1 were determined by Western blot analysis following Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection. As anticipated from Northern blot analysis, Myc expression started decreasing 2 days after Ad.hPNPaseold-35 infection but not in uninfected or Ad.vec-infected cells at 4 days after infection (Fig. 4B). This down-regulation was accompanied by up-regulation of Mad1 protein. The level of Max protein remained unchanged, indicating that infection with Ad.hPNPaseold-35 switches the Myc-Max transcriptional activator to Mad1-Max transcriptional repressor. The expression level of the EF1α housekeeping gene did not change under any condition. We next addressed whether c-myc overexpression could protect HO-1 cells from Ad.hPNPaseold-35-mediated cell death. At first we determined whether the Myc expression plasmid generates the appropriate protein. For this assay, HEK-293 cells were used because transfection efficiency in these cells is very high, permitting easy detection of expressed protein by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4C, transfection of p290-myc (2Fisher P.B. Prignoli D.R. Hermo Jr., H. Weinstein I.B. Pestka S. J. Interferon Res. 1985; 5: 11-22Google Scholar, 3Graham G.M. Guarini L. Moulton T.A. Datta S. Ferrone S. Giacomini P. Kerbel R.S. Fisher P.B. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1991; 32: 382-390Google Scholar) in HEK-293 cells resulted in significant overexpression of Myc in comparison with the cells transfected with empty vector. For protection assays, HO-1 cells were transfected with p290-myc (2Fisher P.B. Prignoli D.R. Hermo Jr., H. Weinstein I.B. Pestka S. J. Interferon Res. 1985; 5: 11-22Google Scholar, 3Graham G.M. Guarini L. Moulton T.A. Datta S. Ferrone S. Giacomini P. Kerbel R.S. Fisher P.B. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1991; 32: 382-390Google Scholar), infected with Ad.hPNPaseold-35, and the growth of the cells were analyzed by colony formation assays. Overexpression of Myc provided partial but significant protection against Ad.hPNPaseold-35-mediated cell death (Fig. 4, D and E) consistent with the possibility that one pathway by which Ad.hPNPaseold-35 induces growth suppression and cell death is by down-regulation of Myc. hPNPaseold-35 is a 3′,5′-exoribonuclease, prompting us to determine whether it can directly degrade c-myc mRNA. For this analysis a C-terminal HA-tagged hPNPaseold-35-expressing construct (hPNPaseold-35-HA) was created. The authenticity of the construct was first confirmed by transfecting it into HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody detected a single protein of ∼90 kDa in size only in the hPNPaseold-35-HA-transfected cells. To check whether this construct has functional similarity to Ad.hPNPaseold-35, HO-1 cells were transfected"
https://openalex.org/W2067013689,"To investigate the coupling selectivity of G proteins and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), we developed a reconstitution system made up of GPCR and heterotrimeric G proteins on extracellular baculovirus particles (budded virus (BV)). BV released from Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus coding for human leukotriene B4 receptor (BLT1) cDNA exhibited a high level of BLT1 expression (27.3 pmol/mg of protein) and specific [3H]leukotriene B4 binding activity (Kd = 3.67 nm). The apparent low affinity of the expressed BLT1 is thought to be due to relative non-availability of the Gαi isoform, which couples to BLT1, in BV. Co-infection of heterotrimeric G protein recombinant viruses led to co-expression of BLT1 and G protein subunits on BV. A guanosine-5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate-sensitive, high affinity ligand binding was observed in the BLT1 BV co-expressing Gαi1β1γ2 (Kd = 0.17 nm). A relatively large amount of high affinity receptor protein was recovered in the co-expressing BV fraction (6.81 pmol/mg of protein). A combination of BLT1 and Gαi1 without Gβ1γ2 did not exhibit high affinity ligand binding on BV, indicating the low background environment for the GPCR-G protein coupling in this BV reconstitution system. To test other G proteins for coupling, various Gα subunits were combinatorially expressed in BV with BLT1 and Gβ1γ2. The BLT1 BV co-expressing GαoAβ1γ2 exhibited a comparably high affinity ligand binding as well as ligand-stimulated guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding to Gαi1β1γ2. Co-expression of other Gα isoforms such as Gαs, Gα11, Gα14, Gα16, Gα12, or Gα13 did not exhibit any significant effects on ligand binding affinity in this system. These results reveal that BLT1 and coupled trimeric G proteins were functionally reconstituted on BV and that Gαo as well as Gαi couples to BLT1. This expression system should prove highly useful for pharmacological characterization, biosensor chip applications, and also drug discovery directed at highly important targets of the membrane receptor proteins.

GPCRs play an important role in transmembrane signal transduction by binding extracellular ligands such as biogenic amines, peptides, hormones, lipids, and nucleotides (1Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Google Scholar). The sensing of exogenous stimuli such as light, odors, and taste is also mediated by this family of GPCRs. Ligand binding activates the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) on the intracellular face of the plasma membrane (2Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

There is a considerable interest in the investigation of newly identified GPCRs as potential therapeutic targets (6Tate C.G. Grisshammer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 426-430Google Scholar, 7Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Chambers J.K. Muir A.I. Fantom K.G. Ellis C. Murdock P.R. Herrity N.C. Stadel J.M. Br. J.

The expression of GPCRs in insect cells with recombinant baculovirus is a common technique (9Bouvier M. Menard L. Dennis M. Marullo S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 522-527Google Scholar). Sf9 cells, derived from Spodoptera frugiperda, are essentially free of endogenous GPCRs (10Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Google Scholar), providing a low background environment for ligand binding assays. Sf9 cells do endogenously contain certain classes of G proteins that couple to heterologously expressed GPCRs. However, various lines of evidence have made it clear the endogenous Gi-class G proteins exist only at low levels in Sf9 cells (11Quehenberger O. Prossnitz E.R. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19757-19760Google Scholar) receptors have been shown to increase ligand binding activity and/or GTP binding activity in Sf9 cells when co-expressed with Gi-class G proteins. Although Sf9 cells are able to support very high expression levels of exogenous genes (19Possee R.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 569-572Google Scholar), the D2 dopamine receptor expressed in Sf9 cells is largely unglycosylated (20Boundy V.A. Lu L. Molinoff P.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 784-794Google Scholar). In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor and the formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine receptor, immature and incompletely glycosylated forms of these receptors in the cell membrane fraction of Sf9 cells have also been reported (11Quehenberger O. Prossnitz E.R. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19757-19760Google Scholar, 21Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Gay B. Boulanger P. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Bouvier M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1300-1304Google Scholar) successfully recovered functional β2-adrenergic receptor from extracellular baculovirus particles by coinfection of β2-adrenergic receptor recombinant baculovirus with a baculovirus encoding the Pr55 Gag product of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In contrast with what had been expected, most of the recombinant β2-adrenergic receptor was excluded from the Gag particles and were found instead to be associated with extracellular baculovirus (BV) in a budded form. Surprisingly, the β2-adrenergic receptor expressed on the virus particles had been glycosylated and was biologically active. In addition, post-translational modifications were found upon agonist stimulation. It should be noted here that β2-adrenergic receptor is a Gs-coupling receptor (24Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Lee T.W. Gether U. Sanders-Bush E. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5109-5116Google Scholar), and Sf9 cells contain the Gs class G protein in some abundance (12Obosi L.A. Schuette D.G. Europe-Finner G.N. Beadle D.J. Hen R. King L.A. Bermudez I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 233-236Google Scholar). BLT1 is known to be the high affinity receptor for leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which is found mainly in leukocytes and has been implicated in inflammatory activity (25Serhan C.N. Haeggstrom J.Z. Leslie C.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1147-1158Google Scholar, 26Giembycz M.A. Lindsay M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 213-340Google Scholar, 27Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Arch. Biochem.

BLT1 is also reported to couple to Gi- and Gq-class G proteins (29Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar, 30Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Google Scholar) and is not involved in Gs-class G protein signaling. In a previous report, guinea pig brain membrane exhibited LTB4-specific binding (31de Brum-Fernandes A.J. Guillemette G. Borgeat P. Sirois P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 1035-1042Google Scholar). It is also reported that LTB4 binding to partially purified membrane fraction from porcine leukocytes was increased by reconstitution of Gi-class G proteins including Gαo (32Igarashi T. Yokomizo T. Tsutsumi O. Taketani Y. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 419-425Google Scholar), which is found in the brain and nervous system (33McIntire W.E. Dingus J. Wilcox M.D. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 633-640Google Scholar). Although these reports suggest that Gαo mediates LTB4 signaling, the coupling of Gαo with BLT1 has not been investigated intensively. To exploit extracellular baculovirus expression to test whether GPCR and G protein could be reconstituted on the BV, we studied the expression of human BLT1. The possible selectivity of BLT1 coupling with other classes of G proteins was also studied by means of this system. Reagents—LTB4 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). [3H]LTB4 (6016.2 GBq/mmol) and [35S]GTPγS (46.2 TBq/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Other chemicals or reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. A recombinant baculovirus expression vector pAcYMI (34Matsuura Y. Possee R.D. Overton H.A. Bishop D.H. J. Gen.

A baculovirus-expressing bovine Gγ2 (35Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. T.

Recombinant Baculovirus Construction and Sf9 Cell Culture—The cDNA for human BLT1 (29Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using a 5′ sense primer containing the BamHI site and a 3′ antisense primer containing the EcoRI site and inserted into pBlueBac4.5 and pBlueBacHis2A baculovirus expression vectors (Invitrogen). These were designated as pBB4.5-BLT1 and pBBH2A-BLT1, respectively. For pBBH2A-BLT1, the residual coding sequence between the enterokinase restriction site of the vector and the first Met of BLT1 was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers 5′-CTGTACGACGATGACGATAAGATGAACACTACATCTTCTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCAGAAGATGTAGTGTTCATCTTATCGTCATCGTCGTACAG-3′, and the resulting plasmid was designated pBBH2-BLT1. Rat Gαs cDNA (36Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nagata S. Nakamura S. Katada T. Ui M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mouse Gα11 cDNA (38Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Google Scholar) was digested with HindIII and inserted into pBlueBacIII. Rat Gα12 cDNA (39Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4425-4434Google Scholar) was digested with Bsu36I and BglII and treated with Klenow fragment to generate blunt ends. Baculovirus expression vector pAcYMI was digested with BamHI and treated with Klenow fragment. The blunt-end fragments of the vector were ligated with Gα12 cDNA. Bovine Gβ1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using a 5′ sense primer containing the SmaI and XhoI sites and a 3′ antisense primer containing the SmaI and EcoRI sites and inserted into pAcYMI at the SmaI site. The cDNAs for human GαoA, Ga13, Ga14, or Ga16 were subcloned individually into pBlueBac4.5 at the KpnI and XbaI sites. The nucleotide sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. To generate recombinant viruses, Sf9 cells were co-transfected with the vector for either the BLT1, GαoA, Ga13, Ga14, or Ga16 and Bac-N-Blue viral DNA (Invitrogen). Other vectors for the G protein subunits were cotransfected individually with BaculoGold viral DNA (BD Biosciences). All viruses were produced by homologous recombination in Sf9 cells. The recombinant baculoviruses thus obtained were plaque-purified and amplified. Sf9 cells were cultured in Grace's supplemented media (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (Invitrogen), 100 international unit/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 1-liter spinner flask at 27 °C. Cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 72–120 h. For production of the BV of baculovirus co-expressing receptor and G proteins, Sf9 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2 for each virus and harvested 72 h after infection. Viral Particle Preparation—The BV of baculovirus was isolated basically according to the method of Loisel et al. (23Loisel T.P. Ansanay H. St-Onge S. Gay B. Boulanger P. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Bouvier M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1300-1304Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C unless stated otherwise. The culture medium of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min to separate cells. Then the supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min to eliminate possible contamination with cell debris. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitates, used as BV fractions, were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline or assay buffer and stored at 4 °C until use. For preparation of the membrane fraction, the cells were resuspended in HE/PI buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (40Windh R.T. Manning D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 3-14Google Scholar). Cells were broken open by a path made with a 26-gauge needle inserted 15 times. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitates (the membrane fractions) were suspended in HE/PI buffer and stored at –20 °C until use. Sucrose Density Gradient Sedimentation—Fractionation of the BV fraction by sucrose density gradient sedimentation was performed as described by Loisel et al. (23Loisel T.P. Ansanay H. St-Onge S. Gay B. Boulanger P. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Bouvier M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1300-1304Google Scholar). Briefly, 600 μg of the BV fraction, which had been suspended in 1.2 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) was layered onto 36 ml of a linear 25–56% (w/v) sucrose gradient in TE buffer. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 90 min. Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected from the top of the tube. Then each fraction was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min. The precipitates were resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline and used for Western blot analysis. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), except that samples were not heat-treated so as to minimize aggregation. For immunoblotting, proteins expressed on BV were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) electrophoretically at 20 V overnight. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with Block Ace (Snow Brand Milk Products, Japan) at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The following antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-baculoviral glycoprotein gp64 (established in our laboratory); monoclonal mouse anti-polyhistidine (Sigma); polyclonal rabbit anti-Gαs (K-20 sc-823), anti-GαoA (K-20 sc-387), anti-Gα11 (d-17 sc-394), anti-Gα12 (S-20 sc-409), anti-Gβ (T-20 sc-378), anti-Gγ2 (A-16 sc-374), and polyclonal goat anti-Gα16 (C-18 sc-7415) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); polyclonal rabbit anti-Gαi (AS/7, PerkinElmer Life Sciences); anti-Gα13 (3A-190, Gramsch Laboratories, Schwabhausen, Germany); anti-Gα14 (3A-195, Gramsch Laboratories). Membranes were washed 4 times with TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, or anti-goat IgG as the secondary antibody. Membranes were then washed 3 times with TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with SuperSignal West Dura substrate (Pierce). Membranes were then exposed to x-ray film RX-U (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The BV or membrane fractions were adsorbed to the wells of a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate (Asahi Techno Glass, Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed and blocked with TBS, pH 7.4, containing 40% Block Ace for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody for at least 1 h, wells were washed 3 times with TBS with 0.05% Tween 20. The anti-polyhistidine antibody bound to wells was detected with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody followed by the addition of substrate (tetramethylbenzidine). The reaction was terminated by acid, and absorbances at 450 nm were quantitated using a 96-well plate reader. Ligand Binding Assay—The radiolabeled ligand binding assay was carried out in a total of 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) (29Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar, 42Masuda K. Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 79-85Google Scholar) containing the BV fraction and [3H]LTB4. To test the effect of Gpp(NH)p on [3H]LTB4 binding to the BV fractions, 0.02% (w/v) of saponin was added in the binding buffer with various amounts of Gpp(NH)p. The assay mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The incubation was terminated by filtration of the assay mixtures through GF/C glass fiber filters (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filters were washed with ∼2 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and dried, and the remaining radioactivity was measured in a Top-count microplate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The data were analyzed with the program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Receptor-promoted [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—The BV fractions (3 μg each) were resuspended in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) (43Wise A. Sheehan M. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2272-2278Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% (w/v) saponin. BV fractions were incubated with GDP and 0.3 nm [35S]GTPγS with or without 100 nm LTB4 at room temperature for 1 h. The incubation was terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filters were then washed with ∼2 ml of ice-cold assay buffer and dried, and the remaining radioactivity was measured in a Top-count microplate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The BV fraction was recovered from the culture medium of Sf9 cells infected with His-tagged BLT1 (His-BLT1) recombinant baculovirus. BLT1 expression, detected by ELISA with anti-His antibody, was seen in the BV fraction 48 h after infection with recombinant virus carrying His-BLT1 cDNA (Fig. 1a). The His-BLT1 expression reached its peak 72 h after infection. The amount of His-BLT1 in the BV fraction at 72 h was 1.4-fold higher than that of the membrane fraction from His-BLT1-infected Sf9 cells. [3H]LTB4 binding activity was also observed in both the BV and membrane fractions prepared from Sf9 cells that had been infected with His-BLT1 recombinant baculovirus (Fig. 1b). The maximum binding activity was reached at 72 h after infection, which was about 3-fold higher in the BV than the membrane fraction. No binding activity was detected in the BV or membrane fraction collected from Sf9 cells infected with wild type baculovirus. To clarify whether BLT1 is expressed on virus or cell debris, the BV fraction from the culture medium of Sf9 cells infected with BLT1 recombinant baculovirus was analyzed by ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradients. As shown in Fig. 2, His-BLT1 was found to cosediment with baculovirus glycoprotein gp64. The expression time course and properties of the sedimentation of BLT1 in culture supernatant are compatible with previously reported β2-adrenergic receptor expression on extracellular budded virus (23Loisel T.P. Ansanay H. St-Onge S. Gay B. Boulanger P. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Bouvier M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1300-1304Google Scholar). Thus, BLT1 is likewise deduced in this case to be expressed on the budded baculovirus. The affinity for the [3H]LTB4 of BLT1 expressed on BV seems to be low (Kd = 3.67 nm, Table I) compared with that of the membrane fraction of Cos-7 cells expressing BLT1 (Kd = 0.17 nm) (29Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar). This is considered to be due to the low level of the Gi-class G protein in Sf9 cells, which is needed to couple to BLT1 for high affinity binding.Table IBinding of [3H]LTB4 to BLT1 expressed on membrane and BV fractionsCoexpressed proteinsHigh affinity bindingLow affinity bindingKd (mean ± S.E.)Bmax (mean ± S.E.)Kd (mean ± S.E.)Bmax (mean ± S.E.)nMpmol/mg of proteinnMpmol/mg of proteinMembrane fractionBLT10.218 ± 0.0611.372 ± 0.4564.378 ± 0.10326.53 ± 5.772BLT1 Gαi10.099 ± 0.0043.781 ± 0.0665.834 ± 0.14912.28 ± 0.417BLT1 Gβ1γ20.202 ± 0.0272.082 ± 0.1615.540 ± 1.2902.986 ± 0.828BLT1 Gαi1β1γ20.114 ± 0.0144.887 ± 0.155NDNDBV fractionBLT10.126 ± 0.0510.638 ± 0.1303.670 ± 0.06127.34 ± 0.550BLT1 Gαi10.147 ± 0.0271.921 ± 0.1762.997 ± 0.12813.01 ± 0.623BLT1 Gβ1γ20.138 ± 0.0300.567 ± 0.0613.632 ± 0.1136.481 ± 0.252BLT1 Gαi1β1γ20.171 ± 0.0146.814 ± 0.164NDND Open table in a new tab Expression of Receptor and Heterotrimeric G Protein—To check for BLT1-G protein coupling on BV, we prepared recombinant baculoviruses containing the cDNAs encoding the His-BLT1 as well as the G protein αi1, β1, and γ2 subunits. His-BLT1 and the G protein subunits Gαi1, Gβ1, and Gγ2 were expressed on BV in various combinations. After 72 h of infection, each BV fraction was collected. The amount of expressed receptor or each subunit of G protein was assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 3). When the sample was heat-treated for SDS-PAGE, BLT1 stacked in the stacking gel and did not enter the separating gel. Therefore, we performed SDS-PAGE analysis without heat treatment. For BLT1, the deduced molecular mass from the amino acid sequence is 37.6 kDa. Using anti-His antibody immunoblotting, three bands, with apparent molecular masses of 36.6, 35.5, and 34.8 kDa, were detected in His-BLT1-expressing BV. We did not observed the bands corresponding to the dimmers of the BLT1 in this system even in the presence of G protein. The amount of receptor expression decreased with co-infection of various G protein subunits in both the membrane and BV fractions (Fig. 3a). This observation was corroborated with ELISA measurement using an anti-His antibody (Fig. 4). No immunoreactive band was detected with anti-His antibody in the wild type BV sample. Each G protein subunit expressed an apparently similar amount on BV.Fig. 4Expression levels of BLT1 on BV co-expressing G protein subunits. BV samples expressing His-tagged BLT1 with or without various G protein subunits were subjected to ELISA with an anti-His antibody (n = 4, mean ± S.D.). Samples of 3 μg of protein were used. βγ and wild type (wt) represent the BV expressing Gβ1 plus Gγ2 subunits and the budded wild type baculovirus, respectively. OD, optical density.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ligand Binding Assay of Reconstituted Receptor and G Protein—The BV fractions recovered from culture medium 72 h after infection with His-BLT1 recombinant virus displayed a dose-dependent binding for [3H]LTB4 (Fig. 5, a and b). In Scatchard plot analysis, the binding properties of [3H]LTB4 to BLT1 expressed on BV or membrane fractions contain both high and low affinity sites (Fig. 5, c and d). The Kd and Bmax values calculated from the Scatchard plot are shown in Table I. As shown in Table I, the ligand binding properties were similar in the Sf9 membrane and BV fractions expressing the receptor alone. For BV-expressed BLT1, the mean Kd and Bmax values of the high affinity binding sites were 0.13 nm and 0.64 pmol/mg of protein, and those of the low affinity sites were 3.67 nm and 27.3 pmol/mg of protein, respectively (n = 4). The His hexapeptide fused to the N terminus of the BLT1 did not affect ligand binding (data not shown). There was no significant specific [3H]LTB4 binding in the BV fraction prepared from the culture medium of Sf9 cells infected with the wild type baculovirus. To estimate the effects of G protein on agonist affinity, the Sf9 membrane and BV fractions co-expressing receptor and G proteins were used for the [3H]LTB4 binding experiments (Fig. 5). As shown in Table I, the Bmax value of the membrane fraction co-expressing with BLT1 and Gαi1 was 3.78 pmol/mg of protein, which is 2.8-fold greater than the membrane fraction expressing BLT1 alone. The co-expression of Gβ1γ2 subunits with BLT1 also increased the high affinity site by 1.5-fold in the membrane fraction. For the BV fraction, the sample coexpressing BLT1 and Gαi1 exhibited a relatively small number of high affinity binding sites (Bmax = 1.92 pmol/mg of protein). Reconstitution of the G protein heterotrimer (Gαi1β1γ2) switched almost all the entire receptor population to the high affinity state with a Kd value of 0.17 nm, increasing the Bmax value of the high affinity receptor 9.5-fold compared with the receptor expressed alone.

The effect of nitric oxide on the mRNA expression pattern of cultured rat mesangial cells was therefore investigated by RNA-arbitrarily-primed polymerase chain reaction. Employing this approach, biglycan expression turned out to be down-regulated time- and dose-dependently either by interleukin-1β-stimulated endogenous nitric oxide production or by direct application of the exogenous nitric oxide donor, diethylenetriamine nitric oxide. There was a corresponding decline in the rate of biglycan biosynthesis and in the steady state level of this proteoglycan. In vivo, in a model of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis up-regulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase mRNA was associated with reduced expression of biglycan in isolated glomeruli. Biglycan expression could be normalized, both in vitro and in vivo, by using a specific inhibitor of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase, l-N 6-(l-iminoethyl)-l-lysine dihydrochloride. Further studies showed that biglycan inhibited cell adhesion on type I collagen and fibronectin because of its binding to these substrates. More importantly, biglycan protected mesangial cells from apoptosis by decreasing caspase-3 activity, and it counteracted the proliferative effects of platelet-derived growth factor-BB. These findings indicate a signaling role of biglycan and describe a novel pathomechanism by which nitric oxide modulates the course of renal glomerular disease through regulation of biglycan expression.

Near the N-terminal end BGN carries two (or sometimes only one) chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain(s). Despite its abundance in different tissues, the precise biological role of BGN is still a matter of debate. SLRPs are primarily considered to play a role as organizers of extracellular matrices. BGN, decorin, and other members of the family of SLRPs interact with fibrillar collagens, thereby modulating fibril formation and stability (reviewed in Refs. 1Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev.

Xu T. Young M.F FASEB J. 2002; 16: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and in an osteoporosis-like phenotype (5Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S.

Res. 2002; 17: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additionally, BGN, as well as decorin, modulates adhesion of cells to matrix glycoproteins like fibronectin and thrombospondin (7Winnemöller M. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 10-17PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bidanset D.J. LeBaron R. Rosenberg L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Hook M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interactions with cell membrane components have also to be taken into account, because BGN is most abundant near the cell surface (9Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Several SLRPs were shown to form complexes with TGF-β (10Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegård D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), which in the case of decorin affects the biological activity of the cytokine (11Border W.A. Noble N.A. Yamamoto T. Harper J.R. Yamaguchi Y. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1992; 360: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 12Kolb M. Margetts P.J. Sime P.J. Gauldie J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L1327-L1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No such properties have been reported so far for BGN·TGF-β complexes (12Kolb M. Margetts P.J. Sime P.J. Gauldie J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L1327-L1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly clear that, in addition to their interaction with TGF-β, small proteoglycans are also directly involved in cell signaling (3Kresse H. Schönherr E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Decorin has been shown to interact with members of the ErbB receptor family (13Santra M. Eichstetter I. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35153-35161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which leads to the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (14De Luca A. Santra M. Baldi A. Giordano A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and growth arrest of certain tumor cells. In endothelial cells (15Schönherr E. Levkau B. Schaefer L. Kresse H. Walsh K. J. Biol.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) decorin protects against apoptosis and induces p27KIP1. BGN seems to be required for endothelial cell migration (18Kinsella M.G. Tsoi C.K. Järveläinen H.T. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 318-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It may also affect signal transduction during growth and differentiation via induction of p27KIP1 (19Weber C.K. Sommer G. Michl P. Fensterer H. Weimer M. Gansauge F. Leder G. Adler G. Gress T.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further signaling functions may be deduced from the capability of BGN to interact via its glycosaminoglycan chains with dystroglycan (20Bowe M.A. Mendis D.B. Fallon J.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). BGN has been shown to stimulate growth and differentiation of monocytic lineage cells from various lymphatic organs (21Kikuchi A. Tomoyasu H. Kido I. Takahashi K. Tanaka A. Nonaka I. Iwakami N. Kamo I. J. Neuroimmunol. 2000; 106: 78-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the normal kidney BGN is found primarily in the tubulointerstitium. The normal glomerulus contains trace amounts of BGN produced by mesangial and endothelial cells, as well as podocytes (22Schaefer L. Gröne H.J. Raslik I. Robenek H. Ugorcakova J. Budny S. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1557-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, in advanced stages of glomerulosclerosis high amounts of BGN are deposited in the mesangial matrix (23Stokes M.B. Holler S. Cui Y. Hudkins K.L. Eitner F. Fogo A. Alpers C.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Schaefer L. Raslik I. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Macakova K. Ugorcakova J. Budny S. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In obstructive nephropathy BGN becomes up-regulated, an effect that is dramatically enhanced in decorin-deficient mice. This increase is primarily because of the appearance of BGN-expressing macrophages (16Schaefer L. Macakova K. Raslik I. Micegova M. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Robenek H. Echtermeyer F.G. Grässel S. Bruckner P. Schaefer R.M. Iozzo R.V. Kresse H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1181-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest a regulatory role of BGN during the development of renal diseases (23Stokes M.B. Holler S. Cui Y. Hudkins K.L. Eitner F. Fogo A. Alpers C.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Schaefer L. Raslik I. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Macakova K. Ugorcakova J. Budny S. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide, either produced in physiological amounts by endothelial cells and macrophages or overproduced by the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS), has been shown to be an important regulatory factor in a number of inflammatory diseases (reviewed in Refs. 25Moncada S. J. R. Soc. Med. 1999; 92: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar and 26Nathan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In the kidney, NO triggers the expression of proinflammatory and protective gene products in various types of glomerulonephritis (27Pfeilschifter J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2002; 17: 347-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Pfeilschifter J. Beck K.F. Eberhardt W. Huwiler A. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 809-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Besides infiltrating cells, renal mesangial cells (MCs), exposed to inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), start to express iNOS followed by enhanced generation of NO (29Pfeilschifter J. Schwarzenbach H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). NO exerts complex regulatory actions on proliferation (30Raij L. Shultz P.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1993; 3: 1435-1441PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rupprecht H.D. Akagi Y. Keil A. Hofer G. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 70-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), adhesion (32Yao J. Schoecklmann H.O. Pröls F. Gauer S. Sterzel R.B. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 598-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and death of MCs (33Mühl H. Sandau K. Brune B. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Sandau K. Pfeilschifter J. Brune B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4938-4946PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show for the first time, using PCR-based analysis of differential mRNA expression patterns of MCs exposed to exogenously or endogenously produced NO, that BGN is an NO-regulated gene in MCs both in vitro and in vivo and that it is involved in the modulation of the extent of adhesion, proliferation, and survival of MCs. Reagents—Radiochemicals and a Recliprime DNA Labeling System were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Nylon blotting membranes were from Schleicher & Schüll or Millipore. Tissue culture plastic was from Falcon (BD Biosciences), and media and sera were from Invitrogen. The NO donors DETA-NO and SNAP, as well as the inhibitors of iNOS, l-NMMA and l-NIL, were from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany). Chemicals for reverse transcriptase-PCR were obtained from Stratagene. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Stimulation—Rat MCs were cultured as described previously (35Beck K.F. Walpen S. Eberhardt W. Pfeilschifter J. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 2945-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). They were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 5 ng/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for eight to 19 passages. To obtain quiescent cells, MCs were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 24 h prior to the addition of buffer, DETA-NO (0.063–1 mm), l-NIL (0.3–3 mm), or IL-1β (2 nm). Viability of MCs was not altered under the conditions used for the experiments, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release into the culture medium using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Analysis of the mRNA Expression Pattern in MCs by RAP-PCR—In the present work BGN was identified as a nitric oxide-regulated gene in a set of experiments performed analogously as in a previous study on NO-mediated regulation of macrophage inflammatory protein 2, using the same conditions and primers (36Walpen S. Beck K.F. Schaefer L. Raslik I. Eberhardt W. Schaefer R.M. Pfeilschifter J. FASEB J. 2001; 3: 571-573Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, mRNA from MCs was prepared using an mRNA isolation kit (Stratagene) followed by the low stringency RAP-PCR protocol provided by the manufacturer and using [α-33P]dCTP as radioactive precursor. As an internal control the reverse transcription step was performed additionally using the primer G5 that matched with the reverse strand of rat GAPDH cDNA at position 705–724 (GenBank™ accession number M17701), whereas during the PCR steps primer G3, which matched with the coding strand of rat GAPDH cDNA at position 131–150, was also present. The PCR was performed for one cycle at an annealing temperature of 35 °C and for 40 further cycles at 53 °C. The products were separated on a 4% sequencing gel. After an overnight exposition to x-ray film, bands of interest were excised, reamplified, and blunted using Pfu polymerase (Promega) according to the high stringency protocol mentioned above and sequenced. For further analysis, the PCR fragments were cloned into EcoRV sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). Nitrite Analysis—To verify endogenous NO production, nitrite as a stable end product of NO metabolism was measured routinely in culture media using the Griess reagent (Merck). Rat Model of Glomerulonephritis—The anti-Thy 1-glomerulonephritis (anti-Thy 1-GN) was induced as described before (36Walpen S. Beck K.F. Schaefer L. Raslik I. Eberhardt W. Schaefer R.M. Pfeilschifter J. FASEB J. 2001; 3: 571-573Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). l-NIL, a selective inhibitor of iNOS, was administered intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight to control and nephritic rats 45 min before and 8 h after anti-Thy 1 injection. Kidneys were harvested 16 h (n = 5 animals per group) after injection of the anti-Thy 1.1 antibody. Monitoring of systolic blood pressure and isolation of glomeruli were performed as described (36Walpen S. Beck K.F. Schaefer L. Raslik I. Eberhardt W. Schaefer R.M. Pfeilschifter J. FASEB J. 2001; 3: 571-573Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Schaefer L. Hausser H. Altenburger M. Ugorcakova J. August C. Fisher L.W. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1529-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis and In Situ Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted from isolated glomeruli using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Northern blots were performed and analyzed as described previously (37Schaefer L. Hausser H. Altenburger M. Ugorcakova J. August C. Fisher L.W. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1529-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of rat renal sections was performed in parallel with the sense and antisense probes for rat BGN (24Schaefer L. Raslik I. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Macakova K. Ugorcakova J. Budny S. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 37Schaefer L. Hausser H. Altenburger M. Ugorcakova J. August C. Fisher L.W. Schaefer R.M.

Determination of BGN in Isolated Rat Glomeruli and MC Cultures— Cell culture supernatants from stimulated (30 h) and control MCs were collected. MCs were washed three times with Hanks' solution before cell protein was extracted with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 4 m guanidinium chloride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (38Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five percent of the total volume of each cellular or glomerular extract was collected for Western blot analysis of β-tubulin and for the determination of protein content. After centrifugation, cell lysates (diluted to give 0.2 m guanidinium chloride as final concentration and made 7 m with respect to urea by adding solid substance), cell culture supernatants, and the appropriate standard solutions were loaded on 0.5 ml columns of DEAE-Trisacryl M (Invitrogen), prepared in Pasteur pipettes, and equilibrated with Buffer 1 (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 7 m urea, and protease inhibitors) and processed as described (24Schaefer L. Raslik I. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Macakova K. Ugorcakova J. Budny S. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Glomerular homogenates containing equal amounts of glomeruli were mixed with DEAE-Trisacryl M (100 mg wet weight), equilibrated with Buffer 1, and mixed by rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed sequentially with 3 ml of Buffer 1, 3 ml of urea-free Buffer 1, and 3 ml of urea-free Buffer 1 containing 0.3 m NaCl. Elution was achieved with 1.5 ml of urea-free Buffer 1 containing 1 m NaCl. Upon adding 5 volumes of methanol and 1 volume of chloroform followed by freezing on dry ice, proteoglycans were collected after thawing at the interphase between chloroform and aqueous methanol. The upper phase was removed, and proteoglycans were precipitated to the bottom of the tube by adding again 5 volumes of methanol. The proteoglycans from cell culture supernatants, MCs, or glomerular homogenates were digested with chondroitin ABC lyase (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) to remove chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate chains. BGN from plasma or urine samples was semipurified as described previously (24Schaefer L. Raslik I. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Macakova K. Ugorcakova J. Budny S. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). According to the analysis of [35S]sulfate-labeled biglycan from fibroblast secretions as an internal standard, the recovery after the ion exchange chromatography step varied by 85 ± 10%. The presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 was the critical component for achieving good recovery. Additional control experiments, yielding the expected results, were performed by adding known quantities of BGN to the culture medium prior to loading on the DEAE column. Untreated and chondroitin ABC lyase-treated samples from MCs and their culture supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (38Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma, urine, and glomerular samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 3% casein, 1% goat serum, and 0.002% Tween 20 in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl. Western and dot blot membranes were incubated with chicken anti-rat BGN (37Schaefer L. Hausser H. Altenburger M. Ugorcakova J. August C. Fisher L.W. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1529-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or with rabbit anti-mouse BGN (LF-106) antibodies (dilution 1:500 with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl/1% bovine serum albumin) for 90 min at 37 °C, whereas the second antibody, horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit (enzyme immunoassay grade; Bio-Rad) was applied for 90 min at ambient temperature. Additionally, β-tubulin content in cell extracts was quantified by Western blot analysis (rabbit anti-β-tubulin; 1:500; Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Inc.) as a control for loading. The samples were visualized by using the ECL Western blotting reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences), and analysis was performed with IQ Solutions ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Labeling of MCs and Determination of Newly Synthesized BGN—Metabolic labeling of MCs was performed either with [4,5-3H]leucine or with [35S]sulfate. Quiescent MCs were treated in the presence and absence of DETA-NO (1.0 mm) for 24 h followed by preincubation with leucine-free Weymouth medium for 1 h (7 ml/75-cm2 culture flask) and subsequently labeled with 40 μCi/ml [4,5-3H]leucine for 5 h with and without NO donor, respectively. Metabolic labeling of MCs with [35S]sulfate was performed as described for fibroblasts (38Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The culture medium was supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and made 70% saturated with (NH4)2SO4. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in Buffer 1 and processed as described above. MCs were harvested in Buffer 1 and treated identically as the culture medium samples. Because an immunoprecipitating anti-rat BGN antibody was not available, and because neither intact decorin and BGN nor their respective core proteins can reliably be separated by gel filtration, decorin was first removed by immunoprecipitation with an immobilized rabbit antibody against rat decorin (37Schaefer L. Hausser H. Altenburger M. Ugorcakova J. August C. Fisher L.W. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1529-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation, supernatants of the samples labeled with [35S]sulfate were concentrated and then fractionated on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 4 m guanidinium chloride, 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors at a flow rate of 300 μl/min. [35S]Sulfate-labeled human BGN from stably transfected 293 cells was used as a control (39Kresse H. Seidler D.G. Müller M. Breuer E. Hausser H. Roughley P.J. Schönherr E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13411-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Appropriate radioactive fractions were tested by a dot blot assay with the anti-biglycan antibody (LF-106) as described above. Biglycan was eluted at a K av value of 0.27. Supernatants of the samples labeled with [4,5-3H]leucine were purified on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (Fluka) and treated with chondroitin ABC lyase prior to SDS-PAGE (12.5% total acrylamide in the separation gel) and fluorography (38Glössl J. Beck M. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14144-14150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assessment of Adhesion, Proliferation, and Survival of Cultured MCs—For determination of cell adhesion MCs were prepared using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen). Quantitative determination of adhesion was performed by using 96-well CytoMatrix cell adhesion strips (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany) coated with fibronectin, acid-solubilized type I collagen, or bovine serum albumin, respectively. Briefly, 2 × 106 MCs/ml were seeded on the coated substrates under serum-free conditions with or without recombinant BGN (2.5–50 μg/ml) from 293 cells (39Kresse H. Seidler D.G. Müller M. Breuer E. Hausser H. Roughley P.J. Schönherr E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13411-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for 1 h. Adherent cells were fixed and stained, and the relative attachment was calculated from the absorbance at 540 nm according to the manufacturer's protocol. The percentage of non-adherent MCs cultured in the absence of BGN was taken as baseline value. Additionally, 96-well culture plates, coated as described previously (7Winnemöller M. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 10-17PubMed Google Scholar) with fibronectin peptides in concentrations equimolar to a fibronectin concentration of 10 μg/ml: F120 containing the cell-binding domain of fibronectin (FN CBD; Chemicon), F30 containing the N-terminal heparin-binding domain (FN N-term HBD; Sigma), F1977–1991 containing the C-terminal heparin-binding domain (FN C-term HBD; Sigma), or commercially coated wells with human fibronectin or type I collagen (BD Biosciences) dissolved in 7 mm acetic acid were used for the assessment of adhesion or in a solid-phase assay. The solid-phase assay was performed as described previously (40Winnemöller M. Schon P. Vischer P. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar) using [35S]sulfate- or [35S]methionine-labeled human BGN from stably transfected 293 cells (39Kresse H. Seidler D.G. Müller M. Breuer E. Hausser H. Roughley P.J. Schönherr E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13411-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (Sigma) in a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. When required, the glycosaminoglycan chains of BGN were cleaved immediately before the experiment by chondroitin ABC lyase (Seikagaku Kogyo). Data are given as means of duplicates of three independent measurements in each group. Expression of BGN on the cell surface of MCs was examined by FACS analysis using rabbit anti-human BGN (24Schaefer L. Raslik I. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Macakova K. Ugorcakova J. Budny S. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). In brief, MCs were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with or without 10 μg of BGN or BGN core protein. Thereafter, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline/1% FCS. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl phosphate-buffered saline/1% FCS, and the primary antibody (rabbit anti-human BGN; 1:200) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit; 1:200) was added for another 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently cells were washed twice and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for analysis. Cells were evaluated with a FACS-calibur flow cytometer using CellQuestPro software (BD Biosciences). For flow cytometric analysis 5 × 105 MCs were used, and all experiments were performed at least three times. Additionally, MCs were cultured for 18 h, plated on 8-well fibronectin-coated chamber slides (BD Biosciences) in the presence or absence of 10 μg of BGN, and subsequently immunostained for BGN with alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (24Schaefer L. Raslik I. Gröne H.J. Schönherr E. Macakova K. Ugorcakova J. Budny S. Schaefer R.M. Kresse H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of BGN on MC proliferation, subconfluent cells (2 × 104 MCs/well) were cultured in 96-well microtiter for 24 h under serum-free conditions in the presence or absence of recombinant BGN (2.5–25 μg/ml).

https://openalex.org/W2006075575,"Activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3) has a modular domain structure consisting of seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and four G-protein regulatory (GPR) motifs. Each GPR motif binds to the α subunit of Gi/Go (Giα > Goα) stabilizing the GDP-bound conformation of Gα and apparently competing with Gβγ for GαGDP binding. As an initial approach to identify regulatory mechanisms for AGS3-G-protein interactions, a yeast two-hybrid screen was initiated using the TPR and linker region of AGS3 as bait. This screen identified the serine/threonine kinase LKB1, which is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and polarity. Protein interaction assays in mammalian systems using transfected cells or brain lysate indicated the regulated formation of a protein complex consisting of LKB1, AGS3, and G-proteins. The interaction between AGS3 and LKB1 was also observed with orthologous proteins in Drosophila where both proteins are involved in cell polarity. LKB1 immunoprecipitates from COS7 cells transfected with LKB1 phosphorylated the GPR domains of AGS3 and the related protein LGN but not the AGS3-TPR domain. GPR domain phosphorylation was completely blocked by a consensus GPR motif peptide, and placement of a phosphate moiety within a consensus GPR motif reduced the ability of the peptide to interact with G-proteins. These data suggest that phosphorylation of GPR domains may be a general mechanism regulating the interaction of GPR-containing proteins with G-proteins. Such a mechanism may be of particular note in regard to localized signal processing in the plasma membrane involving G-protein subunits and/or intracellular functions regulated by heterotrimeric G-proteins that occur independently of a typical G-protein-coupled receptor.

Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Google Scholar). Surprisingly the activation of G-protein signaling in the functional screen was independent of nucleotide exchange on the Gα subunit suggesting unexpected mechanisms for regulating the activation state of heterotrimeric G-proteins. AGS3 interacts with G-proteins (Gi/Go) via its four G-protein regulatory (GPR) or GoLoco motifs, each of which interacts with Gα (Gi > Go) and stabilizes the GDP-bound conformation of Gα (3Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar). The GPR motif is also found in other proteins including LGN, RGS12, RGS14, Rap1GAPII, Pcp2, and G18.1b (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J.

AGS3 also contains seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) in the first half of the protein, and these domains may serve as a regulatory domain for the GPR-G-protein interaction, or they may target the protein to different microdomains within the cell (5Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Google Scholar). A similar motif structure is found in the AGS3-related protein LGN in mammals (6Mochizuki N. Cho G. Wen B. Insel P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 39-43Google Scholar, 7Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Hough C.D. Parmentier M.L. O'Kane C.J. Bryant P.J. Schweisguth F. Cell. 2001; 106: 355-366Google Scholar). A role for GPR-containing proteins and G-proteins in cell polarity is also suggested by studies in Caenorhabditis elegans (13Gotta M. Ahringer J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 297-300Google Scholar, 14Gotta M. Dong Y. Peterson Y.K. Lanier S.M. Ahringer J. Curr. Biol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). AGS3 and other accessory proteins (proteins distinct from receptors, G-proteins, and effectors) may influence receptor-mediated signaling events and/or mediate signal input to G-proteins independently of a G-protein coupled receptor. Such proteins may also serve as alternative binding partners for G-protein subunits independently of heterotrimer formation (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Google Scholar, 2Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Ma C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat.

Cell. 2002; 10: 163-173Google Scholar), and the existence of these accessory proteins suggests unexpected functional roles for G-proteins within the cell. As an initial approach to define the cellular control mechanisms for AGS3-G-protein interactions, we sought to identify binding partners for the TPR domains of AGS3. We isolated several candidate AGS3-TPR-interacting proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screen, one of which corresponded to the carboxyl-terminal 107 amino acids of LKB1, also known as serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) (16Hemminki A. Markie D. Tomlinson I. Avizienyte E. Roth S. Loukola A. Bignell G. Warren W. Aminoff M. Hoglund P. Jarvinen H. Kristo P. Pelin K. Ridanpaa M. Salovaara R. Toro T. Bodmer W. Olschwang S. Olsen A.S.

Loss of LKB1 is implicated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a rare inherited intestinal polyposis syndrome (16Hemminki A. Markie D. Tomlinson I. Avizienyte E. Roth S. Loukola A. Bignell G. Warren W.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8903-8908Google Scholar), and LKB1 is actually the mammalian counterpart of the C. elegans gene par-4, which is a member of a group of polarity-determining genes during embryogenesis in both C. elegans and Drosophila (19Watts J.L. Morton D.G. Bestman J. Kemphues K.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1467-1475Google Scholar, 20Knoblich J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 11-20Google Scholar, 21Martin S.G. St. Johnston D. Nature. 2003; 421: 379-384Google Scholar). Significantly LKB1 phosphorylates AGS3 in its GPR domain, and this was completely blocked by a consensus GPR motif peptide. Placement of a phosphate moiety within a consensus GPR motif markedly reduced the ability of the peptide to interact with G-proteins suggesting that phosphorylation of GPR motifs may be a general mechanism regulating the interaction of GPR-containing proteins with G-proteins. Such a mechanism may be of particular note in regard to the localized signal processing in the plasma membrane involving G-protein subunits and/or intracellular functions regulated by heterotrimeric G-proteins that occur independently of a typical G-protein coupled receptor. Materials—Yeast strains pretransformed with prey libraries, c-Myc monoclonal antiserum, and KC-8 chemically competent cells were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Bait vector pGBKT7 and yeast strains Y187 and AH109 were kindly provided by Dr. Tim McQuinn (Medical University of South Carolina). [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sodium orthovanadate and RNase A were obtained from Sigma. Okadaic acid was obtained from Calbiochem. pMAL-c2x and amylose-agarose beads were obtained from New England Biolabs (Boston, MA). Other materials were obtained as described elsewhere (3Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar, 7Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15897-15903Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—AGS3-TPR (Met1–Ile462) was generated by PCR. Restriction enzyme-digested PCR products were subcloned into pGBKT7 to generate the TPR bait construct. TPR and empty pGBKT7 vector were transformed into AH109 by the lithium acetate method. Expression of bait fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc. Basal activity of bait strains was assayed by nutritional selection. AH109 yeast strains expressing TPR as bait were mated with Y187 yeast strains expressing an 11-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library by following the manufacturer's protocol. The mated yeast culture was plated onto 120 quadruple dropout (Trp–Leu–His–Ade–) plates that were then incubated at 30 °C for 7 days. β-Galactosidase activity was screened using the colony-lift filter assay according to the manufacturer's directions using diploid p53/SV40 large T antigen interaction (diploid strain PJ69-2A[pVA3-1] × Y187[pTD1-1]) as a positive control as supplied by the manufacturer. Yeast plasmid DNA was isolated and used to transform competent KC-8 Escherichia coli cells. Transformants containing the prey vector were selected by plating onto M9 Leu– plates. Plasmids isolated from KC-8 transformants were transformed into XL1-Blue E. coli cells for further processing and retransformation of yeast strains. Immunoprecipitation and Cell Labeling—100-mm dishes of confluent COS7 cells were transfected with either 10 μg of empty vector (pcDNA3), 5 μg of pcDNA3::AGS3 + 5 μg of empty vector, or 5 μg of pcDNA3::AGS3 + 5 μg of pcDNA3::LKB1 (mouse). After 24 h, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and precleared with Gamma-Bind Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precleared lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated with 5 μg of anti-LKB1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 12–18hat4 °C. Gamma-Bind Sepharose was added, and incubation continued for 30 min. The resin was pelleted and used for kinase assays. Samples were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resuspended in 5× protein sample buffer, and placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with AGS3-specific (PEP32) (3Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar) and LKB-specific (P6) (22Nezu J. Oku A. Shimane M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 750-755Google Scholar) antisera. PC12 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol) according to Kang et al. (23Kang S. Liao P. Gage D.A. Esselman W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11588-11596Google Scholar) except that phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was used. For experiments with the Drosophila proteins, 3.5–7-h-old wild-type Drosophila embryos were collected, dechorionated, and lysed by Dounce homogenization in ice-cold embryo lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 27.5 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 25 mm sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The resultant lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a 4 °C bench-top centrifuge, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. Each immunoprecipitation (1:60 dilution of antisera) used lysate corresponding to 150 μl of packed embryos in a total volume of 300 μl. Immunoblots were performed with mouse anti-LKB1 (1:200) or rabbit anti-Pins (1:100). Mouse anti-Drosophila LKB1 was generated against a maltose-binding protein-LKB1 fusion protein and recognizes a single 75-kDa band in embryonic extracts. Rabbit anti-Pins was described before (11Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 183-194Google Scholar). Kinase Assay—LKB1 immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.5 μm okadaic acid) (17Sapkota G.P. Kieloch A. Lizcano J.M. Lain S. Arthur J.S. Williams M.R. Morrice N. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19469-19482Google Scholar). The Gamma-Bind Sepharose was then resuspended in kinase buffer A containing 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol) and 1 μm purified GST fusion protein. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The Gamma-Bind Sepharose beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was removed and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 24 °C to isolate the GST fusion proteins. The glutathione-Sepharose was pelleted and washed three times with kinase buffer A, resuspended in 5× protein sample buffer, and placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Although AGS3 clearly interacts with G-proteins and the GPR motifs in AGS3 and other GPR-containing proteins stabilize the GDP-bound conformation of Gα, only a subpopulation of AGS3 and G-proteins are associated with each other in brain lysates (3Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar), and the two proteins exhibit minimal overlap in terms of their subcellular distribution (5Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Google Scholar). These data suggest that the interaction between AGS3 and G-proteins is a regulated event. As part of a broader strategy to address this issue and define the role of AGS3-G-protein interactions in cellular function, we used a protein interaction screen to identify binding partners for the TPR and linker region of AGS3. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse 11-day-old embryonic cDNA library using AGS3-TPR (Met1–Ile462) as bait yielded several candidate AGS3 binding partners. The screen was run with high stringency by directly using quadruple dropout selection (Trp–Leu–His–Ade–) followed by a secondary selection for colonies that exhibited strong β-galactosidase activity within 30 min. Sixteen cDNAs were isolated, five of which encoded DNA-binding proteins or proteins involved in regulation of transcription or translation. Of the remaining 11, one cDNA clone encoded an extracellular protein, and five encoded previously unidentified proteins or proteins of unknown function. The remaining cDNA clones encoded portions of murine robo-1, an axonal guidance receptor during central nervous system development (24Kidd T. Brose K. Mitchell K.J. Fetter R.D. Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Tear G. Cell. 1998; 92: 205-215Google Scholar); microtubule/actin cross-linking factor (MACF, also known as ACF7), a member of the plakin family implicated in epithelial and neuronal polarity (25Bernier G. Mathieu M. De Repentigny Y. Vidal S.M. Kothary R. Genomics. 1996; 38: 19-29Google Scholar); MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate)-like protein, a regulator of actin dynamics, migration, and neuronal development (26Umekage T. Kato K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 147-151Google Scholar); and LKB1/STK11 (27Smith D.P. Spicer J. Smith A. Swift S. Ashworth A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1479-1485Google Scholar). LKB1 and the Drosophila AGS3/LGN ortholog Pins are both involved in various aspects of cell polarity and development. As a tertiary screen to select for proteins of potential interest, we asked whether GST fusion proteins of each of these cDNA clones interacted with full-length AGS3 in brain lysates. Only GST-MACF 2M. L. Bernard, J. B. Blumer, and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. and GST-LKB1 effectively pulled down AGS3 from rat brain lysates. We first focused our effort on LKB1 as the LKB1 ortholog in C. elegans was previously identified as a PAR (partitioning defective) gene (19Watts J.L. Morton D.G. Bestman J. Kemphues K.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1467-1475Google Scholar) involved in asymmetric division of C. elegans embryos. AGS3/LGN orthologs or proteins containing GPR motifs are also involved in similar events in Drosophila and C. elegans. The cDNA clone encoding LKB1 contained the last 107 amino acids of the coding region of LKB1. The interaction of AGS3-TPR (Met1–Ile462) with LKB1 in the yeast two-hybrid screen required amino acids Asp338–Ile462 in the AGS3 coding region that connects the TPR and GPR domains. 2M. L. Bernard, J. B. Blumer, and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. Additional regions of AGS3 and LKB1 may also interact with each other in the context of the full-length proteins. 3J. B. Blumer, Y. K. Peterson, and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. , 4AGS3 was also isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using LKB1 as bait, and both proteins were reported to be involved in astrocyte polarity (A. Hall, personal communication). We then asked whether the interaction between the carboxyl terminus of LKB1 and AGS3 was observed in a mammalian system using a GST fusion protein of the LKB1 fragment isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen. LKB1-CT (Asp330–Gln436) effectively interacted with endogenous, full-length AGS3 in rat brain lysates (Fig. 1). Interestingly this complex also contained Giα subunits, which is likely due to an interaction of G-proteins with the GPR motifs of AGS3 (3Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar). The presence of G-proteins in this complex was nucleotide-dependent in that it was not observed in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS, which is consistent with the demonstrated preference of GPR motifs for the GDP-bound conformation of Gα (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Google Scholar, 3Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J.

The interaction of AGS3 itself with LKB1 was not influenced by guanine nucleotides. The LKB1-AGS3 interaction was further addressed with the full-length proteins in the intact cell. Co-transfection of cDNAs encoding full-length AGS3 and LKB1 in COS7 cells and subsequent immunoprecipitation with LKB1 antiserum resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of AGS3 (Fig. 1B). This interaction was specific for LKB1 as immunoprecipitation with LKB1 antiserum from cells transfected with AGS3 alone did not co-immunoprecipitate AGS3 (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the results obtained with the GST-LKB1-CT (Asp330–Gln436) fusion protein in which Giα was brought down with the LKB1-CT·AGS3 complex from brain lysates, Giα was not found in the co-immunoprecipitation complex of the full-length proteins suggesting that LKB1 may process incoming signals to regulate the interaction between AGS3 and G-proteins or target the protein to a microdomain where G-proteins are inaccessible. 3J. B. Blumer, Y. K. Peterson, and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. To provide further evidence for a functional interaction between LKB1 and AGS3, we asked whether the interaction was evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila. Drosophila LKB1 (DmLKB1) co-immunoprecipitated with the AGS3 ortholog Pins, and conversely Pins co-immunoprecipitated with DmLKB1 in Drosophila embryo lysates, indicating an interaction of the full-length Drosophila proteins (Fig. 1C). In both the COS7 transfectants and the Drosophila embryos only a subpopulation of AGS3 (or Pins) was actually complexed with LKB1 following immunoprecipitation. This may reflect the affinity of the interaction, stoichiometric considerations, and/or regulation of the interaction by an as yet undefined signal(s). The AGS3 ortholog in Drosophila plays a critical role in cell polarity that apparently also involves heterotrimeric G-proteins (8Yu F. Morin X. Cai Y. Yang X. Chia W. Cell. 2000; 100: 399-409Google Scholar, 9Schaefer M. Shevchenko A. Knoblich J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 353-362Google Scholar, 10Parmentier M.L. Woods D. Greig S. Phan P.G. Radovic A. Bryant P.

Hough C.D. Parmentier M.L. O'Kane C.J. Bryant P.J. Schweisguth F. Cell. 2001; 106: 355-366Google Scholar). The LKB1 ortholog in Drosophila was also recently identified in a genetic screen for defects in oocyte and epithelial cell polarity (21Martin S.G. St. Johnston D. Nature. 2003; 421: 379-384Google Scholar). The demonstration of an interaction between LKB1 and AGS3/LGN orthologs in Drosophila provides additional evidence for functionality of this interaction and suggests a role for this interaction in the regulation of cell polarity and cell division. The 180-amino acid kinase domain (Lys44–Pro314) of LKB1 is upstream of the region interacting with AGS3 (Fig. 1). To determine whether AGS3 is phosphorylated by LKB1, we performed in vitro kinase assays using LKB1 immunoprecipitated from LKB1-transfected COS7 cells and purified GST-AGS3 fusion proteins as substrate (Fig. 2A). The region of AGS3 containing GPR motifs was specifically phosphorylated by LKB1, whereas the TPR-linker domain of AGS3 was not (Fig. 2A). The specific phosphorylation of the region of AGS3 containing the GPR motifs is of particular interest as this region of the protein serves as a potential scaffold for G-protein α subunits (3Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar). There are 24 serines/threonines in the GPR domain of AGS3, 16 of which are found in the GPR motifs themselves. All known GPR motifs contain 1–3 serines/threonines. LKB1 also phosphorylated the GPR domain found in the AGS3-related protein LGN, and this is of particular interest as both LKB1 and LGN regulate the progression of the cell cycle (7Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15897-15903Google Scholar, 29Tiainen M. Vaahtomeri K. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1497-1504Google Scholar, 30Du Q. Stukenberg P.T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1069-1075Google Scholar).3 [32P]Orthophosphate labeling experiments in PC12 cells, which express endogenous AGS3, followed by immunoprecipitation with AGS3-specific antiserum indicate that AGS3 is indeed phosphorylated (Fig. 2C). Although we do not as yet know the precise site of phosphorylation of AGS3-GPR by LKB1, the phosphorylation of the GPR domain was completely blocked by a consensus GPR peptide (Fig. 2B). The action of the GPR peptide is specific as a scrambled GPR peptide containing the same residues in a different order was ineffective (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the GPR motif is either itself the site of phosphorylation and docks within the active site of LKB1 or it is an additional anchor for protein interaction. Peptidomimetics derived from the GPR motif may actually be a path for the development of LKB1 inhibitors. As the GPR peptide effectively blocked AGS3-GPR phosphorylation by LKB1 immunoprecipitates, we asked whether phosphorylation within the GPR motif could potentially influence the interaction of AGS3 with G-proteins. We initially addressed this possibility by placing a phosphate moiety on a serine found in the core of the GPR motif. A 28-amino acid peptide encompassing the core consensus GPR motif effectively inhibits the interaction of GPR-containing proteins with Giα and also mimics the action of GPR-containing proteins by inhibiting the binding of GTPγS to G-protein (28Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L. Ma H. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33193-33196Google Scholar). This action of the GPR peptide involves discrete residues within the GPR motif (4Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Google Scholar, 31Peterson Y.K. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6767-6770Google Scholar), mutation of which leads to a loss of activity as indicated for the Q22A peptide (28Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L. Ma H. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33193-33196Google Scholar, 31Peterson Y.K. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6767-6770Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of a serine residue within the GPR motif immediately downstream of the invariant residue Gln15 markedly decreased the ability of the GPR motif to interact with Giα and to inhibit GTPγS binding to Giα (Fig. 3, A and B). LKB1 and other serine/threonine kinases may exert a regulatory influence on the interaction of G-protein α subunits with GPR motif-containing proteins by phosphorylation of residues within the GPR motif. GPR motifs are found in several proteins involved in signal propagation including LGN, RGS12, RGS14, Rap1GAP, Pcp2, and G18.1b (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Google Scholar, 4Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Google Scholar). A recent report also suggested that phosphorylation near the GPR motif of RGS14 may influence GPR-Giα interaction (32Hollinger S. Ramineni S. Hepler J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 811-819Google Scholar). Such a mechanism may allow the discrete regulation of G-protein signaling in specific subcellular compartments that occurs independently of a G-protein-coupled receptor. The localized regulation of such events is a signature mechanism for the determination of cell polarity and asymmetric cell division observed in stem cells during tissue development.

https://openalex.org/W2049277276,"To better understand the contributions that the structural maintenance of chromosome proteins (SMCs) make to condensin activity, we have tested a number of biochemical, biophysical, and DNA-associated attributes of the Smc2p-Smc4p pair from budding yeast. Smc2p and Smc4p form a stable heterodimer, the “Smc2/4 complex,” which upon analysis by sedimentation equilibrium appears to reversibly self-associate to form heterotetramers. Individually, neither Smc2p nor Smc4p hydrolyzes ATP; however, ATPase activity is recovered by equal molar mixing of both purified proteins. Hydrolysis activity is unaffected by the presence of DNA. Smc2/4 binds both linearized and circular plasmids, and the binding appears to be independent of adenylate nucleotide. High mole ratios of Smc2/4 to plasmid promote a geometric change in circular DNA that can be trapped as knots by type II topoisomerases but not as supercoils by a type I topoisomerase. Binding titration analyses reveal that two Smc2/4-DNA-bound states exist, one disrupted by and one resistant to salt challenge. Competition-displacement experiments show that Smc2/4-DNA-bound species formed at even high protein to DNA mole ratios remain reversible. Surprisingly, only linear and supercoiled DNA, not nicked-circular DNA, can completely displace Smc2/4 prebound to a labeled, nicked-circular DNA. To explain this geometry-dependent competition, we present two models of DNA binding by SMCs in which two DNA duplexes are captured within the inter-coil space of an Smc2/4 heterodimer. Based on these models, we propose a DNA displacement mechanism to explain how differences in geometry could affect the competitive potential of DNA.

Faithful segregation of the genetic material at cell division requires the regulated activities of SMC proteins and the complexes containing them. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae there are six SMC proteins, Smc1p–6p, which co-purify in pairs with either the cohesin complex (Smc1p and Smc3p), the condensin complex (Smc2p and Smc4p), or a recently described complex containing Smc5p and Smc6p (1Cobbe N. Heck M.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Losada A. Hirano T.

Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar). The SMCs comprise a ubiquitous family of proteins distinguished by the conservation of five secondary structure features. The N- and C-terminal globular domains contain, respectively, a Walker A and a Walker B nucleotide binding motif (6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar), which together make up a two-part ATP binding site. To each globular domain is connected a very long α helix of high coiled-coil probability, and both of these helices join to a central globular “hinge” (7Strunnikov A.V. Larionov V.L. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 8Saitoh N. Goldberg I.G. Wood E.R. Earnshaw W.C. J.

Conservation of the coil motifs among SMCs led to early speculation that these proteins had the potential to assemble into dimers, tetramers, or polymeric networks of even higher order (10Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Strunnikov A.V. Hogan E. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is now well established that the fundamental unit of SMC association is a dimer (12Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 13Kimura K. Hirano T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2271-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Most bacterial genomes encode a single SMC, and consequently, only homodimers are formed. All eukaryotes have at least two SMCs, and both heterodimeric and homodimeric pairs have been observed among them (15Strunnikov A.V. Jessberger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy analyses revealed that Bacillus subtilis SMC protein forms flexible V-shaped dimers, whose shape symmetry was unchanged by the addition of bulky terminal extensions (17Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), proving that SMCs form anti-parallel coiled-coils. Subsequent coil-interaction analyses of the Bacillus SMC (18Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5733-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and S. cerevisiae Smc1p and Smc3p (19Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that coiled-coils form by intramolecular pairing of helices within a single protomer and that hinge interactions alone are sufficient to stabilize the dimer. Taken together, these observations support the model of SMC dimer architecture that is depicted in Fig. 1A. The crystal structure of the Pyrococcus furiosus Rad50 (an SMC family member) N-terminal and C-terminal domains has been solved in complex with ATP (16Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Solution-phase analysis established that isolated Rad50 N and C termini form a stable heterodimeric NC domain. Two NC domains associate in the presence of ATP to form an active ATPase, and in full-length Rad50 the coiled-coils may help to bring the N and C termini of a single protomer together to form one-half of the four-part active site (20Hopfner K.P. Craig L. Moncalian G. Zinkel R.A. Usui T. Owen B.A. Karcher A. Henderson B. Bodmer J.L. McMurray C.T. Carney J.P. Petrini J.H. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Hinge-hinge interactions bring the second NC half-site into register to promote the formation of two active sites in trans and sandwich two ATP molecules within the NaCa/NbCb tetramer. Domain analysis suggests that the architecture of the heterodimeric condensin and cohesin SMCs is essentially the same as that predicted for Rad50 and their bacterial SMC counterparts (18Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5733-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). 1J. E. Stray, J. E. Lindsley, S. Gradia, and J. Berger, unpublished results. As the details of SMC structure have come into focus, speculative models of DNA binding based on their architecture have emerged as well. The “embrace” model was proposed for chromatin binding by the cohesin (19Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and depicts two chromatin 30-nm fibers, one from either sister chromatid, as bound between the coils of an Smc1/3 heterodimer. This binding mode is in part consistent with a model based on electron spectroscopic imaging of the Xenopus condensin XCAP-C/E heterodimer (Smc2/4 homologs) in complex with relaxed plasmid DNA (21Bazett-Jones D.P. Kimura K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Appreciating the resolution limits of this technique, the images appear to show the DNA duplex wrapping twice in a right-handed sense around the NC/NC globular head domains. The image-based model places two gyres of DNA, one from each encircled NC dimer, between the coiled-coils. These and other models of DNA binding await experimental validation, and few mechanistic details of DNA/chromatin binding by either the cohesin or condensin SMCs exist. To date, the Xenopus complexes are the biochemically best-characterized eukaryotic condensins (9Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 12Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M.

Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Two separable SMC-containing complexes have been purified by immuno affinity; they are the five-protein 13 S condensin of XCAP-C, -E, -D2, -G, and -H and the 8 S XCAP-C/E heterodimer. In add-back experiments only the 13 S condensin could rescue in vitro condensation of sperm chromatin in SMC-depleted egg extracts. The 13 S condensin is required for both the establishment and maintenance of chromosome condensation (9Hirano T. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and both activities require ATP and mitotic activation of the complex. Condensin-dependent changes to the geometry of plasmid DNAs were probed in topology-trapping experiments (22Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 23Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R.

Science. 1998; 282: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and two ATP-dependent activities unique to the mitotic 13 S condensin were discovered. At high mole ratios the 13 S condensin induced geometries in circular DNAs, which favored the formation of positive knots in the presence of a type II topoisomerase, and trapped positive supercoils in the presence of a type I topoisomerase (23Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The positive loop solenoid model was developed to explain how trapping of positive supercoils in relaxed circular DNA would promote positive knotting in nicked circular substrates. Moreover, these results suggested that the condensin must act to change the global writhe of a DNA substrate rather than inducing changes in DNA twist or locally wrapping DNA. The authors envisaged that the 13 S condensin preferentially traps positive loops by nonplanar bending and sequesters them into a radial solenoidal stack (23Kimura K. Rybenkov V.V. Crisona N.J. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the interaction dynamics of the Smc2/4 complex is essential if we are to correctly interpret the requirement of these proteins in chromosome condensation and segregation. This sort of analysis has been applied only to the study of the Xenopus condensin. In this paper we describe the expression, building, and testing of wild-type and mutant Smc2/4 complexes from the budding yeast and present our findings for the DNA-associated activities of this condensin SMC heterodimer pair. Yeast Stains and Plasmid Constructs—Proteins were expressed in the multiply protease deficient S. cerevisiae strain BCY123 as described (25Wasserman R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20943-20951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous deletion strains were made by targeted gene disruption in the yeast strain BY4743 (MATa/α his3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0/lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0) (26Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D.

Green E.D. Dunham I. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) using two primers specific to the 3′- and 5′-flanking regions of SMC2 or SMC4 in combination with a third primer specific for the KanMX4 gene. Tetrad dissection after sporulation of the G418r diploids confirmed that loss of either SMC was lethal (30Freeman L. Aragon-Alcaide L. Strunnikov A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 31Lavoie B.D. Hogan E. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Expression plasmids for SMC2 and SMC4 were derived from the 2-μm-based parent vectors YEpTOP2-GAL1 (32Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and pJEL236 (33Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Wild-type alleles and those bearing targeted mutations or affinity tags were fused to the PGAL1 promoter on vectors bearing different selectable markers to create the following plasmids: pJES85 (SMC2, TRP1), pJES37 (SMC2-His 6, TRP1), pJES88 (SMC2-Strep-tag, URA3), pJES72 (smc2-P, URA3), pJES103 (smc2-Sig, URA3), pJES19 (SMC4, URA3), pSJ50 (SMC4-intein/CBD, URA3), pJES46 (smc4-P-intein/CBD, URA3), and pAEH23 (smc4-Sig-intein/CBD, URA3). Alleles with disruptive mutations in the P-loop or ABC signature motif residues were named as follows: smc2-P for G36A/K37A/S38A, smc2-Sig for S1085A/G1087I, smc4-P for G190A/K191A/S192A, and smc4-Sig for S1324A/G1326I. The design of fusions based on the self-cleaving intein/CBD were described previously (33Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol.

In the Smc4-intein/CBD fusions described, a single glycine residue is left behind as the non-native C-terminal residue of Smc4p after dithiothreitol-dependent, intein-mediated cleavage. The Strep-tag II™ affinity tag consists of the eight-amino acid sequence N-WSHPQFEK-C (35Schmidt T.G. Koepke J. Frank R. Skerra A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which binds with high specificity to the biotin binding site of a streptavidin derivative (36Voss S. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) Strep-Tactin™ (IBA GmbH, Gottinger, Germany). All plasmid constructs were sequenced to verify that inadvertent mutations due to PCR or cloning were not introduced. Protein Expression and Purification—High level expression of proteins after single or double transformation of BCY123 was performed essentially as described (37Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 0.8 liters of selective medium (1.5% glycerol, 1% lactic acid) and supplemented 1 h before galactose induction with 40 ml of YENB (2% yeast extract, 4% nutrient broth). Plasmids pJES37 and pJES88 were used for individual expression of wild-type SMC2-His 6 and SMC2-Strep-tag fusions, and pJES72 and pJES103 were used for independent expression of the untagged mutant alleles smc2-P and smc2-Sig, respectively. Untagged wild-type SMC4 was expressed from pJES19, and intein/CBD fusions of SMC4, wild type, and smc4 mutants were expressed from the plasmids pSJ50, pJES46, and pAEH23, respectively. The wild-type Smc2/4 complex was routinely purified from cells expressing both SMC2 and the SMC4-intein/CBD fusion under maintenance selection for the plasmids pJES85 (Trp+) and pSJ50 (Ura+). Because it proved difficult to maintain balanced expression of smc mutant alleles, the Smc2/4 mutant complexes were assembled in vitro by co-disruption of cells expressing each protein separately. Cell harvesting and disruption were carried out as previously described (37Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following changes. Cells were washed 1× in Buffer A containing 25 mm Na-HEPES (pH 8.1), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA and then diluted at 1 g of cells/ml in Buffer B (Buffer A reduced to 0.25 mm EDTA and EGTA) and frozen at -70 °C. Cell slurry (16 ml) was thawed and spiked with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.5 μg/ml), and benzamidine (10 mm) before cell disruption. Cells were broken to ∼80% completion by glass bead lysis and diluted in 30 ml of ice-cold Buffer B plus protease inhibitors. Debris was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 0 °C, and soluble extracts were then exposed to the appropriate affinity resins as described below. Intein/CBD fusion proteins were purified essentially as described (33Morris S.K. Harkins T.T. Tennyson R.B. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3446-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) over chitin resin (New England Biolabs), washed with 10 volumes of Buffer B containing 0.25% Tween 20 and 5 volumes of Buffer B without detergent, and eluted in Buffer B plus protease inhibitors containing 40 mm dithiothreitol. Smc2-His6 was purified over nickel nitrilotriacetic-agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), washed in Buffer B, and eluted in the same buffer by imidazole challenge. Strep-tag fusion proteins were captured on Strep-Tactin resin, washed with Buffer B, and eluted by competition with 2 mm desthiobiotin. Irrespective of which affinity approach was used in the first step, the second purification step for Smc2p, Smc4p, and Smc2/4 was ion exchange over Q-Sepharose. Proteins used in ATPase assays were purified using phosphocellulose (P11, Whatman; 0.25 ml of resin/mg of protein). For proteins used in other analyses, high concentration fractions eluting from Q-Sepharose (∼2 mg/ml; 300 μl) were separated by size over a column of high resolution (Amersham Biosciences high resolution) Superose 6 (1.0 × 30 cm; exclusion limit ∼4 × 107 Da) in B:300 (Buffer B with 300 mm NaCl) running at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (4 °C). The column was calibrated in the same buffer using 20 S proteasome (1.2 MDa, a gift from the laboratory of C. P. Hill, University of Utah) in addition to thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (440 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), IgG (158 kDa), and BSA 2The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; WG topo I, topoisomerase I from raw wheat germ; kb, kilobase(s); BKS, binding, knotting, and supercoiling buffer; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino) triphosphate; TAE, Tris acetate EDTA. (67 kDa). The column void volume was established with blue dextran >2 MDa. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bradford) by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 112,430 m-1 cm-1 for Smc2/4 (38Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar)) and/or by comparison of Coomassie-stained BSA in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -70 °C. Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—Equilibrium sedimentation was performed after size separation of the wild-type Smc2/4 in buffer containing 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The inclusion of EDTA was necessary for Smc2/4 stability, and the absorbance (A 235) of this buffer was still relatively low (0.04 absorbance units). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed at 20 °C using a Beckman XL-A centrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. Sedimentation was performed at 5000, 6500, 7000, and 7500 rpm, and the data were collected at three wavelengths (360, 280, and 235 nm) as a function of radial distance by averaging 10 absorbance measurements at steps of 0.001 cm. Scans were begun 12 h after the start of the run or increase in speed, and successive scans were repeated every 4 h thereafter. Equilibrium was judged to have been reached when the overlay of UV traces from two or more successive scans showed no variation across the radial distribution. Radial absorbance data were plotted using XLGraph, 3XLGraph was written by John Philo (available at www.cauma.uthsa.edu). and the data in the optical window were selected using Xlaedit. 4Xlaedit and winNONLIN3 were written by J. Lary and D. A. Yphantis (available at www.cauma.uthsa.edu). Scans were analyzed individually and globally using the winNONLIN3 4Xlaedit and winNONLIN3 were written by J. Lary and D. A. Yphantis (available at www.cauma.uthsa.edu). version of the fitting program NONLIN (39Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Equilibrium absorbance distributions were first fit to an ideal, non-dissociating single species model in which the absorbance at a particular radial distance A r equals A r0 exp[σ(r 2 - r 02)] + Y, where A r0 is the absorbance at the reference radius r 0. The effective reduced molecular weight sigma (σ) is defined as M 1(1 - νρ)]ω2/2RT, where M 1 is the molecular weight of the smallest species, ν is the partial specific volume of the protein (ml/g), ρ is the density of the solvent (g/ml), ω is the angular velocity (radians/s), and R and T are the universal gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively. The base-line offset term Y serves as a normalization factor for A r0 values. The program SEDNTERP (version 1.01) 5SEDNTERP (version 1.01) was written by D. T. Hayes, T. M. Laue, and J. Philo (available at www.cauma.uthsa.edu). was used to derive estimates of the partial specific volume for proteins based on amino acid composition (0.7401 ml/mg for Smc2p and 0.7353 ml/mg for Smc4p) and the density of the sedimentation solvent (1.0194 g/ml) at 20 °C with data from the International Critical Tables and standard references (40Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolarions. Reinhold, New York1943Google Scholar). The equilibrium association constants obtained for fits to a reversible Smc2p plus Smc4p heterodimerization model, assuming a theoretical average monomer M r of 148,059, were high and variable, well outside a meaningful range of values, suggesting that the Smc2/4 complex behaves essentially as a non-dissociating complex. Hence, the Smc2/4 complex was treated as a monomer for all subsequent fits. Smc2/4 association and other equilibrium models were fit to the general expression A r = A r0 exp[σ(r 2 - r 02)] + A n, where the absorbance of each n-mer species, A n, equals K n A r0n exp[nσ(r 2 - r 02)] + Y, and K n is the equilibrium association constant (in absorbance units) for the formation of the nth species (second, third, fourth, etc.). The best fits were obtained using a monomer [rlhar2] dimer equilibrium model, in which the monomer molecular weight was equal to that of the Smc2/4 heterodimer. The σ value for the smallest species in association models was calculated (σcalc) using the theoretical heterodimer M r based on the sequence for Smc2/4 (296,118 g/mol), with νav = 0.7377 ml/g taken as the average of the ν estimates for Smc2p and Smc4p. Calculated association constants were converted to molar units using the equation K a = (K aAbs-1(1.2 cm × ϵ)n-1/(n) (41Senear D.F. Laue T.M. Ross J.B. Waxman E. Eaton S. Rusinova E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6179-6189Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The theoretical native molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm for Smc2p (56,730 m-1 cm-1) and Smc4p (55,700 m-1 cm-1) were converted to values appropriate for 235 nm using the 235/280 conversion ratio 4.05 to yield the Smc2/4 extinction coefficient ϵ235 = 463,442 m-1 cm-1. Base-line offset terms (Y) were floated, and σ was then globally fit to a single species model without compensatory adjustment for non-ideality. More complex models were fit globally to a common association constant by holding σcalc for the theoretical Smc2/4 heterodimeric M r and n constant. The fit was judged to be in good agreement with the model if separate K n values for each data set converged with the global K n.

Coupled assays were performed in 0.5 ml of binding, knotting, and supercoiling buffer (BKS: 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 100 μg/ml BSA, 3 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 50–5000 μm ATP, and 150 nm wild-type Smc2/4 complex (300 nm ATPase active sites) and coupling reagents phosphoenol pyruvate, NADH, and protein kinase/lactate dehydrogenase at the concentrations described (44Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For TLC assays, 25-μl reactions were performed in BKS supplemented with 100 μg/ml BSA, 3 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm ATP, 0.125 μl[α-32P]ATP (8 nm), and 300 nm wild-type or mutant Smc2/4 complex (600 nm ATP active sites). Assays done in the presence of DNA were performed at a base-pair concentration of 50 μm (167 bp per Smc2/4). Other details are found in the figure legends. DNA Substrate Preparation, Binding Reactions, and Electrophoresis—Topoisomerase I was purified from raw wheat germ (WG topo I) as described (46Dynan W.S. Jendrisak J.J. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5860-5865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at -70 °C at 400 μg/ml. The various plasmids used in analyses, pBSKS(+) (Stratagene, 2961 bp), pRS424 (47Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) (5616 bp), or pJES7 (14,700 bp), were relaxed at 23 °C with WG topo I, singly nicked in the presence of ethidium bromide with DNase I as described (48Hsieh T.S.

Circular pBSKS(+) was radioactively labeled by nick translation in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP using standard procedures. The plasmid pBSKS(+) was linearized with XmaI and end-labeled by incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP with T4 DNA polymerase. Radiolabeled DNA was quantitated by ethidium bromide staining in agarose gels by comparison to non-labeled DNA standards.

Amylases, which are glucosidic-bond-hydrolyzing enzymes, are classified into endo and exo types. The former contains α-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1), pullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41), and isoamylase (EC 3.2.1.68), whereas the latter contains exo-1,4-α-d-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.3), β-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2), exo-isomaltotriohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.95), exo-maltotetraohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.60), and exo-maltohexaohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.98). α-Amylases hydrolyze α-1,4-d-glucosidic-bonds of glycogen, starch, related polysaccharides, and some oligosaccharides. α-Amylases are found in microorganisms, animals, and plants.

The structures of these α-amylases commonly consist of three domains, a structurally conserved (β/α)8-barrel domain first observed in triose phosphate isomerase (Domain A), an additional domain inserted within Domain A (Domain B), and the C-terminal domain (Domain C) (10Banner D.W.

Furthermore, all known α-amylases, except for cyclodextrins- and pullulan-hydrolyzing α-amylases containing an additional domain (15Kamitori S. Abe A. Ohtaki A. Kaji A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Google Scholar), have a common site for the highly conserved calcium ion at the interface between two domains (A and B) to keep the functioning structure (12Nielsen J.E. Borchert T.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 253-274Google Scholar). The role of the conserved calcium ion is mainly to retain the structural rigidity of the α-amylase molecules (1Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar, 7Buisson G. Duee E. Haser R. Payan F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3909-3916Google Scholar, 9Larson S.B. Greenwood A. Cascio D. Day J. McPherson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1560-1584Google Scholar). α-Amylases are widely used for desizing textiles as well as for producing glutinous starch syrup and sugar, detergent for automatic dishwashing machines, and so on. Because detergents usually display their washing function at a pH range between 8 and 11, it is desirable for the enzymes used in detergents to be alkaliphilic (12Nielsen J.E. Borchert T.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 253-274Google Scholar, 17Ito S. Kobayashi T. Ara K. Ozaki K. Kawai S. Hatada Y. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 185-190Google Scholar). When alkaline α-amylase is used as a component of detergents, it is unfavorable that its structural rigidity depends on the calcium ions included in the α-amylase molecule because the chelating reagents usually contained in detergents easily remove calcium and zinc ions (12Nielsen J.E. Borchert T.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 253-274Google Scholar). However, known alkaline α-amylases usually contain structurally essential calcium ions and are often inhibited by chelating agents such as zeolite, EDTA, and EGTA (18Moranelli F. Yaguchi M. Calleja G.B. Nasim A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 899-908Google Scholar, 19Violet M. Meunier J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 665-670Google Scholar, 20Kim C.H. Kim Y.S. Eur. J.

This α-amylase prefers alkaline conditions and resists oxidative reagents. This enzyme hydrolyzes soluble starch, amylopectin, glycogen, amylose, and dextrin to oligosaccharides or glucose and does not hydrolyze dextran, pullulan, or α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins (23Hagihara H. Igarashi K. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Ikawa-Kitayama K. Ozaki K. Kawai S. Ito S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1744-1750Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence homology with BLA, a typical known bacterial α-amylase from B. licheniformis, is ∼63% (Fig. 1). However, it has been shown by activity measurements and elemental analysis that AmyK38 has no Ca2+ ions and is not inhibited by chelating reagents. It also appears that its enzymatic activity depends on the existence of Na+ ions (23Hagihara H. Igarashi K. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Ikawa-Kitayama K. Ozaki K. Kawai S. Ito S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1744-1750Google Scholar, 24Hagihara H. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Igarashi K. Ozawa T. Kawai S. Ozaki K. Ito S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3974-3982Google Scholar). These characteristics of AmyK38 are advantageous for the use of alkaline α-amylases as a component of detergents. We have determined the crystal structure of AmyK38 from an alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain KSM-K38 to prove crystallographically the calcium independency of this enzyme and to clarify how the structural rigidity is maintained in the absence of calcium on the basis of the three-dimensional structures of the wild-type, metal-exchanged, and mutated forms of AmyK38. Expression and Purification—The recombinant wild-type AmyK38 from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain KSM-K38 was produced and purified as described previously (23Hagihara H. Igarashi K. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Ikawa-Kitayama K. Ozaki K. Kawai S. Ito S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1744-1750Google Scholar, 24Hagihara H. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Igarashi K. Ozawa T. Kawai S. Ozaki K. Ito S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3974-3982Google Scholar). The N289H mutant of AmyK38, in which Asn-289 was replaced with His, was constructed using the method of splicing by overlap extension (25Horton R.M. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. 15. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 251-261Google Scholar). This mutation was based on the correspondence between that Asn-289 at the Na III site (see below) of wild-type AmyK38 and His-289 of BLA. Expression and purification were carried out in the same manner as with wild-type AmyK38 (23Hagihara H. Igarashi K. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Ikawa-Kitayama K. Ozaki K. Kawai S. Ito S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1744-1750Google Scholar, 24Hagihara H. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Igarashi K. Ozawa T. Kawai S. Ozaki K. Ito S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3974-3982Google Scholar). Crystallization and Preparation of the Metal-exchanged Enzymes— Protein solutions of the wild-type AmyK38 and its N289H mutant were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.5) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Both the wild-type and N289H enzymes were crystallized by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K using the reservoir solutions (pH 6.8) containing 0.085 m cacodylate-NaOH, 25.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.17 m sodium acetate, and 15% (v/v) glycerol (Crystal Screen Cryo™ number 28, Hampton Research). The wild-type enzyme was also crystallized in the presence of CaCl2 (2 mm) added to the protein solution. The mixtures of the same volume of the protein solutions and the reservoir solutions were equilibrated against the reservoir solutions. Sodium ions of the wild-type AmyK38 were replaced with rubidium, potassium, and lithium ions by the soaking method for crystals because the co-crystallization from the metal-containing solutions was not successful. The components of the soaking buffer solutions were: 0.085 m MES-NaOH, pH 6.8, 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m rubidium acetate, and 15% (v/v) glycerol for rubidium; 0.085 m MES-KOH, pH 6.8, 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m potassium acetate, and 15% (v/v) glycerol for potassium; 0.085 m MES-LiOH, pH 6.7, 25.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m lithium acetate, and 15% (v/v) glycerol for lithium. Excess volumes of these buffer solutions were added into the drops containing wild-type AmyK38 crystals for soaking. The crystals were frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K after the soaking times of 5 min, overnight, and 2 min for rubidium, potassium, and lithium, respectively. Data Collection, Phasing, and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data from the crystals of the wild-type, metal-exchanged, and N289H mutant enzyme were collected at 100 K at the BL40B2, BL44B2, and BL45PX beamlines of SPring-8. The x-ray wavelength of 0.81 Å was selected in the data collection for Rb+-containing crystals to observe the large anomalous dispersion effect as the K absorption edge of rubidium is 0.8155 Å. These data were processed by the programs of the HKL2000 suite (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular replacement method for the wild-type AmyK38 was carried out using the atomic coordinates of BLA (Protein Data Bank accession code 1bli) as a search model by the program AMoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) from the CCP4 program suite (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The refined structure of the wild-type AmyK38 was used as the search model in the molecular replacement method of other data sets of the N289H mutant and metal-exchanged enzymes. All of the structures were refined by the programs O and CNS (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar, 30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Replacements of Na+ ions by Rb+, K+, or Li+ ions were assessed by electron density maps, anomalous difference Fourier maps and coordinates, and B-factors of refined structures. In the present study, we determined the crystal structures of five crystal forms of AmyK38, the wild-type enzyme, three metal-exchanged enzymes with rubidium, potassium, and lithium, and the N289H mutated enzyme. Crystallization, Data Collection, Molecular Replacement, and Structure Refinement—The quadrilateral bipyramidal-shaped crystals grew in ∼2 weeks to an approximate size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm. The crystals were found to belong to the cubic space group P23 (a = 132.1 Å for the wild-type crystal) and to diffracted X-rays beyond 2.2-Å resolution. Statistics for data collection and structure refinement are shown in Table I. The molecular replacement method was successfully performed for all crystals. The structure of the wild-type AmyK38 was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 19.9% (R-free of 23.2%) at 2.13-Å resolution. Root mean square deviations from ideal bond distances and angles were 0.006 Å and 1.3°, respectively (31Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Google Scholar). In a Ramachandran plot, 87.6% of the non-glycine residues were in the most favored regions of a ϕ-ψ plot (32Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Google Scholar). The structure refinement of the wild-type crystals grown from the CaCl2-containing solution afforded R-factor of 19.4% and R-free factor of 22.2%. The structures of the metal-exchanged enzymes were also refined at 2.50–2.88-Å resolution to R-factors between 21.0 and 22.4% (R-free factors between 25.1 and 27.2%).

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of the Wild-type AmyK38 —The overall structure of the wild-type AmyK38 is shown in Fig. 2. The folding of the wild-type AmyK38 is essentially similar to that of BLA, with root mean square deviations of 0.90 Å for the main chain atoms of the common 473 amino acid residues. The AmyK38 molecule consists of three domains (A, B, and C) containing a (β/α)8-barrel motif (Domain A) commonly observed in various glycosidases (Fig. 2). In addition to the protein molecule, three significant peaks were observed in the electron density map of the wild-type AmyK38 (assigned to sites I, II, and III). The peak heights in the solvent-omit Fo – Fc map (11.0σ, 9.5σ, and 12.3σ for the sites I, II, and III, respectively), which are only slightly larger than those of the most well identified water oxygen (9.0σ), are too small to assign to the calcium ions. Two of these (sites I and II), surrounded by one carboxyl group of an aspartic acid residue, amido groups of asparagine residues, carbonyl oxygen atoms of the main chain, and a few water molecules, are located at the sites corresponding to the Ca2+ ions (Ca I and Ca III) in the BLA structure (Fig. 3, a and b). These ions are hexacoordinated, and the geometry is described as a distorted quadrilateral bipyramidal octahedron (Fig. 3, a and b), which is often observed in the metal ion binding sites of metalloproteins. The third site (site III) is observed only in the wild-type AmyK38 structure and is occupied by the side chain of a histidine residue in the BLA structure (Fig. 3c). The structure of the wild-type AmyK38 was determined using two types of crystals grown from the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-containing (2 mm) crystallization solutions (Table I). However, no significant differences of electron density between these two crystal structures were observed in these metal binding sites (Table II). In addition, it has already been shown that the enzymatic activity of AmyK38 depends on Na+ ions (not on Ca2+ ions) (23Hagihara H. Igarashi K. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Ikawa-Kitayama K. Ozaki K. Kawai S. Ito S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1744-1750Google Scholar, 24Hagihara H. Hayashi Y. Endo K. Igarashi K. Ozawa T. Kawai S. Ozaki K. Ito S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3974-3982Google Scholar). The peak heights of the electron density at three positions are also the most reasonable to be assigned to the sodium ions. These observations imply that the wild-type AmyK38 contains not Ca2+ ions but Na+ ions, at the three positions mentioned above, a hypothesis that was confirmed by the subsequent metal-exchange experiments.Table IIPeak heights and B-factors of the metal ions and bond distances between the metal ions and the ligand oxygen atomsCrystalWild-type (Ca-free)aGrown from calcium-free solutions.Wild-type (CaCl2)bGrown from 2 mM CaCl2-containing solutions.Rb+ soakingcSoaked into Rb+ containing solutions.

Open table in a new tab Asp-161, Asp-183, Asp-200, and Asp-204 around the calcium-sodium-calcium triad containing the highly conserved Ca I in BLA (1Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar) are replaced with Asn-161, Asn-183, Asn-200, and Ser-204 at the corresponding site around site I of AmyK38, respectively (Fig. 3a). Asp-430 at the Ca III site of BLA is replaced with Asn-427 at site II of AmyK38 (Fig. 3b). These replacements of amino acid residues reduce the negative charges of the cation binding sites and induce binding a monovalent metal ion such as Na+ rather than a divalent metal ion such as Ca2+ to these sites. A similar exchange of metal ions has been reported in the cyclodextrin- and pullulan-hydrolyzing α-amylases, TVA I and TVA II (15Kamitori S. Abe A. Ohtaki A. Kaji A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 443-453Google Scholar, 16Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Google Scholar). Although TVA I and TVA II also contain Ca2+ ions, these ions are not highly conserved among α-amylases. The amino group Nζ of Lys-295 in TVA II, corresponding to Asp-200 in BLA, occupies the site of the highly conserved Ca2+ ion (16Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Google Scholar). The replacement of negatively charged amino acid residues with neutral or positively charged residues might be a common way to change or remove metal ions from α-amylases and other metalloproteins by site-directed mutagenesis. Crystallographic Evidence for the Existence of the Monovalent Metal Ions in AmyK38 —As already mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that the three metal ions found in AmyK38 are not assigned to calcium, but to sodium, from several reasons, including the peak heights in the electron density map (Fig. 3, a–c). To obtain crystallographic evidence for the replacement of divalent Ca2+ with monovalent Na+ ions, the crystal structures of the metal-exchanged AmyK38 (to Rb+, K+, and Li+) were determined. In the crystal of the Rb+-exchanged AmyK38 prepared by the soaking method in the Rb+-containing buffer, the structure showed that sites I and II were not replaced with Rb+, but that site III was replaced with Rb+. A significant peak (over 18 σ) was observed at site III in the anomalous Fourier map (amplitude, F(+) – F(–); phase, Fcalc+90 degrees) with the results indicating that site III was replaced with Rb+ ions. In addition, three significant anomalous Fourier peaks (over 10 σ) were also found on the surface of the AmyK38 molecule, and these were refined as Rb+ ions. In the native AmyK38 structure, no metal ions are observed at the corresponding Rb+ positions on the surface of AmyK38. The replacement with Rb+ at site III provides evidence that site III is exchangeable by a monovalent metal ion such as Na+. Therefore, it is most likely that site III contains a Na+ ion in native AmyK38. Sites I and II may not be replaced with Rb+ ions due to the large ion radius of Rb+. A similar observation has also been reported for the sodium binding site of BLA (1Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar). Moreover, sites I and II correspond to the sites for the Ca I and Ca III of BLA (Fig. 3, a and b). This result also suggests that the binding affinity of site III for monovalent metal ions is weak. In the K+-exchanged AmyK38 prepared by the soaking method in the K+-containing buffer, no large differences were observed in the electron density of the crystal structure (Table II). However, B-factors of atoms at sites II and III refined as Na+ ions were obviously decreased from 20.0 and 14.3 Å2 (the native AmyK38) to 9.0 and 1.0 Å2 (the K+-containing AmyK38 refined as Na+ ions), respectively (Table II). B-factors of atoms at sites II and III refined as K+ ions were converged to 29.0 and 18.9 Å2, respectively (Table II). In comparison with B-factors of surrounding residues, these values at sites II and III refined as K+ ions are reasonable (Table II). On the other hand, the peak height of site I is similar to that of the native AmyK38, and the B-factor of the atom at site I refined as a Na+ ion was increased from 12.9 Å2 (the native AmyK38) to 18.5 Å2 (the K+-containing AmyK38) (Table II). Moreover, coordination distances between these three metal peaks and surrounding residues are slightly lengthened (Table II). We therefore conclude that the metal ions at sites II and III were partially or fully replaced with K+ ions and that the metal ion at site I may have been partially replaced with a K+ ion. Therefore, these results also support the hypothesis that the metal ions at sites I, II, and III tend to be replaced with monovalent metal ions and that the metal ions in native AmyK38 are assigned to Na+ ions. In the Li+-exchanged AmyK38 prepared by the soaking method in the Li+-containing buffer, significant differences were observed in the electron density of the crystal structure. At site I, the electron density of the metal ion was obviously decreased, indicating that the electron density could be assigned to Li+ (Table II). The electron density of the water molecule coordinated to the metal ion had disappeared in the Li+-exchanged AmyK38, and the coordination geometry around the metal ion was consequently changed. At the same time, the electron densities at sites II and III were also obviously decreased. These findings indicate that sites I, II, and III were almost fully replaced with Li+ ions. It is therefore concluded that sites I, II, and III are replaceable with monovalent metal ions and can be assigned as Na+ ions in the native AmyK38. The coordination geometry and the electron density in the structure of the K+- and Li+-exchanged AmyK38 show that the binding of the Na+ ion at site I is tight, as compared with that at sites II and III. Moreover, this result is in accord with the correspondence between site I and the highly conserved Ca2+ ion binding site reported in almost all α-amylases (Fig. 3a). These ion-exchange experiments show that sites I, II, and III are certainly Na+ ion binding sites (Na I, Na II, and Na III, respectively) and that Na I is bound more tightly than Na II and is the most important to the AmyK38 structure. In addition, Na III, which is surrounded by only four atoms, Oδ1 or Nδ2 of the amido group of Asn-289, Oδ1 of the carboxyl group of Asp-325, the carbonyl oxygen atom of Val-324, and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ser-337, is loosely bound (Fig. 3c). The structure of N289H mutant AmyK38 was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 23.4% in the resolution range between 100 and 2.15 Å (Table I) to investigate the role of site III. In this mutant, where Asn-289 is replaced by histidine, a corresponding residue in BLA, the metal ion at site III has disappeared, with the position being occupied by the side chain of His-289 (Fig. 3d). Consequently, the arrangement of amino acid residues at site III is almost identical to that of BLA, as shown in Fig. 3d. The activity measurements show that this mutation hardly affects the specific activity and affords only 10% decrease of the sodium ion dependence (Fig. 4). The site III is far from the catalytic residues and not conserved in other α-amylases. These results show that the Na III is dispensable to retain the structure and function of AmyK38. Conclusion—Neither the highly conserved Ca2+ ion nor any other Ca2+ ion exists in AmyK38. However, there are three Na+ ions at Na I, Na II, and Na III sites in the AmyK38 molecule. These ions are located far from the catalytic residues of AmyK38 and probably do not affect the catalytic mechanism. Two of the three ions located at Na I and Na II sites correspond to Ca2+ ions observed in other α-amylase structures. In particular, the Na+ ion at the Na I site corresponds to the highly conserved Ca2+ ion in almost all α-amylases. It has been reported that residues 178–199, which are disordered in apo-BLA, are dynamically moved and ordered by the binding of metal ions, including the highly conserved Ca2+ ion in holo BLA (1Machius M. Declerck N. Huber R. Wiegand G. Structure. 1998; 6: 281-292Google Scholar). Some of these ordered residues form parts of sugar subsites. Therefore, Na+ ions at Na I and Na II sites must be important to retain the functioning structure of the AmyK38 molecule, which is free from any calcium ions. Recently, α-amylase from Pyrococcus furiosus, which had been initially reported as the case of calcium-free α-amylase (33Dong G. Vieille C. Savchenko A. Zeikus J.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3569-3576Google Scholar), was indicated to be a calcium- and zinc-containing enzyme (14Savchenko A. Vieille C. Kang S. Zeikus J.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6193-6201Google Scholar). AmyK38 is the first case in which the structure of the α-amylase has no Ca2+ ions and in which the Na+ ions instead of Ca2+ play an important role in retaining the structure of the α-amylase. Such metal substitutions occur by the charge-changing replacements of metal ions surrounding the residues. This amylase could be employed as a component of detergents used industrially, and this finding could prove useful with regard to developing further applications for α-amylases and to the protein engineering of metalloproteins.

In insects, ecdysteroids, which regulate development and reproduction, are synthesized in prothoracic glands. However, in many insect species, ecdysteroids have been demonstrated to be synthesized in ovaries as well, to accumulate in mature ovaries, and to be transferred to eggs (1Hoffmann J.A. Lagueux M.

Most of these ecdysteroids are physiologically inactive phosphoric esters and synthesized by the enzyme, ATP:ecdysteroid-phosphotransferase (ecdysteroid kinase), which catalyzes phosphorylation of ecdysteroids (Fig. 1) (4Kabbouh M Rees H.H.

It has been suggested that free ecdysteroids are liberated from maternal ecdysteroid-phosphates during embryonic development and participate in the secretion of serosal cuticle and/or the induction of embryonic cuticulogenesis (embryonic molt) in various insects, such as Locusta migratoria (6Lagueux M.

Furthermore, 20E was demonstrated to be formed by de novo synthesis (16Sonobe H. Tokushige H. Makka T. Tsutsumi H. Hara N. Fujimoto Y. Zool.

Sonobe H. Zool. Sci. 2000; 17: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the potential role of ecdysteroid-phosphates as a “reservoir” of active ecdysteroids has been suggested in various insect eggs as mentioned above, little or no attention has been paid to the enzyme catalyzing the dephosphorylation, ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphohydrolase (ecdysteroid-phosphate phosphatase (EPPase)) (Fig. 1). We now report the purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of EPPase from B. mori eggs. This is the first report of a novel phosphatase that specifically hydrolyzes ecdysteroid-phosphates. Animals—Moths of the silkworm B. mori that had been destined to produce diapause eggs, the commercially available bivoltine race (kinsyu×showa), were used as the source of eggs. In diapause eggs, embryos ceased development at the late gastrula stage (48–72 h after oviposition) (14Sonobe H. Maotani K. Nakajima H. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 215-220Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Sonobe H. Odake H. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1986; 195: 229-235Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The diapause nature of the eggs was artificially changed to a nondiapause nature by the following treatments: (i) To avoid diapause initiation, prospective diapause eggs were soaked in HCl solution (specific gravity, 1.11 at 15 °C) 20 h after oviposition (15Sonobe H. Odake H. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1986; 195: 229-235Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). (ii) To obtain female moths destined to produce nondiapause eggs, the subesophageal ganglion, the source of diapause hormone, was removed soon after larval-pupal ecdysis (15Sonobe H. Odake H. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1986; 195: 229-235Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In both cases, the nondiapause eggs obtained continued to develop and larvae hatched 10 days after oviposition. For enzyme purification, HCl-treated 3-day-old nondiapause eggs were used. For RNA extraction, nondiapause eggs laid by the moths with the subesophageal ganglion removed were used, because ommochromes, which disturb first strand cDNA synthesis, are not synthesized in the nondiapause eggs. Enzyme Assay—The EPPase activity was measured using E22P as the substrate. E22P was synthesized chemically (19Yamada R. Sonobe M. Tatara A. Fujimoto Y. Sonobe H. Keller R. Dircksen H. Sedlmeier D. Vaudry H. Conference of European Comparative Endocrinologists. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy2002: 179-183Google Scholar). The amount of ecdysone (E) converted from E22P was quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using antiserum N-6 (provided by Dr. A. Mizoguchi, Nagoya University) generated against 20E-6-carboxy methyloxime hapten. This antiserum exhibited over 4,000-fold stronger reactivity against E than against E22P (19Yamada R. Sonobe M. Tatara A. Fujimoto Y. Sonobe H. Keller R. Dircksen H. Sedlmeier D. Vaudry H. Conference of European Comparative Endocrinologists. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy2002: 179-183Google Scholar). Therefore, the amount of E in the reaction mixture was quantified by RIA without isolating E from E22P. RIA was conducted as described previously (20Sonobe H. Kamba M. Ohta K. Ikeda M. Naya Y. Experientia. 1991; 47: 948-952Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the measurement of EPPase activity, the reaction mixture was made up to a final volume of 100 μl with 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 nm E22P, and 50 μl of the enzyme solution. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme solution, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of methanol, and the mixture was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 30 min to precipitate the protein. Aliquots of the supernatant were dried using a centrifugal evaporator. The residue was dissolved in 50 mm borate buffer, pH 8.4, for use in RIA. Acid phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP), which is generally used as the substrate of phosphatase (21Lowry O.H. Roberts N.R. Wu M.-L. Hixon W.S. Crawford E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 207: 19-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5010-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23Attwood P.V.

The assay mixture containing 10 mm pNPP and 200 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0, was incubated with 50 μl of the enzyme solution at 37 °C for 15 min. After the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1 m NaOH, the absorbance of p-nitrophenol (pNP) formed was measured at 405 nm. Protein Assay—The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of Subcellular Fraction—All of the procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Subcellular fractionation was performed by differential centrifugation according to previous studies (17Horike N. Sonobe H. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 41: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Chino H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 102: 400-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Three-day-old nondiapause eggs (1.0 g) were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (2 ml), pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove the chorion. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. A lipid layer obtained from centrifugation at 1,000 × g was collected and homogenized to an emulsion. Each pellet (1,000 × g pellet, 10,000 × g pellet, and 100,000 × g pellet), the lipid layer, and the final supernatant were used for the enzyme assay. Purification of EPPase—All of the purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Three-day-old nondiapause eggs (350 g) were used for enzyme purification. The eggs were homogenized in 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin/g of eggs. An aliquot of 10,000 × g supernatant was loaded onto a Q Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Elution was performed using a linear gradient of 0 to 400 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 200 min at a flow rate of 6.5 ml/min. The active fraction was applied to a Chelating Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences), which was previously charged with Zn2+ by passing 0.1 m ZnCl2 through the column and then equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl. Stepwise elution was performed using 50 mm EDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The active fractions were collected, and NaCl was added to obtain a final concentration of 1.5 m for the following purification step. This enzyme solution was applied to a Phenyl Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 m NaCl. Elution was performed using decreasing NaCl concentration at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. The active fraction was concentrated to about 10-fold, and the buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm MnCl2,1mm MgCl2,and1mm CaCl2 using Centriplus 30 (Millipore). The enzyme solution was applied to a HiTrap ConA HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer as the enzyme solution. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of the equilibration buffer, and then elution was performed using 0.5 m methyl-α-d-glucoside in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The active fraction was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Elution was performed using a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 120 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The active fraction was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and reapplied to the Mono Q column. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl for 240 min. The active fraction was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The enzyme was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Kinetic Analysis—Besides E22P, other ecdysteroid-phosphates, 20E22P, 2-deoxyecdysone 22-phosphate (2dE22P) and 22-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone 3-phosphate (22d20E3P), which were isolated from mature ovaries of B. mori (27Ohnishi E. Hiramoto M. Fujimoto Y. Kakinuma K. Ikekawa N. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 95-101Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Kamba M. Mamiya Y. Sonobe H. Fujimoto Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 395-402Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), were also used as substrates for the kinetic study of EPPase. Substrate concentration was varied from 0.4 to 204.8 μm. Amounts of the products 20E and 2-deoxyecdysone formed in the reaction mixture were determined by RIA using antiserum N-6 as described in the previous section; this antiserum scarcely cross-reacted to their phosphoric esters (<0.058% in 20E22P and <0.019% in 2dE22P). 2R. Yamada and H. Sonobe, unpublished data. The amount of 22-deoxy-20-hydroxyecdysone (22d20E) converted from 22d20E3P was determined by RIA using antiserum H-22 (provided by Prof. L. I. Gilbert, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) without isolating 22d20E from 22d20E3P; cross-reactivity of 22d20E3P to this antiserum was below 0.5% of that of 22d20E. 2R. Yamada and H. Sonobe, unpublished data. Michaelis-Menten constants (K m and V max) were graphically determined for each substrate from the Lineweaver-Burk plots. The turnover number (k cat) was calculated on the basis of molecular mass estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein Sequencing—To obtain the internal amino acid sequence of EPPase, 1 nmol of reduced and S-calboxymethylated purified EPPase was digested with trypsin (sequencing grade; Sigma). The resulting tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a CAPCELL PAK C18 UG300 (2.0 × 250 mm; Shiseido Fine Chemicals). Among the tryptic peptides, six peptides, named peptides 1–6, were sequenced by Edman degradation using an automated pulsed liquid phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 476A). cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—To clone the EPPase-cDNA fragment encoding peptides between peptides 1 and 5, a reverse transcription PCR was performed using degenerate primers. The forward primer was designed based on a part of the amino acid sequence of peptide 1 (EPP 1F, 5′-CA(A/G) GGI (C/T)TI CC(A/C/G/T) ATG AA(C/T) TGG, where I represents inosine). The reverse primer was designed based on a part of the amino acid sequence of peptide 5 (EPP 5R, 5′-(A/G)AA (C/T)TC (A/G)TC CAT (A/C/G/T)GT (C/T)TC (A/C/G/T)GC). For RNA extraction, the eggs were frozen in liquid N2 at appropriate stages of embryonic development. Total RNA was extracted using Isogen (Nippongene) from 3-day-old nondiapause eggs according to the manufacturer's protocol. The first strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA using a Ready-To-Go T-primed first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) with the Not I d(T) primer (5′-AAC TGG AAG AAT TCG CGG CCG CAG GAA T18). The synthesized first strand cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification with two degenerate primers: EPP 1F and EPP 5R. The PCR protocol was as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the objective product was purified using a Prep-A-Gene DNA Purification kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified PCR product was cloned into a pSTBlue-1 Acceptor vector (TaKaRa) by TA cloning. Transformation was screened by colony PCR using T7 and SP6 primers (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG and 5′-CAT ACG ATT TAG GTG ACA CTA TAG, respectively). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy termination method using a BcaBEST dideoxy Sequencing kit (TaKaRa). Rapid Amplification of 3′- and 5′-Ends—To obtain the 3′-end of the cDNA, the first strand cDNA synthesized as described above was used as a template for 30 cycles of the PCR amplification with a gene specific primer, GSP 1F (5′-CCC TGG GTG CCG CAC TGC TT) and an adopter primer (5′-AAC TGG AAG AAT TCG CGG), which is included in the Not I d(T) primer. The PCR protocol was as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were used as templates for the seminested PCR, which was carried out with a gene-specific primer GSP 2NF (5′-GTC GAC ATG ACT TAC AAA CCG) and an adopter primer under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min; 20 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle 72 °C for 10 min. To obtain the 5′-end of the cDNA, the first strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two rounds of the PCR amplification performed using gene-specific primers GSP 3R and GSP 4NR (GSP 3R was 5′-CCC TCC TTT ACC ACC GGC TCT GTG CGC C, and GSP 4NR was 5′-CCC AAC GAC GCG ATT TTG AAG TAC CGT TCG) together with an anchor primer supplied by the manufacturer. The conditions for each cycle of the PCR were set according to the manufacturer's protocol. Construction of cDNA Containing an Open Reading Frame—The cDNA containing the whole open reading frame of EPPase was amplified by the PCR from the first strand cDNA synthesized as described above. PCR was carried out using gene-specific primers (ORF F was 5′-ATA GGA TCC ATG GCC GGG ACA TAT CCT CAC, and ORF R was 5′-ACA AAG CTT TTA TTT TAT TAG TAT TCT CCA GTC G) under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min; and 1 cycle 72 °C for 10 min. The ORF F and ORF R primers were designed to incorporate BamHI and HindIII sites (underlined in the primer sequence), respectively. The PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into a pSTBlue-1 Acceptor vector. Five independent clones were sequenced. Baculovirus Expression—Recombinant baculovirus harboring the EPPase-cDNA was constructed using the BAC-TO-BAC baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA containing the whole open reading frame was cut with BamHI and HindIII from the plasmid as described above and ligated into the pFASTBAC plasmid. The recombinant plasmid was transformed in DH10BAC cells. The colonies containing recombinant bacmid DNA were selected by disruption of the lacZ′ gene and confirmed by colony PCR using a M13/pUC amplification primer (the forward primer was 5′-CCC AGT CAC GAC GTT GTA AAA CG, and the reverse primer was 5′-AGC GGA TAA CAA TTT CAC ACA GG). Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) were cultured in Sf900SFM (Invitrogen). The isolated recombinant bacmid DNA (1 μg) was transfected to 1 × 106 cells using a Cell-Fectin reagent (Invitrogen). The recombinant virus was harvested from the cell culture medium 72 h after transfection. For protein expression, the recombinant virus was infected to Sf9 cells at multiplicity of infection of 10. The cells were collected every 24 h after infection and homogenized in 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin/g of cells. The homogenate was used for assaying EPPase activity. Purification of Recombinant EPPase—Cells infected with recombinant baculovirus at multiplicity of infection of 10 were collected at 72 h by centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min) and homogenized in 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin/g of cells. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Q HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Elution was performed by a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 90 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The active fraction was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and applied to a Mono Q HR column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was performed using a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 120 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The active fraction was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200HR column. EPPase was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). The effluent was monitored at 280 nm. Western Blot Analysis—Polyclonal antibodies against EPPase were raised in rabbits using the purified recombinant EPPase as an antigen. Antiserum from an immunized rabbit was purified using a HiTrap Protein A column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant EPPase (1 μg) and native EPPase (1 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was preincubated for 30 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer saline containing 0.1% casein and then incubated with anti-EPPase antibodies (1:5000 dilution) for 1 h at 25 °C. Bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:5000 dilution; Wako Chemical), and the peroxidase activity was visualized using 0.5% of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer saline containing 0.02% H2O2. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from various tissues was isolated using Isogen. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on a 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and the separated products were transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with a probe corresponding to the whole open reading frame of the EPPase. The probe was labeled with alkaline phosphatase using the ALKPhos Direct Labeling Module (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out using ALKPhos Direct Hybridization Buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 55 °C. The blot was washed at 55 °C with 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 m urea, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2, and alkaline phosphatase-labeled bands were visualized using the CDP-Star Detection Reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as the substrate. Biochemical Characterization of EPPase—To elucidate the subcellular localization of EPPase, the homogenate prepared from 3-day-old nondiapause eggs was fractionated by differential centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2A, most of the EPPase activity was localized in the 100,000 × g supernatant, suggesting that EPPase is a soluble enzyme. Acid phosphatase, a typical marker enzyme of lysosomes, was predominantly distributed in the 10,000 × g pellet. The optimal pH levels of EPPase and acid phosphatase were 7.5 and 4.0, respectively (Fig. 2B). Fluoride and l-tartarate, which are strong inhibitors of lysosomal acid phosphatase (29Lawrence G.L. Van Etten R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Taga E.W. Van Etten R.L. Arch. Biochem.

Insect Biochem. 1983; 13: 411-419Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), scarcely affected the EPPase activity, although these chemicals also inhibited acid phosphatase in B. mori eggs (Fig. 2C). All of the results obtained indicate that EPPase apparently differs from lysosomal acid phosphatase. Purification of EPPase—The 10,000 × g supernatant prepared from 3-day-old nondiapause eggs was applied to a Q Sepharose HP column. Two peaks of the EPPase activity were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (Fig. 3A). The major peak, eluted within the concentration range from 170 to 200 mm (fractions 146–158), was subjected to zinc-charged Chelating Sepharose column chromatography. Most of the EPPase activity was eluted when 50 mm EDTA was added to the equilibration buffer (Fig. 3B). The active fractions (fractions 44–49) were pooled and applied to a Phenyl Sepharose column. Most of the EPPase activity was eluted with decreasing NaCl concentration (Fig. 3C). The active fractions (fractions 46–52) were pooled and applied to a HiTrap ConA column. EPPase was not bound to the matrix (elution profile not shown), but about 67% of the contaminating proteins were removed at this step (Table I). The active fraction from the HiTrap ConA column was subjected to Mono Q column chromatography twice. In the first Mono Q column chromatography, the EPPase activity with a small shoulder peak was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl. The major active fractions (fractions 34–37) were pooled and resubjected to Mono Q column chromatography (Fig. 3E). The active fractions from the second Mono Q column chromatography (fractions 67–70) were pooled and subjected to gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200HR column, the EPPase activity was eluted as a single and symmetrical peak, and the peak corresponded to that monitored at 280 nm (Fig. 3F). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the protein obtained is a single protein with a molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig. 3F, inset).Table ISummary of the purification of EPPaseStepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgpmol/minpmol/min/mg protein%-fold10,000 × g supernatant99615.0140480.141001Q Sepharose1426.096306.7569.048Chelating Sepharose147.0687046.7149.0334Phenyl Sepharose34.55700165.240.01180ConA Sepharose11.43280287.723.02055Mono Q (first)1.29590457.44.23267Mono Q (second)0.53aEstimated by A 280 with BSA as a standard.220415.11.62965Superdex 200 HR0.42aEstimated by A 280 with BSA as a standard.180428.61.33061a Estimated by A 280 with BSA as a standard.

https://openalex.org/W2035253000,"To explain the myotoxic effects of snake venoms, we searched for inhibitors of α7β1 integrin, the major laminin-binding integrin in skeletal muscle. We discovered two inhibitors in the venom of Vipera lebetina. One of them, lebein-1 (known as lebein), has already been proposed to be a disintegrin because of its RGD-containing primary sequence. The other, lebein-2, is a novel protein that also interacts firmly with α3β1, α6β1, and α7β1 integrins, but not with the collagen-binding α1β1 and α2β1 integrins. Ligand binding of laminin-recognizing β1 integrins was efficiently blocked by both lebein-1 and lebein-2. In cell attachment assays, lebein-1 and lebein-2 inhibited myoblast attachment not only to laminin, but also to fibronectin. However, neither lebein-1 nor lebein-2 interacted with α7β1 integrin in an RGD-dependent manner, similar to the interaction of the laminin with α7β1 integrin. Identical divalent cation dependence of integrin binding to laminin and to either of the two inhibitors and their mutually exclusive binding suggest that both lebein-1 and lebein-2 interact with the ligand-binding site of laminin-binding β1 integrins by mimicking the yet unknown integrin-binding structure of laminins. Like lebein-1, lebein-2 is a soluble heterodimeric disintegrin of low molecular mass. Together with membrane-bound ADAM-2 and ADAM-9, the two inhibitors seem to form a small group of disintegrins that can bind to laminin-binding β1 integrins. Because of their inhibitory capability both in vitro and in vivo, lebein-1 and lebein-2 may be valuable tools in influencing laminin-induced, integrin-mediated cell functions such as cell anchorage, migration, and mechanical force transduction on laminin-rich basement membranes.

Integrins are cell adhesion molecules consisting of two genetically non-related α and β subunits (reviewed in Refs. 1Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc.

Different combinations of these subunits give rise to 24 known integrin receptors with distinct ligand-binding specificities. The β1 subunit-containing integrins are receptors mainly for extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. proteins such as collagen, laminin, and fibronectin and are responsible for cell anchorage and motility. Moreover, by transducing mechanical forces between cells and the ECM, integrins maintain the tension within tissue and, consequently, tissue shape and structure. At the myotendinous junction, β1 integrins, especially α7β1 integrin, are thought to play a pivotal role (3Mayer U. Saher G. Fässler R. Bornemann A. Echtermeyer F. von der Mark H. Miosge N.

The basement membrane of the myotendinous junction is enriched in laminin-2 (11Schuler F. Sorokin L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3795-3805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Merely differing in its α chain, laminin-2 has the β1 and γ1 chains in common with laminin-1. The networks of both laminin and type IV collagen, together with smaller proteins such as nidogen and proteoglycans, form the molecular basis of the basement membrane. The laminin meshwork of the basement membrane allows integrin-mediated anchorage of muscle fibers and other cells (9Timpl R. Brown J.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 10Tunggal P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. Ott M.-C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, basement membranes separate the connective tissue from any other tissue. Only certain cells such as leukocytes and invasively growing tumor cells are able to penetrate through the basement membrane. Other processes such as wound healing require cell movement along the basement membrane. Cell migration through and along the basement membrane is mediated by laminin-binding integrins (5Belkin A.M.

Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Some snake venoms contain components that are selectively directed against integrins. These so-called disintegrins interfere with the ability of integrins to bind to their cognate ECM ligands. Hence, cell/matrix interactions are disrupted, and tissue integrity is destroyed. However, snake venoms are known to exert several different effects on snakebite victims, among which are failure of the cardiovascular system and damages to muscle and neural tissue. In addition to disintegrins, these pleiotropic effects are caused by a variety of venom proteins. Being abundant in most snake venoms, phospholipase A2 is mainly responsible for myotoxic effects (13Mebs D. Ownby C.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 48: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14Harris J.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 31: 79-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Various proteases of snake venoms specifically cleave blood-clotting factors or components of the ECM, thus resulting in bleeding dysfunctions and tissue necrosis (15Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W.

Most disintegrins known to date contain an RGD sequence mimicking the ligands for the platelet αIIbβ3 and other RGD-dependent integrins (18Calvete J.J. Eble J.A. Kühn K. Integrin-Ligand Interaction. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1997: 157-174Crossref Google Scholar), which cause failure of αIIbβ3 integrin-mediated platelet aggregation and blood clotting. Moreover, disintegrins are not limited to snake venoms, but are also found as domains in ADAM (adisintegrin and ametalloproteinase) family members, multidomain proteins that are abundant in a wide range of animal species (15Bjarnason J.B. Fox J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 345-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 19White J.M. Bigler D. Chem M. Takahashi Y. Wolfsberg T.G. Beckerle M.C. Cell Adhesion. Vol. 39.

From the venom of Vipera lebetina, we have purified and characterized two inhibitors that target laminin-binding integrins. One of them is the recently described lebein. Although it has been proposed to be a disintegrin for RGD-dependent integrins (22Gasmi A. Srairi N. Guermazi S. Dkhil H. Karoui H. El Ayeb M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we show in this work that lebein or lebein-1, as we refer to it, also avidly binds to the laminin-binding β1 integrins in an RGD-independent manner. In addition, we isolated a new disintegrin (lebein-2) with homology to lebein-1 and similar binding specificity. The interaction of both inhibitors with laminin-binding β1 integrins both in vitro and in in vivo cell attachment assays demonstrates their potential to manipulate integrin-dependent cell/laminin interactions. Recombinant Production of Soluble Integrins—For the construction of pUC-hygMT-α7X2-Fos, the α7 integrin cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA isolated from mouse myotubes and verified by sequencing. The α7X2 integrin ectodomain cDNA encoding amino acids 1–1036 was generated by PCR, introducing an additional SalI site at the 3′-end. The α3 integrin ectodomain-coding cDNA of the previously described vector pUC-hygMT-α3-Fos (7Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was replaced by the α7X2 integrin ectodomain. The construct pUC-hygMT-α6X1-Fos, coding for the α6 integrin ectodomain splice variant X1 (amino acids 1–989 of the published sequence) (23Hogervorst F. Kuikman I. Kessel V. Geurts A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), was generated by isolating the HindIII- and XbaI-flanked cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–938 of the α6 integrin ectodomain from pRC-CMV-α6X1 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Sonnenberg, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and by synthesizing an XbaI- and SalI-flanked cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 939–989 of the α6 integrin ectodomain by standard PCR. Taking advantage of the SalI site, the two cDNA fragments were directionally inserted into the pUC-hygMT-α3-Fos vector (7Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R.

The vector pUC-hygMT-β1-Jun was generated previously (7Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E.

Together with the pUC-hygMT-β1-Jun vector, the vectors pUC-hygMT-α7X2-Fos and pUC-hygMT-α6X1-Fos were cotransfected into Drosophila Schneider's cells, and single cell clones were established as described previously (7Eble J.A.

Integrin Inhibition ELISA—To screen for inhibition of integrin-mediated laminin binding, microtiter plates were coated with 6 μg/ml murine laminin-1 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Timpl, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) or 10 μg/ml human laminin-2/4 (Merosin, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, containing 1 mm MgCl2 (TBS/MgCl2 buffer) overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific protein-binding sites were blocked with 1% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS/MgCl2 buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Together with protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1,10-phenanthroline (each at 1 mm) and aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (each at 3 μg/ml), soluble α7β1 integrin was added at a concentration of 15 nm in 1% heat-denatured BSA in TBS, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2, either without any supplements (positive control) or with 10 mm EDTA (nonspecific binding, negative control) or with snake venom solutions of 2 mg/ml. Lyophilized snake venoms were purchased from the Berchtesgadner Schlangenfarm (Berchtesgaden, Germany) and Sigma. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, wells were washed twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2. Bound α7β1 integrin was fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in the same buffer for 10 min at room temperature and detected in an ELISA procedure using rabbit antiserum directed against the human β1 integrin subunit (1: 400; kind gift of Dr. K. Kühn, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1: 600; Sigma) as described previously (7Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and subtracted from all values. For the calculation of the relative inhibitory activity, binding signals in the presence of inhibitor were normalized to the non-inhibited control. Isolation of Lebein-1 and Lebein-2—Lyophilized venom of V. lebetina was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm EDTA and separated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in the same buffer. The fractions containing the α7β1 integrin-inhibiting fractions were pooled; diluted with 20 mm MES, pH 6.0; and loaded onto a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences AB). The α7β1 integrin inhibitory activities of lebein-2 and lebein-1 were eluted in linear sodium chloride gradients at 80 and 140 mm, respectively. The eluate fractions were individually pooled and separated on a C8 reversed-phase column (Nucleosil, Macherey Nagel) in a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 80% acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid/water. Lebein-1 and lebein-2 were eluted as individual peaks, lyophilized, and dissolved in water. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay. Purity was proven by SDS-PAGE. Far-Western Blotting—After separation by SDS-PAGE, snake venom proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). After nonspecific binding had been blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA in TBS/MgCl2 buffer, 50 nm soluble α7β1 integrin was added in the same solution supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2. Bound α7β1 integrin was fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min and detected by rabbit antiserum against the human β1 integrin subunit (1:400) and subsequently by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:700). Both antibodies were applied in 1% heat-denatured BSA in TBS/MgCl2 buffer, followed by three washes with TBS/MgCl2 buffer. The overlay blot was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate /nitro blue tetrazolium solution (Sigma). Binding of Integrins to Lebein-1 and Lebein-2—Lebein-1 and lebein-2 (each at 3 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), the CB4 fragment of human type IV collagen (10 μg/ml in TBS/MgCl2 buffer), murine laminin-1 (10 μg/ml in TBS/MgCl2 buffer), human laminin-5 (10 μg/ml in TBS/MgCl2 buffer), and bovine type I collagen (20 μg/ml in 0.1 m acetic acid) were immobilized onto microtiter plates overnight at 4 °C. After a blocking step, soluble integrins were added at 50 nm in 1% heat-denatured BSA in TBS/MgCl2 buffer in the presence of either 1 mm MnCl2 or 10 mm EDTA. α2β1 integrin was further activated by addition of the β1 integrin-activating antibody 9EG7 (kindly provided by Dr. D. Vestweber, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation, Münster, Germany) (25Lenter M. Uhlig H. Hamann A. Jenö P. Imhof B. Vestweber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9051-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Bound integrin was fixed and detected in an ELISA-type procedure as described before. RGD Peptide Inhibition Assay—Lebein-1 and lebein-2 (each at 3 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and murine laminin-1 (at 6 μg/ml in TBS/MgCl2 buffer) were coated onto microtiter plates overnight at 4 °C. After washing and blockage with 1% BSA in TBS/MgCl2 buffer, soluble α7β1 integrin at 10.4 μg/ml (for lebein-1 and lebein-2 binding) and 1.3 μg/ml (for laminin binding) was added to the wells in the presence of peptides GRGDS, GRGES, and GRDGS (Bachem Biochemica GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) for 2 h. Bound integrin was detected as described above. Cell Adhesion Inhibition Tests—Microtiter plates were coated with fibronectin (gift of Dr. M. Humphries, University of Manchester) and murine laminin-1 at 10 and 40 μg/ml, respectively, overnight at 4 °C. After blocking for 6 h with 1% BSA in water, 100 μl of a C2C12 cell suspension (0.8 × 106 cells/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum and containing a 1:3 serial dilution of lebein-1 and lebein-2 were added to the wells and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After the supernatant had carefully been discarded, attached cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 70% ethanol. After air-drying, cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. For 100% binding values, lebein-1 and lebein-2 were replaced by an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Three experiments with duplicate measurements were carried out. Recombinant Production of a Soluble α7β1 Integrin—α7X2β1 integrin is the major laminin receptor in adult skeletal muscle. To establish a protein interaction assay, we first generated soluble α7X2β1 integrin, similar to the recombinant production of soluble α3β1 and α2β1 integrins (7Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W.

The α7X2-Fos/β1-Jun integrin ectodomain heterodimer, hereafter called soluble α7β1 integrin, consists of the ectodomains of both integrin subunits, to the C termini of which the dimerizing motifs of the transcription factors Fos and Jun have been fused. Although the cDNAs of the α7X2 and β1 chains were from murine and human origins, respectively, the integrin heterodimer is formed and secreted by the insect cells with an expression yield (∼600 μg/liter) comparable to that of soluble α3β1 integrin (7Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Soluble α7β1 integrin was purified by affinity chromatography on a resin to which the cell-binding domain of invasin had been immobilized (Fig. 1A). The biological activity of the soluble α7β1 integrin was tested qualitatively and quantitatively on different ECM substrates. As shown in Fig. 1B, α7β1 integrin showed a higher binding signal for laminin-1 than for laminin-2/4. Laminin-2 is the most abundant laminin isoform of basement membranes in muscle tissue. In contrast, laminin-5 was not recognized. As expected from the purification protocol, invasin, a surface protein of Yersinia bacteria, also interacted with soluble α7β1 integrin (Fig. 1B). Like other integrins, α7β1 integrin is activated for ligand binding by Mn2+ ions. However, unlike other integrins, this activation seems sufficient, as addition of the integrin-activating antibody 9EG7, directed against the β1 integrin subunit (25Lenter M. Uhlig H. Hamann A. Jenö P. Imhof B. Vestweber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9051-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), did not increase the binding further. In the presence of EDTA, binding to any ligand was completely abolished, thus confirming the dependence of α7β1 integrin on divalent cations (Fig. 1B). Binding of soluble α7X2β1 integrin to immobilized laminin-1 and laminin-2/4 was further studied by an ELISA-type titration assay, from which apparent K d values could be calculated according to Heyn and Weischet (26Heyn M.P. Weischet W.O. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2447-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, specific binding of soluble α7β1 integrin to the immobilized laminin isoforms reached saturation. In the presence of Mn2+ ions, α7β1 integrin bound more avidly to laminin-1 (K d = 0.2 nm) than to laminin-2/4 (K d = 2.3 nm). Addition of the activating antibody 9EG7 did not shift the titration curves to lower α7β1 integrin concentrations and did not alter its apparent affinity constants significantly. However, Ca2+ ions reduced α7β1 integrin binding to both laminin-1 and laminin-2/4, thus increasing the apparent K d values by ∼15-fold (Fig. 1C). Screening Various Snake Venoms for Their Capability to Interfere with α7β1 Integrin Binding to Laminin-1—Playing a key role in skeletal muscle, α7β1 integrin conceivably is a target for myotoxic snake venoms. Because of its high affinity for α7β1 integrin, we chose laminin-1 as its interaction partner to search for a snake venom inhibitor to this interaction (Table I). Crude snake venoms and soluble α7β1 integrin were added to laminin-1-coated microtiter plates. Protease inhibitors were also supplemented to avoid proteolytic degradation of integrin or its ligand by the numerous proteases that are abundant in snake venoms. Of 33 snake venoms tested that may cause severe muscular dysfunctions, such as venoms of the Elapidae, Viperidae, and Crotalidae families, only the venom of V. lebetina showed a drastic abolition of α7β1 integrin binding to laminin-1 (Table I). Titration of the V. lebetina venom demonstrated that it suppressed α7β1 integrin binding entirely to both laminin-1 and laminin-2/4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2).Table IInhibition of α7β1 integrin binding to laminin-1 by Elapidae, Viperidae, and Crotalidae snake venomsSpeciesBinding of α7β1 integrin to laminin-1% of non-inhibited controlElapidaeNaja naja naja96.3 ± 6.8Naja haje96.2 ± 5.2Naja kaouthia98.6 ± 1.2Naja melanoleuca109.36 ± 1.0Naja nigricollis101.2 ± 7.3Naja nivea100.4 ± 3.0Naja pallida98.3 ± 9.4Ophiophagus hannah95.8 ± 19.8ViperidaeBitis arietans89.5 ± 11.7Bitis gabonica88.0 ± 10.5Echis carinatus61.8 ± 3.3V. lebetina-5.0 ± 0.4Vipera berus106.3 ± 4.1CrotalidaeAgkistrodon bilineatus81.2 ± 21.4Agkistrodon blomhoffii97.2 ± 0.2Agkistrodon contortix96.6 ± 1.0Agkistrodon piscivorus84.1 ± 0.0Bothrops atrox97.7 ± 0.8Botrops jararaca85.5 ± 0.2Bothrops neuwiedi86.3 ± 3.8Calloselasma rhodostoma79.5 ± 2.5Crotalus adamanteus102.2 ± 2.0Crotalus atrox103.3 ± 2.3Crotalus durissimus cumanensis98.7 ± 0.5Crotalus durissimus terrificus101.9 ± 2.6Crotalus horridus104.7 ± 0.1Crotalus vegrandis109.1 ± 3.8Crotalus viridis oreganus101.9 ± 0.4Trimeresurus elegans89.2 ± 4.3Trimeresurus flavoviridis80.3 ± 4.9Trimeresurus okinavensis86.0 ± 2.5Trimeresurus popeiorum85.3 ± 4.0Trimeresurus stejnegeri89.5 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Purification of the α7β1 Integrin Inhibitory Activity of the V. lebetina Venom—To purify the α7β1 integrin inhibitor, the venom was separated by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase chromatography. From the gel filtration column, the α7β1 integrin inhibitory activity was eluted in a single peak (Fig. 3A, gray bar). However, further purification on a Mono S column separated the inhibitory activity into two different fractions, called MS-I and MS-II (Fig. 3B). Each of these two inhibitory peaks, MS-I and MS-II, showed a characteristic elution profile upon reversed-phase chromatography (Fig. 4, A and B). Fraction MS-I could not further be separated by reversed-phase chromatography and contained only one inhibitor that eluted as a single peak (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Purification of lebein-2 and lebein-1 from the two Mono S fractions (MS-I and MS-II) by reversed-phase chromatography on a C8 reversed-phase column. The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 280 nm (solid lines). Eluate fractions were tested for inhibition of α7β1 integrin binding to immobilized laminin-1 (○). A, the Mono S fraction MS-I contains one inhibitory activity, which is the novel disintegrin lebein-2. B, the Mono S fraction MS-II contains two peaks of inhibitory activities.

https://openalex.org/W2060595165,"Differentiation of hematopoietic cells from multipotential progenitors is regulated by multiple growth factors and cytokines. A prominent feature of these soluble factors is promotion of cell survival, in part mediated by expression of either of the anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL-2 and BCL-XL. The complex expression pattern of these frequently redundant survival factors during hematopoiesis may indicate a role in lineage determination. To investigate the latter possibility, we analyzed factor-dependent cell-Patersen (FDCP)-Mix multipotent progenitor cells in which we stably expressed BCL-2 or BCL-XL. Each factor maintained complete survival of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-deprived FDCP-Mix cells but, unexpectedly, directed FDCP-Mix cells along restricted and divergent differentiation pathways. Thus, IL-3-deprived FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells differentiated exclusively to granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, whereas FDCP-Mix BCL-XL cells became erythroid. FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells grown in IL-3 were distinguished from FDCP-Mix and FDCP-Mix BCL-XL cells by a striking reduction in cellular levels of Raf-1 protein. Replacement of the BCL-2 BH4 domain with the related BCL-XL BH4 sequence resulted in a switch of FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells to erythroid fate accompanied by persistence of Raf-1 protein expression. Moreover, enforced expression of Raf-1 redirected FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells to an erythroid fate, and prohibited generation of myeloid cells. These results identify novel roles for BCL-2 and BCL-XL in cell fate decisions beyond cell survival. These effects are associated with differential regulation of Raf-1 expression, perhaps involving the previously identified interaction between BCL-2-BH4 and the catalytic domain of Raf-1. Differentiation of hematopoietic cells from multipotential progenitors is regulated by multiple growth factors and cytokines. A prominent feature of these soluble factors is promotion of cell survival, in part mediated by expression of either of the anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL-2 and BCL-XL. The complex expression pattern of these frequently redundant survival factors during hematopoiesis may indicate a role in lineage determination. To investigate the latter possibility, we analyzed factor-dependent cell-Patersen (FDCP)-Mix multipotent progenitor cells in which we stably expressed BCL-2 or BCL-XL. Each factor maintained complete survival of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-deprived FDCP-Mix cells but, unexpectedly, directed FDCP-Mix cells along restricted and divergent differentiation pathways. Thus, IL-3-deprived FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells differentiated exclusively to granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, whereas FDCP-Mix BCL-XL cells became erythroid. FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells grown in IL-3 were distinguished from FDCP-Mix and FDCP-Mix BCL-XL cells by a striking reduction in cellular levels of Raf-1 protein. Replacement of the BCL-2 BH4 domain with the related BCL-XL BH4 sequence resulted in a switch of FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells to erythroid fate accompanied by persistence of Raf-1 protein expression. Moreover, enforced expression of Raf-1 redirected FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells to an erythroid fate, and prohibited generation of myeloid cells. These results identify novel roles for BCL-2 and BCL-XL in cell fate decisions beyond cell survival. These effects are associated with differential regulation of Raf-1 expression, perhaps involving the previously identified interaction between BCL-2-BH4 and the catalytic domain of Raf-1. Hematopoietic cells are derived from multipotent progenitors present in small numbers in the adult bone marrow. Asym-metric cell divisions generate daughter cells committed to differentiation, and subsequent cell divisions are accompanied by progressive restrictions on multilineage potential. Lineage commitment appears stochastic in single cell assays of primitive hematopoietic precursors grown in multiple growth factors (1Ogawa M. Int. J. Hematol. 1999; 69: 2-5Google Scholar). Certain growth factors act to increase commitment and/or expansion of specific lineages, suggesting that lineage choice is also subject to instructive signals from the microenvironment (2Domen J. Weissman I.L. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 201-208Google Scholar, 3Metcalf D. Semin. Hematol. 1999; 36: 5-12Google Scholar). Owing to redundancies in signal transduction pathways from lineage-selective growth factor receptors, the processes leading to alternative lineage fates remain largely unknown. Growth factors, which also maintain cell survival, in addition provide general anti-apoptotic signals through receptors expressed on specific cell types. Members of the BCL-2 family of apoptotic regulators have strong effects on cell survival (4Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Puthalakath H. Bouillet P. Vairo G. Moriishi K. Hausmann G. O'Reilly L. Newton K. Ogilvy S. Bath M.L. Print C.G. Harris A.W. Strasser A. Cory S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 351-358Google Scholar, 5Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Google Scholar, 6Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Google Scholar). However, there is mounting evidence that non-lethal cell pathways are also affected by these proteins (7Pietenpol J.A. Papadopoulos N. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3714-3717Google Scholar). For instance, BCL-2 and BCL-XL delay cell cycle re-entry. These effects can be separated from anti-apoptotic activities by mutations in the BH4 domain and, in one example, appear to involve binding of the cytoplasmic serine-threonine phosphatase, calcineurin, to the BH4 domain of BCL-2 (8Huang D.C.S. O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A. Cory S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4628-4638Google Scholar, 9Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. McKeon F. Nature. 1997; 386: 728-731Google Scholar). This agrees with earlier reports demonstrating a block to nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) with overexpression of BCL-2 in T lymphocytes (10Linette G.P. Li Y. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9545-9552Google Scholar). BCL-2 expression influences differentiation in several cell types, including hematopoietic, neuronal, and epithelial cells (4Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Puthalakath H. Bouillet P. Vairo G. Moriishi K. Hausmann G. O'Reilly L. Newton K. Ogilvy S. Bath M.L. Print C.G. Harris A.W. Strasser A. Cory S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 351-358Google Scholar). Mice deficient for interleukin-7 or its receptor have a block in T lymphocyte development, which can be partially restored by introduction of a BCL2 transgene (11Akashi K. Kondo M. von Freeden-Jeffry U. Murray R. Weissman I.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 1033-1041Google Scholar, 12Maraskovsky E. O'Reilly L.A. Teepe M. Corcoran L.M. Peschon J.J. Strasser A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1011-1019Google Scholar). BCL-2 rescues macrophage development in macrophage-colony stimulating factor-deficient, osteopetrotic mice (13Lagasse E. Weissman I.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 1021-1031Google Scholar). In addition, BCL-2 promotes regeneration and growth of severed axons in retinal ganglion cells from adult mice and accelerates neuronal differentiation in PC-12 cells (14Sato N. Hotta K. Waguri S. Nitatori T. Tohyama K. Tsujimoto Y. Uchiyama Y. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1227-1234Google Scholar, 15Chen D.F. Schneider G.E. Martinou J.C. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1997; 385: 434-439Google Scholar). In contrast, keratinocyte differentiation and expression of the squamous cell differentiation markers, keratin 10/11 and involucrin, are inhibited by BCL-2 (16Harada H. Mitsuyasu T. Seta Y. Maruoka Y. Toyoshima K. Yasumoto S. J. Oral Pathol. Med. 1998; 27: 11-17Google Scholar). The effects of BCL-2 on retinal ganglion cells and keratinocytes are not attributable to the rescue of dying cells and are not reproduced by anti-apoptotic caspase inhibitors. Adding another level of complexity, BCL-2 and BCL-XL may have specific, non-homologous functions in hematopoiesis (4Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Puthalakath H. Bouillet P. Vairo G. Moriishi K. Hausmann G. O'Reilly L. Newton K. Ogilvy S. Bath M.L. Print C.G. Harris A.W. Strasser A. Cory S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 351-358Google Scholar). BCL-2 and BCL-XL have reciprocal expression patterns in developing T and B lymphocytes and primitive human and murine hematopoietic precursor cells (17Josefsen D. Myklebust J.H. Lomo J. Sioud M. Blomhoff H.K. Smeland E.B. Stem Cells. 2000; 18: 261-272Google Scholar, 18Park J.R. Bernstein I.D. Hockenbery D.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 868-876Google Scholar). In this report, we utilize either BCL-2 or BCL-XL to maintain survival of FDCPMix 1The abbreviations used are: FDCP-Mix, factor-dependent cell-Patersen; IL-3, interleukin-3; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; ZVAD-fmk, zVal-Ala-Asp-CH2F; BH1–4, BCL-2 homology domains 1–4; GA, geldanamycin. progenitor cells during growth factor withdrawal. We demonstrate that both BCL-2 and BCL-XL enable hematopoietic differentiation in the absence of additional growth factors, but each acts along divergent and restricted pathways. Over-expression of BCL-2 supports the development of myeloid lineages and is linked to striking changes in the expression of Raf-1 kinase. In contrast, BCL-XL restricts FDCP-Mix cells to an erythroid fate. Our results provide a basis for lineage restriction in FDCP-Mix cells and demonstrate that BCL-2 and BCL-XL are unexpected participants in this process. Specific interactions with cytoplasmic signaling pathways may govern multiple cell fate decisions for BCL-2-related proteins with otherwise redundant survival functions. Cell Lines and Expression of cDNAs—FDCP-Mix (clone A4) cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen), containing 20% horse serum (Invitrogen), and 4% rIL-3-containing supernatant (19Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Google Scholar). Cells were infected with retrovirus (MIZV: MSCV 5′ LTRX-IRES-zeocin vector) encoding wild type or mutant human Raf-1, human BCL-2, human BCL-XL, or BCL-2 BH4Bcl-x, and selected in 0.6–0.8 mg/ml zeocin (Cayla, France) (20Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H.L. Fong A.Z.C. Goldman S.J. Leonard J.P. Hawley T.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 795: 341-345Google Scholar). Alternatively, FDCP-Mix cells were stably transfected with SFFV-Bcl2 or SFFV-BclxL plasmids by electroporation (260 volts, 960 microfarads), and selected in 0.75 mg/ml active Geneticin (Invitrogen) (21Haughn L. Leung B. Boise L. Veillette A. Thompson C. Julius M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1575-1586Google Scholar). Cells were cloned by micro-manipulation into 96-well flat-bottomed plates with 5 × 105 irradiated C57BL/6 spleen cells/well and 4% rIL-3 supernatant. For serial expression of two genes, FDCP-Mix cells were initially transduced with c-Raf1 retroviral vectors and subsequently transfected with BCL2 or BCLXL plasmids. Retroviral supernatants were generated by calcium phosphate transfection of 293T cells, along with helper plasmids. Supernatants were collected over 4 days, pooled and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. FDCP-Mix cells were spin-infected with supernatants at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Differentiation Assays—Cells were starved for IL-3 by washing once in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% horse serum and seeding at 3 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% horse serum. Cytospins were performed after 40 h and stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa (Sigma). For flow cytometry analysis of Gr-1 expression, cells were preincubated with 24G2 supernatant (Fc-block), and stained with biotinylated-anti-Gr-1 or IgG2b isotype controls. Cells were subsequently stained with streptavidinallophycocyanin (BD Pharmingen). 100,000 cells were analyzed per sample on a FACSCalibur®; data were analyzed using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Antibodies—Antibodies to Raf-1 (R19120), Hsp90, BCL-2, and BCL-XL were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies to Raf-1 (URP26K), Gr-1, and biotinylated isotype controls were obtained from BD Pharmingen. Anti-FLAG (M2) was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-mouse β-globin was obtained from ICN/Cappel and human-specific hamster anti-BCL-2 (6C8) from BD Pharmingen. Rat anti-GATA-1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Immunoblotting—Western blots were developed with either goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) or, for rabbit or hamster primary reagents, Protein A-horseradish peroxidase (ICN). IL-3 blasts of the indicated cell types were harvested and processed for nuclear extracts. Briefly, cells were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer, and allowed to swell for 15 min on ice. Each group was subjected to five strokes with a 27-gauge syringe, and lysis was verified by trypan blue. Nuclei were spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge, and cytosol was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in hypertonic buffer for 20 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by spinning for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol was added to each extract, boiled for 5 min, loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, run for 850 v-h, and processed for Western analysis. Northern Blots—20 μg of RNA/lane was separated on formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes by capillary transfer. Mouse cDNA probes for c-Raf1 (provided by Ulf Rapp, University of Wurzburg) and 18 S rRNA (provided by Robert Gendron, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada) were labeled by random-priming (High Prime, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and purified on Sephadex G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Vectors—The BCL2BH4Bcl-x mutant plasmid was kindly provided by David Huang (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). cDNA fragments for mutant or wild type c-raf1, BCL2,or BCLXL were amplified by PCR and ligated into the MIZV retroviral vector. The retroviral vector for bicistronic expression of BCL2/BCLXL and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was derived from the cMMP backbone (kindly provided by the Mulligan laboratory, Harvard Medical School), into which an IRES-GFP cassette was cloned (22Klein C. Bueler H. Mulligan R.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1699-1708Google Scholar). Human BCL2 or BCLXL cDNAs were cloned into XbaI/BglII sites. All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Reagents—Geldanamycin was obtained from Sigma. ZVAD-fmk was obtained from ICN Biochemicals. BCL-2 and BCL-XLHave Opposing Effects on Bipotent Cell Fate—FDCP-Mix progenitor cells were infected with MIZV retroviral vectors containing human BCL2 or BCLXL cDNAs. Zeocin (zeo)-resistant clones were derived from single cells transferred to 96-well plates by micromanipulation. Multiple clones with high expression of human BCL-2 or BCL-XL protein by immunoblotting were selected for further study. Non-transduced FDCP-Mix cells, and FDCP-Mix zeo, FDCPMix BCL-2, and FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones had similar growth characteristics and maintained undifferentiated blast morphology in the presence of IL-3 (IL-3 blasts; Fig. 1 A, B, and E). IL-3 withdrawal from FDCP-Mix BCL-2 or FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones prevented cell growth, but viability remained >95% for at least 48 h. In contrast, both FDCP-Mix zeo and non-transduced FDCP-Mix cells underwent rapid death upon IL-3 withdrawal (>90% of cells were trypan blue-positive at 24 h). Cytospins of FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones were performed after 40 h of IL-3 withdrawal and examined by May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining. A complete shift in morphology to granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages was observed. The ratio of granulocytes to monocytes/macrophages among different FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones varied from 50:50 to 30:70. In 20 different FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones examined, fewer than 2% of cells with erythroid morphology were observed. FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones were examined similarly. In striking contrast to the results for BCL-2, BCL-XL-expressing cells uniformly gave rise to erythroblasts upon IL-3 deprivation, with virtually no granulocytes or monocytes observed. This result was also repeated in 20 separate clones. Among a larger group of 40 clonal lines of each type, 35/40 FDCP-Mix BCL-2 and 39/40 FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones produced the same pattern of restricted myeloid and erythroid differentiation, respectively, upon IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 1, C and F). A small number of phenotypic variants were observed in each of the two groups of transduced FDCP-Mix clones. These clones also had restricted differentiation but with the opposite pattern to the majority of clones. Thus, 5/40 FDCPMix BCL-2 and 1/40 FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones produced restricted erythroid and myeloid phenotypes, respectively, after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 1, D and G). Notably, expression levels of human BCL-2 in the FDCP-BCL-2 clones did not correlate with specific lineage fate (see Fig. 3A). To address the possibility that the restricted differentiation phenotypes we observed were a result of the cloning process, we generated bicistronic BCL2 and BCLXL-expressing retroviral vectors containing an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) upstream of the GFP marker gene. FDCP-Mix cells were sorted for GFP expression by flow cytometry at 72 h after transduction (Fig. 1H). We found that resuspending the cells in 0.2% rIL-3 medium (20-fold dilution) slowed the death of control cells, such that >60% of cells remained viable at 40 h. Sorted GFP-positive cells were replated in 0.2% IL-3 and examined for differentiation morphology after 40 h. Control FDCP-Mix IRES-GFP cells retained a primitive cell morphology under these conditions (Fig. 1I). Cells transduced with the BCL2-GFP vector differentiated into myeloid lineage cells in 0.2% IL-3; in contrast, IL-3-deprived cells expressing BCL-XL-GFP contained exclusively erythroblasts (Fig. 1, J and K). To quantify the restricted differentiation in the FDCP-Mix BCL-2 and FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones, we analyzed for lineage-specific markers. FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones acquired the granulocytic marker, Gr-1, upon IL-3 withdrawal, whereas FDCPMix BCL-XL cells remained Gr-1-negative by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Erythroid differentiation was evaluated by expression of the erythropoietin receptor, by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis, and β-globin, by immunoblotting. RT-PCR amplification of EpoR mRNA was detected in IL-3-deprived FDCP-Mix BCL-XL but not FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones (data not shown). FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones produced high levels of mouse β-globin in the absence of IL-3, with little to no β-globin expressed in FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones (Fig. 2B). Similarly, FDCP-Mix BCL-XL, but not FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones, expressed the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1 (Fig. 2C). These results confirm the morphologic assessment of restricted myeloid and erythroid differentiation. Thus, BCL-2 expression dictates myeloid lineage choice, and BCL-XL expression specifies erythroid cell fate, under circumstances in which selective cell survival appears to play no role. Raf-1 Protein Expression in FDCP-Mix IL-3 Blasts Predicts Differentiation Pattern of BCL-2/BCL-XLExpression—In addition to heterodimer associations with pro-apoptotic family members, BCL-2 physically interacts with several cytoplasmic proteins, including calcineurin, Raf-1 kinase, Bag-1, and p23-R-Ras (6Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Google Scholar). In a survey of these proteins, we observed differences in Raf-1 expression between FDCP-Mix BCL-2 and FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones. Raf-1 protein was undetectable by immunoblotting of total cell lysates from all FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones that formed myeloid cells (denoted FDCP-Mix BCL-2-myeloid). Importantly, the loss of Raf-1 expression was observed in FDCPMix BCL-2-myeloid clones grown in high concentrations of IL-3 and thus preceded differentiation. In contrast, Raf-1 protein was consistently observed in FDCP-Mix BCL-XL-erythroid clones at levels comparable to non-transduced and FDCP-Mix zeo controls (Fig. 3, A and B). We obtained an identical result with two different Raf-1-specific antibodies (Fig. 3A). The rare BCL-2 and BCL-XL clones with variant differentiation phenotypes gave discordant results. We failed to detect Raf-1 in the single FDCP-Mix BCL-XL-myeloid clone isolated, but each of the five FDCP-Mix BCL-2-erythroid clones consistently expressed Raf-1 protein (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, presence or absence of Raf-1 protein in undifferentiated IL-3 blasts predicted with complete accuracy the differentiation phenotype for that clone upon IL-3 withdrawal. The influence of Raf-1 expression on cell differentiation takes precedence over the effects of BCL-2 and BCL-XL, suggesting that Raf-1 acts downstream of BCL-2 and BCL-XL. However, differences in Raf-1 expression are unrelated to the anti-apoptotic functions of BCL-2 and BCL-XL, as IL-3-independent survival of both sets of FDCP-Mix BCL-2 and FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones exceeded 95% at 40 h. The Raf family of serine/threonine kinases includes two additional members, A-Raf and B-Raf. B-Raf is selectively expressed in nervous tissue, whereas Raf-1 and A-Raf are more widely expressed (23Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351Google Scholar). We examined A-Raf expression by immunoblotting. The 64-kDa A-Raf protein was expressed at comparable levels in IL-3 blasts of FDCP-Mix BCL-2, FDCP-Mix BCL-XL, and FDCP-Mix neo cells, with down-regulation in IL-3-deprived cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, the loss of Raf-1 expression in FDCP-Mix BCL-2-myeloid cells does not reflect a general suppression of protein expression but appears to be specific for Raf-1, even among closely related family members. Northern blots of total cytoplasmic RNA demonstrated equivalent expression of c-raf1 RNA in FDCP-Mix BCL-2, FDCP-Mix BCL-XL, and FDCP-Mix neo control cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, c-raf1 RNA levels were comparable in FDCP-Mix BCL-2-myeloid and FDCP-Mix BCL-2-erythroid clones and, therefore, independent of specific differentiation phenotype. These results indicate a post-transcriptional mechanism for the decrease in Raf-1 protein in the presence of BCL-2. Raf-1 Down-regulation Requires the BCL-2 BH4 Domain— The conserved BCL-2 homology 4 (BH4) domains are NH2-proximal regions of approximately 20 amino acids each (Fig. 5E). The BCL-2 and BCL-XL BH4 regions differ in the relative spacing of charged and polar residues. Although the BCL-2-BH4 domain has been found to associate with Raf-1, Bag-1, and calcineurin, protein-protein interactions involving the BCL-XL-BH4 domain have not been described in similar detail (6Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Google Scholar, 9Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. McKeon F. Nature. 1997; 386: 728-731Google Scholar, 10Linette G.P. Li Y. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9545-9552Google Scholar, 24Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Google Scholar). To determine if the BH4 domains of BCL-2 and BCL-XL are involved in their specific effects on cell fate and Raf-1 protein levels, we tested a chimeric BCL-2 protein in which the endogenous BH4 domain is replaced by the homologous sequence from BCL-XL. This BCL-2 BH4Bcl-x mutant has full survival function (25Huang D.C.S. Adams J.M. Cory S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1029-1039Google Scholar). A corresponding BCL-XL construct bearing the BCL-2 BH4 domain sequence lacked survival function and could not be further evaluated. FDCP-Mix cells were stably infected with retrovirus containing BCL2 BH4Bcl-x. In contrast to the restricted myeloid differentiation seen with BCL-2, FDCP-Mix BCL-2 BH4Bcl-x clones formed uniformly erythroid cells when deprived of IL-3 (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, immunoblots revealed that expression of endogenous Raf-1 was restored in BCL-2 BH4Bcl-x clones in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 5A). Cell survival was maintained at high levels over 5 days for IL-3-deprived FDCP-Mix BCL-2 BH4Bcl-x, FDCP-Mix BCL-2, and FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones, indicating that the specific differentiation effects of the anti-apoptotic proteins are loosely coupled to survival functions (Fig. 5D). The ability of BCL-2 to slow cell cycle re-entry can also be dissociated from its survival function by mutations within the BH4 region (8Huang D.C.S. O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A. Cory S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4628-4638Google Scholar). A role for the BCL-2-BH4 domain in down-regulating Raf-1 protein expression is consistent with this helical domain as a site of protein-protein interactions and supports the hypothesis that Raf-1 is an effector of BCL-2 differentiation activity. Expression of Raf-1 Converts FDCP-Mix BCL-2 Cells to Erythroid Fate—To test whether Raf-1 operates as a switch for lineage choice in FDCP-Mix cells, we generated FDCP-Mix cell lines co-expressing Raf-1 and BCL-2 (Fig. 6A). The introduction of Raf-1 redirected FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells to an exclusively erythroid fate in 20/20 individual clones analyzed (Fig. 6B). FDCP-Mix Raf-1-BCL-2 cells also expressed GATA-1, in contrast to cells transduced with BCL2 alone (Fig. 6C). Co-expression of Raf-1 and BCL-XL did not alter the predominant erythroid phenotype associated with FDCP-Mix BCL-XL cells (Fig. 6, D–F). Transduction of c-raf1 by itself did not confer IL-3-independent survival or induce differentiation of FDCP-Mix cells (data not shown). However, the addition of zVAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, to FDCP-Mix Raf-1 cells allowed early erythroid differentiation following IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 6H). In contrast to the accumulation of differentiated cells observed with BCL-2 or BCL-XL, IL-3-deprived FDCP-Mix cells maintained an undifferentiated appearance in the presence of zVAD-fmk (Fig. 6G). Co-expression of a constitutively active, truncated Raf-1, including only the catalytic CR3 domain, CAT-Raf (26Stanton Jr., V.P. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Google Scholar), also switched FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells to an erythroid fate following IL-3 withdrawal (data not shown). Surprisingly, a kinase-defective mutant of CAT-Raf, CAT-Raf-K375M, gave identical results (Fig. 7A). Erythroid morphologies were accompanied by expression of mouse β-globin (Fig. 7B). We demonstrated expression of the epitope-tagged 36-kDa CAT-Raf and CAT-Raf-K375M proteins using a FLAG-specific antibody (Fig. 7C and data not shown). Eight individual FDCPMix CAT-Raf-K375M/BCL-2 clones are shown in lanes 2–9. We also observed re-expression of 74-kDa Raf-1 using anti-Raf-1 antibodies (Fig. 7C). Levels of endogenous Raf-1 protein in the CAT-Raf-BCL-2-transduced clonal lines were generally higher than in non-transduced FDCP-Mix cells. One FDCP-Mix CAT-Raf-K375M/BCL-2 clonal cell line, #33 (lane 7), which produced mixed erythroid and myeloid lineages, contained notably lower expression of the Raf-1 CR3 domain mutant and lacked detectable endogenous Raf-1 protein. CAT-Raf should not interfere with Ras-dependent activation of endogenous Raf-1, due to the absence of the NH2-terminal Ras-binding domain. These results suggest that expression of the Raf-1-CR3 domain inhibits the post-transcriptional down-regulation of endogenous Raf-1 associated with BCL-2 expression, thereby preserving Raf-1 kinase levels. Because both kinase-active and inactive CAT-Raf proteins rescued expression of endogenous Raf-1 protein, Raf-1 kinase activity is dispensable for this effect. Previous work demonstrated an interaction of the Raf-1 CR3 domain with the BCL-2-BH4 domain (24Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Google Scholar). Raf-1-CR3 domains may act by interfering with protein-protein interactions between Raf-1 and another factor, possibly BCL-2, independent of associated kinase activity. As a further test of the role for Raf-1, we determined the effect of reducing Raf-1 expression in FDCP-Mix BCL-XL cells. The Hsp90 chaperone is considered essential for Raf-1 protein stability and activity (27Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Google Scholar, 28Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Google Scholar). Interference with Hsp90 function using a highly specific inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA), leads to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Raf-1 and other client proteins, and frequently, to undetectable levels of Raf-1 protein (29Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Google Scholar). We exposed FDCP-Mix BCL-XL cells to 2 μm GA and observed loss of Raf-1 protein expression by 24 h (Fig. 7D). GA treatment of FDCP-Mix BCL-XL cells switched the differentiation response to IL-3 deprivation from erythroid to myeloid (Fig. 7E). Considered together with the above results, these findings support the model that BCL-2 and BCL-XL constrain differentiation potential by their opposite effects on Raf-1 expression. Fairbairn et al. (30Fairbairn L.J. Cowling C.J. Reipert B.M. Dexter T.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 823-832Google Scholar) previously reported that IL-3-dependent FDCP-Mix hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with BCL2 underwent spontaneous multilineage differentiation following removal of IL-3. Rather than conventional stochastic or inductive differentiation models, these experiments indicated that, in the presence of sufficient intrinsic survival factors, the requirement for specific extrinsic differentiation signals is bypassed. In the present study, we used a similar approach to determine if BCL-2 and BCL-XL shared an ability to support hematopoietic differentiation. BCL-2 has been suggested to act passively on differentiation outcomes by maintaining cell survival during a vulnerable period. However, the side-by-side comparisons shown here suggest a more complex relationship between BCL-2-related survival proteins and differentiation, because BCL-2 and BCL-XL, as well as the BCL-2 BH4Bclx chimera, all maintain survival of IL-3-deprived FDCP-Mix cells, while directing alternative lineage fates. The reproducibility of the BCL-XL-erythroid and BCL-2-myeloid associations across multiple independent clones argues against random, mutational events that could restrict multipotentiality. Moreover, selection and expansion of clones were performed in the presence of IL-3, such that the eventual lineage choices remained latent. Finally, transient assays using a bicistronic vector to enable sorting of GFP-positive, transduced cells demonstrated identical phenotypes. Our results extend previous views of lineage determination by demonstrating that the intrinsic survival factors, BCL-XL and BCL-2, are not necessarily passive participants but can also direct (specify) differentiation fates. Because hematopoietic growth factors induce the expression of specific BCL-2 family members (31Hu Z.B. Minden M.D. McCulloch E.A. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 1925-1929Google Scholar, 32Huang H.M. Huang C.J. Yen J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1764-1771Google Scholar), survival and differentiation functions could converge in a single multitasking protein as a striking example of cellular economy. In screening for expression of proteins previously reported to associate with BCL-2 or BCL-XL, we discovered that Raf-1 protein could not be detected in immunoblots of FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cell lysates. Only 5/40 FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones had measurable Raf-1 protein, and remarkably, each gave rise to erythroid cells following removal of IL-3. Raf-1 protein levels in FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones were comparable to control cells. FDCP-Mix BCL-XL and FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones expressed similar levels of c-raf1 RNA, indicating a post-transcriptional level of regulation. Raf-1 protein was undetectable in only 1 out of 40 independent FDCP-Mix BCL-XL clones, and this clone reproducibly differentiated to myeloid cells upon IL-3 withdrawal. Thus, in every instance, where Raf-1 protein is observed, erythroid differentiation ensues and absence of Raf-1 is accompanied by myeloid differentiation. The importance of Raf-1 in FDCP-Mix cell fate was demonstrated by showing that introduction of c-raf1 into FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells switched the differentiated phenotype from myeloid to erythroid upon IL-3 withdrawal. This result makes evident an epistatic relationship between Raf-1 and BCL-2, which was previously suggested by analysis of FDCP-Mix BCL-2 clones with variant differentiation phenotypes. In this context, it is notable that constitutive expression of Raf-1 by itself, when coupled with the neutral inhibitor of apoptosis, zVAD-fmk, initiates erythroid differentiation once IL-3 is removed. Conversely, accelerated turnover of Raf-1 protein in geldanamycin-treated FDCP-Mix-BCL-XL cells is associated with redirection to myeloid differentiation. Both constitutively active, truncated Raf-1 (CAT-Raf) and CAT-Raf-1 with an active site mutation to disable kinase activity produced a switch of FDCP-Mix BCL-2 differentiation from myeloid to erythroid. Thus, the kinase activity of the introduced Raf-1 appears to be irrelevant for production of erythroid cells. However, both CR3-only c-raf1 constructs led to restoration of endogenous Raf-1 protein levels in BCL-2-expressing FDCP-Mix cells. This result suggests that the disappearance of endogenous Raf-1 protein requires the COOH-terminal CR3 domain, and furthermore, that CR3-only mutant proteins compete with endogenous Raf-1 for binding to another factor. BCL-2, via its Raf-1-binding BH4 domain, is one candidate for this factor. We show that a BCL-2 mutant with its BH4 domain replaced by its counterpart in BCL-XL does not lead to loss of Raf-1 expression and that FDCP-Mix cells expressing this BCL-2 BH4Bcl-x chimera are directed to an erythroid fate after IL-3 washout. This identifies BH4 as a structural domain of BCL-2 that regulates both Raf-1 expression and lineage choice and suggests that Raf-1 is an effector for the BCL-2 differentiation activity. Raf-1 associates with several protein chaperones in vivo, including 14-3-3, Hsp 90, 70, and 60, and Hsc70, to stabilize protein folding and activity (33Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21711-21716Google Scholar, 34Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Google Scholar). Interference with chaperone function, using geldanamycin to inhibit Hsp90, for example, results in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Raf-1 (29Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Google Scholar). The CR3 domain of Raf-1 is sufficient for Hsp90 association (33Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Hutchison K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21711-21716Google Scholar). Because the BCL-2-BH4 domain also binds to the Raf-1-CR3 domain, BCL-2 may destabilize Raf-1 by restricting its access to Hsp90. BCL-2 also interacts with Bag-1, a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsc70 and Hsp70 (35Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Hohfeld J. Hart F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Google Scholar). Although Bag-1 interactions appear to stabilize some proteins, binding of Bag-1 to the ATPase domain of Hsc70/Hsp70 inhibits protein refolding (36Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 23: 6871-6878Google Scholar, 37Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Google Scholar). Bag-1 also associates with the 26 S proteasome through an NH2-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, coupling Hsc70/Hsp70 to the protein degradation machinery (38Lüders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Google Scholar). A recent report describes binding of Hsp90 to BCL-2, resulting in stabilization of BCL-2 protein expression (39Dias S. Shmelkov S.V. Lam G. Rafii S. Blood. 2002; 99: 2532-2540Google Scholar). Expression of BCL-XL and BCL-2 is controlled by distinct sets of transcription factors, perhaps explaining their striking, non-redundant expression in hematopoietic cells (40Arcinas M. Heckman C.A. Mehew J.W. Boxer L.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5202-5206Google Scholar, 41Sevilla L. Zaldumbide A. Pognonec P. Boulukos K.E. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 595-601Google Scholar). BCL-XL is expressed in pro-erythroblasts and erythroblasts in vivo, with levels increasing 50-fold during terminal erythroid differentiation (42Gregoli P.A. Bondurant M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 630-640Google Scholar). Fetal liver hematopoietic cells die prematurely in BCLXL-deficient mice, and conditional deletion of BCLXL causes anemia with increased death of late erythroid precursors (43Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Google Scholar, 44Wagner K.U Claudio E. Rucker E.B. Riedlinger G. Broussard C. Schwartzberg P.L. Siebenlist U. Hennighausen L. Development. 2000; 127: 4949-4958Google Scholar). BCLXL-deficient ES cells do not generate mature, viable definitive erythroid cells in vitro and, moreover, fail to contribute to circulating erythrocytes in adult chimeric mice (45Motoyama N. Kimura T. Takahashi T. Watanabe T. Nakano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1691-1698Google Scholar). BCL-2 is expressed primarily in the B and T lymphoid compartments and in early hematopoietic precursors. Expression of a vav-BCL2 transgene in hematopoietic cells produced large increases in numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes, but not erythrocytes, and was accompanied by a 2-fold reduction in nucleated erythroblasts in the bone marrow (46Ogilvy S. Metcalf D. Print C.G. Bath M.L. Harris A.W. Adams J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14943-14948Google Scholar). Two groups have reported that Raf-1 is not expressed in primary neutrophils (47Grinstein S. Furuya W. Butler J.R. Tseng J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20223-20231Google Scholar, 48Lloyds D. Hallett M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1267: 65-74Google Scholar). We confirmed the absence of Raf-1 in CD15+ human neutrophil lysates (data not shown), whereas Raf-1 was readily detected by immunoprecipitation in lysates of CD15– cells (primarily lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils). Similarly, granulocytic differentiation of HL60 promyeloid cells is accompanied by a striking loss of Raf-1 protein (48Lloyds D. Hallett M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1267: 65-74Google Scholar). Our observations in FDCP-Mix BCL-2 cells implicate BCL-2 in the mechanism of Raf-1 down-regulation. Lineage fate decisions in this model may depend on a threshold effect for some parameter, modulated by BCL-2/BCL-XL through Raf-1, which has a probability distribution within the cell population. At either extreme, represented by high expression of BCL-2 and BCL-XL, and subsequent effects on Raf-1, cell differentiation becomes skewed toward myeloid and erythroid cell fates, respectively. This model might explain the variable effects of manipulating BCL-2 and BCL-XL expression on hematopoietic lineage determination in published in vivo and in vitro models. At intermediate levels of BCL-2 or BCL-XL, both erythroid and myeloid-specifying values of the parameter would be represented and bi-phenotypic patterns of differentiation would be observed. Direct comparisons of the effects of introducing BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-2 BH4Bcl-x into primary multipotent hematopoietic progenitors may offer further insights into normal mechanisms of lineage restriction during hematopoiesis (49Chalandon Y.

However, it was unclear whether S100A1/RyR1 interaction could modulate SR Ca2+ handling and contractile properties in skeletal muscle fibers. Since S100A1 protein is differentially expressed in fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, we used saponin-skinned murine Musculus extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and Musculus soleus (Soleus) fibers to assess the impact of S100A1 protein on SR Ca2+ release and isometric twitch force in functionally intact permeabilized muscle fibers. S100A1 equally enhanced caffeine-induced SR Ca2+ release and Ca2+-induced isometric force transients in both muscle preparations in a dose-dependent manner. Introducing a synthetic S100A1 peptide model (devoid of EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites) allowed identification of the S100A1 C terminus (amino acids 75–94) and hinge region (amino acids 42–54) to differentially enhance SR Ca2+ release with a nearly 3-fold higher activity of the C terminus. These effects were exclusively based on enhanced SR Ca2+ release as S100A1 influenced neither SR Ca2+ uptake nor myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity/cooperativity in our experimental setting. In conclusion, our study shows for the first time that S100A1 augments contractile performance both of fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers based on enhanced SR Ca2+ efflux at least mediated by the C terminus of S100A1 protein. Thus, our data suggest that S100A1 may serve as an endogenous enhancer of SR Ca2+ release and might therefore be of physiological relevance in the process of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.

S100A1, a low molecular mass (M r 10,000) Ca2+-binding protein of the EF-hand type, belongs to the multigenic S100 protein family whose members have been implicated in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of a variety of cellular functions including Ca2+ homeostasis and contractility of striated and smooth muscle tissue (1Remppis A.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). S100 proteins form an important subclass of EF-hand proteins that are typically small, ∼90 residues (two EF-hand modules), and dimeric. These proteins, evolutionary highly conserved, display a tissue- and cell-specific expression pattern, a characteristic they share with most other EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (e.g. troponin) but not with the multifunctional and ubiquitously expressed calmodulin (for review see Ref. 4Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). S100A1 is the most abundant S100 protein in striated muscle and has been shown to colocalize, in particular, with structures involved in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal as well as cardiac muscle (5Maco B.

Biochemical and biophysical studies, however, have indicated that S100A1 can physically interact with the purified sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor skeletal muscle isoform (RyR1) 1The abbreviations used are: RyR, release channel/ryanodine receptor; skeletal muscle isoform; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; Soleus, M. soleus; EDL, M. extensor digitorum longus; aa, amino acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance; N, N-terminal; H, hinge region; C, C-terminal; pCa, –log[Ca2+](M); SERCA, SR Ca2+-ATPase.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11496-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the molecular entity that is the key substrate for sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release in striated muscle. However, it was unclear whether S100A1/RyR1 interaction is able to enhance Ca2+ release from the intact SR to increase contractile performance in skeletal muscle fibers. We therefore sought to investigate the role of S100A1 protein in saponin-skinned slow-twitch (Musculus soleus, Soleus) and fast-twitch (Musculus extensor digitorum longus, EDL) murine skeletal muscle fibers maintaining structural and functional integrity of the SR and the contractile apparatus. This approach enabled us to assess the effect of S100A1 on SR Ca2+ release and the interplay between preserved SR and contractile apparatus function (13Endo M. Iino M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In general, S100 proteins consist of an N-terminal part containing a non-conventional Ca2+-binding site of the EF-hand (helix-loop-helix) type and a C-terminal part containing a canonical EF-hand. The two parts are interconnected by an intermediate region, the “hinge region,” and the C-terminal EF-hand is followed by a C-terminal extension. The hydrophobic hinge region and the C-terminal extension display the least amount of sequence identity among S100A1 members and are suggested to specify the biological activities of individual S100A1 proteins. S100 proteins typically display structural changes and exposure of hydrophobic surfaces upon Ca2+ binding, reminiscent of the sensor properties of calmodulin, to interact with their target proteins. Based on novel insights gathered from structural analysis of S100A1 protein (14Wang Z. Zhang H. Ding Y. Wang G. Wang X. Ye S. Bartlam M. Tang H. Liu Y. Jiang F. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Rao Z. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 882-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a S100A1 peptide model consisting of the region amino acids 2–16 (Fig. 1C, N-terminal (N)), amino acids 42–54 (Hinge-region (H)), and amino acids 75–94 (C-terminal (C)) devoid of Ca2+-binding motifs was synthesized to gain further insight into structure-function relationship of S100A1/RyR1 interaction as well as to exclude adverse Ca2+-buffering effects by the native protein (15Baudier J.

Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Taking advantage of chemically skinned skeletal muscle fibers, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that S100A1/RyR1 interaction can enhance SR Ca2+ release from the intact SR resulting in increased isometric force transients both in slow- and fast-twitch skeletal muscle. Importantly, S100A1 protein as well as the synthetic S100A1 peptide model (N/H/C) equally enhanced functional parameters, and these effects were found to be dose-dependent in a range of 0.001–10 μm. Further testing of single S100A1 domains identified the hydrophobic C-terminal extension (aa 75–94) as well as the hinge region (aa 42–54) to differentially affect SR function. These effects are apparently based on enhanced SR Ca2+ release as S100A1 neither influenced SR Ca2+ uptake nor myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity/cooperativity in skeletal muscle fibers in our experimental setting. Thus, our data suggest a putative physiological role for S100A1 to serve as an endogenous enhancer of SR Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle. Production of Recombinant Human S100A1 Protein and Synthetic Peptides—Recombinant human S100A1 protein was expressed and purified as previously described (17Ehlermann P. Remppis A. Most P.

Both S100A1 protein and peptides were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Muscle Fiber Preparation and Experimental Solutions—All of the animals were handled according to the guidelines of the animal care committee of the University of Heidelberg. Male BALB/c mice (3–6-months-old) were sacrificed by an overdose of carbon dioxide, and muscle fiber preparation was carried out as previously described (21Fink R.H. Stephenson D.G. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1987; 409: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Makabe M. Werner O. Fink R.H. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

Either EDL or Soleus was isolated, and a small fiber bundle containing two to four single fibers (between 80 and 150 μm in diameter and 3–4-mm-long) was dissected in paraffin oil. The fiber preparation was glued between a force transducer pin (AE801, Senso-Noras, Horton, Norway) and a micrometer-adjustable screw. All of the experiments were carried out at room temperature (23–25 °C). All of the solutions were adjusted to pH 7.0. The free ion concentrations were calculated with the computer program REACT (version 2.0) from G. L. Smith (Glasgow, Scotland). Table I shows the concentrations of the solution used in the experiments. The high relaxation and the high activation solution contained 50 mm EGTA to buffer free Ca2+, whereas the low relaxing solution contained 0.5 mm EGTA and 49.5 mm 1,6-diamino hexane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (HDTA), which in contrast to EGTA has very low affinity to Ca2+. The skinning solution is obtained by the addition of 50 μg/ml saponin to the low relaxing solution. The release solution consisted of the low relaxing solution with 5 mm caffeine added. Loading solution contained 50 mm EGTA to clamp free Ca2+ to 0.4 μm (pCa 6.4). The solutions to measure the pCa-force relation were obtained by mixing high relaxing solution with appropriate amounts of high activating solution, and 5 mm caffeine added. All of the experiments were recorded using a strip chart recorder and were simultaneously digitally converted with an Axon Instruments Digidata 1200 board and interface (using the Axotape Software, version 2.0) and stored on the computer (22Makabe M.

Werner O. Fink R.H. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Before loading the SR with the loading solution (pCa 6.4) for 1 min, the fibers were shortly immersed in release solution and high relaxing solution and then equilibrated for 2 min in low relaxing solution. Subsequently, the preparation was dipped for 1 s into the high relaxing solution and again for 2 min in low relaxing solution. The fibers were exposed to the release solution containing 5 mm caffeine until the initial force transient returned to the resting force level. Maximum force was measured in the high activating solution at pCa 4.28 and 5 mm caffeine. The fibers then were relaxed in high relaxing solution for 1 min to buffer Ca2+. Several control transients were recorded before the fiber was exposed to S100A1, and the experiment was repeated as outlined above. S100A1 protein or peptides were added to the low relaxing solution before and during release and to the high activating solution (22Makabe M. Werner O. Fink R.H. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pCa-force relation in response to S100A1 interventions (0.001–10 μm) was measured with six different Ca2+ concentrations (EDL, pCa 9.07, 5.91, 5.72, 5.49, 5.17, and 4.28; Soleus, pCa 9.07, 5.72, 5.49, 5.35, 5.17, and 4.28), each containing 5 mm caffeine. The EC50 and the Hill coefficient were obtained from a Hill-type fit (23Fink R.H. Stephenson D.G. Williams D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 420: 337-353Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The EC50 value indicates the Ca2+ concentration needed for half-maximal isometric force activation, which is as a measure of Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. The Hill coefficient gives an indication of the maximum steepness of the sigmoidal curve. The correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the accuracy of the fit. The force transient was transformed into the corresponding free Ca2+ transient by using the individual pCa2+ force relation as a Ca2+ indicator and reversing each point of the force transients into the corresponding free Ca2+ level as previously described (22Makabe M. Werner O. Fink R.H. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Uttenweiler D. Weber C. Fink R.H. Biophys.

Based on the fact that sensitivity of the Ca2+-regulatory proteins and the corresponding force development directly provide a measure of the free myofibrillar Ca2+, the pCa force relation relates free Ca2+ and force. Thus, the pCa-force relation can be used as a bioassay, which converts the rather slow force transients from the Ca2+ release from the SR into apparent Ca2+ transients (22Makabe M. Werner O.

Sarcoplasmic Ca2+ Uptake in EDL SR Vesicles—EDL muscles from hind legs of male Balb/c mice (3–6 months) were dissected and used for SR vesicle preparation as previously published (26Chu A. Dixon M.C. Saito A. Seiler S. Fleischer S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SR vesicle protein content was measured using the DM™ protein assay (Bio-Rad), and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Sarcoplasmic Ca2+ uptake was measured as described elsewhere (27Smith G.L. Duncan A.M. Neary P. Bruce L. Burton F.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H577-H585Google Scholar). EDL SR vesicles (100 μg) were suspended in a 1.5-ml reaction solution (in mm: 120 KCl, 5 MgATP, 15 CrP, 1 MgCl, 25 HEPES, 20 K2Oxalate, 0.05 K2EGTA, pH 7.0) and equilibrated with 0.01 mm Fura-2 (Sigma) and 5 μm ruthenium while stirring in a cuvette (1.5 ml). Ca2+ uptake measurements were started after the addition of 67 μm CaCl2, resulting in an increase in free [Ca2+] from ∼100 nm to 1μm. The consequent decline of Fura-2 fluorescence ratio (340:380 nm) was a reflection of SR Ca2+ uptake, and the fluorescence ratio was recorded at 30 Hz using a spinning wheel spectrophotometer (Cairn Research). The low pass filtered (–3 db at 30 Hz) signal was digitized and stored for later analysis. Ca2+ uptake rate (dCa2+/dt; pmol Ca2+/s) for 100 μg of SR protein was obtained from the time constant (τ) of extrasarcoplasmic [Ca2+] decline. τ was achieved from best-fit single-exponential decay from experiments where free [Ca2+]i in the cuvette is exceeding 1 μm. The relationship between given Ca2+ concentrations and the resulting fluorescence ratios was established with a series of calibration experiments and analyzed according to Grynkiewicz et al. (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca2+-binding constants were taken from Fabiato and Fabiato (29Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar) and Baudier et al. (15Baudier J. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For S100A1 interventions, SR vesicles were preincubated with either 1 or 10 μm S100A1 protein or peptides (N/H/C) for 30 min while S100A1 storage buffer served as control. S100A1 Immunoprecipitations—S100A1 protein levels in murine heart, EDL, and Soleus were assessed as previously described (30Ehlermann P. Redweik U. Blau N. Heizmann C.W. Katus H.A. Remppis A. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 2001; 20: 203-207PubMed Google Scholar). Either untreated or saponin-skinned cardiac myocytes EDL and Soleus fibers were homogenized at 4 °C in 3 w/v phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EGTA/EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (1836170, Complete Mini EDTA free, Roche Diagnostics) followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min). The suspensions were rotated with bovine serum albumin-treated A/G-Sepharose for 30 min and centrifuged (800 × g) to remove proteins bound nonspecifically to A/G-Sepharose. The supernatants were then mixed with A/G-Sepharose and precipitating antibody for S100A1 (SA 5632) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were rotated for 30 min and centrifuged (800 × g), and pellets were washed three times with a buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–20%), transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with affinity-purified polyclonal S100A1-Ab (DAKO A5109). Blots were developed with the Avidix chemiluminescence detection system (Tropix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and quantified by densitometry. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Unpaired Student's t test and a two-way repeated ANOVA analysis were performed to test for differences between groups. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Expression of Recombinant Human S100A1 Protein and Synthesis of S100A1 Peptides—Before studying the effect of S100A1 on contractile performance and SR function, it was important to demonstrate purity and integrity both of recombinantly expressed human S100A1 protein and synthetic S100A1 peptides. Purified S100A1 protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS, respectively. Fig. 1A depicts a representative silver staining of S100A1 preparations resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1A, purified S100A1 protein consisted of a pure single band migrating as a 10-kDa component without visuable contamination by other proteins. Accurate mass was determined by ESI-MS. The observed peak m/z ion values (10416.37 ± 0.35 Da, n = 5) correlated well with the calculated mass for human S100A1 protein C465H677-N114S3O153 (10,415 Da, Swiss Protein Data Bank number P23297) within the experimental error (0.01%). Specificity of the purified protein was examined by Western blotting. Immunodetection with anti-S100A1 antibody revealed one major band approximately at 10 kDa representing the S100A1 monomer (Fig. 1B). In addition, there was a second band of higher molecular mass migrating between 23 and 34 kDa, consistent with dimeric S100A1 aggregates (Fig. 1B, double asterisk). Although it has been reported that even application of high concentrations of the Ca2+-binding protein S100A1 protein (∼80 μm) to EGTA-buffered Ca2+ solutions caused no change in free Ca2+ concentration (31Adhikari B.B. Wang K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we sought to introduce a synthetic S100A1 peptide model devoid of Ca2+-binding motifs both to exclude any artificial lowering of the free Ca2+ concentration by S100A1 protein in our experimental setting and to gain further insight into structure-function relationship of S100A1 effects. Amino acid sequence alignment displayed in Fig. 1C compares S100A1 peptides defined by residues 2–16 (N-terminal (N)), 42–54 (Hinge-region (H)), and 75–94 (C-terminal (C)) to the human S100A1 protein primary sequence. The selected peptides encompass nearly 50% of the protein, however, omitting both EF-hand Ca2+-binding domains. Fig. 1D exhibits a representative silver staining of the three S100A1 peptides resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, visualizing the high purity that was confirmed by analytical reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis (data not shown). Molecular weight was determined by the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy. Peak signals yielded in the mass spectrum (N, 1653.26 ± 0.52 Da; H, 1376.17 ± 0.39 Da; C, 2257.10 ± 0.19; n = 5) were nearly identical to the calculated peptide mass (N, 1652 Da; H, 1377 Da; and C, 2258 Da). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous S100A1 protein levels in murine cardiomyocyte, EDL, and Soleus muscle preparations visualized both by silver staining (Fig. 1E, upper panel) and Western blotting (Fig. 1E, lower panel) confirmed both differential S100A1 expression levels in murine heart (16.87 ± 1.22 densitometric arbitrary units; 100%), Soleus (6.56 ± 0.89 densitometric arbitrary units; 38% compared with heart), and EDL (0.72 ± 0.04 densitometric arbitrary units; 4.26% compared with heart) as well as S100A1 depletion of striated muscle following saponin treatment. S100A1 monomer and dimer are indicated by single and double asterisks, respectively. S100A1 Increases Caffeine-induced SR Ca2+ Release and Ca2+-induced Isometric Force Transients in Murine EDL and Soleus Muscle Fibers—S100A1 has been reported to be mainly found in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, whereas fast-twitch muscle fibers contain lower amounts of S100A1 protein (6Zimmer D.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Haimoto H. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which could be confirmed by S100A1 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1E). Since S100A1 has been shown to interact with the SR Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR1) reconstituted in lipid bilayers (12Treves S. Scutari E. Robert M. Groh S. Ottolia M. Prestipino G. Ronjat M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11496-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we were interested whether S100A1/RyR1 interaction can modulate SR function and contractile properties of skeletal muscle fibers. To gain direct diffusional access for S100A1 protein and peptides to the myoplasm and its target proteins, the sarcolemma from small EDL and Soleus muscle bundles was rendered permeable by saponin treatment, thus leaving the SR and the contractile apparatus fully intact (24Uttenweiler D. Weber C. Fink R.H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1640-1653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Importantly, saponin treatment resulted in significant depletion of endogenous S100A1 protein levels both in EDL and Soleus muscle preparations (Fig. 1E). According to previous biophysical approaches (12Treves S. Scutari E. Robert M. Groh S. Ottolia M. Prestipino G. Ronjat M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11496-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we first investigated SR Ca2+ efflux in response to acute application or preincubation (2 min) both of S100A1 protein and synthetic S100A1 peptides (N/H/C) in our experimental setting. Interestingly, in the presence of 0.5 mm free Mg2+ that is believed to inhibit channel opening by occupying the site for calcium activation of the RyR (33Lacampagne A. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) S100A1 interventions failed to directly elicit SR Ca2+ release both in Soleus and EDL skeletal muscle preparations. Therefore, we decided to investigate the impact of S100A1 on activated RyR-mediated SR Ca2+ release using caffeine. Caffeine was chosen to initiate RyR1 opening for its ability to increase Ca2+ sensitivity of the Ca2+ activation site on the SR Ca2+ release channel without appreciably affecting channel subconductance and sensitivity to endogenous regulators (e.g. ATP) (34Lamb G.D. Cellini M.A. Stephenson D.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 715-728Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), which can be seen in the bell-shaped curve of channel activation versus [Ca2+] as a leftward shift of the ascending (activation) arm of the curve with little change in the descending (inhibition) limb (36Meissner G. Rios E. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1628-1638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

In a wide range of animal clock structures, ERK plays an important role in the circadian time-keeping mechanism. Here we found that immunoreactivity to p38 protein was uniformly distributed among cells in the chick pineal gland. On the other hand, a constant level of activated p38 was detected over the day, predominantly in the follicular and parafollicular pinealocytes that are potential circadian clock-containing cells. Chronic application of SB203580, a selective and reversible inhibitor of p38, to the cultured chick pineal cells markedly lengthened the period of the circadian rhythm of the melatonin release (up to 28.7 h). Noticeably, despite no significant temporal change of activated p38 level, a 4-h pulse treatment with SB203580 delayed the phase of the rhythm only when delivered during the subjective day. These results indicate a time-of-day-specific role of continuously activated p38 in the period length regulation of the chick pineal clock and suggest temporally separated regulation of the clock by two MAPKs, nighttime-activated ERK and daytime-working p38.

In a variety of organisms, daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are controlled by circadian clocks, which oscillate with a period of ∼24 h under constant conditions. These clocks are entrained to environmental time cues such as light and temperature (1Pittendrigh C.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 16-54Google Scholar). Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that the circadian oscillators in Drosophila and mice share similar positive and negative regulators forming transcription/translation-based feedback loops (2Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a complex of basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factors, dCLOCK and CYCLE (dBMAL1), positively regulates transcription of both period (per) and timeless (tim) genes (3Rutila J.E. Suri V. Lee M. So W.V. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1998; 93: 805-814Google Scholar, 4Darlington T.K. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani M.F. Staknis D. Gekakis N. Steeves T.D. Weitz C.J. Takahashi J.S. Kay S.A.

The complex of PER and TIM inhibits dCLOCK:CYCLE-mediated transcription (4Darlington T.K. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani M.F. Staknis D. Gekakis N. Steeves T.D. Weitz C.J. Takahashi J.S. Kay S.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1599-1603Google Scholar), and thus they act as negative elements of the feedback loop in which the mRNA and protein levels of these negative elements oscillate in a circadian manner. It is now postulated that the molecular framework of the circadian oscillator is conserved from flies to mammals, although some of the clock components appear to play slightly different roles (2Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Google Scholar). In addition to the transcriptional and translational regulation, posttranslational events such as protein phosphorylation regulate the circadian clock functions. In Drosophila, DOUBLETIME, a homologue of mammalian casein kinase Iϵ (CKIϵ), 1The abbreviations used are: CKIϵ, casein kinase Iϵ; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; LD, 12-h light/12-h dark; CT, circadian time; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; ATF, activating transcription factor; CHOP, C/E-box-binding protein homologous protein; MAPKAPK, MAPK-activated protein kinase. reduces the stability of PER by phosphorylation (6Price J.L.

Cell. 2001; 105: 769-779Google Scholar). Missense alleles of double-time or shaggy gene result in alteration of the period length of the circadian rhythm (6Price J.L. Blau J. Rothenfluh A.

Evidence for a similar role of CKI in the mammalian clock system is also presented. That is, CKIϵ (and CKIδ) regulates subcellular localization and stability of PER proteins by phosphorylation (9Lee C. Etchegaray J.P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M.

Ralph M.R. Menaker M. Takahashi J.S. Science. 2000; 288: 483-492Google Scholar). In addition to PER proteins, the positive regulators such as BMAL1 and CLOCK also seem to be phosphorylated in vivo (9Lee C. Etchegaray J.P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies showed that CKI and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a member of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) family, phosphorylate BMAL1 and regulate BMAL1:CLOCK-mediated transactivation (15Eide E.J. Vielhaver E.L. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17248-17254Google Scholar, 16Sanada K. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 267-271Google Scholar). Interestingly, ERK activity exhibits circadian rhythm in various clock-containing structures (17Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Google Scholar, 18Sanada K. Hayashi Y.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 255-266Google Scholar), and transient inhibition of the nighttime-activation of ERK induces a phase shift of the clock in the chicken pineal gland and bullfrog retina (18Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Google Scholar, 19Harada Y. Sanada K. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37078-37085Google Scholar), suggesting important contribution of ERK to the clockworks. p38 is another member of the MAPK family and was originally identified as stress-activated protein kinase (21Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Google Scholar). It should be noted that the circadian rhythm of the chick pineal cells is perturbed by various cellular stresses such as osmotic stress and temperature shifts (22Zatz M. Wang H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R769-R776Google Scholar, 23Zatz M. Wang H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R1424-R1430Google Scholar, 24Zatz M. Lange G.D. Rollag M.D. Am. J.

Therefore, we directed our attention to p38 and found that a constant amount of activated p38 was present in the follicular and parafollicular pinealocytes throughout a day. We further investigated the role of p38 in the cultured chicken pineal cells using SB203580, a specific and reversible inhibitor of p38 (26Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar, 27Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Google Scholar). We found that SB203580 treatment dramatically lengthens the free-running period of the melatonin secretion rhythm. Importantly, the phase-delaying effect of SB203580 was observed only during the subjective day, and this sharply contrasts to the nighttime-specific phase-delaying effect of PD98059, an inhibitor for ERK activation (18Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Google Scholar). We concluded that p38 is the daytime-working accelerator of the chick pineal clock. Animals—Animals were treated in accordance with the guidelines of The University of Tokyo. Newly hatched male chicks were purchased from local suppliers and raised under 12-h light/12-h dark (LD) lighting conditions with the light intensity of 300 lux at the level of the head of the chick. Immunoblot Analyses of the Pineal Gland—Pineal glands isolated from eight chicks were lysed in 500 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. This procedure for the dark-period sample was performed under dim red light (>640 nm). The sample was subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p38 antibody (1:1000 dilution, New England Biolabs) that detects the dually phosphorylated form of p38. The protein levels of p38 were evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-p38 antibody (1:5000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the immunoreactivities were developed by CDP-Star detection system (New England Biolabs) with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution, New England Biolabs). The immunopositive band density was quantitated by densitometric analysis using MacBAS 2.5 software (Fuji film). Immunohistochemistry—The chick pineal glands were isolated under dim red light (>640 nm) and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na-phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 for 1 h at 4 °C. Then the tissues were cryoprotected with 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in the OCT-mounting medium (Sakura). The frozen sections (10-μm thickness) were incubated with a blocking solution (5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with a primary antibody diluted in the blocking solution followed by incubation for 48 h at 4 °C with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution, Molecular Probes) diluted in the blocking solution. The primary antibodies used were anti-phospho-p38 antibody (1:30 dilution, New England Biolabs) or anti-p38 antibody (1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). TO-PRO-3 (0.2 μm, Molecular Probes) was used for staining of cell nuclei. The sections were viewed by a confocal laserscanning microscope (TCS-NT, Leica). Quantification of Melatonin Released from Cultured Chick Pineal Cells—The pineal glands isolated from 1-day-old chicks were mechanically disrupted by passing through a nylon mesh (pore size 100 μm), and the cells were dispersed in Medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin G (Meiji), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Meiji), 3 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (Kojin), 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), and 2.2 mg/ml NaHCO3. Pineal cells were plated onto 24-well plates (Cloning Plate number 704160, Greiner) at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well and cultured at 39.5 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air in an incubator equipped with a fluorescent lamp (300 lux at dish level). The cultured cells were kept in LD cycles from the day of plating (day 1), and the culture medium was exchanged at zeitgeber time 11 (zeitgeber time 0 is lights on, and zeitgeber time 12 is lights off) on days 3 and 5. On day 6, the culture was transferred to constant darkness, and the culture medium was exchanged at 4-h intervals under infrared light (>800 nm) with the aid of dark-field goggles (NEC) for determination of the secreted melatonin concentration in the medium. Melatonin in the culture medium was separated and quantified by using NANOSPACE SI-1 high pressure liquid chromatography system (Shiseido) as described previously (18Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Google Scholar). The phase of the rhythm of secreted melatonin levels was represented by the phase reference point (28Robertson L.M. Takahashi J.S. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 12-21Google Scholar, 29Robertson L.M. Takahashi J.S. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 22-30Google Scholar), which was defined for each peak as the time midway between the half-rise and half-fall of the peak. The half-rise point was calculated by interpolating the two time points that gave (i) the lowest melatonin concentration preceding the peak of the cycle and (ii) the peak melatonin concentration of the cycle. The half-fall point was calculated by interpolating the two time points that gave (i) the peak melatonin concentration and (ii) the lowest melatonin concentration following the peak of the cycle. The period length of a cycle was defined as the time between two consecutive phase reference points. For every individual culture, two consecutive period lengths were calculated form the first three cycles and they were averaged to determine the period length for that culture. The period lengths thus determined for three replicate cultures of one treatment group were averaged to determine the mean period length of the treatment group. The phase angles of the three cultures within a treatment group were averaged for the second and third cycle following the drug treatment. The mean phase angle of the treatment group was subtracted from that of the control group to determine the magnitude of the phase shift. Preparation of Lysate of Cultured Chick Pineal Cells—Pineal cells were plated onto 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 4.4 × 105 cells/well and cultured as described above. The cells were treated with either SB203580 (in 0.1% Me2SO) or 0.1% Me2SO (vehicle) from CT2 or CT14 on day 6 (see “Results and Discussion”). After 4-h treatment, cells were lysed immediately with 120 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and the lysate was then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-CREB antibody (1:1000 dilution, New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-ATF-2 antibody (1:500 dilution, New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-MAPKAPK2 antibody (1:250 dilution, New England Biolabs), or anti-MAPKAPK2 antibody (1:500 dilution, New England Biolabs). The immunoreactive signals were developed by Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution, Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). Activity of p38 in the Chick Pineal Gland—Various cellular stresses are known to perturb the circadian rhythm of melatonin release from the chick pineal cells in culture (22Zatz M. Wang H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R769-R776Google Scholar, 23Zatz M. Wang H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R1424-R1430Google Scholar, 24Zatz M. Lange G.D. Rollag M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R50-R58Google Scholar, 25Barrett R.K. Takahashi J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5681-5692Google Scholar). The phase-response curves to high temperature treatment and osmotic stress resemble that to the photic stimulation (22Zatz M. Wang H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R769-R776Google Scholar, 24Zatz M. Lange G.D. Rollag M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R50-R58Google Scholar, 25Barrett R.K. Takahashi J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5681-5692Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the photic entrainment of the pineal clock may share signaling molecule(s) with the stress signaling pathway. We first evaluated a light-dependent change of the chick pineal p38 activity by using the anti-phospho-p38 antibody specific to the active form of p38 (that is phosphorylated on both regulatory threonine and tyrosine residues). Chicks entrained to LD cycles were transferred to constant darkness, and the pineal glands were isolated before and after the light exposure (300 lux) of the animals at CT6, CT14, or CT18 (CT0 and CT12 refer to the times of lights on and off in the previous LD cycle, respectively). At CT6, light exposure caused ∼2-fold increase of active p38 level within 10 min, which then returned to the basal level within 30 min (Fig. 1A, top and bottom panels). The protein levels of chick pineal p38 were almost constant before and after the light exposure (Fig. 1A, middle panel). The light stimulation at CT14 (Fig. 1B) or CT18 (Fig. 1C) had an effect similar to that observed at CT6 (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that p38 was phosphorylated and activated transiently after receiving light at any time of the day tested. In the light-stimulation experiment, we noticed that a certain level of active p38 was present in the pineal gland of the chicks kept in the dark (prior to light stimulation) at CT6, CT14, and CT18 (Fig. 1). This result led us to examine circadian variation in levels of active p38 in constant dark condition. Chicks entrained to LD cycles were transferred to constant darkness, and the pineal glands were isolated at 4-h intervals over a day. As shown in Fig. 2A, a constant amount of active p38 was detected in the pineal homogenate prepared at every time point, and the total amount of p38 protein showed no detectable change during the period. To examine the cellular distribution of active p38 and its possible temporal change, thin sections of the pineal gland were prepared from the chicks maintained in constant darkness and they were subjected to immunostaining with the antibodies to p38 protein and to its phosphorylated form. Between the two time points tested (CT6 and CT18), no significant difference was observed in distribution of either p38 protein (Fig. 2B, top row) or its active form (third row). Interestingly, p38 protein was detected in almost all of the pineal cells, whereas the active form of p38 was detected in cells within the follicles but not in the interfollicular cells (designated IF in Fig. 2B). Each follicle was composed of two types of active p38-immunopositive cells forming concentric cell layers. In the inner layer (follicular layer; Fig. 2B, F), follicular pinealocytes protrude their rudimentary outer segments into the lumen (Fig. 2B, L), and parafollicular pinealocytes in the outer layer (parafollicular layer; Fig. 2B, PF) surround the follicular pinealocytes. It was previously shown that both of the pinealocytes have photoreceptor pinopsin (30Okano T. Yoshizawa T. Fukada Y. Nature. 1994; 372: 94-97Google Scholar, 31Okano T. Takanaka Y. Nakamura A. Hirunagi K. Adachi A. Ebihara S. Fukada Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 50: 190-196Google Scholar) and enzymes in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway such as N-acetyltransferase and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase, which are known to colocalize with the circadian pacemaker (32Greve P. Voisin P. Grechez-Cassiau A. Bernard M. Collin J.P. Guerlotte J. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 803-806Google Scholar, 33Bernard M. Iuvone P.M. Cassone V.M. Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 213-224Google Scholar, 34Nakahara K. Murakami N. Nasu T. Kuroda H. Murakami T. Brain Res. 1997; 774: 242-245Google Scholar). Taken together, it was suggested that a constant amount of p38 is kept activated in the pineal clock-containing photosensitive cells. Effect of SB203580 on the Circadian Rhythms of Melatonin Release—To explore a possible contribution of continuously activated p38 to the pineal clockwork, we examined how chronic inhibition of p38 activity alters the free-running rhythm of the melatonin release. For this purpose, we used SB203580, a specific and reversible inhibitor of p38 (26Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar, 27Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Google Scholar). The cultured pineal cells were treated with SB203580 continuously from CT2 in constant darkness. Application of 10 μm SB203580 induced a free-running rhythm with a prolonged period of 25.2 ± 0.7 h, and application of 30 μm SB203580 remarkably deformed the rhythm with an apparent period length of 28.7 ± 1.1 h (Fig. 3, A and B). On the other hand, the free-running period of Me2SO-treated cells and that of nontreated cells were both close to 24 h (24.3 ± 0.8 h and 24.0 ± 0.3 h, respectively, Fig. 3B). We concluded that p38 plays a crucial role in maintenance of the period length of the pineal clock. Our observations together suggest that p38 may have a continuous phase-advancing effect on the clock over the day. To test this idea, we examined the effect of 4-h pulse treatment with SB203580 on the clock. The cultured cells treated with 30 μm SB203580 during the early subjective day (CT2–6) exhibited a rhythm delayed by 2.6 ± 0.8 h (Figs. 4A and 5) as compared with non-treated control cells, and the drug treatment at the late subjective day (CT610) induced a smaller phase delay by 1.8 ± 0.3 h (Figs. 4B and 5). Noticeably, the drug treatment during the subjective night (CT14–18 and CT18–22) had a minimal effect, if any, on the melatonin rhythm (Figs. 4, D and E, and 5). The phase-dependent phase-delaying effect of SB203580 was also dependent on the concentration of the drug (Fig. 5). This all-delay phase-response curve is consistent with the period-lengthening effect of chronic application of the drug (Fig. 3) and indicates a daytime-specific function of p38 in the clock regulation.Fig. 5Phase-response curves for the pulse application of SB203580. The phase shift was calculated from the difference in phase angle of the melatonin rhythm between the untreated and treated cell culture, which was exposed to 0.1% Me2SO (open circles) and 10 or 30 μm SB203580 in 0.1% Me2SO (solid triangles or squares, respectively) for 4 h from the indicated time point. Each value is mean ± S.E. of three replicate culture wells. The magnitudes of the phase advance or delay are shown as positive or negative values, respectively. Significance of the difference in magnitude of the phase shift between SB203580-treated cells and Me2SO-treated cells at each time point was determined by using two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test.

Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Google Scholar), which could be candidates to transmit the p38 signal to the core feedback loop in the chicken pineal circadian oscillator. By using active (phosphorylated) form-specific anti-bodies, we examined the phosphorylation states of CREB, ATF-2, and MAPKAPK2 in the lysate of the cultured pineal cells that had been treated with 10 or 30 μm SB203580 at CT2–6 (daytime treatment) or CT14–18 (nighttime treatment) (Fig. 6). In control cultures (vehicle treated with 0.1% Me2SO), certain amounts of the three proteins were found to be in the phosphorylated state at CT6 and CT18 (Fig. 6, upper three row panels, lane 0) and no significant difference was observed in phosphorylation level of each protein between the two time points. In both phases, the 4-h treatment with 10 or 30 μm SB203580 had no measurable effect on the phosphorylation states of pineal CREB (top row panels) and ATF-2 (second row panels). On the other hand, the phosphorylated form of MAPKAPK2 became almost undetectable after 4-h treatment at both time periods with the drug not only at 30 μm but also at 10 μm (third row panels) with its protein level unaltered upon the drug treatment (bottom panels). These results strongly suggest pineal MAPKAPK2 as a downstream target of p38 and support the presence of continuously activated p38 in the cultured cells, similar to in vivo situation (Fig. 2A). However, the results obtained do not account for the phase-dependent effect of SB203580. Also, apparently complete inhibition of MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation caused by the lower concentration (10 μm) of SB203580 (Fig. 6) is at odds with the dose-dependent effect of SB203580 on the period length (Fig. 5). These issues appear to argue against a role of MAPKAPK2 in the clock regulation, but we should note the difference in experimental design between the rhythm measurement (Figs. 4 and 5) and the phosphorylation state assay (Fig. 6). The latter is the evaluation of the final state of MAPKAPK2 phosphorylation after 4-h drug treatment, whereas the former reflects the sum of accumulative effect of the drug on phosphorylation inhibition processes that would proceed progressively during 4-h treatment. Because it is difficult to compare accurately ongoing phosphorylation inhibition processes under various conditions (daytime versus nighttime treatment, 10 versus 30 μm drug), it remains to be elucidated whether or not MAPKAPK2 may play an important role in the clock period regulation. A Role of p38 in the Pineal Clockwork—In this study, we demonstrated that chronic treatment of the cultured chick pineal cells with p38 inhibitor (SB203580) dramatically lengthened the period length of the circadian rhythm of melatonin release (Fig. 3). Despite the presence of continuously activated p38 in the follicular and parafollicular cells (Fig. 2), the phase-delaying effect of SB203580 was observed only when applied during the subjective day (Figs. 4 and 5). We speculate that the time-of-day-specific effect of SB203580 could be attributed to a temporal fluctuation (in amount and/or distribution) of the downstream target of p38. As described above, SB203580 treatment significantly reduced the amount of phosphorylated MAPKAPK2. However, similar amounts of phosphorylated MAPKAPK2 were detected at CT6 and CT18, and SB203580 treatment decreased the phosphorylation level in a phase-in-dependent manner (Fig. 6, third row panels). Given that MAPKAPK2 contributes to the clock regulation, the amount or distribution of a substrate downstream of MAPKAPK2 would change in a circadian manner. Alternatively, p38 might phosphorylate and regulate other molecule(s) such as myocyte enhancer factor 2C, CHOP, or a component of the feedback loop of the oscillator. In clock-containing cells, activities and/or protein levels of several clock gene products exhibit prominent circadian rhythms (2Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Google Scholar). In the chick pineal gland, the mRNA level of Per2 gene peaks at CT2 and decreases during the subjective day (36Okano T. Yamamoto K. Okano K. Hirota T. Kasahara T. Sasaki M. Takanaka Y. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 825-836Google Scholar). Because the transcription of Per2 gene is positively regulated by BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer (36Okano T. Yamamoto K. Okano K. Hirota T. Kasahara T. Sasaki M. Takanaka Y. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 825-836Google Scholar), the transactivation by BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer should be declining or suppressed in the late subjective day in the pineal gland. Therefore, it is possible that p38 or MAPKAPK2 accelerates the decline of BMAL1:CLOCK transactivation by phosphorylating the complex of these positive regulators and thereby advances the clock phase. Likewise, p38 or MAPKAPK2 may phosphorylate the negative elements, PER and CRY (37Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 193-205Google Scholar), to enhance their ability to inhibit the transactivation of BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer. Downstream molecules of p38 or MAPKAPK2 in the pineal gland are to be investigated for understanding how p38 regulates the circadian oscillatory mechanism in the clock system. We previously demonstrated that the inhibition of ERK activity delayed the phase of the clock during the subjective night (18Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Google Scholar), a period when SB203580 application had almost no effect on the pineal clock (Figs. 4 and 5). In addition, ERK is activated during the nighttime and it is rapidly dephosphorylated by light stimulation in the night (18Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Google Scholar). This contrasts with light-induced activation of p38 (Fig. 1). Such a contrasting control of ERK and p38 signaling pathways may be important for the proper clockwork in the chick pineal gland. Considering the strong evolutionary conservation of the MAPK family in vertebrates (38Martin-Blanco E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 637-645Google Scholar), it will be of great interest to compare the molecular frameworks of the signaling mediated by ERK and p38 in other vertebrate clock systems. We thank Dr. Toshiyuki Okano for insightful discussion."

IL-1-induced ERK activation is markedly diminished in fibroblasts deprived of focal adhesions whereas activation of p38 and JNK is unaffected. While IL-1 signaling is known to involve the activity of protein and lipid kinases including MAP kinases, FAK, and PI3K, little is known about the role of phosphatases in the regulation of IL-1 signal generation and attenuation. Here we demonstrate that SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase present in focal adhesions, modulates IL-1-induced ERK activation and the transient actin stress fiber disorganization that occurs following IL-1 treatment in human gingival fibroblasts. Using a combination of immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunostaining we show that SHP-2 is present in nascent focal adhesions and undergoes phosphorylation on tyrosine 542 in response to IL-1 stimulation. Blocking anti-SHP-2 antibodies, electoporated into the cytosol of fibroblasts, inhibited IL-1-induced ERK activation, actin filament assembly, and cell contraction, indicating a role for SHP-2 in these processes.

Gingival fibroblasts and chondrocytes are cells involved in inflammatory disorders that require focal adhesion complex (FAC) formation in vitro for IL-1-induced ERK activation (23Lo Y.Y. Luo L.

FAC are adhesive domains that comprise the termini of actin stress fibers in physical association with a number of actin-binding proteins including vinculin, talin, filamin A, paxillin, and α-actinin (29Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Nascent focal adhesions also contain a number of signaling molecules including p125 focal adhesion kinase, PI3K, Ras, Raf-1, MEK1, ERK, and JNK in addition to several growth factor and cytokine receptors, indicating a pivotal role for FAC in receptor-mediated signaling (30Miyamoto S.

Notably, in human gingival fibroblasts, the density of IL-1 receptors is highest in the vicinity of FAC (21Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Qwarnstrom E.E. Page R.C. Gillis S. Dower S.K. J. Biol.

Further, IL-1-induced phosphorylation of ERK and focal adhesion kinase, which are necessary for IL-1-induced Ca2+ flux, do not occur in the absence of FACs and the NF-κB response to IL-1 is enhanced by FAC (24Zhu P. Xiong W. Rodgers G. Qwarnstrom E.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that FAC are critical for the propagation and regulation of IL-RI-mediated ERK activation. In addition to FAC, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for IL-1-induced ERK activation (28MacGillivray M.K. Cruz T.F. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23509-23515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may be linked causally as the increased density of actin filaments in FAC may provide a scaffold that directs precise interactions between actin filaments and receptor-associated signaling molecules (36Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The interdependence between the actin cytoskeleton and IL-1 signaling is also supported by observations showing that IL-1 induces a transient cell contraction and disorganization of the actin filament network (24Zhu P. Xiong W. Rodgers G. Qwarnstrom E.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The regulation of chemical and mechanical signals, such as ERK activation and actin stress fiber organization, respectively, is achieved in part by a precise balance of kinase and phosphatase activities. SHP-2 is a Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in focal adhesion and stress fiber remodeling. Cells lacking functional SHP-2 have greater actin stress fiber density, exhibit increased numbers of FAC, have a stronger attachment to fibronectin and demonstrate reduced cell migration (37Inagaki K.

Although the catalytic domain of SHP-2 is required for actin binding, its phosphatase activity is apparently not, indicating a functionally important adaptor role for the catalytic domain (40Xu F. Zhao R. Peng Y. Guerrah A. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29479-29484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). SHP-2 is an important mediator of integrin, growth factor, and cytokine receptor-mediated activation of Ras and in turn ERK (41Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5208-5213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Notably, SHP-2 is involved in PDGF-induced ERK activation in fibroblasts grown on fibronectin (44DeMali K.A. Balciunaite E. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19551-19558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Following binding to the phosphorylated PDGF receptor, SHP-2 acts as an adaptor by mediating the association of PDGF-R with the Grb-2-Sos complex via its SH2 domains, leading to the activation of Ras and ERK. This positive regulatory effect is potentiated in cells plated on fibronectin, conditions that promote focal adhesion formation. Evidently, SHP-2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of growth factor and cytokine-induced ERK activation, in part by interacting with and perhaps modulating focal adhesions and associated proteins. However, the mechanisms by which SHP-2 regulates cytokine-induced signal generation and attenuation are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that SHP-2 is present in focal adhesions in fibroblasts from mechanically active environments and modulates IL-1-induced ERK activation and the transient actin stress fiber disorganization that occurs following IL-1 receptor engagement. We propose that the adaptor functions of SHP-2 may be important in mediating these processes.

Polyclonal antibodies to phosphoserine were from Zymed Laboratoratories (South San Francisco, CA). Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cell Culture and Bead Preparations—Human gingival fibroblasts were grown in minimal essential medium (α-MEM). Murine SHP-2 -/-(SHP-2(Δ46–110)) fibroblasts, and the NIH 3T3 cells were grown in high glucose DME. All media contained 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (0.17% penicillin V, 0.1% gentamicin sulfate, and 0.01% amphotericin). Cells were used between the 5th and 12th passages as previously described (28MacGillivray M.K. Cruz T.F. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23509-23515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Magnetite beads were added to acid-solubilized collagen (3 mg/ml, pH < 1.0) or poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml) and vortexed. NaOH was added to the collagen solution to a final concentration of 0.1 m to equilibrate pH to 7.4. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The beads were then washed several times, resuspended in PBS, and sonicated for 10 s (output setting 3, power 15%). To coat beads with BSA, beads were added to a solution of PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA, vortexed for 30 s, incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, washed three times, and resuspended in PBS. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (wild type, SHP-2(Δ46–110), and SHP-2(Δ46–110) reconstituted with wild-type murine SHP-2) were generated and grown as previously described (50Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M.

Isolation of Focal Adhesions—Cells were grown to 80–90% confluence on 60-mm tissue culture dishes and subsequently were cooled to 4 °C prior to the addition of collagen-coated or BSA-coated magnetite beads. FACs were isolated from dishes after various incubation time periods as described (45Plopper G. Ingber D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound beads and scraped into ice-cold cytoskeleton extraction buffer (CSKB; 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8). The cell-bead suspension was sonicated for 10 s (output setting 3, power 15% Branson), and the beads were isolated from the lysate using a magnetic separation stand. The beads were resuspended in fresh ice-cold CKSB, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes) and re-isolated magnetically. The beads were washed in CSKB, sedimented with a microcentrifuge, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min to allow the collagen-associated complexes to dissociate from the beads. The beads were sedimented and the lysate collected for analysis. Immunoblotting—The protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% acrylamide), resolved by electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C in a Tris-buffered saline solution with 5% milk to block nonspecific binding sites. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies for a minimum of 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20. Horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% milk. Labeled proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Chamber slides (8-well; Labtek) were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml in PBS). Cells were plated and allowed to spread for 24 h prior to treatment. Following treatment cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, blocked and permeabilized in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% BSA for 15 min at room temperature. Antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% BSA. Immunofluorescence staining for vinculin, IRAK, and SHP-2 was performed with monoclonal anti-vinculin, rabbit anti-IRAK, or rabbit anti-SHP-2 antibody (1:50, 1:20, and 1:50 dilutions, respectively) for 1 h at room temperature or 3 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed with PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated antibody (1:50 dilution) for 60 min at 4 °C, washed, and sealed with a coverslip. The slides were viewed with a Nikon 300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with Nomarski optics. Images were captured digitally using C-Imaging (Compix Imaging, Philadelphia, PA). Immunoprecipitation—Cells that had attained 80–90% confluence on 100-mm tissue culture dishes in normal growth medium were washed three times in ice cold PBS and 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4,) was added to each dish. The cell lysates were scraped into a microcentrifuge tube and rotated for 10 min at 4 °C. The tubes were then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant transferred to new tubes. 30 μl/ml agarose-conjugated rabbit polyclonal SHP-2 was added to the lysates, and the tubes were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The tubes were then centrifuged for 2 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and then the beads and associated proteins were resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and the eluted proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—Complexes of anti-SHP-2 antibody prebound to protein A/G Plus-Agarose beads were added to the cleared supernatant. The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, after which the beads were separated and extensively washed. One-fifth of the bead volume was removed and used for immunoblot analysis by resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The blots were probed with monoclonal anti-SHP2 antibody followed by washing and then incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat-anti mouse antibody. The remaining beads were sedimented, washed, and resuspended in assay buffer containing 0.1 mm phosphopeptide (RRLIEDAEpYAARG) and 60 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were shaken for 3 h at 37 °C and centrifuged briefly. Malachite Green was used to detect free phosphate released from the phosphopeptide by measurement of absorbance at 650 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnologies Inc., Lake Placid, NY). 33P Phosphorylation Assay—Human gingival fibroblasts were cultured in phosphate-free media for 18 h in the presence of 5 μCi/ml of [33P]orthophosphate, washed three times with medium, and then exposed to IL-1β, PDGF, or vehicle control as indicated. SHP-2 was purified by immunoprecipitation as described above. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and the protein transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. The nitrocellulose membranes were analyzed using a STORM phosphorimager. Radioactive 33P incorporation into SHP-2 was quantified by densitometry based on the electrophoretic mobility of SHP-2 determined by Western blotting with anti-SHP-2 antibodies on the same membrane. Electroporation—Cells were harvested by trypsinization, pelleted, and resuspended in serum-free α-MEM buffered with 12.5 mm HEPES. A 30-μl aliquot of cells was placed in a cuvette with 30 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-SHP-2 in HEPES-buffered α-MEM at 4 °C. The cells were electroporated at 100 V/cm and capacitance 960 μF using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with a capacitance expander and Gene Pulser cuvettes (0.2-cm interelectrode distance). Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min and replated in normal growth medium. In selected experiments, to determine the intracellular localization of the anti-SHP-2 antibody, cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips for 4 h after electroporation, fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 antibodies. As a control, cells were subject to electroporation under identical conditions but without the primary anti-SHP-2 antibody. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed by ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons (Dunnett) or by paired or unpaired Student's t test, as indicated. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. SHP-2 Is Associated with Focal Adhesion Complexes—To determine which factors regulate IL-1 signaling to ERK in the context of FAC, we first determined if SHP-2 was localized to FAC in fibroblasts under our experimental conditions. Collagen-coated latex beads were added to cells to induce FAC assembly at sites of cell-bead contact on the dorsal cell surface. Immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-vinculin or anti-SHP-2 antibodies demonstrated that by 30 min after the addition of beads, vinculin and SHP-2 co-localized to the sites of bead-cell contact (Fig. 1), indicating that SHP-2 is associated with nascent focal adhesions. Proteins associated with FAC were purified using magnetic beads and immunoblot analysis of bead-associated proteins revealed a time-dependent recruitment of the focal adhesion protein vinculin and SHP-2 into nascent FAC (Fig. 1D). IRAK, a receptor-associated kinase known to be absent in FAC from unstimulated cells (28MacGillivray M.K. Cruz T.F. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23509-23515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was not present in these preparations and served here as a negative control (Fig. 1C). To ensure that the collagen-coated beads were able to specifically recruit focal adhesion proteins, we repeated the experiment with cells that had been pretreated with 50 nm swinholide A (SWA). This toxin severs actin filaments and prevents actin polymerization, thereby blocking the formation of FAC (46Spector I. Braet F. Shochet N.R. Bubb M.R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, neither vinculin nor SHP-2 was recruited to the beads (Fig. 1D). BSA-coated beads also failed to recruit vinculin or SHP-2 (not shown) indicating receptor specificity. In concert, these data indicate that the proteins isolated in this manner were specifically recruited into bead-bound complexes by mechanisms that are dependent on the formation of integrin-associated FAC and an intact actin cytoskeleton. Catalytic Activity of SHP-2 Is Not Modulated by IL-1—There are several mechanisms by which SHP-2 could modulate IL-1-induced signal transduction leading to ERK activation including alterations of catalytic activity, recruitment to FAC leading to interaction with other signaling molecules, reversible phosphorylation, or by a combination of these events. To investigate possible alterations in its catalytic activity, SHP-2 was purified by immunoprecipitation from control and IL-1-stimulated cells and its catalytic activity analyzed by an in vitro phosphatase assay using a phosphopeptide as a substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This analysis revealed that IL-1 stimulation did not alter the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHP-2 (Table I).Table ITyrosine phosphatase activity in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates (normalized for immunoreactive SHP-2 protein)StimulusPhosphatase activityControl1.52±0.09 pmol of phosphate released/20 minn = 3IL-1 (20 ng/ml for 10 min)1.67±0.08 pmol of phosphate released/20 minn = 3p = N.S.aN.S., not significant versus controla N.S., not significant Open table in a new tab SHP-2 Association with FAC Does Not Require IL-1 Stimulation—SHP-2 might mediate FAC restriction of IL-1-induced ERK activation by differential recruitment to focal adhesions following IL-1 induction. To determine if IL-1 enhances the amount of SHP-2 recruited to nascent FAC, these complexes were isolated from cells using collagen-coated beads as described above. Beads were added to the dorsal surface of cells followed by treatment with IL-1 for 0, 10, 40, and 60 min. SHP-2 was recruited to nascent FAC in a time-dependent manner, but there was no additional increment in the relative abundance of SHP-2 in FAC following IL-1 treatment (Fig. 2). We next examined the effect of IL-1 on SHP-2-FAC association in mature adhesion complexes. For these experiments, cells were plated overnight on fibronectin to facilitate formation of mature FAC, stimulated with IL-1 or vehicle control, and SHP-2 was purified by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-SHP-2 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies against the C terminus of SHP-2 or against the focal adhesion proteins talin and vinculin. IL-1 stimulation had no effect on the levels of the focal adhesion proteins talin or vinculin (used here as a marker of FAC) that co-precipitated with SHP-2 (Fig. 2). We conclude that although a fraction of SHP-2 associates with focal adhesion prote"

Here we show that Sx1A modulates the Lc-type Ca2+ channel, Cav1.2, in a cooperative manner, and we explore whether channel clustering or the Sx1A homodimer is responsible for this activity. Sx1A formed homodimers but, when mutated at the two vicinal transmembrane domain cysteines, was unable to either dimerize or modify the channel activity suggesting disulfide bond formation. Moreover, applying global molecular dynamic search established a theoretical prospect of generating a disulfide bond between two Sx1A transmembrane helices. Nevertheless, Sx1A activity was not correlated with Sx1A homodimer. Application of a vicinal thiol reagent, phenylarsine oxide, abolished Sx1A action indicating the accessibility of Cys-271,272 thiols. Sx1A inhibition of channel activity was restored by phenylarsine oxide antidote, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, consistent with thiol interaction of Sx1A. In addition, the supralinear mode of channel inhibition was correlated to the monomeric form of Sx1A and was apparent only when the three channel subunits α11.2/α2δ1/β2a were present. This functional demonstration of cooperativity suggests that the three-subunit channel responds as a cluster, and Sx1A monomers associate with a dimer (or more) of a three-subunit Ca2+ channel.

Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 7: 5409-5418Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). It is for this reason that the above-mentioned ternary complex is referred to as the SNARE (receptor for soluble NSF attachment proteins) complex.Analysis of ternary complexes formed by the full-length proteins revealed that the C-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs) of both Sx1A and synaptobrevin II were protected from trypsin digestion (4Poirier M.A. Hao J.C.

Moreover, inclusion of these TMDs increased the stability of the ternary complexes and affected the ability of the cytoplasmic domains to join other proteins (4Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N.

Co-reconstituted into liposomes, synaptobrevin II and syntaxin 1A formed a stable binary complex that required the presence of the TMDs (6Margittai M. Otto H. Jahn R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The two SNAREs, Sx1A and synaptobrevin, are both type II bitopic membrane proteins, defined by an N-terminal cytoplasmic region and a single transmembrane domain (7Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 8Bulbarelli A. Sprocati T. Barberi M. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1689-1702PubMed Google Scholar). Highly conserved oligomerization motifs have been identified in the transmembrane domains of Sx1A and synaptobrevin II in studies using the nuclease A/fusion proteins (9Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Laage R. Rohde J. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17481-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These motifs contribute to the interaction between the two proteins in forming homodimers (syntaxin/syntaxin and synaptobrevin II/synaptobrevin II) as well as a heterodimer complex (syntaxin/synaptobrevin II). These interactions serve as further examples in which transmembrane domains participate in the sequence-specific assembly of integral membrane proteins.Sx1A has also been shown to modify the kinetic properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels establishing a pivotal role of Ca2+ channels in the onset and regulation of the release process (11Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D.

The TMD of syntaxin 1A participates in the reduction of current amplitude of N-type (Cav2.2) and Lc-type (Cav1.2) channels (12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Atlas D. Wiser O. Trus M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A Sx1A chimera in which the TMD domain was switched with syntaxin 2 TMD abolished the inhibitory effect of Sx1A, thereby pointing to the inhibitory function of the transmembrane domain (12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Atlas D. Wiser O. Trus M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, botulinum toxin C1, shown to cleave specifically Sx1A close to its transmembrane anchor, abolished Sx1A modulation of inward currents, most likely by uncoupling the Sx1A/channel interaction (12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The Sx1A TMD harbors two vicinal cysteines Cys-271 and Cys-272, one of which, Cys-271, is part of the aforementioned dimerization motifs (10Laage R. Rohde J. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17481-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The two cysteines appear to play an essential role in modulating the voltage-gated channels, Cav1.2 and Cav2.2 (12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Atlas D. Wiser O. Trus M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, syntaxin 2, which has valine residues in the TMD in place of the two cysteines, does not modulate the channel activity (11Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A Sx1A mutant in which the two cysteines were mutated to valine showed loss of function, with no effect on current amplitude, whereas mutating only one of the two cysteines retained the inhibitory activity of syntaxin (12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A gain of function was obtained when the two valines of syntaxin 2 TMD were mutated to Cys, providing the mutant with the ability to inhibit inward Ba2+ currents. Voltage-activated calcium channels are heteromeric complexes composed of the pore-forming α1 subunit together with accessory α2δ and β subunits. Whole-cell Ca2+ channel currents are increased by either α2δ or β2a subunits, up to 100-fold by both. Co-expression of α2δ (either with or without β) triples the channel density on the cell membrane, whereas expression of β2a increases the open state probability (P o) (14Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The α1 subunit contains binding sites for pharmacological agents, proteins, or toxins and determines the electrophysiological properties of different types of Ca2+ channels (15Mitterdorfer J.

The Sx1A modulation of the activity of the channel heterocomplex could perhaps represent an interaction of more than one oligomer, composing a complicated relationship. As such, in order to better understand the mechanism of Sx1A modulation of the activity of the channel we tested the following: 1) the functional implication of putative Sx1A homodimers and monomers to their interaction with the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cav1.2) by reconstituting the Sx1A wt and mutants in the Xenopus oocytes expression system; 2) the contribution of Sx1A transmembranal cysteines to modulating channel activity when Ca2+ ions are the charge carrier; 3) The consequences of thiol groups at the Sx1A TMD to its interaction with the channel; 4) the Sx1A non-linear inhibition of channel activity. Finally, we discuss Sx1A homodimer formation and the contribution of structural plasticity of Sx1A TMD segments to channel clustering; and we propose channel clusters as a model to explain the distinct cooperativity at the late step of membrane fusion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Xenopus Oocytes and cRNA Injection—Stage V and VI oocytes were surgically removed from female Xenopus laevis and treated for 1.5–2 h with 2 mg/ml collagenase (154 units/mg, Worthington) in a Ca2+-free ND solution (mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. After a 12-h recovery period, completely defolliculated oocytes were injected with cRNA mixtures of channel subunits. One day later, cRNA of Sx1A or control (water) was injected (see below and see Refs. 11Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar and 31Wiser O. Trus M.A. Hernandez A. Renstrom E. Barg S. Rorsman P. Atlas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Oocytes were kept at 19 °C for 4–8 days before protein expression was determined.cDNA Constructs—α11.2 (dN60-del1773; X15539) and rat β2a (m80545) were obtained from Dr. N. Qin and Dr. L. Birnbaumer (University of North Carolina); α2/δ1 rabbit skeletal (M86621) from A. Schwartz (University of Ohio). In vitro transcription kit was from Stratagene.cRNA Injection into Oocytes—cRNAs were made using the T7/T3 Stratagene kit, and the product was monitored by gel electrophoresis and optical density measurements. cRNA mixtures were injected into oocytes using a digital microdispenser (Drummond 510, Broomel, PA), in a final volume of 40 nl. Oocytes were kept in 19 °C for 4–8 days until the protein expression was assayed. cRNA amounts were adjusted empirically to make the inward current lower than –4 μA. A relatively high amount of α11.2 cRNA was injected when expressed alone for improved resolution of Sx1A inhibition of current amplitude. cRNA amounts are as follows: 7 ng/oocyte of α11.2 when injected alone; 3 ng/oocyte of α11.2 and 5 ng/oocyte of β2a; 3 ng/oocyte of α11.2 and 2 ng/oocyte of α2δ1; 2 ng/oocyte of α11.2, 1.5 ng/oocyte of α2δ1, and 5 ng/oocyte of β2a.Electrophysiological Assays—Whole-cell currents were recorded by applying a standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp using a Dagan 8500 amplifier. Voltage and current 1% agar cushioned electrodes (0.3–0.6-megohm tip resistance) were filled with 3 m KCl. A reference electrode was placed in a reference chamber filled with 3 m KCl and connected to the assay chamber by two glass bridges filled with 1% agarose dissolved in 3 m KCl. Prior to recording for 15–60 min, oocytes were injected with 40 nl of solution containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 5 mm of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid (potassium salt) final concentration (in oocyte). Current-voltage relationships were determined by applying test pulses with 5- or 10-mV increments from –80 to +60 mV by the data acquisition software Clampex version 7 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Oocytes were assayed for calcium channel activity in Ba2+ solution (mm): 5 Ba (OH)2, 35 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 40 triethanolamine, 1 KOH, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5, titrated to pH 7.5 with methyl sulfonate. Peak currents of each trace plotted against the test potentials gave a current-voltage relationship plot. The negative peak of the bell-shaped, current-voltage relationship plot of each group of oocytes was normalized relative to the group with no Sx1A expression and plotted against the concentration of Sx1A expressed in the oocyte.Pulse duration was adjusted according to tested measurement and channel type. Time scale bars are displayed in each experiment. Current traces were leak-subtracted on-line by Clampex 7 software, and channel activation rates were analyzed by applying a mono-exponential fit of the Clampfit 6 software (Axon Instruments). Fit = A exp(t/τ) + B, where A is current amplitude, τ is time constant, and t is ms. Fit was applied from the beginning of the trace just after the capacitative transient to the peak current region. The capacitative transient lasted for 1–2.5 ms and was subtracted on-line. Hill coefficient (n H) was determined by applying linear regression to the Hill plot.Data Presentation and Statistical Analysis—Peak current and time constant values analyzed by Clampfit 6 and transferred as ASCI file to an Excel worksheet (Microsoft Inc.). Data were averaged for each group of oocytes, and S.E. was determined. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance relative to the control group in each experiment was done by Student's t test by the Excel software. Statistical significance between multiple groups in each experiment was determined using one-way analysis of variance test using the Origin 5 software (Microcal). Final data was transferred to Origin 5 worksheet, plotted, and printed as final figures.Membrane Preparation and Western Blotting—Oocytes were tested for protein expression by Western analysis 5–7 days after cRNA injection. Oocytes were homogenized in buffer containing (in mm) Tris 10, EDTA 1, sucrose 250 and addition of a mixture of proteases as follows: aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, iodoacetamide, pepstatin A, and leupeptin at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged (12,000 × g, 10 min); the pellet (the yolk) was discarded, and the clear (cytosolic fraction) and the white supernatant (membrane fraction) were collected. Protein was determined by a micro-Bradford assay in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader plate using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein samples (30 μg) were mixed with 100 mm DTT and 2% SDS, boiled for 3 min, applied to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed using affinity-purified monoclonal anti-Sx1A (Sigma) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Sx1A expression was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.For visualizing Sx1A dimers, the samples were mixed in native protein loading buffer (no SDS and no DTT) and were not boiled. These samples were loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE and processed as mentioned above.Global Search Molecular Dynamics—A global molecular dynamics search was performed for the Sx1A wild type and each of its mutants Sx(C271V), Sx(C272V), Sx(C271V/C272V), and in addition for syntaxin 2 wild type and its mutant Sx2(C272V/C273V). All calculations were performed using parallel version of crystallography and NMR system, the parallel-processing version of the crystallography and NMR system (CNS version 0.3) (35Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. Gros W. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 5: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16929) Google Scholar), with the optimized potentials for liquid simulations parameter set and united atom topology (36Jorgensen W. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 110: 1657-1666Crossref Scopus (4007) Google Scholar), explicitly describing only polar and aromatic hydrogens. A global search was conducted as described elsewhere, by using CHI (CNS searching of helical interactions), assuming a symmetrical interaction between the two helices (37Adams P. Arkin I. Engelman D. Brunger A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). An α-helical conformation was maintained during the search by applying 3.2-Å maximal distance restraints between Oi and Ni+4. Calculations were performed in a simulated membrane environment with a dielectric constant of 2.0.Trials were conducted starting from both left and right 25° crossing angles, with the helices rotated 360° about their helical axes in 5° increments. Sampling was further increased by performing six trials from each starting configuration, using different initial random velocities, making a total of 864 trials. Clusters of output structures were identified, containing 13 or more structures within 1.0-Å r.m.s.d. from any other structure within the cluster. Consequently, some clusters overlap, and output structures may be members of more than one cluster. The output structures in a cluster were averaged and subjected to a further simulated annealing protocol, as in the initial search. This average was taken as representative of the cluster.Analysis of the Simulations—Comparison of the average structures of clusters from the different mutants was made by calculating the r.m.s.d. of their carbon backbones. However, for Sx1A, no significant similarity was found between the clusters of different mutants, so a different approach was adopted. For each Sx1A mutant and the wild type, more specific clusters were searched for, in which the distance of the cysteine Sγs in positions 271 and/or 272 was in the range of 3–4 Å.RESULTSThe Transmembranal Cys-271 and Cys-272 of Sx1A Play a Crucial Role in the Modulation of Ca v 1.2 Channel Activity— Previously we showed that mutation of two cysteines Cys-271 → Val and Cys-272 → Val abolished the ability of Sx1A to inhibit Ba2+ current amplitude but did not interfere with the modulation of Cav1.2 activation (12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the modification of channel activity by Sx1A is affected by switching the charge carrier (33Wiser O. Cohen R. Atlas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3968-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we explored the functional importance of Sx1A vicinal cysteines in Ca2+ as the permeating ion. Expression of the three subunits, α11.2, α2δ1, and β2a (Cav1.2) in Xenopus oocytes induced well characterized inward Ca2+- or Ba2+-Cav1.2 currents (11Wiser O. Bennett M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 31Wiser O. Trus M.A. Hernandez A. Renstrom E. Barg S. Rorsman P. Atlas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of Cav1.2 were recorded in oocytes expressing the three channel subunits along with Sx1A or Sx1A mutant in which both TMD vicinal Cys residues were mutated to Val; C271V/C272V (Sx(CC/VV)) (Fig. 1). Inward currents were evoked from a holding potential of –80 mV in response to a 160-ms voltage step to +20 mV. Current amplitude was significantly inhibited by Sx1A but was not affected by the Sx(CC/VV) mutant (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the rate of activation was accelerated to a similar extent by Sx1A and Sx(CC/VV), shown by a decrease in the time constant of activation (τact) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the mutation in the vicinal cysteines did not interfere with the ability of Sx1A to increase the rate of inactivation as demonstrated in the range of –15 to –5 mV (Fig. 1D).The lack of activity of the Sx1A double mutant pertaining to current amplitude led us to explore the putative role of the vicinal cysteines in Sx1A and homodimer formation.Transmembranal Cys-271 and Cys-272 of Sx1A Participate in the Homodimerization of Sx1A—Because loss of Sx1A activity was correlated with mutating the two TMD Cys residues, we pursued a biochemical investigation of the potential disulfide bond formation of Sx1A TM domain. For that purpose we have expressed Sx1A and Sx(CC/VV) in Xenopus oocytes and tested the appearance of syntaxin homodimers. Xenopus oocytes were lysed and suspended in native loading buffer without SDS and DTT, or in a standard buffer containing both. Lysate proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE and identified by monoclonal anti-Sx1A antibody using a Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). In the absence of DTT, Sx1A appeared both as a monomer and as a homodimer, whereas in the presence of DTT it appeared only as monomer. No homodimers were observed in oocytes expressing Sx(CC/VV) under the same experimental conditions regardless of the presence or absence of DTT in the sample buffer (Fig. 2A). An Sx1A mutant Sx(C271V), in which only Cys-271 was mutated to Val, migrated as a homodimer on the gel under native conditions (Fig. 2C). Hence, Sx1A homodimer is formed also when a single Cys residue is present at the TM domain. Previously, we showed that this mutant is as active as intact Sx1A (12Trus M. Wiser O. Goodnough M.C. Atlas D. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results show a correlation between homodimer formation and Sx1A activity. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge this represents the first reported native case of formation of disulfide bonds within TM helices.Fig. 2Sx1A mutant does not form homodimers. Sx1A wt (3 ng/oocytes) and Sx(CC/VV) (3 ng/oocyte) were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and 5 days later lysates were prepared and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and visualized in a Western blot using anti Sx1A monoclonal antibody. The protein samples had no SDS and no DTT. A, the 70-kDa homodimer and the 35-kDa monomer of Sx1A wt was shown. Under the same experimental conditions Sx(CC/VV) was visualized only as a monomer. The Sx1A homodimer was reduced when DTT was added to the protein sample. B, Sx1A homodimer was apparent in lysates of oocytes co-expressing the three channel subunits along with Sx1A. C, the syntaxin mutant Sx(C271V) appeared as a homodimer under conditions described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the presence of the channel subunits could alter Sx1A dimerization, we examined oocytes injected with α11.2, α2δ1, β2a, and Sx1A or Sx(CC/VV).

Hence the presence of the channel subunits did not influence Sx1A ho"

Despite the increasing evidence of its efficiency as a melanoma antigen, little is known about the maturation and intracellular trafficking of TRP-2. Here we show that TRP-2 is mainly distributed in the TGN of melanoma cells instead of being confined solely to melanosomes. This, together with the plasma membrane occasional localization observed by immunofluorescence, suggest the TRP-2 participation in a recycling pathway, which could include or not the melanosomes. Using pulse-chase experiments we show that the TRP-2 polypeptide folds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the presence of calnexin, until it reaches a dithiothreitol-resistant conformation enabling its ER exit to the Golgi. If N-glycosylation inhibitors prevent the association with calnexin, the TRP-2 nascent chain undergoes an accelerated degradation process. This process is delayed in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors, indicating that the misfolded chain is retro-translocated from the ER into the cytosol and degraded in proteasomes. This is a rare example in which calnexin although indispensable for the nascent chain folding is not required for its targeting to degradation. Therefore TRP-2 may prove to be a good model to document the calnexin-independent retro-translocation process of proteasomally degraded proteins. Clearly, TRP-2 has a distinct maturation pathway from tyrosinase and TRP-1 and possibly a second regulatory function within the cell."

Several aspects of the biosynthesis of this complex have been defined, including the initial formation of the LU on a polyprenyl phosphate (Pol-P) molecule followed by the sequential addition of galactofuranosyl (Galf) units to generate Pol-P-P-LU-(Galf)1,2,3, etc. and Pol-P-P-LU-galactan, catalyzed by a bifunctional galactosyltransferase (Rv3808c) capable of adding alternating 5- and 6-linked Galf units.

The mycolic acids are attached to the nonreducing ends of the arabinogalactan, whereas the reducing ends are covalently attached to the cross-linked peptidoglycan via phosphoryl-N-acetylglucosaminosyl-rhamnosyl linkage units (P-GlcNAc-Rha).

Approximately 8 g of bacteria (wet weight) were washed with a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 8.0), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm MgCl2 (buffer A), resuspended in 24 ml of buffer A at 4 °C, and subjected to probe sonication as described (4Mikušová K.

The sonicate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet, containing the cell envelope, was resuspended in buffer A to a final volume of 16 ml. Percoll was added to achieve a 60% suspension, and the mixture was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The particulate, upper band was collected, washed twice with buffer A, resuspended in buffer A to a protein concentration of 15–20 mg/ml, and used as the enzyme source in all experiments. Reaction Mixtures for [14C]Gal Labeling and Fractionation of Reaction Products—The basic reaction mixtures for assessing [14C]Gal incorporation into lipid-linked AG precursors were prepared as follows. UDP-[U-14C]Galp (1 μCi; 3.5 nmol; 289 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was dried under a stream of N2, dissolved in 38 μl of buffer A, and incubated with 2 μl of the UDP-Galp mutase preparation (0.13 mg of protein) at 37 °C for 15 min. Other reagents and buffer A were added to yield a final volume of 320 μl containing a 10.8 μm mixture of UDP-[U-14C]Galp and UDP-[U-14C]Galf, 60 μm UDP-GlcNAc, 20 μm dTDP-Rha, 100 μm ATP, and the envelope enzyme fraction (2 mg of protein). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated period of time. In some cases, 60 μm PRPP and/or 200 μm UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide were also included in the reaction mixtures. In the case of the ligation assays, these [14C]Gal labeling reaction mixtures containing both PRPP and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide were incubated at 28 °C for appropriate periods. After incubation, reaction mixtures were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), the resultant pellet was washed thoroughly with 0.9% NaCl and extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), followed by “E-soak” (water/ethanol/diethyl ether/pyridine/ammonium hydroxide; 15:15:5:1:0.017) (15Angus W.W. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as described (16Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) extract was partitioned with water (17Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 479-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The backwashed lower (organic) phase was dried under a stream of N2, and the residue was dissolved in 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (65:25:3.6:0.5) prior to liquid scintillation counting and analysis by TLC. In order to obtain a completely insoluble residue, rich in MAPc, the E-soak insoluble pellet was extracted three times with boiling 60% methanol containing 0.1% ammonium hydroxide. To examine product-precursor relationships between lipid-linked intermediates and the insoluble residue, [14C]Gal-labeled CHCl3/CH3OH/ H2O (10:10:3)-soluble lipid-linked polymers were synthesized using the basic reaction conditions for [14C]Gal labeling described above. These enzymatically synthesized [14C]Gal-labeled compounds (∼300,000 dpm/assay) were dried under N2, and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A by bath sonication. Fresh enzyme (2 mg of protein), cold UDP-Galp preincubated with UDP-Galp mutase, UDP-GlcNAc, dTDP-Rha, ATP, PRPP, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, and buffer A were added to achieve the same concentrations and volume used in the ligation assays. The resulting mixture was bath sonicated and incubated for periods of time up to 16 h. Reaction mixtures were extracted as described above. Labeling of the Arabinan Component of AG with P[14C]RPP—The basic reaction mixture contained 3.3 μm P[14C]RPP (∼600,000 dpm), 60 μm UDP-GlcNAc, 20 μm dTDP-Rha, 60 μm UDP-Galp preincubated with UDP-Galp mutase (as described above), 100 μm ATP, enzyme (2 mg of protein), and buffer A in a total volume of 320 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and fractionation of the reaction products was conducted as described above for [14C]Gal labeling. Analysis of the Insoluble Residue—The insoluble residue, enriched in MAPc, was subjected to base treatment with 2 ml of 0.5% KOH in methanol for 4 days at 37 °C with gentle stirring. After washing three times with methanol, the methyl esters of the mycolic acids were removed with two diethyl ether extractions. The residual pellet was dried under N2 and digested with 100 μg/ml of Proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) in 250 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.5) at 37 °C overnight. Radioactivity released into the supernatant from the insoluble pellet by Proteinase K treatment was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting and subjected to sugar analysis as described below. After washing with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, the residual pellet was treated with 2.5 units of purified Chalaropsis muramidase in 250 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 500 units/ml of lysozyme in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), or Proteinase K at 37 °C overnight. Aliquots of radiolabeled materials solubilized by these treatments were subjected to liquid scintillation counting and sugar analysis. Analysis—In order to facilitate size exclusion chromatography of the polyprenyl-P-linked polymers, the CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)-soluble, E-soak-soluble, and Chalaropsis muramidase-solubilized materials were hydrolyzed in mild acid as follows to selectively cleave the prenyl phosphate. Samples were suspended in 50 μl of 1-propanol by bath sonication, followed by 100 μl of 0.02 n HCl, and the resulting mixture was incubated for 30 min at 60 °C (18Lucas J.J. Waechter C.J.

After neutralization with 10 μl of 0.2 n NaOH, the released water-soluble products were applied to a Biogel P-100 column (1 × 118 cm), equilibrated, and eluted with 100 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.0). SDS-PAGE analysis of enzymatically radiolabeled products was done using Novex® 10–20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. After electrophoresis, samples were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, which were dried at room temperature, and subjected to autoradiography. CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)-soluble materials were analyzed on silica gel TLC plates developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/1 m ammonium acetate/H2O (180:140:9:9:23), which were then subjected to autoradiography. For [14C]sugar analysis, samples were subjected to acid hydrolysis in 2 m CF3COOH for1hat120 °C. Hydrolysates were analyzed on silica gel TLC plates (silica gel G60, aluminum-backed; EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ), developed in pyridine/ethyl acetate/glacial acetic acid/water (5:5:1:3), and autoradiography. Radioactive spots were identified by comparative chromatography with standard sugars. Protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce).

In the present study, we modified this cell-free system in order to demonstrate the sequential synthesis of the simpler glycolipid intermediates, followed by polyprenyl-P-P-linked galactan and arabinan intermediates, and in vitro ligation of these lipid-linked arabinogalactan intermediates to PG. The cell wall-membrane fraction of M. smegmatis, the source of endogenous glycosyltransferases and polyprenyl-P, was supplemented with UDP-GlcNAc, dTDP-Rha, the precursors of LU, and UDP-[14C]Galp and UDP-Galp mutase as the source of the Galf units of galactan. Reaction products were extracted with the organic solvents, CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), and “E-soak” (15Angus W.W. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem.

The incorporation of [14C]Galf from UDP-[14C]Galp into these four fractions is shown in Table I. Analysis of the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)-, CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)-, and E-soak-soluble materials for 14C-labeled sugars showed that [14C]Gal was the sole radioactive sugar component (data not shown).

No further simple glycolipid intermediates were observed in the more polar CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) extract; the bulk of its radioactivity remained at the origin of the TLC plate (results not shown), supporting the evidence that this fraction contained the polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-AG intermediates (5Mikušová K.

The addition of exogenous PRPP and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, precursors of arabinan and peptidoglycan synthesis, respectively, stimulated incorporation of [14C]Gal into the MAPc-containing residue in an additive manner with a concomitant reduction of radioactivity in the CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) and E-soak extracts (Table I), suggesting that the polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-(Gal)1–4 and the polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-AG intermediates in these extracts were precursors of the mature PG-bound AG. However, the increase in insoluble material is not fully matched by a concomitant decrease in the other fractions. There is a substantial loss of radioactivity from the CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) and E-soak extracts in incubations containing the additional precursors UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and PRPP. This is presumably due to a shortage of endogenous lipid carrier, required for de novo PG and decaprenyl-P-Araf synthesis when the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and PRPP precursors are added.Table IInfluence of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and PRPP on the incorporation of [14C]Gal into organic solvent-soluble and insoluble fractionsReaction mixtureCHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)E-soakInsoluble residuedpm/fractiondpm/fractionBasic16,000400,000270,0002,200With UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide14,000280,000110,0003,000 (36%)aValues shown in parentheses are percentage increases in radioactivity incorporated into the insoluble residue relative to that seen in the basic reaction.

Parallel reactions containing UDP-[14C]Galp were run, and similar extracts were prepared. Complete acid hydrolysis and TLC analysis for radioactive sugar showed that all of the [14C]Gal remained as such, and the majority of the P[14C]RPP radiolabel was converted into [14C]Ara-containing material; a minority appeared as [14C]ribose, apparently from intermediates of an unidentified riban (8Scherman M.S.

TLC of the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)-soluble products showed a preponderance of polyprenyl (C50)-P-Araf in this fraction (7Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Mild acid hydrolysis of the [14C]Ara-labeled CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)-soluble and E-soak-soluble lipid polymers to remove the presumed polyprenyl-P and subsequent gel filtration showed considerable overlap but not complete coincidence in the profiles of these two sets of [14C]Ara-containing polymers (Fig. 2). Profiles were similar to those of the [14C]Gal-labeled polymers, labeled, released, and extracted under similar conditions (Fig. 2). In both cases, the E-soak-extractable material appeared to be slightly but reproducibly larger than that extractable with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), pointing to the presence of a population of polyprenyl-P-linked AG intermediates, partially resolvable by the two extractants. These lipid-linked intermediates were also analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Overnight exposure of autoradiograms revealed a population of [14C]Gal-labeled CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)- and E-soak-soluble lipid-linked polymers, whereas no images were seen in lanes containing [14C]Ara-labeled lipid-linked polymers, presumably due to lower labeling efficiency when using P[14C]RPP as the precursor. However, after 14 days of exposure, the [14C]Ara-containing CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)- and E-soak-soluble lipid-linked polymers were also visible on the autoradiograms and showed a degree of heterogeneity similar to that of the [14C]Gal-labeled material. The E-soak soluble [14C]Ara- and [14C]Galf-containing lipid polymers again appeared to be larger than the CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)-soluble material, supporting the trend seen in the size exclusion analysis. Analysis for radioactive sugar content in these extracts confirmed the sole presence of [14C]Ara and [14C]Gal in the respectively labeled polymers.Fig. 3Tricine SDS-PAGE analysis of radiolabeled, lipid-linked polymers.

The major pathway for ceramide accumulation is via agonist-induced activation of cellular sphingomyelinases. It has also been shown that the ceramide level in circulating low density lipoprotein (LDL) increases during systemic inflammation, hence it is of importance to understand whether LDL-derived ceramide also contributes to the cellular ceramide homeostasis and affects cell functions. This article provides evidence of uptake of ceramide-enriched LDL by human microvascular endothelial cells in a receptor-mediated fashion. This uptake can be competed by native LDL, indicating that the LDL-binding receptor may be involved. Following uptake, part of the LDL-derived ceramide is converted to sphingosine, but more importantly, part of it accumulates inside the cells (approximately 1.44 nmol/mg of cell protein). This accumulation of ceramide correlates with an increased incidence of apoptosis. The addition of tumor necrosis factor-α further enhances the accumulation of LDL-derived ceramide and the rate of apoptosis. In contrast, inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis block both, the accumulation of LDL-derived ceramide and the concurrent increase in apoptosis. We also show that LDL-delivered ceramide is a more efficient inducer of apoptosis as compared with ethanol-delivered ceramide, the same apoptotic effect being achieved by substantially smaller increases in intracellular ceramide. Taken together, the presented data indicate that increases in lipoprotein ceramide concentration may result in changes in the bioactive properties of circulating lipoproteins such as the enhanced ability to induce apoptosis in the microvascular endothelium.

Recent studies suggest that changes in the sphingolipid content of LDL also affect the development of atherosclerosis by promoting aggregation (8Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Xu S.W. Swenson T.L.

These studies have focused on the role of secreted, zinc-dependent, sphingomyelinase (S-SMase), which hydrolyzes LDL sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide. It is secreted mainly by endothelial cells in vitro in response to either TNF-α or interleukin-1β (12Marathe S. Schissel S. Yellin M.J. Beatini N. Mintzer R. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol.

Studies using bacterial SMase or recombinant S-SMase have shown that conversion of LDL-SM to ceramide leads to aggregation (8Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Xu S.W. Swenson T.L. Williams K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36409-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The possible role of SMase has been further emphasized by data showing that LDL extracted from advanced human aortic plaques has higher ceramide content than LDL extracted from circulation or from normal aorta (19Haimovitz-Friedman A. Cordon-Cardo C. Bayoumy S. Garzotto M. McLoughlin M. Gallily R. Edwards 3rd, C.K. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that changes in the SM/ceramide ratio of LDL affect their atherogenic properties, however, they do not distinguish between the effect of ceramide increase and that of SM depletion. Studies in animal models as well as in isolated rat hepatocytes have shown that activation of serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting step in de novo ceramide synthesis in the liver increases up to 8 times the ceramide content of very low density lipoprotein and LDL that account for 80% of the total serum ceramide (15Memon R.A. Holleran W.M. Moser A.H. Uchida Y. Fuller J. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

This is attributed to specific increases in the secretion of ceramide by the liver, which is not, however, paralleled by a decrease in SM mass. Hence, these studies seem to indicate that the ceramide level is not regulated solely by activation of S-SMase, and therefore, ceramide effects on LDL properties have to be assessed independently of those of S-SMase. Ceramide is a bioactive molecule that participates in signal transduction cascades initiated by cytokines, oxidized LDL, and chemotherapeutic drugs. In endothelial cells, regulation of the ceramide level is critical for cell functions and survival (17Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J.

Cordon-Cardo C. Bayoumy S. Garzotto M. McLoughlin M. Gallily R. Edwards 3rd, C.K. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), the activation of acidic sphingomyelinase by lipopolysaccharide has been shown to be a requirement for the onset of endothelial apoptosis and endotoxic shock-mediated death. Also, removal of excess ceramide in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by activating ceramidase prevents TNF-α-induced cell death and the resulting accumulation of sphingosine and sphingosine phosphate induces the expression of the adhesion molecules E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (17Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P. Khew-Goodall Y. Bert A.G. Barter P.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14196-14201Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The pathways for intracellular generation and turnover of ceramide have been the subject of extensive studies. However, the possibility for lipoprotein-derived ceramide being a significant source of ceramide has not been explored. Such a pathway could be important for vascular cells involved in active lipoprotein uptake and turnover, especially during inflammation (20Lightle, S., Tosheva, R., Lee, A., Queen-Baker, J., Boyanovsky, B., Shedlofsky, S., and Nikolova-Karakashian, M. (2003) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., in pressGoogle Scholar) or aging, 2S. Lightle and M. Nikolova-Karakashian, unpublished observations. when the lipoprotein levels of ceramide are increased. In this article we describe a method for selective enrichment of native LDL with short chain ceramide. Analyses of the biophysical and biochemical properties of these ceramide-enriched particles show that ceramide alone is not sufficient to induce LDL aggregation or oxidation. Human microvascular endothelial-1 (HME-1) cells take up ceramide-enriched LDL in a receptor-mediated fashion, leading to accumulation of LDL-derived ceramide inside the cells. This induces apoptosis in HME-1 cells, which can be blocked by inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Materials—N-Hexanoyl-((N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-sphingosine (C6-NBD-Cer) was purchased from Matreya (State College, PA), N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide, C2-Cer) and sphingosine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). SMase from Staphylococcus aureus and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma. BSA was maleylated according to the method of Butler and Hartley (21Butler P. Hartley B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The in situ cell death detection kit was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis kit was from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). PRO61049, an antibody against the LDL binding sites in the LDL receptor was purchased from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). Human recombinant TNF-α (Escherichia coli-derived, lot number AA181091) was purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). N-Acetyl-C20-sphinganine was synthesized as described previously (22Nimkar S. Menaldino D. Merrill A.H. Liotta D.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 3037-3040Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and used as an internal standard. Cell Cultures—HME-1 cells (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) were used in the experiments. Cells were cultured in MCDB-131 media (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml epidermal growth factor (Calbiochem). In all experiments, cells were cultured in serum-reduced medium containing 0.2% serum and 1 μg/ml epidermal growth factor for 12–16 h before treatment. The treatments also were conducted in serum-reduced medium. Human Lipoproteins—LDL (density between 1.019 and 1.063 g/ml) was isolated from the venous blood of healthy human subjects. Plasma obtained by low speed centrifugation of the whole blood was purchased from the Central Kentucky Blood Center (Lexington, KY). Plasma was stored at 4 °C and used within 48 h for isolation of LDL. Lipoprotein fractions were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation according to the method of Havel et al. (23Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Briefly, the density of the plasma was adjusted to 1.019 g/ml with KBr solution (d = 1.34 g/ml). The plasma was centrifuged at 208,000 × g for 18 h at 10 °C using Quick Seal™ ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman-Spinco, Palo Alto, CA) and a Beckman Ti70 rotor. The top fraction was discarded and the density of the bottom fraction was adjusted to 1.063 g/ml. Ultracentrifugation was repeated and the top fraction was collected as LDL. After isolation, LDL was tested for albumin contamination by gel electrophoresis. LDL ran as a single protein band indicating the absence of albumin contamination. The LDL was stored under argon to prevent oxidation. Enrichment of LDL with C 6 -NBD-Cer or C 2 -Cer—To selectively enrich LDL with ceramide without affecting the levels of SM, ceramide-containing liposomes were used as donor and native LDL was used as acceptor. Initially, C6-NBD-Cer was used for optimizing the enrichment procedure. Donor liposomes were prepared as follows. Total lipids were extracted from native LDL (0.5 mg of protein) according to the two-phase extraction procedure of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), modified as described previously (25Williams R. Wang E. Merill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After extraction, the lipids from the lower chloroform phase were passed through a sodium sulfate column, and mixed with 2, 5, or 10 nmol of C6-NBD-Cer (for a final concentration of ceramide during the transfer of 10, 25, or 50 μm). The solvent was evaporated under a stream of argon, and the lipids were resuspended in 100 μl of KBr (d = 1.019), vortexed, and sonicated in a water bath sonicator until translucent. Then 0.5 mg of native LDL (acceptor) was added and incubated with the donor vesicles for 30 min at 37 °C under argon in a final volume of 0.2 ml of KBr (d = 1.019). For cell culture experiments, C2- and C6-ceramide were used instead of C6-NBD-ceramide at a concentration of 50 μm. In each individual preparation, the amount of all reagents was changed accordingly to obtain the desired amount of Cer-enriched LDL. In all cases, the final volume was less than 1 ml. After the incubation, the suspension was overlaid with KBr (d = 1.019) to a final volume of 1 ml and centrifuged for 2.5 h at 265,000 × g at 10 °C using a Beckman-Spinco tabletop ultracentrifuge. The donor particles were recovered floating at the surface and removed. The volume was adjusted again to 1 ml with KBr (d = 1.019) and the samples were spun again. The ceramide-enriched LDL (Cer-LDL) was recovered in the lower 0.5 ml of the suspension. The amount of incorporated C6-NBD-Cer was analyzed on HPLC equipped with fluorescence detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and calculated based on the quantum yield of the external standard with a known concentration (26Nikolova-Karakashian M.N. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-181724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mass of incorporated C2- or C6-Cer was analyzed by TLC/HPLC as described below. The degree of enrichment was represented as nanomole of Cer per mg of LDL protein. Throughout the experiments, LDL which underwent the same procedure, but donor particles did not contain ceramide, was used as controls (control LDL). Cer-LDL was prepared fresh for each experiment and used within 24 h. Quality Control of Cer-LDL Particles—The oxidation of LDL was monitored by malonaldehyde bis-demethylacetal colorimetric assay and relative electrophoretic mobility in a 1.8% agarose gel. The aggregation was monitored by gel electrophoresis. As a positive control for aggregation, LDL (50 μg) was treated with bacterial SMase at various concentrations for 24 h in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4. As a positive control for oxidation, LDL was treated with 50 μm CuSO4 for 24 h. Typically, 10 μg of LDL were loaded per lane. The C6-NBD-Cer in LDL was visualized by UV light. The protein was visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Binding and Degradation Assay—For these experiments, 125I-labeled LDL was prepared according to Bilheimer's modification (27Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) of the iodine monochloride method described by Goldstein et al. (28Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Enrichment with C2-Cer was performed after the labeling procedure. HME-1 cells were cultured in 12-well plates until confluence and changed to serum-reduced medium for 12 h. For binding studies, cells were cooled down to 4 °C, and after washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, adherent cells were treated with medium containing the indicated concentrations of ligand. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the conditioned media was removed, and the cells were washed rapidly 3 times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mg/ml fatty acid free BSA) followed by 2 washes with washing buffer without BSA. The cells were dissolved in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH for 2 h on a rotary platform at room temperature. The radioactivity was measured on a γ-counter (Cobra II, Packard Instrument Co.). The uptake was assessed by monitoring the proteolytic degradation of 125I-labeled LDL or Cer-LDL (29Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). After serum starvation, cells were treated with the indicated ligands for 6 h at 37 °C; the medium was collected and cleared from possible detached cells by centrifugation. The radioactivity was measured in a trichloroacetic acid-soluble, chloroform-unextractable fraction of the media and used as a measure for lipoprotein uptake after subtraction of the background. The background was quantified using control incubations with empty wells. Lipid Assays—HME-1 cells were treated with C2-Cer-LDL as indicated. Then cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with three passes through a 25-gauge needle. Aliquots were taken for protein determination, and the lipids were extracted from the remaining homogenate as described (24Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar, 25Williams R. Wang E. Merill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Lipids from each dish were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) with ether:methanol (99:1, by volume) as a developing solvent. In this mobile phase, the relative mobility of C2-Cer was 0.14, and for long chain ceramide 0.82. The lipids were visualized with I2. The spots migrating with standard C2-Cer or long chain ceramide were scraped and the lipids were eluted from the silica using 2 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1 by volume) by vigorous vortexing for 1 min, and centrifugation for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge. This procedure was repeated 3 times, and pooled supernatants were evaporated under reduced pressure. To quantify the mass of ceramide, 0.5 nmol of N-acetyl-C20-sphinganine was added to each sample as an internal standard. Samples were analyzed on HPLC after acid methanolysis and values were corrected for recovery of the internal standard (30Chen J. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Merrill Jr., A.H. Morgan E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25233-25238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Free sphingolipid bases were quantified in separate experiments as described (31Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For quantification of ceramide in LDL, lipids were extracted from 20 μg of LDL following the same procedure. Assay of Apoptosis by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated Nick-end Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—Apoptosis in HME-1 cells was detected using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics) (32Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 119: 493-501Crossref Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in 6-well dishes on glass coverslips in the medium described above. Before experiments, cells were serum-deprived and then treated with appropriate reagents and controls for 16 h. Labeling of 3′ free hydroxyl ends of the fragmented DNA with fluorescein-conjugated dUTP was catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, using a commercially available kit, following the manufacturer's directions. The apoptotic cells were then detected by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Diaphot 300, Kyoto, Japan). Averages of 600 cells from random fields on each slide were analyzed. Sample indicators were concealed during scoring, and samples from three independent experiments were scored per group. Assay of Apoptosis by Annexin V Staining—Apoptosis was also assayed by the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis kit. Briefly, HME-1 cells were cultured in 6-well dishes and treated as described above. After 6 h, cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, detached with 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen), and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were discarded, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1 μg/sample) and propidium iodide (1 μg/sample) for 30 min in the dark (33Fadok V.A.

Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy (Nikon Diaphot 300, Japan) or by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences) within 1 h. Enrichment of LDL with Ceramide—Various concentrations of native LDL (acceptor) and C6-NBD-Cer-containing liposomes (donors) were incubated for different periods of time at 37 °C. Following incubation, the donor liposomes were removed by floating through a density gradient. The loss of LDL protein during the procedure was less than 10% (data not shown). The resulting ceramide-enriched LDL was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with UV light or Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1, panel A). The protein and C6-NBD-Cer bands overlapped, confirming that C6-NBD-Cer had incorporated into the LDL particles. The rate of incorporation correlated linearly with the increasing C6-NBD-Cer concentration in the donor vesicles (Fig. 1, panel B). The transfer reached equilibrium in ∼30 min of incubation (Fig. 1, panel C). Similar results were obtained when C2-Cer was used instead of C6-NBD-Cer. Enrichment of LDL with Ceramide Does Not Cause Extensive Aggregation and Oxidation—Treatment of LDL with bacterial SMase induces aggregation (8Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Xu S.W. Swenson T.L. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and facilitates oxidation (11Subbaiah P.V. Subramanian V.S. Wang K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36409-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) of the particles. The Cer-LDL was analyzed for aggregation and oxidation to test whether increases in ceramide levels alone are sufficient to alter these properties of LDL. SMase-treated LDL was used as a positive control. As expected, a significant portion of the SMase-treated LDL aggregated as indicated by the smeared pattern seen on an agarose gel or by their inability to enter the gel all together (Fig. 2, panel B). Some SMase-treated particles also have a shift in the electrophoretic mobility. Such shift was typical for oxidized LDL that was incubated with CuSO4 (Fig. 2, panel C). In contrast, Cer-LDL was neither aggregated nor oxidized (Fig. 2, panel A). The lack of oxidation was confirmed further by measuring the levels of thiobarbituric reactive substances in Cer-LDL. Cer-LDL and native LDL had similar levels of thiobarbituric reactive substances (<0.1 nmol/mg), which were significantly lower than that in mildly oxidized LDL (7.25 nmol/mg). To control for the level of ceramide in both treatments, the generation of ceramide in SMase-treated particles was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, SMase treatment resulted in the generation of 10 to 12 nmol/mg of ceramide, which is similar to the levels of ceramide in Cer-LDL (between 12 and 18 nmol/mg). This shows that the lack of aggregation or oxidation in Cer-LDL is not because of the lower ceramide level. Taken together, these results show that enrichment with ceramide alone does not induce oxidation or aggregation of LDL. Binding and Uptake of Cer-LDL by HME-1 Cells Is Receptor-mediated—The uptake of Cer-LDL was studied in human microvascular endothelial cells that express different LDL-binding receptors, including the LDL receptor, scavenger receptor BI, and CD 36 (35Blair A. Shaul P.W. Yuhanna I.S. Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32512-32519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 36Swerlick R.A. Lee K.H. Wick T.M. Lawley T.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 78-83PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics for Cer-LDL and LDL uptake and binding were very similar. Both the binding and the uptake reached saturation at a ligand concentration of 75–100 μg/ml and were competed by non-labeled LDL at 50-fold excess (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data show that the uptake of Cer-LDL like that of native LDL is receptor-mediated and most likely involves the same receptor(s). LDL-derived C 2 -Cer Accumulates in HME-1 Cells—The uptake of native LDL does not affect the levels of endogenous sphingolipids, suggesting that the ceramide present in the native LDL is hydrolyzed by the lysosomal ceramidase to sphingosine that in turn is further metabolized to sphingosine-phosphate or re-acylated back to ceramide. Indeed, when HME-1 cells were treated with native LDL, no increases were detected in the intracellular levels of ceramide and sphingosine. On the contrary, cells treated with C2-Cer-LDL began to accumulate C2-Cer within 60 min reaching 1.44 nmol of Cer/mg of cell protein in 4 h, whereas sphingosine concentrations increased by 1.40 nmol (Table I). This implies that although LDL-derived C2-Cer is hydrolyzed to sphingosine, the rate of hydrolysis is not sufficient for complete elimination of the excess ceramide. It is unlikely that such accumulation is caused by lower affinity of ceramidase for short chain ceramide because (i) earlier studies in cell cultures have shown efficient hydrolysis of C2-Cer and C6-ceramide to sphingosine (26Nikolova-Karakashian M.N.

https://openalex.org/W2036444072,"The autolysis loop (residues 143–154 in chymotrypsinogen numbering) plays a pivotal role in determining the macromolecular substrate and inhibitor specificity of coagulation proteases. This loop in factor IXa (FIXa) has 3 basic residues (Arg143, Lys147, and Arg150) whose contribution to the protease specificity of factor IXa has not been studied. Here, we substituted these residues individually with Ala in Gla-domainless forms of recombinant factor IX expressed in mammalian cells. All mutants exhibited normal amidolytic activities toward a FIXa-specific chromogenic substrate. However, Arg143 and Lys147 mutants showed a ∼3- to 6-fold impairment in FX activation, whereas the Arg150 mutant activated factor X normally both in the absence and presence of factor VIIIa. By contrast, Arg143 and Lys147 mutants reacted normally with antithrombin (AT) in both the absence and presence of the cofactor, heparin. However, the reactivity of the Arg150 mutant with AT was impaired 6.6-fold in the absence of heparin and 33- to 70-fold in the presence of pentasaccharide and full-length heparins. These results suggest that Arg143 and Lys147 of the autolysis loop are recognition sites for FX independent of factor VIIIa, and Arg150 is a specific recognition site for AT that can effectively interact with AT only if the serpin is in the heparin-activated conformation.

FIXa plays a key role in hemostasis, and its deficiency is associated with the life-threatening disease, hemophilia B (6Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Google Scholar). FIX circulates in plasma as a single-chain inactive zymogen with 415 amino acids (6Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage at two sites (Arg145-Ala, and Arg180-Val) by either one of two physiological activators, the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex or factor XIa, releases an activation peptide that converts the zymogen to an active enzyme consisting of a light and a heavy chain held together by a single disulfide bond (7Osterud B. Rapaport S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5260-5264Google Scholar, 8Lindquist P.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Google Scholar, 9Hamaguchi N. Charifson P.S. Pedersen L.G. Brayer G.D. Smith K.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15213-15220Google Scholar). The N-terminal light chain of FIXa contains the non-catalytic Gla and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, whereas the C-terminal heavy chain contains the trypsin-like catalytic domain of the molecule (10Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Google Scholar). The Gla and the N-terminal EGF domains are involved in the Ca2+-dependent assembly of the protease with FVIIIa on membrane surfaces (10Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Google Scholar, 11Mertens K. Celie P.H.N. Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 209-217Google Scholar). It is believed that the protease domain of FIXa also interacts with FVIIIa (12Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Google Scholar). The role of the C-terminal EGF domain of FIXa is not known. Crystallographic and mutagenesis data suggest that it makes extensive interactions with the catalytic domain and thus may be critical for the structural integrity and proper orientation of the catalytic domain for interaction with either substrate and/or cofactor on membrane surfaces (13Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Google Scholar, 14Wilkinson F.H. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5734-5741Google Scholar). In the absence of a cofactor, FIXa exhibits very low catalytic activity toward both small synthetic and natural macromolecular substrates and inhibitors. Although FVIIIa enhances the proteolytic activity of FIXa toward its natural substrate FX by four or five orders of magnitude, the cofactor has no effect on the catalytic activity of FIXa toward small synthetic substrates (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Google Scholar, 11Mertens K. Celie P.H.N. Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 209-217Google Scholar, 15Hopfner K.-P. Brandstetter H. Karcher A. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6626-6635Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which FVIIIa improves the catalytic competency of FIXa toward FX is not known. Recent structural and mutagenesis data have indicated that the “99-loop” (per nomenclature of Ref. 25Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Google Scholar) of FIXa traps the protease in an inactive conformation by blocking the entrance of FX into the catalytic pocket. Thus, one mechanism by which FVIIIa may activate FIXa involves conformational rearrangement of the 99-loop (16Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Bode W. Hopfner K.-P. Brandstetter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4121-4126Google Scholar). Similar to its reaction with FX, the reactivity of FIXa with the target serpin inhibitor antithrombin (AT) is very poor in plasma (17Fuchs H.E. Trapp H.G. Griffith M.J. Roberts H.R. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1696-1703Google Scholar, 18Pieters J. Lindhout T. Willems G. Blood. 1990; 76: 549-554Google Scholar). In this case, heparin functions as a cofactor to accelerate the rate of FIXa inhibition by the serpin by several orders of magnitude (18Pieters J. Lindhout T. Willems G. Blood. 1990; 76: 549-554Google Scholar, 19Jordan R.E. Oosta G.M. Gardner W.T. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10081-10090Google Scholar). Heparin has more recently been shown to accelerate the inhibition of FIXa and FXa by AT by similar mechanisms (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar, 21Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar, 22Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). For both enzymes, the rate-accelerating effect of heparin is believed to arise from 1) the ability of heparin to change the conformation of the serpin to facilitate its optimal recognition by the enzyme (allosteric activation mechanism) and 2) the ability of a full-length heparin to bridge the inhibitor and enzyme in a ternary complex, thereby promoting the initial interaction between the two proteins (template mechanism). With respect to the latter template mechanism, recent mutagenesis data have indicated that both FIXa (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar) and FXa (21Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar) have a cluster of basic residues in their catalytic domains that can interact with heparin when physiological levels of Ca2+ are present. Thus, the simultaneous binding of a full-length heparin to the basic site of either protease in the presence of Ca2+ and to a basic site of AT improves the KD for the interaction of the two proteins, leading to a 100- to 1000-fold acceleration of the reaction (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar, 21Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar, 22Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). In the case of the allosteric activation mechanism, the binding of a distinct pentasaccharide sequence of the full-length heparin to AT allosterically changes the conformation of the serpin, leading to an additional 200- to 500-fold improvement in reactivity of the serpin with both FIXa and FXa (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar, 22Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). Allosteric activation of AT by heparin has minimal effect on its reactivity with thrombin (23Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Google Scholar). It is not known how allosteric activation of AT by heparin specifically improves the reactivity of the serpin with the coagulation proteases, FIXa and FXa. Structural data suggest that the catalytic domain of FIXa, similar to other coagulation proteases, has several solvent-exposed surface loops that surround the substrate-binding pocket of the enzyme (13Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Google Scholar, 24Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Google Scholar). Although these surface loops are generally conserved at similar three-dimensional locations on all coagulation proteases, the length and amino acid residues forming the loops are not conserved in the members of the family. One of these surface loops consisting of residues 143–154 (chymotrypsinogen numbering (25Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Google Scholar)), referred to as the autolysis loop, has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in determining the substrate and inhibitor specificity of coagulation proteases (26Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19341-19348Google Scholar, 27Gale A.J. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 585-593Google Scholar, 28Shen L. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1078-1087Google Scholar, 29Kolkman J.A. Mertens K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 701-707Google Scholar). In the case of FXa, we recently demonstrated that the basic residues of the autolysis loop minimally contribute to recognition of the substrate prothrombin in either the absence or presence of factor Va on negatively charged phospholipid vesicles (30Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). In its reaction with AT, however, we discovered that basic residues of this loop play distinct roles in FXa recognition of AT. Thus, neutralization of charges of both Arg143 and Lys147 by their substitution with Ala improved the reactivity of the mutant proteases with AT in the absence of heparin, whereas the substitution of Arg150 with Ala led to an order of magnitude impairment in the reactivity of the mutant with AT specifically in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide (30Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). These results suggested that Arg150 of factor Xa makes a specific interaction with AT when the serpin is in an activated conformation, presumably involving a recently proposed serpin exosite (31Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14961-14971Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar to FXa and unlike thrombin, the autolysis loop of FIXa contains three basic residues that are conserved at the same three-dimensional locations (13Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Google Scholar, 32Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Google Scholar). To understand the contribution of these basic residues to determining the substrate and inhibitor specificity of FIXa, we prepared three Gla-domainless mutants of FIX (GD-FIX) in which these residues were substituted with Ala. The mutants, GD-FIX R143A, K147A, and R150A together with the wild-type GD-FIX, were expressed in mammalian cells and purified to homogeneity (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). Following activation by Russell's viper venom protease, the catalytic properties of the mutants were characterized with respect to their ability to hydrolyze a FIXa-specific chromogenic substrate, activate the natural substrate FX in both the absence and presence of FVIIIa, and react with AT in either the absence or presence of pentasaccharide and full-length heparins. The results indicate that the basic residues Arg143 and Lys147 are critical for interaction of FIXa with FX independent of FVIIIa. Moreover, Arg150 is a recognition site on FIXa for AT that can effectively interact with AT only if the serpin is in the heparin-activated conformation. Mutagenesis and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—The wild-type and FIX mutants, Arg143 → Ala (R143A), Lys147 → Ala (K147A), and Arg150→ Ala (R150A) (chymotrypsinogen numbering (25Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Google Scholar)) corresponding to residues Arg312, Lys316, and Arg318 in the FIX cDNA numbering (6Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Google Scholar), were generated in the RSV-PL4 expression/purification vector system in Gla-domainless forms (GD-FIX) by standard PCR mutagenesis methods as described before (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). After confirmation of the accuracy of the mutagenesis by DNA sequencing, the constructs were introduced into HEK293 cells, and the mutant proteins were isolated from 20 liters of cell culture supernatants by an immunoaffinity chromatography using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody as described previously (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). Human plasma FIXa, FX, FXa, and FX activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom (RVV-X) were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Human recombinant AT was prepared as described previously (33Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described previously (34Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Google Scholar). Human recombinant FVIIIa was a generous gift from Dr. Philip Fay (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY). Unfractionated heparin (heparin sodium injection, USP, 10,000 units/ml) from beef lung and the active AT-binding pentasaccharide fragment of heparin (fondaparinux sodium) were purchased from Quintiles Clinical Supplies (Mt. Laurel, NJ). The concentration of pentasaccharide, used in molar excess over AT in all reactions, was calculated based on its weight assuming a molecular mass of 1728 Da (C31H43N3Na10O49S8). The concentration of the unfractionated heparin was based on antithrombin binding sites and was determined by stoichiometric titrations of antithrombin with the polysaccharide, with monitoring of the interaction by changes in protein fluorescence as described previously (35Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Google Scholar). Heparin-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ), the chromogenic substrates, Spectrozyme FXa (SpFXa) and CH3SO2-d-Leu-Gly-Arg-pNA (LGR-pNA) were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT) and Midwest Bio-Tech Inc. (Fishers, IN), respectively. Polybrene and p-aminobenzamidine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Activation of FIX Mutants—FIX derivatives (∼0.5 mg) in 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl (TBS buffer) containing 5 mm Ca2+ were converted to their active forms with 50 μg of RVV-X for 3 h at 37 °C as described previously (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). FIXa derivatives were separated from the snake venom by applying the activation mixtures on a 2-ml heparin-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer as described previously (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). The column was extensively washed with the same buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl followed by elution with 0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions were identified by an amidolytic activity assay, pooled, and active site-titrated with known concentrations of AT in the presence of pentasaccharide as described (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). Cleavage of Chromogenic Substrates—The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of LGR-pNA (0.04–5 mm) by FIXa derivatives (20 nm) were studied in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 33% ethylene glycol, and 5 mm Ca2+. In some experiments ethylene glycol was omitted from the buffer. The initial rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature in 96-well plates by a Vmax Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) as described (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). The apparent Km and kcat values for substrate hydrolysis were obtained by non-linear regression fits of data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the catalytic efficiencies were expressed as the ratio of kcat/Km. Factor X Activation by Factor IXa Mutants—The initial rate of FX activation by the wild-type and mutant GD-FIXa derivatives was measured in both the absence and presence of FVIIIa. In the absence of the cofactor, the time course of the initial rate of activation was measured by incubating each FIXa derivative (50 nm) with human FX (2 μm) on PC/PS vesicles (50 μm) in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and 5 mm Ca2+ (TBS/Ca2+) at room temperature. At different time intervals, small aliquots of the activation reactions were transferred into a 96-well assay plate containing Spectrozyme FXa (200 μm in TBS containing 20 mm EDTA, and in a 100-μl final volume). The initial rate of activation was determined by measuring the increase in amidolytic activity of the samples toward SpFXa as monitored at 405 nm by a Vmax Kinetic Microplate Reader. The concentrations of FXa generated in the activation reactions were determined from a standard curve prepared from the cleavage rate of SpFXa by known concentrations of plasma FXa under exactly the same conditions (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). In the presence of factor VIIIa, the activation of factor X by the FIXa derivatives on phospholipid vesicles was evaluated by incubating each FIXa (20 nm) with varying concentrations of human FVIIIa (7.8–500 nm) on 50 μm PC/PS vesicles in TBS/Ca2+ at room temperature. The activation reactions were initiated by addition of 1 μm human FX and allowed to proceed for 60 min, following which they were terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. The rate of FXa generation was measured from the cleavage rate of SpFXa as described above. The apparent Kd for the factor VIIIa-FIXa interaction and maximal FX activation rate for wild-type and variant FIXas were determined by non-linear regression fits of data by a hyperbolic kinetic equation (30Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). Reaction with Antithrombin—The rate of inactivation of FIXa derivatives by AT in both the absence and presence of unfractionated full-length heparin and the pentasaccharide fragment of heparin were measured under pseudo-first-order conditions by a discontinuous assay as described previously (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). In the absence of a cofactor, each FIXa derivative (10 nm) was incubated with AT (0.5–2.0 μm) in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 30–120 min. All reactions were carried out in 50-μl volumes in 96-well polystyrene assay plates at room temperature. In the presence of pentasaccharide, the reaction conditions were the same except that FIXa derivatives were incubated with AT (50–400 nm) in complex with a saturating concentration of pentasaccharide (1 μm) for 0.5–120 min. In the presence of full-length heparin, each FIXa derivative (10 nm) was incubated with 200 nm AT in the presence of catalytic levels of heparin (0.6–10 nm) for 10 s to 50 min in the same TBS buffer system. All reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μl of LGR-pNA (final concentration of 1.0 mm) in TBS containing 1 mg/ml Polybrene. The remaining enzyme activity was measured with a Vmax Kinetics Microplate Reader at 405 nm as described above. The observed pseudo-first-order inactivation rate constants (kobs) were determined by fitting the time-dependent change of the protease activity to a first-order rate equation. Second-order rate constants (k2) were obtained from the slopes of linear plots of kobsversus the concentration of AT or AT-heparin complex as described (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). The AT-heparin complex concentrations were calculated from the dissociation constant for the AT-heparin interaction and total concentrations of AT and heparin using the quadratic equation as described (35Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Google Scholar). Inhibition by p-Aminobenzamidine—The Ki value for p-aminobenzamidine interaction with the active-site pocket of wild-type and mutant GD-IXa derivatives was evaluated. In all cases, GD-FIXa (20 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor (0–320 μm) in the presence of different fixed concentrations of LGR-pNA (312–2500 μm) in TBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 33% ethylene glycol, and 5 mm Ca2+. The enzyme activity was measured from the initial cleavage rate of the chromogenic substrate as described above and the Ki values were determined by global fitting of data to a kinetic equation for competitive inhibition as described (36Rezaie A.R. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 89: 112-121Google Scholar). Expression, Purification, and Activation of Recombinant Proteins—Wild-type and Ala substitution mutants of FIX in Gla-domainless forms were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as in previous studies (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins under non-reducing conditions indicated that the isolated proteins are relatively pure and that they all migrate with similar expected molecular masses of ∼60 kDa suggesting that 293 cells properly processed the recombinant proteins (Fig. 1). All GD-FIX derivatives were activated by RVV-X and, following their purification on a heparin-Sepharose column as described (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Google Scholar), were found to be fully active based on active-site titrations with AT in the presence of pentasaccharide. Amidolytic Activity—Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate LGR-pNA by FIXa derivatives are presented in Table I. Wild-type and mutant GD-FIXa derivatives exhibited similar or slightly improved kcat and Km values toward LGR-pNA in both the absence (data not shown) and presence of the activator, ethylene glycol (Table I). The mutagenesis of basic residues of the autolysis loop thus has no apparent adverse effect on the S3–S1 substrate binding pockets of FIXa mutants. In agreement with this finding, Ki values for the interaction of all mutants with the S1 site-specific competitive inhibitor of serine proteases, p-aminobenzamidine, were comparable to or slightly improved relative to the wild-type enzyme (Table I). Previous mutagenesis studies of basic residues of the autolysis loop of FXa yielded similar results (30Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). Because the residues under study are solvent-exposed in the crystal structure of human FIXa (13Hopfner K.-P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. Structure. 1999; 7: 989-996Google Scholar), their mutagenesis is not expected to affect the catalytic pocket of FIXa.Table IKinetic constants for the cleavage of LGR-pNA by FIXa derivatives and for competitive inhibition of the enzymes by p-aminobenzamidineKmkcatkcat/KmKi (PAB)mMs-1mM-1 s-1μMpIXa2.3 ± 0.113.2 ± 0.45.7 ± 0.4NDaND, not determined.GD-IXa2.0 ± 0.213.2 ± 0.46.6 ± 0.953 ± 2R143A1.2 ± 0.110.7 ± 0.28.9 ± 0.940 ± 1K147A2.2 ± 0.115.6 ± 0.57.1 ± 0.538 ± 1R150A2.0 ± 0.213.4 ± 0.56.7 ± 0.944 ± 3a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Factor X Activation—The catalytic properties of FIXa derivatives toward activation of the natural substrate FX was studied in both the absence and presence of FVIIIa and Ca2+ on PC/PS vesicles. The time course of FX activation in the absence of the cofactor indicated that GD-FIXa can convert FX to FXa at a very slow rate. Under the experimental conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” (2 μm FX and 50 nm FIXa), similar initial rates of ∼0.03 nm FXa/min were found for the wild-type and the R150A mutant of GD-FIXa. However, under the same conditions, the initial rate of FX generation by both R143A and K147A mutants (∼0.005 nm/min) was impaired ∼6-fold. The initial rates of FX activation by all GD-FIXa derivatives were 7- to 8-fold slower in the absence than in the presence of PC/PS vesicles. The ability of GD-FIXa derivatives to activate FX in the presence of FVIIIa was also evaluated. To determine the effect of deleting the Gla domain on the high affinity interaction of FIXa with FVIIIa, the rate of FX activation by plasma FIXa and recombinant GD-FIXa derivatives were compared in the presence of increasing concentrations of FVIIIa on PC/PS vesicles. Interestingly, relative to full-length plasma FIXa, the apparent Kd for the interaction of wild-type GD-FIXa with FVIIIa (82.7 nm) was weakened only 3.5-fold (Fig. 2 and Table II). However, the rate of FXa generation by GD-FIXa was dramatically impaired (Fig. 2). In the presence of a saturating concentration of FVIIIa, the maximum rate of activation with the plasma-derived FIXa (211.8 nm/min/nm) was 20,000-fold hi"
https://openalex.org/W2061723460,"RhoGTPases are central switches in all eukaryotic cells. There are at least two known families of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that can activate RhoGTPases: the Dbl-like eukaryotic G nucleotide exchange factors and the SopE-like toxins of pathogenic bacteria, which are injected into host cells to manipulate signaling. Both families have strikingly different sequences, structures, and catalytic core elements. This suggests that they have emerged by convergent evolution. Nevertheless, both families of G nucleotide exchange factors also share some similarities: (a) both rearrange the G nucleotide binding site of RhoGTPases into virtually identical conformations, and (b) two SopE residues (Gln-109SopE and Asp-124SopE) engage Cdc42 in a similar way as equivalent residues of Dbl-like G nucleotide exchange factors (i.e. Asn-810Dbs and Glu-639Dbs). The functional importance of these observations has remained unclear. Here, we have analyzed the effect of amino acid substitutions at selected SopE residues implicated in catalysis (Asp-124SopE, Gln-109SopE, Asp-103SopE, Lys-198SopE, and Gly-168SopE) on in vitro catalysis of G nucleotide release from Cdc42 and on in vivo activity. Substitutions at Asp-124SopE, Gln-109SopE, and Gly-168SopE severely reduced the SopE activity. Slight defects were observed with Asp-103SopE variants, whereas Lys-198SopE was not found to be required in vitro or in vivo. Our results demonstrate that G nucleotide exchange by SopE involves both catalytic elements unique to the SopE family (i.e. 166GAGA169 loop, Asp-103SopE) and amino acid contacts resembling those of key residues of Dbl-like guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Therefore, besides all of the differences, the catalytic mechanisms of the SopE and the Dbl families share some key functional aspects. RhoGTPases are central switches in all eukaryotic cells.

Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins of the Rho subfamily (RhoGTPases) are key regulators in all eukaryotic cells (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A.

Like all members of the Ras superfamily, RhoGTPases can switch between a GDP-bound “inactive” conformation and a GTP-bound “active” conformation, which generates responses until GTP hydrolysis returns them to the GDP-bound inactive conformation (3Bourne H.R.

Three regions of the RhoGTPases (switch I (Cdc4226–45), switch II (Cdc4259–74), P loop), and a Mg2+ ion mediate high affinity G nucleotide binding (5Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J.

This confirmed that SopE uses the same catalytic principle as Dbl-like GEFs.Based on the mechanism of Dbl-like guanine nucleotide exchange (13Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and the structure of the SopE-Cdc42 complex, we have proposed a mechanism for the GEF activity of SopE (26Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galan J.E. Hardt W.D. Wittinghofer A. Scheffzek K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Most strikingly, SopE inserts the 166GAGA169 loop between switch I/II regions of Cdc42, and a SopEG168A mutant retains less than 1% of its catalytic activity (26Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galan J.E. Hardt W.D. Wittinghofer A. Scheffzek K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the nucleotide-free complex (which contains a sulfate ion that might mimic a bound β-phosphate), the displacement of switch I/II of Cdc42 is stabilized by SopE residues, including the side chains of Asp-124SopE, Lys-198SopE, Asp-103SopE, and Gln-109SopE (Fig. 1b). Many of the amino acids located at the SopE-Cdc42 interface are conserved between all members of the SopE family (Fig. 1a).SopE and Dbl-like GEFs employ different amino acids to stabilize the rearranged switch I/II regions. Nevertheless, two residues of SopE engage Cdc42 in a similar fashion as analogous residues of Dbl-like GEFs; Asp-124SopE and Glu-1047Tiam1/Glu-639Dbs/Glu-1244Intersectin form equivalent polar contacts with Tyr-32Cdc42/Rac1/RhoA, Thr-35Cdc42/Rac1/RhoA, and Val-36Cdc42/Rac1/RhoA (Cdc42 numbering; Tyr-34, Thr-37, and Val-38 in RhoA), whereas Gln-109SopE and Asn-1232Tiam1/Asn-810Dbs/Asn-1421Intersectin form equivalent polar contacts with Asp-65Cdc42/Rac1/RhoA and Arg-66Cdc42/Rac1/RhoA (Cdc42 numbering) (Table I) (12Rossman K.L.

Moreover, these proposed mechanistic similarities were based on the structure of the nucleotide-free Cdc42-SopE complex. We do not know how closely the determined structure of this complex resembles the transition state(s) of the rate-limiting step(s) of the G nucleotide release reaction. Therefore, the catalytic role of the SopE residues required further functional analysis.Table IEquivalent amino acid contacts in SopE-like and Dbl-like GEFsRhoGTPaseaThe complexes were as follows: SopE-Cdc42, Tiam1-Rac1, Dbs-Cdc42 (1), Dbs-RhoA (2), and Intersectin-Cdc42 (the numbering is according to the SopE-Cdc42 complex)ContactSopEQ109Tiam1N1232DbsN810 (1)DbsN810 (2)IntersectinN1421RhoGTPaseContactSopED124Tiam1E1047DbsE639 (1)DbsE639 (2)IntersectinE1244aa 64 (backbone)C...OE13.023.253.303.523.61aa 32 (side chain)OH...OD12.532.472.612.71(4.60)aa 65 (backbone)N...OE13.153.643.463.683.92aa 35 (backbone)N...OD12.853.08/2.74cFor N...OE22.75/3.06cFor N...OE22.92/3.17cFor N...OE23.23/3.03dFor OG1...OE1aa 65 (side chain)OD2...NE23.122.783.073.063.27bIf NH2 and O are switched in the intersectin Asn-1421aa 66 (backbone)N...OE12.793.012.863.162.96bIf NH2 and O are switched in the intersectin Asn-1421aa 36 (backbone)N...OD22.852.502.752.78(3.63)a The complexes were as follows: SopE-Cdc42, Tiam1-Rac1, Dbs-Cdc42 (1), Dbs-RhoA (2), and Intersectin-Cdc42 (the numbering is according to the SopE-Cdc42 complex)b If NH2 and O are switched in the intersectin Asn-1421c For N...OE2d For OG1...OE1 Open table in a new tab In this study, we have mutated specific amino acids of SopE to explore their role in G nucleotide exchange. The SopE mutants were analyzed in vitro using G nucleotide exchange assays and in tissue culture cell infection assays. The 166GAGA169 loop, Asp-124SopE, Asp-103SopE, and Gln-109SopE were found to be important for catalysis. These residues are highly conserved among all members of the SopE family. Interestingly, the residues Asp-124SopE and Gln-109SopE have functional equivalents in Dbl-like GEFs, whereas the 166GAGA169 loop is a unique feature of SopE-like GEFs. Therefore, despite all of the differences in structure, amino acid sequence, and catalytic core, both families of GEFs employ several equivalent amino acid interactions to stabilize the rearranged switch I and switch II region of RhoGTPases and accelerate G nucleotide release.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains—S. typhimurium strain M516 (SL1344, ΔsopB, sopE::aphT, sopE2::tetr), an isogenic derivative of the virulent wild-type strain SL1344 (27Hoiseth S.K.

Friebel A. Linder S. Rohde M. Mirold S. Hardt W.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1206-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), a pBAD24 derivative, which expresses M45-tagged SopE (SopE1–240-M45) under the control of its native sopE promoter using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, we designed complementary primers carrying base changes to introduce the desired single amino acid changes or deletions (Table II). Mutant strand synthesis was achieved by thermal cycling (denaturation 95 °C/30 s, 12–18 cycles; 95 °C/30 s, 55 °C/1 min, 68 °C/13 min). The parental DNA template was digested with DpnI (0.2 units/μl, 1 h/37 °C), and the mutated plasmid was transformed into XL-1-Blue E. coli cells. The transformed XL-1-Blue cells were selected for growth on ampicillin-containing agar plates. The mutated plasmids were isolated, and their sequence was verified by sequencing. Finally, pM136 and the mutated derivatives (coding for wild type SopE1–240-M45 and variants thereof) were digested with Eco47III/SalI, and the inserts, including the native sopE promoter and the M45-tagged sopE allele, were cloned into the EcoRV/SalI sites of pACYC184 (29Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J.

Briefly, all proteins used in this study were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 carrying derivatives of the pGEX expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) as GST fusion proteins, recovered from bacterial extracts by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were either eluted with 20 mm glutathione (GST-SopE′ and variants thereof) or cleaved off of the column by digestion with thrombin protease (SopE′ and variants thereof, Cdc42, Cdc42′, and Cdc42D65A). All steps of the purification were performed in buffers containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Purified proteins were dialyzed against the same buffer containing only 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, concentrated by ultrafiltration (M r cut-off 8000), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The purity of the protein preparations was assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2).

SopE78–240 and variants thereof carry the additional N-terminal amino acids GS; Cdc42 and Cdc42D65A carry the N-terminal amino acids GSRRASVGSKIISA. Cdc42′ (residues 1–178) carries two additional N-terminal residues (GS), and the 13 C-terminal amino acids (PPEPKKSRRCVLL) are absent.To test the stability of the preparations of SopE′ and GST-SopE′ and variants thereof, a 60 μm solution of the proteins in buffer S (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) was incubated at 25 °C, and at several time points between 45 min and 48 h, precipitated material was removed by centrifugation, and 1-μl aliquots of the soluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue.Preparation of the Cdc42-mGDP Complex—Cdc42, Cdc42′, and Cdc42D65A were loaded with O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-GDP (mGDP) essentially as described for Rac1-mGDP (25Friebel A.

Briefly, GST-SopE′ was bound to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. Cdc42 in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) was loaded to the column, and unbound Cdc42 was removed by extensive washing with buffer A. The Cdc42 bound to GST-SopE′ was eluted as a Cdc42-mGDP complex with 180 μm mGDP in buffer A and separated from free mGDP by gel filtration chromatography. Fractions containing Cdc42-mGDP were identified by fluorescence spectroscopy, pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore Ultrafree-15; M r cut-off 8000), snap-frozen, and stored at -80 °C.Fluorescence Spectrometry—All fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C in buffer S (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) on a MOS-450/AF-CD kinetic spectropolarimeter (Bio-Logic). For all kinetic measurements, the time courses of mGDP release from Cdc42 or Cdc42′ in the presence of 1 mm nonfluorescent GDP were monitored as decreased fluorescence (excitation at 366 nm, 8-nm bandwidth) using a 400-nm long pass filter. For analysis of Michaelis-Menten parameters k cat and K m in multiple turnover reactions, increasing concentrations of Cdc42′-mGDP (final concentration of 1–75 μm) were premixed with unlabeled GDP (1 mm final concentration). The reactions were started by the addition of SopE′, GST-SopE′, or variants thereof (final concentrations of 25 or 100 nm), and the decrease of mant fluorescence was recorded.For measurement of the single turnover kinetics of SopE′-catalyzed nucleotide release, increasing concentrations of SopE′, GST-SopE′, or variants thereof (final concentration, 1–22.5 μm) in the presence of unlabeled GDP (final concentration, 1 mm) were mixed with Cdc42-mGDP or Cdc42′-mGDP (final concentration, 75 nm) at 20 °C in buffer S using an SFM-20 stopped flow device (Bio-Logic) attached to the MOS-450/AF-CD spectrometer, and release of mGDP from Cdc42 or Cdc42′ was monitored. Single turnover kinetics with the “slow” variants of SopE′ or GST-SopE′ were measured by the addition of increasing concentrations of SopE (final concentration of 0.5–30 μm) to Cdc42-mGDP (final concentration of 75 or 750 nm) in the presence of 1 mm GDP and following the dissociation of mGDP from Cdc42 by fluorescence spectrometry. Single exponentials were fitted to all kinetic data using the program Biokine (Bio-Logic).Far-UV CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra of the variants of SopE′ and GST-SopE′ (1–1.6 μm in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) were recorded at room temperature on the MOS-450/AF-CD in the spectropolarimeter mode. Sensitivity was set to 100 millidegrees, and spectra were taken with a scan speed of 12 nm/min and a bandwith of 1 nm in a 2-mm quartz cuvette. The spectra were accumulated twice, corrected for background, and converted to mean residue ellipticities according to Schmid (31Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach.

Here we report that wild type MobA can be copurified along with bound MPT and MGD, demonstrating a tight binding of both its substrate and product. To study structure-function relationships, we have constructed a number of site-specific mutations of the most highly conserved amino acid residues of the MobA protein family. Variant MobA proteins were characterized for their ability to support the synthesis of active molybdenum enzymes, to bind MPT and MGD, to interact with the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis proteins MobB and MoeA. They were also characterized by x-ray structural analysis. Our results suggest an essential role for glycine 15 of MobA, either for GTP binding and/or catalysis, and an involvement of glycine 82 in the stabilization of the product-bound form of the enzyme.

The transition metal molybdenum is an essential element for most living organisms. It is required for the activities of a range of enzymes that catalyze two electron redox reactions (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). Molybdenum in these enzymes is always found coordinated to an organic cofactor, which in its most simple form is molybdopterin (MPT). 1The abbreviations used are: MPT, molybdopterin; MGD, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. The biosynthesis of MPT is by an evolutionarily conserved multistep pathway.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The second stage is the introduction of two sulfur atoms into the pyran ring of precursor Z to give MPT (9Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The third step is the chelation of molybdenum and the formation of active Moco. Whereas in eukaryotes this step is catalyzed by two domain proteins (Cnx1 in plants, gephyrin in mammals), in bacteria the separate MogA and MoeA proteins have been implicated in this latter step (5Liu M.T.W.

A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unique to prokaryotes, a further modification of the basic MPT structure by attachment of a mononucleotide to the terminal phosphate of MPT occurs (14Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification is essential for the activity of most, but not all, bacterial Moco-containing enzymes. In Escherichia coli, most of the molybdoenzymes require the GMP-modified form of molybdopterin, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (MGD) for their activity, although enzymes from other bacteria that utilize molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide have also been reported (14Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dobbek H. Gremer L. Meyer O. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8884-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the GMP attachment step is catalyzed by the cellular protein MobA (16Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutants in mobA fail to synthesize MGD and accumulate elevated quantities of MPT (14Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli mobA gene is cotranscribed with a further gene, mobB, encoding a nucleotide-binding protein, which is not absolutely required for MGD synthesis (17Iobbi-Nivol C. Palmer T. Whitty P.W. McNairn E. Boxer D.H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Palmer T. Santini C.-L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent work has suggested that in vivo, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis most probably occurs on protein complexes rather than by the separate action of the biosynthetic enzymes (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In particular it seems that molybdenum insertion and nucleotide attachment to form MGD in E. coli are intimately linked. Using a two-hybrid approach, it has been shown that the MobA protein can interact with the MoeA and MobB proteins. Furthermore, the interaction of MobA with MoeA is only observed in cells that can synthesize MPT-molybdenum, suggesting that a protein-bound form of MPT-molybdenum is delivered to MobA for GMP attachment (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others (20Stevenson C.E.M. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Lake M.W. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have reported the crystal structure of MobA. Consistent with its known function, the protein shares striking homology with sugar-nucleotide phosphotransferases. The MobA enzyme, which is active as a monomer, has an overall α/β architecture where the N-terminal half of the molecule adopts a Rossman fold. Soaking with high concentrations of GTP and divalent metal ions has revealed that this N-terminal region contains the GTP binding site (21Lake M.W. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using a fully defined in vitro system, it has been demonstrated that MobA alone, when incubated with GTP, Mg2+ and a source of MPT catalyzes the formation of MGD, indicating that it is both necessary and sufficient for GMP attachment (22Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study we have sought to further explore the biochemical properties of MobA. We show that the wild type protein, as purified, contains bound MPT and MGD in the ratio of 1:3. Based on sequence comparisons and the high resolution x-ray structure, we have constructed a number of site-directed variants of the E. coli MobA protein. Our biochemical and structural analyses indicate an essential role for glycine 15 in the conversion of MPT to MGD and of glycine 82 in stabilizing the product-bound form of the enzyme. Inactive variant forms of MobA do not lose the ability to interact with MobB and MoeA in the two-hybrid system, indicating that the area of interaction is distinct from the catalytic site. Materials—All chemicals used were from the highest grade available. Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.22) from buttermilk grade I was obtained from Sigma. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow matrix was from Qiagen. Prepacked PD10 gel filtration columns were used as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids, Media, and Growth Conditions—Plasmid pTPEC3 (20Stevenson C.E.M. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar) carries the E. coli mobA gene fused to a 3′ oligohistidine coding sequence in plasmid pKK223–3 (Amersham Biosciences). Site-specific mutations in pTPEC3 were constructed by PCR methods (primer sequences available on request). All mutations constructed by PCR were verified by nucleotide sequencing. MobA proteins were overproduced in the following strains MC4100 (F–, ΔlacU169, ara139, rpsL150, relA1, ptsF, rbs, flbB5301) (23Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or M15[pREP4] (F –, lac, ara, gal, mtl (KanR , lacI +; Qiagen), as indicated in the text. Strain DH5α (φ80dlacZΔM15, recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, hsdR17(rK–,mK+) supE44, relA1, deoR, Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169) (Promega) was used for cloning. Strain BTH101 (F′, cya-99, araD139, galE15, galK16, rpsL1(StrR), hsdR2, mcrA1, mcrB1; Ref. 24Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 59-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine two-hybrid interactions. The mutant mobA genes encoding the G15L, K25A, G82L, and D101N alleles were amplified by PCR and cloned into plasmid pT18 (Ref. 24Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 59-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; primer sequences available on request). Strains were cultured in LB medium, supplemented with antibiotics (kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; ampicillin, 125 μg/ml) as required. For the measurement of β-galactosidase activities, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was included in the growth medium (25Miller J.H. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar), and the cells were cultured at 30 °C. In vivo interactions of the mutant MobA proteins with MobB and MoeA were as described previously (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For induction of nitrate reductase, 0.4% (w/v) sodium nitrate was added, and the cultures were incubated anaerobically (18Palmer T. Santini C.-L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant MobA Proteins—For MPT/MGD copurification, MobA proteins were expressed in 100-ml cultures, which were inoculated with 50 μl of a stationary phase culture and were grown aerobically for 16 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and lysed by sonication. The crude cell extract, which was prepared after centrifugation (26Eaves D.J. Palmer T. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was loaded onto a 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column that had been previously pre-equilibrated with washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol). After loading, the column was washed with eight column volumes of washing buffer and the bound protein eluted by application of 3 column volumes of washing buffer supplemented with a further 480 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was applied immediately onto a 10-ml PD10 desalting column that had been previously equilibrated with desalting buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). Protein was washed through the column with the same buffer and stored at 4 °C prior to MPT/MGD assay. For crystallization, MobA proteins were overproduced in strain M15[pREP4] and purified as described previously (20Stevenson C.E.M. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Purity of protein samples was assessed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Bradford (29Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Nitrate Reductase Assay—Nitrate reductase activity from crude cell extracts of anaerobic nitrate-grown strains was measured by the continuous method of Jones and Garland (30Jones R.W. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Determination of MPT and MGD Content—Molybdenum cofactor forms were determined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis following oxidation to the defined oxidation products form A (from MPT) and form A-GMP (from MGD). Total molybdenum cofactor (MPT plus MGD) was determined by boiling purified MobA fractions in the presence of acidic iodine. Separate MPT and MGD content of purified protein was determined after room temperature oxidation with acidic iodine. Both methods were as described previously (31Buchanan G. Kuper J. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Palmer T. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Assays were routinely performed using 400 μl (typically 800 μg) of purified MobA proteins. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the MobA variants were obtained and cryoprotected as described previously for the wild type (20Stevenson C.E.M. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar). X-ray data were recorded at a temperature of 100 K at the Synchrotron Radiation Source in Daresbury, United Kingdom, either on station PX9.5 using a 165-mm MAR-Research charge-coupled device (CCD) detector or on station PX9.6 using an Area Detector Systems Corp. Quantum 4 CCD detector. The resultant data were scaled and merged using the HKL package (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar), and all subsequent downstream processing and statistical analysis was effected using programs from the CCP4 suite (33Collaborative Computational Project No.4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). X-ray data collection parameters are summarized in Table I. Given that all crystals were isomorphous with the wild type crystals (20Stevenson C.E.M. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Struct.

After rigid body refinement to convergence the structures were subjected to restrained refinement with REFMAC5 (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

After the final refinement cycle the resultant structures were evaluated using PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallgor. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Model parameters are summarized in Table I. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the E. coli mobA Gene—Based on protein sequence alignments (Fig. 1), a number of amino acid residues are completely conserved across the MobA family of proteins. Many of these highly conserved residues fall in the putative substrate binding pocket of the E. coli MobA protein that has been identified previously (20Stevenson C.E.M. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Palmer T. Lawson D.M. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Lake M.W. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40211-40217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To probe the functions of these residues, we have constructed a number of site-directed mutations in the mobA gene (Fig. 1). Conserved residues Arg19, Lys25, Asp101, and Arg156 were initially substituted by alanine, the conserved glycine residues (Gly15, Gly22, Gly78, and Gly82), were substituted by leucine, and the two invariant asparagines (Asn180 and Asn182) were replaced singly and in combination by aspartate. To test the effect of the mutations on the ability of the cell to synthesize active molybdenum cofactor in vivo, we measured the specific nitrate reductase activity of the mobAB mutant with plasmids encoding the histidine-tagged wild type or variant proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, only two mutations led to a complete loss of MobA function. Substitution of glycine 15 for leucine (G15L), or aspartate 101 for alanine (D101A), totally abolished MobA activity. However, further analysis of the D101A mutation indicated that most of the protein was present in the cells in the form of inclusion bodies, which could account for the lack of activity. Therefore we made a further substitution of aspartate 101 for asparagine (D101N). The mob mutant expressing D101N showed reduced, but still detectable, nitrate reductase activity. Of the other point mutations, the mob mutant expressing the K25A-substituted protein repeatedly showed lower nitrate reductase activity. The other mutations gave essentially similar levels of active nitrate reductase as the wild type protein. Copurification of Molybdenum Cofactor Forms with His-tagged MobA—We next wanted to study individual activities of the purified proteins to understand which of the functional properties of MobA were affected by the mutations. As a consequence of the reaction catalyzed by MobA it should interact with its substrates (MPT, GTP) as well with the reaction product (MGD). We have shown previously that the G-domain of the MPT-binding protein Cnx1 (12Schwarz G. Boxer D.H. Mendel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26811-26814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), as purified from E. coli, contains bound MPT (13Kuper J. Palmer T. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6475-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that the purified wild type MobA protein may also contain one or more forms of bound molybdenum cofactor. Consistent with this, we were able to demonstrate that the histidine-tagged wild type protein could be copurified with up to 50 pmol of molybdenum cofactor/mg of protein (1.1 mmol Moco/mol of MobA). When the analysis was repeated under conditions of mild oxidation (that prevents cleavage of the phosphodiester bond), it was apparent that most of the bound molybdenum cofactor was in the form of the reaction product, MGD (Fig. 3B). We typically observed a ratio of MPT:MGD of 1:3 for the wild type protein. We next expressed and purified the variant MobA proteins. All of the His-tagged variant proteins (apart from the D101A variant) were expressed to a similar level and were isolated to the same degree of purity as the His-tagged wild type MobA (Fig. 3A). Total Moco analysis revealed that each of the amino acid substituted proteins was also capable of binding and copurifying the cofactor (data not shown). The isolated proteins were subsequently treated to mildly oxidizing conditions (Fig. 3B) to compare the ratio of bound substrate (MPT) and product (MGD). Total Moco (MPT + MGD) bound to two of the variant proteins, K25A and R156A, was routinely significantly lower than that of the wild type, and a number of the variant MobA proteins, particularly G15L, G22L, G82L, and D101N, showed elevated levels of total Moco. When comparing the ratios of bound MPT:MGD shown in Fig 3B, several of the substituted proteins had similar ratios to the wild type protein. These included the R19A, R156A, N180D, N182D, and N180,182D (marked as NNDD in Fig. 3B) amino acid replacements. These results are consistent with our earlier observations that expression of these variant forms of MobA gave wild type levels of nitrate reductase activity (Fig. 2). However, a number of the substituted proteins showed differing ratios of bound substrate and product than the wild type protein. The G22L substitution routinely showed an increase in the amount of bound MGD relative to wild type (Fig 3B). This observation suggests that the G22L form of the protein may have an increased affinity for the reaction product. The K25A, G78L, and D101N versions of MobA led to a notable increase in the ratio of bound MPT relative to MGD. Taken together with the observation that both the K25A and D101N replacements resulted in a marked decrease in the level of nitrate reductase activity (Fig. 2), this indicates that the altered MPT:MGD ratio is of functional significance. G15L was the only modified form of MobA that showed a complete absence of nitrate reductase activity, consistent with an inability to synthesize MGD. However, the G15L variant of MobA, as purified, contained a relatively high amount of bound MPT. This may be due to the fact that there are higher levels of MPT in the cell when MobA is inactive (14Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which probably accounts for the relatively high amount of MPT bound. This supports the idea that the defect in the G15L variant is not at the level of MPT binding, but must instead be at the level of binding of the other substrate (GTP) or at the catalytic step. The leucine side chain probably partially occludes the guanine binding pocket or alternatively disrupts the local structure sufficiently to prevent GTP binding. To ascertain whether this MobA variant was capable of interacting with the reaction product, we expressed the plasmid-encoded His-tagged G15L MobA protein in a strain carrying the wild type chromosomal copy of mobA. As shown in Table II, under these circumstances, the G15L protein could also interact with MGD. It is notable that this variant only binds half the wild type level of MGD. This is presumably due to a lower affinity of the variant MobA protein for the product resulting from occlusion or disruption of the guanine binding pocket.Table IIThe MobA G15L variant is able to bind MGD when expressed in a wild type strainStrainAmo"

The resulting transconjugant strain of Rs. rubrum grows photosynthetically, showing that phytolated Bchla can substitute for the native pigment in both the reaction center (RC) and the light-harvesting 1 (LH1) complexes. This genetic manipulation perturbs the native carotenoid biosynthetic pathway; several biosynthetic intermediates are assembled into the core complex and are capable of energy transfer to the bacteriochlorophylls. RC-LH1 complexes containing phytolated Bchla were analyzed by low temperature absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. These show that phytolated Bchls can assemble in vivo into the photosynthetic apparatus of Rs. rubrum and that the newly introduced phytol tail provokes small perturbations to the Bchls within their binding sites in the LH1 complex. The RC-LH1 core complex was purified from membranes and reconstituted into well ordered two-dimensional crystals with a p4212 space group. A projection map calculated to 9 Å shows clearly that the LH1 ring from the mutant is composed of 16 subunits that surround the reaction center and that the diameter of this complex is in close agreement with that of the wild-type LH1 complex.

Most photosynthetic organisms use chlorophylls for the capture of light energy and its conversion into a useful form of cellular energy. This molecule consists of two main components, a magnesium-porphyrin macrocyle and a “tail,” which is usually phytol, a C-20 isoprenoid (1Rüdiger W. Schoch S. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 451-464Google Scholar). The combination of these components constitutes the terminal step of the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, which is catalyzed by the BchG enzyme in the photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (2Oster U. Bauer C.E. Rüdiger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9671-9676Google Scholar, 3Addlesee H.A. Fiedor L. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3175-3182Google Scholar). The phytol tail is ∼30% of the total molecular mass of (bacterio)chlorophyll, and, apart from being an important determinant of the hydrophobicity of the Bchl 1The abbreviations used are: Bchl, bacteriochlorophyll; BchlaGG, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with geranylgeraniol; BchlaDHGG, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with dihydrogeranylgeraniol; BchlaTHGG, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with tetrahydrogeranylgeraniol; BchlaP, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with phytol; CTF, contrast transfer function; CD, circular dichroism; DHPC, 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LH1, light-harvesting 1; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PPP, Phytol pyrophosphate; RC, reaction center. 1The abbreviations used are: Bchl, bacteriochlorophyll; BchlaGG, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with geranylgeraniol; BchlaDHGG, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with dihydrogeranylgeraniol; BchlaTHGG, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with tetrahydrogeranylgeraniol; BchlaP, bacteriochlorophyll a esterified with phytol; CTF, contrast transfer function; CD, circular dichroism; DHPC, 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LH1, light-harvesting 1; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PPP, Phytol pyrophosphate; RC, reaction center. molecule, it plays an essential role in the assembly and stability of photosynthetic complexes. This was apparent from the early discovery that mutations in bchG abolish the assembly of the bacterial photosynthetic apparatus (4Lascelles J. Altshuler T. Arch. Microbiol. 1967; 59: 204-210Google Scholar). However, the roles of the various esterifying alcohols used in bacterial photosynthesis, which include phytol, geranylgeraniol, and farnesol (1Rüdiger W. Schoch S. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 451-464Google Scholar), are not understood. In this study a molecular genetic approach has been used to alter the esterification of the Bchls in Rhodospirillum rubrum so that BchlaP is used instead of BchlaGG. High resolution crystallographic data of photosynthetic reaction centers have revealed detailed information on the conformation of the phytol tails of bacteriochlorophyll and bacteriopheophytin molecules within this complex (5Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Google Scholar, 6Allen J.P. Feher G. Yeates T.O. Komiya H. Rees D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5730-5734Google Scholar). The conformations of the phytol tails differ between the active and inactive branches of the electron-transferring pigment system in the reaction center, although the significance of this is unclear. In the bacterial light-harvesting LH2 complex, attention has been drawn to the way in which the phytol tails of the B800 and B850 BChls intertwine; such interactions have been proposed to play an important role in establishing fast energy transfer within these complexes by controlling the orientation of the transition dipoles of the Bchl molecule (7Freer A. Prince S. Sauer K. Papiz M. Hawthornthwaite-Lawless A. McDermott G. Cogdell R. Isaacs N. Structure. 1996; 4: 449-462Google Scholar). Phytol is the most common esterifying alcohol of chlorophylls and Bchls (8Scheer H. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 3-30Google Scholar, 9Brown A.E. Lascelles J. Plant Physiol. 1972; 50: 747-749Google Scholar, 10Bollivar D.W. Wang S.J. Allen J.P. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12763-12768Google Scholar). In this respect, Rhodospirillum rubrum differs from other purple bacteria such as Rb. sphaeroides and Rb. capsulatus by employing the less saturated C20 isoprenoid alcohol geranylgeraniol (GG) instead of phytol (11Katz J.J. Strain H.H. Harkness A.L. Studier M.H. Svec W.A. Janson T.R. Cope B.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 7938-7939Google Scholar). BchlaGG is a biosynthetic precursor of BchlaP, and the product of a single gene is responsible for the three steps (Fig. 1A) necessary for reducing BchlaGG to BchlaP (10Bollivar D.W. Wang S.J. Allen J.P. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12763-12768Google Scholar, 12Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Google Scholar, 13Addlesee H.A. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7248-7255Google Scholar). This gene, bchP, encodes the enzyme BchlaGG reductase and resides among other photosynthesis-related genes in a photosynthesis gene cluster (12Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Google Scholar, 14Alberti M. Burke D.H. Hearst J.E. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria.

Homologs of bchP have been found in cyanobacteria and plants, wherein the gene product has been identified as the catalyst for the reduction of the isoprenoid moiety of chlorophyll (Chl) (16Addlesee H.A. Gibson L.C.D. Jensen P.E. Hunter C.N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 126-130Google Scholar, 17Keller Y. Bouvier F. D'Harlingue A. Camara B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 413-417Google Scholar). Previous work has indicated that BchlaGG permits assembly of both LH1 and LH2 in bchP mutants of Rb. capsulatus and Rb. sphaeroides (10Bollivar D.W. Wang S.J. Allen J.P. Bauer C.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12763-12768Google Scholar, 13Addlesee H.A. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7248-7255Google Scholar). However, LH2 is severely affected by this change, whereas LH1 is not. As already noted, Rs. rubrum uses BchlaGG and can be thought of as a naturally occurring BchP mutant (18Addlesee H.A. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1578-1586Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that normal BchP function can be restored to Rs. rubrum, creating a new transconjugant strain possessing Bchl esterified with phytol (18Addlesee H.A. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1578-1586Google Scholar). In this new strain of Rs. rubrum, the new phytolated pigments have been assembled into a reaction center-light-harvesting 1 complex (RC-LH1), but there are no structural or spectroscopic data available for this new reaction center-antenna complex. The LH1 light-harvesting complex of Rs. rubrum is the best characterized of any such complex, with a projection map at 8.5-Å resolution generated from cryo-electron microscopy studies (19Karrasch S. Bullough P.A. Ghosh R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 631-638Google Scholar). More recently, cryo-electron microscopy has also revealed the projection structure of the RC-LHI from Rs. rubrum at 8.5 Å, which shows a single reaction center surrounded by 16 LH1 subunits in a ring of ∼115 Å diameter (20Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Google Scholar). The availability of a transconjugant strain of Rs. rubrum containing phytolated Bchls (18Addlesee H.A. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1578-1586Google Scholar) therefore provides the first opportunity to see how the provision of a different C20 alcohol moiety influences the in vivo assembly, structure, and function of this light-harvesting LH1 complex. Growth of Rs. rubrum and Preparation of Membranes—Cells of Rs. rubrum containing the bchP expression plasmid pSK1bchP (13Addlesee H.A. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7248-7255Google Scholar) were grown photosynthetically at low light intensity (3 watts/m2) at 20 °C in M22+ medium in the presence of 250 ng/ml doxycycline (18Addlesee H.A. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1578-1586Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted, and cell-free intracytoplasmic membrane fractions were isolated as described previously (21Olsen J.D. Sockalingum G.D. Robert B. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7124-7128Google Scholar). Absorbance spectra were recorded on a Cary 500 spectrophotometer. HPLC Analysis of Pigments—Carotenoid pigments were initially extracted into acetone/methanol, 2:1 (v/v), and subsequently transferred into ether by the method of Britton and Riesen (22Britton G. Riesen R. Britton G. Liaaen-Jensen S. Pfander H. Carotenoids. 1A. Birkhäuser Publishing Ltd., Basel, Switzerland1995: 227-238Google Scholar). The samples were then evaporated to dryness under N2, and the pigments were dissolved in ethyl acetate/acetonitrile/water, 10:9:1 (v/v/v). Carotenoids were separated by HPLC on a Spherisorb ODS2 column (4.6ϕ × 250 mm) using a protocol provided by Professor A. Young (Liverpool John Moores University, United Kingdom). The flow rate was 1 ml/min, with an initial solvent composition of 20% ethyl acetate, 72% acetonitrile, and 8% water, changing over the course of 6 min to 60% ethyl acetate, 36% acetonitrile, and 4% water. This solvent composition was maintained for 15 min, during which time the carotenoids eluted. Elution of carotenoids was monitored using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector scanning from 270 to 600 nm every 2 s. Chromatograms at 447 nm were derived from the accumulated absorbance scans using the Millenium software (Waters). Carotenoids were identified by their retention times on the column and their absorbance spectra. Purification of the RC-LH1 Complex—Cells of Rs. rubrum containing pSK1bchP were disrupted using a French press at a pressure of 1450 kg/cm2. The cell extract was applied to the top of a sucrose gradient (15–40% sucrose in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9) and spun at 100,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The clear membrane band just above the 40% sucrose layer was collected, and its protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce and Warriner Ltd., Chester, England). The detergent DHPC (23Kessi J. Ghosh R. Bachofen R. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 353-362Google Scholar) was added to membranes dropwise over 15 min with gentle stirring, with the ratio of 3 mmol of DHPC per microgram of protein in membrane. The solution, after equilibrium for another 30 min, was centrifuged for 1 h at 150,000 × g to remove undissolved material and then purified with a DEAE anion exchange column (20 ϕ × 70 mm). The column was eluted with a gradient of buffer A (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 mm DHPC, pH 7.9) and buffer B (300 mm NaCl in buffer A). The main peak, which contains the RC-LH1 complex, corresponds to 250 mm NaCl. The best fractions judged from the 880:280 nm absorbance ratio (>2.0) were concentrated and loaded on a gel filtration column (Hiload 16/60, Superdex 200 preparative grade). The column was washed by buffer C (50 mm NaCl in Buffer A). Fractions with an 880:280 nm absorbance ratio of more than 2.2 were pooled and used for crystallization. Two-dimensional Crystallization—The purified RC-LH1 sample was concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml protein and then mixed with one of the lipids DOPC, POPC, or POPC-DMPC (4:1; w/w) in a lipid-to-protein ratio from 0.6 to 1.6 (w/w). The final sample, which was used for dialysis, was adjusted to 100 μl with a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The detergent was removed slowly by dialysis against a continuously flowing buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.5). The temperature was controlled as described in Walz et al. (24Walz T. Jamieson S.J. Bowers C.M. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 833-845Google Scholar). After 64 h of dialysis, samples were collected and stored at 4 °C before use. Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—The quality of the two-dimensional crystals was checked by negative staining with 0.75% (w/v) uranyl formate. Electron micrographs were taken with a 1024 × 1024 CCD camera (Gatan) attached to a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV with a nominal magnification of 28,500×. For cryo-electron microscopy, two-dimensional crystals were adsorbed onto a 16 nm-thick carbon film mounted on a molybdenum grid. The grid was washed twice with distilled water followed by 1% glucose. Electron micrographs were taken with a Philips CM200 FEG microscope operated at a 200-kV acceleration voltage with the sample holder (Oxford Instruments) cooled by liquid nitrogen. Low-dose images, about 5–10 e–/Å2 at the specimen, were recorded at a nominal magnification of 50000× on Kodak SO163 film and developed with Kodak D19 for 12 min. Crystalline areas on the film were checked roughly by optical diffraction, and the well ordered areas were digitized with a Zeiss SCAI scanner using a step size of 7 μm per pixel. The MRC image processing program package version 2000 was used for data processing (25Henderson H. Downing K. Lepault J. Zemlin F. Ultramicroscopy. 1986; 19: 147-178Google Scholar, 26Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16+Google Scholar). Low Temperature Absorption—The purified RC-LH1 sample was mixed with 80% glycerol solution in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of OD880 = 0.4–0.6 and 60% glycerol. The sample was cooled down slowly under nitrogen gas using an OptistatDN LN-2 cooled bath cryostat (Oxford Instruments) coupled with a temperature detector. After the temperature had stabilized, the cryostat was placed in a Cary 500 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded with a resolution of 0.2 nm. Room temperature spectra of samples were recorded with the same instrument. Fluorescence and CD Spectroscopy—Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of RC-LH1 complexes were measured using a SPEX Fluorolog FL3–22 spectrophotometer (Jobin-Yvon) equipped with xenon excitation and a CCD detector. The sample preparation and cooling procedure were the same as for the absorbance measurements. For excitation spectra, the 425–625 nm excitation range covered the carotenoid and Bchla Qx absorption region; detection of fluorescence emission was at 925 and 917 nm for wild-type and mutant complexes of Rs. rubrum, respectively. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter at room temperature using a 5-mm path length cell with resolution of 0.5 nm. The absorbance of each sample was adjusted to 1.0 in a 1-cm path length at the maximum in the near infrared region. Verification of BchlaP in the Transconjugant Strain of Rs. rubrum Containing bchP—HPLC traces of acetone-methanol extracts from whole cells are shown in Fig. 1B. Under the conditions used, BchlaGG (Fig. 1B, section i) had a retention time of ∼18.4 min compared with 20.7 min for the BchlaP control (Fig. 1B, section ii). The HPLC profile of Bchls from the transconjugant Rs. rubrum (Fig. 1B, section iii) clearly indicates that introducing the bchP gene from Rb. sphaeroides into Rs. rubrum replaces the native BchlaGG with the phytolated pigment. Alteration of BchlaGG to BchlaP Has a Marked Effect on the Carotenoid Composition—The carotenoids in the wild-type Rs. rubrum follow the spirilloxanthin branch of the biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 2A). HPLC analysis of the carotenoids present in the strain of Rs. rubrum, which contained the “empty” pRKSK1 expression plasmid as a control, showed that spirilloxanthin is the major component as expected, along with minor amounts of 3,4-didehydrorhodopin, rhodovibrin, and anhydrorhodovibrin (Fig. 2B, section i). It was noticed that, under photosynthetic conditions, cultures of Rs. rubrum [pSK1bchP] were distinctly red/brown in appearance, in contrast to the normal bright red color found in wild-type or pRKSK1-containing Rs. rubrum. Consistent with this change in color, Rs. rubrum [pSK1bchP] had a significantly altered carotenoid content (Fig. 2B, section ii). Spirilloxanthin was present but did not constitute a significantly greater proportion of the total carotenoid content than many of the other pigments present. The most abundant carotenoid was one of the previously mentioned spirilloxanthin precursors, putatively identified as rhodovibrin; the other carotenoids present appear to include rhodopin, 3,4-didehydrorhodopin, and anhydrorhodovibrin. Spectroscopic Studies of Membranes Containing the BchlaP LH1-RC Mutant Complex from Rs. rubrum—Absorbance spectra of the bacteriochlorophylls within bacterial LH1 complexes are sensitive to the aggregation state and environment of these pigments (21Olsen J.D. Sockalingum G.D. Robert B. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7124-7128Google Scholar, 27Westerhuis W.H. Sturgis J.N. Ratcliffe E.C. Hunter C.N. Niederman R.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8698-8707Google Scholar) and therefore provide essential information on the effects of altering the esterifying pigments within the LH1-RC complexes studied. Low temperature absorbance spectroscopy revealed differences between RC-LH1 core complexes purified from wild-type and transconjugant strains; the Qy absorption maximum of the newly phytolated Bchla molecules within LH1 is slightly blue-shifted in comparison with the native complex containing BchlaGG. At room temperature, this shift is about 2 nm (876 nm to 874 nm; data not shown) and it extends to ∼4 nm (from 894 to 888 nm, see Fig. 3) at 77 K, although the Qx maximum is maintained at these different temperatures. In the visible region, the different carotenoid composition of the mutant apparent from the HPLC analysis in Fig. 2 is manifested as an altered series of absorbance bands. For the purified wild-type complex, the bands at 457 (shoulder), 485, 517, 547, and 568 (shoulder) nm mainly reflect the presence of spirilloxanthin, whereas the increased number of well resolved bands in this region for the mutant at 433, 457 (shoulder), 487, 505, 529, and 549 nm arises from the spirilloxanthin precursor rhodovibrin together with rhodopin, 3,4-didehydrorhodopin, and anhydrorhodovibrin. The absorbance spectrum of the membranes containing the mutant complex is also shown in Fig. 3 for comparison; it demonstrates that the purified complex has retained the features of the membranes from which it was prepared with regard to both the carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll absorbance bands in the visible and near infrared regions of the spectrum, respectively. The blue shift in absorbance for the mutant is reflected in the fluorescence emission spectra. Fluorescence emission spectra of the purified RC-LH1 core complexes recorded at 77K showed a clear difference in emission maximum, with a blue shift of 8 nm in the BchlaP mutant relative to the control (Fig. 4A). To observe any energy transfer from carotenoids to Bchls in the RC-LH1 core complex containing BchlaP, an excitation spectrum of the carotenoid region was recorded (Fig. 4B) with detection of emission from the Bchls. The excitation spectra were normalized to the Bchl Qx band to provide an indication of the relative efficiencies of the energy transfer process. For the wild-type control, three main excitation peaks are observed at 481, 515, and 549 nm in approximate agreement with the absorbance spectra, therefore reflecting the dominance of spirilloxanthin in terms of carotenoid composition. An efficiency of ∼36% can be estimated, which is in reasonable agreement with the figure of ∼35% obtained by Duysens (28.Duysens, L. N. M. (1952) Transfer of Excitation Energy in Photosynthesis. Ph.D. thesis, University of UtrechtGoogle Scholar) and cited in Ref. 29Gradinaru C.C. Kennis J.T.M. Papagiannakis E. van Stokkum I.H.M. Cogdell R.J. Fleming G.R. Niederman R.A. van Grondelle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2364-2369Google Scholar. In contrast, the excitation spectrum of the BchlaP mutant shows six well defined peaks at 432, 457, 487, 503, 529, and 549 nm, reflecting the presence of several carotenoids in this mutant such as rhodovibrin, rhodopin, 3,4-didehydrorhodopin, and anhydrorhodovibrin. CD spectroscopy can provide a very sensitive indicator of alterations in the aggregation state and orientation of bacterial LH complexes (for examples, see Refs. 30Koolhaas M.H.C. van der Zwan G. Frese R.N. van Grondelle R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 7262-7270Google Scholar, 31Koolhaas M.H.C. van der Zwan G. van Mourik F. van Grondelle R. Biophys.

Johnson E. Koolhaas C. Cogdell R.J. van Grondelle R. van der Zwan G. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2184-2197Google Scholar). Near-IR CD spectra of intact membranes containing wild-type and mutant complexes were therefore recorded at room temperature and are presented in Fig. 5B. The corresponding absorbance spectra are shown in Fig. 5A, in which the shift to the blue noted for the purified BchlaP complex in Fig. 3 relative to the WT is also seen for the membrane sample; this time, the shift is 4 nm. Similarly, the CD spectrum of membranes containing the BchlaP RC-LH1 complex was blue-shifted in comparison with the WT. The differences between the CD spectra are the zero crossing points and the peak intensities. The zero crossing point for the WT complex corresponds exactly to the absorbance maximum, whereas in the case of the BchlaP mutant this zero crossing point is blue shifted by 2 nm with respect to absorbance maximum. The peak intensity ratios at 870/897 nm for the mutant and 865/892 for the wild type are similar, and, overall, the shapes of the two spectra differ only slightly. Two-dimensional Crystallization of the RC-LH1 Complex Containing BchlaP—Recent progress in the preparation of RC-LH1 crystals from Rs. rubrum has allowed the projection structure of this complex to be determined at 8.5-Å resolution (20Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3927-3935Google Scholar). This shows a single reaction center surrounded by 16 LH1 subunits in a ring of ∼115-Å diameter. Within each LH1 subunit, densities for the α- and β-polypeptide chains are clearly resolved. The availability of a mutant of Rs. rubrum provided the opportunity to see if alteration of the Bchl tail influences the structure and organization of this complex. The RC-LH1 complex was purified from membranes prepared from the BchlaP-synthesizing strain of Rs. rubrum and used in crystallization trials. The best quality two-dimensional crystals were formed with a DOPC/protein (w/w) ratio of 1.0 after 64 h of dialysis; the typical size of a vesicular crystal was about 1600 × 1600 nm (Fig. 6). The quality of crystal was judged by negative stain electron microscopy with more than four orders of calculated diffraction. All individual images showed that the mutant RC-LH1 core complex forms a two-dimensional crystal with a square lattice and p4212 space group symmetry. The crystals were embedded in glucose and found to be of sufficient quality to use for cryo-electron microscopy; the contrast transfer function (CTF) plot of a Fourier transform of a typical image is shown in Fig. 7.

The densities in the middle are contributed by helices in the reaction center. Three individual unbent, CTF-corrected lattices were merged and p4212 symmetry applied, giving the image in Fig. 8B. A high-resolution map (Fig. 8C) has been calculated with a resolution of 9 Å, and it is clear enough to show that the RC sits in the middle of the ring surrounded by a closed ring of LH1. Rotational power spectrum analysis of the density from Fig. 8B shows a strong 16-fold component far above the noise level (Fig. 8D). The lattice parameters a and b, calculated from high-resolution images, are 168 ± 0.5Å, which corresponds to a molecule diameter of 116 Å. This diameter of the BchlaP LH1 ring is in close agreement with the figure of 115 Å for the wild-type LH1 complex, also determined by cryo-electron microscopy (20Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P.

Alteration of Pigment Synthesis in a Transconjugant Strain of Rs. rubrum Containing the bchP Gene from Rb. sphaeroides and the Effect on Bchls and Carotenoids—We recently demonstrated that the BchP enzyme of Rb. sphaeroides converts BpheaGG to BpheaP as well as BchlaGG to BchlaP, whereas BchP of Rs. rubrum is restricted to the former of these activities (18Addlesee H.A. Hunter C.N. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1578-1586Google Scholar). As such, Rs. rubrum is a naturally occurring bchP mutant. In addition, it was shown that introducing the Rb. sphaeroides bchP gene into Rs. rubrum generates a novel transconjugant strain in which the Bchls are esterified with phytol. Given that the LH1 antenna complex of Rs. rubrum has been heavily studied using structural, spectroscopic, and reconstitution techniques (for example, Refs. 19Karrasch S. Bullough P.A. Ghosh R.

Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL) is built from two structural domains that interact through interface residues, in addition to being connected by a peptide linker. For the first time we demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal domains of SpnHL fold/unfold independent of each other suggesting the absence of any significant cooperative interactions between them. The C-terminal domain of SpnHL is less stable than the N-terminal domain against thermal and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. The intact N-terminal domain was purified after limited proteolysis of SpnHL under conditions where only the C-terminal domain was unfolded. Isolated N-terminal domain of SpnHL had similar thermal stability as when present in the native enzyme and was found to be enzymatically active demonstrating that it is capable of carrying out enzymatic reaction on its own. Functional studies demonstrated that guanidine hydrochloride, guanidine isothiocyanate, l-arginine methyl ester, and l-arginine inhibit the enzymatic activity of SpnHL at very low concentrations. This provides a lead for new chemical entities that can be exploited for designing effective inhibitors of SpnHL.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that colonizes predominantly in the upper respiratory tract of humans. It is one of the key causes of life threatening disease such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis (1Mufson M.A. Mandell G.L. Douglas Jr., R.G. Bennett J.E. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. Publisher, Location of Publisher1990: 1539-1550Google Scholar) and less dangerous but significantly more prevalent diseases like sinusitis or otitis media (2Jonston Jr., R.B. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1991; 13: S509-S517Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The groups of human population especially affected by this organism are infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (3Musher D.M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1991; 14: 801-807Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 4Gray B.M. Converse III, G.M. Dillion Jr., H.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1980; 142: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Hyaluronidases constitute a special group of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes that have the ability to degrade primarily hyaluronan (HA), 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; SpnHL, S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; C m, denaturant concentration where 50% denaturation of protein is observed; GdnHSCN, guanidine isothiocyanate; l-NAME, N w-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; T m, mid-point of thermal denaturation. yielding various lengths of oligosaccharides as the end product (5Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The bacterial hyaluronidases are called hyaluronate lyase. Various Gram-positive microorganisms including species of Streptococcus, Clostridium, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, and Peptostreptococcus produce hyaluronate lyase (6Park Y. Cho S. Linhardt R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This enzyme is either cell-associated or released outside of cell. It primarily degrades hyaluronan and certain chondroitin sulfates, the major components of host extracellular matrix of tissue (5Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 7Boulnois G.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Jedrzejas M.K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 65: 187-207Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The HA degradation directly contributes to bacterial invasion by allowing greater microbial access to, or migration between, host tissues for colonization (8Jedrzejas M.K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 65: 187-207Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 9Feldman C. Munro N.C. Jeffery P.K. Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Boulnois G.J. Guerreiro D. Rhode J.A. Todd H.C. Cole P.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 5: 416-423Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because of this reason hyaluronate lyase is also being called “spreading factor.” The protein sequence of four bacterial hyaluronate lyase from S. pneumoniae (10Berry A.M. Lock R.A. Thomas S.M. Rajan D.P. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Streptococcus agalactiae (11Lin B. Hollingshead S.K. Coligan J.E. Egan M.L. Baker J.R. Pritchard D.

Microbiol. 1997; 43: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have been reported so far. Their sequence homologies range from 28 to 68% suggesting their structural, functional, and evolutionary similarities. The crystal structure of S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL) shows that the enzyme is built up of two domains, an N-terminal domain or catalytic domain, which is predominantly α-helical, and a C-terminal domain or the supportive domain, which is predominantly β-sheet (14Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The two domains are connected by a short linker polypeptide. The interface between the N- and C-terminal domains is composed of several residues from the two domains forming several interactions. The cleft in between the α- and β-domains is the place where the HA binding and degradation occurs and is wide at the two ends and narrower in the middle. The crystal structure of S. agalactiae hyaluronate lyase is similar to SpnHL in whole structure architecture and active site geometry except that it has an additional β-sheet domain before the N-terminal α-domain present in the SpnHL (15Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41407-41416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although crystal structure of hyaluronate lyase and S. agalactiae in complex with HA has been reported (14Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Li S. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), detailed insight into important structural features like existence of co-operative interactions between C- and N-terminal domains and the specific role of C-terminal domain in functional activity of SpnHL have not been provided so far. Besides this, despite the importance of SpnHL in pneumococcal infection no sincere efforts to search suitable inhibitors for this enzyme have been made (5Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We report detailed studies on the structural changes associated with the thermal denaturation and guanidine hydrochloride-, calcium chloride-, and magnesium chloride-induced unfolding of SpnHL using optical spectroscopic techniques, limited proteolysis, and enzymatic activity measurements. The N-terminal domain of SpnHL was isolated and purified after limited proteolysis. Comparative analysis of enzymatic activity and stability of the isolated N-terminal domain of SpnHL with that when present along with C-terminal in the native enzyme have also been reported. Furthermore, efficiency of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), l-arginine, l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), and guanidine isothiocyanate (GdnHSCN) as inhibitors of SpnHL has also been studied. Cloning of SpnHL—S. pneumoniae culture growth and the chromosomal DNA extraction were carried out as described previously (18Paton J.C. Berry A.M. Lock R. Hansman D. Manning P.A. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 50-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An internal gene fragment of SpnHL encoding functional hyaluronate lyase (19Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The different oligonucleotides (prepared based on the earlier reported gene sequence; GenBank™ accession number L20670) used were upstream, 5′-CTAGCTAGCGTTAAGGATACATACACAGACCGT and downstream, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTGCCTGCTCTAGTTTTTTAAAGAC for with C(6) histidine-tag and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATGCCTGCTCTAGTTTTTTAAAGAC for without histidine-tagged protein. Reactions were carried out in two phases for five and 30 cycles in a total volume of 50 μl with 2 units of Deep vent polymerase. The first five cycles for without overhang amplification was 94 °C, 30 s; 46.5 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 3 min; and the second 30 cycles for with overhang amplification was 94 °C, 30 s; 56.5 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 3 min with the final extension of 10 min. This amplified gene fragment was cloned into pET 21-d between NheI and XhoI sites. DNA sequencing confirmed the homogeneity of sequence. The resulting construct was transformed into BL21(DE3). Overexpression and Purification—Overexpression and purification for histidine-tagged protein was carried out as described earlier (18Paton J.C. Berry A.M. Lock R. Hansman D. Manning P.A. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 50-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of non histidine-tagged protein was carried out using various chromatographic techniques. Briefly, an overnight culture was harvested, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA. After sonication the cell lysate was loaded onto Mono-Q pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, and the protein was eluted with the linear gradient of buffer containing 100–500 mm NaCl. The fractions containing SpnHL was pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1.7 m. The protein solution was loaded onto phenyl-Sepharose (high substituted) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer containing 1.7 m ammonium sulfate. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 1.7 to 0 m ammonium sulfate. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and finally purified on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column on AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography equilibrated with the same buffer without ammonium sulfate. Eluted protein was finally concentrated, dialyzed against the 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and stored as a 10 mg/ml stock solution at 4 °C. The purity of purified enzyme was checked by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and found to be 99% pure. The final purified protein sample was also subjected to the N-terminal protein sequencing. Denaturation/Unfolding of SpnHL—SpnHL (1 μm) was incubated in the presence/absence of increasing concentration of GdnHCl or CaCl2 or MgCl2 and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C before taking the measurements. Initial studies were carried out with both the histidine-tagged and non-histidine-tagged enzyme. Similar results were obtained with both enzymes, so only histidine-tagged enzyme was used for further studies, as it was easy to purify. Assay of Enzymatic Activity—The activity of SpnHL is defined as its ability to breakdown HA to unsaturated disaccharide units (20Pritchard D.J. Lin B. Willingham T.R. Baker J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In a 1-ml solution of 0.2 mg/ml HA in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.0 (or the different salt concentration was maintained in the HA solution), 10 μl of enzyme sample (4 ng/μl, diluted just before taking measurement or stated otherwise) was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min during which the measurements were carried out by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 232 nm at 25 °C. Percent inhibition was determined as described previously (17Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectroluminesencemeter in a 5-mm path length quartz cell at 25 °C. For monitoring tryptophan fluorescence, excitation wavelength of 290 was used, and the spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. Circular Dichroism Measurements—CD measurements were made with a Jasco J800 spectropolarimeter calibrated with ammonium (+)- 10-camphorsulfonate. The results are expressed as the mean residual ellipticity [θ], which is defined as [θ] = 100 × θobs/(lc), where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees, c is the concentration in moles of residue per liter, and l is the length of the light path in centimeters. The values obtained were normalized by subtracting the base line recorded for the buffer having the same concentration of denaturant or salt under similar conditions. Limited Proteolysis—SpnHL (0.2 mg/ml) incubated for 1 h under specified conditions was subjected to limited proteolysis with carboxypeptidase B under similar conditions like at 55 °C or in the presence of 0.75 m GdnHCl or 1.5 m CaCl2 at 25 °C for 15 min. A protease to enzyme ratio of 1:100 (w/w) was used for the study. The protease reaction was stopped by adding 2 mm EDTA to reaction mixture, and the samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration experiments were carried out on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column and Sephadex 75 HR 10/30 column on AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) for the purification of native SpnHL and the N-terminal domain, respectively. Column was calibrated with various molecular weight standard markers (Amersham Biosciences) before use. Column was equilibrated and run with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. 200 μl of the sample was loaded on the column and run at 25 °C, flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, with detection at 280 nm. The crystal structure of SpnHL shows that the enzyme is made of two distinct structural domains connected by a short polypeptide linker. Both the domains are spherical and of approximately the same size of about 41 kDa (14Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The N-terminal α-helical domain (α-domain) contains the first 361 residues (Lys171–Ser531) of the enzyme and is composed of 13 α-helices connected by 12 loops. An 11-residue linker (Asp532–Ser542) is located between the two structural domains. The C-terminal β-sheet domain (β-domain) contains the following 347 residues (Tyr543–Lys889) and is composed of 24 β-strands, four short α-helices, and 25 connecting loops. The interface between the N- and C-terminal domains is 1776 Å2 in area and is composed of 37 residues from the N-terminal domain and 34 residues from the C-terminal domain forming about 343 interactions. For analyzing the cooperative interactions existing between the two structural domains of SpnHL we first studied the relative stability of the N- and C-terminal domains by carrying out thermal- and GdnHCl-induced denaturation of enzyme. Thermal Denaturation—The thermal unfolding of SpnHL was characterized by monitoring the loss of secondary structure of enzyme with temperature. Fig. 1 summarizes the changes in ellipticity at 222 nm of SpnHL at increasing temperature, where two distinct transitions were observed between 20 and 100 °C. These transitions were in the temperature regions from 35 to 60 °C and 65 to 100 °C and centered at about 50 and 82 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the transitions were found to be reversible as they were also observed on cooling the SpnHL samples from 100 to 20 °C after the heating scan (data not shown). These observations suggest that the SpnHL molecule contains two distinct structural domains of significantly different thermal stabilities. Guanidine Hydrochloride Unfolding—The guanidine hydrochloride-induced changes in the structural properties of SpnHL were studied using optical spectroscopic techniques. Time-dependent changes in structural parameters of SpnHL at increasing concentrations of GdnHCl showed maximum changes within1hof incubation and no further alteration up to the next 12 h (data not shown) suggesting that incubation time of 1 h is sufficient for achieving equilibrium under any GdnHCl concentration studied. The GdnHCl-induced alterations in the tertiary structure of SpnHL were monitored by studying the changes in the tryptophan fluorescence of enzyme at increasing concentration of GdnHCl. If a significant difference exists between the fluorescence emission maxima of native and denatured protein, corelation between the GdnHCl concentration and the functional changes in wavelength at which fluorescence emission is maximal provides useful information on the stabilization of intermediates during protein unfolding (21Praksh K. Prajapati S. Ahmad A. Jain S.K. Bhakuni V. Prot. Sci. 2002; 11: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For SpnHL, the emission wavelength maximum in the absence of GdnHCl (f o) and at GdnHCl concentration greater than 2.5 m (f d) were 334 and 355 nm, respectively. The fractional change in wavelength at which the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum of SpnHL is maximal is plotted against the concentration of GdnHCl in Fig. 2A. Two well separated transitions were observed on increasing the GdnHCl concentration between 0 and 2.5 m. The first transition was very sharp and occurred between 0.4 and 0.7 m GdnHCl. A plateau region existed between 0.7 and 0.9 m and was followed by a broad second transition between 0.9 and 2 m GdnHCl. Furthermore, the changes in emission wavelength associated with the first transition was only from 334 to 341 nm, suggesting that only partial unfolding of the SpnHL molecule is associated with the first transition. At 2 m GdnHCl, an emission wavelength of 355 nm was observed indicating that all the tryptophan moieties present in the SpnHL are exposed to solvent under these conditions (22Akhtar M.S. Ahmad A. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry,. 2002; 41: 7142-7149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Such a situation can arise only when the protein is completely unfolded. The effect of GdnHCl on the secondary structure of SpnHL was studied by monitoring changes in the far-UV CD profiles of the enzyme. In the far-UV region, the CD spectrum of native SpnHL shows the presence of substantial α-helical and β-sheet conformation. Fig. 2B summarizes the effect of increasing GdnHCl concentration on loss of ellipticity at 222 nm for SpnHL. Two well separated transitions, a sharp transition between 0.4 and 0.75 m GdnHCl, and a broad transition between 0.9 and 2.2 m GdnHCl were observed. Furthermore, only about 30% loss of secondary structure was found to be associated with the first transition indicating only partial unfolding of SpnHL molecules under these conditions. However, at GdnHCl concentrations greater than 2 m, a complete loss of far-UV CD signal was observed suggesting complete unfolding of SpnHL molecules at higher GdnHCl concentrations. As only partial unfolding of SpnHL molecules was found to be associated with the first transition observed at low GdnHCl concentrations, it seems that probably only one of the structural domains of enzyme unfolds under these conditions whereas the other domain remains intact. The thermal denaturation profile of 0.75 m GdnHCl-treated SpnHL further strengthened this possibility as only a single transition with mid-point of thermal transition (T m) of about 40 °C was observed for this sample (Fig. 2C). Calcium ions are essential for the normal enzymatic activity of SpnHL (18Paton J.C. Berry A.M. Lock R. Hansman D. Manning P.A. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 50-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pritchard D.J. Trent J.O. Zhang P. Egan M.L. Baker J.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the calcium ions most likely bind to the C-terminal domain of SpnHL and induce structural changes in the loop of the catalytic cleft (24Fethiere J. Eggimann B. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of CaCl2 and MgCl2 on the domain structure of SpnHL. The CaCl2- and MgCl2-induced alterations in the tertiary structure of SpnHL were studied by monitoring the changes in the tryptophan fluorescence of enzyme. Fig. 3A summarizes the changes in the emission wavelength of tryptophan fluorescence of SpnHL at increasing concentrations of CaCl2 and MgCl2. A sigmoidal dependence of enhancement of emission wavelength (from 334 to 341 nm) with increasing concentration of CaCl2 or MgCl2 was observed. However, even at 1.5 m CaCl2 or MgCl2 an emission wavelength of about 341 nm was observed suggesting only partial unfolding of enzyme under these conditions (as discussed under “GdnHCl Denaturation”). The far-UV CD studies on SpnHL with increasing concentrations of CaCl2 or MgCl2 also support the suggestion of partial unfolding of enzyme by these salts. Fig. 3B shows the loss of CD ellipticity at 222 nm of SpnHL with increasing concentration of CaCl2 or MgCl2. A maximum of only about 30% loss of secondary structure was observed for CaCl2- or MgCl2-induced transition. As CaCl2 or MgCl2 induces only partial unfolding of SpnHL molecules it seems that these salts probably induce unfolding of only one of the structural domains of enzyme whereas the other domain remains intact. As GdnHCl (at low concentration), CaCl2, or MgCl2, which are all electrolytes, induced partial unfolding of SpnHL, the possibility of a nonspecific ion-induced effect on the enzyme was also explored. For this, the effect of NaCl on structural parameters of SpnHL was studied and is summarized in Fig. 2, A and B. NaCl even up to 2 m concentration showed no significant change in the tryptophan fluorescence or to the secondary structure of SpnHL indicating that NaCl does not induce any change in enzyme structure probably because of lack of its interaction with the enzyme. These observations collectively suggest that GdnHCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 have specific interaction/binding sites with/in SpnHL. The factors determining the vulnerability for proteolysis of a protein by protease depend on the conformational parameters such as accessibility, segmental motion, and protrusions. For this reason limited proteolysis has been effectively used to monitor structural domains in proteins, ligand-induced conformational changes, and protein folding/unfolding (25Hubbard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To characterize the structural domains corresponding to the transitions observed during thermal-, GdnHCl-, and CaCl2-induced unfolding of SpnHL (see Figs. 1,2,3) limited proteolysis studies were carried out under conditions where only one transition was complete. Fig. 4A summarizes the SDS-PAGE profile of the protein fragments obtained on limited proteolysis with carboxypeptidase B of the SpnHL molecule heated at 55 °C or treated with 0.75 m GdnHCl or 1.5 m CaCl2. For all three samples, a single protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of about 40 kDa was observed on proteolysis. There are about 96 cleavage sites of Carboxypeptidase B spread throughout the SpnHL molecule, including one in the linker region. However, limited proteolysis of SpnHL by the protease in all the conditions studied resulted in only a single fragment of about 40 kDa. This suggests that the obtained fragment is a folded one in which the proteolytic sites are buried in the protein interior and not accessible to protease for cleavage. The N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the 40-kDa fragments were carried out following Western blotting of protein bands on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. In all the three cases the nine amino acids obtained corresponded to the first nine residues (ASVKDTYTD) of the N-terminal domain of SpnHL. These observations suggest that heating of the SpnHL molecule to 55 °C or treating it with 0.75 m GdnHCl or 1.5 m CaCl2 results in unfolding of only the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain of SpnHL obtained on limited proteolysis was purified by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4B). For characterization of the carboxypeptidase B cleavage site in SpnHL that generates the N-terminal fragment on proteolysis, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the N-terminal fragments obtained were carried out. Only two peaks corresponding to molecular massed of 40501 and 42414.5 Da with relative intensity ratios of 3:1, respectively, were observed (data not shown). As the major peak corresponded to a molecular mass of 40501 Da, it suggests that the carboxypeptidase B cleavage site in the SpnHL is between Tyr520 and Lys521. This site is located at the end of N-terminal domain just before the polypeptide linkers analyzed from the crystal structure. The size exclusion chromatographically purified N-terminal domains of SpnHL (Fig. 4B) were analyzed for thermal stability, GdnHCl denaturation, and enzymatic activity. Thermal Stability—The thermal denaturation profiles of the isolated N-terminal fragments were obtained by monitoring loss of CD ellipticity at 222 nm with increasing temperature. Fig. 5 summarize the T m observed for the isolated N-terminal domain obtained on limited proteolysis of SpnHL at 55 °C and on treatment with 0.75 m GdnHCl. A single transition with the T m of about 76 and 75 °C was observed for the two samples, which is very close to the T m of 82 °C (Fig. 1) observed for N-terminal domain in the native enzyme. This observation demonstrates that the fragments obtained on proteolysis of SpnHL (Fig. 4B) are intact N-terminal domains. Furthermore, it also demonstrates that the stability of N-terminal domain was not affected by removal of C-terminal domain suggesting the absence of cooperative interactions between the two domains of SpnHL. GdnHCl Denaturation—The GdnHCl denaturation profile of the purified N-terminal domain obtained on limited proteolysis of SpnHL at 55 °C and on treatment with 0.75 m GdnHCl was studied using tryptophan fluorescence and far-UV CD spectroscopies and is summarized in Fig. 6. The alterations in the tertiary structure of N-terminal fragment of SpnHL were monitored by studying the changes in the tryptophan fluorescence at increasing concentration of GdnHCl. When fractional change in emission wavelength at which the fluorescence intensity of N-terminal fragment of SpnHL is maximal is plotted against the increasing concentration of GdnHCl, a sigmoidal transition in the GdnHCl concentration range between 0.5 and 2 m was observed (Fig. 6A). A C m (denaturant concentration where 50% denaturation of protein is observed) of about 1.25 m GdnHCl was found to be associated with this transition. The effect of GdnHCl on the secondary structure of N-terminal fragment of SpnHL was studied by monitoring changes in the far-UV CD profiles of the enzyme. The CD spectrum of N-terminal fragment of SpnHL in the far-UV region shows the presence of substantial α-helical conformation. Fig. 6B summarizes the effect of increasing GdnHCl concentration on the loss of ellipticity at 222 nm for N-terminal fragment of SpnHL. A single transition in the GdnHCl concentration range between 0.5 and 2 m was observed. A C m of about 1.25 m GdnHCl was found to be associated with this transition. As for both tryptophan fluorescence and far-UV CD, a single transition between 0.5 and 2 m GdnHCl was observed, which suggests that the N-terminal fragment of SpnHL undergoes a cooperative unfolding with simultaneous loss of both the secondary and the tertiary structure. The thermal denaturation profile of N-terminal fragment of SpnHL obtained as described above, treated with 0.75 m GdnHCl, was studied. A single transition with a T m of about 40 °C (Fig. 6C) was observed, which is similar to that observed for the 0.75 m GdnHCl-treated SpnHL (Fig. 2C). In native SpnHL, for the second transition observed at higher concentrations of GdnHCl, a C m of about 1.25 m was observed by both tryptophan fluorescence and far-UV CD (Fig. 2, A and B), which is similar to that reported above for the purified N-terminal fragment of SpnHL. These observations lend further support to the contention that the N-terminal fragments obtained on limited proteolysis of SpnHL treated under specified conditions is in folded conformation. The reported structure of SpnHL in complex with hyaluronic acid (16Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that the three residues, Tyr408, His399, and Asn349, from N-terminal domain and HA are perfectly placed to support the mechanism of HA degradation (14Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This indicates that probably the C-terminal domain does not play any significant role in the enzymatic activity of SpnHL. This possibility is further supported by the evidence from some structurally related enzyme like glucoamylase (26Sevcik J. Hostinova E. Gasperik J. Solovicova A. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 854-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and alginate lyase (27Yoon H.J. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in which only the α-domain is present. As we were able to obtain an intact N-terminal domain of SpnHL we carried out enzymatic activity measurements of this domain. Fig. 7 summarizes the comparison of enzymatic activity of isolated N-terminal domain with that of the native enzyme. The N-terminal domain showed about 12% enzymatic activities compared with the native enzyme. This demonstrates that the N-terminal domain is the functional domain of SpnHL and is itself sufficient for carrying out the enzymatic reaction. The C-terminal domain seems to modulate the enzymatic activity probably by holding the substrate, hyaluronic acid, in a suitable conformation for enzymatic reaction as speculated earlier (14Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The degradation of hyaluronan in the connective tissues by SpnHL is an important step in the pneumococcal invasion. The bacterial strains producing more hyaluronate lyase are more virulent than those strains producing less enzyme (28Rollend K. Marois C. Siqyier V. Cattier B. Quentin R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 1892-1898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, S. pneumoniae strains with SpnHL and cell toxin pneumolysin double mutations showed significant additive attenuation in virulence (29Berry A.M. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of SpnHL is expected to reduce the spreading of S. pneumoniae pathogen in the early stages of the pneumococcal invasion. Furthermore, hyaluronate lyase from bacteria and Streptomyces differ from hyaluronidases from other sources, including mammals, by their mode of action. They catalyze an elimination reaction, rather than hydrolysis of the β1,4-glycosidic linkage between N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine and d-glucuronic acid residues in hyaluronan. Because of these reasons SpnHL becomes a potential target for developing antimicrobial agents. Salicylate, vitamin C, heparin, dicumarene, and flavonoids have been reported to have certain inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity of hyaluronidase (5Menzel E.J. Farr C. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, recent studies by Li et al. (17Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have reported that of the above mentioned molecules only vitamin C inhibits SpnHL activity. They also reported the crystal structure of SpnHL·vitamin C complex (17Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which shows that only one vitamin C molecule binds to SpnHL at the active site and forms about 25 interactions with seven residues (mainly from N-terminal domain and only one from C-terminal domain) of SpnHL. The structural studies on SpnHL presented in this paper demonstrated that GdnHCl interacts with enzyme and induces significant structural changes in it. As the active site of an enzyme is very susceptible to subtle adjustments or conformational variations in the enzyme we thought it worthwhile to study the effect of GdnHCl and some related molecules (having guanidino moiety) on the enzyme activity of SpnHL so that their efficiency as inhibitors can be explored. Fig. 8 summarizes the effect of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl, l-arginine, l-NAME, and GdnHSCN on the inhibition of enzymatic activity of SpnHL. All four molecules inhibited the SpnHL activity in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 of enzyme activity by GdnHCl, l-arginine, l-NAME, and GdnHSCN was found to be 150, 8.0, 0.85, and 0.14 mm, respectively. The interesting observation is that at the concentration of GdnHCl at which there is complete inhibition of SpnHL activity (about 350 mm), no significant effect on structural properties of enzyme was observed (Fig. 2). Similar observations were obtained for GdnHSCN, l-NAME, and l-arginine (data not shown). These observations suggest that GdnHCl or l-arginine or l-NAME and GdnHSCN affect the active site of enzyme at a concentration much lower than that required for bringing out any significant structural change in enzyme. This is possible only if these molecules bind directly to the active site first, followed by binding to other sites in the enzyme, which results in structural changes. For vitamin C, which has been reported as an inhibitor of SpnHL, an IC50 of ∼5.8 mm was observed (17Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study an IC50 of ∼0.85 and 0.14 mm were observed for l-NAME and GdnHSCN, respectively, which are significantly lower (about seven and 40 times) than vitamin C. These studies present a new chemical entity that can be exploited for better designing of inhibitors for SpnHL. Dr. A. Ayyagari, Department of Microbiology, Sanjay Gandhi Institute for Post Graduate Studies, Lucknow, India is thanked for providing the S. pneumoniae culture. Dr. C. M. Gupta is thanked for constant support provided during the studies. Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi, is thanked for financial assistance (to M. S. A.)."

Amino-terminal protein sequence analysis of the α1(IX)COL3 domain purified from bovine nucleus pulposus gave a different sequence to that of the long α1(IX) transcript expressed in hyaline cartilage and matched the predicted sequence of short α1(IX). The findings indicate that the matrix of bovine nucleus pulposus contains only the short form of α1(IX) that lacks the NC4 domain. The sequence encoded by exon 7, predicted from human COL9A1, is absent from both short and long forms of α1(IX) from bovine nucleus pulposus and articular cartilage. A structural analysis of the cross-linking sites occupied in type IX collagen from nucleus pulposus showed that usage of the short α1(IX) transcript in disc tissue had no apparent effect on cross-linking behavior. As in cartilage, type IX collagen of nucleus pulposus was heavily cross-linked to type II collagen and to other molecules of type IX collagen with a similar site occupancy. Nucleus pulposus, the central zone of the intervertebral disc, is gel-like and has a similar collagen phenotype to that of hyaline cartilage.

As in cartilage, type IX collagen of nucleus pulposus was heavily cross-linked to type II collagen and to other molecules of type IX collagen with a similar site occupancy. The collagen phenotype of hyaline cartilage is complex; at least seven distinct collagen types have been identified, of which types II, XI, and IX are the cartilage-specific molecules. In addition, significant amounts of collagen types III, VI, XII, and XIV have been identified in cartilage matrix (1Eyre D. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 30-35Google Scholar, 2Ayad S. Marriott A. Morgan K.

Type IX collagen is a structural matrix component that is most abundant in hyaline cartilages of the developing skeleton. It functions as an adhesion protein in the extracellular matrix where it becomes covalently cross-linked to the surface of type II collagen fibrils and most concentrated on thin fibrils of the pericellular domain (4Mendler M.

The molecule is a heterotrimer of genetically distinct α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX) chains, which form three triple-helical segments, COL1, 1The abbreviations used are: COL, collagenous; NC, non-collagenous; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; N- and C-telopeptides, short sequences that lack the (Gly-XY)n repeat and from the amino and carboxyl ends of various collagen chains. COL2, and COL3 and four non-helical domains, NC1–NC4. The largest, NC4 on α1(IX), is basically charged, suggesting that it may serve to interact with proteoglycans (7Vasios G. Nishimura I. Konomi H. van der Rest M. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2324-2329Google Scholar). Recent reports have linked genetic polymorphisms to risk of disc degeneration (8Annunen S. Paassilta P. Lohiniva J. Perala M. Pihlajamaa T. Karppinen J. Tervonen O. Kroger H. Lahde S. Vanharanta H. Ryhanen L. Goring H.H.H. Ott J. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L.

Med. Assoc. 2001; 285: 1843-1849Google Scholar). Specifically, tryptophan substitutions at position 326 of the α2(IX) chain, and position 103 of the α3(IX) chain, were associated with increased risk of human lumbar disc degeneration and chronic sciatica but not knee osteoarthritis (8Annunen S. Paassilta P. Lohiniva J. Perala M. Pihlajamaa T. Karppinen J. Tervonen O. Kroger H. Lahde S. Vanharanta H. Ryhanen L. Goring H.H.H. Ott J. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L.

Med. Assoc. 2001; 285: 1843-1849Google Scholar). Nucleus pulposus, the gel-like central zone of the young intervertebral disc, has a similar collagen phenotype to that of hyaline cartilage, with types II, IX, and XI collagens being the principal fibrillar components (10Eyre D.R. Matsui Y. Wu J.-J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 844-848Google Scholar). The association of the tryptophan polymorphisms with clinical conditions involving discs but not synovial joint cartilages implies that the molecular character of collagen IX in intervertebral disc collagen may differ from that in hyaline cartilage. The properties of collagen IX from disc tissue have not been fully characterized. The human α1(IX) gene gives rise to two mRNA transcripts, a long and a short form (11Muragaki Y. Kimura T. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 703-708Google Scholar). The long form is expressed in hyaline cartilages and the product has a globular NH2-terminal domain, NC4. Short α1(IX), expressed in embryonic chick cornea (12Nishimura I. Muragaki Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20033-20041Google Scholar), is transcribed from an alternative start site and lacks the NC4 domain. A second promoter and an alternative exon 1, located in the intron between exons 6 and 7 of COL9A1, are used to express the short form of α1(IX). In the present study, by NH2-terminal sequence analysis of COL3(IX) domains isolated from the matrix of bovine nucleus pulposes and articular cartilage, we show that nucleus pulposus contains exclusively the short form of α1(IX). The covalent cross-linking properties of nucleus pulposus type IX collagen were also characterized to determine any consequences of having short instead of long α1(IX). Preparation of Type IX Collagen—Articular cartilage was dissected from knee joints and nucleus pulposus from lumbar spines of 3-month-old calves. Tissue slices were extracted in 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 24 h to remove proteoglycans and other matrix proteins then washed thoroughly with water and freeze-dried. Cross-linked collagens were solubilized by digesting the washed residues with pepsin at 4 °C. Pepsin digests were fractionated into collagen types II, XI, and IX (COL1 and COL2 trimers) by precipitation at 0.7, 1.2, and 2.0 m NaCl, respectively (13Wu J.-J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 1033-1039Google Scholar). The COL3 domains of type IX collagen were then isolated from the 4.0 m NaCl precipitated fraction. Column Chromatography—Pepsin-solubilized type IX collagen COL1 and COL2 trimers were resolved on a C8 reverse-phase column (Brownlee Aquapore RP-300; 4.6 mm × 25 cm) with a linear gradient (23–38%) of solvent B in A over 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min collecting 1-ml fractions. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in water, and solvent B was 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile:n-propyl alcohol (3:1, v/v). Eluent was monitored for 220 nm absorbance, and aliquots of collected fractions (100 μl each) were dried and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The disulfide-bounded COL2 trimer was reduced, and cysteines were carboxymethylated with iodoacetate before rechromatographing the individual chains on the same column with a linear gradient (15–40%) of solvent B in A over 50 min. The COL3 domains of type IX collagen were isolated from the 4.0 m NaCl precipitated fraction by molecular sieve chromatography on a Bio-Gel A5m column (1.5 × 170 cm, 200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) eluted with a 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 m guanidine HCl, at a flow rate of 4 ml/h, collecting 2.0-ml fractions. Aliquots of collected fractions were desalted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the type IX collagen COL3 domain were pooled. The individual COL3(IX) chains were then resolved by HPLC on a C8 reverse-phase column with a linear gradient (15–40%) of solvent B in A over 50 min followed by SDS-PAGE. Gel Electrophoresis and Electroblotting of Proteins—Collagen fractions recovered by differential salt precipitation and column chromatography were routinely examined by SDS-PAGE (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). For amino-terminal sequence analysis and Western blotting, resolved protein bands were transblotted to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) using a MilliBlot-SDE electroblotting apparatus (Millipore). The membrane was washed thoroughly in ultrapure water (Millipore Milli-Q) to remove salts, then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to detect protein bands. Bands were excised for automated sequence analysis (5Wu J.-J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Google Scholar). For Western blotting, a monoclonal antibody, 10F2, one of several raised against protease-generated neoepitopes in the collagen α1(II)C-telopeptide (15Atley L. Shao P. Ochs V. Shaffer K. Eyre D.R. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23: 850Google Scholar), was used as the primary, and biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary, antibody then followed by ExtrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). The blots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Protein Sequencing—Amino-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a Porton 2090E gas-phase microsequencer equipped with on-line high performance liquid chromatography analysis of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. To remove pyroglutamate from the NH2-terminal end of blocked collagen chains, protein was solubilized in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, 0.01 m EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0, and treated with the enzyme pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 5 h before SDS-PAGE and transblotting (16Wu J.-J. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18865-18870Google Scholar). The 2.0 m NaCl-precipitated fraction of the pepsin digest of bovine nucleus pulposus was enriched in the triple-helical COL1 and COL2 domains of type IX collagen. The 4.0 m NaCl-precipitated fraction contained the COL3 domain (Fig. 1a), which was further purified by molecular sieve chromatography on a Bio-Gel A5m column (Fig. 1b). After identification by SDS-PAGE, fractions combining the individual COL3 domains (bar in Fig. 1b) were pooled and the chains resolved by reverse-phase HPLC on a C8 column. Fig. 2 shows the HPLC profile and SDS-PAGE resolution of the individual COL3(IX) chains. The protein bands were transblotted to PVDF membrane, and their identities established by amino-terminal sequence analysis. Fig. 2 shows the determined NH2-terminal sequences of the three gene products after treatment with pyroglutamine aminopeptidase to remove blocking pyroglutamate residues. Without pyroglutamine aminopeptidase treatment, all three component chains were NH2-terminally blocked.Fig. 2Reverse-phase HPLC of type IX collagen COL3 domain from nucleus pulposus. Fractions marked by the bar in Fig. 1b were concentrated and eluted from a C8 reverse-phase column (Brownlee Aquapore RP-300; 4.6 mm × 25 cm) with a linear gradient (15–40%) of solvent B in A over 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min collecting 1-ml fractions. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in water, and solvent B was 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile: n-propyl alcohol (3:1, v/v). Aliquots of collected fractions (100 μl each) were analyzed by SDS-12.5% PAGE (inset). Also shown are amino-terminal sequences from the transblotted bands. Sequences were determined after removing the blocking pyroglutamate residue (Gln (Q)) with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase. P*, 4-hydroxyproline.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the α1(IX) NH2-terminal sequence derived from bovine nucleus pulposus was compared with the cDNA-predicted human sequence, nucleus pulposus α1(IX) was identical to the predicted short-form of human α1(IX) beginning with an NH2-terminal glutamate encoded by alternative exon 1 and continuing with the sequence encoded by exon 8 (Fig. 3a). This result establishes that bovine nucleus pulposus contains the short form of α1(IX) that lacks the NC4 protein domain. In contrast, NH2-terminal sequence analysis of pepsin-derived α1(IX)COL3 from calf articular cartilage showed that the amino terminus was not blocked and the sequence was identical to that of the long form of α1(IX) predicted from the human cDNA corresponding to the COOH-terminal portion of the NC4 domain (Fig. 3b). The results, however, show that the 7-amino acid sequence encoded by a predicted exon 7 is missing. The present findings, therefore, suggest a bovine splicing variant (or genomic difference) that results in the long α1(IX) form of bovine hyaline cartilage lacking the exon 7 sequence of the NC4 domain. Previous studies have shown that all four triple-helical cross-linking sites of type IX collagen are located in the COL2 domain (5Wu J.-J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Google Scholar, 17Diab M. Wu J.-J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Google Scholar). To determine whether the apparent exclusive usage of the short form of α1(IX) in the nucleus pulposus affects the cross-linking properties of type IX collagen, the 2 m NaCl-precipitated fraction of a pepsin digest of bovine nucleus pulposus was run on a C8 reverse-phase column to separate the COL2(IX) trimer from the COL1(IX) trimer (Fig. 4). Individual COL2(IX) chains were resolved from each other by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 5a) and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5b) after reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues. Direct NH2-terminal sequence analysis of each protein band was performed after electroblotting to a PVDF membrane. Fig. 5d shows the sequences identified. Each type IX band gave multiple running sequences, one of which was the NH2 terminus of the NC3/COL2 domain. The others were the N- and C-telopeptides of type II collagen and α3(IX) NC1. All the results were consistent with previous findings on cartilage type IX collagen (5Wu J.-J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Google Scholar, 17Diab M. Wu J.-J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Google Scholar), with an N-telopeptide cross-linked to all three type IX chains at a COL2 site, α3(IX) NC1 linked to α1(IX) and α3(IX) at this same COL2 site and a C-telopeptide of type II collagen linked to a second α3(IX)COL2 site.Fig. 5Reverse-phase HPLC fractionation of individual collagen IX COL2 chains.

The results of analysis of the COL3 domain of type IX collagen from nucleus pulposus establish that only the short form of α1(IX) (expressed by use of alternative exon 1) is used in the matrix. Several other collagen genes have been reported to use alternative promoters and produce alternative transcripts in a tissue-specific manner. For example, with human α2(VI) and mouse α1(XVIII) genes, the translated products of two different promoters vary in the length of their NH2-terminal non-collagenous domain (18Saitta B. Chu M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 675-682Google Scholar, 19Rehn M. Hintikka E. Pihlajaniemi T. Genomics. 1996; 32: 436-446Google Scholar). From chick α2(I) and α1(III) genes, the alternative transcripts create different reading frames that do not encode collagenous proteins (20Pallante K.M. Niu Z. Zhao Y. Cohen A.J. Nah H.D. Adams S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25233-25239Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Niu Z. Cohen A.J. Nah H.D. Adams S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2470-2477Google Scholar, 22Cohen A.J. Lakshmi T.R. Niu Z. Trindade J. Billings P.C. Adams S.L. Mech. Dev. 2002; 114: 177-180Google Scholar). The short transcriptional form of α1(IX) has been identified in the developing chick cornea, vitreous humor, and notochord and in mouse eye and heart during embryonic development (12Nishimura I. Muragaki Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20033-20041Google Scholar, 23Yada T. Suzuki S. Kobayashi K. Kobayashi M. Hoshino T. Horie K. Kimata K. J. Biol.

In the young disc, nucleus pulposus is known to contain both chondrocytic and notochordal cells (29Oegema Jr., T.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 839-844Google Scholar). During growth, the notochordal cells die while chondrocytic cells persist. Since only one transcription product, the short form of α1(IX), was detected in the young bovine nucleus pulposus, this suggests that either the chondrocytic cells of the nucleus differ from those of hyaline cartilage in their promoter usage of Col9a1 or, perhaps, that the notochordal cells produce the collagen IX. It is notable in this regard that in animals in which the nucleus pulposus retains a gelatinous, youthful texture throughout life (e.g. non-chondrodystrophoid breeds of dog), notochordal cells also persist (29Oegema Jr., T.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 839-844Google Scholar). The short form of the type IX collagen molecule in chick vitreous also bears a long glycosaminoglycan chain on the NC3 domain of the α2(IX) chain (23Yada T. Suzuki S. Kobayashi K. Kobayashi M. Hoshino T. Horie K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6992-6999Google Scholar). The functional significance of the long glycosaminoglycan chain is still uncertain, although it has been proposed that it might prevent lateral fibril aggregation in the gel-like vitreous. Collagen fibrils in the vitreous are particularly thin and widely dispersed from each other compared with cartilage (30Bos K.J. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. McLeod D. Morris N.P. Bishop P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1011-1022Google Scholar), in which in the mammal, the α2(IX) chain lacks the glycosaminoglycan chain (17Diab M. Wu J.-J. Eyre D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 327-332Google Scholar). Thin fibrils, and a gelatinous texture, are also features of the young nucleus pulposus. It is not known whether the α2(IX) chain of nucleus pulposus has a glycosaminoglycan chain attached to its NC3 domain. The present findings do show that despite lacking an NC4 domain on the α1(IX) chain, the cross-linking properties of nucleus pulposus type IX collagen are essentially the same as in cartilage. As in cartilage, the disc-type IX molecules are cross-linked to type II collagen and to other type IX collagen molecules, so that a recently proposed model of the molecular interactions (31Eyre D.R. Wu J.-J. Fernandes R.J. Pietka T.A. Weis M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 894-899Google Scholar), which accommodates all known cross-linking sites, is applicable to disc and cartilage. The results also show that the 7-amino acid sequence encoded by human exon 7 is absent from bovine α1(IX). It has been established for chick cartilage that the equivalent exon 7 sequence is present in the cDNA from the long mRNA transcript of Col9a1 and by sequence analysis of tryptic peptides that the protein sequence is expressed in tissue α1(IX) (7Vasios G. Nishimura I. Konomi H. van der Rest M. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2324-2329Google Scholar). The present findings, therefore, indicate either a gene sequence difference in bovine Col9a1 or a spliced-out version of α1(IX) lacking the exon 7 sequence in our bovine cartilage samples. No evidence emerged for an α1(IX) chain that included the exon 7 domain, so it is not known whether the alternative version can be expressed in any tissue in this species. Bovine genomic sequence is not available to help resolve this issue. The α1(IX) chain NC4 domain is encoded by exons 2–7. It is not known whether any exons other than 7 can be variably spliced. Transcripts of the other cartilage-specific collagens, types II and XI, are known to be variably spliced (32Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Google Scholar, 33Oxford J.T.

Dev. Dyn. 2001; 220: 350-362Google Scholar). Tryptophan substitutions at position 326 of the α2(IX) chain, and position 103 of the α3(IX) chain, have been linked to increased risk of human lumbar disc degeneration and chronic sciatica (8Annunen S. Paassilta P. Lohiniva J. Perala M. Pihlajamaa T. Karppinen J. Tervonen O. Kroger H. Lahde S. Vanharanta H. Ryhanen L. Goring H.H.H. Ott J. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L.

Med. Assoc. 2001; 285: 1843-1849Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the tryptophan residue in the α2(IX)COL2 domain near the known cross-linking site at residue 330 in α3(IX)COL2 might interfere with the interaction between collagens II and IX (8Annunen S. Paassilta P. Lohiniva J. Perala M. Pihlajamaa T. Karppinen J. Tervonen O. Kroger H. Lahde S. Vanharanta H. Ryhanen L. Goring H.H.H. Ott J. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L. Science. 1999; 285: 409-412Google Scholar). This site cross-links the C-telopeptide of type II collagen to α3(IX)COL2. Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody 10F2, which is specific to the C-telopeptide of type II collagen, confirms that the type II collagen C-telopeptide is attached selectively to α3(IX)COL2 (Fig. 5c). Antibody 10F2 recognizes a cleavage site in the type II C-telopeptide generated by pepsin. 2J.-J. Wu and D. R. Eyre, unpublished observations. The yields on NH2-terminal sequence analysis also indicate that essentially every molecule has an attached C-telopeptide. Future work with this antibody might, therefore, provide a sensitive method for detecting any changes in cross-linking between α3(IX)COL2 and type II collagen C-telopeptide caused by the tryptophan-containing polymorphic variants (38Matsui Y. Wu J.-J. Weis M.A. Pietka T. Eyre D.R. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 123-129Google Scholar). Peptide mapping using a multi-epitope recognizing antiserum to type IX collagen has proved to be useful for displaying the cross-linking properties in general of type IX collagen in fetal human cartilage (36Ichimura S. Wu J.-J. Eyre D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 33-39Google Scholar, 37Bönnemann C.G. Cox G.F. Shapiro F. Wu J.-J. Feener C.A. Thompson T.G. Anthony D.C. Eyre D.R. Darras B.T. Kunkel L.M.

In conclusion, we have found that nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc contains the short form of the α1(IX) chain, a product of an alternative promoter, which lacks the NC4 domain. The cross-linking properties of nucleus pulposus type IX collagen are, however, similar to those of hyaline cartilage. We also have identified in bovine cartilage a previously undescribed splicing variant of the long form of α1(IX) that lacks the sequence encoded by exon 7. Its pattern of expression (in development, tissue type, species, etc.), and any functional significance remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2095677309,"Hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1)/p32/gC1qR was characterized as a highly acidic and oligomeric protein, which binds to different ligands like hyaluronan, C1q, and mannosylated albumin. It exists as trimer in high ionic and reducing conditions as shown by crystal structure. In the present study, we have examined the structural changes of HABP1 under a wide range of ionic environments. HABP1 exhibits structural plasticity, which is influenced by the ionic environment under in vitro conditions near physiological pH. At low ionic strength HABP1 exists in a highly expanded and loosely held trimeric structure, similar to that of the molten globule-like state, whereas the presence of salt stabilizes the trimeric structure in a more compact fashion. It is likely that the combination of the high net charge asymmetrically distributed along the faces of the molecule and the relatively low intrinsic hydrophobicity of HABP1 result in its expanded structure at neutral pH. Thus, the addition of counter ions in the molecular environment minimizes the intramolecular electrostatic repulsion in HABP1 leading to its stable and compact conformations, which reflect in its differential binding toward different ligands. Whereas the binding of HABP1 toward HA is enhanced on increasing the ionic strength, no significant effect was observed with the two other ligands, C1q and mannosylated albumin. Thus, although HA interacts only with compact HABP1, C1q and mannosylated albumin can bind to loosely held oligomeric HABP1 as well. In other words, structural changes in HABP1 mediated by changes in the ionic environment are responsible for recognizing different ligands.

The ubiquitous glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan is an unbranched polysaccharide composed entirely of a repeating disaccharide, d-glucuronic acid (β1→3) N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (β1→4), which, unlike other glycosaminoglycans, is neither attached to a protein core nor O- or N-sulfated. It has diverse biological roles in vertebrates; these include acting as a vital structural component of connective tissues; the formation of loose hydrated matrices that allow cells to divide and migrate during development, immune cell adhesion, and activation; and in intracellular signaling (1Lee J.Y.

This wide range of activities in fact results from its interactions with a large number of proteins termed as hyaladherin that exhibit significant differences in their tissue expression, cellular localization, specificity, affinity, and regulation (2Day A.J.

The cDNA encoding hyaluronan-binding protein 1 has been cloned by immunoscreening the human skin fibroblast expression library, sequenced, and overexpressed (7Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 269: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis confirmed that although HABP1 is synthesized as pro-protein form of 282 amino acids, the first 73 NH2-terminal residues are cleaved immediately to generate a mature form of HABP1. The presence of an HA-binding motif has been confirmed, and subsequently the recombinant protein has been shown to bind HA. The multifunctional nature of HABP1 is revealed due to its sequence identity with p32, a protein co-purified with splicing factor SF2 (12Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and with the receptor of globular head of complement factor 1q (gC1qR) (13Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis C.A. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and is represented as synonyms of C1QBP, gC1qR, and p32 (GenBank™ accession number NP_001203). Many homologous and identical genes of this molecule have been identified in eukaryotic species, ranging from fungi to mammals from sequence analysis data as well as biochemical studies (14Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This protein is reported by several investigators (15Soltys B.J. Kang D. Gupta R.S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 114: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Brokstad K.A. Kalland K.H. Russell W.C. Matthews D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1161-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to be present in cytosol, mitochondria, and cell surface in different cell types. Even its presence in the nucleus of virally transformed cell lines is demonstrated. This is probably explained as the role of HABP1 in cellular signaling is well documented and has been strengthened by our recent observations that being an endogenous substrate of ERK1/ERK2, it translocated to nucleus upon phosphorylation (17Majumdar M. Meenakshi J. Goswami S. Datta K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of HABP1 showed that it exists as a homotrimer, and each protomer consists of seven consecutive twisted anti-parallel β-sheets flanked by one NH2-terminal and two COOH-terminal α-helices and that the terminal α-helices have extensive intraas well as intermolecular contacts. It has been postulated that these terminal helices are critical for maintaining the trimeric assembly and protein-protein interactions (14Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Among these structural arrangements, the HA-binding motif in each trimeric assembly is solvent-exposed. In our previous report (18Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we have shown that HABP1 exists predominantly as a non-covalently linked trimer near physiological conditions and as a hexamer (dimer of trimers) in the oxidative environment. The isoelectric point (pI) of HABP1 is 4.10, and there are more than average polar amino acid residues (43%) present in the molecule. In addition, asymmetric charge distribution on the surface of HABP1 allows the predominance of electrostatic interactions in dictating its folding topology and tertiary interactions. The relative role of the contribution of electrostatic interactions to protein stability, compared with that of hydrophobic interactions, has been the subject of long-standing queries (19Records Jr., M.T. Zhang W. Anderson C.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 281-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examine the physical stability, structural flexibility, and conformational diversity of HABP1 under in vitro conditions as a function of ionic strength to provide a rationale for the marginal stability at neutral pH and to explain its differential binding toward ligands. Materials—EAH-Sepharose 4B, Superose-6 column, and low molecular weight markers were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals (unless otherwise mentioned) were obtained from Sigma. For every purpose MilliQ™ grade water was used. Purification and Estimation of HABP and Preparation of Its Polyclonal Antibodies—Recombinant HABP1 (amino acids 74–282, with Leu74 to Met74 substitution) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as described earlier (7Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 269: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HABP1 was purified by a 65–90% ammonium sulfate cut, followed by ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ™ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences), interfaced with an FPLC™ system (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.2% 2-mercaptoehanol, pH 7.5, followed by hyaluronan-Sepharose affinity column chromatography with the modification of an earlier report (18Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified HABP1 was further purified by size exclusion chromatography in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. The antibodies against the purified recombinant HABP1 were raised in New Zealand White rabbit as reported earlier (7Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 269: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For all practical purposes the concentration of a known aliquot was determined in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 6 m guanidinium HCl by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm at 25 °C on a Cary100 Bio UV-visible double beam spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Australia) interfaced with peltier thermal controller. The molar extinction coefficient of denatured HABP1 was calculated by the method reported earlier (20Gill S.C. Hippel V H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 6: 319-326Crossref Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) and was found to be 22,190 at 280 nm, which corresponds to A 0.1% = 0.932. Gel Permeation Chromatography—Gel permeation chromatography of HABP1 was carried out on Superose 6™ (1 × 30 cm) analytical column (Amersham Biosciences) interfaced with an FPLC™ system in 10 mm phosphate buffer, containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v) and varying concentrations of either NaCl or KCl, pH 7.2, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Typically 100 μl of 1 mg/ml HABP1 in desired buffer was injected in each case. The standard molecular weight markers of known molecular weight and Stokes radius, e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, 46 Å), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 35.5 Å), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 30.5 Å), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa, 20.9 Å), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, 16.4 Å), were independently run in different cases before and after each run. Calculation of Stokes radius was done by the method reported earlier (21Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 22Denning P.D.

Covalent Cross-linking of HABP1 Subunits—To HABP1 (0.2 μm) in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing varying amounts of NaCl (0–1 m), an aliquot of 25% (mass/volume) glutaraldehyde was added so as to make a final concentration ranging from 1 to 4% of glutaraldehyde. This sample was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min followed by quenching of the cross-linking reaction by adding 30 mm of 2-mercaptoethanol (23Ahmad A. Akhtar M.S. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After 20 min of incubation sodium deoxycholate stock was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 0.3% (w/v). The pH of the reaction mixture (in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing varying amounts of NaCl, pH 7.2) was lowered to 2.0–2.5 by addition of concentrated orthophosphoric acid that resulted in the co-precipitation of cross-linked HABP1 with sodium deoxycholate. After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 4 °C) the precipitate was re-dissolved in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 90–100 °C for 3 min in a water bath and analyzed by electrophoresis. ANS Binding Assay—The ANS binding assay was performed as reported earlier (24Yoshimura T. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reagent 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS), dissolved in water, was added to the protein samples, in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing different amounts of NaCl, to a final concentration of 5 μm and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in each case. ANS added samples of HABP1 were excited at 380 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded from 390 to 690 nm. Circular Dichroism Spectral Studies—All of the far-UV CD spectra of HABP1 were recorded on a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing different amounts of NaCl to achieve the desired ionic strength from 250 to 190 nm at 10 °C. The samples were prepared 4 h before recording the spectra in desired buffer and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g prior to recording. A rectangular cuvette of 2 mm path length was used throughout the experiment. The concentration of protein was kept constant at 10 μm. Data were recorded at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with a response time of 1 s at a bandwidth of 1 nm, and data were accumulated at 0.1-nm step intervals. The buffer base line was subtracted in each case. Estimation of secondary structural content was performed using the software supplied with the instrument. Fluorescence Measurement—All of the fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Cary Eclipse™ spectrofluorimeter (Varian Inc. Australia) at 25 °C. The concentration of the protein (0.05 mg/ml) was chosen so that the absorbance at 280 nm was always ≤0.1 to avoid any inner filter effect. Prior to every run, buffers and samples were either filtered through 0.22-μ Millipore membranes or centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The path length of 1 cm, excitation and emission slit width of 2.5 and 5 nm, respectively, and photomultiplier voltage of 600 V were kept constant for all the fluorescence measurements. The base-line correction was done with buffer alone prior to every run. For intrinsic fluorescence measurements, samples containing same amount of protein and varying amounts of NaCl were excited at 282 nm, and the emission was recorded at 350 nm. Iodide Quenching—0.05 mg/ml HABP1 in 10 mm phosphate buffer with varying amounts of NaCl were incubated with 0–0.2 m potassium iodide in the presence of 10 μm sodium thiosulfate for 1 h at 25 °C, excited at 295 nm, and the emission was recorded at 350 nm, and the emission intensity was plotted against the quencher concentration. N-(1-Anilinonaphthyl-4)maleimide (ANM) Labeling of HABP1 and Its Fluorescence Measurement—N-(1-Anilinonaphthyl-4)maleimide was covalently attached to the only cysteine (Cys186) present in HABP1 by using the method of Ohyashiki et al. (25Ohyashiki T. Sekine T. Kanaoka Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 351: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 1 mg/ml HABP1 in 10 mm phosphate buffer was treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris/H2SO4 buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 μm dithiothreitol. To this solution, 1 mm of final concentration of ANM, dissolved in trace amount of acetone, was added and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm of dithiothreitol and dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer containing different amounts of NaCl. The number of anilinonaphthyl (AN) group was determined spectrophotometrically with a millimolar extinction coefficient of 10.8 mm–1 cm–1 at 345 nm (24Yoshimura T. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The labeling is found to be 0.96 mol of AN group per mol of HABP1 monomer (considering the sequence-derived molecular mass of 23,801.1 Da for HABP1). For monitoring the conformational change associated around Cys186 the samples were excited at 350 nm, and the emission was recorded at 460 nm. To examine the resonance energy transfer, samples were excited at 295 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 510 nm with different amounts of NaCl added to 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Base-line correction was done with the buffer alone in each case. Limited Proteolysis—HABP1 (1 μm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was incubated with varying amounts of NaCl to achieve the desired ionic strength for 2 h at 25 °C followed by incubation with trypsin (protease/HABP1 ratio 1:100 w/w) for 2 h at 25 °C in a 200-μl reaction volume. At higher salt concentrations the protease enzyme ratio was increased so as to compensate for the loss of enzyme activity as a result of the increase in ionic strength as described earlier (26Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Wozniak A. Hult T. Lindberg U. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The proteolysis was stopped using soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen) by adding 1:2 w/w enzyme inhibitor ratio (26Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Wozniak A. Hult T. Lindberg U. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 200 μl of this digest was injected in high resolution Sephacryl S200™ (16:60) pre-packed column interfaced with AKTA™ Basic (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm of NaCl at a elution rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 225 nm. Ligand Binding Assays—Microtiter plate-binding assays were carried out to investigate the effect of ionic strength on the interactions of HA, DMA, and C1q with HABP1. The assays, which are based on those described previously (27Khoda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), determine colorimetrically the level of binding of HABP1 to wells coated with HA, c1q, or DMA. All dilutions and incubations were performed in standard assay buffer (SAB, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) containing varying amounts of NaCl to achieve the desired ionic strength at room temperature. All washes were performed in SAB containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Plastic Costar flat bottomed and high binding microtiter plates (EIA/RIA) were coated (in triplicate) overnight with 100 μl/well of 10 μg/ml HA and DMA, prepared as described earlier (29Kumar R. Roychoudhary N. Salunke D.M. Datta K. J. Biosci. 2001; 26: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and c1q in 20 mm carbonate buffer (Na2CO3-NaHCO3), pH 9.6, at 4 °C. Control wells were treated with buffer alone. The coating solution was removed, and the plates were washed three times, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes. Finally, the respective wells were rinsed three times with SAB containing different amounts of salt. 100 μl of 50 μg/ml HABP1 in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing different amounts of NaCl was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times, and 100 μl of a 1:5000 dilution of polyclonal anti-HABP1 antibodies (in SAB) was added and incubated for 90 min, followed by five washes. 100 μl/well of a 1:30,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in SAB was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies were sipped out of the wells and washed five times and finally rinsed with substrate buffer (100 mm phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0). 100 μl of 0.6 mg/ml solution of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) in substrate buffer containing 3 μl of H2O2/ml of buffer was added to each well and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C for color development. For competitive binding assays, 100 μl/well of 10 μg/ml of DMA was coated on microtiter plates and incubated with 100 μl of 1 μg/ml of biotinylated HABP1 in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing different amounts of salt, pH 7.2, which was preincubated with varying amounts of unlabeled HA, DMA, or C1q. The bound HABP1 was detected by 1:30,000 dilution of ExtrAvidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate using ABTS as a substrate. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined on a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader). All absorbances were corrected against blank wells. Each data point is the average of three similar sets of experiments. For absolute binding absorbance at 405 nm was plotted against the increasing salt concentrations, and for competitive binding assays the percentage inhibition was plotted against increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands at different salt concentrations. Decreased Hydrodynamic Volume of Trimeric HABP1 with Increasing Ionic Strength—In order to identify the oligomeric state of the molecule under the reducing conditions as a function of salt, covalent cross-linking of the oligomeric subunit was performed under the conditions of different ionic strength used throughout the experiment. The peak fractions of the protein eluted as a function of ionic strength on Superose 6 HR 10/30 column were cross-linked using 2% glutaraldehyde and examined on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The data showed that HABP1 exists predominantly as trimer in equilibrium with a small proportion of monomer in the absence of salt (Fig. 1A). The relative band intensities of the cross-linked product in the absence of salt indicate that this equilibrium is biased in the favor of trimer. However, this protein exists only as a trimer in the presence of salt as low as 10 mm. In order to examine if electrostatic repulsion in HABP1, an acidic protein, is indeed responsible for expanded structure in low ionic environment, size exclusion chromatography was carried out in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol with varying concentrations of NaCl 0.01–1 m (Fig. 1B). The elution peak at low ionic strength (0.01 m) is broad and diffused as against the peaks at higher ionic strengths, which are relatively sharp. The broad diffused nature of the peak under low ionic strength is perhaps due to the interactions of the gel filtration medium with the conformational ensemble of HABP1 that includes variations from the crystallographically observed compact structure. A gradual increase in elution volume (V e) was observed with increasing salt concentrations, which reflects a gradual decrease in the hydrodynamic volume (V h) of the molecule. Therefore size exclusion chromatographic data were further analyzed for calculating the hydrodynamic size of the molecule by comparing with the standard molecular weight markers of known Stokes radii as described earlier and plotted against the ionic strength (Fig. 1C, open circles). To see any cation specificity, a similar set of experiments was carried out in the presence of KCl, and the Stokes radius was plotted against the increasing concentration as shown in Fig. 1C (solid circles). The changes in cation-induced structural compaction did not suggest any specific ion selectivity. The important observations of our study are concerned with strikingly different state of compactness, induced by increasing amounts of salt in the molecular environment. For example, the loosely held trimers in the absence of salt were so expanded that they eluted much earlier than the compact trimer under the conditions involving 150 mm to 1 m NaCl/KCl. As the ionic strength is increased, there is a gradual increase in the compactness of trimer such that the compact form of the trimer has a Stokes radius of 36.9 Å at 150 mm and 31 Å at 1 m salt concentration (Fig. 1C) as compared with the most expanded trimer, which has a Stokes radii of 42 Å. Therefore, the broad peak corresponding to a Stokes radius of nearly 42 Å is apparently not due to any higher order oligomer because the whole experiment is conducted under reducing conditions, and the subsequent cross-linking experiment failed to identify any higher oligomer. To assess further the oligomeric distribution of HABP1 at higher salt concentrations, cross-linking as a function of glutaraldehyde was performed, and no detectable oligomer other than trimer was observed until 4% of glutaraldehyde at these salt concentrations (data not shown). Thus our results suggest that HABP1 exists as a loosely held expanded trimer in low ionic environments, which undergoes structural compaction with increasing ionic strength. Existence of Expanded Trimeric HABP1 as a Molten Globule-like State in Low Ionic Environment—The presence of an expanded structure of trimeric HABP1 may result in the exposure of the hydrophobic core similar to the molten globule-like state of the molecule, if any. To investigate any such possibility in the case of HABP1, hydrophobic reporter dye, 1,10-anilinonaphthylsulfonate, binding was carried out at different ionic strengths. ANS is a weak fluorescent molecule when free. However, the fluorescence emission intensity increases with a characteristic blue shift in emission maximum when it is bound to the hydrophobic core of the protein (24Yoshimura T. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ANS binding was observed from enhancement of the emission intensity with a blue shift of nearly 50 nm with respect to free ANS under low ionic strength where protein exists predominantly as a loosely held trimer in dynamic equilibrium with a very small proportion of monomer (Fig. 2). Our observations on the significant increase of ANS binding suggests that the expanded trimer is somewhat similar to a molten globule-like state under low ionic environments. With an increase in ionic strength HABP1 folds appropriately into a stable conformation so that the hydrophobic core is inaccessible for ANS binding. Effect of Ionic Strength on the Structural Properties of HABP1—To probe the ionic environment-mediated structural changes of HABP1 from expanded molten globule-like state to a compact stable folded form, spectroscopic investigations (far-UV CD, intrinsic as well as extrinsic fluorescence, fluorescence quenching, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments) were carried out as a function of ionic strength. To probe the structural changes in trimeric HABP1 as a function of ionic strength, its secondary structural content was investigated by far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. The spectra were recorded in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at different ionic strength conditions using sodium chloride (0–1 m) and are presented in Fig. 3 after subtracting the buffer base line. The minima in the absence of salt lies at 205 nm, although it gives a double minima at 219.3 and 210 nm at hig"

The activities and subcellular localization of PI 3-kinases were shown to be regulated by phosphorylation. Previously we demonstrated that class II HsPIK3-C2α becomes phosphorylated upon inhibition of RNA pol II-dependent transcription (Didichenko, S. A., and Thelen, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 48135–48142). In this study we investigated cell cycle-dependent and genotoxic stress-induced phosphorylation of HsPIK3-C2α. We find that the kinase becomes phosphorylated upon exposure of cells to UV irradiation and in proliferating cells at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. Stress-dependent and mitotic phosphorylation of HsPIK3-C2α occurs on the same serine residue (Ser259) within a recognition motif for proline-directed kinases. Mitotic phosphorylation of HsPIK3-C2α can be attributed to Cdc2 activity, and stress-induced phosphorylation of HsPIK3-C2α is mediated by JNK/SAPK. The protein level of HsPIK3-C2α is regulated by proteolysis in a cell cycle-dependent manner and in response of cells to stress. Phosphorylation appears to be a prerequisite for proteasome-dependent degradation of HsPIK3-C2α and may therefore contribute indirectly to the regulation of the activity of the kinase.

Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinases phosphorylate the D3 hydroxyl group on the inositol ring leading to 3-phosphoinositides which act as membrane-embedded second messengers mediating the activation of downstream effectors (3Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Class I PI 3-kinases are heterodimeric enzymes consisting of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit. They are involved primarily in growth factor and chemotactic agonist-mediated signal transduction (4Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 5Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In vitro, these PI 3-kinases are able to utilize phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 as substrates, but most likely produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vivo (6Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Following activation of resting cells, these kinases are recruited rapidly from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where they generate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Class II PI 3-kinases are monomeric proteins.

Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Curr.

Members of class II are distinguished from other PI 3-kinases by the presence of two tandem domains at their carboxyl terminus, a phox homology domain and a C2 domain, a module that is known to confer Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding (16Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). However, the C2 domains of class II PI 3-kinases lack a critical Asp residue in the calcium binding loop (17Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the finding that they do not bind to membranes in a calcium-dependent manner (14MacDougall L.K.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3817-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In vitro, all class II PI 3-kinases phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P, but their in vivo substrate remains to be determined (2Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Both HsPI3K-C2α and HsPI3K-C2β are implicated in signaling downstream of epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (18Arcaro A. Zvelebil M.J. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Waterfield M.D. Domin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3817-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HsPI3K-C2α was shown to concentrate in the trans-Golgi network and in clathrin-coated pits (19Domin J. Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Keen J.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11943-11950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas PI3K-C2β was found in the nuclei of rat liver cells (20Sindic A. Aleksandrova A. Fields A.P.

In general, the role of class II PI 3-kinases in signal transduction and mode of activation is poorly understood, and specific downstream targets have not been characterized. Class I PI 3-kinases activities were shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (21Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.-M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit p85 by the catalytic subunit p110α of class I PI 3-kinase (p110/p85 heterodimer) down-regulates lipid kinase activity of the complex (21Carpenter C.L.

Phosphorylation of class II PI 3-kinases was demonstrated; however, the physiological role of this phosphorylation remained unclear. Increased phosphorylation of class II PI 3-kinase C2α was found to correlate with a moderately elevated enzyme activity in insulin-stimulated cells (24Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data demonstrated that the phosphorylation status neither changes the lipid kinase activity of PI3K-C2α nor affects the substrate specificity, but influences the intranuclear localization (1Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2α induced by genotoxic stress and during the cell cycle. We show that the kinase becomes phosphorylated upon exposure of cells to UV irradiation and in proliferating cells at the G2/M transition of cell cycle. Stress-dependent and mitotic phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2α occurs on the same serine residue (Ser259) within a recognition motif (serine-proline sequence) for proline-directed kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdk). By using different selective inhibitors of MAP kinases and Cdks in in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that Cdc2 mediates mitotic phosphorylation, whereas JNK/SAPK is responsible for stress-induced phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2α. In either case phosphorylation provides a signal for proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein. Antibodies—Antibodies against PI3K-C2α (AXIX and AXXIII) were described previously (1Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Clontech, anti-Cdc2 polyclonal rabbit antibody was from Oncogene, anti-human cyclin B1 antibody was from Pharmingen (BD), anti-phospho-Jun (pSer63) and anti-phospho-Jun (pSer73) rabbit immunoaffinity-purified IgG were from Upstate Biotechnology. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad. Plasmids—The cDNA encoding human HsPI3K-C2α (8Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) was a kindly provided by Dr. J. Domin (London). Various HsPI3K-C2α cDNAs were amplified by the PCR using gene-specific primers with incorporated restriction sites to facilitate their cloning into appropriate vectors. For expression in bacterial cells, GST-tagged fusion constructs were generated by cloning wild-type and mutant HsPI3K-C2α cDNAs into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). For expression in mammalian cells the cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). To generate pEGFP: ΔHsPI3K-C2α expressing GFP-ΔHsPI3K-C2α, a PCR product corresponding to the amino acids 240–275 of HsPI3K-C2α was inserted into XhoI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1. HsPI3K-C2α point mutations, S254A, S259A, S259D, S259E, S262A, and S264A were created by PCR amplification from pEGFP-C1:ΔHsPI3K-C2α, using mutant sequence oligonucleotides. pBK-CMV:myc-HsPI3K-C2α, which encodes full-length HsPI3K-C2α tagged at the NH2 terminus with myc epitope was constructed as follows. The SacI-BspEI fragment from pBK-CMV-HsPI3K-C2α (8Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem.

To generate pEGFP-C1:GFP-HA-HsPI3K-C2α, which encodes complete HsPI3K-C2α double tagged at the NH2 terminus with GFP and HA epitope (GFP-HsPI3K-C2α), the SacI-EcoRI fragment from pBK-CMV:HA-HsPI3K-C2α was cloned into SacI-EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1. To generate pEGFP-N1:myc-HsPI3K-C2α-GFP that encoded full-length HsPI3K-C2α tagged at the NH2 terminus with myc epitope and at the COOH terminus with GFP (HsPI3K-C2α-GFP), the SacI-AccI fragment from pBK-CMV:myc-HsPI3K-C2α containing the myc-tagged HsPI3K-C2α coding sequence up to 4884 bp was cloned into to pEGFP-N1:HsPI3K-C2α-ΔN, in which the COOH-terminal fragment of HsPI3K-C2α (4884–5055 bp) was joined in-frame to GFP. JNKK2 mammalian expression vector (25Wu Z. Wu J. Jacinto E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7407-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was a gift from G. Natoli (Bellinzona). Cell Culture, Synchronization, Transient and Stable Expressions— HeLa (ATCC), MCF7, COS-7, and HEK-293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The following protocols were used to obtain HeLa cells arrested at specific stages of the cell cycle. Cells, enriched in G1, were obtained by treatment with mimosine (Sigma) at 400 μm for 20 h. For early S phase arrest, subconfluent cultures were blocked by serum deprivation for 48 h followed by the addition of 5 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) for 24 h (26Al Mohanna M.A. Al Khodairy F.M. Krezolek Z. Bertilsson P.A. Al Houssein K.A. Aboussekhra A. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To obtain a cell population enriched in G2 phase, cells were presynchronized in S phase as described above and then released by transferring into fresh medium for 8 h. For M phase synchronization, cells were treated with nocodazole (Sigma) at 400 ng/ml for 16 h before collecting mitotic cells by shake off. Cell cycle distributions were confirmed by flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorter). For fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of DNA content, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 90% methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. After an additional wash in phosphate-buffered saline cells were resuspended in 4 mm sodium-citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A in the presence of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min at 37 °C. To inhibit proteasome activity, MG132 (Calbiochem) was added to cells at a concentration of 20 μm. Transient and stable transfections were carried out using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transient expression of GFP-HsPI3K-C2α and the mutants (S259A and S259D) COS-7 cells were transfected with the corresponding plasmids: pEGFP-C1:GFP-HA-HsPI3K-C2α, pEGFP-C1:GFP-HA-HsPI3K-C2α/S259A, and pEGFP-C1:HA-HsPI3K-C2α/S259D. For generation of stable HEK-293 lines expressing wild-type and mutant HsPI3K-C2α-GFP fusion proteins, HEK-293 cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1:myc-HsPI3K-C2α-GFP or pEGFP-N1:myc-HsPI3K-C2α/S259A-GFP. Two days after transfection, cells were replated in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. G418-resistant colonies, selected at 2–3 weeks after transfection, were subcloned and analyzed for the expression of recombinant proteins by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. UV and γ-Irradiation—Cells were exposed to genotoxic agents and analyzed 1.5 h later. An UV dose of 300 J/m2 was delivered in a single pulse using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Prior to pulsing, the medium was removed, being replaced immediately after the treatment. 100 Gy of γ-irradiation was delivered using a Gammacell 1000 apparatus. Gel Electrophoresis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on 8 or 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels prepared from the stock (33.5% acrylamide, 0.3% bisacrylamide) and blotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and probed with specific antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were decorated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA), supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (40 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 μm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche). Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were precleared with Gamma-Bind Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation of HsPI3K-C2α with antibody AXXIII was carried out at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Immune complexes were bound to GammaBind Plus-Sepharose for 30 min, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice in lysis buffer, once in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS; then in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), once in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, and finally in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.05% SDS. For λ-phosphatase treatment immunoprecipitates were additionally washed twice in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35) and resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer. After warming up at 30 °C for 3 min, 50 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) was added, and samples were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Subconfluent cultures of HeLa cells were labeled overnight with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences)/ml in methionine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. After labeling cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, replated (1:3 dilution), and chased with complete DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h. To obtain mitotic cells, 400 ng/ml nocodazole was added to the medium for the last 36 h of the chase. Labeled mitotic cells were collected by shake off, washed three times in prewarmed DMEM, and released into fresh complete medium for 3 h. For metabolic labeling of cells at M/G1 transition of cell cycle, nocodazole-treated mitotic HeLa cells were released into the labeling DMEM in the presence of 50 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 or 3 h. Cells were subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-HsPI3K-C2α antibody (AXXIII) as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and visualized by autoradiography and immunoblotting. Kinase and Protease Inhibitor Treatments—Roscovitine (Calbiochem) was used to inhibit Cdk activity. HeLa cells at late S phase (6 h after release from aphidicolin block) were treated or not with 30 μm roscovitine for 2 h. 400 ng/ml nocodazole was added and treatment continued for 15 h. Nonadhering mitotic and adhering G2 cells were collected by mechanical shock and trypsin treatment, respectively. Nocodazole-arrested mitotic HeLa cells were treated with 75 μm roscovitine for 15, 45, and 90 min. For okadaic acid treatment nocodazole-arrested mitotic HeLa cells were treated with 0.5 μm okadaic acid for 30 min, then 75 μm roscovitine was added, and treatment continued for 30 min. SP600125 (Tocris) was used to inhibit JNK activation, and PD98059 and SB202190 (both from Alexis) were used to inhibit ERK and p38 activation, respectively. HeLa cells were preatreated with the inhibitors at concentrations indicated for 30 min before UV irradiation. Irradiated cells were cultured for 90 min in the presence of the inhibitors before harvesting. The specific protease inhibitors MG132, ALLM, and lactacystin were from Calbiochem. HEK-293 cells were UV irradiated as described above. After 2 h of recovery in fresh medium, cells were treated with protease inhibitors (20 μm MG132, 100 μm ALLM, or 50 μm lactacystin) for the indicated times prior to Western blot analysis. In Vitro Kinase Assay—HsPI3K-C2α was immunoprecipitated from mimosine-treated HeLa cells using affinity-purified anti-HsPI3K-C2α antibody AXIX (1Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The antibody-antigen complexes were collected with GammaBind Plus-Sepharose and used as substrate for in vitro phosphorylation by cellular extracts. To obtain cellular extracts, pellets of interphase or mitotic HeLa cells were resuspended in 2 pellet volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche)) and disrupted by brief sonication. The resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (∼10 mg of protein/ml) were supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2 and used as a source of kinases. HsPI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates were mixed with supernatants in a final volume of 100 μl, and phosphorylation assays were initiated by adding 1 mm ATP. Assays were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% of Triton X-100. HsPI3K-C2α immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. For in vitro phosphorylation GST-ΔHsPI3K-C2α fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain (BL21) and purified by absorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion proteins were left attached to the beads, and phosphorylation reactions with cellular extracts were carried out as described above in the presence of 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 mm ATP. In vitro phosphorylation of GST-ΔHsPI3K-C2α and GFP-HsPI3K-C2α fusion proteins by 10 units of purified recombinant human Cdc2-cyclin B (Calbiochem) was performed in Cdc2-kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm ATP. Soluble GST-ΔHsPI3K-C2α was used as substrate in phosphorylation assays with immunoprecipitated Cdc2. Cdc2 was immunoprecipitated from cytosols of HeLa cells as described above, immunocomplexes bound to GammaBind Plus-Sepharose beads were additionally washed twice in the kinase buffer, and the reaction was initiated by addition of purified GST-ΔHsPI3K-C2α and ATP (100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP). Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described previously (1Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using the methanol fixation protocol. UV-induced and Cell Cycle-dependent Phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2α—Our previous immunofluorescence studies revealed that in interphase HeLa cells HsPI3K-C2α is localized to nuclear speckles together with the components of the splicing apparatus (1Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D or α-amanitin causes subnuclear relocation of the kinase and is accompanied by phosphorylation of the protein, which can be measured as mobility shift of HsPI3K-C2α during SDS-PAGE. To investigate whether down-regulation of transcription caused by different types of genotoxic stress results in phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2α, we exposed cells to DNA-damaging treatment such as UV light or ionizing radiation. Exposure of HeLa and MCF7 cells to UV irradiation induced a collapse of nuclear HsPI3K-C2α-positive speckles (Fig. 1A) similar to that observed in actinomycin D-treated cells: speckles lose their irregular shape, become round, and fuse into larger clusters (1Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This effect was associated with the increased phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2α, as measured by its mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1B). When cell extracts were treated with λ-phosphatase the appearance of the slower migrating band was abolished (not shown). In contrast to UV-treated cells, exposure of cells to γ-irradiation neither changed subnuclear localization of HsPI3K-C2α (not shown) nor induced its phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that HsPI3K-C2α specifically participates in UV-induced damage response. The observation that phosphorylation of HsPI3K-C2α correlates with changes in its subnuclear localization let us to speculate that the phosphorylation status of the kinase may also be cell cycle-dependent, because in mitotic cells HsPI3K-C2α-positive speckles dissolve, and the kinase becomes equally distributed over the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). We used HeLa cells to examine whether HsPI3K-C2α demonstrates different phosphorylation patterns during the cell cycle. Cells were synchronized in different stages of the cell cycle as follows: at late G1 with mimosine, at M with nocodazole, in early S phase by serum deprivation followed by an aphidicolin block, and cells enriched in G2 phase were obtained 8 h after release from aphidicolin block (26Al Mohanna M.A. Al Khodairy F.M. Krezolek Z. Bertilsson P.A. Al Houssein K.A. Aboussekhra A. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Proteins from corresponding cell lysates were fractioned by SDS-PAGE, and HsPI3K-C2α was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). In mimosine-treated cells HsPI3K-C2α was detected as a single band, in cells blocked in S phase a second slower migrating band became visible. Two bands, a faster and a slower migrating, of equal intensity were apparent in cells enriched in G2 phase. A single slower migrating band was found in prometaphase-blocked mitotic cells. To confirm that altered gel mobility of HsPI3K-C2α was the result of phosphorylation, protein extracts from synchronized HeLa cells were treated with λ-phosphatase (Fig. 2). Phosphatase treatment resulted in the collapse of the slower migrating band of the kinase, indicating that indeed retarded mobility of HsPI3K-C2α during SDS-PAGE is a consequence of phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that HsPI3K-C2α undergoes a cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation that reaches its maximum in mitosis. HsPI3K-C2α Can Be Phosphorylated in Vitro by Kinases Present in HeLa Cell Extracts—The initial strategy to identify residues on which HsPI3K-C2α becomes phosphorylated upon UV irradiation and during cell cycle was to label HeLa cells metabolically in the presence of 32Pi. In several attempts we did not succeed to obtain sufficient amounts of in vivo 32P-labeled HsPI3K-C2α by immunoprecipitation to perform phosphopeptide mapping analysis. To overcome this problem, we developed an in vitro phosphorylation assay that allowed the identification of potential phosphorylation sites. As a substrate for phosphorylation we used HsPI3K-C2α immunoprecipitated from mimosine-treated HeLa cells. Concentrated high speed supernatants (S100) prepared from HeLa cells (asynchronously growing or mitotic) were used as sources of kinases. The supernatants are devoid of HsPI3K-C2α as shown previously (1Didichenko S.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48135-48142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which excluded any additional input of the a"
