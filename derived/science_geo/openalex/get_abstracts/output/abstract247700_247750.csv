https://openalex.org/W2149993601,"Yeast Rpd3 histone deacetylase plays an important role at actively transcribed genes. We characterized two distinct Rpd3 complexes, Rpd3L and Rpd3S, by MudPIT analysis. Both complexes shared a three subunit core and Rpd3L contains unique subunits consistent with being a promoter targeted corepressor. Rco1 and Eaf3 were subunits specific to Rpd3S. Mutants of RCO1 and EAF3 exhibited increased acetylation in the FLO8 and STE11 open reading frames (ORFs) and the appearance of aberrant transcripts initiating within the body of these ORFs. Mutants in the RNA polymerase II-associated SET2 histone methyltransferase also displayed these defects. Set2 functioned upstream of Rpd3S and the Eaf3 methyl-histone binding chromodomain was important for recruitment of Rpd3S and for deacetylation within the STE11 ORF. These data indicate that Pol II-associated Set2 methylates H3 providing a transcriptional memory which signals for deacetylation of ORFs by Rpd3S. This erases transcription elongation-associated acetylation to suppress intragenic transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2010077871,"It is widely accepted that the p53 tumor suppressor restricts abnormal cells by induction of growth arrest or by triggering apoptosis. Here we show that, in addition, p53 protects the genome from oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major cause of DNA damage and genetic instability. In the absence of severe stresses, relatively low levels of p53 are sufficient for upregulation of several genes with antioxidant products, which is associated with a decrease in intracellular ROS. Downregulation of p53 results in excessive oxidation of DNA, increased mutation rate and karyotype instability, which are prevented by incubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Dietary supplementation with NAC prevented frequent lymphomas characteristic of Trp53-knockout mice, and slowed the growth of lung cancer xenografts deficient in p53. Our results provide a new paradigm for a nonrestrictive tumor suppressor function of p53 and highlight the potential importance of antioxidants in the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2126188271,"The yeast histone deacetylase Rpd3 can be recruited to promoters to repress transcription initiation. Biochemical, genetic, and gene-expression analyses show that Rpd3 exists in two distinct complexes. The smaller complex, Rpd3C(S), shares Sin3 and Ume1 with Rpd3C(L) but contains the unique subunits Rco1 and Eaf3. Rpd3C(S) mutants exhibit phenotypes remarkably similar to those of Set2, a histone methyltransferase associated with elongating RNA polymerase II. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and biochemical experiments indicate that the chromodomain of Eaf3 recruits Rpd3C(S) to nucleosomes methylated by Set2 on histone H3 lysine 36, leading to deacetylation of transcribed regions. This pathway apparently acts to negatively regulate transcription because deleting the genes for Set2 or Rpd3C(S) bypasses the requirement for the positive elongation factor Bur1/Bur2."

https://openalex.org/W1994015824,"In response to DNA damage, the p53 tumor suppressor can elicit either apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest and repair, but how this critical decision is made in specific cell types remains largely undefined. We investigated the mechanism by which the transcriptional repressor Slug specifically rescues hematopoietic progenitor cells from lethal doses of gamma radiation. We show that Slug is transcriptionally induced by p53 upon irradiation and then protects the damaged cell from apoptosis by directly repressing p53-mediated transcription of puma, a key BH3-only antagonist of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. We established the physiologic significance of Slug-mediated repression of puma by demonstrating that mice deficient in both genes survive doses of total-body irradiation that lethally deplete hematopoietic progenitor populations in mice lacking only slug. Thus, Slug functions downstream of p53 in developing blood cells as a critical switch that prevents their apoptosis by antagonizing the trans-activation of puma by p53."
https://openalex.org/W2031143675,"Sir2 is a conserved deacetylase that modulates life span in yeast, worms, and flies and stress response in mammals. In yeast, Sir2 is required for maintaining replicative life span, and increasing Sir2 dosage can delay replicative aging. We address the role of Sir2 in regulating chronological life span in yeast. Lack of Sir2 along with calorie restriction and/or mutations in the yeast AKT homolog, Sch9, or Ras pathways causes a dramatic chronological life-span extension. Inactivation of Sir2 causes uptake and catabolism of ethanol and upregulation of many stress-resistance and sporulation genes. These changes while sufficient to extend chronological life span in wild-type yeast require severe calorie restriction or additional mutations to extend life span of sir2Delta mutants. Our results demonstrate that effects of SIR2 on chronological life span are opposite to replicatve life span and suggest that the relevant activities of Sir2-like deacetylases may also be complex in higher eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2083331590,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstrated to act as second messengers in a number of signal transduction pathways, including NFκB. However, the mechanism(s) by which ROS regulate NFκB remain unclear and controversial. In the present report, we describe a mechanism whereby interleukin-1β (IL-1β) stimulation of NFκB is partially regulated by H2O2-mediated activation of NIK and subsequent NIK-mediated phosphorylation of IKKα. IL-1β induced H2O2 production in MCF-7 cells and clearance of this ROS through the expression of GPx-1 reduced NFκB transcriptional activation by inhibiting NIK-mediated phosphorylation of IKKα. Although IKKα and IKKβ were both involved in IL-1β-mediated activation of NFκB, only the IKKα-dependent component was modulated by changes in H2O2 levels. Interestingly, in vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated that NIK was activated by a very narrow range of H2O2 (1–10 μm), whereas higher concentrations (100 μm to 1 mm) inhibited NIK activity. Treatment of cells with the general Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid) lead to activation of NFκB and enhanced NIK activity as a IKKα kinase, suggesting that ROS may directly regulate NIK through the inhibition of phosphatases. Recruitment of NIK to TRAF6 following IL-1β stimulation was inhibited by H2O2 clearance and Rac1 siRNA, suggesting that Rac-dependent NADPH oxidase may be a source of ROS required for NIK activation. In summary, our studies have demonstrated that redox regulation of NIK by H2O2 is mechanistically important in IL-1β induction of NFκB activation.

In this context, ROS have been considered second messengers. For example, ROS are generated in response to IL-1β, TNFα, and lipopolysaccharide (3Brigelius-Flohe R. Banning A. Kny M. Bol G.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Forman H.J.

However, despite the fact that ROS have been linked to NFκB activation by certain cytokines, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined and controversial (7Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I.

IL-1β is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in immune and inflammatory responses associated with sepsis (8Walley K.R. Lukacs N.W. Standiford T.J. Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), arthritis (9van den Berg W.B. Z Rheumatol. 1999; 58: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and cancer (10Pantschenko A.G. Pushkar I. Anderson K.H. Wang Y. Miller L.J. Kurtzman S.H. Barrows G. Kreutzer D.L. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 269-284PubMed Google Scholar). Septic shock is a systematic inflammatory response to infection that leads to the overproduction of a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines. TNFα and IL-1β are two critical cytokines produced during septic shock, which significantly contribute to morbidity associated with this disease (8Walley K.R. Lukacs N.W. Standiford T.J. Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pinner R.W. Teutsch S.M. Simonsen L. Klug L.A. Graber J.M. Clarke M.J. Berkelman R.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 275: 189-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β exerts its pleiotropic effects by binding to its receptor (IL-1R1) on the plasma membrane. This initiates the IL-1β signaling cascade by activating structural changes in the receptor that dock cytoplasmic adaptor and effector proteins on the receptor tail (12O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The first set of proteins recruited to the cytoplasmic tail of IL-1R1 following ligand binding include IL-1RacP, MyD88, and Tollip (13Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 14Huang J. Gao X. Li S. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In turn, MyD88 plays an obligatory role in mediating the recruitment of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase family members via interactions with its N-terminal death domain (15Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 17Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Once associated with the receptor complex, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase subsequently recruits TRAF6, a member of the TNF receptor-associated factor family of adaptor proteins (18Qian Y. Commane M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41661-41667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). TRAF6 then recruits and activates TAK1 and/or NIK (19Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), two IKK kinases important in NFκB activation. It has also been suggested that TAK1 and its regulators, TAB1 and -2, might act upstream of NIK (20Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The IL-1β signaling cascade leads to the activation of several key transcription factors that modulate the expression of genes involved in immunity and inflammation. These include NFκB, AP-1, and p38 MAPK (21Fitzgerald K.A. O'Neill L.A. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Uekawa N. Nishikimi A. Isobe K. Iwakura Y. Maruyama M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 575: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). In this context, NFκB is known for its ability to induce inflammatory cytokines, inhibit apoptotic pathways, and lead to the resolution of inflammation (23Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 24Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 25Chen L.W. Egan L. Li Z.W. Greten F.R. Kagnoff M.F. Karin M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). NFκB is composed of homo- and hetero-dimers of the Rel family of transcription factors. p65 and p50 subunits represent the most common types of subunits found in the activated NFκB complex. Activation of NFκB is controlled by a family of IκB inhibitory proteins (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ) that sequester the NFκB complex in the cytoplasm by masking its nuclear localization signal. Pro-inflammatory stimuli that activate NFκB lead to the phosphorylation of IκBα on two N-terminal serines (Ser-32 and Ser-36). This results in the ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα and the mobilization of NFκB to the nucleus where it activates transcription (26Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Two IKK kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, have the ability to phosphorylate these two serines on IκBα (27Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 28Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ, together with IKKγ, form a large complex within the cell (29Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinases known to phosphorylate IKKα and IKKβ include NIK (30Hirano M. Osada S. Aoki T. Hirai S. Hosaka M. Inoue J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13234-13238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), MEKK1 (31Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), NFκB-activating kinase (32Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M. Nakanishi M. Nature. 2000; 404: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and TAK1 (19Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) is a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family, which has Ser/Thr kinase activity. NIK was first identified as a TRAF2 interacting protein. Further studies found that it could also associate with TRAF6 and TRAF5 (33Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). NIK is dedicated to NFκB signaling and contributes to the induction of NFκB by both TNFα and IL-1β (34Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). NIK has been shown to interact with IKKα in yeast two-hybrid systems (35Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) and has the potential to specifically phosphorylate IKKα (36Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ROS play an important role in the activation of NFκB (37Kabe Y. Ando K. Hirao S. Yoshida M. Handa H. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), however, this concept remains controversial (7Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I. Kitagawa M. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Karin M. Kikugawa K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Various forms of ROS, including superoxide anion (O2·¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), have been implicated in cell signaling. ROS are tightly controlled in cells by a group of antioxidant factors, including glutathione peroxide (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, peroxiredoxins, and small factors such as glutathione and thioredoxin. Among these, GPx is a group of selenoenzymes responsible for reducing various hydroperoxides in the presence of the reduced form of glutathione (38Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). At least four GPx isoforms have been identified (39Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohe R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohe L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). GPx-1 is the isoform that exists in the cytoplasm, and it uses glutathione to degrade H2O2 into water. A number of studies have revealed that ROS are involved in IL-1β signal transduction. For example, IL-1β stimulates ROS generation in a number of cell systems (40Meier B. Radeke H.H. Selle S. Younes M. Sies H. Resch K. Habermehl G.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 41Finkel T. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 42Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, studies that have used chemical antioxidants, such as diamide, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and phenylarsine oxide, have shown significant effects on IL-1β-induced signaling (43Bol G.F. Jurrmann N. Brigelius-Flohe R. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Shrivastava A. Aggarwal B.B. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 1999; 1: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although there remain disagreements over the applications of these antioxidants that might weaken this argument (7Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I. Kitagawa M. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Karin M. Kikugawa K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), a number of studies have also used specific ROS modulation enzymes to confirm the importance of ROS. For example, specific antioxidant enzymes, such as GPx-1 and Mn-SOD, have demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on TNFα- or IL-1β-induced signal transduction (6Li Q. Sanlioglu S. Li S. Ritchie T. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 45Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). In addition, factors that control ROS generation by cells have been shown to influence IL-1β induction of NFκB and the transcriptional activation of downstream genes (46Gu Y. Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Souza R.F. Flores S.C. Terada L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17210-17217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 47Jefferies C. Bowie A. Brady G. Cooke E.L. Li X. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of ROS action in the IL-1β pathway remain poorly defined. In this report, we have investigated the role of cellular H2O2 in IL-1β induction of NFκB. Using GPx-1 expression to modulate cellular H2O2, we have demonstrated that H2O2 plays an important role in NIK activation of IKKα following IL-1β stimulation. We found that H2O2 imparts its activation on this cascade by promoting TRAF6 association with NIK and potentially inhibiting phosphatases that inactivate NIK. Reconstitution experiments demonstrated that a very narrow range of H2O2 concentration (1–10 μm) facilitate NIK activation, whereas higher levels of H2O2 inhibit NIK activity. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanism by which ROS act to regulate NFκB activation by IL-1β. Recombinant Adenoviral Vector Infection and siRNA Transfection—Adenoviral infections were performed in serum-free medium for 2 h at an m.o.i. of 500 particles/cell, followed by the addition of an equal volume of fresh media containing 20% fetal bovine serum.

Cell Culture and Treatment—MCF-7 cells (a human breast cancer cell line obtained from ATCC) were chosen for studies due to their low level of endogenous GPx-1. MCF-7 cells were grown in minimal essential medium with Eagle's salts and l-glutamine, 1% minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For H2O2 treatment, concentrated H2O2 (30%) (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) was diluted to 1 m with deionized H2O and added to fresh medium at a final concentration of 1 mm. The spent medium was removed from MCF-7 cells and quickly replaced with medium containing 1 mm H2O2. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h (or as otherwise indicated), the medium was changed to fresh medium without H2O2, and incubation of cells at 37 °C was continued. IL-1β inductions were performed using 1 ng/ml human IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for the indicated times. Control MCF-7 cells were also fed fresh medium but did not receive any treatment. Cells were harvested for luciferase assays at 6 h following H2O2 or IL-1β treatments. MCF-7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and were prepared for each assay accordingly. Western Blots—Cell lysates were prepared and normalized for protein concentrations using a Bio-Rad Kit (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, PA). Western blotting was performed using standard protocols. In brief, 50 μg of crude proteins for each condition were separated on a denaturing 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then blocked and probed with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature using dilutions suggested by the manufacturer. After being washed with blocking buffer several times, the membranes were probed with the appropriate dilution of secondary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using either an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray film, or an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biotech, Lincoln, NE). The antibodies against IKKα, IKKβ, NIK, GST, FLAG, IL-1R1, MEKK1, and TRAF6 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rac1 antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Luciferase Assays—Luciferase activity was measured using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MCF-7 cells were infected with Ad.NFκBLuc 24 h prior to treatment. Ad.NFκBLuc contains the luciferase gene driven by four tandem copies of the NFκB consensus sequence fused to a TATA-like promoter from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. 5 μg of total protein from each sample was used to perform the luciferase assays. Immunoprecipitation—Cell samples were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) at 4 °C for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad kit and 500 μg of cellular protein, and 5 μl of primary antibody was mixed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. Then 50 μl of Protein-A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the mixture, and the mixture was rotated for 4 h. The beads were spun down at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed with ice-cold PBS three times prior to analysis of immunoprecipitates. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Kinases (NIK, MEKK1, IKKα, or IKKβ) were immunoprecipitated with their respective antibodies and then mixed with 1 μg of the appropriate protein substrate (IKKα, IKKβ, or IκBα) in 0.3 mm cold ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μl of kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm nitrophenol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min (or shorter times as indicated), and reactions were then terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer at 98 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to x-ray film. Detection of Cellular ROS Production Using H2DCFDA—Stock solutions of H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were generated in Me2SO at a concentration of 50 μg/ml immediately prior to use. Cells were washed three times with PBS prior to simultaneous treatment with H2DCFDA (10 μm) and IL-1β (1 ng/ml) for 20 min in PBS at 37 °C in the dark. For samples infected with adenoviral vectors or transfected with siRNAs, this was done 48 h prior to stimulation with IL-1β. When DPI (10 μm) was used to inhibit NADPH oxidases, it was added at the time of IL-1β stimulation. Cells were washed in PBS at 20 min post-stimulation and were then fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were subsequently mounted in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole containing antifadent and were examined by fluorescent microscopy for DCF signal. Exposure times were constant for all experimental samples. Cellular H2O2 Influences IL-1β-mediated NFκB Activation—Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1β stimulation of various cell types leads to cellular ROS production (53Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Avivi C. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 54Nian M. Lee P. Khaper N. Liu P. Circ.

Toxicol. 2003; 19: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Others have also demonstrated that H2O2 influences NFκB transcriptional activation following a number of stimuli, including TNF, UV, and IL-1β (3Brigelius-Flohe R. Banning A. Kny M. Bol G.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Li Q. Sanlioglu S. Li S. Ritchie T. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, direct treatment of cells with H2O2 has the ability to activate NFκB (6Li Q. Sanlioglu S. Li S. Ritchie T. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 56Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A.

Res. 2001; 3: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, one study has also suggested that NFκB activation by IL-1β occurs in the absence of induced ROS in epithelial cells (42Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to better understand potential mechanisms by which H2O2 influences IL-1β-mediated activation of NFκB. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was chosen for these studies, because it expresses a very low level of endogenous GPx-1 (an antioxidant enzyme responsible for degrading cellular H2O2 to water) and enables efficient modulation of cellular H2O2 levels through the overexpression of recombinant human GPx-1 (6Li Q. Sanlioglu S. Li S. Ritchie T. Oberley L. Engelhardt J.F. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We first sought to confirm that IL-1β stimulation of MCF-7 cells led to an increase in cellular H2O2. Indeed, our studies demonstrated that IL-1β stimulation of MCF-7 cells enhanced H2DCFDA fluorescence, suggesting that H2O2 is elevated following IL-1β treatment (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, infection with recombinant adenovirus expressing GPx-1 (Ad.GPx-1), but not the control Ad.BglII empty vector, significantly attenuated H2DCFDA fluorescence following IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 1A). These findings confirmed that IL-1β stimulates cellular H2O2 production in MCF-7 cells and that ectopic expression of GPx-1 could successfully modulate the cellular redox environment. We next evaluated the extent to which GPx-1 expression could modulate IL-1β induction of NFκB using a NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter. Indeed, we observed that IL-1β induction of NFκB at 6 h was significantly attenuated following infection with Ad.GPx-1 virus, as compared with the infection with an empty adenoviral control vector (Ad.BglII) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, ectopic expression of GPx-1 had no effect on baseline transcriptional activity of NFκB. As a control for the ability of GPx-1 expression to modulate H2O2 induction of NFκB, we performed similar studies in MCF-7 cells transiently treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 1 h and assayed for NFκB activation at 6 h. Although GPx-1 expression inhibited direct H2O2 induction of NFκB to a greater extent than IL-1β, the level of inhibition was still incomplete (∼50%) (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that cellular H2O2 partially contributes to NFκB activation by IL-1β and that GPx-1 expression more than likely can only partially attenuate H2O2 levels in the cell. The ability of GPx-1 expression to only partially block cellular H2O2 levels is also supported by H2DCFDA exp"

To further define the Pse and bacillosamine biosynthetic pathways, we have undertaken functional characterization of UDP-α-d-GlcNAc modifying dehydratase/aminotransferase pairs, in particular the H. pylori and C. jejuni flagellar pairs HP0840/HP0366 and Cj1293/Cj1294, as well as the C. jejuni Pgl pair Cj1120c/Cj1121c using His6-tagged purified derivatives. The metabolites produced by these enzymes were identified using NMR spectroscopy at 500 and/or 600 MHz with a cryogenically cooled probe for optimal sensitivity. The metabolites of Cj1293 (PseB) and HP0840 (FlaA1) were found to be labile and could only be characterized by NMR analysis directly in aqueous reaction buffer. The Cj1293 and HP0840 enzymes exhibited C6 dehydratase as well as a newly identified C5 epimerase activity that resulted in the production of both UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-4-hexulose and UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-α-d-xylo-4-hexulose. In contrast, the Pgl dehydratase Cj1120c (PglF) was found to possess only C6 dehydratase activity generating UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-α-d-xylo-4-hexulose.

The sequencing of C. jejuni genomes revealed an unusual plethora (>8%) of glycan biosynthetic genes dedicated to surface carbohydrate biosynthesis, as well as significant diversity of glycan biosynthetic gene content among individual strains (7Karlyshev A.V. Ketley J.M. Wren B.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 377-390PubMed Google Scholar). These gene products appear to be involved in the biosynthesis of the glycoconjugate structures lipooligosaccharide and capsular polysaccharide, as well as in the biosynthesis of the novel glycans utilized by the N- and O-linked protein glycosylation systems. Each respective glycoconjugate structure is represented by a distinct and dedicated genetic locus (lipooligosaccharide Cj1131-Cj1152, capsule Cj1448c-Cj1413c, N-linked glycan Cj1119-Cj1130, O-linked glycan Cj1293-Cj1342). Although much progress has been made toward biosynthetic and structural characterization of lipooligosaccharide, capsular polysaccharide, and N-linked systems, the biochemical characterization of the O-linked system is currently less well defined (7Karlyshev A.V.

Metabolomic analysis of various O-linked glycan biosynthetic mutants revealed an accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates and loss of CMP-Pse, thus confirming a role for these gene products in the Pse biosynthetic pathway, although the precise enzymatic steps of this pathway remain ill defined (16Schirm M.

To unequivocally define the Bac and Pse biosynthetic pathways, we have undertaken functional characterization of the C. jejuni and H. pylori flagellar pairs Cj1293/Cj1294 and HP0840/HP0366, as well as the C. jejuni Pgl pair Cj1120c/Cj1121c, using His6-tagged recombinant proteins. These results convincingly demonstrate that the Pse and Bac biosynthetic pathways are discrete, incorporating unique and distinct dehydratase/aminotransferase pairs, and explain the clear phenotypic differences observed between isogenic mutants from the two pathways. DNA Techniques and Plasmid Construction—Plasmid DNA minipreparations and agarose gel purification of DNA fragments were performed using Qiagen's QIAprep spin kit and QIAquick gel extraction kit, respectively. All other recombinant DNA methods and analyses were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Vector or recombinant plasmids were transformed by electroporation into electrocompetent Top10F′ or DH10B (Invitrogen) Escherichia coli cells for cloning purposes or BL21[DE3] (Novagen, Madison, WI) E. coli cells for protein production. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify H. pylori 26695 DNA or C. jejuni 11168 DNA for subsequent cloning. A list of cloning vectors and recombinant plasmids is provided in Table 1, and pertinent oligos are provided in Table 2. PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, dNTPs at a final concentration of 200 μm, 0.2 μm of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Amplicons were ligated with pCR2.1 and the agarose-purified restriction fragments were then ligated with either pET30a or pFO4 (a pET15b (Novagen) derivative in which the EcoRI-HindIII sites have been removed and replaced by sequence encoding MGSSHHHHHH). pET30a and pFO4 recombinant plasmids were sequenced using both forward and reverse T7 primers, as well as NRC175 and NRC160, respectively. Plasmid pNRC8.1 encodes a C-terminal His6-tagged derivative of HP0840 or FlaA1; pNRC37.1 encodes an N-terminal His6-tagged derivative of HP0366; pNRC20.3 encodes a C-terminal His6-tagged derivative of Cj1293 or PseB; pNRC82.1 encodes an N-terminal His6-tagged derivative of Cj1294; pNRC40.1 encodes an N-terminal His6-tagged soluble derivative of Cj1120c or PglF (residues 130–590); and pNRC41.3 encodes an N-terminal His6-tagged derivative of Cj1121c or PglE.TABLE 1Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidDescriptionSource/ReferencepCR2.1Apr, Knr, oriColE1, lac promoter, used for TA cloningInvitrogenpET30aKnr, oriColE1, T7 promoter, used for C-terminal His6-tagged protein expressionNovagenpFO4pET15b derivative; Apr, oriColE1, T7 promoter, used for N-terminal His6-tagged protein expressionThis studypNRC8.1HP0840 Ndel-Xhol in pET30a, encodes for HP0840His6This studypNRC37.1HP0366 BamHI-EcoRI in pFO4, encodes for His6HP0366This studypNRC20.3Cj1293 Ndel-Xhol in pET30a, encodes for Cj1293His6This studypNRC82.1Cj1294 BamHI-EcoRI in pFO4, encodes for His6Cj1294This studypNRC40.1Truncated Cj1120C BamHI-EcoRI in pFO4, encodes for His6SFCj1120cThis studypNRC41.3Cj1121c BamHI-EcoRI in pFO4, encodes for His6Cj1121cThis study Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence (5′ → 3′)PurposeNRC21CATATGCCAAATCATCAAAACATGCTAGACCloning of pNRC8.1NRC22CTCGAGTAATAATTTCAACAAATCATCAGGCTCNRC60GGATCCATGAAAGAGTTTGCTTATAGCloning of pNRC37.1NRC61AAAGAATTCTCATTCTATTTTAAAACTCTCAAAAGNRC43CATATGTTTAACAAAAAAAATATCTTAATCACGGCloning of pNRC20.3NRC44CTCGAGAAAACCTTCAGTATGATTGATGATTTCNRC137GGATCCATGCTTACTTATTCTCATCAAAACATCCloning of pNRC82.1NRC138GAATTCTTATCCACAATATCCCTTTTTAACTTTTTCNRC81GGATCCATGCTTGTGGATTTTAAACCTTCCloning of pNRC40.1NRC74GAATTCTTATACACCTTCTTTATTGTGTTTAAATTCNRC75GGATCCATGAGATTTTTTCTTTCTCCTCCGCloning of pNRC41.3NRC76GAATTCTTAAGCCTTTATGCTCTTTAAGATCT7-FTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGSequencing of pET30a constructsT7-RGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGNRC175TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAATTGSequencing of pFO4 constructsNRC160GGTTATGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG Open table in a new tab His6-tagged Protein Purification—For functional characterization and for the isolation of enzyme products, each expression strain was grown in 500 ml of 2x yeast tryptone (17Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) with either kanamycin (50 μg ml–1) or ampicillin (50 μgml–1) for selection. The cultures were grown at 30 °C, induced at an OD600 of 0.6 with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested 2.75 h later. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mm imidazole and complete protease inhibitor mixture, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science). After addition of 10 μgml–1 of RNaseA and DNaseI (Roche Applied Science), the cells were disrupted by two passes through an emulsiflex C5 (20,000 psi). Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant fraction was applied to a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column equilibrated in 10 mm imidazole lysis buffer, using a flow rate of 0.5 ml min–1. After sample application, the column was washed with 20 column volumes of 10 mm imidazole Lysis buffer. To elute the protein of interest, a linear gradient from 10 to 100 mm imidazole, in lysis buffer, over 60 column volumes was applied to the column prior to a final pulse of 40 column volumes of 200 mm imidazole lysis buffer. Fractions containing the purified protein of interest, as determined by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and Coomassie staining, were pooled and dialyzed against dialysis buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using A280 0.1% values (HP0840His6, 0.536; His6HP0366, 0.386; Cj1293His6, 0.669; His6Cj1294, 0.635; His6SFCj1120c, 0.410; His6Cj1121c, 0.902). Enzymatic Reactions—Purification and dialysis/assay buffers for flagellar glycosylation enzymes were pH 7.2, whereas those for Pgl enzymes were pH 7.7. HP0840His6, Cj1293His6, and His6SFCj1120c reactions were scaled up to a total reaction volume of 20 ml containing 6 mg of enzyme in the presence of 1 mm UDP-α-d-GlcNAc. Time course samples were also taken for these dehydratase reactions at the times indicated; the samples were then boiled for 3 min, centrifuged for 3 min, and diluted 1:4 in H2O prior to capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis. For the HP0840His6/His6HP0366 and the Cj1293His6/His6Cj1294 coupled assays, the reactions were scaled up to a total volume of 30 ml containing 9 mg of each enzyme in the presence of 1 mm UDP-α-d-GlcNAc, 10 mm l-Glu, and 1 mm pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) (the latter two being cofactors necessary for the aminotransfer reaction). To prepare the His6Cj1121c product, 25 ml of a His6SFCj1120c reaction containing 7.5 mg of enzyme in the presence of 1 mm UDP-α-d-GlcNAc was allowed to proceed for 210 min. After passage through an Amicon Ultra-15 (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) filter membrane, 6.3 mg of His6Cj1121c was added to the filtrate, along with PLP and l-Glu, to a final concentration of 1 and 10 mm, respectively. After incubation at 37 °C for 210 min, all reaction mixtures were passed through filter membranes as described above. The filtrates were then either 1) lyophilized and desalted using a Bio-Gel P-2 (Bio-Rad) column in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, as well as a Sephadex G-15 column in pyridine:acetic acid:H2O (1:2.5:250) prior to NMR, or 2) analyzed directly by NMR in aqueous reaction buffer. Sample composition (i.e. distribution of products II-V, see Fig. 4) was analyzed by CE prior to NMR analysis. Analysis of Enzymatic Reaction Products by NMR Spectroscopy—Purified reaction products were suspended in 200 μl of 99% deuterated water (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories Inc.). For examination of metabolites immediately after an enzymatic reaction was completed, the sample (90% H2O/10% deuterated water) was prepared by adding 20 μl of 99% deuterated water to 180 μl of reaction mixture. All samples were placed into 3-mm NMR tubes. Standard homo- and heteronuclear-correlated two-dimensional 1H NMR, 31P NMR, 13C HSQC, 31P HSQC, HMBC, COSY, TOCSY, NOESY pulse sequences from Varian (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) were used for general assignments. Selective one-dimensional TOCSY, with a Z-filter, and NOESY experiments were used for complete residue assignment and measurement of proton-coupling constants, JH,H, and NOEs (18Brisson J.R. Sue S.C. Wu W.G. McManus G. Nghia P.T. Uhrin D. Jimenez-Barbero J. Peters T. NMR Spectroscopy of Glycoconjugates. Wiley-VCH, Weinhem, Germany2002: 59-93Crossref Google Scholar, 19Uhrin D. Brisson J.-R. Barotin J. N Portais J. C NMR in Microbiology: Theory and Applications. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymonden, UK2000: 165-190Google Scholar). The analysis of JH,H, and NOE values for various pyranose chair forms was based on the coordinates for ideal pyranose chair conformations (20Berces A. Whitfield D.M. Nukada T. Tetrahedron. 2001; 57: 477-491Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NMR experiments were performed with a Varian 600 MHz (1H) spectrometer equipped with a Varian 5-mm Z-gradient triple resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) cryogenically cooled probe (cold probe) and with a Varian Inova 500 MHz (1H) spectrometer with a Varian Z-gradient 3-mm triple resonance (1H, 13C, 31P) probe. Direct detected 31P NMR spectra were acquired using a Varian Mercury 200 MHz (1H) spectrometer with a Nalorac 5-mm four nuclei probe. NMR experiments were typically performed at 25 °C with suppression of the H2O or deuterated HOD resonance at 4.78 ppm. For proton and carbon experiments, the methyl resonance of acetone was used as an internal reference (δH 2.225 ppm and δC 31.07 ppm), and an external 85% phosphoric acid standard (δP 0 ppm) was used to reference 31P spectra. Analysis of Reaction Products by CE—CE analysis was performed using a P/ACE 5510 system (Beckman Instruments) with diode array detection. The running buffer was 25 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 9.4. The capillary was either bare silica 50 μm × 50 cm or 75 μm × 50 cm, with a detector at 50 cm. The capillary was conditioned before each run by washing with 0.2 m NaOH for 2 min, water for 2 min, and running buffer for 2 min. Samples were introduced by pressure injection for 6–10 s, and the separation was performed at 18 kV for 20 min. Peak integration was done using the Beckman P/ACE station software. Kinetic Measurements of His6Cj1294 and His6Cj1121c—The substrates for the aminotransferases, UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-4-hexulose or UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-α-d-xylo-4-hexulose, were prepared by incubating UDP-α-d-GlcNAc with Cj1293His6. This substrate preparation was used because of its versatility in studying both Pse and Bac aminotransferases. To determine the preferred substrate for His6Cj1294 and His6Cj1121c, ∼15 μg of each enzyme was incubated with this Cj1293His6 filtrate, containing 10 mm l-Glu and 1 mm PLP, and subjected to time course analysis (see above). For kinetic analyses, 5 μg of His6 Cj1294 in a total volume of 200 μl, or 0.15 μg of His6Cj1121c in a total volume of 400 μl, was incubated at 37 °C in dialysis buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm PLP, 10 mm l-Glu, and various quantities of UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-4-hexulose and UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-α-d-xylo-4-hexulose. His6Cj1121c assays also contained 40 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin as carrier protein. Substrate conversion was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of UDP (ϵ260 = 10,000). Kinetic constants were calculated using Eadie-Hofstee plots with the program GraphPad Prism 3. Protein Expression and Purification—In this study, C. jejuni protein-coding sequences were cloned from C. jejuni 11168 DNA, and H. pylori sequences were cloned from strain 26695. Sugar nucleotide-modifying dehydratases were sensitive to N-terminal modification, whereas derivatives containing His6 tags located at the C terminus exhibited greater stability and solubility compared with their N-terminal counterparts (data not shown). As such, Cj1293 and its functional homolog HP0840 from H. pylori were both constructed with C-terminal His6 tags. In contrast, the Cj1120c derivative was designed with an N-terminal His6 tag, although, as described below, this was not adjacent to the catalytic domain. This derivative is a soluble truncated version of the native Cj1120c membrane protein, encoding only residues 130–590. From sequence alignment with the short soluble family of dehydratases the Cj1120c polypeptide can be divided into three domains: an N-terminal membrane domain containing four putative transmembrane regions, residues 1–129; a linker region, residues 130–267; and a functional or catalytic domain, residues 268–590 (data not shown). To assess the function of Cj1120c under native state conditions, the linker region was retained, although a construct containing only residues 189–590 exhibited similar activity to that observed with the 130–590 construct (data not shown). In contrast to the dehydratases, the aminotransferases HP0366, Cj1294, and Cj1121c were more resistant to N-terminal modification, but soluble yields were lower compared with the dehydratases (data not shown). Overall, yields of ∼20 mg/liter starting culture were obtained for all of the proteins tested, which had near homogeneity purity (Fig. 1). Protein production levels, as well as the correlation between size estimates determined by SDS-PAGE and that predicted from sequence, confirmed the identity of each purified His6-tagged protein. CE Characterization of HP0840, Cj1293, and Cj1120c Dehydratase Products—Similar to previously published reports of HP0840 (FlaA1) and Cj1293 (derived from C. jejuni subspecies doylei ATCC 49349) (21Creuzenet C.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we found that 11168 Cj1293His6 generated two products in sequential manner by CE. After ∼30 min of incubation of Cj1293His6 with UDP-α-d-GlcNAc the predominant product was peak IV (Fig. 2A), after which a shift occurred so that at 210 min the prominent product was peak II. In contrast, over the same time course, the only UDP-α-d-GlcNAc reaction product observed with His6SFCj1120c was peak II, which gradually increased over time (Fig. 2B). This is similar to the results obtained with WbpM, also a member of the large membrane-bound family of dehydratases (23Creuzenet C. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1295-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there was a greater amount of the breakdown indicator, UDP, present in Cj1293 and HP0840 reactions compared with that observed with the Cj1120c reactions, suggesting that compound IV is less stable than the compound II (data not shown). Moreover, as seen with 49349 Cj1293, the dehydratases studied here did not require the addition of exogenous cofactor NAD(P)+, suggesting that the cofactor was already tightly bound within the enzymes and was recycled throughout catalysis. NMR Identification of the Products of Cj1120c and Cj1293/HP0840— Based on the results of one- and two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear NMR experiments, the purified product of Cj1120c (II) was unambiguously identified as UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-α-d-xylo-4-hexulose or UDP-xylo-su"
https://openalex.org/W1969826648,"The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains four members of the FtsH protease family. One of these, FtsH (slr0228), has been implicated recently in the repair of photodamaged photosystem II (PSII) complexes. We have demonstrated here, using a combination of blue native PAGE, radiolabeling, and immunoblotting, that FtsH (slr0228) is required for selective replacement of the D1 reaction center subunit in both wild type PSII complexes and in PSII subcomplexes lacking the PSII chlorophyll a-binding subunit CP43. To test whether FtsH (slr0228) has a more general role in protein quality control in vivo, we have studied the synthesis and degradation of PSII subunits in wild type and in defined insertion and missense mutants incapable of proper assembly of the PSII holoenzyme. We discovered that, when the gene encoding FtsH (slr0228) was disrupted in these strains, the overall level of assembly intermediates and unassembled PSII proteins markedly increased. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this was due to reduced rates of degradation in vivo. Importantly, analysis of epitope-tagged and green fluorescent protein-tagged strains revealed that slr0228 was present in the thylakoid and not the cytoplasmic membrane. Overall, our results show that FtsH (slr0228) plays an important role in controlling the removal of PSII subunits from the thylakoid membrane and is not restricted to selective D1 turnover.

Overall, our results show that FtsH (slr0228) plays an important role in controlling the removal of PSII subunits from the thylakoid membrane and is not restricted to selective D1 turnover. All cellular organisms possess quality control mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of unwanted proteins (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Of current interest are the processes by which damaged and unassembled proteins are removed from the thylakoid membrane, which is the location of the protein complexes involved in oxygenic photosynthetic electron transport in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts (2Adam Z. Clarke A.K. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 451-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Side reactions associated with the light reactions of photosynthesis lead to the production of a variety of potentially hazardous molecules (e.g. reactive oxygen species) that can oxidize components, such as amino acid side chains and pigment cofactors (3Asada K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 601-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). Ultimately, unless the damage is repaired, there is a net reduction in photosynthetic performance known as photoinhibition (for review see Ref. 4Prásil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Barber J. Topics in Photosynthesis. 11. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 295-348Google Scholar). As yet, the repair pathways and, more generally, the quality control processes involved in the assembly of the thylakoid membrane protein complexes and removal of aberrant proteins remain poorly understood. One component that is especially prone to photodamage is the photosystem II (PSII) 2The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIBNblue nativeRCCreaction center coreRC47reaction center containing CP47WTwild typeTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidGFPgreen fluorescent protein. complex, which is composed of over 25 membrane and peripheral proteins and is responsible for the light-driven oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone (5Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The D1 protein, together with the homologous D2 protein, binds the cofactors involved in electron transfer through the complex (6Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.N. Maglaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2872) Google Scholar). The D1 subunit is also the chief target for light-induced damage in PSII and undergoes rapid synthesis and degradation in the light to maintain PSII activity in what is termed the PSII repair cycle (4Prásil O.

Although the precise mechanism of PSII repair is unknown, recent work has emphasized the importance of FtsH proteases for D1 turnover in vivo (7Nixon P.J. Barker M. Boehm M. de Vries R. Komenda J. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356PubMed Google Scholar). This class of proteases is found throughout nature and is involved in the degradation of both soluble and membrane proteins (8Langer T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The prototypal Escherichia coli FtsH protease is a membrane-bound zinc metalloproteinase and a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) class of proteins (9Tomoyasu T. Yuki T. Morimura S. Mori H. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1344-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The active form of the protease, most probably the hexamer (10Krzywda S. Brzozowski A.M. Verma C. Karata K. Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), extracts the membrane-embedded parts of a substrate from the lipid bilayer for degradation in a hydrophilic environment (11Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 encodes four putative FtsH homologues. Two of them, encoded by slr1390 and slr1604, are required for survival of the organism (12Mann N.H. Novac N. Mullineaux C.W. Newman J. Bailey S. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of sll1463 does not result in any apparent phenotypic change (12Mann N.H. Novac N. Mullineaux C.W. Newman J. Bailey S. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas ftsH (slr0228) insertion mutants showing light-sensitive growth are impaired in PSII repair and display slower rates of D1 degradation in vivo (13Silva P.A. Thompson E. Bailey S. Kruse O. Mullineaux C.W. Robinson C. Mann N.H. Nixon P.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2152-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These data and the observation that FtsH (slr0228) co-purified with His-tagged PSII (14Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have led to a model in which FtsH (slr0228), possibly together with other FtsH homologues, is directly involved in the degradation of damaged D1 (7Nixon P.J. Barker M. Boehm M. de Vries R. Komenda J. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 347-356PubMed Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the assembly and turnover of PSII subunits in ftsH (slr0228) insertion mutants has not yet been performed. Whether FtsH (slr0228) is located in the thylakoid or cytoplasmic membrane is also unknown and is an important point to resolve, because both sets of membranes are implicated in PSII assembly and repair (14Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Jansen T. Kanervo E. Aro E.M. Maenpaa P. J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 159: 1205-1211Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast also contains a number of FtsH homologues, all nucleus-encoded (16Adam Z. Zaltsman A. Sinvany-Villalobo G. Sakamoto W. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 123: 386-390Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Of these, FtsH2 (VAR2) has been shown to be involved in D1 degradation (17Bailey S. Thompson E. Nixon P.J. Horton P. Mullineaux C.W. Robinson C. Mann N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2006-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), but other FtsH members are also likely to participate (18Sakamoto W. Tamura T. Hanba-Tomita Y. Sodmergen Murata M. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 19Yu F. Park S. Rodermel S. Plant J. 2004; 37: 864-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The possibility that FtsH proteases might have a more wide ranging role in quality control in the chloroplast has come from studies of a zinc-dependent proteolytic activity, assigned to FtsH, which is involved in the degradation of unassembled Rieske iron-sulfur protein in isolated chloroplasts (20Ostersetzer O. Adam Z. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, whether chloroplast FtsH has a role in removing unassembled proteins in planta has not yet been established. In the present paper, we have taken a mutagenesis approach to testing whether FtsH (slr0228) has a general role in removing malfunctioning membrane proteins in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in vivo. We have analyzed the effect of inactivating FtsH (slr0228) on the accumulation and degradation rates of PSII proteins in WT and in PSII mutants that are impaired to varying degrees in their ability to assemble the PSII holoenzyme. In such mutants, PSII subunits are typically inserted into the membrane in vivo, but they are usually rapidly degraded and fail to accumulate to appreciable levels (21Vermaas W.F. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 17: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Overall, our results show that FtsH (slr0228) is needed both for selective D1 turnover during PSII repair and for the removal of unassembled PSII subunits and non-functional partially assembled PSII complexes. In addition, confocal microscopy and membrane fractionation indicate that the vast majority (if not all) of the enzyme is located in thylakoids and not in the cytoplasmic membrane.

Cultures were analyzed when in exponential phase (chlorophyll concentration ∼5 μg ml-1). Mutant Construction—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was transformed as previously described (24Diner B.A. Schlodder E. Nixon P.J. Coleman W.J. Rappaport F. Lavergne J. Vermaas W.F. Chisholm D.A.

Inactivation of ftsH (slr0228) in WT and mutants ΔD1, D1-H198V, and D1-H198L was performed by transforming with plasmid constructs in which slr0228 was interrupted at a SmaI site 253-bp downstream of the initiation codon by either cmR (for WT to obtain the slr0228::cmR strain, ΔFtsH) (12Mann N.H.

However, to make the ΔCP43ΔFtsH double mutant, genomic DNA isolated from ΔFtsH was used to transform the ΔCP43 single mutant. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR. The strain Syn0228GFP containing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FtsH (slr0228) was generated by transforming a 385-bp deletion mutant lacking the 3′-346 nucleotides of ftsH (slr0228) (strain Syn0228GENT) with a plasmid construct containing the gene encoding GFP+ isolated from plasmid MUTIN-GFP+ (26Kaltwasser M.

Isolated membranes were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE consisting of a blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE, 5-14% linear gradient gel) in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE (12-20% linear gradient gel containing 7 m urea) in the second dimension (28Komenda J.

Additionally, we used antibodies raised against Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CP43, against residues 184-203 of SbtA (the Synechocystis sodium-dependent bicarbonate transporter found in the cytoplasmic membrane) (32Zhang P.

For autoradiography, the gel or the membrane with labeled proteins was exposed to x-ray film at laboratory temperature for 2-3 days.

GFP fluorescence emission was selected with an interference band-pass filter transmitting from 500 to 527 nm, and chlorophyll fluorescence emission was selected with a 665-nm long pass filter. Images were scanned over a 47 × 47-μm window, with 512 × 512 pixels and a dwell time of 3 μs/pixel. Images were averaged from 10 scans. GFP and chlorophyll fluorescence images were smoothed and merged using EZ2000 viewer software (Nikon). FtsH (slr0228) Is Required for Selective D1 Replacement in WT in Vivo—The PSII complex in Synechocystis assembles in a stepwise fashion through a number of distinct intermediates, including the PSII reaction center (comprising D1, D2, and cytochrome b559), a PSII core complex lacking CP43 (RC47), and the monomeric core complex reaction center core (RCC). The abundance of these and other assembly intermediates, plus free subunits, can be followed using two-dimensional blue native (BN)/SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (28Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). By analyzing cells pulse-labeled in the light with [S]methionine/cysteine, the relative rates of synthesis of individual subunits can be assessed. In accordance with earlier work, we found that WT accumulated the monomeric PSII RCC together with smaller amounts of RC47 and unassembled CP47 and CP43 (Fig. 1A) (28Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As reported previously (28Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), radiolabeling of the D1 protein in the RCC and RC47 complexes was higher than that of D2 and CP43 (Fig. 1B). This is consistent with the view that D1 is the main target for damage in PSII and shows the greatest rate of selective replacement or turnover. CP47 was, in contrast, labeled weakly, presumably because this subunit is recycled and damaged less frequently than the other PSII subunits. PSII biogenesis was similarly analyzed in strain ΔFtsH containing a disrupted ftsH (slr0228) gene (Fig. 1, C and D). A number of important differences compared with the WT were consistently observed (Fig. 1, A and B). First, ΔFtsH showed similar extents of D1, D2, and CP43 radiolabeling in the RCC complex (Fig. 1D). This observation suggested that RCC in the mutant was assembled predominantly from newly synthesized D1, D2, and CP43 proteins and did not involve significant levels of selective D1 turnover. Second, despite the higher level of RC47 in the mutant, as deduced from the stained gel (Fig. 1, compare A and C) and D1 blot (Fig. 1E), the D1 and D2 proteins in this complex had incorporated less radiolabel in the ΔFtsH mutant than in WT. This suggested that RC47 in ΔFtsH originates from the disassembly of older RCC complexes, whereas in WT this complex represents either an assembly intermediate or results from the rapid disassembly of newly formed RCC. As judged from the autoradiograms (Fig. 1, B and D) and D1 blot (Fig. 1E), the mutant also contained increased levels of unassembled D1 protein in its three forms: precursor D1 (pD1), a C-terminally processed intermediate that still retained part of the C-terminal extension (iD1), and mature D1 (D1). These forms of D1 have already been assigned in WT in previous work using specific antibodies (28Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 34Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Influence of FtsH (slr0228) on D1 Turnover and the Accumulation of PSII Assembly Intermediates in a CP43-deficient Strain—The results in Fig. 1 are consistent with the hypothesis that selective D1 turnover is impaired in the ΔFtsH mutant. Although reproducible, the differences in D1 radiolabeling between ΔFtsH and WT were rather small. To confirm more conclusively that selective D1 turnover was indeed impaired in the absence of FtsH (slr0228), we decided to analyze the effect of disrupting ftsH (slr0228) in a mutant that shows a much higher level of selective D1 turnover than WT. Such a mutant is ΔCP43, which lacks the psbC gene encoding the inner PSII antenna CP43 (35Rögner M. Chisholm D.A. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5387-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Strain ΔCP43 accumulates reduced amounts of PSII (10-20% of WT level) in the form of RC47 and shows intense radiolabeling of D1 in pulse-labeling experiments, suggesting a high degree of selective D1 replacement (28Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Fast turnover of D1 was confirmed by a pulse-chase experiment that showed the half-life of the D1 protein to be <20 min in ΔCP43 (Fig. 2A) compared with ∼180 min for D1 in WT cells (not shown). When the ftsH (slr0228) gene was inactivated in the ΔCP43 strain, the growth rate of the resulting double mutant ΔCP43ΔFtsH markedly decreased (Fig. 2C). As revealed by in vivo absorption spectra (not shown), the strain also accumulated 40% less chlorophyll (as estimated by the absorbance at 690 nm) and a significantly higher level of carotenoid (especially myxoxanthophyll as revealed by high pressure liquid chromatography, not shown) on a per cell basis when compared with the original ΔCP43 strain. Estimation of the level of the D1, D2, and CP47 proteins by immunoblotting showed a dramatically increased level of all three proteins as a consequence of disruption of the ftsH (slr0228) gene (Fig. 2B). Due to the high content of carotenoid, the two-dimensional pattern of PSII protein as determined by BN/SDS-PAGE was unavoidably smeary (Fig. 3, C-E). Nevertheless, this technique clearly showed that the vast majority of D1 was assembled into monomeric RC47 complexes plus a higher molecular mass complex that we attribute to dimeric RC47 (Fig. 3E). Together with the data in Fig. 2B, this means that the ΔCP43ΔFtsH strain accumulates substantially more RC47 complex than the WT. As in the ΔFtsH strain, the ΔCP43ΔFtsH strain exhibited accumulation of radioactively labeled unassembled D1 protein. However, this accumulation was higher than in ΔFtsH, in agreement with higher synthesis of the D1 protein found in ΔCP43 compared with WT. Unassembled D1 protein could also be detected on the two-dimensional immunoblot in ΔCP43ΔFtsH but not in ΔCP43 (Fig. 3E). No decline in the intensity of the D1 radiolabeling in the pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 2A) and equivalent low levels of D1 and D2 radiolabeling in RC47 on the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 3D) confirmed the dramatic inhibition of selective D1 turnover in the ΔCP43ΔFtsH strain. Together these results showed that FtsH (slr0228) participates in fast D1 turnover in vivo in the CP43-less strain and that its absence leads to higher accumulation of the RC47 complex.FIGURE 3Coomassie stain (A and C), autoradiogram (B and D), and D1 blot (E) of thylakoid membrane proteins from the CP43-less mutant ΔCP43 (A, B, and E) and the double mutant ΔCP43/ΔFtsH (C, D, and E) after separation by two-dimensional PAGE.

Recent two-dimensional protein analysis of the D1-less strain ΔD1 revealed no accumulation of PSII complexes and only the presence of unassembled CP43 and smaller amounts of CP47 and D2 (28Komenda J.

Corresponding autoradiograms confirmed the absence of PSII complexes and the ongoing synthesis of CP43, CP47, and D2 (28Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the ΔD1 strain in which the slr0228 gene was also inactivated (ΔD1/ΔFtsH) suggested increased levels of CP47 (Fig. 4A). This was confirmed by more detailed immunochemical analysis that showed significantly increased levels of CP47 and D2 upon removal of FtsH (slr0228) (Fig. 4B). Although these proteins reached WT levels, they did not form PSII subcomplexes as judged by BN-PAGE (data not shown). In contrast to D2 and CP47, the levels of CP43 and the α-subunit of cytochrome b559 were almost equal in all tested strains, suggesting that they were not a matter of control by FtsH (slr0228) (see next paragraph). Whether the levels of the other low molecular mass PSII subunits (<10 kDa) were also affected by removal FtsH (slr0228) could not be assessed because of the lack of specific antibodies. Pulse-chase experiments clearly showed that the increased level of D2 and CP47 was due to the inhibition of their degradation (Fig. 4A). In the case of CP47, a reduction in the rate of synthesis was also noticed. Surprisingly, degradation of CP43 was also largely inhibited in the absence of FtsH (slr0228), but in this case, synthesis of the protein was also markedly reduced, leading therefore to little overall effect on the accumulation of CP43, as detected by immunoblot. Importantly, removal of FtsH (slr0228) from the ΔD1 strain inhibited growth in a light-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Absence of FtsH (slr0228) Leads to Accumulation of Mutated D1 Protein with a Modified Binding Site for Reaction Center Chlorophyll—One physiological role for FtsH (slr0228) might be to remove aberrant proteins or complexes from the membrane that have incorporated an incorrect amino acid residue through, for example, mistranslation of mRNA. To test this possibility, we analyzed the effect of removing FtsH (slr0228) on the accumulation of D1 in site-directed mutants that do not normally accumulate D1. A key residue of D1 is D1-His198, which ligates chlorophyll PD1, which in turn becomes oxidized following charge separation in PSII (24Diner B.A. Schlodder E. Nixon P.J. Coleman W.J. Rappaport F. Lavergne J. Vermaas W.F. Chisholm D.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9265-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the case of mutants D1-H198L and D1-H198V, which are unable to provide an amino acid ligand to PD1, there is a drastic decrease in the cellular content of D1 and consequently also of PSII complexes (24Diner B.A. Schlodder E.

Erythropoietin (Epo) 2The abbreviations used are: Epo, erythropoietin; NESP, novel erythropoiesis-stimulating protein; EpoR, erythropoietin receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IL, interleukin. and the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) are required for the production of mature red blood cells (1Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar); recombinant Epo is commonly used to treat anemia in cases of chronic renal failure, cancer, and AIDS. Epo contains one O-linked and three N-linked carbohydrate chains, each having 2–4 branches that often end in a negatively charged sialic acid. These carbohydrate chains are not required for receptor binding in vitro or stimulation of growth of EpoR-expressing cultured cells but are required for the in vivo bioactivity of Epo to increase red blood cell mass (2Delorme E. Lorenzini T. Giffin J. Martin F. Jacobsen F. Boone T. Elliott S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9871-9876Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Heterogeneous branching of Epo N-linked carbohydrates results in Epo isoforms with different sialic acid contents up to a maximum of 14. Epo isoforms with higher sialic acid content have a lower affinity for EpoR but a longer serum half-life and are more effective for stimulating the production of red blood cells in vivo (3Egrie J.C. Browne J.K. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2001; 16: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). How Epo is cleared from the circulation and degraded in the body is not understood (4Jelkmann W. Eur. J. Haematol. 2002; 69: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, we do not know how the sialic acid content of Epo has such a large effect on its serum half-life and in vivo bioactivity. Epo, both produced endogenously or injected, can be cleared from the circulation by filtration into urine. However, only a small fraction of an injected dose of Epo is excreted intact in urine (5Flaharty K.K. Caro J. Erslev A. Whalen J.J. Morris E.M. Bjornsson T.D. Vlasses P.H. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 47: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); most of the Epo is degraded in the body, and the degradation products of Epo are excreted in urine (6Misaizu T. Matsuki S. Strickland T.W. Takeuchi M. Kobata A. Takasaki S. Blood. 1995; 86: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where and how this degradation of Epo occurs is not known, and the clearance of Epo from the circulation and degradation in vivo may occur through more than one mechanism. It is possible that extracellular proteases and enzymes could degrade or modify Epo or that Epo could be taken up through unknown mechanisms and degraded in cells that do not express EpoR. However, there is a strong correlation between the affinity of Epo or Epo analogs for the EpoR and the in vivo lifetime of the ligand. In particular, a hyperglycosylated analog of Epo, called novel erythropoiesis-stimulating protein (NESP), was engineered to contain two additional N-linked carbohydrate chains and a maximum of 22 sialic acids (7Elliott S. Lorenzini T. Asher S. Aoki K. Brankow D. Buck L. Busse L. Chang D. Fuller J. Grant J. Hernday N. Hokum M. Hu S. Knudten A. Levin N. Komorowski R. Martin F. Navarro R. Osslund T. Rogers G. Rogers N.

NESP, which is now in clinical use to treat anemia as Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), has a lower affinity for EpoR and an ∼3-fold longer serum half-life as compared with Epo (3Egrie J.C. Browne J.K.

Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2392-2395PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that a major mechanism for degradation of Epo and NESP in the body is by cells expressing the Epo receptor, initiated by binding Epo or NESP to surface EpoR, followed by internalization by endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes. In this scenario, the receptor binding and trafficking properties of Epo and NESP should explain their different rates of degradation. To enable us to specifically study trafficking and degradation of Epo and NESP by cells that express the EpoR, we used defined cell culture systems where it was possible to measure the key kinetic parameters. Fig. 1 and our model equations (see “Experimental Procedures”) show our kinetic model for cellular trafficking and degradation of Epo and NESP. We have determined all the parameters necessary to describe the cellular trafficking and degradation of Epo and NESP and use these and our model to explain at the cellular level why these ligands are degraded at different rates.

Ligand Degradation Assay—Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI with 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics, and WEHI-3B cell conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. Retroviral vector pMX-IRES-green fluorescent protein with hemagglutinin-tagged human EpoR cDNA cloned upstream of the internal ribosome entry site was a gift of Dr. S. N. Constantinescu (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium). Samples of cultures were centrifuged to pellet cells, a portion of the medium was counted directly to measure total 125I-radioactivity and an equal volume of medium was mixed with trichloroacetic acid to measure trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. Intact (trichloroacetic acid-precipitable) 125I-ligand in the medium was measured as the difference between total 125I-radioactivity and trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. To confirm that trichloroacetic acidprecipitated radioactive ligands were intact, pellets of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material were washed with acetone, resuspended in protein-gel loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein gels were dried onto filter paper and exposed to film for autoradiography. Equilibrium Binding to Cell Surface EpoR—Cells were incubated in pH 7.3 culture medium with 125I-Epo or 125I-NESP for 18 h at 4 °C. Bound and free 125I-ligand were separated by centrifuging cells through a layer of FBS. Nonspecific binding was measured in incubations with 125I-ligand plus a 200-fold excess of unlabeled Epo as competitor. KD and Bmax were determined by fitting the model for a single class of non-cooperative binding sites to data obtained over a range of ligand concentrations, using MATLAB software (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). Ligand Internalization Assay—Cells were suspended in culture medium at 37 °C. To begin the assay an excess of 125I-Epo or 125I-NESP was added to the medium. Samples were removed into prechilled tubes in an ice-water bath, where endocytosis is stopped due to the low temperature. Cells were washed with medium at 4 °C to remove free 125I-ligand, then surface-bound and internal 125I-ligand were separated by “acid-stripping” the cells. To acid-strip ligand from the cell surface, cells were suspended in 140 mm NaCl, 25 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 2.6, for 3 min, then pelleted through a layer of FBS (modified from Ref. 9Beckman D.L. Lin L.L. Quinones M.E. Longmore G.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells retained membrane integrity (measured by exclusion of trypan blue dye) in this buffer. Acid-stable radioactivity in the cell pellet is deemed to be internal ligand, and acid-labile radioactivity in the supernatant is deemed to be surface-bound ligand. Nonspecific radioactivity in internal and surface-bound fractions was measured in samples that included 200-fold excess unlabeled ligand as competitor. Direct Measurement of Surface EpoR Dissociation Rate and Net Association Rate—UT-7/Epo cells (a gift from Dr. Chang-Zheng Chen, Stanford University School of Medicine) were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 25 mm HEPES, 10% FBS, antibiotics, and 2 units/ml Epo. We obtained a qualitatively similar result for the singlecycle assay comparing UT-7/Epo cells that were grown in 2 units/ml Epo and UT-7/Epo cells that were starved of Epo. Therefore, to increase surface EpoR, and thus obtain data with a greater signal-to-background ratio, our experiments routinely used UT-7/Epo cells that had been deprived of Epo for 18 h in culture medium with FBS. Direct Dissociation Assay—UT-7/Epo cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in medium with endocytosis inhibitors (0.1% sodium azide + 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B). Then, cells were incubated another 10 min with excess 125I-Epo or 125I-NESP to allow for binding to surface EpoR. The direct dissociation assay was started by the addition of 200-fold excess unlabeled competitor ligand. At selected time points thereafter cells were rapidly separated from the assay medium by pelleting through a layer of FBS. Radioactivity in the cell pellet was counted to measure surface-bound ligand. Nonspecific binding was measured in samples with 200-fold excess competitor ligand included during the initial surface-binding step. The first-order dissociation rate constant, koff, was measured by fitting an exponential curve through triplicate data points. Direct Association Assay—UT-7/Epo cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in medium with endocytosis inhibitors then the net binding assay started when 125I-Epo or 125I-NESP was added to the cells. Cells were separated from the assay medium, and surface-bound ligand was measured as described above. Nonspecific binding was measured in samples with 200-fold excess competitor ligand added together with the 125I-ligand. The net binding rate, kobs, was determined by fitting the curve LR(t) = LRsteady-state(1 – exp((–kobs)t) to triplicate data points, where kobs = (konL0 + koff) (10Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signaling. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Single Cycle Assay—UT-7/Epo Cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in medium with endocytosis inhibitors. Then 1 nm 125I-Epo or 5 nm 125I-NESP was added, and cells were incubated another 5 min to allow for binding to surface EpoR. Nonspecific binding was measured in parallel samples that included 200-fold excess unlabeled competitor ligand during this surface-binding step. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 300 × g at room temperature and washed once with an equal volume of 37 °C medium without endocytosis inhibitors. The assay began when half of the washed cells were suspended in 37 °C medium without endocytosis inhibitors and the other half of the cells in 37 °C medium with inhibitors. Excess competitor ligand (10 nm) was in both assay media to prevent any further binding of 125I-ligand to surface EpoR after the start of the assay. Thus kon = 0 for 125I-Epo or 125I-NESP in this single cycle assay. Samples were collected into prechilled tubes in an ice-water bath. Cells were pelleted at 300 × g at 4 °C, a portion of the medium was counted directly to measure total 125I radioactivity, and an equal volume of the medium was mixed with trichloroacetic acid to measure trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I-ligand. Intact ligand in the medium was measured as the difference between total 125I radioactivity and degraded (trichloroacetic acid-soluble) 125I-ligand. Then, the cell pellet was washed once with medium at 4 °C, and surface-bound and internal cell-associated 125I-ligand were measured by the acid-stripping procedure. Kinetic Model of Cellular Trafficking and Degradation of Epo and NESP—Model equations were solved for the initial conditions of our single cycle assay with MATLAB ode23 solver, using kon = 0 and our experimentally determined values of koff and kin. A direct measurement of internal sorting steps was not possible. Instead, the rate at which intact ligand accumulated in the medium because of resecretion was modeled as the product of an overall first-order process with rate kresec. In single cycle assays, the experimental curve showing net accumulation of intact ligand in the medium is a composite of ligand dissociating directly from surface EpoR and internalized ligand being resecreted intact (see Figs. 1 and 4). The best fit value of kresec for this composite curve, given the measured values of koff and (koff + kin), was determined. There was no significant difference in the fitted values of kresec for Epo or NESP, and the average of the fitted values of Epo and NESP is kresec = 0.347 min–1 ± 0.128. To represent the sorting step, klys was set = 0.204 min–1, to make the ratio of internalized ligand sorted for resecretion, kresec/(kresec + klys), equal to the average fraction of internalized ligand that is resecreted intact (= 0.63; Table 4). In single cycle experiments degraded (trichloroacetic acid-soluble) ligand began to accumulate after 15–20 min. Then, from 20 to 60 min trichloroacetic acid-soluble ligand accumulated in the medium in a “quasilinear” (10Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signaling. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar) fashion, with half of the degraded ligand released by 35–40 min (see Fig. 4, A and B). To incorporate this observed lag, our model equations require that internalized ligand sorted for degradation at rate klys pass through a series of intermediate steps with first-order rate constants (Fig. 1). Then, after passing through these “degradation lag” steps, degraded ligand is released into the medium essentially instantaneously (kdeg = 3 min–1).TABLE 4Summary of key parameters determined in single cycle endocytosis experiments with Epo or NESPEpoNESPAverage ± S.D.Average ± S.D.koff (min-1)0.033 ± 0.0100.043 ± 0.011kin (min-1)0.060 ± 0.0040.060 ± 0.009Fraction of internalized ligand resecreted intact0.64 ± 0.100.62 ± 0.15 Open table in a new tab Degradation of Epo and NESP by Cells Is Mediated by Surface EpoR—Fig. 2 shows that degradation of Epo and NESP by cultured cells requires that they express EpoR. The IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3 (which does not express EpoR or respond to Epo) and Ba/F3 cells expressing human EpoR from a retroviral vector (Ba/F3-huEpoR) were cultured for 3 days with excess IL-3 to ensure equal cell growth and either 0.2 nm 125I-Epo or 125I-NESP. The amount of intact Epo or NESP in cultures of parental Ba/F3 cells was not decreased over 3 days, indicating that neither Epo nor NESP were degraded (Fig. 2, A and B). SDS-PAGE analysis of acid-precipitated medium revealed only 125I-proteins the size of intact Epo or NESP (Fig. 2C); Epo migrated faster during SDS-PAGE than NESP because of the smaller amount of attached carbohydrate. In contrast, the amount of intact Epo or NESP in cultures of Ba/F3-huEpoR cells decreased over time, showing that Epo and NESP were degraded by Ba/F3-huEpoR cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Epo was degraded at a faster rate than was NESP by Ba/F3-huEpoR cells; after 3 days 71% of Epo had been degraded and only 21% of NESP (Fig. 2, A and B). We obtained similar results with higher (1 nm) and lower (0.05 nm) initial ligand concentrations (data not shown). These results show that degradation of Epo and NESP by cells requires that they express EpoR. Presumably EpoR mediates degradation of Epo and NESP by binding the ligands at the cell surface, after which they are internalized and degraded in lysosomes. To test for specific surface binding, cells were incubated 18 h with labeled ligand at 4 °C, a temperature where endocytosis does not occur, so all cell-associated Epo or NESP was bound to the cell surface. Parental Ba/F3 cells incubated with 0.5 nm 125I-Epo bound only 0.14 fmol of 125I-Epo/106 cells, and this amount was unchanged when 200-fold excess unlabeled Epo was included as competitor in the incubation (Table 1). This binding is deemed nonspecific. In contrast, Ba/F3-huEpoR cells bound 3.19 fmol of 125I-Epo/106 cells, and the addition of a 200-fold excess of competitor reduced binding to 0.10 fmol of 125I-Epo/106 cells, the same amount of 125I-Epo bound to parental Ba/F3 cells in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor (Table 1). Specific 125I-Epo binding, the difference between total and nonspecifically bound 125I-Epo, was 3.09 fmol of 125I-Epo/106 cells or 1860 molecules of radiolabeled Epo/cell. In a separate experiment, an analysis of equilibrium binding at 4 °C of a range of concentrations of 125I-Epo to Ba/F3-huEpoR cells revealed ∼2400 surface Epo binding sites/cell (Bmax = 3.93 fmol/106 cells (95% confidence interval: 3.69, 4.17); KD = 0.109 nm (95% confidence interval: 0.075, 0.143)) (data not shown).TABLE 1Total and non-specific binding of 125I-Epo and 125I-NESP to Ba/F3 and Ba/F3-huEpoR cellsIncubation conditionsCell type0.5 nM 125I-Epo0.5 nM 125I-Epo + Epo competitor2 nM 125I-NESP2 nM 125I-NESP + Epo competitorTotal bound 125I-Epo, fmol/106 cells, average ± S.D.Total bound 125I-Epo, fmol/106 cells, average ± S.D.Total bound 125I-NESP, fmol/106 cells, average ± S.D.Total bound 125I-NESP, fmol/106 cells, average ± S.D.Ba/F3-huEpoR cells3.19 ± 0.090.10 ± 0.012.88 ± 0.070.43 ± 0.04Ba/F3 cells0.14 ± 0.010.13 ± 0.030.43 ± 0.090.41 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab In a similar manner we incubated Ba/F3 and Ba/F3-huEpoR cells with 2 nm 125I-NESP. The amount specifically bound was 2.45 fmol of 125I-NESP/106 cells (= 2.88 fmol/106 cells total binding–0.43 fmol/106 cells nonspecific binding) or 1475 molecules/cell (Table 1). Thus Ba/F3-huEpoR cells express ∼2000 surface EpoRs that specifically bound Epo and NESP at the cell surface. To test for internalization of Epo or NESP, cells were incubated with125I ligand at 37 °C, a temperature where endocytosis occurs; surface-bound and internal 125I ligand were measured by acid stripping (see “Experimental Procedures”), which releases surface-bound ligand. Parental Ba/F3 cells incubated with 1 nm 125I-Epo or 125I-NESP at 37 °C had only a small amount of radioactivity in surface-bound and internal fractions (∼100–400 cpm), which did not change during the assay, was not changed by addition of excess competitor, and was the same obtained with Ba/F3-huEpoR cells incubated at 37 °C with 125I ligand and excess unlabeled competitor (data not shown). Therefore, parental Ba/F3 cells showed no specific surface binding or internalization of Epo or NESP at 37 °C. In contrast, Ba/F3-huEpoR cells rapidly bound Epo or NESP at the cell surface and after a few minutes internal ligand appeared (Fig. 2, D and E). The amount of 125I-Epo specifically bound to the surface of Ba/F3-huEpoR cells reached a maximum after 5 min and was constant thereafter (Fig. 2D). After a lag of 5 min internal 125I-Epo began to increase and approached a steady level after 60 min that was greater than the amount of surface-bound Epo (Fig. 2D). Presumably these levels of surface and internal ligand represent a steady state between the internal ligand sorted for degradation and for resecretion and external ligand binding to the surface and internalization. In a similar manner, 125I-NESP first bound to surface EpoR and then was internalized by Ba/F3-huEpoR cells (Fig. 2E). In comparison to Epo, NESP had a slower net rate of surface association, and smaller amounts of NESP were bound and internalized (note different y axis scales in Fig. 2, D and E), which is a reflection of the lower affinity of NESP for surface EpoR. Together, these experiments showed that degradation of Epo or NESP by Ba/F3-huEpoR cells was mediated by surface EpoR. Furthermore, Ba/F3-huEpoR cells specifically bound Epo or NESP at the cell surface and then internalized the surface-bound ligand, whereas parental Ba/F3 cells did not specifically bind or internalize these ligands. Cellular Trafficking and Degradation of Epo and NESP—To understand why Epo was degraded faster than NESP we determined the rate constants and key parameters that describe this ligand-receptor system (Fig. 1). To make these measurements it was first necessary to distinguish between loss of surface-bound ligand due to direct dissociation from EpoR at 37 °C and loss of surface-bound ligand due to internalization. Each process decreases the amount of surface-bound 125I ligand, but moves the ligand to a different location (Fig. 1). To measure koff, ligand dissociation was measured as the loss of ligand from the cell surface at 37 °C in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors, which were used to block the internalization of ligand. Ba/F3 cells began to lose membrane integrity (as measured by loss of trypan blue dye exclusion) after ∼20 min in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors, so we searched for another cell line to measure Epo binding and trafficking rate constants. UT-7/Epo is an Epo-dependent cell line that expresses human EpoR from the endogenous gene, and endocytosis of Epo or NESP is inhibited in these cells by the combination of 0.1% sodium azide and 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B (7Elliott S.

Both 125I-Epo and 125I-NESP were degraded in cultures of UT-7/Epo cells using the assay described in Fig. 2 (data not shown). Endocytosis of Epo by UT-7/Epo cells was effectively inhibited by the combination of sodium azide and cytochalasin B, allowing us to label surface EpoR with 125I ligand at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B; Fig. 4, A and B, right panels). We measured the dissociation rate constant (koff) for Epo and NESP from cell-surface EpoR by a direct dissociation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) and independently during single cycle assays (see “Experimental Procedures”; Fig. 4C and Table 2). There was day-to-day variation in koff measured between experiments, resulting in overlapping standard deviations for Epo and NESP koff (Table 2). However, among five direct comparisons of Epo and NESP where dissociation was measured on the same day, the koff for NESP was consistently faster than for Epo, paired t test (two-tailed), t = 4.3578; p = 0.0121 (Table 2). Averaging these koff measurements with those obtained for Epo and NESP measured in separate single cycle experiments on different days, Epo koff = 0.029 ± 0.009 min–1 and NESP koff = 0.042 ± 0.012 min–1. Thus NESP dissociates from surface receptors ∼40% faster than Epo.TABLE 2Comparison of dissociation rate constants (koff) for Epo versus NESPExperimentaFor each experiment, Epo and NESP dissociation was measured on the same day, with the only variable being whether the ligand was 125I-Epo or 125I-NESP, and all samples and measurements were handled in parallel.Epo koffbLabeled Epo or NESP was bound to UT-7/Epo cells at 37 °C in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors then the loss of 125I ligand from the cell surface was measured in medium containing inhibitors and excess unlabeled Epo to prevent rebinding of 125I-ligand.

The strength and duration of MAPK activation, as well as the stimulus and cell type, distinctly affect cellular outcomes such as cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (7Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar, 8Roovers K. Assoian R.K. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Activation and inactivation of MAPKs must therefore be tightly controlled with high specificity and efficiency to achieve appropriate cellular responses. mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 c-Jun N-terminal kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases dual-specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases kinase interaction motif docking site for FXFP immediate-early gene Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein Skp2 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase wild-type glutathione S-transferase small interfering RNA whole cell extract N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal hemagglutinin ubiquitin-activating enzyme. The identification of specific docking domains in non-catalytic regions of MAPKs and their interacting proteins provides a principal mechanism for controlling signaling specificity and efficiency (9Sharrocks A.D.

Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Most MAPK-interacting proteins have a conserved domain called the kinase interaction motif (KIM) or D/δ kinase-docking domain containing a cluster of basic residues followed by an LXL site or surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids (9Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 10Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The KIM domain exhibits high affinity interactions with an acid-rich region termed the common docking domain in the C termini of all three MAPKs (11Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Differences in the amino acid sequences of these common docking and KIM domains in the MAPKs and their substrates further fine-tune docking specificities (9Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 10Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A second MAPK docking site called the docking site for ERK, FXFP (DEF) motif was originally found in the LIN-1/AOP/Elk-1/SAP-1 subfamily of ETS transcription activators (12Jacobs D. Beitel G.J. Clark S.G. Horvitz H.R. Kornfeld K. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1809-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Upon activation, phospho-ERK2 exposes a hydrophobic pocket for DEF motif interactions (14Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y.

The DEF motifs and KIM domains can function independently or additively in directing distinct MAPKs to phosphorylate transcription factors at a specific Ser or Thr residue followed by Pro ((S/T)P) (15Fantz D.A.

All mammalian MKPs identified thus far contain an N-terminal KIM domain and a phosphatase active-site HCX5R motif (5Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 6Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 10Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Among them, MKP-1/CL100/DUSP1 and MKP-3/Pyst1/DUSP6 are prototypes whose functional associations with MAPK signals have been well characterized. MKP-1 is a nuclear enzyme encoded by an immediate-early gene (IEG), and its transcription is rapidly induced in response to many of the stimuli that activate MAPKs (20Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 21Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). By contrast, MKP-3 is localized mainly in the cytosol, and its expression is not inducible by either mitogens or cellular stresses (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 23Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4319-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). MKP-3 phosphatase activity is allosterically elevated upon selective binding to ERK2 in vitro (24Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), which may explain the highly specific inactivation of ERK by MKP-3 in vivo (22Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Likewise, catalytic activation of MKP-1 is mediated via physical interactions with ERK2, JNK1, and p38α in vitro (25Slack D.N. Seternes O.M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); this also correlates with the substrate specificity of MKP-1 in vivo (21Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 25Slack D.N. Seternes O.M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 233: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, distinct MAPKs can elicit a negative feedback loop to control signaling strength and duration. MKP-1 is rapidly degraded soon after its induction by mitogens in rodent fibroblasts (27Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, 28Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Similarly, in oocytes, Xenopus CL100 (an MKP-1 homolog) is a labile protein, and sorbitol further enhances its destruction (29Sohaskey M.L. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MKP-1 is accumulated upon proteasome inhibition in rodent fibroblasts (28Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Following removal of the proteasome inhibitory stress, MKP-1 is rapidly degraded, and forced expression of the ERK signal leads to MKP-1 phosphorylation and a decrease in degradation (28Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In sorbitol-treated oocytes, forced activation of the ERK2 signal reduces the degradation rate of exogenous Xenopus CL100 via phosphorylation (29Sohaskey M.L. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the other hand, upon Pb(II) exposure or overexpression of constitutively active MKK1/2 in several mammalian cell lines, ERK activation triggers MKP-1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, indicating a positive feedback control (30Lin Y.-W. Chuang S.M. Yang J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21534-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The foregoing suggests that ERK may exhibit dual roles in controlling MKP-1 stability in distinct cellular environments. This has driven us to explore the molecular basis for ERK-directed MKP-1 ubiquitination and to establish whether such an event also occurs during serum stimulation of quiescent cells. Here, we show that the MKP-1 DEF motif is necessary for active ERK2 binding to initiate site-specific phosphorylation, serving as an essential recognition domain for the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein Skp2 (SCFSkp2) ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), a vital E3 enzyme for S phase entry and progression (31Reed S.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 32Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), leading to MKP-1 polyubiquitination and subsequent destruction via the 26 S proteasome. These results suggest that active ERK docking to the DEF motif and SCFSkp2 association are rate-limiting for the ubiquitin-mediated MKP-1 proteolysis that would sustain ERK signaling to facilitate G1 cells entering the cell cycle. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The plasmid pSG5-MKP-1-Myc was kindly provided by Dr. N. K. Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Forward and reverse primers containing EcoRV and HindIII restriction sites were used to amplify MKP-1 cDNA from pSG5-MKP-1-Myc by PCR. This fragment was subcloned in pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate a FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) MKP-1 expression vector. Similarly, the plasmids expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged WT (GST-MKP-1) and N-terminally truncated (amino acids 1–59; GST-ΔN-MKP-1) MKP-1 cDNAs were constructed by subcloning a PCR-amplified BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pSG5-MKP-1-Myc in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Various MKP-1 and ΔN-MKP-1 substitution mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All PCR-amplified fragments or mutagenized constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the BigDye terminator cycle reaction kit and an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Production of Recombinant Proteins—The vectors encoding GST-tagged WT MKP-1 and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The GST fusion proteins were purified via binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), followed by elution in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 15 mm glutathione, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. In Vitro Binding and Phosphorylation—Equal amounts (0.2 μg) of unactive and active forms of GST-ERK2 fusion proteins (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were reacted overnight with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. Various GST-ΔN-MKP-1 fusion proteins (2 μg) were treated with thrombin (0.04 units) to release GST fragments and allowed to interact with bead-attached GST-ERK2 fusion proteins at4 °C for 3 h in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Similarly, unactive and active forms of ERK2 were reacted with bead-attached GST-ΔN-MKP-1 mutants. Following three washes with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol, the associated proteins were released by boiling the beads for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. Bead-attached GST-tagged active ERK2 was also reacted with various ΔN-MKP-1 mutants and 20 mm ATP in the presence or absence of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in a total volume of 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4,and 1 mm NaF). Next, the reaction mixture was boiled, and the phosphorylated protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by either autoradiography or Western blotting using anti-phospho-Ser296 MKP-1 antibody. The amount of GST-tagged active ERK2 in the reaction mixture was determined by Western blotting. Cells, Vectors, Small Interfering RNA (siRNA), and Transfection—The human embryonic kidney cell line H293 was cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (30Lin Y.-W. Chuang S.M. Yang J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21534-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Vectors expressing MKK1-CA (a constitutively active form of MKK1, ΔN3/S218E/S222D) and MKK2-CA (a constitutively active form of MKK2, ΔN4/S222E/S226D) were gifts from Dr. N. G. Ahn (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). pcDNA-FLAG-Skp2 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Pagano (New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY). The sense strand sequences of siRNA duplexes used for Skp2 and lamin (as a control) were 5′-AAUCUAAGCCUGGAAGGCCUGdTdT-3′ and 5′-CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACAdTdT-3′ (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO). The expression vectors were transfected into H293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The siRNA duplexes (200 nm) were transferred into cells immediately before and 24 h after vector transfection using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The transfected vectors were allowed 2 days of expression in the presence or absence of siRNAs, and the whole cell extract (WCE) was subjected to immunoprecipitation and/or Western blotting. To reveal ubiquitinated proteins, 10 μm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN; Calbiochem-Novabiochem), an inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, was supplied for the final 3 h during transfection. Serum Stimulation—Cells were cultured in medium containing 0.1% serum for 24 or 48 h and then treated with 10–20% serum for 15 min to 3 h. To prevent de novo protein synthesis, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to cells during serum stimulation. To reveal phosphorylated and ubiquitinated MKP-1, 10 μm ALLN was supplied for the final 10 min or 1 h during serum stimulation. To determine the effect of ERK activation on MKP-1 degradation, U0126 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem), a specific MKK1/2 inhibitor, was added 1 h before serum stimulation. Protein Stability Analysis—The half-lives of endogenous and exogenous MKP-1 proteins were determined using pulse-chase experiments. Serum-starved cells were cultured in methionine-free medium for 30 min and then pulse-labeled with 5 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 1 h in the presence or absence of U0126 (5 μm). Immediately after labeling, the cells were washed with a chasing medium containing 30 μg/ml methionine prior to stimulation with 10% serum in the chasing medium for 0–3 h. Cells were then lysed, and MKP-1 proteins in the WCE were subjected to immunoprecipitation and subsequent electrophoresis. Isotope-labeled MKP-1 was visualized by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—WCE collection was performed as described previously (33Lin Y.-W. Chuang S.M. Yang J.-L. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) was employed to determine protein concentrations using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of proteins in the WCE were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were then transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with primary antibody, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (catalog no. 9101; Beverly, MA). The polyclonal antibodies against ERK2 (C-14), MKP-1 (V-15), ubiquitin (P4D1), Skp2 (H-435), hemagglutinin (HA; F-7), Skp1 (H-163), Cul1 (H-213), Cks1 (FL-79), p27 (C-19), and α-tubulin (TU-02) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was from Sigma. The anti-phospho-Ser296 MKP-1 antibody was generated from rabbits injected with phosphopeptide KQRRSIIpSPNFSFMG conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies were stripped from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a solution containing 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 0.7% (w/w) β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 15 min before reprobing with another primary antibody. Relative protein blot intensities were determined using a computing densitometer equipped with the ImageQuant analysis program (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer as described previously (30Lin Y.-W. Chuang S.M. Yang J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21534-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against ubiquitin, FLAG, Skp2, ERK2, MKP-1, and phospho-Ser296 MKP-1 and collected with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 16 h. The immunoprecipitate was then washed three times with cold lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting. In Vitro Ubiquitination—The SCFSkp2-Cks1 E3 complex was prepared as follows. The FLAG-Skp2 vector was transfected into H293 cells and allowed expression for 2 days, and the WCE was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody. The FLAG-Skp2 immunocomplex was then mixed with equal amounts of the Cks1 immunocomplex prepared separately from H293 cells. Following the phosphorylation reaction, WT MKP-1 and mutants (5 μg) were subjected to in vitro ubiquitination assay using ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1; 0.5 μg; AFFINITI Research Products Ltd., Plymouth Meeting, PA), UbcH3 conjugating enzyme (1 μg; AFFINITI), SCFSkp2-Cks1 immunocomplex, and ubiquitin (50 μg; AFFINITI) in a reaction buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. The ubiquitination reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min, and the ubiquitinated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-MKP-1 antibody. The MKP-1 DEF Motif Is Essential for Active ERK Binding and Phosphorylation, Leading to Ubiquitination and Proteolysis—ERK can induce mkp-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level (34Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and enhance phosphatase activity via docking to the N-terminal KIM domain of MKP-1 (25Slack D.N. Seternes O.M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suggesting a negative feedback loop to inhibit the kinase activity. By contrast, ERK can also trigger MKP-1 proteolysis, reflecting a positive feedback loop to sustain the kinase activity (30Lin Y.-W. Chuang S.M. Yang J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21534-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Given that MKP-1 contains one putative DEF motif (FNFP, residues 339–342) in the C terminus for ERK docking (Fig. 1), we explored whether this motif is essential for ERK-triggered proteolysis. To avoid the possibility of the KIM domain competing with the DEF motif for ERK docking, we constructed the GST-tagged ΔN-MKP-1 mutant, in which the N-terminal 1–59 residues were truncated, and its derivative ΔN-MKP-1(ANAP), in which the two Phe residues in the DEF motif (FNFP) were mutated to Ala. The ΔN-MKP-1 and ΔN-MKP-1(ANAP) fusion proteins were expressed in and purified from bacteria, followed by in vitro incubation with either unactive or active ERK2. Fig. 2A shows that ΔN-MKP-1 formed a complex with active ERK2, but ΔN-MKP-1(ANAP) did not; conversely, neither ΔN-MKP-1 nor ΔN-MKP-1(ANAP) associated with unactive ERK2. Furthermore, active ERK2 could phosphorylate ΔN-MKP-1 but not ΔN-MKP-1(ANAP) (Fig. 2B). These in vitro results suggest that the MKP-1 DEF motif is essential for active ERK2 docking and phosphorylation.FIGURE 2Mutated DEF motif in MKP-1 impairs active ERK2 docking and phosphorylation in vitro. A, glutathione-Sepharose bead-attached GST-ERK2 unactive or active) was mixed with ΔN-MKP-1 (+) or ΔN-MKP-1(ANAP) (upper panels). Alternatively, bead-attached GST-ΔN-MKP-1 or GST-ΔN-MKP-1(ANAP) was mixed with unactive or active ERK2 (lower panels). The mixtures were kept at 4 °C for 3 h, and protein binding was resolved by GST pull-down and subsequent Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. Equal amounts of proteins used for the pull-down assay were also analyzed by Western blotting (indicated as loading). B, bead-attached GST-tagged active ERK2 was reacted with ΔN-MKP-1 (+) or ΔN-MKP-1(ANAP) in the presence of 20 μm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were then analyzed by electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography (indicated as Kinase assay). A portion of the bead-attached GST-tagged active ERK2 was analyzed by Western blotting to determine equal input. Kinase assay results were calculated by averaging four independent experiments. The Western blots shown are representative of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore whether the DEF motif plays a crucial role in MKP-1 ubiquitination stimulated by ERK in vivo, we cotransfected FLAG-MKP-1 or FLAG-ΔN-MKP-1 with HA-MKK1-CA into H293 cells, allowed expression for 2 days, and treated one set of cells with an inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome (10 μm ALLN) for the final 3 h to reveal protein ubiquitination. The second set of cells was not treated with ALLN to determine protein degradation. As with FLAG-MKP-1, FLAG-ΔN-MKP-1 was polyubiquitinated and degraded during forced expression of MKK1-CA in H293 cells (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 7–10), suggesting that the MKP-1 KIM domain is dispensable for ERK-directed ubiquitination in vivo. We next constructed a FLAG-tagged full-length MKP-1(ANAP) mutant to evaluate the physiological role of the DEF motif in ERK activation. Forced expression of MKK1-CA in H293 cells caused polyubiquitination in FLAG-MKP-1 but not in the ANAP mutant (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 5 and 6). MKK1-ERK signaling also markedly enhanced a decrease in the FLAG-MKP-1 protein level (Fig. 3B, first row, compare lanes 3 and 5), which was notably higher than that in the ANAP mutant level (Fig. 3, B, compare lanes 4 and 6; and C, left panel). These results suggest that the DEF motif is involved in ERK-directed MKP-1 degradation in vivo via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Additionally, the relative phospho-ERK levels stimulated by MKK1-CA were lower in cells coexpressing either FLAG-MKP-1 or the ANAP mutant compared with those coexpressing pcDNA3 (Fig. 3, B, second row, compare lane 2 with lanes 5 and 6; and C, right panel). Identification of ERK-directed Phosphoacceptor Sites in MKP-1 for Proteolysis via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—Previous studies have indicated that binding of ERK to the DEF motifs of several substrates, including the Elk-1, SAP-1, and c-Fos transcription factors and the IEX-1 early response gene product, results in phosphorylation of specific (S/T) P sites positioned at DEF motif N termini and subsequent functional activation (15Fantz D.A.

We have recently reported that eNOS is constitutively S-nitrosylated in endothelial cells and that agonists promote eNOS denitrosylation concomitant with enzyme activation (Erwin, P. A., Lin, A. J., Golan, D. E., and Michel, T. (2005), J. Biol. Chem. 280, 19888–19894). In the present studies, we use mass spectrometry to confirm that the zinc-tetrathiolate cysteines of eNOS are S-nitrosylated. eNOS targeting to the plasma membrane is necessary for enzyme S-nitrosylation, and we report that translocation between cellular compartments is necessary for dynamic eNOS S-nitrosylation. We transfected cells with cDNA encoding wild-type eNOS, which is membrane-targeted, or with acylation-deficient mutant eNOS (Myr–), which is expressed solely in the cytosol. While wild-type eNOS is robustly S-nitrosylated, we found that S-nitrosylation of the Myr– eNOS mutant is nearly abolished. When we transfected cells with a fusion protein in which Myr– eNOS is ligated to the CD8-transmembrane domain (CD8-Myr–), we found that CD8-Myr– eNOS, which does not undergo dynamic subcellular translocation, is hypernitrosylated relative to wild-type eNOS. Furthermore, we found that when endothelial cells transfected with wild-type or CD8-Myr– eNOS are stimulated with eNOS agonist, only wild-type eNOS is denitrosylated; CD8-Myr– eNOS S-nitrosylation is unchanged. These findings indicate that subcellular targeting is a critical determinant of eNOS S-nitrosylation. Finally, we show that eNOS S-nitrosylation can be detected in intact arterial preparations from mouse and that eNOS S-nitrosylation is a dynamic agonist-modulated process in intact blood vessels. These studies suggest that receptor-regulated eNOS S-nitrosylation may represent an important determinant of NO-dependent signaling in the vascular wall.

Welch G. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1995; 38: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). A constitutive enzyme, eNOS is robustly expressed by vascular endothelial cells and undergoes dynamic subcellular targeting that affects eNOS activity by differentially exposing the enzyme to diverse regulatory interactions, including enzyme inhibition by caveolin or activation by different kinases and phosphatases (2Feron O.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In resting cells, eNOS is targeted to caveolae by reversible thiopalmitoylation of eNOS Cys15 and Cys26, modifications that are dependent on the prior co-translational and irreversible N-myristoylation of eNOS Gly2 (4Shaul P.W.

Upon agonist stimulation, eNOS is rapidly depalmitoylated and translocates from peripheral membrane caveolae to internal membrane structures; over time, the enzyme is retargeted to caveolae and repalmitoylated as eNOS returns to basal activity levels (2Feron O.

We have previously reported that S-nitrosylation reversibly inhibits eNOS activity, that eNOS is tonically S-nitrosylated in vascular endothelial cells, and that the enzyme undergoes rapid, transient denitrosylation upon agonist stimulation, followed by progressive renitrosylation as the enzyme returns to resting activity levels (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We also showed that endogenous eNOS S-nitrosylation in transfected cells is abolished when the zinc-tetrathiolate cysteines (residues 96 and 101 in the bovine eNOS sequence) of eNOS are changed to serine by PCR-directed mutagenesis (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We used mass spectrometry to analyze the S-nitrosylation pattern of purified recombinant eNOS and showed directly that the zinc-tetrathiolate of eNOS is preferentially S-nitrosylated in the intact enzyme. We also report that subcellular targeting is a determinant of eNOS S-nitrosylation and that translocation between cellular compartments is necessary for agonist-modulated eNOS denitrosylation. Finally, we extended our work from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) to show that dynamic S-nitrosylation occurs in intact mouse blood vessels. Taken together, these data suggest that S-nitrosylation is a dynamic and physiologically relevant regulator of NO signaling pathways in the vascular endothelium. endothelial nitric-oxide synthase hemagglutinin N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide horseradish peroxidase vascular endothelial growth factor (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenium-1,2-diolate methyl methanethiosulfonate matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry collision-induced dissociation bovine aortic endothelial cells Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium analysis of variance.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant eNOS—Plasmid pCW-eNOS, encoding the cDNA of bovine eNOS (8Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, was obtained from Paul Ortiz de Montellano (University of California at San Francisco) (9Nishida C.R. de Montellano P.R.O J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). pCW-eNOS was transformed into competent BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells under selection with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A starter culture (30 ml) was grown overnight and used to inoculate 6 × 1-liter flasks of terrific broth. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8. The temperature was then lowered to 22 °C and recombinant eNOS expression was induced with 1.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until purification. Cell pellets were resuspended in 4 °C lysis buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (Roche Applied Science), pH 8.0. The resuspended cells were lysed by sonication and further disrupted using an EmulsiFlex-C5 high-pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) at 4 °C. Centrifugation for 1 h at 42,000 rpm yielded supernatant that was immediately gravity-loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen). After loading, the column was washed with 20 volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), followed by 10 volumes of elution buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0). Fractions containing full-length eNOS (∼135 kDa), as determined by Coomassie-staining of samples separated by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated using 50-kDa molecular weight cut-off Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). eNOS was further purified using a Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 500 μm l-arginine, 10 μm (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4. Fractions containing homogeneous full-length eNOS were pooled, concentrated, and stored at –80 °C. Deviation from these conditions or failure to keep eNOS at 4 °C or lower throughout the purification resulted in extensive proteolysis. Protein concentrations were assessed using the Bradford method (bovine serum albumin standard); the eNOS protein yield typically was 4 mg/liter. Biotin Switch Method for Purified Recombinant eNOS—The biotin switch method was performed as described previously (10Mitchell D.A. Erwin P.A. Michel T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4636-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), with minor modifications outlined below. Initial protein concentration was 0.5 μg/μl, and reactions were performed in 125 μl total volume. For the first step of the assay, metal chelators were omitted to avoid disrupting the zinc-tetrathiolate cluster in eNOS. The buffer for the rest of the assay was 100 mm HEPES, 400 μm EDTA, and 40 μm neocuproine, pH 7.5. The presence of EDTA and neocuproine ensured that metal-catalyzed S-nitrosothiol decomposition would be minimized. Purified proteins were S-nitrosylated in vitro using the NO-donor diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenium-1,2-diolate (DEA/NO, 50 μm). The blocking step was performed at 55 °C, in the presence of 30 mm methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) with frequent vortexing. Samples were then biotinylated, separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (10–20% Tris-glycine) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight in 3% bovine serum albumin and probed in Western blots with NeutrAvidin-HRP. The Western blots were developed using Super Signal West Femto chemiluminescence reagent and the biotinylation signal for S-nitrosylation visualized on a Fluor-S Multimager (Bio-Rad). Proteolytic Digests and MALDI-MS Analysis of Peptide Fragments—Purified recombinant eNOS (∼15 μg) processed by the biotin switch method was diluted to a total volume of 35 μlin 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, and 5% v/v n-propyl alcohol. Omission of n-propyl alcohol from the digest reaction or starting with incompletely denatured eNOS both resulted in extremely poor proteolysis. Digestions were initiated with the addition of 180 ng of Trypsin Gold (Promega, Madison, WI) and incubated for 12 h at 22 °C. Samples for MALDI-MS were desalted using C-18 ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and were eluted with 6 μl of a 60% acetonitrile, 39.9% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The matrix/peptide solution (1 μl) was then spotted onto the MALDI target. Spectra were acquired in reflector mode over the range m/z 600–5000 Da using an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Foster City, CA). To acquire collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra, a single time-of-flight spectrum was first recorded on an Applied Biosystems 4700 MALDI tandem time-of-flight instrument in reflector mode over the range m/z 600–4500 Da. The protonated peptide ions at m/z 1003.4 and 1385.7 Da were then isolated in MS1 and individual CID spectra acquired. Air was used as the collision gas at 1.0 keV (laboratory frame) collision energy. Cell Culture and Drug Treatment—BAEC were obtained from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in culture on gelatin-coated 100-mm culture dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) and penicillin-streptomycin (2%). Experiments were performed with BAEC between passages 5 and 8; cultures were serum-starved overnight before experiments, and drug treatments of BAEC were performed as described (11Igarashi J. Erwin P.A. Dantas A.P.V Chen H. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10664-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained on uncoated culture dishes in the same medium as BAEC (12Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32363-32370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For stimulation with A23187, transfected COS-7 cells were equilibrated in Hanks' balanced salt solution with Ca2+ (1.26 mm) for 20 min at 37 °C. A23187 prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was then added (final A23187 concentration of 10 μm), and the cells were incubated for a further 5 min at 37 °C. Me2SO alone (final concentration 0.1%) was added to the control samples. Plasmid Transfection—The plasmid pkENH encoding HA epitope-tagged wild-type bovine eNOS cDNA and its parent plasmid pBKCMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) have been described previously (5Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the N-myristoylation-deficient eNOS mutant (Myr–) and the fusion protein in which Myr– is ligated to the CD8-transmembrane domain have been characterized in detail previously (3Gonzalez E. Kou R. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BAEC and COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Preparation of Cellular Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Biotin Switch Method for Detection of S-Nitrosylated eNOS—100-mm dishes of cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into 1 ml of lysis buffer comprised of Tris (20 mm, pH 7.4), Nonidet P-40 (1% v/v), deoxycholate (2.5% w/v), NaCl (150 mm), Na3VO4 (2 mm), EDTA (1 mm), NaF (1 mm), and neocuproine (100 μm), supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors, as described previously (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After vigorous vortexing, cellular lysates were sonicated on ice (Branson Ultrasonic, Danbury, CT) at 30% of nominal converter amplitude for 3 × 10 s bursts. Lysates were then rocked at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. eNOS was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells by incubating supernatants with anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody or from BAEC with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. All antibody incubations were rocked for 1–16 h at 4 °C. After addition of Protein A-agarose beads and another hour of rocking at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively with ice-cold lysis buffer. eNOS was then eluted by rocking the beads with “Blocking Buffer” (14Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: PL1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 25 min at room temperature before proceeding with blocking and biotinylation steps of the biotin switch method, essentially as described (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: PL1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the biotinylation step, labeled eNOS was purified with streptavidin-agarose, eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot against eNOS, as described (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Low light conditions were used until completion of the biotinylation step. Analyses in Intact Blood Vessels—Mice were sacrificed with a lethal dose of Nembutol and the thoracic aortae promptly harvested following thoracotomy. Whole mouse aortae were immediately placed into ice-cold homogenizing buffer comprised of Tris (10 mm, pH 7.4), Triton X-100 (1% v/v), deoxycholate (0.5% w/v), SDS (0.1% v/v), NaCl (150 mm), Na3VO4 (2 mm), NaF (1 mm), and neocuproine (100 μm), supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. After freezing on dry ice, samples were homogenized with a PowerGen 125 homogenizer (Fisher). Homogenate solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min and rocked for 30 min 4 °C. After another 30 min of centrifugation at 14,000 × g, the supernatants were incubated with anti-eNOS antibody for 1–16 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Protein A-agarose beads for 1 h. eNOS was eluted from the beads into Blocking Buffer, processed by the biotin switch method, and separated by SDS-PAGE essentially as described above for eNOS prepared from BAEC above (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: PL1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For VEGF treatments, freshly isolated aortae were first equilibrated in DMEM for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The medium was then exchanged for an equal volume of DMEM containing VEGF or its vehicle. After incubating in the new medium for 5 min at 37 °C, vessels were washed with DMEM and frozen in buffer for homogenization, eNOS immunoprecipitation, and processing by the biotin switch method, as described above. Reduction of eNOS S-Nitrosothiols with HgCl2—Following eNOS immunoprecipitation with anti-eNOS antibody and Protein A-agarose, eNOS was eluted by rocking the beads for 25 min at room temperature in a solution comprised of HgCl2 (3 mm), HEPES (250 mm, pH 7.7), neocuproine (100 μm), and SDS (2.5%). The same solution without HgCl2 was used for the control sample. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant reacted at 40 °C for 30 min with shaking and frequent vortexing. eNOS was precipitated with 1 volume of –20 °C acetone, incubated at –80 °C for 15 min, rocked at 4 °C for 20 min, and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in Blocking Buffer and processed by the biotin switch method, as described (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies as described, except that Western blots of mouse eNOS were probed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-eNOS antibody (11Igarashi J. Erwin P.A. Dantas A.P.V Chen H. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10664-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were probed for β-actin according to the manufacture's protocol. Immunoblots were stripped for re-blotting with ReBlot Antibody Stripping Solution from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Densitometric analyses of autoradiographs were performed using a ChemiImager 400 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Other Methods—Mean values for individual experiments are plotted ± S.E. Data plotting and statistical analyses (ANOVA) were performed using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MALDI Mass Spectrometric Analysis of S-Nitrosylated eNOS—We used the “biotin switch” method to selectively and quantitatively label the S-nitrosylated cysteine(s) of eNOS for identification by mass spectrometry (15Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). In the biotin switch method, unmodified cysteine sulfhydryls of a protein are first reacted with MMTS, protecting them from biotinylation in the subsequent labeling steps and thereby preventing false-positive signals (14Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: PL1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, any cysteine S-nitrosothiols are reduced with ascorbate and reacted with a biotin-HPDP label (14Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: PL1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our first step was to use the biotin switch method to analyze S-nitrosylation of purified recombinant eNOS incubated with the NO-donor DEA/NO (50 μm). After processing by the biotin switch method, eNOS was subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Probing the membranes with NeutrAvidin-HRP revealed a robust increase in the S-nitrosylation signal of purified recombinant eNOS treated with DEA/NO (data not shown). When we trypsinized DEA/NO-treated eNOS and analyzed the tryptic peptides by MALDI-MS, we detected peaks at 1003.4 and 1385.7 Da, which correspond to the peptide 101CLGSLVLPR109 modified at Cys101 by MMTS and biotin-HPDP, respectively (Fig. 1). This peptide contains a nontryptic N terminus and a tryptic C terminus. Please note that in Figs. 1 and 2, because of the N-terminal His6-tag on the recombinant eNOS, the numbering of residues reflects the addition of these additional 6 histidine residues at the N terminus; thus Cys107 shown in the figure is equivalent to Cys101 in the bovine eNOS sequence. CID spectra derived from the 1003.4- and 1385.7-Da peptides (Fig. 2) confirm biotinylation of the C-terminal cysteine of zinc-tetrathiolate of eNOS, i.e. that Cys101 is S-nitrosylated. Despite extensive efforts using different proteases, matrices, and spotting techniques, we were unable to detect any peptide containing the free, MMTS- or biotin-adducted N-terminal cysteine of eNOS's zinc-tetrathiolate (Cys96), a residue that we previously identified using site-directed mutagenesis as a site that undergoes S-nitrosylation (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Collision-induced dissociation spectra. Shown are collision-induced dissociation spectra confirming modification of Cys107 by MMTS (A) and biotin-HPDP (B). For A, the CID spectrum of this peptide contains most of the y+ and b+ series of ions, an internal amino acid fragment, and peaks corresponding to C-S dissociation of the methyl disulfide. This spectrum confirms the identity of the peptide as the methyl disulfide of CLGSLVLPR. The same disulfide fragmentation pattern (dissociation at C-S) was also observed for b4 and b6. B confirms that the C-terminal zinc-tetrathiolate cysteine is the site of biotinylation, indicating that an S-nitrosothiol was formed on this amino acid (shown as Cys107 in this figure analyzing recombinant eNOS with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag; this residue corresponds to Cys101 in the native bovine eNOS). The CID spectrum of this peptide contains most of the y+ and b+ series of ions, two internal amino acid fragments, and peaks corresponding to C-S and S-S dissociation of the disulfide-linked biotin. This spectrum confirms the identity of the peptide as S-biotinylated CLGSLVLPR. The abbreviations used in this figure include: M, molecular ion; M-SS-(biotin), molecular ion minus biotin with the sulfur atom of biotin-HPDP retained (C-S fragmentation); M-(SS-CH3), molecular ion minus MMTS with the sulfur atom of cysteine released; M-biotin, molecular ion minus biotin (S-S fragmentation); M-(SS-biotin), molecular ion minus biotin with the cysteine sulfur atom released (C-S fragmentation). The biotin tags released from these three dissociation events were also observed: biotin-(SS), biotin, and biotin-SS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) eNOS Subcellular Targeting and S-Nitrosylation—We have previously reported that an acylation-deficient eNOS mutant (Myr–), which is expressed solely in the cellular cytosol, is not S-nitrosylated (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19888-19894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because eNOS subcellular targeting is a determinant of eNOS's phosphorylation pattern (3Gonzalez E. Kou R. Lin A.J. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39554-39560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we proposed that eNOS S-nitrosylation may also influenced by subcellular targeting. To further explore this hypothesis, we transfected COS-7 cells with cDNA encoding recombinant wild-type eNOS, which reversibly transits between plasmalemmal caveolae and internal membranes; Myr– eNOS, which is expressed solely in the cellular cytosol; or with a fusion protein in which Myr– eNOS is ligated to the transmembrane domain of the cell surface glycoprotein CD8 (CD8-Myr–) (3Gonzalez E.

We have previously shown that while the CD8-Myr– eNOS fusion protein is irreversibly targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae, this construct remains enzymatically active and can be stimulated by eNOS agonists (16Kantor D.B.

By contrast, S-nitrosylation of the cytosolic Myr– eNOS mutant in transfected COS-7 cells is almost undetectable (15 ± 11% of wild-type signal, n = 3, p < 0.05) (7Erwin P.A. Lin A.J. Golan D.E.

Finally, the S-nitrosylation signal for the immunoprecipitated CD8-Myr– fusion protein is greater than that of wild-type eNOS (435 ± 150% of wild-type signal, n = 3, p < 0.05; Fig. 3).

Here, we demonstrate that UV-induced caspase cleavage of the human desmoglein 1 cytoplasmic tail results in distinct 17- and 140- kDa products, whereas metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of the extracellular adhesion domain generates a 75-kDa product. In vitro studies identify caspase-3 as the preferred enzyme that cleaves desmoglein 1 within its unique repeating unit domain at aspartic acid 888, part of a consensus sequence not conserved among the other desmosomal cadherins. Apoptotic processing leads to decreased cell surface expression of desmoglein 1 and re-localization of its C terminus diffusely throughout the cytoplasm over a time course comparable with the processing of other desmosomal proteins and cytoplasmic keratins. Importantly, whereas classic cadherins have been reported to promote cell survival, short hairpin RNA-mediated suppression of desmoglein 1 in differentiated keratinocytes protected cells from UV-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our results identify desmoglein 1 as a novel caspase and metalloproteinase substrate whose cleavage likely contributes to the dismantling of desmosomes during keratinocyte apoptosis and also reveal desmoglein 1 as a previously unrecognized regulator of apoptosis in keratinocytes.

Apoptosis is an active, orderly process of programmed cell death that eliminates superfluous, damaged or destructive cells and is critical to the normal development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis in multi-cellular organisms (21Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). The process of apoptosis is mediated by caspases, a special family of cysteine proteases that is largely responsible for producing a series of well defined morphological and biochemical changes in apoptotic cells including loss of cell contact and rounding of the cell body, loss of cytoskeletal integrity, and nuclear condensation (22Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). Caspases involved in the cell death pathway are characterized either as upstream initiators of the apoptotic proteolytic cascade (such as caspase-8) or as downstream effectors (such as caspase-3) and mediate cell death by selectively cleaving critical target molecules at aspartic acid residues within specific recognition sites (for review, see Ref. 23Cryns V.

Targeting of these junction-associated molecules for cleavage during apoptosis is thought to mediate the orderly dissolution of cell structure and morphology that typifies apoptotic cell death. As yet, the differentiation-specific desmosomal cadherin, Dsg1, and its partner, Dsc1, have not been investigated as potential caspase targets. In the work presented here, using an in vitro screen for desmosomal protein caspase targets, we show that Dsg1 is cleaved by caspase-3 at a unique site in the RUD domain that is not conserved in other Dsg isoforms. In keratinocytes stimulated to undergo apoptosis, caspase- and metalloproteinase-dependent Dsg1 processing is temporally coordinated with the proteolysis of other desmosomal proteins, resulting in a loss of Dsg1 cell surface localization concomitant with the disruption of cell-cell junctions. Finally, we show that shRNA-mediated suppression of Dsg1 expression in differentiating keratinocytes protects them from UV-induced apoptosis, suggesting a potentially novel function for Dsg1 in facilitating apoptotic elimination of damaged cells. Generation of cDNA Constructs—A construct encoding the cytoplasmic tail of human Dsg1 with a C-terminal Myc tag (p288) was utilized for in vitro cleavage assays. This construct includes a 5′-BamHI/HincII fragment ™ with the signal sequence (nucleotides 24-276; see Gen-Bank accession number AF097935) attached to the Dsg1 membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic domains (nucleotides 1740-3360). A construct encoding full-length, tagged Dsg1 in pBluescript KS (Stratagene) (p281) (3Kowalcyzk A.P. Palka H.L. Luu H.H. Nilles L.A. Anderson J.E. Wheelock M.J. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31214-31223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a PCR template to add a Myc tag, stop sequence, and HindIII site onto the end of the Dsg1 sequence. The p288 construct was generated by digesting p281 with HincII/HindIII and replacing the resulting fragment with the PCR product at the ScaI/HindIII sites. A construct encoding a mutant Dsg1 cytoplasmic tail that is missing the obligate aspartic acid residue in the P1 position of the caspase-3 consensus site (p1133) was generated from p288 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-GCCTGACTTGCGAGAGGGGTCGAATGTTAT-3′ and 5′-CTATAACATTCGACCCCTCTCGCAAGTCAGG-3′. Generation of the mutation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. A full-length Dsg1 construct was altered at the C terminus by PCR addition of a FLAG tag, stop sequence, and BamHI, SnaBI, HindIII sites. A construct encoding full-length Dsg1 in pBluescript KS (p536) was digested with BglII/HindIII, and the resulting fragment was replaced with the PCR product to generate a construct encoding full-length Dsg1, FLAG-tagged at the C terminus in a pBluescript KS vector (p783). The entire FLAG-tagged Dsg1 region was removed from p783 with a BamHI digestion. This was cloned into the BamHI site in pTRE (Clontech) to generate an inducible construct encoding Dsg1.FLAG under the control of the tetracycline-responsive element (p812). Directionality of the insert was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. To generate a retroviral Dsg1 shRNA construct (shDsg1), short hairpin sequences for human Dsg1 were identified using the RNA OligoRetriever data base (http://katahdin.cshl.org:9331/homepage/siRNA/RNAi.cgi?type-shRNA). The human U6 promoter was attached to a 29-nucleotide short hairpin sequence of the Dsg1-coding region (nucleotides 3304-3332) using the PCR-based cloning strategy previously described (41Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Briefly, a forward primer (5′-CACCGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′) corresponding to the sp6 site upstream of the pGEM U6 promoter template and a reverse primer (5′-AAAAAAGTGATTCGACTTCGAACTATGCTAAGGAACAAGCTTCTCCCCTAGCACAGCTCGAAGTCGAATCACGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAA-3′) containing the 3′-end of the U6 promoter, an inverted repeat of the target Dsg1 sequence, and a RNA polymerase III termination site were used to amplify and subclone the shDsg1 into the retroviral vector, LZRS-Linker (42Kinsella T.M.

Transfectants were selected in 400 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Inc.). To verify that the drug-resistant lines expressed the tetracycline-responsive transactivator, a luciferase assay (pTRE-Luc, Clontech) was performed (pRL-CMV, Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega). Tetracycline-inducible Dsg1.FLAG lines were established by co-transfecting a G418-resistant single stable line, 68Q71, with a construct encoding Dsg1.FLAG under the control of the tetracycline-responsive element (p812) and a plasmid encoding the puromycin resistance gene (pSV2pacΔP). Cells were selected in 400 μg/ml G418 and 1 μg/ml puromycin (Calbiochem). Resistant clones were screened for expression of Dsg1.FLAG by overnight treatment with 4 μg/ml Dox. The cells were then lysed in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.

Proteolytic Cleavage of the Cytoplasmic Tail of Human Dsg1 in Vitro— 35S-Labeled wild type or mutant human Dsg1 cytoplasmic tail was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation of DNA constructs encoding nucleotides 24-276 plus 1740-3360 of Dsg1 with a C-terminal Myc tag (p288) or the altered form with an aspartic acid to glutamic acid substitution at amino acid 888 (p1133) using the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Radiolabeled Dsg1 tail was then incubated with 2.5 or 25 ng of recombinant caspase (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) for 1 h at 37 °C as described (50Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol.

Apoptosis Induction and Preparation of Cell Lysates—A431/B4 and HaCaT cells were cultured in 100 or 60-mm tissue culture dishes, and Dsg1 expression was induced. For inhibitor studies, the cells were preincubated with 50 μm ZVAD-fmk, 100 μm MMP inhibitor-1, or 50 μm TAPI-0 for 1 h before induction of apoptosis. The culture media was removed and saved, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Dishes were placed with open lids into a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) with about 2. 5 inches of 1 bulb (for A431 cells) or 1 entire bulb (for HaCaT cells) available for emission. The A431/B4 cells were subjected to 40 mJ/cm2 of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and the HaCaT cells were subjected to 250 mJ/cm2 to achieve 30-50% cell death after 24 h. Medium was returned to the dishes, and the cells were harvested at various time points. Floating cells were collected from the media by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min). Adherent cells were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer or 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7. 4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and Complete-EDTA-free protease inhibitor pellet) and combined with collected floating cells for immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—The total protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined using the Amido Black Assay (52Sheffield J.B. Graff D. Li H.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total protein in the cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (53Norvell S.M. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using primary antibodies at the following dilutions: anti-γ-catenin 1:2000; 1589 (anti-keratin 18) 1:1000; NW161 (anti-DP) 1:5000; goat anti-FLAG 1:5000; 982 (anti-Dsg1 N terminus) 1:1000; 18D4 (anti-Dsg1 intracellular domain) 1:100; Tub 2.1 (anti-β-tubulin) 1:1000; 4B2 (anti-Dsg1 C terminus) 1:1000; P124 (anti-Dsg1 extracellular domain) 1:100; rabbit anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1:2000; anti-caspase-3-HRP 1:1000; anti-PARP 1:2000; JL-8 (anti-GFP) 1:1000. Densitometry analysis was performed using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation—Floating and adherent cells were collected at various times after induction of apoptosis and pooled. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described (53Norvell S.M. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies used include 982 (2 μl) and FLAG (40 μl M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma)). Immunoprecipitation from the culture media was performed as above using 2 ml of media and 5 μl of 982. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—A431/B4 and HaCaT cells were grown on 22-mm2 glass coverslips, induced to express Dsg1, then treated or not with UV irradiation. A431/B4 cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 2 min. HaCaT cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed 3 times for 5 min each in PBS, then permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 2 min. Immunofluorescence/epifluorescence analysis was performed as described (54Chen X. Bonne S. Hatzfeld M. van Roy F. Green K.J. J. Biol.

Alexa Fluor anti-human, mouse, or rabbit secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:300. After the final wash the coverslips were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in 2 μg/ml DAPI. The coverslips were washed multiple times in PBS and mounted on slides with gelvatol. Images were obtained on a Leitz DMR microscope using a Hamamatsu Orca 100 digital camera and Openlab (Improvision) or Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corporation) imaging software. Quantitation of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was assessed by nuclear morphology analysis. Dsg1-expressing A431 or HaCaT floating and adherent cells were collected from tissue culture dishes and pooled at various times after exposure to UV radiation. They were fixed briefly in a 1.25% glutaraldehyde solution (Sigma). After several washes in PBS, the cells were stained with 2 μg/ml nuclear dye, DAPI, for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed and resuspended in PBS. At least 200 nuclei per sample were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy and scored for their fragmented/condensed appearance. The percent cell death in each sample was calculated based on the following formula: no. of apoptotic nuclei/(no. of normal nuclei + no. of apoptotic nuclei) × 100. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. To assess the effect of Dsg1 knockdown on cell death in HaCaT cells, UV-treated samples were processed for immunofluorescence analysis as above.

We have identified two meiotic proteins specifically required for this process. Stromalin in Meiosis (SNM) is a divergent member of the SCC3/SA/STAG family of cohesin proteins, and Modifier of Mdg4 in Meiosis (MNM) is one of many BTB-domain proteins expressed from the mod(mdg4) locus. SNM and MNM colocalize along with a repetitive rDNA sequence known to function as an X-Y pairing site to nucleolar foci during meiotic prophase and to a compact structure associated with the X-Y bivalent during prometaphase I and metaphase I. Additionally, MNM localizes to autosomal foci throughout meiosis I. These proteins are mutually dependent for their colocalization, and at least MNM requires the function of teflon, another meiotic gene. SNM and MNM do not colocalize with SMC1, suggesting that the homolog conjunction mechanism is independent of cohesin.

SNM and MNM do not colocalize with SMC1, suggesting that the homolog conjunction mechanism is independent of cohesin. Accurate segregation of chromosomes during meiosis is an obligate step in sexual reproduction. Errors in meiotic segregation, such as nondisjunction (NDJ) or chromosome loss, are major causes of spontaneous abortion, genetic illness, and infertility in humans (Hassold and Hunt, 2001Hassold T. Hunt P. To err (meiotically) is human: the genesis of human aneuploidy.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Homologs segregate from one another at the first meiotic division via a multistep pathway that initiates with their alignment and close pairing (Roeder, 1997Roeder G.S. Meiotic chromosomes: it takes two to tango.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, Page and Hawley, 2003Page S.L. Hawley R.S.

Homologous pairing and chromosome dynamics in meiosis and mitosis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gene Struct. Expres. 2004; 1677: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In most organisms, intimate pairing is accompanied by high frequencies of homologous recombination and stabilized by a complex structure known as synaptonemal complex (SC) (Heyting, 1996Heyting C. Synaptonemal complexes: structure and function.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, intimate homolog pairing is lost and the SC is disassembled at midprophase I long before homologs segregate. From then until segregation at anaphase I (Ana I), homologs are connected at discrete sites called chiasmata, which mark the sites where two homologous chromatids have crossed over (Carpenter, 1994Carpenter A.T. Chiasma function.Cell. 1994; 77: 957-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Chiasmata function as homolog connectors only because each recombined chromatid is connected by cohesins to two different sisters, one from each homolog (Petronczki et al., 2003Petronczki M. Siomos M.F. Nasmyth K. Un menage a quatre: the molecular biology of chromosome segregation in meiosis.Cell. 2003; 112: 123-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Homolog pairing is a virtually universal feature of meiosis, but crossing over, synapsis, and chiasmata are not. Alternative meiotic pathways that accomplish homolog segregation without crossing over or chiasmata have been described in numerous organisms, including some large taxonomic groups such as Lepidopteran females and Dipteran males (Wolf, 1994Wolf K.W. How meiotic cells deal with non-exchange chromosomes.Bioessays. 1994; 16: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Bombyx mori females undergo synapsis normally, but instead of disassembling at midprophase, the SC undergoes a modification that permits it to remain associated with the bivalents until Ana I (Rasmussen, 1977Rasmussen S.W. The transformation of the synaptonemal complex into the ‘elimination chromatin’ in Bombyx mori oocytes.Chromosoma. 1977; 60: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), presumably functioning as a substitute for chiasmata. However, in the best-documented example of “achiasmate” meiosis, that of Drosophila males, no SC is formed (Meyer, 1960Meyer G.F. The fine structure of spermatocyte nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster.in: Houwinck A.L. Spit B.J. Proceedings of the European Regional Conference on Electron Microscopy. Die Nederlandse Verening voor Electronmicroscopic Delft, Delft1960: 951-954Google Scholar) and the mechanical basis for homolog segregation is unknown. Prior to the meiotic divisions, spermatocytes undergo a lengthy G2/prophase I during which they increase 25-fold in volume. The chromosomes are uncondensed through this period and lack visible axes or other distinctive morphological features. However, three distinct chromatin masses, presumably corresponding to the three major bivalents (X-Y, 2nd, and 3rd), are apparent by mid-G2 and form distinct territories associated with the inside of the nuclear membrane G2 throughout late G2 (Cenci et al., 1994Cenci G. Bonaccorsi S. Pisano C. Verni F. Gatti M. Chromatin and microtubule organization during premeiotic, meiotic and early postmeiotic stages of Drosophila melanogaster spermatogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3521-3534PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, GFP-LacI tagging of chromosomally inserted lacO arrays revealed that homologous loci within the euchromatin are tightly paired throughout early G2 but that intimate pairing is lost in mid-G2 shortly after the chromosome pairs resolve into separate nuclear domains (Vazquez et al., 2002Vazquez J. Belmont A.S. Sedat J.W. The dynamics of homologous chromosome pairing during male Drosophila meiosis.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1473-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Distinct chromosomes appear only at the onset of condensation just prior to prometaphase I (PM I). In DAPI-stained preparations, they appear as compact masses in which neither the individual homologs nor any obvious connecting structures can be discriminated. In more disruptive acetic orcein squash protocols, the X and Y are sometimes pulled apart and can be seen to be connected by thread-like structures (of unknown composition) joining heterochromatic sites known as “collochores” near or within the nucleolus organizers (NORs), where the repeated genes for the 18S and 28S rRNAs are located (Cooper, 1950Cooper K.W. Normal spermatogenesis in Drosophila.in: Demerec M. Biology of Drosophila. John Wiley & Sons, New York1950: 1-61Google Scholar). We will use the term “conjunction” to refer to the physical connections between homologs that are visible in conventional cytological preparations at late prophase I and metaphase I (Meta I) and reserve the term “pairing” for the intimate association of homologous sequences revealed by the GFP-LacI or other molecular assays. Genetic analysis has directly implicated a 240 bp repeated sequence within the intergenic spacers of the rRNA genes as a specialized cis-acting X-Y pairing site. Deletions encompassing the entire X chromosome NOR disrupt X-Y pairing and cause random X-Y segregation; but transgenes containing either complete rDNA repeats or just arrays of 240 bp spacer repeats partially restore X-Y pairing and segregation when inserted on the heterochromatically deleted X (McKee, 2004McKee B.D. Homologous pairing and chromosome dynamics in meiosis and mitosis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gene Struct. Expres. 2004; 1677: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The genes responsible for this process are evidently distinct from those required for recombination, synapsis, and “distributive segregation” in female meiosis, as mutations in a substantial number of those genes have been found to have no effect on chromosome segregation in male meiosis (McKee, 2004McKee B.D. Homologous pairing and chromosome dynamics in meiosis and mitosis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gene Struct. Expres. 2004; 1677: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in a male-specific 2nd chromosome gene, teflon (tef), that cause nondisjunction of autosomes but not the X-Y pair were described (Tomkiel et al., 2001Tomkiel J.E. Wakimoto B.T. Briscoe Jr., A. The teflon gene is required for maintenance of autosomal homolog pairing at meiosis I in male Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 2001; 157: 273-281PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations cause premature dissociation of homologs, leading to their random assortment at Ana I. Here we describe mutations in two 3rd chromosome genes that, like tef mutants, cause premature dissociation of bivalents but affect the X-Y pair as well as the autosomes. These mutations disrupt two proteins that colocalize on chromosomes throughout meiosis I until their removal at Ana I and that are required for stable conjunction of all chromosome pairs in male meiosis. Genetic analysis of seven mutations identified in a screen for elevated paternal fourth chromosome loss (Wakimoto et al., 2004Wakimoto B.T. Lindsley D.L. Herrera C. Toward a comprehensive genetic analysis of male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 2004; 167: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) led to the identification of two genes on chromosome 3 (stromalin in meiosis [snm] and modifier of mdg4 in meiosis [mnm]). Mutations in these genes cause elevated frequencies of autosomal and sex chromosome NDJ but little or no sister chromatid NDJ (Tables S1 and S2). To gain insight into the origin of the NDJ revealed by the genetic data, we utilized immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze meiosis in snm and mnm mutants, focusing on two strong alleles of snm (Z3-0317 and Z3-2138) and the two mnm alleles (Z3-5578 and Z3-3298), all of which appear to be genetically null alleles (Tables S1 and S2). Although chromosome and spindle morphology appeared largely normal in snm and mnm spermatocytes, meiosis I chromosome segregation was clearly aberrant (Figure 1A ). Ana I appeared chaotic in mutant spermatocytes, with chromosomes distributed unevenly and asymmetrically along the spindle early in Ana I and with high frequencies of laggards at late Ana I. Most (>70%) late Ana I or telophase I cells exhibited polar chromatin masses of unequal size, indicating high frequencies of meiosis I NDJ (Figures 1A and 1B). By contrast, unequal poles were rare at anaphase II or telophase II, and most metaphase II and anaphase II figures were normal (Figure 1B), confirming the genetic evidence that NDJ in both groups of mutants is limited largely to meiosis I. Inspection of earlier stages revealed the likely cause of chaotic meiosis I segregation in snm and mnm mutants: the presence of unpaired chromosomes at PM I and Meta I (Figure 1A). In wild-type males, the chromosomes condense just prior to PM I to form three large, well-separated, DAPI-positive masses arrayed around the periphery of the nucleus, corresponding to the X-Y pair and the two large autosomal pairs (chromosomes 2 and 3), and a much smaller mass, corresponding to the fourth chromosome pair, which is inconsistently visible at this stage. After nuclear membrane breakdown, the bivalents congress to form a single mass centrally positioned on the Meta I spindle (Cenci et al., 1994Cenci G. Bonaccorsi S. Pisano C. Verni F. Gatti M. Chromatin and microtubule organization during premeiotic, meiotic and early postmeiotic stages of Drosophila melanogaster spermatogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3521-3534PubMed Google Scholar). In snm and mnm spermatocytes, up to eight distinct clumps were visible at PM I and Meta I. In many Meta I cells, a central mass was completely absent and multiple clumps were distributed along the polar axis. Nuclei with greater than eight clumps were never observed, indicating that the clumps represent bivalents and univalents, not single chromatids or chromosome fragments, consistent with a primary defect in formation or maintenance of bivalents. The genetic and cytological data taken together indicate that the primary meiotic defect in both mnm and snm mutants is a failure to form or maintain bivalents, leading to high frequencies of univalents at Meta I and random assortment of homologs at Ana I. To assess homologous pairing, a chimeric GFP-LacI protein was ectopically expressed in males homozygous for an insertion of a tandem array of lacO sequences on chromosome arm 2R. Depending on the cell-cycle stage, either two (G1) or four (G2) copies of the array are present, and depending upon the pairing status of the chromatids, binding of GFP-LacI to the lacO arrays can yield anywhere from one to four distinct GFP spots. In spermatogonia and young spermatocytes, sister chromatids are tightly paired (Vazquez et al., 2002Vazquez J. Belmont A.S. Sedat J.W. The dynamics of homologous chromosome pairing during male Drosophila meiosis.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1473-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and data not shown), so one typically sees either one spot or two, depending on whether homologs are paired or unpaired. In our study, snm and mnm mutant males were compared with wild-type (heterozygous) siblings. Males of all genotypes gave very similar results, exhibiting 66%–71% one-spot nuclei in mitotically dividing spermatogonia and 89%–91% one-spot nuclei in young primary spermatocytes in S phase or early meiotic G2/prophase (G1 is virtually nonexistent; Figures 2A and 2B ); this is in rough agreement with the findings of Vazquez et al., 2002Vazquez J. Belmont A.S. Sedat J.W. The dynamics of homologous chromosome pairing during male Drosophila meiosis.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1473-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar for wild-type males. These data indicate that in snm and mnm mutant males as well as in wild-type controls, homologs are already paired at high frequencies in premeiotic mitosis and that a further enhancement of homolog pairing frequencies accompanies the transition to meiosis. We conclude that bivalent instability in mnm and snm mutants is not due to failure of premeiotic or meiotic pairing of sister chromatids or homologs and that SNM and MNM must function at a step in the homolog segregation pathway specific for conjunction of homologs. In wild-type spermatocytes, pairing of sister and homologous sequences is lost simultaneously in mid-G2/prophase I, roughly coincident with the establishment of chromosome territories, and four distinct spots are visible throughout the remainder of meiosis I (Figure 2C; Vazquez et al., 2002Vazquez J. Belmont A.S. Sedat J.W. The dynamics of homologous chromosome pairing during male Drosophila meiosis.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1473-1483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both territory formation and loss of pairing occurred on schedule in mnm and snm mutants. However, whereas the separated GFP spots in wild-type remained confined to a single territorial domain throughout late G2, territorial restrictions were relaxed in both the snm and mnm spermatocytes, as reflected in significantly elevated average distances among allelic GFP-LacI spots in the mutants versus wild-type (Figures 2C and 2D). These measurements indicate that homologous loci wander farther from one another in snm and mnm mutants during late G2 than in wild-type. Moreover, DAPI-stained territories appeared unusually diffuse and lacking in definition in some, though not all, late G2 spermatocytes in both snm and mnm mutants (Figure 2C). This “territory expansion” phenotype is the earliest phenotype we have observed in mnm and snm mutants. The Z3-3298 and Z3-5578 mutations proved to be allelic to modifier of mdg4 (mod[mdg4]; data to be published separately), a complex locus that encodes more than 30 different proteins by alternative splicing (Dorn and Krauss, 2003Dorn R. Krauss V. The modifier of mdg4 locus in Drosophila: functional complexity is resolved by trans splicing.Genetica. 2003; 117: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The proteins share a 402-residue N terminus containing a BTB domain but have different, albeit similar, C termini, each encoded by one or two specific exons in the variable region of the gene (Figure 3A ). Most C termini encode a conserved C2H2 motif. Mutations in mod(mdg4) exhibit a variety of recessive and dominant phenotypes, including recessive lethality, disorganized neuromuscular synapses, modification of gypsy-induced mutations, enhancement of PEV, and others, but no meiotic phenotypes have been previously described (Dorn et al., 1993Dorn R. Krauss V. Reuter G. Saumweber H. The enhancer of position-effect variegation of Drosophila, E(var)3–93D, codes for a chromatin protein containing a conserved domain common to several transcriptional regulators.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 11376-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar; Gerasimova et al., 1995; Gorycza et al., 1999; Buchner et al., 2000Buchner K. Roth P. Schotta G. Krauss V. Saumweber H. Reuter G. Dorn R. Genetic and molecular complexity of the position effect variegation modifier mod(mdg4) in Drosophila.Genetics. 2000; 155: 141-157PubMed Google Scholar). Mod(mdg4)67.2, the only functionally characterized isoform, binds along with the zinc-finger protein Su(Hw) to chromatin insulator elements in the gypsy retrotransposon and is required for insulator function (Gerasimova and Corces, 1995). It localizes to hundreds of sites in polytene chromosomes, most of which are not within gypsy elements. In diploid cells, these coalesce into 15–25 perinuclear foci that anchor multiple chromatin loops that have been suggested to constitute functionally independent chromatin domains (Gerasimova et al., 2000Gerasimova T.I. Byrd K. Corces V.G. A chromatin insulator determines the nuclear localization of DNA.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Other Mod(mdg4) isoforms exhibit different chromosome localization patterns, suggesting that the variable C termini function to determine chromosome localization (Buchner et al., 2000Buchner K. Roth P. Schotta G. Krauss V. Saumweber H. Reuter G. Dorn R. Genetic and molecular complexity of the position effect variegation modifier mod(mdg4) in Drosophila.Genetics. 2000; 155: 141-157PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed that Z3-5578 and Z3-3298 contain single mutations within 100 base pairs of each other in the C-terminal coding exon of the DOOM/Mod(mdg4)56.3/MNM isoform (Figures 3A and 3B; Harvey et al., 1997Harvey A.J. Bidwai A.P. Miller L.K. Doom, a product of the Drosophila mod(mdg4) gene, induces apoptosis and binds to baculovirus inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins.Mol. Cell.

Genetic and molecular complexity of the position effect variegation modifier mod(mdg4) in Drosophila.Genetics. 2000; 155: 141-157PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutations disrupt the C2H2 motif within the partially conserved C-terminal FLYWCH domain present in most Mod(mdg4) isoforms (Dorn and Krauss, 2003Dorn R. Krauss V. The modifier of mdg4 locus in Drosophila: functional complexity is resolved by trans splicing.Genetica. 2003; 117: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Z3-3298 changes the first histidine residue into a tyrosine, and Z3-5578 truncates the protein upstream of the motif. A transgene expressing only MNM/Mod(mdg4)56.3 was found to fully suppress the meiotic phenotypes of both alleles, indicating that the MNM isoform is solely responsible for their meiotic effects (Figure 3D). Single base mutations resulting in the other five Z3 alleles were identified within CG13916 (Figure 3C). All five mutations are predicted to disrupt the coding sequence by introducing nonsense or missense codons or by disrupting a splice signal. A transgene containing wild-type CG13916 genomic sequences suppressed X-Y NDJ in Z3-0317/Z3-2138 males to a frequency below 0.5%, confirming that the identified mutations in CG13916/snm are responsible for the meiotic phenotypes (Figure 3D). snm is predicted to encode a 973 amino acid protein with 27% identity to D. melanogaster Stromalin (SA), one of four components (along with SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21) of the mitotic cohesin complex responsible for sister chromatid cohesion (Valdeolmillos et al., 1998Valdeolmillos A.

To determine the evolutionary relationships among SNM, SA, and other SCC3/STAG family proteins, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of SCC3/SA family protein sequences (Figure 3E), including two previously described meiosis-specific SCC3 proteins: REC11 of S. pombe and STAG3 of mice and humans (Prieto et al., 2001Prieto I. Suja J.A. Pezzi N. Kremer L. Martinez A.C. Rufas J.S. Barbero J.L. Mammalian STAG3 is a cohesin specific to sister chromatid arms in meiosis I.Nat.

Distinct cohesin complexes organize meiotic chromosome domains.Science. 2003; 300: 1152-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three meiotic SCC3/SA family members (SNM, REC11, and STAG3) are more closely related to their respective mitotic paralogs (SA, PSC3, and STAG1/STAG2) than to each other, indicative of independent evolutionary origins for the meiotic SCC3/STAG proteins. Two additional observations support the hypothesis of an independent origin for snm. First, only one SCC3 family member is present in the completed Anopheles genome. Since Anopheles, like Drosophila, belongs to the order Diptera, this observation suggests that snm arose via a duplication event within the Dipteran lineage after the divergence of Anopheles. Second, three of the five snm introns are located at matching sites in the Drosophila snm and SA genes, consistent with the notion that the two genes arose by a relatively recent duplication event (Figure 3C). To assess the localization of MNM, we made use of the C-terminal EGFP tag on the [hs::MNM-GFP] transgene, which fully rescues the mnm meiotic phenotypes (Figure 3D). Testes of both heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked [hs::MNM-GFP] males exhibited MNM-GFP fluorescence (more intensely in heat-shocked males) mainly in primary spermatocytes. Unexpectedly, the most prominent site of localization during G2 was the nucleolus. MNM-GFP fluorescence first appeared in very young primary spermatocytes, developed into a prominent, approximately round cluster of foci by early-mid G2, which persisted until the G2-M transition when the nucleolus dissociates (Figure 4, Figure 5). Two antibodies against SNM gave very similar staining patterns, co-localizing with MNM-GFP almost perfectly throughout G2 (Figure 4A). The staining was shown to be nucleolar, based on rough co-localization with the nucleolar protein fibrillarin (Figure 4B) (Ochs et al., 1985Ochs R.L. Lischwe M.A. Spohn W.H. Busch H. Fibrillarin: a new protein of the nucleolus identified by autoimmune sera.Biol. Cell. 1985; 54: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Most of the MNM-GFP foci did not directly overlap fibrillarin foci, however (Figure 4B), suggesting that the two proteins are functionally unrelated despite cohabiting the nucleolus. Nucleolar staining was completely absent in all four strong snm mutants, indicating that the antibody staining is specific for the SNM protein (Figure 6A and not shown). (A) Colocalization of MNM-GFP and SNM in primary spermatocyte nuclei from wild-type [hs::MNM-GFP] males. Fixed spermatocytes were stained with anti-GFP, anti-SNM, and DAPI.

Each panel shows a single nucleus. Size bar = 5 μM. (A) Unfixed spermatocytes from wild-type males stained with Hoechst 33342 and imaged for MNM-GFP fluorescence (upper panels: GFP only; lower panels: merge of GFP and Hoechst 33342). Each panel shows one nucleus. Paired MNM-GFP foci (arrows, far-right panels) are embedded within condensed autosomal bivalents at PM I. Size bar = 5 μM. (B) Unfixed spermatocytes from snm or tef males expressing MNM-GFP. Note: All panels in both (A) and (B) are overexposed relative to the nucleolar or X-Y signals to bring out the fainter autosomal signals. Size bar = 5 μM. (A and B) Spermatocytes were stained with anti-SNM (red) and DAPI (blue); upper panels with anti-SNM only. Panels in (A) show two nuclei each; panels in (B) show one nucleus each. Size bar = 5 μM. Following chromosome condensation, the loose cluster of nucleolar MNM-GFP foci was replaced by a single dense spot of MNM-GFP staining approximately 1 μM in diameter, associated with one of the three major bivalents at PM I (Figure 4, Figure 5). Identical staining patterns were seen with an antibody against the common region of Mod(mdg4) (anti-ModC; Figure 4C) and with both antibodies against SNM, the antibody signals completely overlapping the MNM-GFP fluorescence in wild-type spermatocytes (Figure 4A). Although the anti-ModC antibody should react with all Mod(mdg4) isoforms, no nuclear signals are present in PM I or Meta I spermatocytes in males lacking the MNM isoform, indicating that MNM is the only Mod(mdg4) isoform present in mature meiosis I nuclei (data not shown). The anti-SNM and anti-Mod(mdg4) staining patterns were completely ablated by strong snm and mnm mutations, respectively (Figure 6B and data not shown). The prominent chromosomal SNM-MNM focus persisted through Meta I but disappeared at Ana I (Figure 4A). To determine which bivalent exhibits the strong SNM-MNM signals, we hybridized spermatocytes from wild-type males with a fluorescently labeled FISH probe specific for the X and Y chromosomes and stained the spermatocytes simultaneously with antibodies against either SNM or MNM and for DNA. The target of the FISH probe was a 240 bp repeat (240 Rpt) located in the intergenic spacers of the rRNA genes that has been shown genetically to function as an X-Y pairing site (McKee, 2004McKee B.D. Homologous pairing and chromosome dynamics in meiosis and mitosis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gene Struct. Expres. 2004; 1677: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As expected, the 240 Rpt probe hybridized to multiple nucleolar foci during G2 and to a restricted region of the condensed X-Y bivalent at PM I. Importantly, it colocalized strongly with both SNM and MNM at PM I, demonstrating that the prominent SNM-MNM signal is associated with the X-Y bivalent (Figures 4C and 4D). MNM-GFP foci were also observed within autosomal chromatin in [hs::MNM-GFP] males throughout G2 and during PM I (Figure 5A). Autosomal MNM-GFP foci were smaller and fainter than nucleolar foci but nevertheless easily discernible above background. In early and midG2 nuclei, the major autosome"

Recently it emerged that transcription is also coupled to the alteration of chromatin structure. The histone methyltransferases Set1 and Set2, which catalyze methylation of histone H3 lysines Lys4 and Lys36, respectively, are associated with Pol II during elongation (reviewed in Refs. 14Gerber M.

Histone methylation apparently controls newly initiated Pol II, and two phases of histone H3 methylation can be distinguished after transcription initiation (16Morillon A. Karabetsou N. Nair A.

Set2 interacts with the Pol II CTD via a novel domain, the Set2 Rpb1-interacting (SRI) domain (22Kizer K.O. Phatnani H.P. Shibata Y. Hall H. Greenleaf A.L. Strahl B.D. Mol.

In vivo, deletion of the Set2 SRI domain abolishes H3 Lys36 methylation and impairs transcription elongation (22Kizer K.O. Phatnani H.P. Shibata Y. Hall H. Greenleaf A.L. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3305-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), suggesting that the SRI domain is responsible for coupling transcription to histone methylation by Set2. Here we report the solution structure of the Set2 SRI domain from the yeast S. cerevisiae and present NMR binding experiments with phospho-CTD peptides. Our results elucidate the molecular determinants for Set2 CTD binding, which underlies coupling of transcription to Set2-directed chromatin modification. Sample Preparation—The region of the gene of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set2 protein (Swiss Prot P46995) encoding for Set2 residues 620–719 was cloned into a modified pET9d vector with an NH2-terminal hexahistidine tag. The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli pLysS cells at 18 °C for 16 h. For labeling of the protein with 15N/13C or 15N, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with [13C6]glucose and/or 15NH4Cl. Cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Quiagen), followed by cleavage of the hexahistidine tag with tobacco etch virus protease and dialysis overnight. The tag and the His6-tagged protease were removed on a second Ni-NTA column. DNA was removed by cation exchange chromatography (Mono S, Amersham Biosciences). After gel filtration the sample was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. Edman sequencing of the protein confirmed the presence of four additional residues (GAMG) at the NH2 terminus, which result from the cloning strategy. NMR samples were prepared in H2O or 100% D2O at 0.4–1 mm concentration of protein. NMR Structure Determination—NMR spectra were acquired at 292 K on Bruker DRX500, DRX600, or DRX900 spectrometers with cryogenic triple resonance probes. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRVIEW (25Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). The 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts were assigned by standard methods (26Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from two-dimensional NOESY and 15N- or 13C-resolved three-dimensional NOESY. Restraints for the backbone angles ϕ and ψ were derived from TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from 1H,15N correlation experiments after dissolving of lyophilized protein in D2O. 15N relaxation (T1, T2) and heteronuclear (1H)-15N NOE was measured on a 15N-labeled protein sample at 292 K as described (28Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). The experimentally determined distance and dihedral restraints (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 1C) were applied in a simulated-annealing protocol using ARIA (29Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and CNS (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

NOEs were manually assigned and distance calibrations were performed by ARIA. The final ensemble of NMR structures was refined in a shell of water molecules (31Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M. Proteins. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Structural quality was analyzed with PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide Interaction Studies—The phospho-CTD peptides used for binding experiments were chemically synthesized (one-repeat peptide, YpSPTp-SPS; two-repeat peptide, SPS-YpSPTpSPS-YpSPTpSPS, pS = phosphoserine). For NMR titration, increasing amounts of the CTD peptide were added to a 0.4 mm solution of 15N,13C-labeled SRI domain up to a 1.25-fold molar excess. Chemical shifts were monitored in two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC experiments. The Set2 SRI Domain Forms a Conserved Three-helix Bundle—The solution structure of the yeast Set2 SRI domain was determined by multidimensional NMR (supplemental Table S1; also see “Experimental Procedures”). The structure revealed three α-helices arranged in a left-handed bundle (Fig. 1). The NH2-terminal helix α1 is slightly kinked at residues Phe639 and Val640, and the linker between helices α1 and α2 includes a short 310-helical turn at residues Ser650– Gln652. A hydrophobic core is formed by numerous residues located at the interface between the three helices, including four residues in the two regions linking the helices (Fig. 1C). Consistently the heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE measurements demonstrate that the polypeptide backbone in all three helices and the connecting linker regions is rigid (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). The hydrophobic core residues are generally conserved across species (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that our structure is a good model for SRI domains in Set2 of other species. The SRI Domain Defines a Novel CTD-binding Fold—Comparison with the five known structures of CTD-binding domains reveals that the SRI domain defines a novel CTD-binding fold. Other CTD-binding domains include FF domains, CTD-interacting domains, WW domains, BRCT domains, and a domain in the Cgt1 subunit of the 5′-capping enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 7Meinhart A. Kamenski T. Hoeppner S. Baumli S. Cramer P. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1401-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Of these, FF and CTD-interacting domains also form helical bundles (33Allen M. Friedler A. Schon O. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Meinhart A. Cramer P. Nature. 2004; 430: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but, in contrast to the SRI domain, the superhelical arrangement in these two domains is right-handed (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus the six CTD-binding domains that have been structurally characterized use different folds for specific CTD recognition. The SRI Domain Binds a Two-repeat CTD Phosphopeptide—To characterize the CTD-binding determinants of the SRI domain, we performed NMR titration experiments with Ser2/Ser5-phosphorylated CTD peptides (Fig. 1C). A phosphopeptide consisting of a single CTD repeat (YpSPTpSPS, pS = phosphoserine; Fig. S3A) did not perturb chemical shifts in a two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectrum, indicating that there is no significant binding (data not shown). However, titration with a peptide that comprised two CTD repeats and three flanking NH2-terminal residues (SPS-YpSPTpSPS-YpSPTp-SPS) resulted in many strong chemical shift perturbations (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S3). From the titration data the dissociation constant is estimated to be in the low micromolar range, comparable with the reported approximate affinity of 6 μm for a CTD phosphopeptide comprising three repeats (22Kizer K.O. Phatnani H.P. Shibata Y. Hall H. Greenleaf A.L. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3305-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Regions in the SRI Domain That Interact with the CTD—Residues that show strong chemical shift perturbations of their backbone NH groups cluster in two regions on the SRI domain structure (Fig. 2A). The first region includes residues Lys634, Phe635 in α1, and Ala662, Val666, Lys667, Thr670, Thr671, and Glu673 in α2, whereas the second region includes residues Phe653, His655, Glu656 in the α1-α2 linker, and residue Ile705 in α3 (Figs. 1C and 2A and supplemental Fig. S3). With the exception of Ile705, the strongest perturbations upon peptide binding were observed in region 1 (Phe635, Ala662, Val666, Lys667, and Glu673). In this region, the side chain NH2 groups of residues Asn631 and Asn633 also show significant chemical shift perturbations (supplemental Fig. S3B). Both regions are conserved among fungal Set2 homologues (Fig. 2B), befitting the conserved function of the Saccharomyces pombe and Neurospora crassa Set2 homologues (35Morris S.A. Shibata Y. Noma K. Tsukamoto Y. Warren E. Temple B. Grewal S.I. Strahl B.D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1446-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Adhvaryu K.K. Morris S.A. Strahl B.D. Selker E.U. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The observation of two putative CTD-binding regions, and the finding that two CTD repeats are required for SRI domain binding, indicate that the phospho-CTD extends over a long distance along helices α1 and α2 and the connecting linker. CTD Tyrosine Side Chains Contribute to SRI Domain Binding—The peptide titration experiments also revealed that the two-repeat CTD peptide (supplemental Fig. S3A) binds to the SRI domain via its tyrosine residues. Intermolecular NOEs between both CTD tyrosine side chains and the SRI domain were detected (data not shown). Preliminary assignments indicate that one of the tyrosine side chains is in proximity of residues Ala662 and Val666 in region 1 (Figs. 1C and 2B). These two residues are part of a hydrophobic patch between helices α1 and α2 and flanked by positively charged surfaces (Fig. 2C), as expected for interaction with the negatively charged phospho-CTD. Interestingly, the tyrosine-proximal residue Ala662 is identical in human Set2, as are Phe635, Glu656, and Glu673 in the putative CTD-binding regions (Fig. 1C). In the three known CTD-protein complex structures, the Y1 side chain is also involved in hydrophobic contacts (34Meinhart A. Cramer P.

Previous studies revealed that the CTD can adopt different conformations (reviewed in Ref. 7Meinhart A. Kamenski T. Hoeppner S. Baumli S. Cramer P. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1401-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and this structurally versatile nature of the CTD discourages any detailed model building. The SRI Domain Resembles a Polymerase-interacting Domain in Bacterial σ Factors—Comparison of our structure with known folds in the data base (DALI (39Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar)) strikingly shows that the SRI domain resembles a region in bacterial σ factors (Fig. 3). The four highest hits were the σ factors σ28 (PDB code 1rp3), σE (PDB-code 1or7), σR (PDB code 1h3l), and σ70 (PDB code 1sig), which show DALI scores of 5.6, 5.4, 5.1, and 4.9, respectively, and root mean square deviations between 3.3 and 3.7 Å. The region in σ70 that is structurally related to the SRI domain is domain 2 (σ2), which interacts with the clamp region of the core RNA polymerase upon formation of the holoenzyme (40Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The σ2 domain is involved in binding the –10 element of promoter DNA and contributes to DNA melting during initiation (reviewed in Ref. 41Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic initiation complex, promoter DNA around position –10 lies near the NH2-terminal domain of the initiation factor TFIIEα (42Forget D. Langelier M.-F. Therien C. Trinh V. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1122-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which shows weak sequence homology (43Okhuma Y. Sumimoto H. Hoffmann A. Shimasaki S. Horikoshhi M. Roeder R.

We speculate that the eukaryotic TFIIEα NH2-terminal domain, which may contact promoter DNA, and the Set2 SRI domain, which binds the negatively charged phospho-CTD, both evolved from the bacterial σ2 domain.

https://openalex.org/W2023440295,"VEGFR-1 is a kinase-defective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and negatively modulates angiogenesis by acting as a decoy receptor. The decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1 is required for normal development and angiogenesis. To date, there is no molecular explanation for this unusual characteristic of VEGFR-1. Here we show that the molecular mechanisms underlying the decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1 is linked to the replacement of a highly conserved amino acid residue in the activation loop. This amino acid is highly conserved among all the type III RTKs and corresponds to aspartic acid, but in VEGFR-1 it is substituted to asparagine. Mutation of asparagine (Asn1050) within the activation loop to aspartic acid promoted enhanced ligand-dependent tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activation in vivo and in vitro. The mutant VEGFR-1 (Asp1050) promoted endothelial cell proliferation but not tubulogenesis. It also displayed an oncogenic phenotype as its expression in fibroblast cells elicited transformation and colony growth. Furthermore, mutation of the invariable aspartic acid to asparagine in VEGFR-2 lowered the autophosphorylation of activation loop tyrosines 1052 and 1057. We propose that the conserved aspartic acid in the activation loop favors the transphosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines, and its absence renders RTK to a less potent enzyme by disfavoring transphosphorylation of activation loop tyrosines.

VEGFR-1 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1/FLT-1) is the prototype of a receptor tyrosine kinase gene family encoding structurally related receptors including FLK-1 (VEGFR-2), FLT-3 (FLK-2), and FLT-4 (VEGFR-3) (1Hanks S. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 200: 38-62Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). VEGFR-1 is expressed by endothelial cells and acts a high affinity receptor for VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placenta growth factor (2Tjwa M. Luttun A. Autiero M. Carmeliet P. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 314: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of VEGFR-1 in angiogenesis is not known, its presence is required for normal development and angiogenesis. Targeted deletion of VEGFR-1 results in early embryonic lethality due to abnormal overgrowth of endothelial cells (6Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar, 13Fong G.H. Zhang L. Bryce D.M. Peng J. Development. 1999; 126: 3015-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that VEGFR-1 negatively modulates angiogenesis by acting as a decoy receptor by trapping VEGF 2The abbreviations used are: VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorRTKreceptor tyrosine kinaseFBSfetal bovine serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPLCγ1phospholipase Cγ1. 2The abbreviations used are: VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorRTKreceptor tyrosine kinaseFBSfetal bovine serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPLCγ1phospholipase Cγ1. and thus preventing VEGF from binding to and activating VEGFR-2 (5Rahimi N.

Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Consistent with genetic studies, selective activation of VEGFR-1 results in no significant proliferation and migration of endothelial cells in vitro (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 9Meyer R.D. Singh A. Majnoun F. Latz C. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5523-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Also stimulation of VEGFR-1 in a defined condition antagonizes VEGFR-2-mediated proliferation of endothelial cells (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Tyrosine autophosphorylation represents a crucial event in the activation of RTKs. The basic principles of RTK activation can be summarized as follows: ligand-mediated dimerization of receptor monomers, transphosphorylation by dimerized receptors, and docking of signaling proteins to receptor phosphotyrosines. An increase in the intrinsic catalytic activity and creation of binding sites on the RTKs to recruit cytoplasmic signaling proteins are primary features of RTK activation (11Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 33Huse M. Kuriyan J.

In this context, VEGFR-1 is considered to be a kinase-impaired RTK (e.g. VEGFR-1 is poorly tyrosine-phosphorylated, and its ability to phosphorylate substrate is negligible).It could be argued that the decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1 is not an accidental event but rather serves an important biological role in embryonic development and pathological angiogenesis. It is not known to what the decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1 can be attributed. VEGFR-1, like other RTKs, possesses all of the known signatures of RTKs, such as GXGXXG, an ATP binding motif, HRDLA, a motif essential for catalysis, and many potential tyrosine autophosphorylation sites within its kinase domain and carboxyl tail (1Hanks S. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 200: 38-62Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 2Tjwa M. Luttun A. Autiero M. Carmeliet P.

Despite having these similarities with other RTKs, ligand stimulation of VEGFR-1 results only in minor tyrosine autophosphorylation of VEGFR-1 in vivo and in vitro (3de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 4Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5523-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, it is highly likely that the poor tyrosine autophosphorylation of VEGFR-1 may account for its decoy characteristic. Current literature on VEGFR-1 indicates that the kinase-defective characteristic of VEGFR-1 is not associated with its extracellular domain or juxtamembrane domain. Replacing the extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 with that of CSF-1R or epidermal growth factor receptor (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) or its juxtamembrane region with that of VEGFR-2 does not alter its kinase-impaired characteristic (19Gille H. Kowalski J. Yu L. Chen H. Pisabarro M.T. Davis-Smyth T. Ferrara N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4064-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In fact, the extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 displays a higher affinity to VEGF than that of VEGFR-2 (20Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar, 25Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A more recent study demonstrated that substitution of carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2 with that of VEGFR-1 could rescue its kinase-defective activity (9Meyer R.D. Singh A. Majnoun F. Latz C. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5523-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In this study, we wished to determine the molecular determinant of decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1. Our search of protein-tyrosine kinase data base revealed an alteration in the activation loop of VEGFR-1. In the activation loop of VEGFR-1, Asp, an amino acid that is highly conserved in all of the type III RTKs is substituted to Asn. We demonstrate that substitution of this invariable amino acid in the activation loop of human VEGFR-1 is responsible for the decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and Antibodies—Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit anti-VEGFR-2 was made against amino acids corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2. Rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine 1173 VEGFR-2 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA): rabbit and goat polyclonal anti-FLT-1, goat anti-rabbit antibody, goat anti-mouse antibody, and donkey anti-goat antibody antibodies. Recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). ATP, Protein G-Sepharose, and poly-Glu (4:1 Glu, Tyr) peptide were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phospho-Tyr1057/1059 VEGFR-2 antibody was purchased from BIOSOURCE International.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNA for human VEGFR-1, chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR), and chimeric VEGFR-2 (CKR) were used as template to generate the mutants D1050/CTR, D1050/VEGFR-1, and N1054/CKR, respectively. The creation of chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR) and VEGFR-2 (CKR), in which their extracellular domain is replaced with that of human CSF-1R, was described elsewhere (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The mutations were made using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method as previously described (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out using Accuprime Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The resultant mutations were verified by sequencing and were subsequently cloned into pLXSN2 or pLNCX2 retroviral vectors.In Vitro Kinase Assay and Substrate Phosphorylation—Equal numbers of porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells expressing either CTR, D1050/CTR, VEGFR-1, or D1050/VEGFR-1 were serum-starved overnight and lysed without stimulation. CTR and D1050/CTR proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-1/FLT-1 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed once with cold lysis buffer, pH 7.4 (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and three times with cold PAN buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mg/ml aprotinin). An in vitro kinase assay was performed by incubating immunoprecipitated proteins with 20 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1-1 mm ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. The samples were denatured and resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. To measure the ability of CTR and mutant D1050/CTR to phosphorylate substrate (poly-Glu peptide), cells were stimulated with ligand for 10 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-1 antibody. Substrate phosphorylation was measured as described (27Rahimi N. Hung W. Tremblay E. Saulnier R. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated in 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of substrate (5 μg/reaction). The reaction was stopped, and samples were spotted on the p81 paper, and after extensive washing the p81 papers were subjected to a scintillation counter, and their dpm values were measured.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—PAE cells expressing CTR or D1050/CTR were grown in sparse conditions in 10% FBS and serum-starved overnight. Cells were left either resting or stimulated with 40 ng/ml CSF-1 at 37 °C for appropriate times as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were washed twice with H/S buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4) and lysed in lysis (EB) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). VEGFR-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-1 antibody, and immune complexes were bound to Protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis, the membranes were then incubated in Block buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mg/ml ovalbumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.005% NaN3 and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in Block. The membranes were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies. Finally, the membranes were washed, and developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In some instances, the membranes were stripped by incubating them in a buffer containing 6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 50 °C for 30 min and reprobed.Thymidine Uptake Assay—CSF-1-stimulated cell proliferation was measured by uptake of [3H]thymidine as described before (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/ml in DMEM containing 10% FBS in 24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. Cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and growth-arrested in DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C. Various amounts of CSF-1 were added and incubated for 18-20 h at 37 °C. Cells were pulsed for 4 h with [3H]thymidine (0.2 μCi/ml) and harvested and measured by a scintillation counter. Quadruplicate samples were performed for each group. Three independent experiments were performed, and essentially the same results were obtained.Tubulogenesis/in Vitro Angiogenesis Assay—Spheroids of PAE cells expressing CTR, CKR, D1050/CTR, and D1054/CKR were prepared as previously described (9Meyer R.D. Singh A. Majnoun F. Latz C. Lashkari K. Rahimi N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5523-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Meyer R.D. Latz C. Rahimi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16347-16355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in DMEM containing 1% FBS and 0.24% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose plus 4000 centipoise in nonadherent round bottom 96-well plates at standard cell culture conditions. After 8-12 h, all cells formed one single spheroid per well (750 cells/spheroid). Spheroids were cultured for 2 days before using them in the in vitro angiogenesis assay in the following manner. Before spheroids were embedded in collagen gels, they were centrifuged and suspended in DMEM, containing 0.96% carboxymethylcellulose. Collagen and spheroids were mixed and transferred to prewarmed 24-well plates, and the gels were allowed to polymerize in the incubator. After 30 min, 100 μl of DMEM containing CSF-1 was added on top of the gel. Sprouting and tubulogenesis was observed after 2 days under an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Leica), and pictures were taken using a digital camera system.Transformation Assays—Colony formation of NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells expressing chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR) or D1050/CTR were analyzed in a soft agar colony formation assay in the following manner. Briefly, a solution of 1.2% agar was mixed (1:1) with 2× DMEM, supplemented with 7% FBS, and layered onto a 6-well tissue culture plate and allowed to solidify. Cells (103/2.5 ml) were mixed in a 0.36% agar solution prepared in a similar way and layered (2.5 ml/plate) on top of the 0.6% agar. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 18-22 days. Colonies were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with 4% Giemsa blue, and photographed with an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Leica) using a digital camera system. In addition, the focus formation of NIH-3T3 cells expressing chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR) or D1050/CTR was analyzed. For this purpose, cells were cultured in 10% FBS in the presence of CSF-1 for up to 21 days. Spontaneous focus formation of fibroblast cells was negligible. At the end of the assay, the cells were photographed with an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Leica) using a digital camera system.RESULTSA Highly Conserved Aspartic Acid Residue in the Activation Loop of VEGFR-1 Is Substituted to Asparagine—FLT-1 (VEGFR-1) is a member of the gene family receptor tyrosine kinases, encoding structurally related receptors including FLK-1 (VEGFR-2), FLT-3/FLK-2, and FLT-4/VEGFR-3 (1Hanks S. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 200: 38-62Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). All of the protein kinases have conserved residues and homologous stretches cored on 12 subdomains within ∼300 amino acids. Subdomains VII and VIII represent the activation loop starting with Asp, Phe, and Gly and ending with Ala, Pro, and Glu (21Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The activation loop plays a critical role in the enzymatic activation of RTK (1Hanks S. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 200: 38-62Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 21Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment of the activation loop of type III RTKs revealed that in VEGFR-1 a highly conserved amino acid Asp is replaced with Asn (Fig. 1). This substitution is not restricted to human VEGFR-1; it is also conserved among the mouse, rat, and chicken VEGFR-1. All of the other known signatures of RTKs, such HRDLA and DFG sequences, which are essential for catalysis, are preserved in VEGFR-1 (Fig. 1). This uncommon amino acid substitution in a critical position has raised the possibility that this substitution might play a role in a kinase-impaired characteristic of VEGFR-1. To test this notion, we have replaced the asparagine of human VEGFR-1 at position 1050 to aspartic acid and tested its effect on VEGFR-1 activation and function.The Asp1050 Mutant VEGFR-1 Displays Increased Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Kinase Activation—To determine the effect of the mutation of Asn at position 1050 of human VEGFR-1 to Asp on its ligand-stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation, we expressed wild type chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR) and D1050/CTR in PAE cells. We previously have reported the creation and biochemical characterization of a chimeric VEGFR-1 termed CTR in which the extracellular domain of the human CSF-1R was fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human VEGFR-1 (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We took this unique approach in order to eliminate potential cross-talk between VEGFR-1 and other VEGFR family members.To measure the ability of CTR and D1050/CTR to undergo in vivo tyrosine autophosphorylation, cells were stimulated with CSF-1, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with an anti-VEGFR-1 antibody and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2A). The result showed that the wild type chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR) after ligand stimulation underwent a low tyrosine phosphorylation. In sharp contrast, ligand stimulation of cells expressing D1050/CTR promoted robust tyrosine phosphorylation of D1050/CTR. The maximal autophosphorylation of D1050/CTR peaked after 10 min and gradually decreased after 30 min of stimulation with ligand (Fig. 2A). For comparative purposes, the ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 chimera (CKR) also is determined. VEGFR-2 is a highly active kinase, and upon ligand stimulation, it undergoes robust tyrosine phosphorylation (5Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To further analyze the role of aspartic acid on the catalytic activity of VEGFR-1, we tested the ability of wild type CTR and D1050/CTR to phosphorylate exogenous substrate as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 2C, the wild type CTR phosphorylated only a trace amount of substrate (less than 0.2-fold). Under identical experimental conditions, a 1.8-fold increase in substrate phosphorylation was observed for D1050/CTR (Fig. 2C). Collectively, the data suggest that mutation of asparagine 1050 to aspartic acid increases the ability of VEGFR-1 to undergo enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and its capacity to phosphorylate exogenous substrate.FIGURE 2Replacement of asparagine 1050 to aspartic acid unleashes the poor tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activation of VEGFR-1. Serum-starved PAE cells individually expressing either wild type chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR), mutant VEGFR-1 (D1050/CTR), or CKR (chimeric VEGFR-2) were stimulated with CSF-1 for the indicated periods of times. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (Ipt) with an anti-VEGFR-1 antibody or anti-VEGFR-2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were divided to two groups and were subjected to Western blot analysis using either an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (A) or anti-VEGFR-1 and anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies for protein levels (B). Serum-starved PAE cells expressing CTR and D1050/CTR were left unstimulated or stimulated for 10 min with CSF-1, lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-1 antibody, and subjected to in vitro kinase assay using poly-Glu peptide as a substrate as described under “Materials and Methods” (C). Results are expressed as arbitrary units (AU) corresponding to the dpm values obtained from counting of the phosphorylation of substrate with a scintillation counter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test further the effect of mutation of asparagine 1050 to aspartic acid, we evaluated the ability of D1050/CTR to undergo tyrosine autophosphorylation in vitro in response to ATP stimulation. To this end, serum-starved cells expressing either chimeric VEGFR-1 or Asp1050 mutant chimeric VEGFR-1 were lysed without stimulation with ligand and immunoprecipitated with anti-VEGFR-1 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with different concentrations of ATP. After 15 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped and was subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As presented in Fig. 3A, the wild type chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR) underwent detectable but not robust tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ATP, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced with increasing concentrations of ATP. In sharp contrast, the mutant receptor, D1050/CTR, under similar experimental conditions underwent robust tyrosine autophosphorylation. For comparative purposes, PAE cells expressing the VEGFR-2 chimera (CKR) were stimulated with ATP in a similar manner and analyzed for their ability to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. The quantitation of autophosphorylation of the wild type receptor and the mutant receptor, Asp1050, revealed that the Asp1050 autophosphorylation was at least 2-fold higher than the wild type receptor (Fig. 3C). The basal tyrosine autophosphorylation of Asp1050 receptor also was enhanced in response to both ligand and ATP stimulation (Figs. 2A and 3A).FIGURE 3In vitro kinase activation of CTR and D1050/CTR. Serum-starved PAE cells expressing wild type chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR), D1050/CTR, or CKR were lysed without stimulation, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (Ipt) with an anti-VEGFR-1 antibody or VEGFR-2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using ATP at different concentrations as indicated. The reaction stopped after 15 min, and samples were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described under “Materials and Methods” (A). The same membranes were reprobed with an anti-VEGFR-1 and anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies for protein levels (B).

AU (arbitrary units). Serum-starved PAE cells expressing wild type chimeric VEGFR-1 (CTR), or D1050/CTR were lysed without stimulation, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-VEGFR-1 antibody and divided into two groups. One group was subjected to in vitro kinase assay using cold ATP (1 mm) and incubated for the indicated periods of time. Samples were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described under “Materials and Methods” (D). The second group was blotted for protein level using anti-VEGFR-1 antibody (E). Quantitation of tyrosine phosphorylation of CTR and D1050/CTR in response to ATP stimulation is shown (F).

As presented in Fig. 3, Asp1050 VEGFR-1 underwent tyrosine autophosphorylation at a higher rate, and its maximal autophosphorylation was reached after a 30-min incubation with ATP. The tyrosine autophosphorylation of wild type chimeric VEGFR-1 in response to ATP was slow. The magnitude and intensity of its tyrosine phosphorylation never reached that of D1050/CTR (Fig. 3D). Indeed, the maximum tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type VEGFR-1 in response to ATP was reached after 60 min of incubation. In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation of D1050/CTR was much enhanced; its maximum tyrosine phosphorylation reached after 30 min of incubation with ATP and remained high after 60 min of incubation (Fig. 3, D and F). Altogether, these results suggest that the decoy characteristic of VEGFR-1 is associated with its inability to induce a threshold of its kinase activation. The lack of maximal threshold activation of VEGFR-1 appears to be directly associated with the presence of asparagine 1050.D1050 Mutant VEGFR-1 Promotes Proliferation but Not Tubulogenesis of Endothelial Cells—Proliferation and tubulogenesis of endothelial cells are critical steps in angiogenesis. To test the biological impact of mutation of asparagine 1050 to aspartic acid, we tested the ability of the wild type and the mutant Asp1050 mutant receptor to stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells. The results showed that the activation of wild type chimeric VEGFR-1 as previously reported (4Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

The metal ion dependence of ADAMTS13 activity was examined with multimeric VWF and a fluorescent peptide substrate based on Asp1596–Arg1668 of the VWF A2 domain, FRETS-VWF73. ADAMTS13 activity in citrate-anticoagulated plasma was enhanced ∼2-fold by zinc ions, ∼3-fold by calcium ions, and ∼6-fold by both ions, suggesting cooperative activation. Cleavage of VWF by recombinant ADAMTS13 was activated up to ∼200-fold by zinc ions (KD app ∼0.5 μm), calcium ions (KD app ∼4.8 μm), and barium ions (KD app ∼1.7 mm). Barium ions stimulated ADAMTS13 activity in citrated plasma but not in citrate-free plasma. Therefore, the stimulation by barium ions of ADAMTS13 in citrated plasma appears to reflect the release of chelated calcium and zinc ions from complexes with citrate. At optimal zinc and calcium concentrations, ADAMTS13 cleaved VWF with a Km app of 3.7 ± 1.4 μg/ml (∼15 nm for VWF subunits), which is comparable with the plasma VWF concentration of 5–10 μg/ml. ADAMTS13 could cleave ∼14% of VWF pretreated with guanidine HCl, suggesting that this substrate is heterogeneous in susceptibility to proteolysis. ADAMTS13 cleaved FRETS-VWF73 with a Km app of 3.2 ± 1.1 μm, consistent with an ∼200-fold decrease in affinity compared with VWF. ADAMTS13 cleaved VWF and FRETS-VWF73 with roughly comparable catalytic efficiency of 55 μm–1 min–1 and 18 μm–1 min–1, respectively. The striking preference of ADAMTS13 for VWF suggests that substrate recognition depends on structural features or exosites on multimeric VWF that are missing from FRETS-VWF73.

Since the identification of ADAMTS13, evidence has increased concerning the association of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency with the disease thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (4Furlan M. Robles R.

TTP is characterized by disseminated microvascular thrombi containing platelets and multimers of VWF, which is a plasma protein that mediates platelet adhesion by tethering platelets to the extracellular matrix (7Ruggeri Z.M.

In the absence of ADAMTS13 activity, ultra-large multimers of VWF accumulate, causing persistent intravascular platelet aggregation and TTP. Congenital TTP, or Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, is caused by compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene (2Levy G.G. Nichols W.C. Lian E.C. Foroud T. McClintick J.N. McGee B.M.

Many proteinases of the ADAMTS family are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and development, where they typically cleave large multimeric proteins (14Tang B.L. Int. J.

ADAMTS13 regulates the size of plasma VWF multimers by proteolytic cleavage at Tyr1605–Met1606 within the A2 domain of VWF subunits (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B.

ADAMTS proteinases contain a reprolysin-like zinc metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich and spacer region, several thrombospondin type 1 repeats, and variable C termini, which in ADAMTS13 includes two CUB domains (named for the first identified proteins containing this motif, complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1) (17Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The metalloproteinase domain of ADAMTS13 has a putative zinc ion catalytic site (224HEXXHXXGXXHD235), one predicted calcium ion-binding site coordinated by residues Glu83, Asp173, Cys281, and Asp284, and a conserved Met249 that supports the active site zinc ion in a “Met turn”; these features identify ADAMTS13 as a member of the “metzincin” family (1Zheng X.

The role of divalent metal ions in ADAMTS13 activity is not fully understood. Previous studies of ADAMTS13 activity reported that a combination of barium and calcium ions was optimal for cleavage of VWF (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tsai H.-M. Sussman I.I. Ginsburg D. Lankhof H. Sixma J.J. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1997; 89: 1954-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of zinc ions has yielded inconsistent results; some studies found no effect, whereas others found that zinc ions restored the activity of EDTA-treated ADAMTS13 (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tsai H.-M. Sussman I.I. Ginsburg D. Lankhof H. Sixma J.J. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1997; 89: 1954-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, interactions of ADAMTS13 with VWF depend upon ionic strength and pH, but optimal conditions vary considerably among several reports. When assayed at pH 8.0, ADAMTS13 activity was greatest under conditions of low ionic strength (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS13 at low ionic strength (I = 75 mm) in the absence of added metal ions (6Tsai H.M. Lian E.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). The previous studies of ADAMTS13 proteolysis of VWF have established that interactions between the enzyme and substrate are dependent upon metal ions and electrostatic interactions. However, these studies have generally employed reaction conditions unlike those prevailing in vivo. Therefore, the properties of ADAMTS13 were investigated under physiological conditions of pH and ionic strength. The enzyme was found to be activated by calcium and zinc ions at concentrations typical of plasma. Additionally, the Km app for VWF was within the range of plasma VWF concentrations, but the Km app for a synthetic peptide based on the sequence of cleavage site within the VWF A2-domain was ∼210-fold higher. This difference indicates that structural features or exosites within the native multimeric VWF molecule are required for efficient substrate recognition by ADAMTS13. Materials—Aliquots of normal human plasma (American Red Cross, St. Louis, MO) were stored at –20 °C until use. One unit of ADAMTS13 activity was defined as the activity in 1 ml of pooled normal human plasma. The concentration of purified human plasma VWF (Laboratoire Français du Fractionnement et des Biotechnologies, Lille, France, generously provided by Claudine Mazurier) in phosphate-buffered saline was determined by absorbance at 280 nm with absorption coefficient of 1.0 mg ml– cm– and correction for light scattering at 340 nm as described (24Girma J.P.

TRex 293 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with p4TO-ADAMTS13 (1 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% tetracycline-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech or Invitrogen), 300 μg/ml zeocin, 5 μg/ml blasticidin, 2 mm glutamine, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin. Protein expression was initiated in 70–80% confluent roller bottles with 1 μg/ml tetracycline in Freestyle serum-free media (Invitrogen). The media were centrifuged and filtered, and proteinase inhibitors were added (0.1 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (FPR-CK), 0.1 μm Phe-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl (FFR-CK), 144 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The media were concentrated by ultrafiltration on YM30 membranes (Millipore, Inc.) and dialyzed into an appropriate assay buffer. The concentration of recombinant ADAMTS13 was determined by standardization of Western blots with the V5-tagged Positope protein (Invitrogen) as described (25Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The concentration of plasma and recombinant ADAMTS13 also was determined with the ImuBIND ADAMTS13 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (American Diagnostica, Inc.). The concentrations of plasma ADAMTS13 (0.86–0.96 μg/ml) were comparable with those estimated previously (1 μg/ml) (25Zheng X. Nishio K. Majerus E.M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30136-30141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Compared with plasma ADAMTS13 (defined as 100%), the specific activity of recombinant ADAMTS13 was 64% in concentrated conditioned medium and 109% after purification to homogeneity, when assayed with FRETS-VWF73 as described below. 3P. J. Anderson and W. Gao, unpublished observations. ADAMTS13 Assays—Cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 was assessed by Western blotting of the 350-kDa dimer of C-terminal VWF subunit fragments (5Tsai H.M.

Prior to addition, VWF was preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.2 m guanidine HCl. The reaction mixtures contained plasma (0.6 nm) or recombinant ADAMTS13 with various metal ion concentrations in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, in the absence or presence of 10 mm EDTA. Similarly, recombinant ADAMTS13 activity (1 nm) was assessed in mixtures of increasing concentrations of metal ions in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Metal ion stock solutions (50 mm) were prepared in distilled water. Some metal ions required the addition of small amounts of HCl for solubility, specifically ZnCl2. All reported metal ion concentrations represent the total concentration added to reactions. In complete reactions containing buffer, substrate, and plasma, Zn2+ was <2 μm and Ca2+ was <250 μm as determined by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Effects of sodium ions on plasma ADAMTS13 were determined in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.25 mm ZnCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, containing either 150 mm NaCl or 150 mm choline chloride ((2-hydroxyethyl)trimethylammonium chloride), and the effects of ionic strength on plasma ADAMTS13 activity were determined by varying the concentration of NaCl in reaction buffer. The effects of guanidine HCl and urea on the cleavage of VWF were studied by varying the concentration of each chaotropic agent in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of VWF to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml or 2 μg/ml, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were quenched by the addition of sample loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% glycerol (final concentrations)) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4% or 5% gels (Invitrogen or Bio-Rad, respectively). The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting, and the 350-kDa product was detected by Western blotting with a 1:2500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human VWF (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) (26Majerus E.M.

The observed product band densities were quantitated from scanned films using NIH Image 1.61 (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) or by chemifluorescence detected by a STORM Imager and integration of the peaks using ImageQuantTL (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction rates were calculated from the change in band density (ΔDobs/h). The activity with added metal ions was expressed as a ratio to the activity without added metal ions and analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting of the quadratic binding equation, with the maximal change in fold activation (ΔFAmax) and apparent dissociation constant (KD app) as the fitted parameters (27Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The stoichiometric factor (n) and concentration of ADAMTS13 were fixed at 1.0 and 1 nm, respectively. Barium Ion Effects on Citrated and Noncitrated Plasma—Plasma samples were collected from healthy volunteer donors according to a protocol approved by the institutional review board of Washington University School of Medicine. Noncitrated plasma was obtained by collection into 75 μm FPR-CK, 75 μm FFR-CK, 75 μm hirudin (Sigma), and 32 μg/ml corn trypsin inhibitor (Hematologic Technologies, Inc.) (final concentrations) (28Rand M. Lock J. van't Veer C. Gaffney D. Mann K. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The whole blood was centrifuged at 2000 rpm in a Sorvall 6000 for 15 min, and the recovered plasma was inhibited further by adding an additional 75 μm FPR-CK, 75 μm FFR-CK, and 32 μg/ml corn trypsin inhibitor. VWF was predenatured in 5 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.23 m guanidine HCl, for 30 min at 37 °C. ADAMTS13 (0.6 nm) from citrated or noncitrated plasma was incubated with predenatured VWF (2 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of BaCl2 in 5 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 1 h. Effects of barium ions on 30 nm recombinant ADAMTS13 were assessed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and sample loading buffer and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described above. The activation of recombinant ADAMTS13 by barium ions was calculated and expressed as a ratio to the activity in the absence of added metal ions, and the data were fitted to the quadratic binding equation as described above for calcium and zinc ions. The stoichiometric factor (n) and concentration of recombinant ADAMTS13 were fixed at 1 and 30 nm, respectively. Kinetics of VWF Cleavage—The reactions were performed with varying concentrations of VWF with plasma ADAMTS13 (0.6 nm) in assay buffer at 37 °C. The densities of the 350-kDa VWF product band were quantitated as described for metal ion-dependent reactions, and the cleavage rates were calculated as the change in product band density per hour (ΔDobs/h). The rates of product generation as a function of VWF concentration were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine the apparent Michaelis constant (Km app) and maximal observed density (ΔDobs max). Progress curve analysis of VWF proteolysis was determined under first order reaction conditions where the [VWF] was ∼0.5 × Km app. The reactions contained 2 μg/ml VWF and 0.6 nm plasma ADAMTS13, in assay buffer at 37 °C. The 350-kDa VWF product band was detected by chemifluorescence. The area of the product band as a percentage of the total area from each lane as a function of time was calculated by integration of peaks using ImageQuantTL software (Amersham Biosciences). The percentage of area was multiplied by the concentration of substrate in the reaction to determine the concentration of the 350-kDa band. The progress curve of the changes in the 350-kDa VWF product band as a function of time was fit to Equation 1 to obtain the apparent first order rate constant (kobs) and the maximum product generated ([VWF]max), where kobs = E·kcat/Km (29Segel I.H.

Wiley, New York1975: 39-44Google Scholar).[VWF]t=[VWF]max(1-e-kobst)Equation 1 Kinetics of FRETS-VWF73 Cleavage—A peptide containing the cleavage site of ADAMTS13, consisting of Asp1596–Arg1668 of VWF, was synthesized by the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Two amino acids flanking the cleavage site (Gln1599 and Asn1610) were substituted with 2,3-diamino-propionic acid modified with 2-(methylamino)benzoyl and 2,4-dinitrophenol, respectively, as fluorescence resonance energy transfer donor and quencher pairs (30Kokame K. Nobe Y. Kokubo Y. Okayama A. Miyata T. Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 129: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities were measured with a PerkinElmer LS55 using a plate reader accessory in white 96-well plates. Increases in fluorescence intensities (Fobs–Fo = ΔF) were recorded with time using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm (5-nm band pass) and an emission wavelength of 450 nm (5-nm band pass). Various concentrations of substrate were incubated with 0.17 nm plasma ADAMTS13 in assay buffer. FRETS-VWF73 (2 μm) was cleaved to completion (17.5 h) to establish the relationship between product concentration and fluorescence intensity (ΔF). The observed velocities (ΔF/min) as a function of substrate concentration were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain the maximum velocity (Vmax) and the Km app. Nonlinear least squares analyses were performed with Scientist software (Micromath). Cleavage of 2 μm FRETS-VWF73 by 0.3 nm recombinant ADAMTS13 as a function of calcium and zinc ion concentration was assayed similarly in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, except the instrument used was a PerkinElmer Victor2 V plate reader with 340-nm 25-nm bandwidth excitation filter, and 450-nm 10-nm bandwidth emission filter. The errors in the fitted parameters are reported as ±2 S.D. Metal Ion Dependence of ADAMTS13 Activity—Previous studies of ADAMTS13 demonstrated that barium and calcium ions enhanced the rate of proteolysis of VWF (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but these studies employed conditions of pH 8.0 and barium ion concentration (10 mm) that do not occur in vivo. Therefore, the metal ion activation of ADAMTS13 from both plasma and recombinant sources was re-evaluated under more physiological conditions. The interactions of metal ions with plasma ADAMTS13 were characterized by analyzing the changes in the density of the 350-kDa VWF cleavage product by Western blotting. In contrast to previous results (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increasing concentrations of BaCl2 (up to 5 mm) had little effect on the activity of ADAMTS13 at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1). Similarly, Mg(SO4) and Cu(SO4) had little effect on the activity of ADAMTS13 at pH 7.4. Increasing concentrations of CoCl2, Mn(SO4), and Ni(SO4) inhibited ADAMTS13 activity. Calcium ions enhanced the activity by at least ∼3-fold (up to 5 mm). Zinc ions enhanced the activity by at least ∼2-fold (at 1 mm) (Fig. 1). ADAMTS13 activity was undetectable at concentrations of zinc ions above 3 mm, possibly because of inhibition of the enzyme by Zn(OH)+ (31Auld D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 228-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of the susceptible VWF was cleaved in this experiment at the optimal concentrations of CaCl2 or ZnCl2, and the extent of activation by these ions is underestimated slightly because of decreases in substrate concentration during the reaction. Nevertheless, the results indicate that low concentrations of zinc or calcium ions enhance the cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13. To determine the optimal concentration of zinc ions for plasma ADAMTS13 activity, zinc ion concentrations were varied below 250 μm (Fig. 2A). Increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 enhanced the activity of ADAMTS13 by ∼2-fold. (Fig. 2, A and C). The addition of 5 mm CaCl2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 further enhanced the activity of ADAMTS13 by ∼6-fold (Fig. 2, B and C). The ∼6-fold increased activation demonstrated ADAMTS13 proteolysis of VWF to be dependent on both zinc and calcium ions and suggested a cooperative role of the two divalent cations. Partial unfolding of VWF by chaotropic agents such as urea or guanidine HCl is required for rapid cleavage by ADAMTS13 in the absence of fluid shear stress (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tsai H.M. Lian E.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 23Tsai H.-M. Sussman I.I. Ginsburg D. Lankhof H. Sixma J.J. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1997; 89: 1954-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effects of zinc and calcium ions on the proteolysis of VWF under these conditions, VWF was pretreated in varying concentrations of guanidine HCl or urea and then diluted 10-fold into reactions containing ADAMTS13. In the presence of zinc and calcium ions, the optimal concentration of guanidine HCl was between 1.0 and 1.25 m guanidine HCl (initial concentrations) for maximal substrate proteolysis (data not shown), which is similar to previous results (5Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, preincubation of VWF in up to 2 m urea did not accelerate cleavage by ADAMTS13 (data not shown). These results suggest that distinct VWF structures are produced upon incubation with guanidine HCl or urea because the state induced by guanidine HCl persists after dilution, whereas that induced by urea does not. The assays using citrated plasma as a source of ADAMTS13 activity typically contain ∼1 mm citrate (final concentration) (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gerritsen H.E. Turecek P.L. Schwarz H.P. Lammle B. Furlan M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1386-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Citrate chelates a variety of divalent metal ions and could distort the apparent metal dependence of ADAMTS13 by buffering the concentration of zinc and calcium ions. Therefore, the observed effects of these cations on plasma ADAMTS13 were reassessed with recombinant ADAMTS13, which was free of citrate and other metal ion chelators (Fig. 3). Increasing concentrations of zinc ions enhanced the activity of recombinant ADAMTS13 by ∼200-fold, with a KD app of 0.5 ± 0.3 μm. Similarly, increasing concentrations of calcium ions enhanced the activity of recombinant ADAMTS13 by ∼160-fold, with a KD app of 4.8 ± 3.0 μm. The addition of zinc ions to reactions containing near saturating calcium ions (100 μm) further increased ADAMTS13 activity (Fig. 3E). These results indicate a cooperative role for calcium and zinc ions in supporting ADAMTS13 activity. Effects of Barium Ions on ADAMTS13 Activity—Plasma ADAMTS13 activity is enhanced by the addition of barium ions, when reactions are performed using citrate anticoagulated plasma in low ionic strength buffer at pH 8.0 (4Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little or no rate enhancement by barium ions was observed at I = 75 mm and pH 7.4 (Fig. 1), and the ability of citrate to buffer divalent metal ions suggested that the reported barium ion effects might not accurately reflect the properties of ADAMTS13. Therefore, the effect of barium ions was determined using plasma samples that were anticoagulated with sodium citrate or with nonchelating inhibitors (FPR-CK, FFR-CK, hirudin, and corn trypsin inhibitor), and reactions were performed in at low ionic strength (I = 2.5–22.5 mm) such that the citrate concentration was either 1 or 0 mm (Fig. 4A). In the presence of citrate, ADAMTS13 activity was enhanced ∼2-fold by increasing concentrations of barium ions. In the absence of sodium citrate, however, ADAMTS13 activity was not affected by barium ions. Chelation of zinc and calcium ions by citrate also inhibited recombinant ADAMTS13 (Fig. 4B), supporting the conclusion that anticoagulation of plasma by citrate inhibits ADAMTS13. To avoid the confounding effects of zinc and calcium ions in plasma, activation by barium ions was investigated using recombinant ADAMTS13. Barium ions supported ADAMTS13 activity comparable with that achiev"

In insulin-secreting islet β-cells and some other cells, in contrast, iPLA2β signaling functions have been proposed. Using retroviral vectors, we prepared clonal INS-1 β-cell lines in which iPLA2β expression is stably suppressed by small interfering RNA.

The iPLA2β-KD INS-1 cells exhibit impaired insulin secretory responses and reduced proliferation rates. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses of PC and LPC species that accumulate in INS-1 cells cultured with arachidonic acid suggest that 18:0/20:4-glycerophosphocholine (GPC) synthesis involves sn-2 remodeling to yield 16:0/20:4-GPC and then sn-1 remodeling via a 1-lyso/20:4-GPC intermediate. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses also indicate that the PC and LPC content and composition of iPLA2β-KD and control INS-1 cells are nearly identical, as are the rates of arachidonate incorporation into PC and the composition and remodeling of other phospholipid classes. These findings indicate that iPLA2β plays signaling or effector roles in β-cell secretion and proliferation but that stable suppression of its expression does not affect β-cell GPC lipid content or composition even under conditions in which LPC is being actively consumed by conversion to PC.

Another housekeeping function for iPLA2β in PC homeostasis has been proposed from studies of overexpression of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (28Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Cells that overexpress CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase exhibit increased rates of PC biosynthesis and degradation and little net change in PC levels, suggesting that PC degradation is up-regulated to prevent excess PC accumulation. Increased PC degradation in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-overexpressing cells is prevented by BEL, and iPLA2β protein and activity increase, suggesting that iPLA2β is up-regulated (28Baburina I.

https://openalex.org/W2051118571,"To determine the efficacy of cytochrome P450 2C9 metabolites of arachidonic acid, viz. 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), in inducing angiogenesis, we have studied their effects on human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HDMVEC) tube formation and migration. All four EETs stimulated HDMVEC tube formation and migration in a dose-dependent manner. Because 14,15-EET was found to be slightly more efficacious than 5,6-, 8,9-, and 11,12-EETs in stimulating HDMVEC tube formation and migration, we next focused on elucidation of the signaling mechanisms underlying its angiogenic activity. 14,15-EET stimulated Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation in Src- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner in HDMVECs. Inhibition of Src and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling by both pharmacological and dominant-negative mutant approaches suppressed 14,15-EET-induced HDMVEC tube formation and migration in vitro and Matrigel plug angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, 14,15-EET induced the expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in Src- and PI3K-Akt-dependent and mTOR-independent manner in HDMVECs. Neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibodies completely suppressed 14,15-EET-induced HDMVEC tube formation and migration in vitro and Matrigel plug angiogenesis in vivo. Together, these results show for the first time that Src and PI3K-Akt signaling via targeting in parallel with FGF-2 expression and mTOR-S6K1 activation plays an indispensable role in 14,15-EET-induced angiogenesis.

To understand the role of eicosanoids in the development of various types of cancers, we have undertaken a systematic study to identify eicosanoids with potent angiogenic activities and to elucidate the underlying signaling mechanisms. Here, we report that 14,15-EET, the CYP2C9 metabolite of arachidonic acid, stimulates human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HDMVEC) tube formation and migration in vitro and Matrigel plug angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, we present evidence that 14,15-EET-induced HDMVEC tube formation and migration and Matrigel plug angiogenesis require activation of Src and PI3K-Akt signaling via targeting in parallel with FGF-2 expression and mTOR-S6K1 stimulation. Reagents—Aprotinin, dithiothreitol, Drabkin's reagent, HEPES, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium deoxycholate, and sodium orthovanadate were purchased from Sigma. 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs were bought from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel (catalog no. 354250) was obtained from BD Biosciences. LY294002 and PP2 were procured from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-Akt (catalog no. 9271), anti-phospho-S6K1 (catalog no. 9205), and anti-phospho-Src (catalog no. 2101) antibodies and total anti-Akt (catalog no. 9272) and anti-S6K1 (catalog no. 9202) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-FGF-2 antibodies (catalog no. SC-079) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Neutralizing mouse anti-FGF-2 monoclonal antibodies (catalog no. 05-117) and rabbit anti-Src polyclonal antibodies (catalog no. 05-184) were bought from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A human FGF-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (catalog no. DFB50) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rapamycin and wortmannin were bought from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Cell Culture—HDMVECs were bought from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). Cells were grown in endothelial basal medium-2 (catalog no. CC-3156) containing EGM-2 MV SingleQuots (catalog no. CC-4147) (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were quiesced by incubation in endothelial basal medium-2 for 24 h and used to perform the experiments unless stated otherwise. Cell Migration Assay—The migration assay was performed using a modified Boyden chamber method as described by Nagata et al. (35Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The cell culture inserts containing membranes (10-mm diameter and 8.0-μm pore size; Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were placed in a Costar 24-well tissue culture plate (Corning Inc.). The lower surface of the porous membrane was coated with 0.5% gelatin overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37°C. HDMVECs were quiesced for 24 h in endothelial basal medium-2, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, trypsinized, and neutralized with trypsin neutralizing solution (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc.). Cells were seeded onto the upper chamber at 1 × 105 cells/well. Vehicle, EETs, pharmacological inhibitors, or neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibodies were added to the lower chamber at the indicated concentrations. To test the effect of dominant-negative Akt (dnAkt) on 14,15-EET-induced HDMVEC migration, cells were infected first with adenoviral vector expressing either green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) or dnAkt (Ad-dnAkt) at a multiplicity of infection of 80 and quiesced. Quiescent cells were trypsinized, neutralized, and added to the upper chamber at 1 × 105 cells/well. Both the upper and lower chambers contained endothelial basal medium-2. After 8 h of incubation at 37 °C, non-migrated cells were removed from the upper side of the membrane with cotton swabs, and the cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed in methanol for 15 min. The membrane was then stained with Giemsa-Wright stain for 10 min (Sigma) and washed once each with 50 and 100% alcohol. Cells were counted in five randomly selected squares/well under a light microscope (Eclipse 50i, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and presented as the number of migrated cells/field. Matrigel Plug Angiogenesis Assay—The Matrigel plug assay was performed essentially as described by Medhora et al. (27Medhora M. Daniels J. Mundey K. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Jacobs E.R. Harder D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H215-H224Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old) were lightly anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and injected subcutaneously along the dorsal midline with 0.5 ml of Matrigel premixed with vehicle or 50 μm 14,15-EET. The injection was performed rapidly with a BD 26-gauge ½-inch needle to ensure that the entire content was delivered in one plug. Whenever the effects of pharmacological inhibitors, Ad-GFP, Ad-dnAkt, or neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibodies were tested on 14,15-EET-induced angiogenesis, they were added to the Matrigel prior to injection into the mice. The mice were allowed to recover; 7 days later, unless stated otherwise, the animals were killed by inhalation of CO2, and the Matrigel plugs were harvested from underneath the skin. The plugs were homogenized in 1 ml of deionized H2O on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used in duplicate to measure hemoglobin content with Drabkin's reagent along with a hemoglobin standard essentially according to Sigma protocol. The absorbance was read at 540 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices Corp.). These experiments were repeated at least three times with four mice in each group, and the values are expressed as grams of hemoglobin/dl/mg of plug. Tube Formation Assay—The tube formation assay was performed as described by Nagata et al. (35Nagata D. Mogi M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Costar 96-well culture plates (Corning Inc.) were coated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel in a total volume of 20 μl and allowed to solidify for 30 min at 37 °C. HDMVECs were trypsinized, neutralized with trypsin neutralizing solution, and resuspended at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Two-hundred microliters of this cell suspension was added to each well. Vehicle, EETs, pharmacological inhibitors, or neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibodies were added to the appropriate well at the indicated concentrations, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. To test the effect of dnAkt on 14,15-EET-induced HDMVEC tube formation, cells were infected first with either Ad-GFP or Ad-dnAkt at a multiplicity of infection of 80 and quiesced. Quiescent cells were trypsinized, neutralized with trypsin neutralizing solution, and added to the wells at 5 × 104 cells/well. Tube formation was observed under an inverted microscope (Eclipse TS100, Nikon). Images were captured with a Hitachi KP-D20AU CCD color camera attached to the microscope, and the tube length was measured using NIH Image J (Version 1.31). Western Blot Analysis—After appropriate treatments, HDMVECs were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed by thawing in 250 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. After standing on ice for 20 min, the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Viral Vectors—Ad-dnAkt was constructed by Fujio et al. (36Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and was generously provided by Dr. Kenneth Walsh (Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) for use in our experiments. To construct Ad-GFP, the GFP DNA fragment was excised from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) by digestion of the plasmid with SalI and NotI and subcloned into the entry vector pENTR3C (Invitrogen), producing pENTR3C-GFP. pENTR3C-GFP was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and the plasmid was amplified. The plasmid was recombined with pAd/CMV/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer, producing plasmid pAd-GFP, and verified by DNA sequencing. pAd-GFP was linearized with PacI and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293A cells. The resulting adenovirus was further amplified by infection of human embryonic kidney 293A cells and purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation (37Berkner K.L. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 616-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both Ad-GFP and Ad-dnAkt were titrated using a standard plaque assay (37Berkner K.L. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 616-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistics—All experiments were repeated three times with similar results. The data on HDMVEC tube formation and migration and Matrigel plug angiogenesis are presented as the means ± S.D. The treatment effects were analyzed by Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In the case of Western blot analysis, one representative set of data is shown. EETs Induce HDMVEC Tube Formation and Migration—To understand the role of the oxygenative metabolites of arachidonic acid in the development of various types of cancers, we have undertaken a systematic study to identify the eicosanoids with potent angiogenic capacities and to elucidate the underlying signaling events. In this study, we focused on studying the effects of various CYP2C9 metabolites of arachidonic acid, viz. 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs, on angiogenesis using in vitro and in vivo model systems. Quiescent HDMVECs were seeded onto 96-well plates coated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel and treated with vehicle or various concentrations of 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, or 14,15-EET for 6 h, and tube formation was measured. All four EETs stimulated HDMVEC tube formation in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum effect of 2-fold at 0.1 μm (Fig. 1, A and B). Among the four EETs tested, 14,15-EET was found to be slightly more efficacious than 5,6-, 8,9-, and 11,12-EETs in stimulating HDMVEC tube formation. We next determined their effects on HDMVEC migration using a modified Boyden chamber method. Quiescent HDMVECs were added to the upper chamber of the culture inserts that were placed in a 24-well plate, and vehicle or various concentrations of the indicated EET were added to the lower chamber. After incubation at 37 °C for 8 h, the migrated cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed, stained with Giemsa-Wright stain, and counted under a light microscope. Similar to their effects on tube formation, all four EETs induced HDMVEC migration in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum effect of 1.6–3-fold at 0.1 μm (Fig. 1C). Among the four EETs tested, 14,15-EET was found to be slightly more efficacious than the rest of the EETs tested in stimulating HDMVEC migration. At 1.0 μm, none of these EETs caused HDMVEC tube formation or migration. Because 14,15-EET appears to be slightly more efficacious than 5,6-, 8,9-, and 11,12-EETs in stimulating both HDMVEC tube formation and migration, we next focused on investigating the mechanisms of its angiogenic effects. 14,15-EET Activates Akt and S6K1 in HDMVECs—The serine/threonine kinase Akt has been shown to play an important role in mediating angiogenesis in response to various stimulants, including hypoxia and nitric oxide (32Debnath J. Walker S.J. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Kawasaki K. Smith Jr., R.S. Hsieh C.M. Sun J. Chao J. Liao J.K. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31000-31006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that (5S)-HETE, the 5-lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid, stimulates HDMVEC DNA synthesis via activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K1 signaling (38Zeng Z.Z. Yellaturu C.R. Neeli I. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41213-41219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K1 signaling plays a role in angiogenesis induced by 14,15-EET, we studied the time course effect of this eicosanoid on activation of Akt and S6K1 in HDMVECs. Quiescent HDMVECs were treated with vehicle or 0.1 μm 14,15-EET for various time periods, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from the control and each treatment was analyzed for Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation using their phospho-specific antibodies. 14,15-EET stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and S6K1 at Thr421/Ser424 in a time-dependent manner in HDMVECs, with a maximum 3–7-fold effect at 30 min of treatment and decline thereafter, reaching basal levels by 2 h (Fig. 2). To test the role of PI3K in 14,15-EET-stimulated Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation, we studied the effects of its inhibitors, viz. wortmannin and LY294002 (39Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M.

Quiescent HDMVECs were treated with vehicle or 0.1 μm 14,15-EET in the presence and absence of wortmannin (1 μm) or LY294002 (10 μm) for 30 min, and cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation. Wortmannin and LY294002 completely inhibited 14,15-EET-stimulated Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3). These results suggest that Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation stimulated by 14,15-EET is dependent on activation of PI3K. To understand the order in which 14,15-EET activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K1 signaling pathway, we also studied the effect of rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) (41Bierer B.E. Mattila P.S. Standaert R.F. Herzenberg L.A. Burakoff S.J. Crabtree G. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9231-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), which is an immediate downstream effector of Akt and upstream regulator of S6K1 (42von Manteuffel S.R. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, although having no effect on Akt phosphorylation, rapamycin (50 ng/ml) inhibited S6K1 phosphorylation induced by 14,15-EET. These results indicate that 14,15-EET activates PI3K-Akt-mTOR-S6K1 signaling in this order in HDMVECs.FIGURE 3Effect of blockade of PI3K and mTOR on 14,15-EET-induced phosphorylation of Akt and S6K1 in HDMVECs. Quiescent HDMVECs were treated with vehicle or 0.1 μm 14,15-EET in the presence and absence of wortmannin (1 μm), LY294002 (10 μm), or rapamycin (50 ng/ml) for 30 min, and cell extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) from the control and each treatment were analyzed by Western blotting for phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and S6K1 (pS6K1) levels using their phospho-specific antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2140236936,"We described a family of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits underlying cholinergic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis. By using degenerate PCR cloning, we identified 12 subunits that display a high sequence similarity to nAChR subunits, of which 10 are of the α-type, 1 is of the β-type, and 1 was not classified because of insufficient sequence information. Heterologous expression of identified subunits confirms their capacity to form functional receptors responding to acetylcholine. The α-type subunits can be divided into groups that appear to underlie cation-conducting (excitatory) and anion-conducting (inhibitory) channels involved in synaptic cholinergic transmission. The expression of the Lymnaea nAChR subunits, assessed by real time quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization, indicates that it is localized to neurons and widespread in the CNS, with the number and localization of expressing neurons differing considerably between subunit types. At least 10% of the CNS neurons showed detectable nAChR subunit expression. In addition, cholinergic neurons, as indicated by the expression of the vesicular ACh transporter, comprise ∼10% of the neurons in all ganglia. Together, our data suggested a prominent role for fast cholinergic transmission in the Lymnaea CNS by using a number of neuronal nAChR subtypes comparable with vertebrate species but with a functional complexity that may be much higher.

Together, our data suggested a prominent role for fast cholinergic transmission in the Lymnaea CNS by using a number of neuronal nAChR subtypes comparable with vertebrate species but with a functional complexity that may be much higher. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 3The abbreviations used are: nAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptorCNScentral nervous systemLnAChRLymnaea nAChR subunitLGICligand-gated ion channelGABAγ-aminobutyric acidLBDligand-binding domain5-HT5-hydroxytryptaminentnucleotideTMtransmembraneCDCcaudodorsal cellAChacetylcholineAChBPacetylcholine-binding proteinqPCRquantitative PCRLVAChTLymnaea vesicular ACh transporterLYClight yellow cellsLGClight green cellsfwdforwardrevreverseALanterior lobeISHin situ hybridization. belong to the Cys loop family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) together with the 5-HT3, GABA type A/C, and glycine receptors. nAChRs consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane ion channel, and an intracellular domain (1Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), eight α-type (α2–7 and α9–10) and three β-type (β2–4). nAChR subunits have been identified that selectively assemble into nAChR subtypes with different pharmacology, cation conductance, and cellular localization. In the mammalian CNS, nAChRs predominantly mediate presynaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release (for example see Ref. 2Alkondon M. Pereira E.F. Albuquerque E.X. Brain Res. 1998; 810: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and are to a limited extent involved in direct, fast synaptic transmission (for example see Refs. 3Grady S.R. Meinerz N.M.

Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the molluscan CNS, the mode of fast synaptic cholinergic transmission seems to prevail. The CNS of the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis consists of ∼20,000 large and identifiable neurons, of which many were shown to express functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (8Zeimal E.V. Vulfius C.A. Salanki J. Neurobiology of Invertebrates. Academiai Kiado, Budapest, Hungary1967: 255-265Google Scholar, 9Vulfius E.A. Veprintzev B.N. Zeimal E.V. Michelson M.J. Nature. 1967; 216: 400-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In particular, in well described neuronal networks, various nAChR subtypes were shown to mediate synaptic transmission (10Yeoman M.S. Parish D.C. Benjamin P.R. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Woodin M.A. Munno D.W. Syed N.I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 505-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uniquely, molluscs possess excitatory and inhibitory nAChR subtypes conducting cations and anions, respectively (9Vulfius E.A. Veprintzev B.N. Zeimal E.V. Michelson M.J. Nature. 1967; 216: 400-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12Chiarandini D.J. Gerschenfeld H.M. Science. 1967; 156: 1595-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Chiarandini D.J.

Lett. 2005; 373: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Also, different excitatory and inhibitory nAChR subtypes mediate cholinergic transmission at single identified synapses, the differential contribution of which is regulated by soluble extracellular factors (11Woodin M.A. Munno D.W. Syed N.I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 505-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hamakawa T. Woodin M.A. Bjorgum M.C. Painter S.D. Takasaki M. Lukowiak K. Nagle G.T. Syed N.I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, functionally identified neurons in the Lymnaea CNS are a valuable model to explore nAChR function and diversity related to signal transmission in the nervous system. The lack of molecular information on nAChRs in molluscs, however, prevents a comprehensive analysis of cholinergic transmission. To address this issue, we identified nAChR subunits in the Lymnaea CNS, and we assessed their cellular expression by in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR. Our data underscore the postulated widespread role for fast cholinergic excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the Lymnaea CNS, involving a number of nAChR subtypes that are comparable with vertebrate species but with a functional complexity that may be much higher. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor central nervous system Lymnaea nAChR subunit ligand-gated ion channel γ-aminobutyric acid ligand-binding domain 5-hydroxytryptamine nucleotide transmembrane caudodorsal cell acetylcholine acetylcholine-binding protein quantitative PCR Lymnaea vesicular ACh transporter light yellow cells light green cells forward reverse anterior lobe in situ hybridization. Animals—Adult L. stagnalis (shell length, 28–34 mm) bred under laboratory standard conditions (17van der Steen W.J. van der Hoven N.P. Jager J.C. Neth. J. Zool. 1969; 19: 131-139Crossref Google Scholar) were used. PCR Using Degenerate Oligonucleotides—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) from freshly dissected CNS or from pooled LPeD1 (10×), RPeD1 (10×), and VD4 (6×) neurons with axons attached and isolated by mechanical suction from Lymnaea brain ganglia. For CNS preparations, mRNA was isolated using (dT)26-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). RNA was reverse-transcribed using hexanucleotide primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). 3′- and 5′-directed degenerate oligonucleotides (Isogen Bioscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were synthesized with an EcoRI or HindIII restriction site, respectively, at the 5′-ends. The 5′-directed oligonucleotides include the following: primer 1, 5′-cgggaattcaaytayaaymmiytigarmgnccngt-3′; primer 2, 5′-cggaattccarathhtigaygtigaygaraaraayca-3′; primer 5, 5′-cggaattcaarttyggiwsitggwsitaysrngg-3′; primer 7a, 5′-aagaattccngayrtistictitayaayaaygcnga-3′; primer 7b, 5′-aagaattccngayrtnstictitayaaywsigcnga-3′.

Primer combinations were used on a CNS-derived cDNA (≥1 CNS equivalent) or on cDNA templates of identified neurons (0.12 cell equivalent for VD4 and 0.20 cell equivalent for LPeD1/RPeD1) in an initial PCR (40 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s; 54 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 90 s) using a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nested primers were used in a subsequent PCR (40 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s; 54 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 90 s) using 1/50th of the initial PCR as template. Amplified cDNA products were separated on 2% agarose gels, and generated products of expected sizes were excised, digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and cloned. For each independent PCR, several cloned products were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. Full-length Cloning—The cDNA of an amplified λZAPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cDNA library of the CNS of L. stagnalis was isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Nested oligonucleotide primer sets (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) were designed based on partial PCR-derived nAChR subunit sequences. These primer sets were used together with nested λZAPII primer sets T33 (5′-gcgcaattaaccctcactaaagg-3′) and EV3 (5′-agcggataacaattttcacacagga-3′) or T77 (5′-gcgtaatacgactcactatagggcgc-3′) and EV2 (5′-cgccagggtttttcccagtcacgac-3′) in consecutive PCRs with identical parameters (40 cycles: 94 °C for 30 s; 58 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 210 s) using Advantage DNA polymerase (Clontech). DNA was separated on 1% agarose gels, and PCR products corresponding to 3′ (≥1000 bp) or 5′ (≥500 bp) parts were excised, cloned, and sequenced. Translation initiation sites were predicted using SMART (18Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Final sequences were obtained by sequencing three independently generated PCR products generated on dT-primed cDNA of pooled Lymnaea CNS. For Xenopus oocyte expression, cDNAs of open reading frames were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Sequences of cloned products were checked by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. Sequences of cloned products were checked by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. GenBank™ data base accession numbers for the sequences are as follows: LnAChR A, DQ167344; LnAChR B, DQ167345; LnAChR C, DQ167346; LnAChR D, DQ167347; LnAChR E, DQ167348; LnAChR F, DQ167349; LnAChR G, DQ167350; LnAChR H, DQ167351; LnAChR I, DQ167352; LnAChR J, DQ167354; LnAChR K, DQ167353; and LnAChR L, DQ167355. Sequence Analysis—Protein alignments were performed with ClustalX (19Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35491) Google Scholar). Secondary structure elements of deduced protein sequences were predicted using SMART (18Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Biologically active sites were predicted from the Prosite data base using ScanProsite (20Sigrist C.J. Cerutti L. Hulo N. Gattiker A. Falquet L. Pagni M. Bairoch A. Bucher P. Brief. Bioinform. 2002; 3: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 21Gattiker A. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Appl. Bioinformatics. 2002; 1: 107-108PubMed Google Scholar). Probability of phosphorylation sites was analyzed by using NetPhos 2.0 (22Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis was performed by ClustalX using the neighbor-joining method (Kimura correction). Regions of weak alignment (corresponding to residues 13–15, 166–167, 298–434, and 460–462 of LnAChR A) were excluded from the analysis. Electrophysiology—Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared, injected, and recorded as described previously (23Bertrand D. Ballivet M. Rungger D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1993-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Drugs were applied in the bath by rapid superfusion that was controlled by electromagnetic valves. Drugs and chemicals were purchased either from Sigma or Fluka. Current-voltage relationships (I-V curves) were determined either by holding the cell at a fixed potential and measuring the ACh-evoked current or by voltage ramps (from -100 to + 80 mV in 2 s) applied during the ACh response. I-V plots were obtained by reporting the amplitude of the current as a function of the holding voltage after subtraction of the passive cell properties determined in absence of the agonist. Real Time Quantitative PCR—RNA of the complete CNS, individual ganglia, and body tissues was isolated as described above followed by a DNase I (10 units; Roche Applied Science) treatment, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. cDNA was made using hexanucleotides (300 pmol) and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus H-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA from pooled VD4 (6×) and LPeD1 (6×) neurons, cultured for 18 h, was isolated, and hexanucleotide-primed cDNA was transcribed according to van Minnen and van Kesteren (24van Minnen J. van Kesteren R. Windhorst U. Johansson H. Modern Techniques in Neuroscience Research. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1999: 57-88Crossref Google Scholar). All cDNAs were ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 60 μl of aquadest. Transcript-specific primers were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to generate 70–120-bp amplicons as follows: LnAChR A fwd, 5′-gctaggaatgacctggaatgc-3′, and LnAChR A rev, 5′-ggaacccacaccatctgctta-3′; LnAChR B fwd, 5′-tccagtttcgctacccagatg-3′, and LnAChR B rev, 5′-gcgttggactcgacgatgt-3′; LnAChR C fwd, 5′-tgactcaacgtggtgtgcaa-3′, and LnAChR C rev, 5′-aaccccaatgattccatgga-3′; LnAChR D fwd, 5′-cagaatggaccgaccagaaa-3′, and LnAChR D rev, 5′-cgacaaggtattctgagccgttt-3′; LnAChR E fwd, 5′-cgcggtcaagaacattcga-3′, and LnAChR E rev, 5′-acggtgtggaacagggtcttt-3′; LnAChR F fwd, 5′-atcctggatgtggacgtcaaa-3′, and LnAChR F rev, 5′-cacgtccgaccaagtatattcgt-3′; LnAChR G fwd, 5′-ggctttcaggtggacataacg-3′, and LnAChR G rev, 5′-tcaccgctgaacacgtagttc-3′; LnAChR H fwd, 5′-tctcaggctgtctggcgtaca-3′, and LnAChR H rev, 5′-cagatcccgcatcagtcttga-3′; LnAChR I fwd, 5′-agtggatgccccaagctattc-3′, and LnAChR I rev, 5′-ggtccacgagccaaacttaagc-3′; LnAChR J fwd, 5′-gctgaacgctcctcacattct-3′, and LnAChR J rev, 5′-tcgagcaacccttggatga-3′; LnAChR K fwd, 5′-ccctttcgacatccaaaattg-3′, and LnAChR K rev, 5′-accgtccatgctcagtaccat-3′; LnAChR L fwd, 5′-ttgacaacaaacggttggttaaat-3′, and LnAChR L rev, 5′-aatggcaacctcaggaccttt-3′; LEFa fwd, 5′-accacaactggccacttgatc-3′, and LEFa rev, 5′-ccatctcttgggcctctttct-3′; Ltub fwd, 5′-caagcgcatctctgagcagtt-3′, and Ltub rev, 5′-tggattccgcctctgtgaa-3′; and LVAChT fwd, 5′-cgaactgtgagattggtttgatg-3′, and LVAChT rev, 5′-tcaccctctgttgtttccataactt-3′. Quality testing of primers and qPCRs were performed as described earlier (25Spafford J.D. Munno D.W. van Nierop P. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Gallin W.J. Smit A.B. Zamponi G.W. Syed N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4258-4267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ct values were used to calculate the relative expression level (Ct,norm) normalized to Lymnaea β-tubulin (Ltub; GenBank™ accession number X15542) or Lymnaea elongation factor α (LEFα; GenBank™ accession number DQ278441). For gene x, the Ct,normgenex is calculated as follows: Ct,genex - Ct,Ltub. These values were transformed to yield linear expression levels for each sample by Pe-Ct,normgenex, where P is the amplification efficiency of the primer set. For each set, the amplification efficiency was determined once on serial template dilutions. Normalized linear gene expression levels from replicate measurements were expressed as the mean ± S.E. On preparations of CNS, ganglia, and neuronal population, expression of all transcripts was detected with the highest Ct, value (lowest abundance) measured at least six cycles (factor 32) below the no-template control. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (26Koert C.E. Spencer G.E. van Minnen J. Li K.W. Geraerts W.P. Syed N.I. Smit A.B. van Kesteren R.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5597-5606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific [32P]UTP-labeled RNA probes were transcribed from linearized cDNA (200 ng) corresponding to stretches of coding sequence of LnAChR A (nts 1039–1380), B (nts 1096–1470), C (nts 1035–1395), D (nts 1011–1556), E (nts 895–1472), F (nts 986–1357), G (nts 1341–1767), H (nts 909–1293), I (nts 1209–1523), J (nts 894–1503), K (nts 959–1386), L (nucleotides gtccgccaagaattttggc in 5′-untranslated region-365), and LVAChT (nts 1–407; GenBank™ accession number AF484093). In situ hybridization (ISH) probes for nAChR subunits were designed to minimize cross-hybridization and, where possible, target regions that encode the intracellular TM3–TM4-connecting loop that has a very low degree of sequence conservation. Identification of nAChR Subunits from the CNS of L. stagnalis—For the identification of nAChR subunits, we performed a nested PCR using degenerate primers on various CNS-derived cDNA templates (Table 1A). Sequencing of amplified DNA identified 13 different sequences that each showed similarity to a region of the LBD of nAChR subunits (see also Fig. 1). In addition, two sequences representing partial Lymnaea nAChR subunits were available from previous hybridization screening of a λ phage CNS cDNA library for nAChR subunit-related sequences 4E. Vreugdenhil and A. B. Smit, unpublished data. and from an ongoing Lymnaea CNS EST sequencing project (L. L. Moroz, University of Florida) (Table 1B). Full-length sequence information of the partial sequences was obtained by PCR cloning using a Lymnaea CNS cDNA library. In total, 12 individual transcripts were identified that were named Lymnaea nAChR subunits (LnAChR) A–L (Fig. 1). A full-length sequence for LnAChR L could not be obtained. For LnAChR F, a splice variant was identified yielding sequence diversity in the long intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4. The alternatively spliced region in LnAChR F contains a predicted protein kinase C phosphorylation site (NetPhos score 0.948) (Fig. 1).TABLE 1Cloning strategy of Lymnaea nAChR subunits A, Lymnaea nAChR subunits were identified by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides in two consecutive rounds of amplification on various cDNA templates. Products generated by these reactions correspond to three regions of the LGIC LBD, referred to as regions A, B, and C (see also Fig. 1), and were named accordingly. Partial products A3 and C4, C1 and B2, and B1 and C3 represented partial sequences of single RNA transcripts. B, partial LnAChR sequences X1 and X2 were obtained from a phage-library screen4 and an EST sequencing project (L. L. Moroz, University of Florida). Open table in a new tab With BLAST analysis each of the 12 deduced protein sequences share highest similarity with predicted as well as with functionally characterized nAChR subunits (data not shown). Sequence comparison with human LGIC subunits indicates the highest identity with nAChR subunits (Fig. 2C). Previously described Lymnaea GABA receptor subunits (27Harvey R.J. Vreugdenhil E. Zaman S.H.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) do not show significant sequence identity with the identified protein sequences. All identified proteins possess four predicted transmembrane domains (TMs) with a relative spacing (three TMs at the center and one TM at the C terminus) that are similar to the organization observed in nAChR subunits. Moreover, the subunits contain two cysteine residues separated by 13 amino acids (Fig. 1), which are features characteristic for proteins belonging to the so-named Cys loop family of LGICs. Together, these results support the classification of the identified sequences as Lymnaea nAChR subunits. Because of the presence of the typical vicinal Cys residues in the loop C region of the principal component of ligand binding, LnAChR A–I and LnAChR K are classified as α-type nAChR subunits, and because of the absence of these Cys residues, LnAChR J is classified as β-type subunit. Most interestingly, in loop C the LnAChR H subunit shows an unusual His-X-Cys-Cys-X-X-X-Tyr motif rather than the conserved Tyr-X-Cys-Cys-X-X-X-Tyr. Sequence Comparison of Lymnaea nAChR Subunits—Of all identified subunits, LnAChR F and I share the highest level of sequence identity (69% identity), whereas LnAChR H and K share the lowest level (25% identity) (Table 2A). For comparison, human nAChR subunits share sequence identity values of 35–84% (data not shown). LnAChR E shares the highest sequence identity with the α2 and α4 nAChR subunits (62%), whereas the lowest identity is found for LnAChR H and the human β2 subunit with only 24% identical residues (Table 2B).TABLE 2Protein sequence identity of Lymnaea and rat nAChR subunits A, distance matrix of sequence identity (%) of aligned LnAChR subunits and Lymnaea AChBP (GenBank™ accession number P58154). B, distance matrix of identity scores (%) of aligned LnAChR and human nAChR subunits. The long intracellular loop was excluded from comparison. Dark and light boxes indicate the highest and lowest scores for each LnAChR subunit, respectively.* Data analyzed on partial sequence Open table in a new tab * Data analyzed on partial sequence Based on sequence relatedness (Table 2A), we defined three group of LnAChR subunits each with >60% inter-sequence identity, group B, I, and F, group C and E, and group D and G (Fig. 2A). None of the LnAChR subunits LBD domains displays a particular homology to AChBP, a molluscan protein secreted by glial cells homologous to the nAChR LBD (29Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 30Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). AChBP shares the highest sequence identity (27%) with the LnAChR K subunit (see Table 2A). The groups of subunits that include LnAChR H, the LnAChR B, F, I, and K, and the LnAChR D and G subunits branch off between human 5-HT3 receptors and nAChR subunits (Fig. 2C). Based on phylogeny, LnAChR H seems as distant from 5-HT3 subunits as it is from nAChR subunits. Most interestingly, LnAChR A displays a clear relation to the vertebrate α7 subunit that forms homopentameric receptors, whereas LnAChR J, C, and E are more related to subunits known to assemble into heteropentameric nAChRs. Functional Expression of LnAChRs in Xenopus Oocytes—To determine the contribution of LnAChR subunits to functional receptors, we expressed LnAChR subunits in X. laevis oocytes. As a first step, LnAChR subunits were expressed individually allowing for only homopentameric nAChR subtypes to be formed. Expression of functional receptors was observed with LnAChR A or B subunits and with LnAChR I subunits (Fig. 3A). Oocytes that express the LnAChR A or B subunits responded to application of ACh but not to application of 5-HT (Fig. 3, B and C), glutamate, GABA, or glycine (data not shown). Receptors composed of LnAChR A or B subunits are sensitive to typical nicotinic agonists (i.e. nicotine and choline) and antagonists (i.e. methyllycaconitine, dihydro-β-erythroidine, α-bungarotoxin, and α-conotoxin-ImI) (57van Nierop P. Keramidas A. Bertrand S. van Minnen J. Gouwenberg Y. Bertrand D. Smit A.B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10617-10626Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although recorded currents are smaller, oocytes expressing the LnAChR I subunit respond equally to ACh or 5-HT applications (Fig. 3D). LnAChR I receptors are also insensitive to glutamate, GABA, and glycine (data not shown). The failure of many subunits to express as functional receptors as well as the small size of the currents mediated by receptors composed of the LnAChR I subunit suggests that additional subunits are required for functional expression. As a second step, subunit combinations were selected based on the inferred subunit classification and similarity of expression levels in the CNS (see Fig. 5). Co-expression of the β-type LnAChR J subunit with other subunits, including those resembling most the α-subunits found in mammalian neuronal nAChRs (LnAChR C or E), did not result in functional channels. Moreover, no currents could be observed with subunits combinations, including both LnAChR F and H that represent the most abundant subunits in the CNS (see below). Finally, responses of oocytes that co-expressed LnAChRI with LnAChRF or -J could not be distinguished from those of oocytes expressing LnAChR I alone, suggesting LnAChR I does not co-assemble into pentamers with these subunits (data not shown). To assess the ionic selectivity of the receptors, I-V curves were determined (see “Materials and Methods”) in normal or low chloride concentration. As shown in Fig. 3E, reduction of the chloride concentration caused no major change of the reversal potential in LnAChR A (-13 to -20 mV). In opposition, a large shift of 49 ± 1.5 mV (n = 3) was observed when the same experiment was repeated with LnAChR B receptors, which suggests that the current flowing through these receptors is mainly carried by chloride ions (Fig. 3F). Receptors composed of LnAChR I display comparable characteristics of chloride-selective channels (data not shown). We therefore conclude that LnAChR A contributes to cation-selective receptors, whereas LnAChR B and I contribute to anion-selective receptors. Expression of LnAChR Subunits in the Lymnaea CNS—The distribution and level of expression of LnAChR subunits was analyzed using ISH and real time qPCR, respectively. qPCR analysis on cDNA templates derived from various tissues and organs showed that LnAChR subunits are expressed almost exclusively in the CNS (Fig. 4). In the CNS the transcripts for the identified LnAChR subunits are exclusively found in neurons as shown by ISH (see Fig. 6). Expression was absent in non-neuronal cells in the CNS (glia and connective tissue) and in remnants of striated muscle included in the CNS tissue sections. We therefore concluded that all identified Lymnaea nAChR subunits are neuronal nAChR subunits.FIGURE 6Expression of LnAChR subunits and LVAChT in the Lymnaea CNS. The expression of LnAChR subunits and of the LVAChT in the central ring ganglia of the Lymnaea CNS was investigated using qPCR and ISH. Each graph (A–VAChT) indicates the relative expression levels in the different ganglia as determined by qPCR under Fig. 5. The drawings provide an overview of the location and the intensity of labeled neurons observed with ISH; please note the number of spheres does not correspond to the exact number of neurons. The photographs show examples of labeled neurons (black outlined arrowheads) obtained with ISH on serial sections of the Lymnaea CNS. With the LVAChT, the identified RPeD1 neuron (white outlined arrowhead) was found unlabeled. Scale bars represent 100 μm.

https://openalex.org/W2120394513,"Apoptin, a chicken anemia virus-derived protein, selectively induces apoptosis in transformed but not in normal cells, thus making it a promising candidate as a novel anticancer therapeutic. The mechanism of apoptin-induced apoptosis is largely unknown. Here, we report that contrary to previous assumptions, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit apoptin-induced cell death in several tumor cell lines. In contrast, deficiency of Bax conferred resistance, whereas Bax expression sensitized cells to apoptin-induced death. Cell death induction by apoptin was associated with cytochrome c release from mitochondria as well as with caspase-3 and -7 activation. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, was highly protective against apoptin-induced cell death. Apoptosis induced by apoptin required Apaf-1, as immortalized Apaf-1-deficient fibroblasts as well as tumor cells devoid of Apaf-1 were strongly protected. Thus, our data indicate that apoptin-induced apoptosis is not only Bcl-2- and caspase dependent, but also engages an Apaf-1 apoptosome-mediated mitochondrial death pathway."

Molybdenum cofactor insertion is a tightly controlled process that involves specific interactions between the proteins that promote cofactor delivery, enzyme-specific chaperones, and the apoenzyme. In the assembly pathway of the multisubunit molybdoenzyme, membrane-bound nitrate reductase A from Escherichia coli, a NarJ-assisted molybdenum cofactor (Moco) insertion step, must precede membrane anchoring of the apoenzyme. Here, we have shown that the NarJ chaperone interacts at two distinct binding sites of the apoenzyme, one interfering with its membrane anchoring and another one being involved in molybdenum cofactor insertion. The presence of the two NarJ-binding sites within NarG is required to ensure productive formation of active nitrate reductase. Our findings supported the view that enzyme-specific chaperones play a central role in the biogenesis of multisubunit molybdoenzymes by coordinating subunits assembly and molybdenum cofactor insertion.

Molybdoenzyme biogenesis, the process that ensures productive formation of active molybdoenzymes, generally involves both metal cofactor insertion and multisubunit assembly. In prokaryotes, the Moco insertion process is a cytoplasmic post-translational event (9Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Muller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F.

Dissimilatory nitrate reductase A from Escherichia coli (NarGHI) is one of the best studied multisubunit molybdoenzymes (14Blasco F. Guigliarelli B. Magalon A. Asso M. Giordano G. Rothery R.A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and can be considered as a model system for studying the biogenesis process in prokaryotic enzymes. NarGHI is a heterotrimeric enzyme comprising a Moco and an iron-sulfur-containing catalytic subunit (NarG, 139 kDa), an iron-sulfur-containing subunit (NarH, 58 kDa) and a quinol-oxidizing membrane-bound heme b subunit (NarI, 26 kDa) (14Blasco F.

Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar). NarGH is located in the cytoplasm, anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by NarI. When liberated from the membrane, the NarGH complex retains its activity using artificial electron donors such as benzyl viologen. Finally, the enzyme-specific chaperone NarJ plays an essential role for nitrate reductase A activity, facilitating Moco insertion into NarG (11Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C.

This observation suggests that the subunit assembly and the Moco incorporation must be tightly coordinated. Such coordination has been shown using the membrane-bound nitrate reductase from Thermus thermophilus. Indeed, the NarJ-assisted Moco insertion step can only occur once the apoenzyme complex is attached to the cytoplasmic membrane (22Zafra O. Cava F. Blasco F. Magalon A. Berenguer J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3990-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this work, we have provided new insights about molybdoenzyme biogenesis in E. coli. We have revealed a novel function for the enzyme-specific chaperone NarJ that goes beyond its reported implication in the Moco incorporation process. Our results demonstrated that NarJ interacts at two distinct binding sites on the NarG subunit within the apoenzyme complex, one interfering with membrane anchoring and another being involved in Moco insertion. Overall, the enzyme-specific NarJ protein coordinates assembly and molybdenum cofactor acquisition of the heterotrimeric enzyme during the biogenesis process. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The E. coli strains and plasmids used in this work are described in Table 1. BL21(DE3) was employed for protein overexpression using pET22b-type expression plasmids (Novagen). BTH101 was used as recipient strain for two-hybrid assays. In-frame deletion of narJ was performed according to the Hamilton procedure (23Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mob,narJ double mutant strain was obtained by P1 transduction as described before (15Rothery R.A. Blasco F. Magalon A. Weiner J.H. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial cultures were grown aerobically in L-broth medium at 37 °C. For biochemical studies, strains were grown anaerobically in L-broth medium supplemented with glucose (0.3%) and nitrate (0.2%). When required, the appropriate antibiotics and 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside were added.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidDescriptionReferenceStrainsMC4100F– araD139 (argF-lac)U169 rpsL150 relA1 deoC1 flb-5301 ptsF1Laboratory collectionLCB3064nar25(narGH), narZ::W, Δnap, thi-1, leu-6, thr-1, rpsL175, lacY, KanR, SpcRJ.

Conversely, pT18-NarG-(1-40) plasmid expresses the first 40 amino acids of NarG fused to the N terminus of the T18 domain of adenylate cyclase. Bacterial Two-hybrid Assay—Protein interactions were detected using a bacterial two-hybrid approach as described previously (24Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol.

Protein interactions were estimated by measurement of β-galactosidase activity in cells grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C in L-broth medium supplemented with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell Fractionation—Cells were cultured anaerobically as indicated above, harvested at late exponential phase, and washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2 buffer (buffer A). The cells were used immediately or stored as pellets at -20 °C until required. Bacterial cells were broken by passage through a French press. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g to remove any unbroken cells. The crude extract obtained (CE) was diluted 5-fold with buffer A and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 90 min. The cell supernatant and the membrane fraction were again centrifuged for 90 min at 250,000 × g, yielding the soluble (S) and membrane (M) fractions. Immunological Quantitation—The amount of nitrate reductase antigen present in cell fractions was quantified by performing rocket immunoelectrophoresis analysis using a polyclonal antiserum specific for nitrate reductase A as described previously (26Graham A. Boxer D.H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Activation of Nitrate Reductase in Crude Cell Extracts—The MobA-dependent activation of nitrate reductase was based on that described previously (10Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The specified quantities of purified MobA-His6 protein were added to 100 μl of crude extract; the volume of the reaction medium was adjusted to 150 μl with buffer A. The NarJ-dependent activation experiment was performed using the same procedure by adding specified quantities of purified NarJ-His6 (11Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this work, in vitro activation of nitrate reductase precursors present in crude extracts was only considered to avoid a time-dependent inactivation of the sample occurring during cell fractionation. The assay mixtures were incubated under strictly anaerobic conditions in a glove box (95% N2, 5% H2) at 37 °C for 90 min and placed on ice to stop the reaction. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were assayed for nitrate reductase activity. Enzyme Assays—Nitrate reductase activity in cell fractions was measured at 37 °C by following the oxidation of reduced benzyl viologen spectrophotometrically at 600 nm coupled to the reduction of potassium nitrate (27Jones R.W. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Nitrate reductase specific activity is expressed in μmol of nitrite produced min-1 mg-1 of nitrate reductase as detected by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Overexpression and Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—MobA-His6 was purified as described (28Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Overexpression of NarJ-His6 was performed as described previously (11Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Soluble fractions were prepared as described above using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole buffer (binding buffer) and applied to a 4-ml Ni2+ affinity column (Qiagen) equilibrated with the binding buffer. After washing the column, the NarJ-His6 protein was eluted using binding buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole. The pooled fractions were immediately dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m NaCl buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until used. The whole procedure was carried out at 4 °C. Interaction Study by Biosensor Experiments—The surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore apparatus) was used to analyze the interaction between NarJ and NarG variants. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. NarJ-His6 was purified as indicated above and immobilized on a sensor chip CM5 (BIAcore) through amine coupling as described previously (11Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Crude extracts (70 ml at 50 mg of total protein/ml) containing NarG variants were prepared in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) and injected over the test and control (no protein immobilized) surfaces at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The sensor surface was regenerated with a 1-min injection of 1 mm NaOH. NarJ Maintains the Aponitrate Reductase in a Soluble State before Moco Insertion—Enzyme-specific chaperones interact with the apoenzyme early during the maturation process. The apoenzyme acquires thereby a conformation suitable for subsequent incorporation of the metal cofactor (29Kuchar J. Hausinger R.P. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the same way, NarJ attachment to the aponitrate reductase is a prerequisite for Moco incorporation (11Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Vergnes A. Gouffi-Belhabich K. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41398-41403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the case of the nitrate reductase from T. thermophilus, it has been demonstrated that NarJ-assisted Moco incorporation occurs within the membrane-bound apoenzyme complex. Further, NarJ is required for membrane attachment of the thermophilic apoenzyme complex (22Zafra O. Cava F. Blasco F. Magalon A. Berenguer J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3990-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the cellular distribution of the apoenzyme from E. coli is influenced by its interaction with NarJ (Fig. 1). Initially, the absence of NarJ did not appear to affect the cellular distribution of the apoenzyme; the apoenzyme produced by a narJ strain was mainly associated with the membrane fraction as in the wild-type parent (Fig. 1). However, in a mob mutant in which Moco biosynthesis is arrested, chromosomal or plasmidic expression of NarJ increased significantly the amount of soluble enzyme. Although only 15% of soluble apoenzyme was found in the mob,narJ strain, nearly 40 and 80% were present in the mob and in mob/pNarJ strains, respectively. Conversely, in a Moco-sufficient strain (WT), overexpression of NarJ did not affect the localization of the holonitrate reductase. Thus, before Moco insertion, the NarJ chaperone maintains the apoenzyme in a soluble state. NarJ-assisted Moco Insertion Step Precedes Membrane Anchoring of the Apoenzyme—We next asked whether the NarJ-driven modification of apoenzyme distribution influences the NarJ-assisted Moco incorporation process. To address this point, we followed Moco insertion using in vitro activation assays on crude extracts from strains displaying either mostly soluble or membrane-bound aponitrate reductases (Fig. 2). Initially, in vitro MobA-dependent activation assays were performed using mob or mob/pNarJ strains expressing 40 and 80% of soluble apoenzyme, respectively. Interestingly, the highest activity value was obtained with the strain mob/pNarJ that expressed a mainly soluble apoenzyme (Fig. 2A). In a different set of experiments, in vitro NarJ-dependent activation assays were performed using a nar strain transformed with a plasmid expressing either the soluble NarGH complex or the membrane-associated NarGHI complex (Fig. 2B). Here again, the highest level of activation was observed with the nar/pNarGH extract displaying 80% of soluble apoenzyme in contrast to the nar/pNarGHI displaying 20% of soluble enzyme. In both approaches, the higher level of soluble apoenzyme in the crude extracts resulted in a higher level of activation. Further, as seen in Fig. 2, the highest activity values were obtained with extracts in which the apoenzyme had interacted in vivo with NarJ (mob strain) as compared with the cases in which NarJ has been added in vitro (nar derivatives). This is in full agreement with the reported chaperone function of NarJ i.e. apoenzyme stabilization (31Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since maintaining the apoenzyme in a soluble state improved the yield of activation, we next asked whether, once solubilized, the membrane-bound apoenzyme can be activated in vitro. Solubilization by Triton X-100 did not improve the in vitro activation level of the mob crude extract in which 60% of the apoenzyme is membrane-bound (data not shown). As a control, Triton X-100 addition to a mob/pNarJ extract in which the apoenzyme is mainly soluble did not inhibit the level of activation. These results indicated that, despite solubilization, the membrane-bound apoenzyme can no longer incorporate Moco. Taken together, these results clearly indicated that (i) the apoenzyme maintained in a soluble state by NarJ in a mob strain is in a competent conformation for Moco insertion and (ii) once bound to the NarI subunit, the apoNarGH complex has acquired a definitive conformation that is no longer compatible with a NarJ-assisted Moco insertion process. Moco incorporation is apparently a cytoplasmic event that must take place at a particular stage of nitrate reductase biogenesis before membrane attachment of the apoenzyme. Evidence for Two NarJ-binding Sites on the NarG Precursor—We showed that NarJ maintains the apoNarGH complex in a soluble state. One explanation could be that NarJ interferes with membrane anchoring of the apoenzyme. Previous studies from this laboratory indicated that NarJ specifically interacts with the catalytic subunit NarG within the apoenzyme complex (11Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the NarGHI complex reveals that both NarG and NarH subunits associate with NarI, the membrane-anchor subunit (Fig. 3) (20Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). A major interaction with NarI centers on the N-terminal tail of NarG. Such an extended domain of NarG would constitute a good candidate for NarJ binding in terms of membrane-anchoring interference. To verify this hypothesis, the region extending between Met-1 and Gln-40 (Fig. 3) was fused to the N terminus of the T18 domain of the adenylate cyclase and tested for NarJ interaction in the two-hybrid system. Remarkably, the fusion strongly interacts with NarJ (Fig. 4A). As reported before, the NarJ-NarG protein interaction can also be followed using BIAcore (11Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). NarJ protein was thus immobilized and tested for its interaction with the NarG-(1-40)-T18 fusion protein. As compared with the sensorgram obtained with a nar extract (nar/pT18-Zip), NarJ appears to specifically interact with the N-terminal tail of NarG (Fig. 4B). As a positive control, an extract containing the full-length NarG fused to the T18 domain showed specific interaction with NarJ.FIGURE 4Evidence for two NarJ-binding sites within NarG. A, interactions between NarG variants and NarJ or NarH were probed in a wild-type BTH101 strain using a two-hybrid approach. The indicated values represent β-galactosidase activities expressed in Miller units. Negative controls using the Zip fusion proteins have been performed and have systematically given 50 Miller units. The data are the average of at least three independent experiments that vary by no more than 10% from the mean.

Sensorgrams of interaction between immobilized NarJ-His6 and the NarG variants are expressed in resonance units. The control flow cell (no protein immobilized) was subtracted from the experimental flow cell, allowing direct visualization of the specific binding. Crude extracts issued from the nar strain transformed with the following plasmids were injected over both control and test flow cells. In B, T18 derivative plasmids were employed: pT18-Zip, pT18-NarG, and pT18-NarG-(1-40). In C, T25 derivative plasmids were employed: pT25-Zip, pT25-NarG, and pT25-NarG-(Δ1-40).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a complementary set of experiments, we assessed the ability of the truncated NarG variant to interact with NarJ. Unexpectedly, deletion of the first 40 residues of NarG does not hamper its interaction with NarJ, as seen using a bacterial two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the truncated protein still interacts with NarH (Fig. 4A) or with the Moco biosynthetic proteins that promote Moco delivery (data not shown), suggesting a structural integrity of the protein. BIAcore analysis confirms that the NarG variant specifically interacts with NarJ (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data indicated the presence of at least two NarJ-binding sites within NarG. Further, the ability of the truncated NarG protein to yield an active and membrane-bound complex was assessed. Although it completely lacked any physiological quinol:nitrate oxidoreductase activity (data not shown), the truncated version of NarG exhibited benzyl viologen:nitrate oxidoreductase activity (Table 2), indicating the presence of Moco in the enzyme complex and maintenance of its structural integrity (32Buc J. Santini C.L. Blasco F. Giordani R. Cardenas M.L. Chippaux M. Cornish-Bowden A. Giordano G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The finding that the enzyme is active with an artificial electron donor (benzyl viologen), but not with the physiological electron donor (quinol), suggested a disturbed membrane anchoring to NarI resulting in the loss of electron transfer throughout the NarGHI complex. Further, localization analysis showed that membrane anchoring is affected (55% as compared with 97% for the wild-type active enzyme) (Table 2). Such an observation is not surprising considering that the N-terminal tail of NarG is involved in NarI subunit interaction together with NarH (20Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Overall, these results demonstrated that the NarJ-binding site located within the truncated protein is essential for Moco incorporation.TABLE 2Nitrate reductase activities and cellular distribution of various forms of nitrate reductases Benzylviologen:nitrate reductase activities are given as μmol nitrite formed min-1 mg-1 of nitrate reductase present in either CE, M, or S fractions.

Deletion of this fragment should thus enhance anchoring of the apoenzyme prior to the Moco insertion step. This should be visualized by a low specific enzymatic activity of the N-terminally truncated NarG variant present in the membrane fractions. Indeed, the benzyl viologen:nitrate oxidoreductase specific activity (expressed in μmol of nitrite produced, min-1 mg-1 nitrate reductase) is an intrinsic parameter of the enzyme that assesses the presence of Moco and enzyme integrity. In a wild-type context (nar/pNarGHJI strain), no significant differences in terms of specific activity were observed between the enzyme present in the soluble or the membrane fractions (70-100 units) (Table 2). Interestingly, the specific activity of the truncated enzyme located into the membrane fraction was much lower (5-fold less) than the one measured for the soluble counterpart. This indicated a low proportion of Moco-containing and active enzymes in the membrane fractions. These data suggested that an uncontrolled membrane anchoring of both the apo- and holoenzyme complexes occurs in the absence of the N-terminal tail of NarG. In a different but complementary set of experiments, we determined whether the N-terminal tail of NarG provided in trans in a wild-type strain could titrate in vivo NarJ from the nitrate reductase biogenesis process (Table 2). A plasmid construction allowing expression of a fusion protein between the first 40 amino acids of NarG and the T18 domain of the adenylate cyclase was employed to transform the wild-type strain. Interestingly, the specific enzymatic activity measured in the crude extract from the WT/pT18-NarG-(1-40) strain is much lower than that prepared from the wild-type strain transformed with the vector control (20 versus 94 units) (Table 2). Thus, the N-terminal tail of NarG provided in trans negatively influences the level of maturation of the nitrate reductase. Cell fractionation was performed using both strains and showed that the enzyme distribution was not affected by the presence of the NarG fragment. Further, in the presence of the N-terminal tail provided in trans, the specific activity of the membrane-bound enzyme was reduced as compared with the one measured for the soluble counterpart (22 versus 75 units) (Table 2). Overall, these data indicated that deletion of the N-terminal fragment of NarG or providing it in trans results in a drastic reduction of the quality of the nitrate reductase complex attached to the cytoplasmic membrane as evaluated by the enzyme specific activity. Molybdenum cofactor acquisition has become an important area of study given the wide range of functions carried out by molybdoenzymes in all domains of life. Moco is systematically found deeply buried into the enzyme complexes, suggesting that the subunit assembly and the cofactor incorporation must be coordinated. The Moco insertion process involves several accessory proteins (30Vergnes A. Gouffi-Belhabich K. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41398-41403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), among which the enzyme-specific chaperones facilitate the process by the initial formation of a complex with the apoenzyme (10Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The work presented here has answered two fundamental questions on molybdoenzyme biogenesis. (i) Considering the multisubunit character of numerous molybdoenzymes, at which particular stage of assembly does the Moco insertion event occur? (ii) How could such an event be controlled? Here, using the heterotrimeric nitrate reductase A from E. coli as a model, we demonstrated that the enzyme-specific chaperone NarJ binds two distinct sites on the apoenzyme to coordinate both molybdenum cofactor insertion and multisubunit assembly. Our results support a model depicted in Fig. 5 for how sequential interaction between NarJ and the apoenzyme promotes assembly and Moco incorporation within a multisubunit molybdoenzyme. At first, both the NarG and the NarH subunits associate, forming the apoNarGH complex. At this stage, we showed that the complex may interact with the membrane-anchor NarI subunit, leading to the formation of an inactive NarGHI complex that can no longer incorporate the cofactor. Such an assertion is supported by examination of the crystal structure of the membrane-bound apoenzyme, produced in a mob strain, which shows a closed conformation identical to the native enzyme (20Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 33Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Cammack R. Palak M. Blasco F. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5324-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the apoNarGH complex may enter the maturation pathway by the initial interaction with the NarJ protein. At this stage, NarJ determines the fate of the apoenzyme complex by shifting the equilibrium toward the Moco insertion pathway. In addition to its protective role on the apoenzyme, we showed (i) that NarJ binding to the N-terminal tail of NarG prevents premature membrane anchoring of the apoNarGH complex and (ii) that NarJ binding to another site of NarG allows the interaction with the Moco delivery machinery constituted by several proteins involved in the final stages of Moco biosynthesis (30Vergnes A. Gouffi-Belhabich K. Blasco F. Giordano G. Magalon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41398-41403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we showed that NarJ titration using the N-terminal tail of NarG not only reduces the level of Moco-containing enzyme but also redirects some of the apoNarGH complex toward membrane anchoring prior to Moco insertion. Once NarG has folded consecutively to cofactor insertion, the NarJ chaperone and the Moco biosynthetic proteins are dislodged by an unknown mechanism, and the active holoNarGH complex is then free to interact with NarI via the N-terminal tail of NarG and NarH. To summarize, the fate of the nitrate reductase apoprotein complex in the cytoplasm can be determined by the equilibrium of three factors: the folding kinetic of the apoenzyme, the rate of membrane anchoring, and the efficiency of the Moco incorporation process. Our results were consistent with NarJ controlling each of these factors, an action that goes beyond its restricted chaperone function. Likely, another NarJ-binding site exists in the N-terminally truncated version of NarG, in which NarJ facilitates Moco insertion. The exact location of this second binding site remains unclear. Considering that the association and dissociation criteria for NarJ binding onto either site of NarG are the same, i.e. binding on the apoNarGH precursor and release upon Moco incorporation, one can envision that both NarJ-binding sites are structurally connected. Such coupling may enhance the co-association and dissociation steps and minimize the possibility that NarJ remains at the N-terminal tail of NarG, preventing membrane anchoring of the holoNarGH complex. Alternatively, NarJ can be released from the N-terminal tail of NarG with an intrinsic time constant, providing sufficient time for Moco incorporation to be completed before membrane anchoring. Recently, studies on the membrane-bound nitrate reductase (NarCGHI) from T. thermophilus revealed that multisubunit assembly and Moco incorporation are coupled (22Zafra O. Cava F. Blasco F. Magalon A. Berenguer J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3990-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, a different biogenesis pathway has been delineated as compared with the E. coli enzyme. Indeed, the NarJ-assisted Moco incorporation step strictly requires prior membrane anchoring of the apoNarGH complex to the NarCI anchor subunits (22Zafra O. Cava F. Blasco F. Magalon A. Berenguer J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3990-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Further, sequence analysis of the NarG subunit from T. thermophilus revealed the absence of the N-terminal tail targeted by NarJ in the E. coli NarG protein. Such an observation could explain the different biogenesis scheme depicted for the thermophilic enzyme complex. The underlying concept of this work is that coordination of multisubunit assembly and metal cofactor insertion is fundamental for productive synthesis of a multisubunit metalloprotein. Our results bring interesting comparisons with other systems such as the [NiFe] hydrogenases (34Blokesch M. Paschos A. Theodoratou E. Bauer A. Hube M. Huth S. Bock A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The fully mature and active hydrogenase is a heterodimer made up of a large subunit that carries the [NiFe] center and an electron-transfer small subunit (35Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Meyer J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 455-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key intermediate during maturation is a complex between the precursor form of the large subunit and a chaperone protein (36Drapal N. Bock A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 37Magalon A. Bock A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21114-21120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After maturation of the large subunit, the final step of hydrogenase maturation is the formation of the heterodimer (38Magalon A. Bock A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the case of periplasmic hydrogenases, it clearly appears that the existence of the heterodimer is a prerequisite for translocation as only the small subunit harbors the twin arginine-containing signal peptide that directs the complex to the Tat translocon (39Rodrigue A. Chanal A. Beck K. Muller M. Wu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13223-13228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 40Wu L.F. Chanal A. Rodrigue A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Addendum—During the course of our work, Jack et al. (41Jack R.L. Buchanan G. Dubini A. Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3962-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) showed, for complex cofactor-containing Tat substrates such as [NiFe] hydrogenases and a monomeric molybdoenzyme, the trimethylamine N-oxide reductase, that Tat signal peptides via the binding of dedicated chaperones play a key role in coordinating metal cofactor assembly and translocation of a fully assembled metalloprotein. These observations are in complete agreement with our results in which NarJ coordinates Moco insertion and membrane anchoring of a fully assembled nitrate reductase. Consequently, such a quality control activity mediated by enzyme-specific chaperones is not restricted to exported metalloproteins nor to the presence of a Tat signal peptide, but it is rather a consequence of an evolutionary pressure for an efficient and successful synthesis of complex metalloenzymes.

The intraerythrocytic development of malaria parasites is blocked when the activity of aminopeptidases is specifically inhibited by reagents such as bestatin. One of the major aminopeptidases of malaria parasites is a leucyl aminopeptidase of the M17 family. We reasoned that, when this enzyme was the target of bestatin inhibition, its overexpression in malaria cells would lead to a reduced sensitivity to the inhibitor. To address this supposition, transgenic Plasmodium falciparum parasites overexpressing the leucyl aminopeptidase were generated by transfection with a plasmid that housed the full-length gene. Transgenic parasites expressed a 65-kDa protein close to the predicted molecule size of 67.831 kDa for the introduced leucyl aminopeptidase, and immunofluorescence studies localized the protein to the cytosol, the location of the native enzyme. The product of the transgene was shown to be functionally active with cytosolic extracts of transgenic parasites exhibiting twice the leucyl aminopeptidase activity compared with wild-type parasites. In vitro inhibitor sensitivity assays demonstrated that the transgenic parasites were more resistant to bestatin (EC50 64 μm) compared with the parent parasites (EC50 25 μm).

Overexpression of genes in malaria parasites would have general application in the identification and validation of targets for antimalarial drugs. During the development and asexual reproduction of malaria parasites within erythrocytes, as much as 65–75% of erythrocyte hemoglobin is internalized and digested (1McKerrow J.H. Sun E. Rosenthal P.J. Bouvier J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 821-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 2Rosenthal P.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). There is still some conjecture as to the reason why the parasite needs to degrade such a large proportion of the erythrocyte hemoglobin, but several theories have been proposed (3Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 4Rosenthal P.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has been known for some time that malaria parasites require amino acids derived from host hemoglobin for protein synthesis and development (4Rosenthal P.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although recent studies suggest that the fraction of digested hemoglobin used for this purpose is surprisingly small (in the region of 16%) (5Krugliak M. Zhang J. Ginsburg H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Malaria parasites acquire additional amino acids from the extracellular medium and incorporate these into their proteins (5Krugliak M. Zhang J. Ginsburg H. Mol. Biochem.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It is now believed that the excess hemoglobin digestion is necessary to reduce the colloid-osmotic pressure within the infected erythrocyte and thus prevent premature cell lysis (9Lew V.L. MacDonald L. Ginsburg H. Krugliak M. Tiffert T. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Apart from contributing to the regulation of the internal osmotic pressure, the constant influx and efflux of amino acids may also ensure that there is a sufficient supply of each amino acid, especially those that are rare in hemoglobin (isoleucine, cysteine, glutamine, methionine, and glutamate), for protein synthesis (3Francis S.E.

Hemoglobin is endocytosed into double membrane vesicles that bud off from the cytosome of the parasite and are transported to the acidic digestive vacuole (DV) 5The abbreviations used are: DVdigestive vacuoleNHMec7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin. 5The abbreviations used are: DVdigestive vacuoleNHMec7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin.

Within this specialized organelle, hemoglobin is digested by endopeptidases at a pH of ∼5.5 in a semiordered fashion, initially at the hinge region by the aspartic peptidases plasmepsins I and II and then further by the aspartyl peptidases I, II, and IV, and the histoaspartic peptidase and three cysteine peptidases, falcipain-2, -2′, and -3 (1McKerrow J.H.

Peptides generated from this digestion are processed by a metalloprotease, falcilysin, into short oligopeptides of 5–10 amino acids and then by a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I, which reduces these to dipeptides (12Klemba M. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43000-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, free amino acids are not generated within the DV, as no exoaminopeptidase activity has been detected in isolated DV (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem.

Plasmodium falciparum aminopeptidase activity, partially purified by affinity chromatography employing the inhibitor bestatin as a ligand, cleaved synthetic peptides representative of the products of endopeptidase-degraded hemoglobin (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A. O'Callaghan S.A. Dalton J.P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and exhibited a general preference for substrates containing leucine and alanine at the N terminus (amino acids that constitute 25% of the amino acid residues in human hemoglobin) (15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A. O'Callaghan S.A. Dalton J.P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Aminopeptidase activity predominates in trophozoites, and the greatest in vitro growth inhibition by bestatin and nitrobestatin occurs when parasites are at the late ring and early trophozoite stage (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This coincides with the period of increased metabolic activity within the infected erythrocyte, increased hemoglobin digestion, the induction of new permeability pathways, and rapid growth of the parasite (4Rosenthal P.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 9Lew V.L. MacDonald L. Ginsburg H. Krugliak M. Tiffert T. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The leucyl aminopeptidase-like activity detected in soluble extracts of malaria parasites could be derived from two distinct aminopeptidases that display overlapping substrate specificities. The first is represented by a previously characterized 122-kDa zinc aminopeptidase of the M1 family, which may be membrane-bound but processed to two soluble forms of 96 and 68 kDa (21Florent I. Derhy Z. Allargy M. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Shrevel J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Allary M. Schrevel J. Florent I. Parasitology. 2002; 125: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The second is the product of a gene described in the present study that encodes a 67.831-kDa leucyl aminopeptidase of the M17 family (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A. O'Callaghan S.A. Dalton J.P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have overexpressed the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase gene in malaria parasites and shown that functional enzyme is expressed in the cytosol of transgenic parasites, the same compartment as the native enzyme (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A. O'Callaghan S.A. Dalton J.P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More importantly, we have demonstrated that malaria parasites overexpressing M17 leucyl aminopeptidase are more resistant to killing by bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor with antimalarial activity compared with wild-type parasites. Parasites—P. falciparum clone D10 derived from P. falciparum isolate FC27 was obtained from The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia. Parasites were cultured as described previously (23Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6161) Google Scholar). Construction of the Transgenic Expression Plasmids and Transfection of Malaria Parasites—Pf14_0439, as annotated by PlasmoDB (plasmodb.org), is a gene located on chromosome 14 of P. falciparum. It consists of a single exon of 1818 bp that encodes a 605-amino-acid protein of the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase family. A PCR fragment corresponding to the predicted mRNA/RNA sequence was amplified from DNA isolated from P. falciparum clone D10. The forward primer for Pf14_0439 was AP14F (AGATCTATGTATTTTTCTTCCTTATGT) and contained a BglII restriction site (in bold). The reverse primer was AP14R (CTGCAGTAGAGCGTCATTGAGTACAAA) and contained a PstI site (in bold) but not the putative stop codon of the gene. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM using a TA cloning system (Promega) and sequenced to confirm that no Taq-associated errors have been introduced into the DNA. The full-length fragment was digested out of the pGEM vector using the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the Gateway™-compatible entry vector pHcmycB (Gateway, Invitrogen) that had previously been digested using BglII and PstI. A c-Myc tag was ligated in-frame at the 3′ end of the introduced gene sequence. This vector is a variant of the pHGB vector described by Tonkin et al. (24Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), in which the c-Myc 10-amino-acid epitope tag flanked by a 5′ PstI site and a 3′ NsiI site has been cloned into the original PstI site of pHGB. The entry vector containing the Pf14_0439 transgene was designated pHAP14cmycB. A clonase reaction was then performed using this entry vector and a Gateway™-compatible destination vector. The destination vector contained not only a Gateway™ destination cassette but also a second cassette comprising the human dihydofolate reductase synthetase gene under the control of the P. falciparum calmodulin promoter. This second cassette acts as a selectable marker in P. falciparum. This final plasmid was designated pHH1-HAP14cmycB. Ring-stage parasites were subjected to electroporation in the presence of 150 μg of plasmid as described previously (25Skinner-Adams T.S. Lawrie P.M. Hawthorne P.L. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Malaria J. 2003; 2: 19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parasites resistant to WR99210 were obtained 15–22 days later. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was carried out essentially as described previously using total RNA extracts from trophozoite stage parasites (26Hawthorne P.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Spielmann T. Fischer K. Dixon M.W. Ortega M.A. Anderson K.A. Kemp D.J. Gardiner D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To distinguish between transgene and endogenous gene expression, the blot was probed with a DNA fragment containing the c-Myc epitope tag and the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the transgene labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming (DECAprime II, Ambion). Immunoblotting—Proteins of saponin-lysed parasite extracts were resolved by reducing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry electroblotter (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad) (26Hawthorne P.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Spielmann T. Fischer K. Dixon M.W. Ortega M.A. Anderson K.A. Kemp D.J. Gardiner D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to c-Myc (1:2500 dilution; Sigma) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000 dilution, Chemicon International Inc.). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mouse monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) to demonstrate equal loading and transfer of malaria proteins (26Hawthorne P.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Spielmann T. Fischer K. Dixon M.W. Ortega M.A. Anderson K.A. Kemp D.J. Gardiner D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis of Parasites—Acetone-fixed thin blood smears of the transgenic parasite and wild-type D10 were probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to c-Myc (1:2000) and bound antibody visualized with goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy2 (10 μg/ml) (26Hawthorne P.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Spielmann T. Fischer K. Dixon M.W. Ortega M.A. Anderson K.A. Kemp D.J. Gardiner D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The parasite nuclei were visualized with Hoechst dye (0.5 μg/ml). The slides were viewed with a fluorescence microscope (×1000 magnification). Assays for Leucine Aminopeptidase Activity—Aminopeptidase activity was measured by monitoring the release of the leaving group 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (NHMec) from the fluorogenic peptide substrates H-leucine-NHMec and H-alanine-NHMec (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A. O'Callaghan S.A. Dalton J.P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples of soluble parasite extracts were added to the substrate (10 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline in a final volume of 200 μl in wells of a 96-microtitre plate. The reaction was monitored at 37 °C over a 30-min period in a spectrofluorimeter with excitation at 370 nm and emission at 440 nm. Protein assays were performed using the BCA protein acid kit employing bovine serum albumin as a standard. Parasite Growth and Sensitivity to Inhibitors—The in vitro sensitivities of the wild-type and transfected parasite populations to the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin {(-)-N-[(2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyryl]-l-leucine} (Sigma) were determined using the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assay (27Skinner-Adams T.S. Davis T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of inhibitor were prepared in culture medium (0.05–50 μm) and added with [3H]hypoxanthine (0.5 μCi/well) to asynchronous cultures at a 0.5% parasitaemia and 2% hematocrit. After a 48-h incubation, the amount of [3H]hypoxanthine incorporated into the parasites was measured, and the concentrations of inhibitor required to prevent incorporation by 50% (EC50) were determined by linear interpolation of inhibition curves (28Huber W. Koella J. Acta. Trop. 1993; 55: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in triplicate on three separate occasions, and data were pooled and are presented as mean ± S.E. Transfection of Plasmid pHH1-HAP14cmycB Generates an Aminopeptidase Transgenic Parasite—P. falciparum clone D10 ring-stage parasites were transfected with the Pf14_0439 transgene and selected on WR99210. Parasites resistant to WR99210 were observed 15–22 days later. DNA was extracted when transgenic cultures reached 1% parasitaemia and the presence of the plasmid determined by PCR amplification using vector-specific primers located in the heat shock protein 86 5′ UTR and the Plasmodium berghei dihydrofolate reductase 3′ UTR (i.e. flanking the inserted aminopeptidase gene) (24Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Gel analysis of the PCR-generated DNA revealed a band of 2 kb for pHH1-HAP14cmycB (Fig. 1A), the expected size for the M17 aminopeptidase gene plus additional vector sequence. The transgenic parasite cultures were maintained on WR99210 selection thereafter to sustain the episomally carried plasmids. The growth rate and intraerythrocytic development of the transgenic parasites were not distinguishable from wild-type parasites (data not shown). The Aminopeptidase Transgene Is Transcribed and Translated—Northern blot analysis showed that the pHH1-HAP14cmycB-transfected malaria parasite cultures transcribed a single species of mRNA with an apparent size of 2.3 kb (Fig. 1B) when hybridized using a DNA fragment corresponding to the c-Myc tag and the 3′ UTR of the transgene. When saponin-lysed parasite-infected erythrocytes of the same cultures were probed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc tag monoclonal antibody, a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa (slightly smaller than the theoretical molecular mass of 67.831 kDa) was detected (Fig. 1C). Immunolocalization of Transgene Products—To determine the cellular location of the protein product of the leucyl aminopeptidase transgene, an immunofluorescence assay was performed using anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2). A diffuse staining characteristic of localization to the parasite cytoplasm was observed. Staining with the anti-serum was observed only in parasitized red blood cells as confirmed by nuclear staining with Hoechst dye (Fig. 2), and no staining was observed in the wild-type D10 parasites (Fig. 2). The Pf14_0439 Transgene Expresses a Functional Protein—Soluble extracts of malaria parasites were prepared and assayed for leucyl aminopeptidase activity using the fluorogenic substrates H-leucine-NHMec and H-alanine-NHMec. The activity of these extracts against H-leucine-NHMec was higher than against H-alanine-NHMec, which would be expected of a M17 cytosolic leucyl aminopeptidase (29Strater N. Lipscomb W.N. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., London2004: 896-901Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Malaria parasites transfected with the Pf14_0439 transgene exhibited approximately twice the specific aminopeptidase activity (relative fluorescence units/106 infected cells) against both substrates compared with wild-type parasites (Fig. 3). Activity in all extracts was completely inhibited by 10 μm bestatin (data not shown). The Transgenic P. falciparum Clone Has Altered Sensitivity to Aminopeptidase Inhibitors—Parasites transfected with pHH1-HAP14cmycB and maintained on 50 nm WR99210 were more resistant to bestatin than either D10 parent parasites or parasites transfected with the pHH1 vector without the AP14cmyc cassette and maintained under a similar selection regime; the combined data of three separate tests showed that the parasites exhibited an EC50 of 64, 25, and 20 μm, respectively (Fig. 4). Aminopeptidases are exopeptidases that catalyze the sequential removal of amino acids from the N termini of peptides and play a major role in regulating the balance between catabolism and anabolism in all living cells. In malaria parasites, leucyl aminopeptidase-like enzymes are believed to function in the terminal stages of hemoglobin digestion to generate free amino acids that are then used for parasite protein synthesis (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A. O'Callaghan S.A. Dalton J.P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because malaria parasites also use amino acids taken from their external environment for protein synthesis, it appears that the aminopeptidases may also be important in regulating the internal free amino acid pool for additional purposes, including maintenance of the osmotic stability of the cell (9Lew V.L. MacDonald L. Ginsburg H. Krugliak M. Tiffert T. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Two leucyl aminopeptidase-like enzymes are expressed by malaria parasites, a 122-kDa membrane alanine aminopeptidase of the M1 family and a 67.8-kDa leucyl aminopeptidase of the M17 family (21Florent I. Derhy Z. Allargy M. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Shrevel J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Allary M. Schrevel J. Florent I. Parasitology. 2002; 125: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Aminopeptidases of the M1 family are generally considered to be membrane-bound (30Turner A.J. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., London2004: 289-294Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but Florent and co-workers (22Allary M. Schrevel J. Florent I. Parasitology. 2002; 125: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown by soluble extraction and immunofluorescence studies that 96- and 68-kDa forms, presumably processed from the parent molecule, are found in the cytosol of malaria cells. The M17 family of aminopeptidase, on the other hand, are found in the cytosol of all cells and do not undergo processing events (29Strater N. Lipscomb W.N. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., London2004: 896-901Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both classes of enzyme exhibit optimal activity at neutral pH and have similar preferences for amino acids, although as their names imply, they show a preference for either alanine or leucine. These overlapping biochemical features have led to confusion as to the true nature of the leucine-aminopeptidase activity measured in many studies that used soluble extracts of malaria parasites as their enzyme source (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 3285-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and to the identity of the target of aminopeptidase inhibitors that have antimalarial activity. Recent studies (31Le Roch K.G. Zhou Y. Blair P.L. Grainger M. Moch J.K. Haynes J.D. De La Vega P. Holder A.A. Batalov S. Carucci D.J. Winzeler E.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1503-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 32Bozdech Z. Llinas M. Pulliam B.L. Wong E.D. Zhu J. DeRisi J.L. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar) using microarrays have provided expression profiles for the M1 and M17 aminopeptidase throughout the intraerythrocytic stages of malaria parasites and demonstrate that the both enzymes are most highly expressed in early trophozoites, which is consistent with earlier biochemical studies (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A. O'Callaghan S.A. Dalton J.P. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the expression level of the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase is ∼18-fold higher than the M1 aminopeptidase. The corollary of these findings is that the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase is the predominant source of leucyl aminopeptidase-like activity in malaria parasites and thus is most likely the subject of the previous biochemical and inhibitor studies. In the present study, we have shown that the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase can be overexpressed in malaria cells by transfecting ring-stage parasites with the transgene housed in the pHH1-HAP14cmycB vector prepared in our laboratory. The transgene was transcribed and expressed as a single 65-kDa protein. Immunofluorescence studies showed that it was transported correctly to the cytosol, the site of the native enzyme (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Most importantly, enzymatic assays with specific peptide substrates showed that the transfected malaria cells expressed twice as much aminopeptidase activity as wild-type cells, which we can presume is because of the proper folding and activation of the enzyme synthesized from the transfected gene. The introduction of the transgene did not alter the in vitro growth rate or viability of the malaria cells. Accordingly, although we suggested that leucyl aminopepitdases are important in the regulation of the free amino acid pool in malaria cells, the increased enzyme activity within the cells did not upset this function sufficiently to affect malaria growth. It is probable that cells that overexpressed leucyl aminopeptidase to a lethal level were lost during the selection of transgene-carrying parasites using WR99210. Bestatin is a dipeptide originally isolated from filtrates of Streptomyces olivoretticuli and has immunopotentiating and antitumor activity (33Umezawa H. Aoyagi T. Suda H. Hamada M. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1976; 29: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 34Ichinose Y. Genka K. Kioke T. Kato H. Watanabe Y. Mori T. Iioka S. Sakuma A. Ohta M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have reported that bestatin, which inhibits aminopeptidase members of both the M1 and M17 families (27Skinner-Adams T.S. Davis T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Turner A.J. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., London2004: 289-294Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was a potent inhibitor of the in vitro growth of malaria parasites (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Nankya-Kitaka M.F. Curley G.P. Gavigan C.S. Bell A. Dalton J.P. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Exposure of synchronized cultures of P. falciparum cultures to bestatin and its derivative nitrobestatin indicated that late rings/trophozoites are the most susceptible intraerythrocytic stage. This correlates with the time at which hemoglobin is being degraded and used as a source of nutrient and also with the increased expression of both the M1 and M17 aminopeptidases (13Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Florent I. Derhy Z. Allargy M. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Shrevel J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Le Roch K.G. Zhou Y. Blair P.L. Grainger M. Moch J.K. Haynes J.D. De La Vega P. Holder A.A. Batalov S. Carucci D.J. Winzeler E.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1503-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 32Bozdech Z. Llinas M. Pulliam B.L. Wong E.D. Zhu J. DeRisi J.L. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Here we show that P. falciparum parasites overexpressing the M17 leucyl aminopepidase are >2-fold less susceptible to killing by bestatin (EC50 64 μm) compared with wild-type parasites (EC50 25 μm). The natural interpretation of these results is that higher amounts of bestatin, which binds aminopeptidases in an equimolar ratio, are required to reduce the intracellular activity of leucyl aminopeptidase to lethal levels in malaria cells that express more of this enzyme. By extension, our studies show that the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase is a target of bestatin in malaria cells. During this study, malaria parasites were also transfected with the gene encoding the M1 membrane alanyl aminopeptidase, but these transgenic parasites did not exhibit an increase in aminopeptidase activity or a difference in susceptibility to bestatin compared wild-type malaria cells (data not shown). Although immunoblotting demonstrated that a protein of the expected molecular size (∼120 kDa) was expressed by the transgenic parasites, this was not processed to the soluble smaller molecular size forms of 96 and 68 kDa that were detected in the native parasites by Florent and co-workers (22Allary M. Schrevel J. Florent I. Parasitology. 2002; 125: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The translated M1 aminopeptidase may not have been correctly folded and/or post-translationally modified to produce a functionally active enzyme, and therefore we cannot make a conclusion on its potential as a target for bestatin-mediated killing of malaria. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that overexpression of the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase prevents killing of malaria parasites by providing more enzyme to compete for bestatin binding and preventing it from inhibiting the M1 aminopeptidase. Cysteinyl (falcipain 1–3) and aspartyl (plasmepsins I–IV) endopeptidases are involved in the degradation of hemoglobin within the digestive vacuole (1McKerrow J.H. Sun E. Rosenthal P.J. Bouvier J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 821-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 2Rosenthal P.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3Francis S.E.

Specific or broad range inhibitors of these endopeptidases block hemoglobin degradation and have potent effects on malaria growth, and therefore both enzyme classes are intensely studied as targets for new antimalarial drugs (3Francis S.E.

Because cysteinyl and aspartyl inhibitors exhibit synergistic activity when used together, combination therapies are also possible (36Semenov A. Olson J.E. Rosenthal P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2254-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene disruption methods have been used to explore the function of these enzymes and their role in hemoglobin digestion. Disruption of the gene encoding falcipain 2 did not result in complete ablation of cysteine endopeptidase activity but did impair hemoglobin digestion and parasite growth (37Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4384-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), whereas disruption of falcipain 1 had no effect on either (38Sijwali P.S. Kato K. Seydel K.B. Gut J. Lehman J. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Miller L.H. Rosenthal P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8721-8726Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2004; 279: 43000-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) is lethal to malaria parasites, and hence these peptidases are considered critical to survival within the erythrocyte. As an alternative to employing gene disruption methods for studying the importance of peptidases in malaria, we exploited the transfection plasmids available in our laboratory to overexpress the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase in malaria parasites. Tonkin et al. (24Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) described the design of transfection vectors for producing proteins fused with the reporter protein green fluorescent protein and exploited these to localize malaria proteins to specific intracellular compartments, such as the plastid and mitochondrion. In this study, these vectors were further modified by replacing the green fluorescent protein reporter with the significantly smaller c-Myc epitope tag allowing production of functional molecules that could be traced with anti-c-Myc antibodies. Using this approach, we also identified the M17 aminopeptidase as a target for the antimalarial activity of bestatin and therefore suggest that this could be a general approach for the characterization and validation of malaria drug targets. Cysteinyl or aspartyl inhibitors and bestatin show little synergy against malaria parasites in vitro, most likely because the aminopeptidase functions in separate cell compartments from the endopeptidases (39Gavigan C.S. Machado S.G. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 3175-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, a combination of drugs targeted at multiple exoaminopeptidases involved in amino acid regulation in the parasite cytosol may offer a more reasonable proposition for combination therapies; the targets would not only include the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase and M1 membrane alanine aminopeptidases but also two uncharacterized enzymes expressed by the intraerythrocytic stages of malaria, namely prolyl aminopeptidase and aspartyl aminopeptidases (plasmodb.org)."
https://openalex.org/W2048767165,"The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is a tumor suppressor and key regulator of the cell cycle. We have previously shown that pRB interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases, lipid kinases that can regulate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels in the nucleus. Here, we investigated pRB binding to another lipid kinase in the phosphoinositide cycle, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) that phosphorylates the second messenger diacylglycerol to yield phosphatidic acid. We found that DGKζ, but not DGKα or DGKθ, interacts with pRB in vitro and in vivo. Binding of DGKζ to pRB is dependent on the phosphorylation status of pRB, since only hypophosphorylated pRB interacts with DGKζ. DGKζ also binds to the pRB-related pocket proteins p107 and p130 in vitro and in cells. Although DGKζ did not affect the ability of pRB to regulate E2F-mediated transcription, we found that pRB, p107, and p130 potently stimulate DGKζ activity in vitro. Finally, overexpression of DGKζ in pRB-null fibroblasts reconstitutes a cell cycle arrest induced by γ-irradiation. These results suggest that DGKζ may act in vivo as a downstream effector of pRB to regulate nuclear levels of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid.

Betz A. Wegmeyer H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). DAG can be produced by the action of several different signal transduction pathways, including phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides or phosphatidylcholine and phospholipase D-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine followed by dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA), and during de novo synthesis of phospholipids (2van Blitterswijk W.J.

DAG is not only produced at the plasma membrane but at other intracellular sites as well, including the nucleus. Nuclear DAG levels are increased in liver as a consequence of two-thirds partial hepatectomy (3Banfic H. Zizak M. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in cell cultures treated with insulin-like growth factor 1, which stimulates proliferation (4Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 5Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This suggests that nuclear DAG levels are intimately linked with cell cycle progression, but a causal relationship has not been firmly established. An attractive hypothesis is that nuclear DAG stimulates cell cycle progression via a DAG-binding protein such as PKC (1Brose N. Betz A. Wegmeyer H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Indeed, DAG in the nucleus recruits and activates PKC in response to insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells, which is required for G1 to S phase transition (4Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 7Neri L.M. Borgatti P. Capitani S. Martelli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29738-29744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the role of PKC in regulating the cell cycle is complex, with different PKC isoforms inducing a cell cycle arrest or stimulation of cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the same PKC isoform is able to induce both an arrest and progression through the cell cycle when expressed in different cell types (8Livneh E. Fishman D.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, DAG kinase (DGK) controls the levels of DAG generated from PI-phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 (9D'Santos C.S. Clarke J.H. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and nuclear DGK activity can be stimulated in response to both growth factor (10Martelli A.M. Tabellini G. Bortul R. Manzoli L. Bareggi R. Baldini G. Grill V. Zweyer M. Narducci P. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 815-821PubMed Google Scholar) and peptide-hormone treatment (11Bregoli L. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23288-23295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DGKζ (Fig. 1A) is one of 10 different DGK isoforms identified to date (12Luo B. Regier D.S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). DGKζ contains a nuclear localization signal (14Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and DGKζ has indeed been shown to be nuclear in some cell types (16Hozumi Y. Ito T. Nakano T. Nakagawa T. Aoyagi M. Kondo H. Goto K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1448-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Hogan A. Shepherd L. Chabot J. Quenneville S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. Gee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26526-26533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization signal sequence in DGKζ overlaps with a motif similar to the PKC phosphorylation site domain (PSD) within the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) protein (DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD). The DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD can be phosphorylated by PKC, which prevents nuclear accumulation of DGKζ (15Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD also inhibits DGKζ activity (18Luo B. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39542-39547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpression of DGKζ within the nucleus inhibits cell cycle progression (15Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, the levels and activity of DGKζ in the nucleus are subject to regulation by PKC, whereas, conversely, DGKζ may regulate nuclear DAG levels and consequently PKC activity. We previously demonstrated that, in vivo, the level of nuclear PI(4,5)P2 can be modulated by the interaction of Type I PIP-kinases (enzymes that synthesize PI(4,5)P2) with pRB (19Divecha N. Roefs M. Los A. Halstead J. Bannister A. D'Santos C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 582-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Together with its family members p107 and p130, pRB regulates cell cycle progression by interacting with and attenuating the activity of the E2F transcription factor family (20DiCiommo D. Gallie B.L. Bremner R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Classon M. Dyson N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Since PI(4,5)P2 is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C, which generates DAG, and since this nuclear DAG was shown to be subsequently phosphorylated by a DGK (9D'Santos C.S. Clarke J.H. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Martelli A.M. Tabellini G. Bortul R. Manzoli L. Bareggi R. Baldini G. Grill V. Zweyer M. Narducci P. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 815-821PubMed Google Scholar), we questioned whether pRB may act as a nuclear scaffold to regulate PI signaling and DAG phosphorylation. In this study, we show that GST-pRB fusion proteins can bind and extract DGK, PIP-kinase, and PI-kinase activities from cell lysates. We identify DGKζ as the DGK isoform that specifically interacts both in vitro and in vivo with pRB and its family members p107 and p130 and show that this interaction potently enhances DGK activity. Finally, we demonstrate that DGKζ probably lies downstream of pRB signaling in a DNA damage signaling pathway. Our data would imply that disruption of pRB function, which frequently occurs in human cancers, may lead to enhanced nuclear DAG levels and, in turn, to uncontrolled nuclear PKC activity. Expression Plasmids—Wild-type DGKζ, catalytic inactive DGKζ, the DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD deletion mutant, and COOH-terminal FLAG-tagged DGKζ were published previously (15Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal HA-tagged DGKζ and GFP-DGKζ were cloned via three-point ligations into pMT2SM-HA and pEGFP-C2, respectively, using internal NdeI and XmaI sites, respectively. The 5′ fragment was generated by PCR, and the 3′ fragment was digested from wild-type DGKζ. GST-DGKζ and VSV-DGKζ (both COOH terminus) were cloned by inserting DGKζ in pMT2SM-GST and pMT2SM-tag, respectively, via a three-point ligation using the internal SphI site. The 3′ fragment was generated by PCR, and the 5′ fragment was derived from wild-type DGKζ. The GST-pRB C terminus (amino acids 767–928) was generated by PCR and inserted into pGEX-4T-2. Wild-type and kinase-inactive DGKζ were cloned into pBabe by PCR. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, HEK293T, Phoenix, MCF7, MEF, MEL, SAOS-2, and C33A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. COS-7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method; HEK293T, Phoenix and C33A cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method; and SAOS-2 cells were transfected using Fugene (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cellular Lysates and Immunoprecipitations—Rat brain lysates were prepared as described (19Divecha N. Roefs M. Los A. Halstead J. Bannister A. D'Santos C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 582-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight using an anti-DGKζ polyclonal antibody (23Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), anti-pRB polyclonal antibody C-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma), or anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science). Antibodies were captured using Protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Endogenous immunoprecipitates were then washed once with PIPkinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA), and 15 or 20% was resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for the DGK activity assay, whereas 85 or 80% was analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitates or total lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with anti-DGKζ polyclonal antibody, anti-pRB monoclonal antibody G3-245 (Pharmingen), anti-p107 polyclonal antibody C-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p130 polyclonal antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-cyclin E monoclonal antibody sc-248 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were stained with secondary antibodies (DAKO) and visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or Super Signal (Pierce). Affinity Purifications—GST-DGKζ (expressed in COS-7 cells) and GST fusion proteins of pRB, p107, and p130 (expressed in bacteria and induced with 200 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 200 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 4 μg of immobilized GST fusion proteins for 2 h at 4°C, and beads were then washed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. For DGK activity assays, equal amounts of GST-protein complexes were washed once in PIPkinase buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and assayed for DGK activity. For Western blotting, affinity-purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with an anti-DGKζ polyclonal antibody or anti-VSV monoclonal antibody P5D4 (Roche Applied Science). MCF7 lysate (450 μg) or 250 ng of eluted GST-pRB or GST-Cdc42 was incubated overnight with 100 μg of biotinylated TAT-DGKζ-MARCKS peptide (YARAAARQARAGKASKKKKRASFKRKSSKK) or TAT control peptide (YARAAARQARAG), which were immobilized on streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) and washed with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20). Affinity-purified pRB or GST fusion protein was visualized by immunoblotting. DGK Activity Assay—Immunoprecipitates, GST-protein complexes, or purified proteins were assayed for DGK activity as described by Divecha et al. (4Divecha N. Banfic H. Irvine R.F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3207-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Lipid vesicles were prepared by sonicating 1 nmol of dioleoylglycerol (from Sigma), 1 nmol of PIP (Biomol), 1 nmol of PI (Sigma), and 3 nmol of PA (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 10 min (GST pull-downs and immunoprecipitates) or 5 min (purified proteins) in PIPkinase buffer containing 10 μm cold ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 100 μl. Lipids were extracted with 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), followed by the addition of 125 μl of 2.4 m HCl and phase separation. Lipid extracts were dried and separated by thin layer chromatography (silica gel 60 TLC plates (Sigma) soaked in 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm potassium oxaloacetate and heat-activated) using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (45:35:7.5:2.5, v/v/v/v). Lipids were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using phosphoimaging. E2F Luciferase Activity Assay—C33A cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 250 μlof1× passive lysis buffer (Promega), and 50 μlwas used to measure first firefly luciferase and then Renilla luciferase activity using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was detected using a Wallac 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To control for transfection efficiency, firefly luciferase activity was corrected for Renilla luciferase activity. Preparation of Purified Proteins for DGK Activity Assay—In order to determine DGK activation as a result of direct protein-protein interaction (DGKζ and GST fusion proteins of pocket proteins), the following purification steps were performed. HA-DGKζ was immunoprecipitated from 600 μg of COS-7 lysate and eluted from the beads using elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) containing 1 mg/ml HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA). Purified GST fusion proteins were eluted using GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm glutathione) and quantified using a bovine serum albumin standard on a Coomassie-stained gel. Purified HA-DGKζ was incubated with GST fusion proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. All samples contained equal amounts of GST elution buffer and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin. Generation of pRB–/–MEFs Stably Expressing DGKζ and Cell Cycle Analysis after γ-Irradiation—To immortalize mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and to generate cells stably expressing DGKζ, LZRS-TBX2-iresGFP (kindly provided by M. van Lohuizen (The Netherlands Cancer Institute)) or DGKζ-pBabe constructs were transfected in Phoenix packaging cells and used to transduce MEFs. Ecotropic retroviral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and incubated with 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) before adding to the cells. Viral supernatants were diluted 6 h after transduction. After immortalizing cells with TBX2, cells were transduced with DGKζ and, after 48 h, were selected with 200 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). For irradiation experiments, 50,000 cells were plated per well (6-well plates). Two days after seeding, cells were γ-irradiated using a 137Cs radiation source. 30 min after irradiation, cells were treated with nocodazole (1 μg/ml; Sigma) for 30 h. For cell cycle analysis, cells were trypsinized, fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 200 μlof phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase. Cell cycle distribution was determined by FACScan analysis and quantified using FCS Express 2. DGKζ Interacts with pRB, p107, and p130 in Vitro—To determine which lipid kinases interact with pRB, we used three different GST-pRB fusion proteins (Fig. 1B): the large pocket region that includes the small pocket domain and the C terminus (GST-pRB), the small pocket domain (GST-pRB(A+B)), and the pRB C terminus (GST-pRB(C)). These GST fusion proteins were used to affinity-purify lipid kinases from lysates of rat brain, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, or human MCF7 breast cancer cells. GST-Cdc42 served as a negative control for nonspecific binding. Fig. 2A shows that, in each cell lysate, each of the three pRB constructs bound three different lipid kinase activities (i.e. PI-kinase (yielding PIP), PIP-kinase (yielding PIP2), and DGK (yielding PA)), as assessed by 32P incorporation into the respective lipid products. The ability of pRB to interact with PIP-kinases is in agreement with our previous data (19Divecha N. Roefs M. Los A. Halstead J. Bannister A. D'Santos C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 582-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we focus on the novel finding that pRB binds to DGK. Fig. 2A shows that rat brains contain much more pRB-binding lipid kinase activity than MEL and MCF7 cells. In each of the cell lysates, GST-pRB(A+B) (the small pocket of pRB; lanes 2, 6, and 10) shows slightly less binding of each of lipid kinase activities than the other two pRB constructs (large pocket and C terminus) (for rat brain, this is better seen at the lower exposure; lanes 1*–4*). Thus, in three different cell lysates, three different lipid kinases of the canonical PI cycle (i.e. a DGK, PI-kinase, and PIP-kinase) all associate with GST-pRB fusion proteins. These data suggest that pRB may act as a scaffold protein in order to regulate nuclear PI signaling. To define which DGK isoform interacts with pRB, we used GST-pRB to extract DGKs from lysates of COS-7 cells overexpressing VSV-tagged DGKα, DGKζ, or DGKθ. Interaction between DGKs and GST-pRB was assessed using in vitro DGK activity assays and Western blotting. GST-pRB extracted 30-fold more DGK activity from lysates expressing DGKζ compared with those expressing DGKα or DGKθ (Fig. 2B, top, compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 5), although less DGKζ activity was present in the lysates compared with DGKα or DGKθ activity (compare lane 10 with lanes 9 and 11). Similarly, more DGKζ bound to GST-pRB than DGKα or DGKθ, as revealed by Western blotting, despite the lower expression of DGKζ in cell lysates (Fig. 2B, bottom). These data indicate that DGKζ is the predominant isotype that binds to pRB. To assess if DGKζ activity was required for interaction with pRB, we mutated a conserved glycine residue within the ATP binding site. This mutant showed less than 1% of the activity in vitro but was still able to interact with GST-pRB as well as the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). To more carefully examine the region of pRB where DGKζ binds, we performed a titration experiment in which increasing amounts of GST fusion proteins were used to bind DGKζ from COS-7 lysates. DGKζ has similar affinities for GST-pRB and GST-pRB(C) (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 3 and 8), whereas GST-pRB(A+B) only weakly bound to DGKζ. The substantial DGK activity bound to GST-pRB(A+B) from endogenous cell systems (Fig. 2A) compared with the small amounts of DGKζ bound to pRB(A+B) found on Western blot may be due to differences in the assays utilized. Based on Western blot analysis, we conclude that the C terminus of pRB is the major binding site for DGKζ. Since pRB is a member of the family of pocket proteins that also include p107 and p130, we assessed if p107 and p130 also interact with DGKζ. Since GST-p130 and DGKζ have the same molecular weight, we used lysates expressing GFP-DGKζ to discriminate between them on SDS-PAGE. Like GST-pRB, GST-p107 and GST-p130 also bound to GFP-DGKζ (Fig. 3A). However, GST-p130 extracted less DGKζ compared with GST-pRB and GST-p107, which might reflect the lower amount of GST protein used or that p130 has a lower affinity for DGKζ. These data show that DGKζ can interact with all members of the pRB pocket protein family. DGKζ Binds pRB, p107, and p130 in Cells—To demonstrate that DGKζ binds to pRB also in cells, we expressed pRB and FLAG-tagged DGKζ (FLAG-DGKζ), alone or in combination, in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated the lipid kinase from cell lysates using a specific anti-FLAG antibody. pRB and DGKζ were expressed in total lysates of transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B, bottom), and FLAG-DGKζ could be immunoprecipitated. However, pRB was only detected in the immunoprecipitates from lysates expressing both pRB and DGKζ (Fig. 3B, top). We also tested the pRB family members p107 and p130 for DGKζ binding in cells. Total lysates revealed that DGKζ, p107, and p130 were expressed in transfected HEK293T cells (bottom of Fig. 3, C and D). Similar to pRB, p107 and p130 were only detected in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates when they were co-expressed with FLAG-DGKζ (top of Fig. 3, C and D). The interaction of p130 with DGKζ was lower in both the in vitro GST pull-downs and in the co-immunoprecipitations, suggesting that p130 binds DGKζ with a lower affinity than pRB and p107. To demonstrate that endogenous DGKζ and pRB interact with each other, we immunoprecipitated DGKζ from MEL lysates and subjected the precipitate to immunoblotting with a pRB-specific antibody. pRB was present in the DGKζ immunoprecipitate but not in a control precipitate (Fig. 4A, top). Fig. 4A (bottom) confirms the presence of DGK activity and the presence of DGKζ protein in the DGKζ immunoprecipitate but not in the control precipitate. To successfully immunoprecipitate pRB and determine DGKζ co-immunoprecipitation, we used MEL lysates of differentiated cells that contain pRB predominantly in the hypophosphorylated status, the status of pRB that binds DGKζ (see Fig. 6). A small fraction of pRB was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4B, top), and DGKζ protein and DGK activity were specifically co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4B, bottom). These results indicate that endogenous pRB and DGKζ interact with each other.FIGURE 6DGKζ binds to hypophosphorylated pRB. GST-DGKζ was isolated from COS-7 cells and incubated with lysates of SAOS-2 cells that were transfected with pRB and/or cyclin E as the indicated constructs. Affinity-purified proteins (lanes 1–6) and total lysates representing one-twentieth of input lysates (lanes 7–9) were subjected to Western blotting using a pRB-specific (top), GST-specific (bottom left), or cyclin E-specific antibody (cycE, top right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The MARCKS-PSD of DGKζ Is a pRB-binding Site—The MARCKS-PSD of DGKζ has previously been shown to be a major determinant for the localization of DGKζ in the nucleus (15Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that the MARCKS-PSD may be important in the interaction of DGKζ with pRB. To test this hypothesis, we tested the interaction between pRB and a DGKζ mutant in which the MARCKS domain was deleted (DGKζ-ΔMARCKS). Whereas both wild type (wtDGKζ) and DGKζ-ΔMARCKS were equally expressed (Fig. 5A, compare lane 17 with lane 18), DGKζ-ΔMARCKS was hardly detectable compared with wtDGKζ in the GST-pRB fusion protein precipitates (lanes 5–8). Since the MARCKS-PSD contains a large number of basic amino acids that might be important for electrostatic interaction between pRB and DGKζ, we tested a DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD mutant in which all basic amino acids of the nuclear localization signal were substituted for alanines (DGKζ-K/R→A) for pRB binding. Similar to the MARCKS-PSD deletion mutant, the DGKζ-K/R→A mutant failed to interact with GST-pRB (lanes 9–12), although the protein was expressed at a higher level compared with wtDGKζ (compare lane 19 with lane 17). To test whether the DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD was sufficient to mediate interaction with pRB, we used a biotinylated DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD peptide to affinity-purify pRB from MCF7 cell lysates. The DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD peptide bound to pRB, whereas a biotinylated control peptide was unable to bind pRB (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the interaction between full-length DGKζ and GST-pRB was inhibited by the DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD peptide (Fig. 5C, lane 3) but not by the control peptide (Fig. 5C, lane 4). Together, these results indicate that the DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD is important in mediating the interaction between pRB and DGKζ. The MARCKS-PSD of DGKζ Binds to pRB Directly—To determine whether pRB directly binds to DGKζ, we tested whether purified and eluted GST-pRB could be extracted by the biotinylated DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD peptide. Purified GST-pRB specifically bound to the DGKζ-MARCKS-PSD peptide coupled to streptavidin-agarose (Fig. 5D), whereas GST-Cdc42 did not bind. GST-pRB was not extracted by a control peptide. These results suggest that pRB binds to the MARCKS-PSD of DGKζ directly. DGKζ Binds Hypophosphorylated pRB—pRB regulates cell cycle progression through its interaction with the transcription factor E2F. During G1, pRB exists in a hypophosphorylated state and can bind to and inactivate E2F. When cells progress to S-phase, pRB becomes highly phosphorylated by cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, which leads to the release of E2F, enabling E2F-mediated transcription of genes required for S-phase progression (24Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In total cell lysates, pRB is present in both the low and highly phosphorylated state (see the doublet in Fig. 3B, bottom), whereas only one band is detectable in the DGKζ immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3B, top), suggesting that the interaction between DGKζ and pRB may be dependent on the phosphorylation status of pRB. To further test this, we used the osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2 that lacks functional pRB. When pRB is overexpressed in SAOS-2 cells, it is not phosphorylated (Fig. 6, lane 7) and causes a cell cycle arrest. Co-expression of pRB with cyclin E, however, leads to hyperphosphorylation of pRB (lane 8), which attenuates the pRB-mediated cell cycle arrest (25Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-"

Concurrently, electron microscopic data indicated that nuclear pore morphology is not overtly altered in apoptotic cells, raising the question of how caspases may deactivate nuclear pore function while leaving its overall structure largely intact. To clarify this issue we have analyzed the fate of all known nuclear pore proteins during apoptotic cell death. Our results show that only two of more than 20 nuclear pore core structure components, namely Nup93 and Nup96, are caspase targets. Both proteins are cleaved near their N terminus, disrupting the domains required for interaction with other nucleoporins actively involved in transport and providing the permeability barrier but dispensable for maintaining the nuclear pore scaffold. Caspase-mediated proteolysis of only few nuclear pore complex components may exemplify a general strategy of apoptotic cells to efficiently disable huge macromolecular machines.

By cleavage of a limited number of structural and regulatory proteins, they produce changes in cellular morphology and metabolism that are hallmarks of the apoptotic process. In the nucleus such changes include pronounced chromatin condensation, massive nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and alterations in nuclear shape (2Robertson J.D. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. J. Struct.

Many nucleoporins are components of distinct subcomplexes that are arranged around the central pore channel in 8-fold rotational symmetry. The vertebrate Nup93 subcomplex, embedded within the NPC core, harbors Nup205, Nup188, and Nup93 (10Grandi P. Dang T. Panté N. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Forbes D. Hurt E. Mol. Biol.

Fibers on the cytoplasmic face consist of RanBP2/Nup358 (27Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol.

The fibrils emanating from the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC are longer and interconnected at their distal ends, forming a structure called the nuclear basket (34Ris H.

Nup153 in turn binds to the NPC by direct interaction with the Nup160 subcomplex (16Vasu S. Shah S. Orjalo A. Park M. Fischer W.H. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Several nucleoporins contain domains characterized by phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats separated by polar spacer sequences (42Strawn L.A. Shen T. Shulga N. Goldfarb D.S. Wente S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Vectorial movement across the NPC requires direct interaction between the translocating molecules and these FG repeat regions (43Fried H. Kutay U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). At the same time, FG repeats have been proposed to form a meshwork within the pore channel that acts as the permeability barrier for macromolecules that need to be retained either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm (44Ribbeck K. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In mammals, the FG repeat nucleoporins comprise Nup62, Nup58, Nup54, NLP1/CG1, Pom121, RanBP2/Nup358, Nup214, Nup153, and Nup98.So far, seven nucleoporins have been investigated in cells undergoing apoptosis, including the peripheral RanBP2, Nup214, Nup153, and Tpr, the transmembrane proteins Pom121 and gp120, and the NPC core component Nup62. Of these, only Nup62 and gp120 were found not degraded, whereas the other five proteins were described as targets for caspase-mediated proteolysis (5Ferrando-May E. Cordes V. Biller I. Görlich D.

The overall morphology of such apoptotic NPCs appears strikingly preserved in electron microscopic images, suggesting that other core nucleoporins, in addition to Nup62 and gp210, might be spared by caspases and thus keep up an NPC scaffold (45Buendia B. Santa-Maria A. Courvalin J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J.

J. 1994; 26: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, it was also shown that the ability of the NPC to act as a permeability barrier for certain macromolecules and to sustain nucleocytoplasmic transport of others is compromised during apoptosis (4Faleiro L. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5Ferrando-May E. Cordes V. Biller I. Görlich D. Mirkovic J. Nicotera P.

Cell Res. 2004; 293: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These observations cannot be explained exclusively by cleavage of peripheral nucleoporins, indicating that in fact some NPC core components might also be altered in the course of cell death.Because of the limited number of nucleoporins analyzed so far, it has not been possible yet to correlate the data regarding morphology and function of the apoptotic NPC on the one hand to the preservation or loss of individual nucleoporins on the other. The recent progress in the elucidation of NPC protein composition and the availability of increasing numbers of nucleoporin-specific antibodies have therefore prompted us to study the fate of all NPC components during apoptosis. To also clarify how different cell death signaling cascades might affect individual nucleoporins, we used two apoptosis model systems in which cells are exposed to drugs that initiate the apoptotic response on either the one or other side of the nuclear envelope.In the first model, apoptosis was triggered at the plasma membrane by stimulation with the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which induces apoptosis by binding to two death-domain containing TRAIL receptors (48Wiley S.R.

As an apoptotic insult directed to the nucleus we chose etoposide, an inhibitor of type II DNA topoisomerases. Treatment with etoposide results in the accumulation of DNA double-stranded breaks that act as potent apoptotic triggers (50Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar).Our results indicate that except for Nup93 and Nup96, which are processed in both models at the onset of the apoptotic execution phase, the NPC core structure is not subject to caspase-mediated degradation. Conversely, most nucleoporins that are peripherally attached to the cytoplasmic and nuclear side of the NPC are favored caspase substrates, although they respond differently to the different apoptotic stimuli with respect to the timing and extent of their degradation. These data provide a comprehensive analysis of the apoptotic fate of a supramolecular assembly, illustrating how the apoptotic machinery may proceed in shutting down crucial cellular functions by targeting strategic sites within complex multimeric structures.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Induction of Apoptosis—HeLa 229 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum.

Apoptosis was induced by etoposide or TRAIL 4 h after release from the second metabolic block.FACS Analysis—HeLa 229 cells were collected by gently scraping them off the culture dish in ice-cold PBS. Following washes and resuspension in ice-cold PBS, the cells were fixed by dropwise addition of a 4-fold excess of ice-cold ethanol under gentle stirring and stored overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A. After the addition of 40 μg/ml propidium iodide, the cells were analyzed by FACS in a Becton Dickinson LSR flow cytometer. At least 1 × 104 cells were sorted per FACS experiment. The measurements were repeated three times.Quantification of Apoptosis by Scoring Condensed Nuclei—HeLa cell cultures were stained with a mixture of the membrane-permeable DNA dye H-33342 (500 ng/ml; Molecular Probes) and the membrane-impermeable DNA dye SYTOX (500 nm; Molecular Probes). Cells with intact plasma membrane and characteristically condensed or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. The data were collected from a minimum of three independent experiments.Quantification of Oligonucleosomal DNA Fragmentation—The production of histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) was assessed with the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were lysed, and the cytoplasmic fraction was recovered by centrifugation. Nucleosomal concentration in this fraction was determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using histone-specific antibodies preadsorbed to microtiter plates and peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against DNA. Peroxidase activity was measured photometrically. The experiments were run in triplicate.Measurement of Caspase Activity—Caspase-3-like activity was measured as the degree of DEVD-afc (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-aspartylaminofluoro-methylcoumarine; Bachem Biochemica) cleavage and was assayed essentially as described earlier (52Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 53Leist M. Volbracht C. Kuhnle S. Fava E. Ferrando-May E. Nicotera P. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 750-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2,1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100. The fluorimetric assay was carried out in microtiter plates with a substrate concentration of 40 μm and a total protein amount of 3-4 μg. Cleavage of DEVD-afc was followed in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS) over a period of 20 min at 37 °C with λex = 390 nm and λem = 505 nm. The activity was calibrated with afc standard solutions. The measurements were run in triplicate and repeated at least three times.Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts—For the preparation of protein extracts, HeLa cell cultures were placed on ice, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mix; Roche Applied Science) and dithiothreitol (1 mm) were added directly to the growth media. The cells were then gently scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman, washed in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 95 °C lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min.SDS Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was according to Thomas and Kornberg (54Thomas J.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellullose using a wet blot chamber (Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Cell), and the filters were then incubated in TNT buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% milk powder at room temperature for 1 h. Incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C was in TNT with milk overnight. Filter washings were in TNT alone. Incubations with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were in TNT with milk at room temperature for 1 h. The filter strip with the biotinylated molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad) was incubated separately with horseradish peroxidase-coupled avidin for 30 min at room temperature. Immunoblots were visualized with a chemiluminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000; Fujifilm), and the images were evaluated with the AIDA software package (Fujifilm). The signal intensity was integrated over the signal area and corrected for the background intensity. The percentage of cleavage was calculated as the ratio between the integrated signal intensities of the predominant proteolytic products and the intact polypeptides.Antibodies—Antibodies used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1; those listed in bold letters have been used for the immunoblots shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

The time course of apoptosis was characterized by assessing three characteristic end points, namely (i) chromatin condensation, (ii) activation of executor caspases, and (iii) oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation.In this model, most cells displayed the typical apoptotic morphology within 3 h after stimulation. This was paralleled by an increase of caspase-3/7-like activity and enrichment of oligonucleosomal DNA fragments (Fig. 1), collectively indicating a highly synchronous onset of the apoptotic execution routine.FIGURE 1TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were treated with 300 ng/ml TRAIL. At indicated time points, apoptosis was assessed by measurement of three different end points. A, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and inspected microscopically. Cells with condensed nuclei were scored as apoptotic. B, caspase 3/7-like activity was determined by fluorimetric detection of DEVD-afc cleavage. C, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for histone-bound DNA fragments. The bar diagrams indicate increase in oligonucleosome concentration relative to untreated cells. The data are the means ± standard deviation from triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the induction of apoptosis directly within the nucleus, we used etoposide, a well characterized inducer of DNA damage. In contrast to the more rapid response to TRAIL, etoposide-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells has been reported to occur in the time range of 24-48 h (57Karpinich N.O. Tafani M. Rothman R.J.

Cell. 2003; 14: 4250-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is partly due to the cell cycle dependence of etoposide toxicity, which is highest during the S phase (59Chow K.C. Ross W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3119-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To accelerate the onset of etoposide-induced apoptosis, thereby allowing a more direct comparison between the two models, we first synchronized HeLa cells by a double thymidine block, which arrests the cells at the G1/S phase transition. After releasing these cells from the second block, most of them synchronously traversed the S phase, as shown by FACS analysis (Fig. 2A). Their response to treatment with 50 μm etoposide was then compared with that of a nonsynchronized cell population. 4 h after drug addition, the synchronized population displayed a 5-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells compared with nonsynchronized cells. This was paralleled by the induction of caspase 3/7 activity and a pronounced increment in oligonucleosomal fragmentation (Fig. 2, B-D). The latter was not observed to increase further, most likely because of the release of oligonucleosomes in the culture medium in this apoptosis model. After 6 h of etoposide treatment the level of apoptosis measured in synchronized HeLa cells was similar to that of cells stimulated with TRAIL for 2 h, whereas in the nonsynchronized population a similar degree of nuclear condensat"

AE2 polypeptides regulate pHi, chloride concentration, cell volume, and transepithelial ion transport in many tissues. Although the AE2a isoform has been extensively studied, the function and regulation of the other AE2 N-terminal variant mRNAs of mouse (AE2b1, AE2b2, AE2c1, and AE2c2) have not been examined. We now present an extended analysis of AE2 variant mRNA tissue distribution and function. We show in Xenopus oocytes that all AE2 variant polypeptides except AE2c2 mediated Cl– transport are subject to inhibition by acidic pHi and to activation by hypertonicity and NH+4. However, AE2c1 differs from AE2a, AE2b1, and AE2b2 in its alkaline-shifted pHo(50) (7.70 ± 0.11 versus 6.80 ± 0.05), suggesting the presence of a novel AE2a pH-sensitive regulatory site between amino acids 99 and 198. Initial N-terminal deletion mutagenesis restricted this site to the region between amino acids 120 and 150. Further analysis identified AE2a residues 127–129, 130–134, and 145–149 as jointly responsible for the difference in pHo(50) between AE2c1 and the longer AE2a, AE2b1, and AE2b2 polypeptides. Thus, AE2c1 exhibits a unique pHo sensitivity among the murine AE2 variant polypeptides, in addition to a unique tissue distribution.

Integrity of all PCR fragments and ligation sites was confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands. 4Primer sequences are available upon request. Tissue-specific Expression of AE2 Variant mRNA Transcripts as Detected by RT-PCR—Total RNA from freshly resected mouse stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon, liver, choroid plexus, heart, lung, uterus, and embryonic stem cells was prepared using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.). A mouse tissue total RNA panel for brain, embryo, kidney, ovary, spleen, testis, and thymus was purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Reverse transcription was performed with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Ambion, Inc.) using 1 μg of total RNA. 5% of the reaction volume was used for PCR with HotStart DNA polymerase (Qiagen Inc.) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl in the supplier's recommended buffer. The complete reaction mixtures were incubated at 95 °C for 15 min and then cycled through 45 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 2 min of annealing at 60 °C, and 2.5 min of elongation at 72 °C. A 7-min final extension at 72 °C was terminated by rapid cooling to room temperature. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide (GelDoc, Bio-Rad). Selected RT-PCR products of each AE2 variant transcript were purified and sequenced to confirm their molecular identities. PCR cycle number was adjusted for each tissue and for each AE2 variant mRNA, balancing the demands of low abundance transcript detection with the need to remain within or near the log-linear range of amplification for higher abundance transcripts. The upper limit for amplification was chosen as 38 cycles. Control PCR experiments using linearized purified AE2 cDNA templates in isolation and in an equimolar mixture showed that 1) amplification efficiencies of the forward primers unique to AE2a, AE2b1, and AE2b2 are similar, producing with their common reverse primer equivalent amounts of PCR products; and 2) the primer pair amplifying both the shorter AE2c1 and longer AE2c2 products underestimated AE2c2 abundance when in the presence of AE2c1. 5B.

RNase Protection Assay—The RNase protection assay (RPA) was conducted with the indicated amounts of total RNA (see Fig. 2E) from stomach or kidney using a PRAIII kit (Ambion, Inc.) with this modified hybridization step: the initial denaturation for 4 min at 95 °C was followed by 10 cycles of consecutive 10-min incubations at 65, 60, 56, 52, 48, 45, 48, 52, 56, 60, and 65 °C, with a final overnight incubation at 56 °C. Reaction products were electrophoresed on a denaturing 7 m urea and 8% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to blotting paper, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The plasmid used for RPA probe production was AE2a nt 1–927 (GenBank™ accession number J04036) in pCRII between the SP6 and T7 promoters. The 468-nt antisense probe included AE2a nt 460–927 plus flanking vector sequences, synthesized from the T7 promoter using a MAXIscript kit (Ambion, Inc.) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). This probe should protect identical 468-nt mRNA fragments of AE2a, AE2b1, and AE2b2 and 167-nt mRNA fragments of AE2c1 and AE2c2 (nt 761–927; GenBank™ accession number J04036). Unlabeled antisense and sense control probes were AE2a nt 1–927 plus flanking vector sequences, transcribed from the T7 or SP6 promoter using a MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Inc.). cRNA Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Capped mAE2 cRNAs were transcribed from linearized plasmids with a T7 MEGAscript kit and purified with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). cRNA integrity was tested by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, and cRNA concentration was estimated by the absorbance at 260 nm. Ovarian segments were excised from Xenopus laevis females anesthetized with 0.17% tricaine. The tissue was minced and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 2 mg/ml Type A collagenase (Roche Diagnostics) in ND96 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2,5 mm HEPES, and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and supplemented with 5 mg of gentamycin/100 ml. Stage V–VI oocytes were selected, manually defolliculated, and injected with 50 nl of cRNA or with H2O. The amount of cRNA injected per AE2 variant or mutant was titrated to approximate the activity of wild-type AE2a, producing efflux rate constants between 0.015 and 0.080 min–1 at pH 7.4. Injected oocytes were maintained at 19 °C in ND96 buffer in the continued presence of gentamycin and pyruvate until used for assays. 36Cl– Flux Assays in Xenopus Oocytes—For 36Cl– efflux assays, individual oocytes in Cl–-free medium (96 mm sodium isethionate, 2 mm potassium gluconate, 1.8 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm magnesium gluconate, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were injected with 50 nl of 260 mm Na36Cl (10,000–20,000 cpm; MP Biochemicals, Irvine, CA). After a recovery period of 5–10 min, the efflux essay was initiated by transferring individual oocytes to 6-ml borosilicate glass tubes containing 1 ml of ND96 buffer or other efflux solutions as described. 0.95 ml of efflux solution was removed at defined intervals and replaced with an equal volume of fresh efflux solution. Oocyte integrity was confirmed by a final efflux period in the presence of the anion transport inhibitor DIDS (200 μm). Each oocyte was lysed in 100 μl 1% SDS. Efflux samples and lysates were subjected to scintillation counting for 4 min such that the magnitude of two S.D. values was <5% of the sample mean. For hypertonic stimulation experiments, NaCl was added to the efflux medium. In some experiments, 20 mm NaCl was replaced with 20 mm NH4Cl. Measurements of pHo and pHi dependence of 36Cl– efflux were conducted as described previously (15Stewart A.K. Kerr N. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52664-52676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cl–/HCO–3 Exchange in Oocytes, Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 Cells, and EcR-293 Cells—Oocytes previously injected with H2O or cRNA were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm bis(carboxyethyl)carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) acetoxymethyl ester at room temperature, rinsed, and mounted in a 0.8-ml superfusion chamber on a microscope stage. Cl–/HCO–3 exchange was assessed by BCECF fluorescence ratio imaging of oocyte pHi changes during removal and restoration of superfusate [Cl–] (72 mm) in the presence of 5% CO2 and 24 mm HCO–3, with gluconate as the substituting anion (22Chernova M.N.

Data were acquired and analyzed with MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging, Chester, PA). dpHi/dt was measured from least-squares linear fits of initial slopes. EcR-293 cells stably expressing AE2b1 and AE2c1 (23Frische S. Zolotarev A.S. Kim Y.H. Praetorius J. Alper S. Nielsen S. Wall S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1163-F1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were grown on coverslips, incubated overnight in the absence or presence of the inducer ponasterone (5 μm), loaded for 30 min with 5 μm BCECF acetoxymethyl ester, and mounted on a microscope stage. Cl–/HCO–3 exchange was measured by BCECF fluorescence ratio imaging of 30–70 subconfluent cells imaged in single ×20 visual fields during Cl– removal and restoration in the presence of 5% CO2 and 24 mm HCO–3, with gluconate as the substituting anion. The AE2b2 and AE2c1 cDNAs subcloned into pcDNA3 were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells on glass coverslips using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the transfected cells on coverslips were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm BCECF acetoxymethyl ester and then mounted on a microscope stage. Cl–/HCO–3 exchange was measured as described above in single visual fields containing 60–90 cells. (AE2b2 was studied in transient transfectants because our stable EcR-293 cell lines had been made prior to publication of the AE2b2 sequence (6Lecanda J. Urtasun R. Medina J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).) Immunodetection of mAE2 Variant Polypeptides—Groups of 10 oocytes were solubilized at 4 °C in 1% Triton oocyte lysis buffer (10 μl/oocyte) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete® protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). After 30 min of intermittent shaking, the extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Clarified lysate was fractionated by SDS-8% PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. After incubation with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to the mAE2 C-terminal amino acids (aa) 1224–1237 shared by all AE2 variant polypeptides (8Stuart-Tilley A.K. Shmukler B.E. Brown D. Alper S.L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 946-959PubMed Google Scholar, 24Alper S.L. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Biemesderfer D. Shmukler B.E. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F601-F614PubMed Google Scholar), immobilized AE2 polypeptide was visualized on Eastman Kodak X-Omat film by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to mAE2b2 aa 1–11 was raised against the high pressure liquid chromatography-purified, N-terminally acetylated, C-terminally amidated peptide MDFLLRPQPEP(C). The immunizing antigen was peptide-coupled through its added C-terminal amidated Cys residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via 3-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. Immune serum was affinity-purified over a 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide methyl ester-coupled peptide antigen column. HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with AE2b2 and AE2c1 cDNAs as described above were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with the affinity-purified anti-AE2 antibodies in the presence of 12 μg/ml peptide antigen or irrelevant peptide as described previously (8Stuart-Tilley A.K.

Physiol. 1997; 273: F601-F614PubMed Google Scholar). Images were acquired with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 laser scanning confocal microscope. Tissue Distribution of mAE2 Variant mRNA Expression—The five mAE2 variant transcripts encode the five predicted AE2 polypeptides schematized in Fig. 1. We examined the tissue distribution of the transcripts encoding these five polypeptides. AE2a mRNA was detected in all 17 tissues screened by RT-PCR (Fig. 2, A–D). AE2b1 and AE2b2 were also detected in all tissues analyzed, with the single exception of spleen. Stomach mRNA levels of AE2b1 appeared to be approximately equivalent to those of AE2a. Colonic levels of AE2b1 appeared to be slightly less abundant than of those of AE2a. The apparent relative expression levels of AE2a, AEb1, and AE2b2 in mouse kidney (Fig. 2A) paralleled those detected by RT-PCR in rat kidney, in which most of the AE2b1 was from the inner stripe of the outer medulla. 6S. M. Wall, personal communication. Stomach was the only tissue studied that expressed substantial levels of AE2c1 mRNA. Trace AE2c1 expression was detected in liver, colon, choroid plexus, and uterus after 38 cycles of PCR with overexposure of gels (data not shown). AE2c2 expression was more widespread, with PCR products detected in all tissues examined except spleen, duodenum, brain, heart, and testis. 7Fig. 2 also shows, in choroid plexus and at lower abundance in kidney, ileum, colon, lung, uterus, and thymus, an RT-PCR product of the AE2c primer pair migrating above the AE2c2 band (under further characterization) (B. E. Shmukler and S. L. Alper, unpublished data). The AE2c2 mRNA abundance relative to AE2c1 in stomach (Fig. 2C) is likely an underestimate of the real value, as noted in control amplifications with this single AE2c primer pair (see “Materials and Methods”). The ability to detect AE2c transcripts by RPA was tested in mouse stomach and kidney (Fig. 2E). The structures of the AE2 variant transcripts do not permit design of a single RPA probe capable of detecting all five individual transcripts. Thus, the RPA probe was chosen to discriminate a single upper band representing combined AE2a, AE2b1, and AE2b2 and a single lower band of combined AE2c1 and AE2c2. The proportional signals detected in 10, 3, and 1 μg of stomach RNA demonstrate the quantitative nature of the RPA. The ratio of gastric AE2a/AE2b1/AE2b2 to AE2c1/AE2c2 detected by RPA (Fig. 2E) seemed lower than evidenced by RT-PCR (in which the differences are exponential) (Fig. 2, A and C). This difference highlights the potential pitfalls of comparing RT-PCRs not employing identical primer pairs. However, the kidney AE2c2 transcript clearly detected by a 38-cycle RT-PCR amplification (Fig. 2A) was virtually undetectable by RPA (Fig. 2E), emphasizing the role of RT-PCR in high sensitivity transcript detection. Four of the Five mAE2 Variant Polypeptides Are Functional in Xenopus Oocytes and in Mammalian Cells—All AE2 variant polypeptides (Fig. 1) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes previously injected with equivalent amounts of cRNA. The extensively studied AE2a polypeptide accumulated to lower levels than did the other AE2 variant polypeptides (Fig. 3A). 36Cl– efflux assays revealed that AE2b1 and AE2b2 mediated the highest rates of Cl–/Cl– exchange (Fig. 3B). AE2a and AE2c1 exhibited lower, roughly equivalent rates of anion transport. The AE2c1 polypeptide accumulated to higher levels compared with AE2a or any other AE2 variant. In contrast, AE2c2 mediated no detectable 36Cl– efflux (Fig. 3B), despite polypeptide accumulation comparable with that of the most active variants, AE2b1 and AE2b2 (Fig. 3A). Therefore, AE2c2 was not examined further in these studies. AE2c1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes also mediated Cl–/HCO–3 exchange (Fig. 3C), as was shown earlier for AE2a (25Jiang L. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C191-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously described immunodetection of muristerone-induced AE2b1 and AE2c1 overexpression in stably transfected EcR-293 cells (23Frische S. Zolotarev A.S. Kim Y.H. Praetorius J. Alper S. Nielsen S. Wall S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1163-F1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows immunodetection of AE2b2 in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells by antibodies to the common AE2 C-terminal peptide (upper panels) and to the AE2b2-specific N-terminal peptide (lower panels). Transient transfection of HEK-293 cells with cDNAs encoding AE2b2 or AE2c1 led to increased Cl–/HCO–3 exchange activity (Fig. 4, B and C). In addition, Cl–/HCO–3 exchange activity was induced by the muristerone analog ponasterone in clonal EcR-293 cell lines stably transfected with AE2b1 or AE2c1 (Fig. 4, D and E), consistent with the previously described parallel induction of heterologous AE2b1 and AE2c1 polypeptides (23Frische S.

Regulation of AE2 Variant Polypeptides by NH+4 and Hypertonicity—Murine AE2a, AE2b1, AE2b2, and AE2c1 were acutely regulated by NH+4 (Fig. 5, A and C) and hypertonicity (Fig. 5, B and C). 20 mm NH+4 stimulated AE2b1, AE2b2, and AE2c1 Cl–/Cl– exchange activity to a degree similar to that displayed by AE2a (17Chernova M.N. Stewart A.K. Jiang L. Friedman D.J. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1235-C1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NH+4 stimulation did not elicit Cl–/Cl– exchange activity by inactive AE2c2 (data not shown). A hypertonic bath (362 mosm) (17Chernova M.N. Stewart A.K. Jiang L. Friedman D.J. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1235-C1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also stimulated Cl–/Cl– exchange by all active AE2 variant polypeptides. Although AE2b2, AE2c1, and AE2a were stimulated to the same degree by hypertonicity, stimulation of AE2b1 was significantly lower (p < 0.01). Regulation of AE2 Variant Polypeptides by Intracellular and Extracellular pH—As shown previously for AE2a (13Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1344-C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 36Cl– efflux rate constants for all active AE2 variants were strongly and reversibly decreased by intracellular acidification with bath butyrate (Fig. 6, A–C). Rate constants in the presence of 40 mm butyrate normalized to rate constants in the absence of butyrate were similar for AE2a and all active variants (Fig. 6C). Regulation of Cl–/Cl– exchange rates by pHo revealed a novel property of AE2c1. Although AE2a, AE2b1, and AE2b2 demonstrated similar pHo(50) values (Fig. 6, D–F), the pHo(50) for AE2c1 (equivalent to the hypothetical AE2a deletion mutant ΔN198) was significantly alkaline-shifted (pHo(50) = 7.7 ± 0.12 for AE2c1 (n = 29) versus 6.80 ± 0.05 for AE2a (n = 25)). This finding was unexpected in view of the wild-type pHo(50) values for AE2a N-terminal deletion mutants ΔN99 and ΔN310 (12Zhang Y. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. J. Biol.

Moreover, all previous N-terminal cytoplasmic domain mutations in AE2 that altered pHo sensitivity shifted the pHo(50) to more acidic rather than more alkaline values (13Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N.

However, the physiological function of centaurin-α1 is still not understood. Here we have shown that transient expression of centaurin-α1 in COS-7 cells results in specific activation of ERK, and the activation is inhibited by co-expression of a dominant negative form of Ras. We have also found that a mutant form of centaurin-α1 that is unable to bind PIP3 fails to induce ERK activation and that a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibits centaurin-α1-dependent ERK activation. Furthermore, transient knockdown of centaurin-α1 by small interfering RNAs results in reduced ERK activation after epidermal growth factor stimulation in T-REx 293 cells. These results suggest that centaurin-α1 contributes to ERK activation in growth factor signaling, linking the PI3K pathway to the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway through its ability to interact with PIP3.

Extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors, induce sequential activation of Ras, Raf-1 MAP kinase kinase kinase, MEK MAP kinase kinase, and ERK MAP kinase. It is known that there are two isoforms of ERK, ERK1 and ERK2, and they phosphorylate and activate various transcription factors, such as Elk-1 and Elk-2. These transcription factors regulate expression of diverse genes that relates to the proliferation and growth of the cells.A previous large scale functional cDNA screening that was performed to identify molecules involved in the MAP kinase signaling pathways identified many potential activators of the MAP kinase cascades, which include known activators, such as the MAP kinase kinase kinase family molecules, molecules with functions not previously linked to the MAP kinase pathways, and molecules with no previously revealed functions (8Matsuda A. Suzuki Y. Honda G. Muramatsu S. Matsuzaki O. Nagano Y. Doi T. Shimotohno K. Harada T. Nishida E. Hayashi H. Sugano S.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Centaurin-α1 was originally identified as a PIP3-binding protein (10Hammonds-Odie L.P. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Blader I.J.

Its N-terminal region contains a zinc finger motif that is highly homologous to the ARF (ADP ribosylation factor)-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) domain. Recently, it was reported that this potential ARF-GAP domain exhibited GAP activity for ARF6 in mammalian cells (12Venkateswarlu K. Brandom K.G. Lawrence J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6205-6208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of centaurin-α1 contains two PH domains, which have been reported to bind PIP3 (13Tanaka K. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Sawda T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Iwasaki S. Kaibuchi K. Kanaho Y.

The expression of centaurin-α1 is ubiquitous and especially high in the brain. The distribution of centaurin-α1 in the cell is concentrated in the nucleus (13Tanaka K. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Sawda T.

Despite such information, the physiological function of centaurin-α1 is still unknown.In this study, we showed that centaurin-α1 can activate ERK, and this activation needs the PI3K-dependent recruitment of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane. We also showed that centaurin-α1 contributes to ERK activation induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 293 cells. These results indicate that centaurin-α1 plays a role in the growth factor signaling upstream of the ERK MAP kinase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Plasmids—Anti-c-Myc antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

The total amount of DNA was adjusted using pSRα-HA, pSRα-Myc, or pcDNA3.1(+) vector.EGF Stimulation—3 h after transfection using Lipofectamine Plus reagent, the medium was exchanged to DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated for 18 h. Thereafter, the cells were cultured in low serum medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.35% glucose and 1% heat-inactivated horse serum) for 20 h. The cells were stimulated with 30 nm EGF for 2 min at 37 °C.Kinase Assays and Immunoblotting—21 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were lysed and immune complex kinase assay was performed as previously described (17Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The following proteins were used as substrates: myelin basic protein for ERK2 and ERK5, glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1–79) for c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and glutathione S-transferase-ATF2-(1–96) for p38. After SDS-PAGE, radioactivity was analyzed using an image analyzer (Bio-Rad). The samples were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA, anti-GFP, or anti-Myc antibodies. Immunoblotting was also performed as previously described (17Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Cell Staining—Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. The coverslips were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Fluorescence images were observed using a Confocal Microscope (Bio-Rad).Lipid Delivery—Synthetic phospholipids PI(3,4,5)P3 (diC16) and PI(4,5)P2 (diC16) (Echelon) were resolved in water at 300 μm and mixed with 100 μm histone (Echelon) for 5 min. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GFP-fused centaurin-α1 were treated with histone-phospholipid complexes diluted 1:10 with normal culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum). After 2 min, the cells were fixed, and fluorescence images were observed.Luciferase Assays—293-EBNA cells were seeded into 5% fetal calf serum-containing DMEM in a 96-well cell culture plate to a final density of 1 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Thereafter, the cells were transfected with 50 ng of pcDNA3.1-human centaurin-α1, 60 ng of pFR-Luc (Stratagene), 0.25 ng of pFA2-Elk-1 (Stratagene), and 5 ng of siRNA expression plasmid or an empty vector in each well using FuGENE6. Twenty-four h after transfection, the reporter activity was measured using PicaGene LT2.0 (Toyo Ink) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Establishment of Cell Lines Expressing siRNA for Centaurin-α1—The siRNA expression plasmids were introduced into T-REx 293 cells using FuGENE 6. Twenty-four h after transfection, the medium was exchanged to DMEM containing 1 μg/ml puromycin and 5% fetal calf serum. Seven days later, the puromycin-resistant cells were collected and used as cell lines in which siRNAs of human centaurin-α1 were induced by doxycycline.Quantitative Analysis of Centaurin-α1 mRNA—The quantitative real-time PCR reaction was performed with an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of dual fluorophore-labeled probe for human centaurin-α1 is 5′-FAM-AGC GTG GCC GGG ACA ACG G-TAMRA-3′, and PCR primers for human centaurin-α1 are 5′-GGG TAC CGT GAG GGT TTT CTC-3′and 5′-GCA CAA ACT TCC GGC TCA AA-3′. The sequence of dual fluorophore-labeled probe for human β-actin is 5′-FAM-ATC AAG ATC ATT GCT CCT CCT GAG CGC-TAMRA-3′, and PCR primers for β-actin are 5′-CCT GGC ACC CAG CAC AAT-3′ and 5′-GCC GAT CCA CAC GGA GTA CT-3′.RESULTSCentaurin-α1 Activates ERK Specifically—In the previous report, it has been shown that overexpression of human centaurin-α1 can activate ERK in mammalian cells (9Harada T. Matsuzaki O. Hayashi H. Sugano S. Matsuda A. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To examine whether this activation is specific for the ERK MAP kinase cascade among the four major MAP kinase cascades, HA epitope-tagged or GFP-fused centaurin-α1 was co-expressed with four kinds of Myc-tagged MAP kinases, ERK2, ERK5, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or p38 in COS-7 cells, and the activity of these MAP kinases was measured by in vitro kinase assays. As a result, only ERK2 showed the enhanced kinase activity when co-expressed with centaurin-α1 (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that centaurin-α1 is a specific activator of ERK among four MAP kinases.Ras Is Involved in the Activation of ERK by Centaurin-α1—It is known that Ras, a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein, activates the Raf-MEK-ERK kinase pathway. To examine whether Ras is involved in the activation of ERK by centaurin-α1, we co-transfected COS-7 cells with centaurin-α1 and each of four kinds of dominant negative forms of low molecular weight G-proteins Ras, Cdc42, Rho, and Rac and measured the activity of ERK MAP kinase. As a result, centaurin-α1 failed to activate ERK when co-expressed with a dominant negative form of Ras (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, dominant negative forms of other low molecular weight G-proteins did not affect the activation of ERK by centaurin-α1 (Fig. 1B). A MEK inhibitor U0126 also inhibited the activation of ERK by centaurin-α1. These results indicate that the activation of ERK by the overexpression of centaurin-α1 in COS-7 cells is mediated by Ras.PH Domains in Centaurin-α1 Are Important for ERK Activation—Centaurin-α1 has two PH domains in its N-terminal region. It has been reported that the PH domains are necessary for the ability of centaurin-α1 to bind PIP3 (13Tanaka K. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Sawda T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Iwasaki S. Kaibuchi K. Kanaho Y. Shirai T. Terada Y. Kimura K. Nagata S. Fukui Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, the RC1RC2 mutant form of centaurin-α1, in which Arg-149 and Arg-273 in the PH domains are mutated to Cys, is no longer recruited to the plasma membrane after EGF stimulation (18Tanaka K. Horiguchi K. Yosida T. Takeda M. Fujisawa H. Takeuchi K. Umeda M. Kato S. Ihara S. Nagahara S. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3919-3922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the PH domains in the activation of ERK by centaurin-α1, we constructed the RC1RC2 mutant and examined its ability to activate ERK. Overexpression of the RC1RC2 mutant resulted in much weaker activation of ERK than that of wild-type centaurin-α1 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2A). To investigate the localization of centaurin-α1 in the cell and to study the role of the PH domain for the translocation of centaurin-α1 by EGF stimulation, COS-7 cells were transfected with a GFP-fused form of wild-type or RC1RC2 mutant centaurin-α1. Before and after EGF stimulation, we determined their subcellular localization using the laser scanning confocal microscope. Before the stimulation, both wild-type and the RC1RC2 mutant centaurin-α1 largely localized to the nucleus and a small part of wild-type centaurin-α1 localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). After the stimulation, although wild-type centaurin-α1 was strongly recruited to the plasma membrane, the RC1RC2 mutant did not change their localization (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the recruitment of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane, which is regulated by its PH domains, is important for the activation of ERK in COS-7 cells.FIGURE 2The RC1RC2 mutant fails to phosphorylate ERK and is not recruited to the plasma membrane by EGF stimulation. A, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged ERK2 and the indicated amounts of either Myc-tagged centaurin-α1 or the Myc-tagged RC1RC2 mutant. 21 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and the cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphorylated ERK and anti-Myc antibodies. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with either GFP-tagged centaurin-α1 or the RC1RC2 mutant. 21 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 20 h and stimulated with EGF (30 nm) for 2 min. GFP-tagged proteins were imaged by confocal microscope before and after EGF stimulation.

We therefore examined the effect of a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, on this centaurin-α1-dependent activation of ERK. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with centaurin-α1 and ERK and treated with LY294002. Immunoblot analysis showed that LY294002 is able to inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). This indicates that PI3K activity is required for the activation of ERK induced by centaurin-α1. To investigate the role of PI3K activity on the subcellular localization of centaurin-α1, COS-7 cells expressing GFP-fused centaurin-α1 were treated with 20 μm LY294002. Although a small part of GFP-fused centaurin-α1 localized to the plasma membrane in the absence of LY294002, centaurin-α1 failed to localize to the plasma membrane in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the translocation of wild-type centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane by EGF stimulation was not detected in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 3C). A MEK inhibitor U0126 did not inhibit the recruitment of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the EGF-dependent recruitment of centaurin-α1 requires PI3K activation but not ERK activation. We also demonstrated that exogenous PIP3 is able to induce the translocation of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane, whereas PI(4,5)P2 does not induce such translocation (Fig. 3D). Without the histone carrier, phosphoinositides do not permeate the cell membrane (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the PI3K- and PIP3-dependent recruitment of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane is required for the activation of ERK induced by centaurin-α1.FIGURE 3PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK by centaurin-α1 and translocation of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane. A, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged centaurin-α1 and Myc-tagged ERK2, and the cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of LY294002. 21 h after the transfection, the phosphorylation of ERK was detected by immunoblotting analysis. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with GFP-fused centaurin-α1 in the absence (left panel) or presence (right panel) of LY294002 (20 μm). 15 h after transfection, the subcellular localization of GFP-fused centaurin-α1 was detected by confocal microscope. Arrowheads indicate the regions of membrane localization of GFP-tagged centaurin-α1. C, 15 h after the transfection of COS-7 cells with GFP-fused centaurin-α1, the cells were stimulated with EGF (30 nm) alone, EGF with LY294002 (20 μm), or EGF with U0126 (20 μm). D, 15 h after transfection of COS-7 cells with GFP-fused centaurin-α1, the cells were exposed to PIP3 (30 μm) alone, PIP3 with histone carrier (10 μm), or PI(4,5)P2 (30 μm) with histone carrier.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Down-regulation of Centaurin-α1 by siRNA Suppresses the Activation of ERK by EGF—To study the function of endogenous centaurin-α1, we employed the siRNA approach. For the purpose of screening the sequences of siRNA that have an ability to knock down the expression of centaurin-α1 mRNA, 293-EBNA cells were co-transfected with each of the siRNA expression plasmids, a centaurin-α1 expression plasmid, pFR-Luc, and pFA2-Elk-1. As a result, we found that two sequences (si3 and si5) of 25 sequences we tested were able to suppress the reporter gene activity to less than half of that in the control experiment in which the empty vector was used instead of an siRNA expression vector (Fig. 4). The other 23 sequences including si4 had little or no effect on the reporter activity (Fig. 4 and data not shown).FIGURE 4Activation of Elk-1 induced by overexpression of centaurin-α1 is suppressed by siRNA of centaurin-α1. A, 293-EBNA cells were co-transfected with centaurin-α1, pFR-Luc, and pFA2-Elk-1, and each of four shRNA (si3, si4, si5, and mock) expression vectors. 16 h later, the cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured. Values are means ± S.E. from three experiments. B, sequences of shRNAs that are transcribed from each shRNA expression vector are described. The numbers in parentheses show the corresponding positions in the coding region of centaurin-α1 that is targeted by each transcript.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We tried to obtain 293-EBNA stable cell lines that constitutively express the double-stranded RNA having the sequence si3, si4, or si5. Although we were able to establish si4-expressing cell lines, we were unable to obtain si3- or si5-expressing cell lines. This may suggest that centaurin-α1 plays an important role in cell survival or proliferation.Thereafter, we constructed the T-REx 293 cell lines in which the expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of si3, si4, or si5 is induced by doxycycline. In T-REx 293 cells, the tetracycline repressor is constitutively expressed, and therefore shRNA is not expressed in the absence of doxycycline. To know the suppressive effect of siRNA on the expression of endogenous centaurin-α1 mRNA, we examined the expression level of centaurin-α1 mRNA in these cell lines after doxycycline treatment. As shown in Fig. 5A, si3 and si5 significantly attenuated the expression level of endogenous centaurin-α1 mRNA. On the other hand, si4 had only a small effect on the mRNA level (Fig. 5A). Next, we examined the contribution of centaurin-α1 in EGF signaling. The inducible siRNA-expressing cells were transfected with pFR-Luc, pFA2-Elk-1, and phRL-tk 24 h after doxycycline treatment. One day after the transfection, the cells were stimulated with EGF for 3 h, and luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 5B). The cells expressing shRNA si3 or si5 (but not those expressing si4) showed markedly decreased luciferase activity compared with the cells without induction of siRNA. This result indicates that centaurin-α1 is required for the EGF-dependent activation of Elk-1 in T-REx 293 cells. To examine whether centaurin-α1 is necessary for ERK activation by EGF, the phosphorylation state of ERK was analyzed after EGF stimulation with or without the pretreatment of cells with doxycycline. As shown in Fig. 5C, phosphorylation of ERK by EGF stimulation was decreased when the expression of centaurin-α1 was reduced by siRNA si3 or si5. In contrast, we could not detect the decrease of phosphorylated ERK in cells in which si4 was expressed (Fig. 5C). This result indicates that centaurin-α1 contributes to the phosphorylation of ERK in the EGF signaling pathway.FIGURE 5Down-regulation of the endogenous centaurin-α1 by siRNA suppresses the activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway by EGF. A, T-REx 293 cells were stably transfected with each of the inducible shRNA (si3, si4, or si5) expression vectors. Each cell line was treated with or without doxycycline (Dox, 500 ng/ml). Two days after doxycycline treatment, total RNA was extracted and the amounts of centaurin-α1 mRNA were measured by the real-time PCR method. The values were normalized to β-actin mRNA. Values are means ± S.E. from six experiments (*, p < 0.001). B, each cell line was pretreated with or without doxycycline (500 ng/ml) for 24 h and co-transfected with pFR-Luc, phRL-tk, and pFA2-Elk-1. 24 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with EGF (0.1 ng/ml) for 3 h. Thereafter, the cells were lysed and luciferase activities were analyzed. Renilla luciferase levels were used as an internal control. Shown is the mean ± S.E. from five experiments. C, each cell line was pretreated with or without doxycycline (500 ng/ml) for 48 h and stimulated with EGF (1 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were lysed, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphorylated ERK and anti-ERK antibodies. The graphs show the ratio of the density of phosphorylated ERK to that of total ERK. Values are means ± S.E. from five experiments (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIt is well known that, after growth factor stimulation, both the PI3K pathway and the ERK MAP kinase pathway are activated (19Langford D. Hurford R. Hashimoto M. Digicaylioglu M. Masliah E. BMC Neurosci. 2005; : 6PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wennstorm S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although these two pathways are activated independently, cross-talk between the PI3K and ERK pathways has been reported (21Campbell M. Allen W.E. Sawyer C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Trimble E.R. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the signaling molecules linking the PI3K pathway to the ERK MAP kinase cascade have been unclear. In this report, we have shown that centaurin-α1 may act as an adaptor molecule that links the PI3K activation to the ERK MAP kinase cascade. Our results reported here suggest that, upon growth factor stimulation, PIP3, which is produced by activated PI3K, promotes the recruitment of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane via the PH domains of centaurin-α1, and thereafter centaurin-α1 activates Ras, resulting in the activation of the ERK MAP kinase cascade (see Fig. 6). Molecular mechanisms by which centaurin-α1 activates Ras remain elucidated.FIGURE 6Centaurin-α1 is involved in ERK activation by EGF stimulation. The EGF signal is transduced via two pathways; one involves centaurin-α1. Centaurin-α1 is recruited to the plasma membrane in response to PI3K activation by EGF and activates Ras resulting in ERK activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When centaurin-α1 is overexpressed in COS-7 cells, a small part of wild-type centaurin-α1 localized to the plasma membrane without EGF stimulation. This may be due to the unnaturally excess amount of centaurin-α1 protein in the cells. Given that the RC1RC2 mutant form of centaurin-α1 hardly localized to the plasma membrane and that LY294002 treatment decreased the localization of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane, the basal activity of PI3K and the steady-state level of PIP3 abundance may contribute to this localization.In RNAi experiments, we used the HEK293 cell line to evaluate the role of centaurin-α1 in EGF signaling, as we found that both centaurin-α1 and the EGF receptor are endogenously expressed in this cell line (data not shown). The large scale functional genomics approaches identified centaurin-α1 as a putative AP-1 regulatory oncogene and suggested that centaurin-α1 could function to augment cell proliferation in a primary cell type and mediate cellular transformation (22Chanda S.K.

It is generally thought that the polymerization of amyloid peptides is a stepwise process, with early events leading to formation of small oligomers, followed by assembly into soluble protofibrils first and insoluble fibrils later (10Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3770) Google Scholar). This process has been examined in detail for amyloid β (Aβ) of Alzheimer's disease using a variety of methods to unravel the different steps of fibril formation and growth. A “dock-and-lock” model has been proposed for fibrillogenesis (11Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Jennings J.M. Vinters H.V. Ghilardi J.R. Lee J.P. Mantyh P.W. Maggio J.E.

This model has been confirmed by studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors (13Hashimoto S.E. Nagata K. Handa H. Real-time Analysis of Biomolecular Interactions: Applications of BIACORE. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo2000: 23-30Crossref Google Scholar) that served to follow in real time the binding reactions between Aβ fibrils, immobilized on a sensor chip, and Aβ monomers continuously flowing onto the chip at a constant concentration (14Myszka D.G.

This technology enables us to study association and dissociation rates on a very short time scale (seconds), thus approaching the single events underlying fibril elongation. Understanding the early phases of Aβ misfolding and aggregation is particularly important for the development of prevention strategies, because oligomers rather than mature amyloid fibrils may feature in nerve cell dysfunction and degeneration in animal models of disease. Similarly, critical oligomeric states have been described in the pathway of PrP fibril formation (17Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol.

Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 292-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), including species with β-turn-rich conformation and neurotoxic properties (19Kazlauskaite J. Young A. Gardner C.E. Macpherson J.V. Venien-Bryan C. Pinheiro T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 292-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, information is limited on the binding events underlying PrP oligomerization, particularly at the first stages of fibrillization. We therefore used SPR to obtain kinetic data regarding these early binding events, after short term flow of low order oligomers onto soluble, prefibrillar PrP82–146 aggregates immobilized on the SPR sensor chips. Our data indicate that the PrP82–146 polymerization reaction is well explained by the dock-and-lock model, the “locking” step actually being due two sequential isomerization steps, each increasing the affinity of the monomer for the fibril until a condition of irreversible assembly is reached. These studies highlight important similarities and differences between Aβ and PrP82–146. Peptides—PrP82–146 and PrP82–146 with a totally scrambled sequence (PrP82–146scr) were synthesized and purified as previously described (9Salmona M. Morbin M. Massignan T. Colombo L. Mazzoleni G.

Peptide Immobilization on Sensor Surface—The peptide solutions used for immobilization on the BIACORE sensor chip were prepared to facilitate the formation of high order aggregates. Thus, 200 μm PrP82–146 were incubated for 18–24 h at room temperature in 2× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4; Invitrogen). In these conditions PrP82–146 readily formed visible aggregates. Just before the immobilization procedure, the solutions were rapidly centrifuged (800 rpm for 30 s); the supernatants (containing “prefibrillar aggregates”; see “Results”) were diluted four times with deionized water and used for the immobilization procedure. The peptides were covalently linked to the sensor chips with carboxymethylated dextran surface (CM4 and CM5; Biacore Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) using amine-coupling chemistry (21Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). After surface activation, the peptide solutions were injected for 2–10 min (flow rate, 5 μl/min), and the remaining activated groups of the dextran surface were blocked with a 15-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0 (21Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). A reference cell was always prepared in parallel by the same immobilization procedure (activation/deactivation steps) without the addition of peptides. In some experiments the scrambled PrP82–146 peptide (9Salmona M. Morbin M. Massignan T. Colombo L. Mazzoleni G. Capobianco R. Diomede L. Thaler F. Mollica L. Musco G. Kourie J.J. Bugiani O. Sharma D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48146-48153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was immobilized using the same procedure described for wild-type PrP82–146. As a further control in one experiment, we immobilized Aβ42 using a peptide solution containing prefibrillar aggregates morphologically similar to those used for PrP82–146 immobilization. To this aim, a 220 μm Aβ42 solution was incubated for 1 h in 2× PBS, diluted four times with deionized water, and centrifuged for 30 s at 800 rpm. The supernatant was diluted five times with acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and used for the immobilization procedure. SPR Analysis of PrP82–146 Extension and Dissociation—The flowing PrP82–146 solutions were prepared to minimize aggregation reactions and favor the presence of low order oligomers. The peptide was dissolved in ice-cold, sterile deionized water at a final concentration of 1–2 mm, kept on ice, and used within 8 h. Just before injection, the peptide solution was diluted to 3–40 μm using BIACORE running buffer (HBS, 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.0 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). In one experiment only (see Fig. 6) we injected the PrP82–146 solution containing higher order assemblies, prepared by diluting the supernatant used for the immobilization procedure (see above) 10-fold with HBS. PrP 82–146 solutions were injected at a rate of 3–30 μl/min for 2–8 min, as indicated. At the end of the injection, the sensor surface was washed, and the dissociation phase data were collected for 15–60 min. The assays were done at 25 °C. The solutions were run simultaneously over two to four flow cells. The sensorgram (time course of the SPR signal, expressed in resonance units (RU)) observed in the cell immobilizing the peptide was corrected by subtracting the response observed in the empty cell (reference cell) and usually normalized to a baseline of 0 RU. The dissociation curves are classically analyzed using exponential equations with the simplest situation, i.e. from a simple bimolecular or Langmuir interaction, modeled by a single exponential decay. Here, double and triple exponential equations were also used to fit the data to see whether more complicated models were significantly better than the simpler ones, by the F-test (extra sum-of-squares test; GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Finally, kinetic rate constants were obtained by the global fitting of both association and dissociation phases according to the three-step model (16Cannon M.J. Williams A.D. Wetzel R. Myszka D.G. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 328: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) described by the following equations,d[B]t/dt=-k1[A]t[B]t+k-1[AB]td[AB]t/dt=k1[A]t[B]t-(k-1+k2)[AB]t+k-2[A*B]td[A*B]t/dt=k2[AB]t-(k-2+k3)[A*B]t+k-3[A**B]td[A**B]t/dt=k3[A*B]t-k-3[A**B]t where k1, k2, k3, k–1, k–2, and k–3 are the values of the rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions, [A]t is the concentration of injected PrP82–146 peptide, [B]t is the amount (RU) of unbound immobilized PrP82–146 fibrils, [AB]t is the amount of bound peptide (RU), [A*B]t and [A**B]t represent subsequent conformational changes (see “Results”), and the dependence on time is explicitly indicated. Less complex models were also considered, by setting k3 = 0 (two-step model) or k2 = 0 (simple bimolecular interaction). With any given set of values of the rate constants, and of [A]t, the equations were solved numerically using a Runge-Kutta second order approximation in a spreadsheet of Microsoft Excel, and the simulated response (SR) of the SPR measurement was calculated (SRt = C([AB]t + [A*B]t + [A**B]t), where C is a suitable instrumental constant). SRt was compared with the measured response (Rt), and the values of the rate constants were optimized minimizing the sum of square errors (Σ(SRt – Rt)2). For this purpose, we used the Solver function associated to each spreadsheet of Microsoft Excel, which performs a constrained nonlinear fitting based on the generalized reduced gradient algorithm. Nature of the Oligomers in the Peptide Solutions Used for SPR Studies—The ultrastructure of soluble peptide aggregates used for immobilization on sensor surface for SPR analysis was determined by electron microscopic analysis. Five μl of PrP82–146 solutions were applied to 200-mesh Formvar carbon-coated nickel grids for 6 min, gently removed using Whatman No. 1 paper, air-dried, and negative stained with uranyl acetate for 5 min. The samples were observed with an electron microscope (EM109; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) operated at 80 kV at a standard magnification, calibrated with an appropriate grid. The mean diameter of peptide aggregates in the supernatant was measured on computer captured images using a computer-assisted image analyzer (Nikon Eclipse E-800) (9Salmona M. Morbin M. Massignan T.

The presence, amount, size, and morphology of materials detected by electron microscopy were semiquantitively evaluated by three independent operators. To verify the nature of the species formed by PrP82–146 in flowing solution, we performed an immunogold labeling using the monoclonal antibody 3F4 that recognized an epitope corresponding to residues 108–111 of human and hamster PrP proteins (22Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five μl of PrP82–146 flowing solutions were applied to 200-mesh Formvar carbon-coated nickel grids for 6 min, gently removed, and fixed with 5 μl of PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde. Five min later the fixing buffer was replaced with 5 μl of incubation buffer (PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin) containing 5% horse serum and further incubated for 20 min. The grids were then incubated for 2 h with 3F4 antibody (Dakocytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:40 in incubation buffer. After washing in PBS, the grids were incubated in 1:30 12-nm colloidal gold-AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory) for 2 h. After washing in water, the materials were negatively stained with uranyl acetate for 5 min. Quasi-elastic laser light scattering measurements were taken on a standard apparatus equipped with a BI9K Digital correlator (Brookhaven Instruments Co., Holtsville, NY). The light source was an Argon ion laser operating on the 514-nm green line (Lexel, Fremont, CA). From the scattered intensity correlation function, the hydrodynamic radii of the aggregates in solution were determined by cumulant and multiexponential analysis (23Cantù L. Corti M. Del Favero E. Raudino A. J. Phys. II France. 1994; 4: 1585-1604Crossref Google Scholar). Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (24Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) was used to irreversibly cross-link aggregated peptides, as done in previous studies on Aβ40 (25Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 26Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins was carried out as previously described (24Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 18 μl of peptide solution were added to 1 μl of 1 mm tris-(2,2′-bipyridyl)-ruthenim (II) and 1 μl of 20 mm ammonium persulfate in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and the mixture was irradiated using a 150-watt short arc Xenon lamp positioned 15 cm from the reaction tube. Unless otherwise stated, the irradiation time was 10 s, and the reaction was quenched immediately thereafter with 10 μl of Tricine sample buffer containing 1.5% dithiothreitol. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 1.5-mm-thick, 10–17.5% Tris-Tricine gradient gels. Non-cross-linked peptide was used as a control for each cross-linked peptide. The peptide bands were visualized by silver staining. Nature of the PrP82–146 Species in the Solutions Used for SPR Studies—Electron microscopy analysis of the PrP82–146 flowing solution detected globular particles with a diameter of 31 ± 11 nm (mean ± S.D.; range, 8–56 nm; Fig. 1a). These poorly defined sphere-shaped species were identified as PrP82–146 by immunogold labeling (Fig. 1b). No fibrillar or protofibrillar structures could be detected. The ultrastructural examination of the solution used for PrP82–146 immobilization on the sensor chip disclosed that most of the materials aggregated in a loose meshwork of little chains formed by small round-shaped particles having a diameter of 19 ± 7 nm (range 8–52 nm; Fig. 1c). Moreover electron microscopy analysis disclosed the presence of a few straight, short filaments with a diameter of ∼5.5 nm, whereas no fibrils were detected. Small round shaped material, often organized to form little chains, was present in the solution of Aβ42 immobilized on sensor chip as an internal control (Fig. 1d). For Aβ42, however, the globular units appeared smaller (8 ± 2 nm; range, 3–15 nm). When examined by quasi-elastic laser light scattering, the PrP82–146 “flowing solution” contained species with an average hydrodynamic radius (RH, by cumulant analysis) of 250 nm. Multiexponential analysis of the correlation function decay (Fig. 2A) showed that most of these species (>99% by number) had average RH = 12 nm, corresponding to small oligomers. Much larger species (average RH = 1700 nm) were found in the PrP82–146 solution used for immobilization on the sensor surfaces. SDS-PAGE on both the PrP82–146 solutions, without any irradiation, showed monomers to trimers (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). Dimers and trimers are therefore very stable, being resistant to a procedure involving boiling in SDS. For comparison, in the same experimental conditions Aβ40 was detected as monomers only, as previously described (25Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 26Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). PrP82–146 monomers-to-trimers are presumably in dynamic equilibrium, as indicated by preliminary data showing that isolation of the monomers promptly results in the formation of dimers and trimers. When the PrP82–146 solutions were irradiated to covalently cross-link preaggregated peptides, higher order species became apparent (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Most of the PrP82–146 in the solution used for immobilization is assembled in species that remain at the top of the gel (“heavy forms”; Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). Only low order species (1–5-mers) were detected after irradiation of the PrP82–146 freshly diluted in HBS (i.e. the solution injected over the immobilized peptide in SPR studies). On the basis of these findings, we will refer to “prefibrillar aggregates” for the PrP82–146 species prevalent in the solution used for immobilization and “small oligomers” for the PrP82–146 species prevalent in the injected (flowing) solution. SPR Experiments—We immobilized different amounts of PrP82–146 (from 400 to 2000 RU), corresponding to ∼50–250 fmol of peptide/mm2 of sensor chip (13Hashimoto S.E. Nagata K. Handa H. Real-time Analysis of Biomolecular Interactions: Applications of BIACORE. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo2000: 23-30Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 3 (A–C) shows representative sensorgrams obtained by injecting different concentrations of PrP82–146 (as small oligomers) on the sensor surface coated with prefibrillar aggregates of PrP82–146 (Fc2) and on the empty sensor surface (reference cell, Fc1). Binding to this empty cell is much lower than to the PrP82–146-coated cell and tends to zero after 15–20 min of dissociation. This indicates that the injected peptide does not bind to the chip matrix and that the binding measured in Fc2 is due to binding to immobilized PrP82–146 (i.e. no new seeds are generated). Much lower binding levels were also found when PrP82–146 was injected on flow cells in which PrP82–146scr or Aβ42 prefibrillar aggregates had been immobilized (Fig. 4); furthermore PrP82–146 binding to PrP82–146scr and Aβ42 dissociated rapidly and completely, whereas most of its binding to PrP82–146 did not dissociate (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting pseudo-irreversible elongation/aggregation (see below).FIGURE 4Sensorgrams obtained by injecting 30 μm PrP82–146 (small oligomers) on three different flow cells on which ∼600 RU of PrP82–146 prefibrillar aggregates, PrP82–146scr, or Aβ42 prefibrillar aggregates had been immobilized. These sensorgrams were obtained in the same experimental session, i.e. after injection of the same PrP82–146 solution (2 min; flow rate, 30 μl/min) onto the same chip. These results were replicated three times. The plots were created by adjusting the response (RU) to 0 just before the injection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Time course of PrP82–146 dissociation. Representative BIACORE sensorgram obtained by injecting 20 μm PrP82–146 (small oligomers) on the flow cell coated with PrP82–146 prefibrillar aggregates (∼2000 RU). PrP82–146 dissolved in HBS was injected for 2 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, and the dissociation phase was followed for 60 min. The sensorgram is corrected for the signal measured in the empty cell to show the “specific” binding (see Fig. 3). The response was adjusted to 0 just before the injection. The inset highlights the dissociation phase and also shows the fitting of the experimental points by a triple exponential function, which was significantly better than the double and single exponential fittings (sum-of-squares, 2.8, 11, and 98, respectively, using the three equations). The goodness of the fitting by the triple exponential equation is also highlighted by the small residuals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our experimental plan consisted of consecutive cycles of peptide injections, without regeneration steps, which could disrupt the growing prefibrillar aggregates. The binding, however, was not affected by the cumulative growth of the aggregates cycle by cycle, as indicated by the good reproducibility between the responses obtained when repeating peptide injections over the same flow cell (see for example the replicates in Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, the cumulative amount of peptide remaining pseudo-irreversibly bound after consecutive cycles of injections could greatly exceed (up to 30 times) the amount of peptide that had been initially immobilized on the chip, strongly suggesting an aggregation/elongation process. The association phase of specific binding (i.e. corrected for the signal measured in the empty cell; Fig. 3D) was essentially linear, although in some cases we noted some slight curvature. Under our experimental conditions (up to 8 min of injection), however, the reaction never reached equilibrium. The association rates, calculated between 30 and 90 s, were linearly correlated with the concentration of injected peptide (Fig. 3). Similarly, the association rates measured on injecting 10 μm PrP82–146 were also linearly correlated with the fibril surface concentration (not shown). PrP82–146 dissociation (see a representative sensorgram in Fig. 5) appeared to be multiphasic because the single exponential fitting was significantly worse than the double exponential fitting, which was significantly worse than the triple exponential fitting. According to the triple exponential fitting shown in the inset of Fig. 5, 9 ± 5% (n = 8) of the bound PrP82–146 dissociates with a very short half-life (0.05 ± 0.02 min), 9 ± 5% dissociates with"
https://openalex.org/W2094033944,"AP2α and p53 form nuclear complexes that establish a functional partnership, which regulates the expression of certain genes involved in cell growth and metastasis. The growth effects of AP2α are mediated through p21WAF1/CIP1 and the ability for AP2α to coactivate p21 requires p53. Herein, we have localized the AP2-binding region of p53 to amino acids 305–375. Analysis of 26 distinct p53 alleles established a correlation between AP2α binding and transcriptional coactivation. The L350P point mutation was the only nonbinding allele that retained normal transcriptional activity by reporter assay. Although both wild-type and L350P alleles facilitated binding of AP2α to the p21 promoter, the L350P allele was significantly reduced in its ability to induce the endogenous p21 gene, demonstrating a striking difference in activity comparing reporter assays with activation of endogenous p53 target genes. Interestingly, expression of AP2 in the absence of radiation repressed p53-mediated induction of p21 and this effect was explained by a reduction in p53 stability induced by AP2α overexpression. We conclude that AP2α has competing effects on p53 activity through coactivation and decreased stability. These findings may provide a mechanism to account for the discrepancies reported for the association between AP2 and p21 expression in tumor tissue."

The present study was conducted to determine the pilin structures necessary for glycosylation.

Pilin from strain PA103 was not glycosylated by P. aeruginosa 1244, even when the C-terminal residue was converted to Ser. Substituting the disulfide loop region of strain PA103 pilin with that of strain 1244 allowed glycosylation to take place.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that expresses polar filaments called type IV pili. These pili are polymers of a primarily proteinaceous subunit referred to as pilin. Although all known type IV pilins are modified by the cleavage of a leader sequence followed by the N-methylation of the exposed Phe (1Mattick J.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), the pilin of P. aeruginosa 1244 is additionally glycosylated. This glycosylation requires the presence of PilO, an enzyme whose coding sequence is in the same operon as pilA, the pilin structural gene (2Castric P.

Oligosaccharide assembly can take place either by sequential sugar addition to the target protein or by synthesis prior to glycosylation in which the entire pre-formed glycan is transferred as a single unit (7Szymanski C.

Carbohydrates in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, alike, are usually bound to the peptide chain via the amide nitrogen of an Asn residue (N-linked) or via the functional hydroxyl group of Ser or Thr (O-linked).

An intriguing aspect of P. aeruginosa 1244 pilin glycosylation is that the trisaccharide used to modify pilin is structurally identical to the O-antigen repeating unit (17DiGiandomenico A.

Expression of gene clusters coding for heterologous O-antigens in strain 1244 resulted in the production of pilin glycosylated with the heterologous saccharide, confirming that the source of the pilin glycan is part of the O-antigen biosynthetic pathway. PilO is not essential for O-antigen or pilin biosynthesis and is the only glycosylation-specific protein requirement in P. aeruginosa 1244 pilin glycosylation (17DiGiandomenico A. Matewish M.J.

A consensus peptide sequence of Ser/Thr-Xaa-Asn, in which Xaa can be any residue except Pro, acts as the environment for N-linked glycosylation as observed in N-glycosylated proteins of C. jejuni, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Clostridium thermocellum (6Benz I.

A consensus sequence for O-glycosylation, other than the requisite of a Ser/Thr residue, has not been identified, indicating distinct substrate specificity for individual transferases that mediate O-linked glycosylation. Gaining an understanding of the pilin structures necessary for pilin glycosylation by P. aeruginosa 1244 would provide insight into an important biological process in which little is understood and may usher in the comprehension of O-linked glycosylation specificities of other systems. The present study is the most comprehensive investigation of prokaryotic glycosylation substrate specificity to date. These results suggest that the C-terminal Ser of P. aeruginosa 1244 pilin is the major glycosylation recognition structure and that this residue cannot be substituted at its carboxyl group. Although no other specific recognition features are present, the pilin surface must be compatible with the reaction machinery for glycosylation to occur. Further, we present evidence that suggests that pilin folding and disulfide bond formation occurs prior to glycosylation. These findings could have future applications in vaccine engineering. Culture Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Intermediate plasmids utilized for mutant construction can be found in supplemental Table S1. For general culturing, bacteria were grown aerobically at 37 °C on LB agar plates or in LB broth, shaken at 250 rpm. The cultures were grown on casamino acids yeast extract medium (2% agar, 0.75% casamino acids, 0.15% yeast extract (19Silipigni-Fusco, J.

The concentrations of antibiotics used in selective media were as follows: ampicillin at 50 μg/ml for Escherichia coli; carbenicillin at 250 μg/ml for P. aeruginosa; kanamycin at 35 μg/ml for E. coli and 100 μg/ml for P. aeruginosa; and tetracycline at 100 μg/ml for P. aeruginosa. IPTG was added to media to a final concentration of 5 mm to induce expression of genes under the control of the tac promoter.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains/plasmidsDescriptionSource or referenceStrainsP. aeruginosa1244Wild type, IATS O7Ref. 391244N3rpoN (TcR)Ref. 271244.47pilAO (HgR)This study1244.2024pilAOBCD (KmR)This studyPA103Wild type, IATS O11Ref. 40E. coliXL1-BluerecA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lacStratageneXL10-GoldendA1 supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA96 relA1 lacHteStratageneDH5αsupE44 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1InvitrogenHB101supE44 hsdS20 recA13 ara-14 proA2 lacY1 galK2 rpsL20 xyl-5 mtl-1Ref. 41PlasmidspUCP264.9 kb pUC18-derived broad host-range cloning vector, TcRRef. 42pUCP26pilOpUCP26 with 1244 pilOThis studypMMB66EH8.8-kb broad host range expression vector, ApR/CbRRef. 43pPAC46pMMB66EH with 1244 pilAORef. 2pPAC202::Tn501-13A cosmid subclone containing a transposon insertion in 1244 pilARef. 21p1244 S148TpPAC46 with coding sequence for Ser148 of pilA mutated to ThrThis studyp1244 A149pPAC46 with the addition of an Ala and a stop codon after Ser148 of pilAThis studypSD5pMMB66EH with PA103 pilAThis studyp103 P144SpSD5 with the Pro144 codon of pilA mutated to SerThis studyp103 PKSpSD5 with codons for Asn142, Glu143, and Pro144 of pilA mutated to Pro, Lys, and Ser, respectivelyThis studypHYBRIDpMMB66EH with the chimeric pilA coding for the first 123 residues of PA103 pilin, a Gly at residue 124, and the last 31 residues are those of 1244 pilin; this plasmid also contains pilOThis studypHYB-OpMMB66EH with the chimeric pilA from pHYBRID; this plasmid does not contain pilOThis studyp1244 C127ApPAC46 with coding sequence for Cys127 of pilA mutated to AlaThis studyp1244 C145ApPAC46 with coding sequence for Cys145 of pilA mutated to AlaThis studyp1244Δ135-139pPAC46 with coding sequence for residues 135-139 of pilA (AWKPN) deletedThis studyp1244Δ135-144pPAC46 with coding sequence for residues 135-144 of pilA (AWKPNYAPAN) deletedThis studyp1244Δ128-144pPAC46 with coding sequence for residues 128-144 of 1244 pilA (KITKTPTAWKPNYAPAN) deletedThis studyp103 INS136pSD5 with coding sequence for residues 135-139 of 1244 pilA (AWKPN) inserted at amino acid positions 136-141 of PA103 pilA with Pro144 (now Pro149) mutated to SerThis studyp1244 S147pPAC46 with mutant pilA that had coding sequence for Lys 147 mutated to Ser and Ser 148 mutated to a stop codonThis studyp1244 S149pPAC46 with 1244 pilA that had the Ser148 codon mutated to Ala and the addition of Ser 149 followed by a stop codonThis studyp1244 S150pPAC46 with mutant pilA that had coding sequence for Ser148 mutated to Ala, an Ala at position 149, a Ser at position 150 followed by a stop codonThis studyp103 S146pSD5 with coding sequence for two Ala inserted into PA103 pilA at positions 144 and 145 terminating in Ser146This study Open table in a new tab Homology Modeling—Homology modeling was performed by submission of mature pilin sequences to the online 3D-PSSM program (20Kelley L. MacCallum R. Sternberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). DS Viewer Pro 6.0 was used to visualize tertiary structures and to generate molecular surfaces and Gasteiger charges. Fig. 1 shows the primary (21Castric P.A. Sidberry H.F. Sadoff J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and predicted tertiary structure of 1244 pilin derived from homology modeling. Generation of P. aeruginosa 1244 pilA Mutants—The deletion mutant 1244.2024 was constructed by first digesting pPAC202 (21Castric P.A. Sidberry H.F. Sadoff J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which contained a 7.8-kb insert harboring the pilAO operon, with PstI. This removed a 3.8-kb fragment containing the operon and left flanking insert pieces of 1.9 and 2.1 kb attached to the vector. The fragment containing the vector was ligated with a KmR cartridge, generated by digesting pUC-4K (Amersham Biosciences) with PstI, producing pPAC2024K. The cloned region of this plasmid was removed by digestion with EcoRI and ligated with pBR322 digested with the same enzyme producing pPAC3/6. This construct was introduced into P. aeruginosa 1244 by triparental mating (22Ruvkun G. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 1981; 289: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) using tetracycline resistance as a selective marker. Tested clones were found to also be KmR, indicating that incorporation of the plasmid by recombination had occurred. Colony lifts probed with a strain 1244 pilin-specific monoclonal antibody produced pilin-negative clones that were TcS, CbS, and KmR, indicating the loss of vector and the functional pilA gene. The loss of pilin production was confirmed by Western blot, whereas the loss of pilA was confirmed by Southern blot using pPAC2024K insert DNA as a probe. The initial step for construction of the insertion mutant, strain 1244.47, involved ligation of pBR322 digested with BamHI and NheI with the 12-kb fragment produced by the digestion of pPAC202::Tn501-13, a previously described construct (21Castric P.A. Sidberry H.F. Sadoff J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with BamHI and XbaI. The plasmid produced by this ligation reaction was confirmed by restriction site analysis and introduced into P. aeruginosa 1244 by triparental mating (22Ruvkun G. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 1981; 289: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) using mercury resistance as a selective marker. Tested clones were found to also be CbR, indicating that incorporation of the plasmid by recombination had occurred. Approximately 2 × 105 colony-forming units of one of these clones were incubated with 2 × 106 plaque-forming units of pilus-specific bacteriophage PE69 in 200 μl of LB broth for 20 min at room temperature. Aliquots of this material were plated on LB-Hg medium where clones produced were found to be HgR and CbS, indicating the loss of vector. Disruption of the pilA gene of one of these clones, referred to as strain 1244.47, was confirmed by Southern blot using strain 1244 pilA DNA as a probe. Loss of gene function was confirmed by Western blotting of 1244.47 cell extracts using a pilin-specific monoclonal antibody as a probe. Plasmid Construction—To analyze pilin specificity for glycosylation, cloned pilA was subjected either to site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit) or to deletion/insertion mutagenesis (ExSite mutagenesis kit), or a hybrid pilA was constructed consisting of portions of strain PA103 and 1244 pilin coding sequence (Table 1 and Fig. 2). For a detailed description of the construction of plasmids, see the supplemental material. Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting using cell extracts was performed as previously described (21Castric P.A. Sidberry H.F. Sadoff J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Extracts of 1244N3/pPAC46 and 1244N3/pPAC24 (2Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were used as the source of 1244 glycosylated pilin standards and 1244 nonglycosylated pilin standards, respectively. When mutant pilin was not easily detectable from cell extracts in Western blot analyses, the membrane fraction was extracted as a means to concentrate pilin for analysis. Here, the membrane fraction was harvested from 200-ml LB overnight broth cultures. The A650 of the culture was recorded followed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in a GSA rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm K2HPO4, 30 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA). This material was sonicated (three 15-s bursts, on ice) and centrifuged at 6,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and debris. The supernatant fluid was subjected to ultracentrifugation (SW60Ti rotor) at 30,000 rpm for 1 h, after which the membrane material was located in the pellet. The membrane fraction was resuspended in 400 μl of deionized H2O. The initial A650 values taken for cell culture density were used to normalize samples for SDS-PAGE. The cell extracts and membrane fraction samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 16% T, Tris-glycine or 16% T, Tricine gels (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). Tricine-PAGE was used when PA103 pilin was being analyzed as this pilin resolved into sharper bands under these conditions. Separated molecules were electroblotted to nitrocellulose paper and blocked as previously described (21Castric P.A. Sidberry H.F. Sadoff J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Either anti-1244 pilin mouse monoclonal antibody, 5.44 (24Sidberry H. Kaufman B. Wright D. Sadoff J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 76: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); anti-PA103 pilin mouse monoclonal antibody, 2.97 (25Saiman L. Sadoff J. Pyle M. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2764-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); or anti-pilin polyclonal serum was used as the primary probe to detect the proteinaceous portion of pilin. To determine whether or not the pilin was glycosylated, anti-1244 pilin glycan monoclonal antibody, 11.14 (18Castric P. Cassels F.J. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26479-26485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), or anti-1244 pilin glycan polyclonal serum was used as the primary probe. To obtain the anti-1244 pilin glycan polyclonal antibodies, rabbit serum from an animal that was immunized with pure P. aeruginosa 1244 glycosylated pili was adsorbed with pure 1244 pili containing a heterologous glycan. This yielded a glycan-specific serum devoid of a pilin protein response. The monoclonal antibodies were used as a probe when epitope disruption did not result from mutagenesis of pilin genes (16Castric P.A. Deal C.D. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 371-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Saiman L. Sadoff J. Pyle M. Prince A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2764-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, polyclonal serum was employed. A fluorescein isothiocyanate- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (26Chia J.S. Chang L.Y. Shun C.T. Chang Y.Y. Chen J.Y. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6987-6998Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was used, and fluorescence was detected using a FluorImager595 (Molecular Dynamics) employing the 530 DF30 filter. Structural Requirements of the Pilin Glycosylation Residue—We have previously provided evidence that the C-terminal residue, Ser148 (Fig. 2), is the glycosylation site of P. aeruginosa 1244 pilin (14Comer J.E. Marshall M.A. Blanch V.J. Deal C.D. Castric P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2837-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether a Thr could be tolerated at this position, the Ser148 codon of pPAC46 was changed to a Thr codon, yielding p1244 S148T (Fig. 2). When extracts of strain 1244N3, a pilAO negative mutant (27Ramphal R. Koo L. Ishimoto K.S. Totten P.A. Lara J.C. Lory S. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expressing this construct were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 3), it was seen that pilin containing Thr in the 148 position was capable of being glycosylated. This was determined by position of pilin migration (Fig. 3A) and by reaction with a glycan-specific antibody (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that recognition of the hydroxyl group at the glycosylation site was not hindered by the presence of the Thr methyl group. Because the strain 1244 pilin glycosylation site is at the C terminus, this amino acid, in addition to lacking a C-linked residue, contains a carboxyl group. To see whether this arrangement was necessary for glycosylation, p1244 A149, a construct in which an Ala codon was inserted after Ser148, was generated and expressed in 1244N3. Western blot analysis of cell extracts of 1244N3/p1244 A149 revealed that pilin produced was nonglycosylated as determined by apparent molecular weight (Fig. 3A) and by lack of reaction with a glycan-specific antibody (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that pilin glycosylation by strain 1244 requires that the residue being modified be at the C terminus. Such a situation would explain why none of the other Ser or Thr residues of this protein, even though likely at the protein surface, were glycosylated. Minimal Pilin Structures Necessary for Glycosylation—To determine structures important in glycosylation of strain 1244 pilin, we replaced residues of PA103 pilin (Fig. 2), a normally nonglycosylated pilin (44Smedley III, J.G. Jewell E. Roguskie J. Horzempa J. Syboldt A. Stolz D.B. Castric P. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7922-7931Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), with those of 1244 pilin and assayed for glycosylation. When plasmid pSD5, which contained the pilA gene from PA103 behind a tac promoter, was expressed in strain 1244, PA103 pilin produced had the same apparent molecular weight as that of wild type (Fig. 4A) as determined by Western blot using a PA103 pilin-specific monoclonal antibody as a probe. This is not surprising because strain 1244 pilin glycosylation requires a C-terminal Ser (14Comer J.E. Marshall M.A. Blanch V.J. Deal C.D. Castric P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2837-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas PA103 pilin terminates in a Pro (Fig. 2). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the C-terminal pilin residue encoded in pSD5 to Ser, thereby producing p103 P144S (Fig. 2). When this plasmid was expressed in P. aeruginosa 1244 and pilin was assayed by Western blot for modification by PilO, it was revealed that the PA103 pilin produced showed no difference in apparent molecular weight when compared with wild type PA103 pilin, indicating the absence of glycosylation (Fig. 4A). The pilin glycosylation ability of the host strain was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-1244 pilin monoclonal antibody, which revealed the presence of glycosylated strain 1244 pilin (data not shown). These results indicate that other structures besides the C-terminal Ser/Thr are important for pilin glycosylation. Both 1244 and PA103 pilins contain a “tail” region that consists of three residues beyond the C-proximal DSL Cys (Fig. 4B). p103 PKS (Fig. 2) was generated to determine whether either of the remaining residues in the tail served as a recognition site for pilin glycosylation. When this plasmid was expressed in strain 1244 and extracts of these cells were subjected to Western blot analysis, it could be seen that the only PA103 pilin produced was nonglycosylated (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that structures other than the 1244 pilin tail region are needed for glycosylation. To determine the role of the DSL in glycosylation, the loop structure of strain PA103 pilin was substituted with the analogous region of strain 1244. The plasmid constructed to test this, pHYBRID, codes for a hybrid protein consisting of the first 123 residues of PA103 pilin, the C-terminal 31 residues of 1244 pilin (which includes the entire 1244 DSL), and PilO, all behind a tac promoter (Fig. 2). This construct was expressed in 1244.47, a pilAO negative mutant, where membrane fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 5). The blot, when probed with a pilin-specific antibody, revealed the presence of a band with an apparent molecular weight similar to that of glycosylated pilin (Fig. 5A). When pilO was absent, this band was replaced with one corresponding with nonglycosylated pilin (Fig. 5A). In addition, in the presence of PilO, the pilin produced reacted with an antibody specific for the pilin glycan, whereas there was no reaction to the hybrid pilin expressed in the absence of PilO (Fig. 5B), indicating that the higher apparent molecular weight of the hybrid pilin was a result of the presence of the glycan (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the presence of the 1244 pilin DSL was able to facilitate the glycosylation of PA103 pilin. Mutational Analysis of the P. aeruginosa 1244 Pilin DSL—The finding that replacement of the DSL of PA103 pilin with that from strain 1244 supported glycosylation, whereas the PA103 pilin (even with the replacement of the tail region) did not, suggests that either the DSL of 1244 pilin contains specific structures important in the glycosylation reaction or that components of the PA103 pilin loop somehow prevent glycosylation. To examine the role of strain 1244 pilin DSL structures, we first looked at the disulfide bond to see whether its formation was essential for glycosylation. Plasmids p1244 C127A and p1244 C145A (Fig. 2), constructs that encoded mutant pilins incapable of forming the disulfide bond of the DSL, were generated and expressed in strain 1244N3.

https://openalex.org/W2067999167,"Premeiotic S-phase and meiotic recombination are known to be strictly coupled in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the checkpoint pathway regulating this coupling has been largely unknown. In fission yeast, Rad3 is known to play an essential role in coordination of DNA replication and cell division during both mitotic growth and meiosis. Here we have examined whether the Rad3 pathway also regulates the coupling of DNA synthesis and recombination. Inhibition of premeiotic S-phase with hydroxyurea completely abrogates the progression of meiosis, including the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSB formation is restored in rad3 mutant even in the presence of hydroxyurea, although repair of DSBs does not take place or is significantly delayed, indicating that the subsequent recombination steps may be still inhibited. Examination of the roles of downstream checkpoint kinases reveals that Cds1, but not Chk1 or Mek1, is required for suppression of DSB in the presence of hydroxyurea. Transcriptional induction of some rec+ genes essential for DSB occurs at a normal timing and to a normal level in the absence of DNA synthesis in both the wild-type and cds1Δ cells. On the other hand, the transcriptional induction of the mei4+ transcription factor and cdc25+ phosphatase, which is significantly suppressed by hydroxyurea in the wild-type cells, occurs almost to a normal level in cds1Δ cells even in the presence of hydroxyurea. These results show that the Rad3-Cds1 checkpoint pathway coordinates initiation of meiotic recombination and meiotic cell divisions with premeiotic DNA synthesis. Because mei4+ is known to be required for DSB formation and cdc25+ is required for activation of meiotic cell divisions, we propose an intriguing possibility that the Rad3-Cds1 meiotic checkpoint pathway may target transcription of these factors.

On the other hand, the transcriptional induction of the mei4+ transcription factor and cdc25+ phosphatase, which is significantly suppressed by hydroxyurea in the wild-type cells, occurs almost to a normal level in cds1Δ cells even in the presence of hydroxyurea. These results show that the Rad3-Cds1 checkpoint pathway coordinates initiation of meiotic recombination and meiotic cell divisions with premeiotic DNA synthesis. Because mei4+ is known to be required for DSB formation and cdc25+ is required for activation of meiotic cell divisions, we propose an intriguing possibility that the Rad3-Cds1 meiotic checkpoint pathway may target transcription of these factors. Checkpoints play a central role in coordinated progression of the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 1Murakami H. Nurse P. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Among them, monitoring of DNA replication is crucial for stable maintenance of the genome. Unscheduled arrest of DNA replication forks or incomplete replication of the genome elicits checkpoint signals that arrest the ongoing S-phase or inhibit mitosis. These signals involve ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) (Rad3 or Tel1 in fission yeast)-related kinases and their downstream Chk1 or Chk2 (Chk1 or Cds1 in fission yeast) kinases. It is known that inhibition of premeiotic DNA replication (meiS) by hydroxyurea (HU) 2The abbreviations used are: HUhydroxyureaDSBdouble-strand breakMMminimal mediumFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterMbmegabase. leads to inhibition of meiosis I and II in a manner dependent on Rad3 and Cds1 (1Murakami H.

Thus, checkpoint signaling similar to the one operating during mitosis regulates the coordination of DNA replication and cell division during meiosis. hydroxyurea double-strand break minimal medium fluorescence-activated cell sorter megabase. High frequency recombination is an event specific to meiosis, and in budding yeast it is strictly coupled to ongoing DNA synthesis (3Borde V. Goldman A.S. Lichten M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4085-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It was reported that, in fission yeast, defect in meiotic recombination delays meiosis I and II in a manner dependent on Mek1 (6Shimada M. Nabeshima K. Tougan T. Nojima H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Pérez-Hidalgo L. Moreno S. San-Segundo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 116: 259-271Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a meiosis-specific Cds1-related kinase. It has not been known whether premeiotic DNA replication and meiotic recombination are regulated under checkpoint regulation. Initiation of meiotic recombination is marked by the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) on the genome (8Cervantes M.D. Farah J.A. Smith G.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Very recently, while we were preparing this report, it was reported that meiotic DSB formation in fission yeast is coupled to premeiotic DNA replication in a manner dependent on DNA replication checkpoint proteins (9Tonami Y. Murakami H. Shirahige K. Nakanishi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 2005; 19: 5797-5801Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the Rad3-Cds1 pathway, but not Chk1 or Mek1 pathway, inhibits the generation of meiotic DSB when premeiotic DNA replication is inhibited by HU in fission yeast. We have also presented data suggesting that Rad3-Cds1 may target the transcription of the mei4+ transcription factor, which is required for DSB formation, for suppression of initiation of meiotic recombination in response to inhibition of DNA replication. We will discuss a possible novel mechanism of the Rad3-Cds1 meiotic checkpoint regulation. Yeast Strains, Media—Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains used in this study were JZ767 (h+ pat1–114 leu1 ade6-M210), KO192 (h+ pat1–114 chk1::ura4+ leu1–32 ade6 ura4-D18), KO194 (h+ pat1–114 cds1::ura4+ leu1–32 ura4-D18), KO273 (h+ pat1–114 rec12::ura4+ cds1::ura4+ leu1–32 ura4-D18), KO298 (h– pat1–114 mek1::kanMX6 leu1–32 ade6-M210), and KO350 (h+ pat1–114 rad3::ura4+ leu1–32 ura4-D18). Cells were grown in minimal medium (MM) containing the required supplements (20 g/liter of glucose, 3 g/liter of potassium biphthalate, 2.2 g/liter of Na2HPO4, and 5 g/liter of NH4Cl). MM lacking NH4Cl was used for nitrogen starvation experiments. General genetic methods were previously described (10Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar, 11Isshiki T. Mochizuki N. Maeda T. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Induction of Meiosis in pat1–114 Cells—Cells, grown at 25 °C to 5 × 106 cells/ml in MM supplemented with 100 μg/ml of leucine and 100 μg/ml of adenine, were washed with MM lacking NH4Cl four times and were resuspended in MM lacking NH4Cl supplemented with 25 μg/ml of leucine, followed by incubation for 16 h at 25 °C. After addition of an equal volume of prewarmed MM containing 1 g/liter of NH4Cl supplemented with 50 μg/ml of leucine, 70 μg/ml of adenine, and with or without 24 mm HU, meiosis was induced by shifting the temperature to 32 °C. Equal volumes of samples were withdrawn at each time point from each culture for FACS and DNA analyses on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Flow Cytometry—5 × 106–1 × 107 cells were spun down, washed once with water, and then fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were treated with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml), stained with propidium iodide (2 μg/ml) as described previously (10Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar), and processed for flow cytometry using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Northern Analyses of Transcription in Fission Yeast Cells—Total RNA was prepared from synchronized pat1–114 or pat1–114 cds1Δ cells as described previously (12Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). Ten μg of each total RNA was used for analysis. For probes, portions of open reading frames were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR for rec6+, rec7+, rec12+, mei4+, spo6+, mde2+, mde3+, and cam1+ (loading control). For the cdc25+ probe, the 0.9-kb BamHI-BglII fragment was used as described previously (13Iino Y. Hiramine Y. Yamamoto M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of Meiotic DSBs by Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis—pat1–114 cells released from nitrogen starvation were harvested every hour and treated as described previously (14Murakami H. Nurse P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was carried out in a 0.6% chromosomal grade agarose gel (Bio-Rad) on Bio-Rad CHEF-DRIII apparatus, recirculated at 14 °C. Electrophoresis was for 48–72 h at 1.5 V/cm in 0.5× Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer with a switch time of 30 min at an included angle of 106°. For analyses by Southern hybridization, electrophoresis was conducted in a 0.8% chromosomal grade agarose gel (Bio-Rad) for 24 h at 6 V/cm in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, with linearly ramped 60–120-s switch time at an included angle of 120° as described previously (8Cervantes M.D. Farah J.A. Smith G.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Suppression of DSB Formation in the Presence of HU Is Abrogated in rad3Δ Mutant—Meiotic recombination is initiated by the extensive induction of DSBs on chromosomal DNAs. DSBs can be detected by analyzing the chromosomal DNA on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (8Cervantes M.D. Farah J.A. Smith G.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To analyze the meiotic DSB, we have utilized pat1 temperature-sensitive cells in which meiotic processes can be induced synchronously by shifting up the temperature. pat1+ encodes a protein kinase that phosphorylates Mei2 protein and negatively regulates meiosis both at the stage of premeiotic DNA replication and at that of meiosis I. In pat1–114 cells, meiosis can be induced in a haploid state at a nonpermissive temperature in a synchronous manner (13Iino Y. Hiramine Y. Yamamoto M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 198: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 198: 497-502Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Cell. 1994; 78: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). During the pat1-induced meiosis, premeiotic DNA replication (meiS) initiates at 1–2 h after the shift and completes by 3 h (Fig. 1A). DSBs are detected at 3 h after the shift and disappear by 4–5 h (Fig. 1B). When HU is added at time 0, meiS is completely blocked and cells stay as one nuclear state. Under this condition, generation of DSBs is also completely suppressed. We have constructed rad3Δ,pat1–114 strain and examined meiS and DSB. In the absence of HU, meiS and DSB occurred with identical or slightly accelerated timing. In the presence of HU, meiS is completely suppressed as in the rad3+ cells but the DSBs are generated, albeit with significantly delayed timing (Fig. 1, A and B). The maximum level of DSBs is detected at 6 h after the shift. This indicates that suppression of meiotic DSB in the presence of HU requires Rad3 function. Persistent presence of DSBs in rad3Δ cells suggests that the subsequent repair of DSBs by recombination functions is still suppressed or extremely delayed even in the absence of the Rad3 function (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Cds1 Checkpoint Kinase Is Required for Suppression of DSBs in the Presence of HU—Cds1 and Chk1 are known to function downstream of Rad3 in DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoint signaling in fission yeast (1Murakami H. Nurse P. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). During meiosis, Mek1, a Cds1-related meiosis-specific kinase, was shown to be required for coupling of recombination and meiosis (6Shimada M. Nabeshima K. Tougan T. Nojima H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Pérez-Hidalgo L. Moreno S. San-Segundo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 116: 259-271Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have introduced each of these checkpoint kinase mutants into pat1–114 cells and examined meiS and DSB formation. In the absence of HU, all these mutants enter meiS with normal or slightly accelerated timing, completing it by 3 h. DSBs are also generated at a normal level, peaking at 3–4 h (Fig. 2A). In the presence of HU, meiS is suppressed in all the mutants. DSBs are suppressed in chk1Δ and mek1Δ cells as in the wild-type cells but are clearly induced in cds1Δ cells at a timing similar to that observed in rad3Δ cells (Figs. 1A and 2A; see also supplemental Fig. S1). To prove that the fragmented DNAs observed are indeed the product of meiotic DSB but are not due to the non-specifically broken and non-repaired chromosomes, we have examined DSB in cds1Δ, rec12Δ mutant cells. Meiotic DSBs depend on the Rec12 protein, and in its absence meiotic DSBs are not generated (8Cervantes M.D. Farah J.A. Smith G.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The DSBs generated in the cds1Δ background in the presence of HU are not detected in the rec12Δ background (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the observed chromosome fragmentation is indeed the product of authentic meiotic recombination. DSBs in cds1Δ cells in the presence of HU are detected at 3 h after the shift, and their intensities rather increase at later hours as was observed in rad3Δ cells, indicating that the repair of DSBs does not occur or is extremely delayed under this condition (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). DSBs Near the ura1+ Locus Occur at Similar Locations in the cds1Δ Cells in the Presence of HU—Next we examined the meiotic DNA breakage of chromosome I. The DSBs were detected by Southern hybridization using a specific probe DNA containing the ura1 gene, which permitted the identification of specific DNA fragments generated by meiotic DSB (8Cervantes M.D. Farah J.A. Smith G.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the wild-type cells, the specific DNA bands are detected at 3–4 h after the shift, consistent with the results of the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (Figs. 1B and 3A). In the presence of HU, these bands are not detected. In cds1Δ cells, the DNA bands with a very similar pattern are detected even in the presence of HU. They appear at 3 h after the shift and are detectable even at 7 h (Fig. 3, B and C). The intensities of these bands are greatly reduced in cds1Δ,rec12Δ cells (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that they are the products of meiotic DSBs. Similarly, the DSBs in the presence of HU were restored in rad3Δ cells as well (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that DSB in cds1Δ and rad3Δ cells in the presence of HU occurs at the positions common to those of normal meiosis and firmly establish that the Rad3-Cds1 pathway is required for suppression of meiotic DSB in the presence of HU. We also examined whether cds1Δ can suppress loss of meiotic nuclear divisions during pat1-induced meiosis in the presence of HU. Whereas nearly 80% of the wild-type cells contained only one nucleus in the presence of HU after incubation for 8 h, the cells with two or more nuclei increased up to 60 or 80% in rad3Δ or cds1Δ cells, respectively. This increase of multinuclear cells was not observed in chk1Δ or mek1Δ cells (supplemental Fig. S2), indicative of partial recovery of nuclear divisions in the cells compromised for the Rad3-Cds1 pathway. This is consistent with the previous observation made in diploid cells (2Murakami H. Nurse P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Induction of rec+ Gene Transcription Is Not Affected by HU Treatment—Initiation of meiotic recombination depends on a number of proteins including various rec+ gene products and replication factors (14Murakami H. Nurse P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Davis L. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8395-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These genes are transcriptionally induced during the meiotic process prior to induction of DSB (19Lin Y. Smith G.R. Genetics. 1994; 136: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have examined transcriptional induction of various rec+ genes in the presence of HU in both wild-type and cds1Δ cells in order to test the possibility that presence of HU affects the transcriptional induction of these genes and that Cds1 may target them for suppression of DSB in the absence of DNA synthesis (Fig. 4). The transcription of rec6+, rec7+, and rec12+, which is required for meiotic DNA breakage, is induced at 2 h after the shift and peaks at 3 h in the wild-type cells. It is induced at similar or slightly earlier timing in cds1Δ cells. The transcripts disappear by 5 h after the shift (Fig. 4A). In the presence of HU, the induction of rec+ genes occurs with similar timing and to a similar level, but their transcripts are maintained at a significant level until 8 h after the shift (Fig. 4B). This may indicate that shut off of the rec+ gene transcripts requires completion of DNA replication, recombination, or meiosis. In cds1Δ cells in the presence of HU, induction occurred at timing similar to that of the wild-type cells, and the transcripts returned to the basal level in a time course similar to that of the wild-type in the absence of HU. This may suggest that Cds1 may inhibit the shut off of the induced rec+ genes in the presence of HU. These results show that the absence of DNA synthesis does not affect the induction timing and the level of rec+ genes, strongly suggesting that expression of at least some rec+ genes is not the target of HU-mediated inhibition of meiotic recombination. HU-induced Inhibition of Transcription of mei4+ and cdc25+ Is Abrogated in cds1 Mutant—mei4+ is a meiosis-specific transcription factor required for induction of genes involved in sporulation during the later stages of meiosis (13Iino Y. Hiramine Y. Yamamoto M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Horie S. Watanabe Y. Tanaka K. Nishiwaki S. Fujioka H. Abe H. Yamamoto M. Shimoda C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2118-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Abe H. Shimoda C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently reported that mei4+ is required for DSB formation (22Young J.A. Hyppa R.W. Smith G.R. Genetics. 2004; 167: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Iino et al. (13Iino Y. Hiramine Y. Yamamoto M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that transcriptional induction of mei4+ is impaired by HU treatment, suggesting that mei4+ transcription depends on DNA replication. Consistent with this report, the mei4+ transcript, which is sharply induced at 3–5 h after the shift, is very poorly induced in the presence of HU in the wild-type cells (Fig. 4B). In cds1Δ mutant cells, the mei4+ transcript is induced with the timing almost identical to the wild-type cells. In the presence of HU, the induction is delayed by 1 h, but the transcript reaches to a level comparable with that in the absence of HU. Similarly, the transcription of spo6+, mde2+, and mde3+, known targets of Mei4 protein (20Horie S. Watanabe Y. Tanaka K. Nishiwaki S. Fujioka H. Abe H. Yamamoto M. Shimoda C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2118-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Abe H. Shimoda C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is induced in cds1Δ cells (albeit with a 1-h delay) but not in the wild-type cells in the presence of HU (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that Cds1 inhibits the mei4+ transcription in response to HU treatment during meiosis in fission yeast. Inhibition of DNA replication by HU causes persistent inhibitory phosphorylation of tyrosine 15 of Cdc2 kinase, and this may be at least partially responsible for inhibition of meiosis I and II by HU (2Murakami H. Nurse P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The tyrosine 15 phosphorylation is a target of Rad3-Cds1 checkpoint regulation during meiosis, because it is dephosphorylated in rad3Δ and cds1Δ cells treated with HU. However, it is not known how Rad3-Cds1 suppresses the tyrosine 15 dephosphorylation in response to inhibition of DNA replication during meiosis. Iino et al. (13Iino Y. Hiramine Y. Yamamoto M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the transcription of cdc25+, encoding the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of Cdc2 tyrosine 15, thus for activation of Cdc2 kinase, is suppressed by HU treatment during pat1-induced meiosis. Indeed, the cdc25+ transcription, which is normally induced at 4–5 h after Pat1 inactivation, is not induced in the presence of HU (Fig. 4). We therefore examined whether this inhibition is abrogated by the cds1 mutation. In cds1Δ cells, the cdc25+ transcription is induced in the presence of HU to a level comparable with that in the absence of HU. Thus, it is an intriguing possibility that the Rad3-Cds1 checkpoint pathway may target the transcription of mei4+ and cdc25+ for suppression, which may concomitantly inhibit meiotic DSB formation and meiotic cell division, respectively, in response to inhibition of DNA replication. Meiotic recombination is initiated by DSBs generated by Rec12 protein (8Cervantes M.D. Farah J.A. Smith G.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and is followed by repair of the generated ends through homologous recombination. It is known to be strictly coupled to premeiotic DNA synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Borde V. Goldman A.S. Lichten M. Science. 2000; 290: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 4Smith K.N. Penkner A. Ohta K. Klein F. Nicolas A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 88-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Murakami H. Borde V. Shibata T. Lichten M. Ohta K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4085-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that the Rad3-Cds1 checkpoint pathway regulates the coordination of meiS with the initiation of meiotic recombination, namely introduction of DSBs. It was previously reported that Rad3 regulates coupling of meiS with meiotic cell division (1Murakami H. Nurse P. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 2Murakami H. Nurse P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inhibition of meiS by HU inhibits meiosis I and II, and this inhibition is partially circumvented by rad3Δ or cds1Δ through decreased phosphorylation of tyrosine 15 of Cdc2 (2Murakami H. Nurse P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Another checkpoint involving Mek1 kinase, related to Cds1 (6Shimada M. Nabeshima K. Tougan T. Nojima H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2807-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Pérez-Hidalgo L. Moreno S. San-Segundo P.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 116: 259-271Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), operates to coordinate recombination and cell division. Our data indicate that the Rad3-Cds1pathway is also involved in suppression of formation of DSBs in the absence of premeiotic DNA replication. It is interesting to note that the following repair of the generated DNA ends does not take place or is at least extremely delayed in HU-treated rad3Δ or cds1Δ cells (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that this step may be regulated by an as yet unknown checkpoint pathway. While we were preparing this report, Tonami et al. (9Tonami Y. Murakami H. Shirahige K. Nakanishi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 2005; 19: 5797-5801Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that suppression of meiotic DSB formation in the presence of HU during fission yeast meiosis is relieved in rad3Δ, cds1Δ, and rad26Δ cells as well as in checkpoint clamp-clamp loader mutant (rad1Δ, rad9Δ, hus1Δ, rad17Δ) cells. The next question concerns the nature of the critical target of Cds1 in suppression of DSB formation in HU-treated meiotic cells. We have examined transcriptional induction of various rec+ genes and other factors. Our data indicate that induction of at least some rec+ genes whose products are required for DSB formation (18Davis L. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8395-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Young J.A. Hyppa R.W. Smith G.R. Genetics. 2004; 167: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) is normal in both wild-type and cds1Δ cells treated with HU (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the level of induction of mei4+, encoding a meiosis-specific transcription factor required for expression of genes involved in later stage of meiosis (20Horie S. Watanabe Y. Tanaka K. Nishiwaki S. Fujioka H. Abe H. Yamamoto M. Shimoda C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2118-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Abe H. Shimoda C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is substantially reduced in wild-type cells treated with HU, as was reported previously (13Iino Y. Hiramine Y. Yamamoto M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the transcription of the target genes of Mei4 protein was also reduced. Interestingly, transcriptions of mei4+ and its target genes were restored to the control level in cds1Δ cells in the presence of HU. Furthermore, cdc25+ transcription, which is also inhibited by HU in the wild-type cells, is restored in cds1Δ cells in the presence of HU. Because mei4+ is required for DSB formation (22Young J.A. Hyppa R.W. Smith G.R. Genetics. 2004; 167: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Cdc25 is an activator of cell division, these results lead us to propose an intriguing model that transcription of mei4+ and cdc25+ may be a target of the Rad3-Cds1 checkpoint during meiosis and that suppression of these genes in the presence of HU would concomitantly inhibit both DSB formation and meiotic cell divisions as well as sporulation (Fig. 5). mde2+, a target of Mei4, was recently reported to be required for meiotic DSB formation (23Gregan J. Rabitsch P.K. Sakem B. Csutak O. Latypov V. Lehmann E. Kohli J. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1663-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The transcription of mde2+ is under the regulation of Cds1 (Fig. 4) and thus may be one of the critical targets of Mei4 during this meiotic checkpoint regulation (X in Fig. 5). It is known that chromatin remodeling is required for DSB formation at a recombination hot spot (24Steiner W.W. Schreckhise R.W. Smith G.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Mizuno K. Emura Y. Baur M. Kohli J. Ohta K. Shibata T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 876-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Yamada T. Mizuno K. Hirota K. Kon N. Wahls W.P. Hartsuiker E. Murofushi H. Shibata T. Ohta K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1792-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We observed significant reduction of chromatin remodeling at ade6-M26 after HU treatment. 3K. Hirota and K. Ohta, unpublished data. Thus, Cds1 protein activated by HU may inhibit the reorganization of the chromatin favorable for DSB formation and expression of the putative target genes of Rad3-Cds1 checkpoint. In cds1Δ cells, chromatin structures may be maintained in a state permissive for DSB and for gene expression even in the presence of HU. Cds1 may inhibit the expression of mei4+ and cdc25+ independently. Alternatively, down-regulation of cdc25+ expression may be due to decreased expression of mei4+, because the level of cdc25+ transcript significantly decreases during meiosis in mei4Δ cells (13Iino Y. Hiramine Y. Yamamoto M. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present, however, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that loss of expression of these genes by HU treatment may somehow result from the absence of meiotic recombination and that Rad3-Cds1 may inhibit DSB formation through some other target(s). We are currently conducting experiments to test the model. We thank Dr. Seiji Matsumoto and other members of the laboratory for useful advice on experiments and helpful discussion.

https://openalex.org/W1971472175,"BPV-4 E5 inhibits transcription of the bovine MHC class I heavy chain (HC) gene, increases degradation of HC and downregulates surface expression of MHC class I by retaining the complex in the Golgi apparatus (GA). Here we report that transcription inhibition can be alleviated by interferon treatment and the degradation of HC can be reversed by treatment with inhibitors of proteasomes and lysosomes. However, the inhibition of transport of MHC class I to the cell surface is irreversible. We show that E5 is capable of physically interacting with HC. Together with the inhibition of the vacuolar ATPase (due to the interaction between E5 and 16k subunit c), the interaction between E5 and HC is likely to be responsible for retention of MHC class I in the GA. C-terminus deletion mutants of E5 are incapable of either downregulating surface MHC class I or interacting with HC, establishing that the C-terminus domain of E5 is important in the inhibition of MHC class I."
https://openalex.org/W2034805397,"Pro- and antiapoptotic proteins of the large Bcl-2 family are critical regulators of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Whereas antiapoptotic proteins of the family share all four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1–BH4), proapoptotic members may lack some of these domains, but all so far described proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins enclose BH3. The bcl-x gene gives rise to several alternative splice products resulting in proteins with distinct functions as the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and proapoptotic Bcl-xS. Here, we describe a novel Bcl-x splice product of 138 amino acids termed Bcl-xAK (Atypical Killer), which encloses the Bcl-2 homology domains BH2 and BH4 as well as the transmembrane domain, but lacks BH1 and BH3. Weak endogenous expression of Bcl-xAK was seen in melanoma and other tumor cells. Interestingly, its overexpression by applying a tetracycline-inducible expression system resulted in significant induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells, which occurred in synergism with drug-induced apoptosis. After exogenous overexpression, Bcl-xAK was localized both in mitochondrial and in cytosolic cell fractions. By these findings, a completely new class of Bcl-2-related proteins is introduced, which promotes apoptosis independently from the BH3 domain and implies additional, new mechanisms for apoptosis regulation in melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082096520,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) guards against chromosomal mis-segregation and the emergence of aneuploidy. SAC in higher eukaryotes includes at least 10 proteins including MAD1-3, BUB1-3, and Msp1. A long-standing observation has been that rodent cells are more tolerant of microtubule toxins than primate cells indicating that SAC function is more relaxed in the former than the latter. Here, we report on an unexpected functional difference between the rodent and human MAD1 component of the respective SAC. Ectopic expression of human MAD1 in mouse and hamster cells corrected a relaxed SAC to a more stringent form. Our findings posit MAD1 as a species-specific determinant which influences the stringency of cellular response to microtubule depolymerization and spindle damage."
https://openalex.org/W2129105465,"The prohormone convertases play important roles in the maturation of neuropeptides and peptide hormone precursors. Prohormone convertase-2 (PC2) is the only convertase that requires the expression of another neuroendocrine protein, 7B2, for expression of enzyme activity. In this study, we determined that 7B2 can be phosphorylated in Rin cells (a rat insulinoma cell line) and cultured chromaffin cells, but not in AtT-20 cells (derived from mouse anterior pituitary). Phosphoamino acid analysis of Rin cell 7B2 indicated the presence of phosphorylated serine and threonine. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>115</sup> (located within the minimally active 36-residue peptide) was confirmed by mutagenesis, although Ser<sup>115</sup> did not represent the sole residue phosphorylated. Two independent assays were used to investigate the effect of phosphorylated 7B2 on PC2 activation: the ability of 7B2 to bind to pro-PC2 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, and activation of pro-PC2 was assessed in a cell-free assay. Phosphorylated 7B2 was unable to bind pro-PC2, and the phosphorylated 7B2 peptide (residues 86–121, known to be the minimally active peptide for pro-PC2 activation) was impaired in its ability to facilitate the generation of PC2 activity in membrane fractions containing pro-PC2. <i>In vitro</i> phosphorylation experiments using Golgi membrane fractions showed that 7B2 could be phosphorylated by endogenous Golgi kinases. Golgi kinase activity was strongly inhibited by the broad-range kinase inhibitor staurosporine and partially inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, but not by the other protein kinase A, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, myosin light chain kinase, and protein kinase G inhibitors tested. We conclude that phosphorylation of 7B2 functionally inactivates this protein and suggest that this may be analogous to the phosphorylating inactivation of BiP, which impairs its ability to bind substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2001638504,"The oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) is part of receptor complexes for oncostatin M and interleukin-31. Signaling events are triggered by Jaks (Janus kinases) that constitutively bind to membrane-proximal receptor regions. Besides their established role in signaling, Jaks are involved in the regulation of the surface expression of several cytokine receptors. Here, we analyzed the structural requirements within the human OSMR that underlie its limited surface expression in the absence of associated Jaks. We identified three dileucine-like motifs within the Jak-binding region of the OSMR that control receptor surface and overall expression. A receptor mutant in which all three motifs were mutated to alanine displayed markedly increased surface expression. Although the surface half-life of this mutant was increased compared with that of the wild-type receptor, no difference in the internalization rate was detectable, implying that these receptors differ in their post-endocytic fate. The protein stability of the wild-type receptor was markedly lower than that of mutant receptors, but could be strongly increased in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. Our data are consistent with the dileucine motifs being involved in destabilization of receptors devoid of associated Jaks as part of a quality control ensuring signaling competence of OSMRs.

Like other cytokine receptors, the signal-transducing receptor chains of IL-6-type cytokines do not contain intrinsic kinase activity, but constitutively associate with members of the Jak (Janus kinase) family.

The membrane-proximal regions of gp130, the LIFR, and the OSMR contain the well conserved box1 region and a less well characterized box2 region, which have been implicated in Jak binding (15.Murakami M.

Hermanns H.M. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, associated Jak kinases become activated and mediate phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic region of the receptor chains. These phosphorylated tyrosines may then serve as docking sites for SH2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing proteins. In case of the OSMR, phosphorylation-dependent binding of latent STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and the adaptor protein SHC has been demonstrated (19.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S.

Cell. 1998; 93: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), we previously demonstrated that the binding of Jak1 to the OSMR is also needed for its efficient localization at the cell surface (20.Radtke S.

Using chimeric receptors, we showed that Jak1 coexpression leads to an increased number of fully processed receptors. This effect of Jak1 is not dependent on its kinase activity, but requires an intact FERM domain, indicating that interaction with the OSMR is necessary. We concluded that the OSMR might contain a negative regulatory signal within its membrane-proximal region that can be masked by an associated Jak. Indeed, deletion of the membrane-proximal region results in receptor constructs that are efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane. Interestingly, similar findings have been reported for other cytokine receptors. Thus, the Jak kinase Tyk2 supports the expression of IFNAR1 (interferon-alpha receptor-1) (23.Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G.

Even though not required for the surface expression of the common γ-chain, Jak3 expression positively influences its surface expression upon overexpression (28.Hofmann S.R. Lam A.Q. Frank S.

Although it has been demonstrated that Jaks may support receptor surface expression by altering the receptor internalization rate (IFNAR1) and receptor protein stability (e.g. thrombopoietin and growth hormone receptors), it is not clear yet how Jaks may affect these processes. The finding that deletion of membrane-proximal receptor regions positively affects the surface expression of the OSMR, EpoR, and IFNAR1 chain (20.Radtke S. Hermanns H.M. Haan C.

However, no such signal has been identified yet. We have characterized the mechanism underlying the regulation of OSMR surface expression by Jak1 in more detail. We demonstrate that the membrane-proximal region of the OSMR indeed contains a negative regulatory signal because transfer of this region to a well expressed receptor construct resulted in marked down-regulation. We have furthermore identified a stretch of 20 amino acids in the interbox1/2 region that regulates receptor surface and overall expression. Within these 20 amino acids, we identified three dileucine-like motifs implicated in the weak expression of the OSMR. Mutation of these motifs resulted in enhanced protein stability and an increased half-life at the cell surface. However, we detected no effect on receptor internalization. We propose that the three dileucine-like signals create a negative regulatory signal by conferring increased susceptibility to proteasomal and/or lysosomal degradation if not masked by associated Jak kinases.

For generation of stable HEK293 cells, the Flp-In™ system from Invitrogen was used, which allows insertion of the transfected plasmids into a single chromosomally integrated Flp recombinase target site, thus minimizing clone-to-clone differences between transfectants. The Flp-In™ T-REx™-293 cell line was purchased from Invitrogen. These cells contain a single integrated Flp recombinase target site and also stably express the Tet repressor.

The antisense oligonucleotides used incorporate an in-frame termination codon, followed by the recognition site for BamHI. Internal deletions and point mutations were introduced by fusion PCR using the respective oligonucleotides and the cDNA for IL-5Rβ-OSMR as a template. The same mutations were introduced into the wild-type OSMR by exchanging DNA fragments coding for the IL-5Rβ extracellular region with the respective fragments coding for the OSMR extracellular region.

PCR fragments were inserted into BspTI/BamHI-digested expression plasmid pSVL-IL-5Rβgp130BspTI. In the resulting constructs, Ile647 of gp130 was mutated to Leu due to the inserted BspTI site. The gp130-B1/2, gp130-IB2, and gp130-B1/2-3AA constructs were constructed from the respective β-chimeras by subcloning a EcoRI/BamHI fragment into pSVL-gp130.

The resulting vector (pFRiTte-spezial) was digested with XhoI/BamHI, and cDNA for OSMR-GFP and OSMR-3AA-GFP was inserted by standard cloning techniques. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequence analysis using an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies—The monoclonal anti-IL-5Rβ (S-16), polyclonal anti-IL-5Rβ (N-20), monoclonal anti-OSMR (AN-A2), and polyclonal anti-Jak1 (HR-785) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Rockland Inc., (Gilbertsville, PA). Monoclonal anti-gp130 antibody (BR3) was a kind gift of John Wijdenes (Diaclone, Besançon, France). Polyclonal antibody against cytoplasmic gp130 was purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Dako Corp. (Hamburg, Germany), and R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Fab fragments were from Dianova (Hamburg). Flow Cytometry—Cells (5 × 105 to 1 × 106) were resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide (PBS/azide) and incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-OSMR or anti-IL-5Rβ antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with cold PBS/azide and subsequently incubated in darkness with a 1:100 dilution of R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed again and resuspended in PBS/azide. Cells (104/sample) were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 488-nm argon laser. Mean fluorescence intensities of transfected cells were calculated using CellQuest software. For internalization assays, stable HEK293 cells expressing OSMR-GFP or OSMR-3AA-GFP were incubated for 30–60 min at 4 °C in binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3)) containing monoclonal anti-OSMR antibody. Cells were washed twice with binding medium and incubated for different time periods at 37 °C. Cells were then resuspended in PBS/azide, and surface expression was detected as described above. To measure protein stability, cells stably expressing GFP-tagged receptors were incubated for various periods of time with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) and harvested, and the GFP fluorescence was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. To block proteasomal and lysosomal degradation, cells were additionally incubated in MG132 (50 μm) or chloroquine (100 μm). To measure the surface half-life, cells were incubated with either brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) or monensin (50 μm) or treated with ethanol for up to 2 h. Cells were harvested and processed as described above for FACS analysis. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) Digestion, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton-X 100 or 1% Brij 97 (for co-immunoprecipitations)). Chimeric receptors were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates using monoclonal anti-IL-5Rβ antibody; for OSMR-GFP constructs, anti-OSMR antibody was used. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose and washed twice with wash buffer (lysis buffer with only 0.1% Brij 97). For Endo-H digestions, the immunoprecipitates were washed once with 200 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5) and incubated in citrate buffer for 18–24 h with or without 5 milliunits of Endo-H. Subsequently, the Sepharose was boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall Corp., Dreieich, Germany). Western blot analysis was conducted using the indicated antibodies and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before reprobing, blots were stripped in 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) for 20 min at 75 °C. The Membrane-proximal Region of the OSMR Contains a Transferable Signal That Negatively Regulates Receptor Surface and Overall Expression—We have proposed previously that the positive effect of Jak1 on the surface expression of the OSMR is due to the masking of a negative signal within the OSMR box1/2 region (20.Radtke S. Hermanns H.M. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Gascan H. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11297-11305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To identify the location of this signal, we used chimeric receptor constructs in which the IL-5Rβ extracellular region was fused to the transmembrane and intracellular regions of the OSMR. The expression of these chimeric receptors could be easily monitored by FACS and Western blot analysis. We compared the expression of the three deletion constructs depicted schematically in Fig. 1A: the construct βOR-B1/2 contained the intact membrane-proximal box1/2 region needed for Jak association; βOR-B1 was deleted after the box1 region; and βORΔcyt lacked all but three amino acids of the OSMR cytoplasmic region. In accordance with our previous results (20.Radtke S. Hermanns H.M. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Gascan H. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11297-11305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), FACS analysis showed that the construct containing the intact box1/2 region had significantly reduced surface expression compared with the constructs in which the box1/2 region was partially or fully deleted (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Moreover, the latter two constructs clearly appeared as two bands in Western blot analyses (Fig. 1A, lower panel). The top bands correspond to the fully processed Endo-H-resistant receptor forms, which are hardly visible for the βOR-B1/2 construct (see Fig. 2C) (16.Tanner J.W. Chen W. Young R.L. Longmore G.D.

Cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer, and receptors were immunoprecipitated (IP) using monoclonal anti-IL-5Rβ antibody. Samples were divided into two aliquots and incubated overnight with Endo-H or left untreated. Precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were stained with antiserum against IL-5Rβ. Endo-H-resistant receptor bands are indicated by the closed arrowhead. The open arrowheads indicate Endo-H-sensitive receptor forms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the box1/2 region of the OSMR is responsible for significantly reduced cell surface expression of the receptor, we investigated whether this motif, if transferred to a well expressed cytokine receptor, retains its negative regulatory activity. We chose the chimeric receptor βgp130Δcyt as the “recipient” receptor because we knew from our previous studies that this receptor is extremely well expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1B, upper panels, bar 1). Transfer of the whole box1/2 region of the OSMR to this receptor construct resulted in a strong decrease in cell surface expression (Fig. 1B, upper panels, bar 2). Interestingly, when analyzing whole cell lysates, we noted that this new chimeric receptor also displayed a drastically reduced overall expression rate (Fig. 1B, lower left panel). As seen before (Fig. 1A), we could exclude that the box1 region of the OSMR is involved in this negative effect because the same suppressive effect on cell surface as well as overall expression was obtained with a chimera in which only 43 amino acids of the OSMR had been fused to the gp130 part (β130-B1+IB2) (Fig. 1B, bar/lane 3). This chimeric construct retained the gp130 box1 region to which the interbox and box2 region of the OSMR were fused. Identical observations were made with a second chimeric system containing the full-length gp130 extracellular and transmembrane regions fused to the OSMR box1/2 region (Fig. 1B, right panel). We tested whether the expression of the chimeras could be ameliorated by Jak1 coexpr"

We showed that in healthy neurons maintained in HK medium, IκB-β is phosphorylated at a novel site, Tyr-161. LK-induced neuronal apoptosis is accompanied by a decrease in the extent of IκB-β phosphorylation at this residue. Tyr-161 shares similarity to the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Abl and Arg. Arg phosphorylates Tyr-161 differentially in vitro, and LK treatment does cause a down-regulation of Arg activity. Moreover, treatment of neurons with two structurally distinct and highly selective Abl inhibitors, PD173955 and Gleevec, blocks HK-induced phosphorylation of IκB-β at Tyr-161 and induces neuronal apoptosis. Overexpression of wild-type IκB-β blocks LK-induced apoptosis, but this effect is abolished when Arg is pharmacologically inhibited. On the other hand, forced overexpression of IκB-β in which Tyr-161 is mutated inhibits survival in HK demonstrating the importance of this residue to neuronal survival. Phosphorylation of IκB-β enhances its association with p65/RelA causing an increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity.

Apoptosis plays a critical role in the normal development of the nervous system by eliminating large numbers of superfluous neurons and ensuring proper neural connections. Aberrant apoptosis often occurs during adulthood leading to an unwanted loss of neurons such as that seen in neuropathological conditions, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, or Huntington disease and following ischemic stroke (reviewed in Ref. 1Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating apoptosis will therefore improve our understanding of neurodevelopment and will lead to the development of useful therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative conditions. One family of molecules that plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of neuronal survival in a variety of in vivo and in vitro experimental paradigms is NF-κB, a widely expressed transcription factor. Inhibition of NF-κB activity causes neuronal death in a variety of tissue culture paradigms of neurodegeneration (1Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 2Koulich E. Nguyen T. Johnson K. Giardina C. D'Mello S. J.

Reduced NF-κB activity has also been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (reviewed in Ref. 4Mattson M.P. Culmsee C. Yu Z. Camandola S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there are five NF-κB proteins, p50, p52, p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel, characterized by the presence of a conserved 300-amino acid Rel homology domain that is located toward the N terminus of the protein (reviewed in Refs. 5Bates P.W.

Functional NF-κBis composed of homodimers and heterodimers of these proteins, typically p65:p50, which are held in the cytoplasm by association with members of the IκB protein family. Generally, but not always, activation of NF-κB is mediated by the phosphorylation of IκB proteins on two N-terminal serine or threonine residues by the IκB kinase (IKK) 2The abbreviations used are: IKKIκB kinaseHKhigh potassiumLKlow potassiumDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideEMSAelectrophoresis mobility shift assayDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPGSTglutathione S-transferaseEMSAelectrophoresis mobility shift assayoligosoligonucleotidesPBphosphate buffer. 2The abbreviations used are: IKKIκB kinaseHKhigh potassiumLKlow potassiumDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideEMSAelectrophoresis mobility shift assayDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPGSTglutathione S-transferaseEMSAelectrophoresis mobility shift assayoligosoligonucleotidesPBphosphate buffer. complex, which contains the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ and the regulatory IKK/NEMO protein. Phosphorylation by the IKK complex targets IκB for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The released NF-κB thus translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to κB DNA motifs within the promoter regions of a variety of genes (6Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 7Lin A. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 72-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In addition to nuclear translocation, more recent evidence indicates that maximal transcription activity of NF-κB requires protein-protein interaction and site-specific post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation (6Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 7Lin A. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto Y.

Of the seven IκB family members, the best studied is IκB-α, which is phosphorylated by IKK at Ser-32 and Ser-36. Besides being a target of IKK, IκB-α can be phosphorylated at its C-terminal PEST domain by casein kinase-2 and DNA-PK (9Liu L. Kwak Y.T. Bex F. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Li X.H. Meek K. Lane W.S.

In contrast to IKK-mediated phosphorylation, however, IκB-α phosphorylation by these kinases does not cause its degradation (9Liu L. Kwak Y.T. Bex F. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Li X.H. Meek K. Lane W.S.

Another major member of the IκB family is IκB-β, which is phosphorylated by IKK at Ser-19 and Ser-23 (12DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison to IκB-α, relatively little is known about the functional significance of IκB-β. Although frequently assumed to be functionally interchangeable with IκB-α, more recent evidence indicates that IκB-β plays distinct roles within the cell (13Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol.

Although association with IκB-β can inhibit NF-κB, in some situations, IκB-β can lead to increased NF-κB activity, although the precise mechanisms involved remain to be fully addressed (15Newton T.R.

We have been studying the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal survival using primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons. These neurons undergo apoptosis when shifted from medium containing serum and depolarizing concentrations of potassium (high K+ medium, HK) to medium containing low potassium (LK) (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). NF-κBis required for the survival of granule neurons by HK (2Koulich E. Nguyen T. Johnson K. Giardina C. D'Mello S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, however, neither the levels nor intracellular distribution of the five NF-κB proteins nor those of IκB-α and IκB-β are altered in neurons primed to undergo apoptosis by LK treatment (2Koulich E. Nguyen T. Johnson K. Giardina C. D'Mello S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that one factor involved in the down-regulation of NF-κB activity by LK treatment is a lowering interaction between p65 and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP), an alteration that is associated with hyperphosphorylation (3Yalcin A. Koulich E. Mohamed S. Liu L. D'Mello S.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that cerebellar granule neuron survival by membrane-depolarizing stimuli such as HK involves phosphorylation of IκB-β. HK-induced phosphorylation of IκB-β occurs at a novel site, Tyr-161. We also report that phosphorylated IκB-β associates with NF-κB and stimulates its DNA binding activity. In neurons primed to die by LK treatment, there is a reduction in IκB-β phosphorylation and binding activity of NF-κB. We present evidence that HK-induced phosphorylation of IκB-β is likely mediated by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, Abl/Arg, molecules shown previously to regulate neuronal morphogenesis and axon guidance in the developing nervous system (18Finn A.J.

Overexpression of wild-type IκB-β prevents LK-induced apoptosis in neurons, whereas addition of PD173955, a highly selective Abl/Arg inhibitor, abolishes the neuroprotection effect by IκB-β. Moreover, when IκB-β (Y161F) mutant is overexpressed in neurons, neuronal survival in HK is reduced. Our results also show that mutation on Tyr-161 of IκB-β decreases the interaction between IκB-β and p65, which is similar to the effect of LK treatment and HK treatment with the presence of Abl inhibitor. Thus, our results identify IκB-β phosphorylation as a key event in neuronal survival and provide a mechanism by which this is mediated. Materials—Unless specified otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. PD173955 was a kind gift from Dr. Bayard Clarkson (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). CGP57148B (Gleevec) was obtained from Novartis Pharma AG (Switzerland). Both chemicals were dissolved in Me2SO. Antibodies for p65 (sc-372), IκB-β (sc-945), IκB-α (sc-371), GST (sc-138), c-Abl (sc-23), Arg (sc-20708), and c-Jun (sc-1694) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Specific peptides for IκB-β (sc-945P) and p35 (sc-820P) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology as well. Anti-α-tubulin (T-5168) was purchased from Sigma. Antibody for phosphotyrosine (9411) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The above antibodies were used in Western blotting experiments. Anti-IκB-β, c-Abl, and Arg antibodies were also used in immunoprecipitation experiments. Anti-IκB-β and p65 antibodies were used in supershift experiments as well. Cell Culture and Treatments—Granule neuron cultures were obtained from dissociated cerebella of 7–8-day-old rats as described previously (17D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in Basal Eagle's Medium with Earle's salts (BME) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml gentamycin on dishes coated with poly-l-lysine in 24-well dishes at a density 1.0 × 106 cells/well, 1.2 × 107 cells/60-mm dish, or 3.0 × 107 cells/100-mm dish. Cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 18–22 h after plating to prevent replication of non-neuronal cells. Unless indicated otherwise, cultures were maintained for 6–7 days prior to experimental treatments. For treatment, the cells were rinsed twice and then maintained in LK medium (serum-free BME medium, 5 mm KCl) or HK medium (serum-free BME medium, supplemented with 20 mm KCl). Unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends, treatment of cultures with pharmacological inhibitors was initiated 15 min prior to rinsing and was maintained through the subsequent incubation in LK or HK medium. The control cultures were treated with Me2SO. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—pGEX-KG constructs containing full-length wild-type and the S19A/S23A mutation of IκB-β were the generous gifts from Dr. Richard B. Gaynor (Eli Lilly Co.). The truncation mutants were generated by PCR and cloned into pGEX-KG vector. Site-specific mutations in IκB-β were generated with the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The full-length IκB-β containing wild-type or mutations on S19A/S23A and Y161F, respectively, were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) vector at the N terminus of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). All plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Expression of Bacterially Produced GST-IκB-β Proteins—The pGEX-KG-IκB-β constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) PlyS (Promega, Madison, WI). Cultures (250 ml) of E. coli were grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4 to 0.6 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h to induce the expression of the GST fusion protein. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)), mildly sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated with 0.5 ml of glutathione-agarose beads (G-4510, Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C. The matrix was washed four times with buffer A and resuspended in buffer A for GST pull-down assay. To obtain soluble fusion proteins, the beads were further washed two times with 5 ml each of buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). The fusion proteins were eluted off beads by 10 mm glutathione in buffer B at 37 °C for 30 min and stored at –80 °C. Neuronal Survival—Neuronal survival was assessed by staining neurons with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) to show the apoptotic characteristics of nuclei after treatment. Briefly, cells growing on coverslips were washed in 0.1 m PB, pH 7.4, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PB, pH 7.4, for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed once with PB for 5 min at room temperature followed by staining with DAPI solution (0.5 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. After staining, cells were washed again with PB for 5 min. Coverslips were then mounted on slides. Cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope, and the number was counted. Results from at least three separate experiments were statistically analyzed. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Extracts—To obtain cytoplasmic proteins, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and incubated on ice for 15 min. At the end of incubation, 1/20 volume of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. Cells were vortexed for 30 s and then subjected to centrifugation for 30 s at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants were collected as cytosolic proteins. Nuclei from neurons were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture and extracted on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Protein concentrations of the cellular proteins were determined by the Bradford assay using Bio-Rad reagent. Western Blots—50 μg of cellular extracts or protein complex pulled down by GST fusion protein or antibodies were resolved on SDS-poly-acrylamide gels. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked and incubated with the various antibodies mentioned previously. After washes, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Following the incubation, membranes were washed extensively and developed with ECL luminal reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The image was captured on x-ray film. Data were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—100–200 μg of cellular lysates from treated neurons was incubated with control and specific antibodies (1 to 2 μg) on ice for 30 min. Protein A/G-agarose beads were added to the mixture, and further incubation was carried out at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, beads were pelleted by centrifugation followed by three washes with buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture. The beads were then used in variety of experiments. Supernatants from the immunoprecipitation were collected and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western blotting of α-tubulin antibody. Analysis of Phosphorylation on Endogenous IκB-β—100-mm dishes of 7–8-day-old neurons were washed twice with warm, phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen) and incubated in phosphate-free DMEM containing 20 mm KCl overnight. The cultures were then incubated for 6 h in medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) with the indicated treatment. After being lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors mixture), the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described, and the proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Results were obtained by scanning on Storm860 (Amersham Biosciences). Data were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). GST Pull-down and in Vitro Kinase Assay—GST-IκB-β proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were incubated with whole cell lysates prepared from HK- and LK-treated neuronal cultures. The whole cell lysates were generated from cultures plated in 100-mm dishes (30 × 106 cells/dish) and lysed in a volume of 250 μl. The kinase assay was performed in the kinase reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 4 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 40 μm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture at 30 °C for 30 min. The beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation. After addition of 4× SDS sample buffer to the pellet, the samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Results were obtained by scanning with Storm860. Data were quantified using ImageQuant. Gel Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.1 pmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded κB-binding site oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′), SP1-binding site oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′), or TFIID-binding site oligonucleotide (5′-GCAGAGCATATAAGGTGAGGTAGGA-3′) in buffer containing 1 μg of poly[d(I·C)], 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 mm MgCl2, and 12% glycerol at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were analyzed by 5% native PAGE followed by autoradiography. For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with nonradiolabeled κB oligonucleotide (5′-TCGACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGCT-3′) or AP1 oligonucleotide (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) for 15 min on ice prior to the addition of 32P-labeled double-stranded κB-binding site oligonucleotide. For supershift experiments, specific antibody was incubated with nuclear extract for 15 min on ice followed by further incubation with 32P-labeled double-stranded κB-binding site oligonucleotide. Analysis of DNA Fragmentation—The neurons (60-mm plate) were treated with various reagents. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The DNA was precipitated from the supernatants by adding a 0.1 volume of 5.0 m NaCl and a 0.5 volume of isopropyl alcohol. After incubation at –20 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer containing proteinase K (300 μg/ml) and RNase A (100 μg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 50 °C. The samples were subsequently analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel in 1× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Transient Transfection—Transient transfection of granule neurons was carried out as outlined by Koulich et al. (2Koulich E. Nguyen T. Johnson K. Giardina C. D'Mello S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, on day 5 after plating, 10 μg/well of DNA was precipitated by calcium phosphate method at room temperature for 30 min and added dropwise to cultures that has been washed once with DMEM without l-glutamine, serum, and antibiotics (transfection DMEM). Cells were incubated in DMEM at 37 °C for 75–90 min followed by two washes with the medium. The transfection DMEM was then replaced with the original medium. The next day, cells were treated in HK or LK or with the addition of PD173955 (2 μm) for 24 h. Cells were then fixed, and DAPI staining was performed. Expression of EGFP and the DAPI-stained nucleus was visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Transfected cells were determined by merging images from GFP and UV filters. Phosphorylation of IκB-β but Not IκB-α Is Reduced during Neuronal Apoptosis—Cerebellar granule neurons undergo apoptosis when switched from HK medium to LK medium. Although cell death begins at about 16 h, previous studies have shown that commitment to death occurs within 6 h after the switch to LK medium (23Borodezt K. D'Mello S.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J.

As shown in Fig. 1A, IκB-β is phosphorylated in HK medium, and LK treatment leads to a reduction in the level of IκB-β phosphorylation. The reduction in IκB-β phosphorylation is detectable as early as 4 h after LK treatment, suggesting that it is causally involved in the induction of neuronal apoptosis (Fig. 1A). In contrast to IκB-β, the phosphorylation level of IκB-α is similar in HK or LK medium (Fig. 1B). The overall pattern of protein phosphorylation (Fig. 1C) and protein levels of both IκB-α and IκB-β are not altered by the treatment with HK and LK conditions (Fig. 1D), indicating that the reduced phosphorylation of IκB-β is specific. HK-induced IκB-β Phosphorylation Occurs at Site(s) Independent of IKK—It is known that IKK phosphorylates IκB-β at Ser-19 and Ser-23. We examined whether HK-induced IκB-β phosphorylation was mediated by IKK by using a mutant GST-IκB-β construct in which both Ser-19 and Ser-23 were mutated (GST-IκB-βS19A/S23A, see Fig. 2C). This construct can therefore not be phosphorylated by IKK. As shown in Fig. 2A, although the level of phosphorylation on GST-IκB-β in both HK and LK was somewhat reduced, the difference in phosphorylation between HK and LK extracts seen with wild-type GST-IκB-β was also observed in the double mutant. The same result was obtained using a C-terminally truncated form of GST-IκB-β, which lacks the two target sites of IKK (Fig. 2B). The similarity in the difference of phosphorylation elicited in HK and LK medium between wild-type IκB-β and IκB-βS19A/S23A or the C-terminally truncated mutant suggests that the differential phosphorylation on IκB-β during neuronal apoptosis happens on residue(s) that are not sensitive to IKK. Mapping Apoptosis-regulated Phosphorylation Site—To map the site within IκB-β that is differentially regulated during LK-induced apoptosis, several deletion constructs were generated and used in in vitro kinase assays with extracts from HK- and LK-treated neurons (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2B, GST-IκB-β fragments spanning residues 1–204S19A/S23A displayed differential phosphorylation similar to that seen with the full-length GST-IκB-β protein. In contrast, fragment spanning residues 195–359 were not differentially phosphorylated. Another fragment spanning residues 1–168S19A/S23A also displayed elevated phosphorylation level in HK compared with LK (data not shown). These results localize the HK-induced phosphorylation site to the region spanning residues 1–168 of IκB-β. To determine whether the apoptosis-regulated phosphorylation site was a Tyr residue or a Ser/Thr residue, we used genistein, a broad spectrum pharmacological inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. Addition of genistein to the in vitro kinase assay abolished the differential phosphorylation of GST-IκB-β (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the HK-induced phosphorylation occurred at a Tyr residue. In comparison, other inhibitors, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, the Akt inhibitor ML-9, and the casein kinase-II inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, did not affect the differential phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 3A).
