https://openalex.org/W2082712001,Five moderate (magnitude 6) earthquakes with similar features have occurred on the Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault in central California since 1857. The next moderate Parkfield earthquake is expected to occur before 1993. The Parkfield prediction experiment is designed to monitor the details of the final stages of the earthquake preparation process; observations and reports of seismicity and aseismic slip associated with the last moderate Parkfield earthquake in 1966 constitute much of the basis of the design of the experiment.

The polychaete Capitella capitata, however, was found to derive a major portion of its nitrogen from the plant substrate when it feeds on detritus derived from seaweed. Microbes play a role as a nitrogen source for this detritivore when it feeds on detritus derived from marsh grass."

New surface related results include the observation of surfaces with negative positron affinity and the thermionic emission of slow positronium atoms, low-energy positron diffraction measurements, and the sensitive detection of near-surface crystalline imperfections. Two recent successful experiments in atomic physics are the formation of the positronium negative ion and the optical excitation of positronium for high precision spectroscopy. Prospects for a positron microscope and the study of exotic antimatter systems such as the two-component Fermi gas are based on the imminent possibility of enormous increases in the brightness and instantaneous intensity of positron beams."
