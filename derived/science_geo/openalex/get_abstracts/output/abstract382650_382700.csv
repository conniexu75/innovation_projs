https://openalex.org/W2052648234,"Carbon Cycle and Climate Change As climate change accelerates, it is important to know the likely impact of climate change on the carbon cycle (see the Perspective by Reich ). Gross primary production (GPP) is a measure of the amount of CO 2 removed from the atmosphere every year to fuel photosynthesis. Beer et al. (p. 834 , published online 5 July) used a combination of observation and calculation to estimate that the total GPP by terrestrial plants is around 122 billion tons per year; in comparison, burning fossil fuels emits about 7 billion tons annually. Thirty-two percent of this uptake occurs in tropical forests, and precipitation controls carbon uptake in more than 40% of vegetated land. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of ecosystem respiratory processes is a key determinant of the interaction between climate and the carbon cycle. Mahecha et al. (p. 838 , published online 5 July) now show that the Q10 of ecosystem respiration is invariant with respect to mean annual temperature, independent of the analyzed ecosystem type, with a global mean value for Q10 of 1.6. This level of temperature sensitivity suggests a less-pronounced climate sensitivity of the carbon cycle than assumed by recent climate models."

https://openalex.org/W2153685214,"It is unclear why disease occurs in only a small proportion of persons carrying common risk alleles of disease susceptibility genes. Here we demonstrate that an interaction between a specific virus infection and a mutation in the Crohn's disease susceptibility gene Atg16L1 induces intestinal pathologies in mice. This virus-plus-susceptibility gene interaction generated abnormalities in granule packaging and unique patterns of gene expression in Paneth cells. Further, the response to injury induced by the toxic substance dextran sodium sulfate was fundamentally altered to include pathologies resembling aspects of Crohn's disease. These pathologies triggered by virus-plus-susceptibility gene interaction were dependent on TNFalpha and IFNgamma and were prevented by treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. Thus, we provide a specific example of how a virus-plus-susceptibility gene interaction can, in combination with additional environmental factors and commensal bacteria, determine the phenotype of hosts carrying common risk alleles for inflammatory disease."

https://openalex.org/W2086797990,"Soft-tissue sarcomas, which result in approximately 10,700 diagnoses and 3,800 deaths per year in the United States, show remarkable histologic diversity, with more than 50 recognized subtypes. However, knowledge of their genomic alterations is limited. We describe an integrative analysis of DNA sequence, copy number and mRNA expression in 207 samples encompassing seven major subtypes. Frequently mutated genes included TP53 (17% of pleomorphic liposarcomas), NF1 (10.5% of myxofibrosarcomas and 8% of pleomorphic liposarcomas) and PIK3CA (18% of myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, or MRCs). PIK3CA mutations in MRCs were associated with Akt activation and poor clinical outcomes. In myxofibrosarcomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas, we found both point mutations and genomic deletions affecting the tumor suppressor NF1. Finally, we found that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based knockdown of several genes amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, including CDK4 and YEATS4, decreased cell proliferation. Our study yields a detailed map of molecular alterations across diverse sarcoma subtypes and suggests potential subtype-specific targets for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2099106733,"CCR5 is the major HIV-1 co-receptor, and individuals homozygous for a 32-bp deletion in CCR5 are resistant to infection by CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Using engineered zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), we disrupted CCR5 in human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) at a mean frequency of 17% of the total alleles in a population. This procedure produces both mono- and bi-allelically disrupted cells. ZFN-treated HSPCs retained the ability to engraft NOD/SCID/IL2rgamma(null) mice and gave rise to polyclonal multi-lineage progeny in which CCR5 was permanently disrupted. Control mice receiving untreated HSPCs and challenged with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 showed profound CD4(+) T-cell loss. In contrast, mice transplanted with ZFN-modified HSPCs underwent rapid selection for CCR5(-/-) cells, had significantly lower HIV-1 levels and preserved human cells throughout their tissues. The demonstration that a minority of CCR5(-/-) HSPCs can populate an infected animal with HIV-1-resistant, CCR5(-/-) progeny supports the use of ZFN-modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells as a clinical approach to treating HIV-1."

MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14334) Google Scholar). Mature miRNAs operate via sequence-specific interactions with the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of cognate mRNA targets, causing suppression of translation and mRNA decay (Ambros, 2004Ambros V.

Loss of miRNA biosynthesis, as in Dicer knockouts, is lethal, owing to mitotic catastrophe and severely defective stem cell proliferation and differentiation (Bernstein et al., 2003Bernstein E.

A large body of evidences suggests that the multigene regulatory capacity of miRNAs is dysregulated and exploited in cancer: miRNA loci are targeted by genetic and epigenetic defects, and miRNA “signatures” have been found informative for tumor classification and clinical outcome (Calin and Croce, 2006Calin G.A. Croce C.M. MicroRNA signatures in human cancers.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (6220) Google Scholar, Ventura and Jacks, 2009Ventura A. Jacks T. MicroRNAs and cancer: short RNAs go a long way.Cell. 2009; 136: 586-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Although several miRNAs are upregulated in specific tumors (Volinia et al., 2006Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Ambs S. Cimmino A. Petrocca F. Visone R. Iorio M. Roldo C. Ferracin M. et al.A microRNA expression signature of human solid tumors defines cancer gene targets.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 2257-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (4699) Google Scholar), a global reduction of miRNA abundance appears a general trait of human cancers, playing a causal role in the transformed phenotype (Kumar et al., 2007Kumar M.S.

Ittmann M. Widespread deregulation of microRNA expression in human prostate cancer.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, little is known on the underlying mechanisms or the phenotypic advantages afforded to cells by reduced miRNA expression and, if any, on the clinical relevance of this phenomenon. The present work sheds light on these questions as here we identify a microRNA family, miR-103/107, whose expression is associated with metastasis and poor outcome in breast cancer patients. miR-103/107 inhibit the expression of Dicer, causing global microRNA downregulation. miR-103/107 foster the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and are relevant for breast cancer cell migration and metastatic dissemination. miRNAs constrain gene expression by binding to the 3′UTR of messenger RNA (mRNAs); thus, genes that must remain active across different cell types, such as housekeeping genes, typically evolved 3′UTRs that are short, allowing them to escape this regulation (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14334) Google Scholar). During a survey of the 3′UTRs of several housekeeping genes, we were struck by the unusual length of the 3′UTR of Dicer (>4000 bp). As Dicer is essential for processing miRNA precursors (Filipowicz et al., 2008Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs: are the answers in sight?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3859) Google Scholar), this raised the possibility that some mature miRNAs could feed back to control Dicer expression. To explore this further, we used Pictar and TargetScan computational tools (Friedman et al., 2009Friedman R.C. Farh K.K. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar, Krek et al., 2005Krek A. Grun D. Poy M.N. Wolf R. Rosenberg L.

Genet. 2005; 37: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3703) Google Scholar) to search for miRNA binding sites in the 3′UTR of Dicer. From this analysis, the miR-103/107 family (composed of miR-103.1, miR-103.2, and miR-107) stood out for the presence of eight evolutionarily conserved binding sites, suggesting cooperative binding and biologically effective interaction (Figure 1A ). To test if miR-103/107 target Dicer, we first generated reporter constructs in which the full-length 3′UTR of Dicer, either wild-type or mutant in the miR-103/107-binding sites, was cloned downstream of the luciferase open reading frame (Lux-Dicer-3′-WT or -MUT, respectively, Figure 1B). The activity of these two reporters was compared in human U2OS cells: the wild-type reporter showed a reduced expression compared to its mutant version, as expected if the endogenous miR-103/107 were pairing to the predicted binding sites (Figure 1B, compare lanes 1 and 5). Retroviral transduction of either pri-miR-103 or pri-miR-107 expression vectors caused further inhibition of the wild-type 3′UTR reporter (Figure 1B, compare lane 5 with lanes 6 and 7) but not of the corresponding seed mutant reporter. As control, forced expression of the unrelated pri-miR-154 or shGFP had no effect on luciferase expression (Figure 1B, lane 8). Collectively, these data indicate that miR-103/107 target the Dicer 3′UTR. We next monitored to what extent miR-103/107 affect the endogenous levels of Dicer protein. In multiple cell lines, Dicer protein was specifically downregulated (about 50%–60% reduction) by expressing pri-miR-103 or pri-miR-107 (Figure 1C, left panel and Figure S1A available online). To exclude any potentially confounding effect from the viral expression system—or from flanking sequences of the pri-miR constructs—we also transiently transfected cells with the mature form of miR-107 or, as control, a mutant miR-107 that contained three mismatches in the seed-binding sequence (miR-107-MUT). Dicer protein levels were downregulated by mature miR-107 but not miR-107-MUT (Figure 1C, right panel and Figure S1B). miR103/107 affect Dicer levels acting on its 3′UTR, as lentiviral expression of Dicer lacking the 3′UTR was insensitive to miR-107 (Figure S1C). Next, we tested if miR-103/107 are causal for Dicer downregulation in a loss-of-function experimental setting. For this, we used antagomiR reagents (Krutzfeldt et al., 2005Krutzfeldt J. Rajewsky N. Braich R. Rajeev K.G. Tuschl T. Manoharan M. Stoffel M. Silencing of microRNAs in vivo with ‘antagomirs’.Nature. 2005; 438: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar) to silence endogenous miR-103/107 (antagomiR-103/107); as a control, we used a mutant version of this reagent carrying six mismatches (antagomiR-MUT) (Figure S1D). As shown in Figure 1D, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with antagomiR-103/107 specifically promoted expression of the Dicer 3′UTR-wild-type reporter and, crucially, upregulated endogenous Dicer protein, as assayed by immunoblotting (Figure 1E). Thus, Dicer levels are limited by endogenous miR-103/107. We then investigated the effects of the miR-103/107-Dicer interaction on miRNA biosynthesis, by comparing miRNAs levels in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing miR-107 or miR-107-MUT. As assayed quantitatively by qPCR, mature miRNAs were globally downregulated in the presence of miR-107, and this is phenocopied by Dicer knockdown (Figure 1F; Figures S1E and S1F; and Table S1). Sustaining Dicer expression by means of a miR-107-insensitive transgene rescues this effect (Figure 1G, Figure S1G, and data not shown). If miR-103/107 restrict miRNA processing at the level of Dicer, then the levels of miR-103/107 should directly correlate with the abundance of Dicer substrate, that is, the 70 nt precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Indeed, pre-miRNAs, but not pri-miRNAs, accumulate in miR-107-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure S1H). In sum, miR-103/107 lead to inhibition of miRNA biogenesis through Dicer downregulation. At this point, we were intrigued by the analogy between the effects of miR-103/107 on Dicer function and the hampered maturation of multiple miRNAs observed in human tumors (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7743) Google Scholar, Ozen et al., 2008Ozen M. Creighton C.J. Ozdemir M. Ittmann M. Widespread deregulation of microRNA expression in human prostate cancer.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, Ventura and Jacks, 2009Ventura A. Jacks T. MicroRNAs and cancer: short RNAs go a long way.Cell. 2009; 136: 586-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Following this lead, we first compared the endogenous levels of miR-103/107 and Dicer protein in a well-established cellular model of mammary tumor progression, consisting of four distinct cell lines, 67NR, 168FARN, 4TO7, and 4T1, all derived from a single primary tumor and whose activity as xenografts reflects the sequence of multistep progression toward metastasis (Aslakson and Miller, 1992Aslakson C.J. Miller F.R. Selective events in the metastatic process defined by analysis of the sequential dissemination of subpopulations of a mouse mammary tumor.Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar). We found that miR-103/107 expression levels increased from the nonaggressive cells (67NR, 168FARN) to metastatic lines (4TO7 and 4T1). Conversely, endogenous Dicer protein levels decreased in metastatic lines (Figure 2A ). To determine whether the expression of miR-103/107 increases with enhanced metastatic propensity in another cellular context, we analyzed SW480 and SW620 human colon cancer cell lines, derived, respectively, from the primary tumor and a metastasis of the same patient (Leibovitz et al., 1976Leibovitz A. Stinson J.C. McCombs 3rd, W.B. McCoy C.E. Mazur K.C. Mabry N.D. Classification of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines.Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 4562-4569PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2B, an inverse correlation between miR-103/107 and Dicer level could also be observed in this case. The data on cell lines suggested a possible link between miR-103/107 expression and tumor progression. We surmised that, if biologically meaningful, this mechanism might also be found in human tumors. For this, we measured mature miR-103/107 levels in a collection of breast cancer patients treated in our Institution with annotated clinical history. Patients were divided in two groups, with respectively high or low levels of miR-103/107 (Figure 2C, see Extended Experimental Procedures). Remarkably, when tested using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the miR-103/107 “high” group displayed a significant higher probability to develop metastasis when compared to the “low” group (Figure 2D). In line with our biochemical characterization of Dicer as target of miR-103/107, the “high” group tumors showed a reduced level of Dicer protein when compared to the “low” group, as assayed by immunohistochemisty (Figures 2E–2H). We next wished to extend these analyses to independent cohorts of patients. For this, we took advantage of the fact that miR-103 and miR-107 are intronic miRNAs contained in three PANK (Pantothenate kinase) loci of the human genome (i.e., PANK1, 2, and 3 corresponding to pri-miR-107, pri-miR-103-2, and pri-miR-103-1, respectively). Expressions of PANK genes paralleled that of miR-103/107 in the series of cell lines described above (Figure S2); this coexpression is in line with a previous analysis in normal human tissues (Baskerville and Bartel, 2005Baskerville S. Bartel D.P. Microarray profiling of microRNAs reveals frequent coexpression with neighboring miRNAs and host genes.RNA. 2005; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). We thus used PANK/pri-miR-103/107 expression as an approximation of miR-103/107 levels to interrogate several public gene expression datasets for which a wealth of molecular and associated clinical data is available (summing up to more than 1000 breast cancer patients, see Extended Experimental Procedures). For each dataset, tumors were divided in two groups, with respectively high or low levels of pri-miR-103/107 (see Extended Experimental Procedures for details). In agreement with our previous analyses on mature miR-103/107, the group expressing higher levels of pri-miR-103/107 displayed a significantly higher probability to develop metastasis and poor outcome when compared to the “low” group (Figure 2I and Figure S3). Taken together, our results suggest that high miR-103/107 expression is unlikely to represent a general feature of all tumors but rather identifies those associated to adverse and metastatic disease. Given the significant association between miR-103/107 expression, Dicer protein levels, and clinical relapse, we wished to establish if a similar association existed for Dicer transcripts. However, when breast cancer patients' stratification was repeated based on high or low Dicer mRNA levels, our analyses failed to detect a significant association with metastasis or outcome (Figure 2J and Figure S3). In light of the preceding data, we sought to determine more directly if the miR-103/107-Dicer connection plays a causal role in conferring aggressive traits to breast cancer cells. For this, we assayed how gain or loss of function of either miR-103/107 or Dicer impacted on cell migration, a hallmark of metastatic capacity. We first assayed 168FARN and SUM149: these cells are tumorigenic but display poor migratory capacities and contain relatively low levels of miR-103/107 (see Figure 2A and data not shown). As assayed in transwell migration assays, raising miR-103/107 in these cell lines increased migration by 8- to 10-fold, whereas overexpression of control-shGFP had no effect (Figure 3A , compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3, Figure 3B.

Note the increased motility promoted by miR-107 and siDicer, as well as the loss of epithelial morphology. Induction of migratory capacity by miR-103/107 relies on attenuation of Dicer as expression of miR-103/107 is phenocopied by shDicer SUM149 cells (reducing Dicer to about 40% its normal levels) and is rescued by coexpression of a miR-insensitive Dicer transgene that restores Dicer protein to a level near-to-endogenous (Figure 3A, lanes 4 and 5, see immunoblots in Figure S4C). Similar results were obtained in wound-healing assays with another, more aggressive cell line, MDA-MB-231 cells (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, miR-103/107 empower cell motility through Dicer inhibition. Complete loss of Dicer is detrimental for cell survival (Fukagawa et al., 2004Fukagawa T. Nogami M. Yoshikawa M. Ikeno M. Okazaki T. Takami Y. Nakayama T. Oshimura M. Dicer is essential for formation of the heterochromatin structure in vertebrate cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), whereas here we show that miR-103/107 enhance motility with no effect on cell proliferation (Figures S4B and S4D). Different degrees of Dicer downregulation may reconcile these findings, as Dicer protein is only partially downregulated by miR-103/107. To tackle this quantitative issue, we transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with increasing doses of Dicer siRNA, inducing a range of depletions, from negligible to more quantitative knockdown (Figure 3F and data not shown). As expected, full Dicer knockdown impaired cell viability and, consequently, secondarily reduced cell migration if compared to control cells (Figure 3E, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–4). Remarkably, however, partial attenuation of Dicer to levels similar to those achieved by miR-103/107 (i.e., 50%–60% reduction) potently fostered cell migration (Figure 3E, lanes 6–8 and 10 and Figure 3F). Similar results were obtained with immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells NMuMg (Figures S4F–S4H). These findings suggest that cell migration is exquisitely sensitive to the levels of Dicer, and that the degree of Dicer downregulation imposed by miR-103/107 is sufficient to unleash aggressive cell behaviors. We next tested if endogenous levels of miR-103/107 are required for cell migration in the highly metastatic tumor cell line 4T1. For this, we first silenced miR-103/107 by treatment with antagomiR-103/107. This leads to a 5-fold reduction in migratory properties similar to that one obtained by increasing Dicer expression (Figure 3G, lanes 1–3). Strikingly, loss-of-Dicer renders 4T1 cells insensitive to loss of miR-103/107, indicating that Dicer is epistatic to miR-103/107 (Figure 3G, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 4 and 5). Taken together, the data suggest that the balance between miR-103/107 and Dicer is critical to controlling cancer cell motility. The data presented so far raised the possibility that the link between miR-103/107 and Dicer could configure in vivo a metastasis-promoter/suppressor pair. To test this idea, we assayed if miR-103/107 could foster metastasis in vivo. For this, we used SUM149 cells, which form nonmetastatic primary tumors in vivo after injection in the mouse mammary gland (Ma et al., 2007Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Weinberg R.A. Tumour invasion and metastasis initiated by microRNA-10b in breast cancer.Nature. 2007; 449: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar) but retain residual lung colonization capacity when delivered through the tail vein. Notably, expression of pri-miR-107, but not shGFP (control), strongly promoted metastatic colonization (Figure 4A , compare lanes 1 and 2, and Figure 4B). In agreement with our previous in vitro characterization, this is phenocopied by partial depletion of Dicer (Figure 4A, lane 3 and Figure 4B). Conversely, rescuing Dicer expression (Figure S4C) abolished the prometastatic effects of miR-107 (Figure 4A, lane 4 and Figure 4B). Thus, Dicer serves as metastasis suppressor downstream of miR-103/107. Having established this relationship, we next asked whether miR-107 would also empower distant metastatic dissemination from primary tumor masses. For this, we implanted control (shGFP) and miR-107-expressing SUM149 cells in the mammary fat pad of immunocompromised mice. As previously shown in vitro, gain of miR-107 does not foster proliferation in vivo, not even within the competitive tumor microenviroment (Figure 4C). After 12 weeks, host mice were sacrificed and examined for the presence of metastatic lesions in the lung. Although no macroscopic metastases were detected, the staining of histological sections with anti-cytokeratin antibodies revealed the presence of micrometastatic foci in the lungs explanted from mice bearing the SUM149-miR-107 xenografts, whereas almost none were found in mice injected with control cells (Figures 4D and 4E). Thus, once overexpressed, miR-107 is a prometastatic factor that unleashes the ability to initiate distant dissemination in otherwise nonmetastatic cells. Further, these data provide functional support to the association between miR-103/107 and clinical relapse previously revealed in human tumors. We next asked if continuous repression of Dicer by endogenous miR-103/107 in aggressive cells is required for metastatic spread in vivo. For this, 4T1 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of recipient mice and tumors treated either with antagomiR-103/107 or antagomiR-MUT (see Experimental Procedures). As shown in Figure 5A , we found that the onset and size of primary tumors were comparable in the two groups of mice (p value > 0.05), despite the quantitative loss of endogenous mature miR-103/107 in antagomiR-103/107-treated primary tumors (Figure 5B). Strikingly, however, although the antagomiR-MUT receiving cells invaded the lung parenchyma, silencing of miR-103/107 efficiently reduced metastatic colonization (Figures 5C, 5D, and 5E). This occurred without detectable detrimental effects on normal mammary glands (Figure S5A ). Thus, endogenous miR-103/107 is critical for efficient metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells.Figure S5Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) AntagomiR-103/107 administration in the fat-pad of wild-type mice has no effects on mammary gland structure and morphology.

While the general composition of the intestinal microbiota is similar in most healthy people, with greater than 90% of the cells belonging to the Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes phyla (Dethlefsen et al., 2008Dethlefsen L.

Community membership and function of the microbiota can change due to numerous variables including antibiotic treatment, inflammation, or changes in diet (Dethlefsen et al., 2008Dethlefsen L. Huse S.

Protracted loss of the typical composition has been associated with several disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases (Frank et al., 2007Frank D.N. St Amand A.L. Feldman R.A. Boedeker E.C.

In addition, changes in composition have been associated with obesity and weight loss; however, factors that cause these changes are not well defined (Duncan et al., 2008Duncan S.H. Lobley G.E.

Turnbaugh P.J. Klein S. Gordon J.I. Microbial ecology: human gut microbes associated with obesity.Nature. 2006; 444: 1022-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (5257) Google Scholar). The alterations in community membership, whether chronic or short-term, are accompanied by changes in the microbiota's collective genome, or microbiome, and the patterns and metabolic capabilities it specifies (Turnbaugh et al., 2009Turnbaugh P.J. Hamady M. Yatsunenko T. Cantarel B.L. Duncan A. Ley R.E. Sogin M.L. Jones W.J.

Therefore, the mechanisms that link relevant variables, such as changes in diet, to changes in the microbiome, are integral to understanding how environmental factors and behavior influence human biology. Many complex plant polysaccharides in the human diet are resistant to host-mediated degradation due to either insolubility or lack of human-encoded hydrolytic enzymes (Flint et al., 2008Flint H.J.

Glycan foraging in vivo by an intestine-adapted bacterial symbiont.Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). These carbohydrates are not absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and serve as a major source of carbon and energy for the distal gut microbial community. Polysaccharide degradation is one of the core functions encoded in the microbiome (Lozupone et al., 2008Lozupone C.A. Hamady M. Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gordon J.I. Knight R.

Broad expansion of the genes and operons dedicated to degrading and consuming polysaccharides has occurred within the genomes of microbiota-resident species (Xu et al., 2003Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L.K. Chiang H.C. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I.

Latreille P. et al.Evolution of Symbiotic Bacteria in the Distal Human Intestine.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), a logical outcome of the intense competition for these resources. It is, therefore, expected that alterations in the type and quantity of polysaccharides consumed can result in changes in the microbiota community composition and function. Inulin- and levan-type fructans (homopolymers of β2-1 or β2-6 fructose units, respectively) are common dietary plant polysaccharides that feed the intestinal microbiota (Roberfroid et al., 1993Roberfroid M.

Multiple bacterial taxa in the gut utilize fructans, including members of Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium, (Duncan et al., 2003Duncan S.H. Scott K.P. Ramsay A.G. Harmsen H.J.

Lack of predictability in how the microbiota responds to such dietary interventions reflects our limited understanding of nutrient sensing and utilization by members of the intestinal microbiota. Bacteroides, a major genera in the human microbiota, have a widely expanded capacity to use diverse types of dietary polysaccharides (Xu et al., 2007Xu J. Mahowald M.A. Ley R.E. Lozupone C.A. Hamady M. Martens E.C. Henrissat B. Coutinho P.M. Minx P. Latreille P. et al.Evolution of Symbiotic Bacteria in the Distal Human Intestine.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Much of the glycan degrading and import machinery within Bacteroides genomes are encoded within clusters of coregulated genes known as polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). B. thetaiotaomicron (Bt), a prototypic member of the Bacteroides, possesses 88 PULs, which differ in polysaccharide specificity (Martens et al., 2008Martens E.C. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. Mucosal glycan foraging enhances fitness and transmission of a saccharolytic human gut bacterial symbiont.Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 447-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The defining characteristic of a PUL is the presence of a pair of genes homologous to Bt susD and susC, which encode outer membrane proteins that bind and import starch oligosaccharides, respectively (Figure 1A ) (Martens et al., 2009Martens E.C. Koropatkin N.M. Smith T.J. Gordon J.I. Complex glycan catabolism by the human gut microbiota: The bacteroidetes Sus-like paradigm.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24673-24677Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, Shipman et al., 2000Shipman J.A. Berleman J.E. Salyers A.A. Characterization of four outer membrane proteins involved in binding starch to the cell surface of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5365-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The pair of susC and susD homologs is usually associated with genes that encode the machinery necessary to convert extracellular polysaccharides into intracellular monosaccharides, such as glycoside hydrolases (susA, susB, and susG in Figure 1A). In addition to machinery for polysaccharide acquisition, most PULs contain, or are closely linked to, a gene or genes encoding an inner membrane-associated sensor-regulator system, including the novel hybrid two-component systems (HTCS) (Sonnenburg et al., 2006Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Manchester J.K. Hansen E.E. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. A hybrid two-component system protein of a prominent human gut symbiont couples glycan sensing in vivo to carbohydrate metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 8834-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Bt's genome encodes 32 of these HTCS, which may mediate the rapid and specific responses required in the dynamic nutrient environment of the intestine. Here, we dissect a Bt PUL required for utilization of fructans to better understand how Bacteroides species acquire and process this common class of dietary carbohydrates. In addition, we provide evidence that the associated HTCS controls the expression of the fructan PUL and that monomeric fructose is the activating signal that binds directly to the periplasmic sensor domain of the regulatory protein. These data provide an example of a well-defined ligand for a member of this class of sensor regulators. The fructan PUL is conserved to varying extents among Bacteroides species, corresponding to a range of fructan utilization capability across the genus. Using model intestinal microbiotas living within gnotobiotic mice, we demonstrate that dietary fructan can have disparate effects on community composition, depending upon the fructan degrading capacity of members of the microbiota. These studies suggest that within personal microbiomic datasets, we will be able to identify genetic biomarkers of discrete functions. Inference of function from these biomarkers should provide predictive power in determining how an individual's microbiota will respond to changes in diet and other interventions. BT1757-BT1763 and BT1765 encodes eight open reading frames on the negative strand of the Bt genome, including one susC/susD homolog pair (BT1763 and BT1762), a putative outer membrane lipoprotein (BT1761), a putative inner membrane monosaccharide importer (BT1758), a putative fructokinase (BT1757), and three putative glycoside hydrolases (BT1759, BT1760, BT1765) (Figure 1A). These glycoside hydrolases are members of Glycoside Hydrolase Family 32 (GH32), a family of enzymes specific for fructans (Cantarel et al., 2009Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for Glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar). One of these, BT1760, possesses a N-terminal lipidation motif and is predicted to reside on the cell surface; the other two, BT1759 and BT1765, are predicted to be periplasmic and intracellular, respectively (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/ and www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). Directly adjacent to the locus is a putative inner membrane-associated sensor regulator of the HTCS family, BT1754. These data suggest that this PUL encodes the proteins required for Bt's use of fructans. Expression profiling of Bt in rich medium has revealed the upregulation of several PULs, each of which is confined to a discrete phase of growth (Sonnenburg et al., 2006Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Manchester J.K. Hansen E.E. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. A hybrid two-component system protein of a prominent human gut symbiont couples glycan sensing in vivo to carbohydrate metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 8834-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Analysis of Bt transcriptional profiles at five time points that spanned from early log to stationary phase in vitro in rich medium, compared to basal expression in minimal medium (MM) containing glucose as the sole carbohydrate, revealed that 14 pairs of susC/susD homologs were induced greater than 20-fold at one or more time points during the growth (Figure 1B) (Gene Expression Omnibus database, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; accession numbers, GSM 40897–40926). The putative fructan PUL showed upregulation early in Bt's growth suggesting it is responsive to a high priority substrate accessed early in growth on rich medium (Figure 1B). Genes within this PUL are coexpressed both in vitro in rich medium and in vivo in Bt mono-associated gnotobiotic mice fed a polysaccharide-rich diet (Figure S1A available online), consistent with the functional relatedness of adjacent genes and operon predictions in Bt (Westover et al., 2005Westover B.P. Buhler J.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Gordon J.I. Operon prediction without a training set.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bt increases expression of this PUL in vivo while downregulating the vast majority of other PULs when bi-associated in the gnotobiotic mouse intestine with the methanogenic archeon, Methanobrevibacter smithii (Samuel and Gordon, 2006Samuel B.S. Gordon J.I. A humanized gnotobiotic mouse model of host-archaeal-bacterial mutualism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10011-10016Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The upregulation of the putative fructan PUL is concomitant with increased densities of Bt in vivo, suggesting that expression of this locus is associated with growth potentiation of Bt. We inoculated minimal medium containing specific fructose-based carbohydrates as the only carbon and energy source with Bt to test if the bacterium is competent to grow on fructans. Bt grew on a broad range of fructose-based glycans, including free fructose, sucrose, levan (high MW fructose polymer with predominantly β2-6-linkages), and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS; short-chain β2-1 polymers of 2–10 fructose units) (Figure 1C; see Figure S2 for carbohydrate structures). However, Bt grew poorly on inulin (β2-1 fructose polymer with an average degree of polymerization of ∼25), with growth only apparent three days after inoculation. Doubling times on simple monosaccharides and disaccharide were similar to one another (Table S1). In contrast, growth rates of Bt between the different fructans showed large linkage-dependent differences: β2-6 levan resulted in the fastest doubling time (2.7 hr), while β2-1 FOS and inulin were significantly slower (doubling times of 5.6 hr and 96.4 hr, respectively) (Table S1). To determine whether these fructose-based substrates induced expression of genes associated with the putative fructan PUL, Bt was grown in either glucose or one of five fructose-containing substrates (fructose, sucrose, levan, FOS, or inulin) as the sole carbohydrate. Cells were harvested at mid-log phase for quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis, and RNA levels of the 3′ and the 5′ ends of the operon, BT1757 (encoding the fructokinase) and BT1763 (encoding the SusC-like protein), respectively, were used as an indicator of PUL expression (Figure 1D). Both BT1757 and BT1763 were dramatically upregulated in all media containing fructose, whether as a free monosaccharide or in glycosidic linkage. Across all conditions, expression of BT1757, BT1763, and BT1765 showed coordinated increases consistent with the predicted operon structure. However, BT1754 (the PUL-associated putative HTCS) showed no significant induction under all conditions tested. Therefore, the operon that encodes the structural genes of Bt's putative fructan PUL is transcriptionally responsive to fructose-containing carbohydrates. Published surveys of Bt gene expression in numerous carbohydrates support that upregulation of the fructan PUL is specific to fructose-containing substrates (Martens et al., 2009Martens E.C. Koropatkin N.M. Smith T.J. Gordon J.I. Complex glycan catabolism by the human gut microbiota: The bacteroidetes Sus-like paradigm.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24673-24677Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, Sonnenburg et al., 2005Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Glycan foraging in vivo by an intestine-adapted bacterial symbiont.Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Two genes within Bt's genome that are not physically associated with the putative fructan PUL, a second putative periplasmic GH32 (BT3082) and a second putative fructokinase (BT3305), were likely candidates to be involved in fructan utilization. Analysis of BT3082 and BT3305 expression by qPCR revealed that BT3082 was induced in all fructose-containing media and showed a pattern of induction consistent with those seen for BT1757, BT1763, and BT1765 (Figure 1D); however, BT3305 showed no change in expression or a slightly reduced expression in all conditions (data not shown). These data suggest that the fructosidase, BT3082, but not the putative fructokinase, BT3305, is part of the regulon of the putative fructan PUL. We assessed the ability of an isogenic mutant of Bt lacking the BT1754 gene to grow in a panel of fructose-based minimal media to test if upregulation of the PUL was dependent upon the HTCS signaling sensor. An in-frame, unmarked deletion of BT1754 was constructed using a standard counter-selectable allele-exchange procedure. Bt-ΔBT1754 exhibited normal colony morphology on solid medium and grew with a similar doubling time to wild-type in MM-glucose (2.6 hr); however, Bt-ΔBT1754 failed to grow in any of the three fructans (FOS, inulin and levan) and showed retarded growth in fructose and sucrose (Figure 2A and Table S1). Additionally, Bt-ΔBT1754 does not exhibit prioritized upregulation of the putative fructan PUL during growth in rich media (Figure S1B). Complementation of this mutant was achieved by introducing the genomic fragment containing BT1754 and its 5′ intergenic upstream promoter region in trans. Growth of the ΔBT1754::BT1754 complemented mutant restored growth in all fructose-based media to levels comparable to wild-type (Figure 2A and Table S1). These data demonstrate the HTCS encoded by BT1754 is required for Bt's use of fructans. One of the key unanswered questions concerning the HTCS family, and many other extracellular sensory systems, is the identity of the molecular triggers for signaling events. The predicted inner-membrane localization of Bt's HTCS family members, including BT1754, suggests that the periplasmic region likely serves as the sensor/receptor, similar to classic two-component systems. Analysis of the sequence of BT1754 revealed a typical HTCS architecture with an N-terminal predicted periplasmic sensor domain flanked by two transmembrane regions and a C-terminal cytoplasmic histidine kinase domain, a phosphoacceptor domain and a response regulator (including a receiver and an HTH_AraC-type DNA binding domain) (Figure 2B and Figure S3). Uniquely within Bt's HTCS, the sensor domain displays homology to Type I bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) (Dwyer and Hellinga, 2004Dwyer M.A. Hellinga H.W. Periplasmic binding proteins: a versatile superfamily for protein engineering.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). As PBPs are known to bind small molecules such as sugars, we expressed the periplasmic domain of BT1754 (BT1754-PD; residues 29–343) in a recombinant form and tested for binding to a range of monosaccharides and fructan-derived oligosaccharides to see if direct interaction with a specific carbohydrate is the means of signal perception in BT1754. The isothermal calorimetry data reveal that BT1754-PD binds specifically to fructose, with a Kd of ∼2 μM and a stoichiometry of 1:1, but does not interact with either β2-1- or β2-6-linked fructooligosaccharides or any other monosaccharides, including glucose and ribose (Figure 2C). To understand the mechanism of signal perception in more detail, we determined the structure of BT1754-PD in complex with fructose to 2.66Å. The closest homolog with known structure, a ribose-binding PBP from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (TtRBP), PDB 2IOY, was used as a molecular replacement search model. Successful molecular replacement resulted in a dimer in the asymmetric unit. A least-squares alignment of the final model with TtRBP gave a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å for 269 alpha carbons despite the relatively low sequence identity, indicative of the high structural conservation of this family. The BT1754-PD structure comprises a typical two-subdomain PBP-fold, with each subdomain consisting of a core of six β strands flanked by two or three α helices (Figure 3A ). The polypeptide chain forms a hinge by crossing between the two subdomains three times along one side, the last of these exiting the PBP-fold and then forming a long α-helix, which extends back along the length of the protein to the N-terminal region (Figure 3A). The C-terminal helix of BT1754-PD provides the predominant interface for homo-dimerization and is the main structural difference between classical soluble PBPs such as the TtRBP and BT1754-PD (Figure 3B). Though there are several hydrogen bonds to retain the turn between the PBP-fold and the helix, once the polypeptide has progressed beyond the first residue of the helix (Asn306), the remainder of the contacts, both inter- and intramolecular, are nonpolar. The dimer, generating a buried surface area of 2640 Å2, appears to be biologically relevant as both the N- and C-termini of each molecule are oriented such that they face in the same direction and, therefore, both molecules are positioned correctly for insertion into the membrane (Figure 3A). Crystals were grown in the presence of fructose, and electron density indicative of a fructose molecule in the β-furanose form was observed in the cleft between the two subdomains, the typical binding site of PBP family proteins (Dwyer and Hellinga, 2004Dwyer M.A. Hellinga H.W. Periplasmic binding proteins: a versatile superfamily for protein engineering.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)(Figure 3A). The sugar ring is sandwiched between two tryptophan residues, one from each subdomain (Trp45 and Trp196), with Tyr271 and Pro168 also forming hydrophobic contacts along the C4-C6 edge of the fructose ring (Figure 3C). All remaining interactions with the sugar are polar, with multiple H-bonds formed between side chains, mainly Arg and Asp, and the hyroxyls and ring oxygen of the fructose (Figure 3D). In common with other PBPs, solvent is excluded from the binding site itself. The structural and biochemical data for BT1754-PD binding to fructose are consistent with the increased expression of the fructan PUL observed in minimal medium containing only fructose (Figure 1D). Furthermore, the structural data suggest that signal transduction in BT1754 is driven by a conformational change of the periplasmic domain on fructose binding that is transmitted across the membrane via a “piston-like” movement of the TM helices, similar to that postulated for other sensor kinases (Falke and Erbse, 2009Falke J.J. Erbse A.H. The Piston Rises Again.Structure. 2009; 17: 1149-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The lack of linkage recognition by the HTCS sensor suggested that the β2-6-linkage specificity of Bt's fructan use was encoded within the structural genes of the fructan PUL. We first focused on genes encoding GH32 enzymes, the main family of hydrolases that catalyze the depolymerization of fructans (Cantarel et al., 2009Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for Glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar). Three GH32 enzymes (BT1759, BT1760, and BT1765) are encoded within the fructan PUL; the other GH32 family member, BT3082, is not encoded within the PUL, but is coregulated (Figure 1D). To test whether the only putative cell surface GH32 in Bt, BT1760, is required for levan utilization, an in-frame, unmarked deletion of BT1760 was constructed. Bt-ΔBT1760 exhibited normal colony morphology on solid medium and grew with a normal doubli"
https://openalex.org/W2161570516,"The BBSome is a complex of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) proteins that shares common structural elements with COPI, COPII, and clathrin coats. Here, we show that the BBSome constitutes a coat complex that sorts membrane proteins to primary cilia. The BBSome is the major effector of the Arf-like GTPase Arl6/BBS3, and the BBSome and GTP-bound Arl6 colocalize at ciliary punctae in an interdependent manner. Strikingly, Arl6(GTP)-mediated recruitment of the BBSome to synthetic liposomes produces distinct patches of polymerized coat apposed onto the lipid bilayer. Finally, the ciliary targeting signal of somatostatin receptor 3 needs to be directly recognized by the BBSome in order to mediate targeting of membrane proteins to cilia. Thus, we propose that trafficking of BBSome cargoes to cilia entails the coupling of BBSome coat polymerization to the recognition of sorting signals by the BBSome."
https://openalex.org/W2050517163,"Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian and colleagues show that androgen signaling promotes recruitment of androgen receptor and TOP2B to sites of TMPRSS2-ERG genomic breakpoints, triggering TOP2B-mediated double-strand breaks. These findings provide insights into the mechanism underlying this common prostate cancer gene fusion event. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can lead to the development of genomic rearrangements, which are hallmarks of cancer. Fusions between TMPRSS2, encoding the transmembrane serine protease isoform 2, and ERG, encoding the v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog, are among the most common oncogenic rearrangements observed in human cancer. We show that androgen signaling promotes co-recruitment of androgen receptor and topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B) to sites of TMPRSS2-ERG genomic breakpoints, triggering recombinogenic TOP2B-mediated DSBs. Furthermore, androgen stimulation resulted in de novo production of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts in a process that required TOP2B and components of the DSB repair machinery. Finally, unlike normal prostate epithelium, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia cells showed strong coexpression of androgen receptor and TOP2B. These findings implicate androgen-induced TOP2B-mediated DSBs in generating TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements."

Several themes have emerged from these studies. First, L1Hs elements can be stratified into several subfamilies (pre-Ta, Ta-0, Ta-1, Ta1-d, Ta1-nd) based upon the presence of diagnostic sequence variants contained within their 5′ and/or 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (Boissinot et al., 2000Boissinot S.

Second, many L1Hs elements are dimorphic in that they are differentially present in individual genomes and/or are present in an individual but absent from the haploid Human Genome Reference sequence (HGR) (Badge et al., 2003Badge R.M.

Third, it has been estimated that the average human genome contains ∼80–100 active (retrotransposition-competent) L1Hs elements, and that only a small number of highly active L1Hs elements (“hot” L1s) account for the bulk of retrotransposition activity in the HGR (Brouha et al., 2003Brouha B.

Here, we employed a fosmid-based, paired-end DNA resource to identify full-length L1Hs elements in the genomes of six individuals of diverse geographic origin. Over half (37/68) of the newly identified L1s were hot for retrotransposition when examined in a cultured cell assay (Moran et al., 1996Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H. High frequency retrotransposition in cultured mammalian cells.Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Genotyping a subset of these L1s further revealed that some are likely restricted to Africans, whereas others are absent from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) (Cann et al., 2002Cann H.M. de Toma C. Cazes L. Legrand M.F. Morel V. Piouffre L. Bodmer J. Bodmer W.F. Bonne-Tamir B. Cambon-Thomsen A. et al.A human genome diversity cell line panel.Science. 2002; 296: 261-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they are present at very low allele frequencies. To identify novel, full-length L1s in the genomes of geographically diverse individuals, we exploited a fosmid-based, paired-end DNA sequencing strategy that previously was used to identify structural variants in human DNA (Kidd et al., 2008Kidd J.M. Cooper G.M. Donahue W.F. Hayden H.S. Sampas N. Graves T. Hansen N. Teague B. Alkan C.

Genet. 2005; 37: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Fragments of genomic DNA approximately 40 kb in size were individually cloned using fosmid vectors (see Experimental Procedures). Sequence reads were obtained from both ends of each insert (paired-end sequences) and compared to the HGR. End sequences from genomic fragments that do not differ significantly in size from the HGR will map ∼40 kb away from each other. In contrast, paired-end sequences derived from genomic fragments containing a full-length, dimorphic ∼6 kb L1Hs element will be separated by ∼34 kb when mapped to the HGR (Figure 1) (Tuzun et al., 2005Tuzun E. Sharp A.J. Bailey J.A. Kaul R. Morrison V.A. Pertz L.M. Haugen E. Hayden H. Albertson D. Pinkel D. et al.Fine-scale structural variation of the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In general, the predicted variants were required to be supported by two fosmid clones containing putative insertions from the same individual. The size cutoffs used in our screening protocols are biased to allow the identification of full-length or near full-length L1 insertion polymorphisms, but not severely 5′ truncated L1 sequences, which are replication deficient (Table 1). Through this scheme, we should be able to identify the bulk of full-length L1s in an individual genome that are dimorphic when compared to the HGR.Table 1Summary of Data for the Six LibrariesIndividual/Library DataLINE-1 DataLibrary IDCoriell IDPopulationLibrary Mean In Silico Insert SizeSD (kb)Detection Limit (kb)Dimorphic ElementsNovel (Not in dbRIP)ActiveHotHGR “Hot” ElementsG248NA15510N/A39.892.758.2555442ABC9NA18956Japan39.512.26bDiffers from Kidd et al.

Fosmids fulfilling the above mapping criterion were subjected to a series of screens (Figure 1). First, allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization using probes directed against diagnostic sequences in the L1Hs 5′ UTR identified insertion fosmids that contained putative dimorphic L1Hs elements (Boissinot et al., 2000Boissinot S.

Second, Southern blotting with a probe directed against the 5′ UTR of L1.3 (accession# L19088) enabled the identification of fosmids that contained putative full-length L1Hs elements (Dombroski et al., 1993Dombroski B.A. Scott A.F. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Two additional potential retrotransposons isolated from a human L1 subfamily that contains an active retrotransposable element.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Third, a suppression PCR-based method (ATLAS) (Badge et al., 2003Badge R.M. Alisch R.S. Moran J.V. ATLAS: a system to selectively identify human-specific L1 insertions.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 823-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and/or direct sequencing was used to verify the presence of a full-length (or near full-length) L1Hs element in the fosmid. Finally, genomic sequences flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends of the newly identified L1Hs elements were used as probes in BLAT searches (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command = start) (Kent, 2002Kent W.J. BLAT–the BLAST-like alignment tool.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (5644) Google Scholar) to confirm that the L1 was absent from the HGR (NCBI build 36.1/hg18). Flanking sequences also were used to determine whether any of the L1Hs elements were present in a database of known polymorphic retrotransposon insertions (dbRIP; http://dbrip.brocku.ca/) (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Song L. Grover D. Azrak S. Batzer M.A. Liang P. dbRIP: a highly integrated database of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in humans.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Two additional L1Hs elements were identified through direct sequencing of the fosmids (#1-(2-1) and 3-(2-1)). We first conducted a pilot study to examine a fosmid library from a female individual (G248; NA15510) for full-length L1Hs insertions (Table 1) (Tuzun et al., 2005Tuzun E. Sharp A.J. Bailey J.A. Kaul R. Morrison V.A. Pertz L.M. Haugen E. Hayden H. Albertson D. Pinkel D. et al.Fine-scale structural variation of the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that this library was optimized for identifying ∼8 kb insertion polymorphisms as part of the Human Genome Structural Variation project (HGSV) (Kidd et al., 2008Kidd J.M. Cooper G.M. Donahue W.F. Hayden H.S. Sampas N. Graves T. Hansen N. Teague B. Alkan C. Antonacci F. et al.Mapping and sequencing of structural variation from eight human genomes.Nature. 2008; 453: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, Tuzun et al., 2005Tuzun E. Sharp A.J. Bailey J.A. Kaul R. Morrison V.A. Pertz L.M. Haugen E. Hayden H. Albertson D. Pinkel D. et al.Fine-scale structural variation of the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), we were able to identify five novel L1Hs elements using our screening protocol (Table 1). The above data provided “proof of principle” that our strategy was effective for identifying full-length, dimorphic L1Hs elements. Thus, we next screened fosmid libraries from five females representing four distinct geographic populations that were studied as part of the HapMap project (one Japanese [NA18956], one Chinese [NA18555], one Western European CEPH [NA12878], and two Yoruban individuals [NA19240, NA19129]) (International HapMap Consortium, 2005International HapMap Consortium A haplotype map of the human genome.Nature. 2005; 437: 1299-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar, Kidd et al., 2008Kidd J.M. Cooper G.M. Donahue W.F. Hayden H.S. Sampas N. Graves T. Hansen N. Teague B. Alkan C. Antonacci F. et al.Mapping and sequencing of structural variation from eight human genomes.Nature. 2008; 453: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Size cutoffs allowed detection of insertion polymorphisms as small as ∼4.2–5.5 kb and enabled the identification of an additional 64 L1Hs elements (Table 1) (Kidd et al., 2008Kidd J.M. Cooper G.M. Donahue W.F. Hayden H.S. Sampas N. Graves T. Hansen N. Teague B. Alkan C. Antonacci F. et al.Mapping and sequencing of structural variation from eight human genomes.Nature. 2008; 453: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). As our strategy is biased toward finding novel, full-length L1s, we generally observed a decrease in the number of L1Hs elements identified in each successive library screen (e.g., ABC13 was the last library analyzed and contained relatively few novel L1Hs elements). In total, we identified 69 L1Hs elements that were absent from the HGR, one of which was identified in two different individuals (#4-1 and 5-77). This element also was completely annotated in dbRIP, unlike 65 of the distinct 68 L1s identified in this study (Table 1). The number of elements discovered at each stage of the analysis is detailed in the Extended Experimental Procedures. We next tested if the L1Hs elements identified in our screens were active for retrotransposition in cultured cells. Sixty-seven elements were cloned into either a pBluescript and/or pCEP4 L1 expression vector that contained an mneoI retrotransposition indicator cassette in its 3′ UTR (#2-42 was refractory to cloning; details in Experimental Procedures) (Freeman et al., 1994Freeman J.D. Goodchild N.L. Mager D.L. A modified indicator gene for selection of retrotransposition events in mammalian cells.Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 46PubMed Google Scholar, Moran et al., 1996Moran J.V.

High frequency retrotransposition in cultured mammalian cells.Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The pBluescript-based L1 constructs lack an exogenous promoter; thus, L1 expression is driven from its native 5′ UTR. Elements isolated from libraries ABC11–13 were assayed in this context. L1s isolated from the G248, ABC9, and ABC10 libraries were assayed in pCEP4 (CMV+/5′UTR+) and/or pBluescript (5′UTR+) based contexts. The resultant plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells and successful retrotransposition events were detected as G418-resistant foci (Figure 2A ) (Moran et al., 1996Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P.

High frequency retrotransposition in cultured mammalian cells.Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Retrotransposition activities are reported relative to L1.3, and hot refers to an L1 that jumps at >10% of L1.3 (see Table S1 available online). Notably, 22 elements yielded similar retrotransposition efficiencies relative to L1.3 when tested in either a CMV+/5′UTR+ or a 5′UTR+ context (data not shown). Since the subcloning procedure does not involve PCR, we truly are testing the retrotransposition capability of each of the identified L1Hs elements in our screen. Each individual contained between three and nine hot L1s in their genome and 55% (37/67) of the L1Hs elements tested were hot for retrotransposition (Figures 2A and 2B; Table 1). These 37 hot L1Hs elements represent an approximately 4-fold increase in the number of hot L1s identified in previous studies (Badge et al., 2003Badge R.M. Alisch R.S. Moran J.V.

With each passing generation, Alu and L1 elements “jump” to new genomic locations through the process of germline retrotransposition, thereby expanding the number of element copies in our genomes (Ostertag and Kazazian, 2001Ostertag E.M.

Alu repeats and human genomic diversity.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 35: 501-538Google Scholar).

This is an impressive mutagenesis of the human genome and is collectively equivalent to one insertion for every 5 bp of chromosomal DNA. Although transposon mutagenesis is not expected to be a totally random process in the human genome, this level of mutagenesis clearly would have a major impact on human biology. However, it is presently unclear whether new insertions are indeed produced in the germline as frequently as these estimates suggest. Unfortunately, transposon mutagenesis has been difficult to study in humans because we lack efficient assays for detecting new and otherwise young retrotransposon insertions. As a consequence, most of the transposon insertions that have been detected to date are common or fixed insertions that have been discovered by genome sequencing projects (Lander et al., 2001Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. Fitzhugh W. et al.Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16517) Google Scholar, Venter et al., 2001Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W.

Holt R.A. et al.The sequence of the human genome.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (9973) Google Scholar), and relatively few rare insertions have been discovered (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Song L. Grover D. Azrak S. Batzer M.A. Liang P. dbRIP: A highly integrated database of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in humans.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Arguably, new and otherwise young insertions are much more interesting than common alleles, as purifying selection has not yet fully acted upon these young alleles and they are much more likely to disrupt genes. Thus, the full extent of germline mutagenesis by endogenous retrotransposons remains relatively unexplored in humans. For the same reason, it has been difficult to determine whether human retrotransposons are actively “jumping” in somatic tumor genomes. Such retrotransposons are, for the most part, silent in normal somatic tissues (Kano et al., 2009Kano H. Godoy I. Courtney C. Vetter M.R. Gerton G.L. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian H.H. L1 retrotransposition occurs mainly in embryogenesis and creates somatic mosaicism.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, if they were reanimated, these elements might help to drive tumorigenesis or further destabilize an already unstable cancer genome. Several lines of evidence suggest that endogenous retrotransposons might be derepressed in human somatic tumors as a consequence of altered DNA methylation (Bestor, 1998Bestor T.H. The host defense function of genomic methylation patterns.Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar, Borc'his and Bestor, 2004Borc'his D. Bestor T.H.

Activation and transposition of endogenous retroviral elements in hypomethylation induced tumors in mice.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether these elements are, in fact, mobilized at elevated frequencies in tumors. Three L1 insertion candidates have been reported in human tumors (Morse et al., 1988Morse B. Rotherg P.G. South V.J. Spandorder J.M. Astrin S.M.

Nishisho I. Horii A. Miyoshi Y. Utsunomiya J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nakamura Y. Disruption of the APC gene by a retrotransposal insertion of L1 sequence in a colon cancer.Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 643-645PubMed Google Scholar; Figure S1). Thus, as above, the extent of transposon mutagenesis in human somatic tumors remains unclear. As a step toward investigating transposon mutagenesis in normal and cancer genomes, we have developed “transposon-seq” technologies that can detect new and otherwise young retrotransposon insertions in humans. Our experiments reveal that young retrotransposon insertions indeed are highly abundant in personal human genomes and extend far beyond the number of insertions that have been detected previously. We also found that de novo L1 insertions occur at high frequencies in human lung tumor genomes. Thus, transposon-mediated mutagenesis is extensive in human genomes and is likely to have a major impact on human biology and diseases. Our goal was to develop an efficient assay that, ideally, could detect a new retrotransposon insertion anywhere in the 3 billion bp haploid human genome. We began by examining traditional gel-based L1 display assays with the hope of deriving an improved assay that could tackle this challenge (Sheen et al., 2000Sheen F.M. Sherry S.T. Risch G.M.

These linker-mediated PCR assays take advantage of specific sequence changes that are present in the youngest L1 elements (the Ta elements; Skowronski et al., 1988Skowronski J. Fanning T.G.

Although multiple laboratories have successfully used L1 display to identify novel L1 insertions, such assays are inherently low-throughput and also have high false-positive rates (Sheen et al., 2000Sheen F.M.

After attempting several modifications of this approach, we found that L1 display could be significantly improved by applying high-throughput DNA sequencing directly to the initial collections of L1-Ta junction fragments that are generated by these assays. We then applied informatics filtering to the resulting datasets to eliminate false positives and to identify high-probability L1-Ta insertion candidates. We explored both ABI capillary sequencing and 454 pyrosequencing to recover large collections of L1 insertion junctions from our linker-mediated PCR experiments (Figure 1). In our first “L1-seq” experiment, we examined 4600 PCR junction fragments by cloning them into plasmids and sequencing them with ABI Sanger capillary sequencing (Figure 1, left and Table 1). The PCR junction fragments for this experiment were generated from the genomes of (1) 24 ethnically diverse humans (the Coriell Polymorphism Discovery Panel; Collins et al., 1999Collins F.S.

A DNA polymorphism discovery resource for research on human genetic variation.Genome Res. 1999; 8: 1229-1231Google Scholar), (2) 14 additional diverse humans from the Coriell repository, and (3) 8 ATCC cell lines that were derived from human tumors (Please see Experimental Procedures and Extended Experimental Procedures). This approach was highly successful and yielded 785 distinct L1 insertions from the genomes examined (Table 1 and Table S1). After comparing these insertions to the reference human genome sequence and to previously discovered retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (deposited to dbRIP, a database of human retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms; Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Song L. Grover D. Azrak S. Batzer M.A. Liang P. dbRIP: A highly integrated database of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in humans.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), 152 novel L1 insertion polymorphisms were identified (Table 1 and Table S1).Table 1Transposon-Seq ResultsSequencing StrategySample DescriptionRetrotransposonReadsMappedDistinct RetrotransposonsPreviously UnknownPCR ValidatedABI capillary sequencingPools of diverse human DNA and tumor-derived cell line DNAL14600379578515264/66 (97%)PyrosequencingLung tumor and adjacent normal lung DNA; brain tumor and matched normal blood DNAL1286,12650,5321,389650162/182 (89%)PyrosequencingBrain tumor and matched normal blood DNAAlu35,02222,338379940353/56 (95%)The Alu and L1 transposon-seq data for this study are summarized.

Please see Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, Table S4, Experimental Procedures, and Extended Experimental Procedures for supporting data and details. To investigate these L1 insertions further, we performed a series of PCR validation studies (Table 1 and Table S1). These studies confirmed that our trace data were highly accurate (with a validation rate of 97%) and also confirmed that our collections include both common and rare L1 alleles (Table S1 and Figure 2). In contrast to dbRIP, which predominantly contains common L1 alleles (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Song L. Grover D. Azrak S. Batzer M.A. Liang P. dbRIP: A highly integrated database of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in humans.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), 30% of the L1 insertions discovered from our ABI sequencing experiments had minor allelic frequencies (MAFs) of 5% or below (compare Figures 2D and 2E). Likewise, follow-up PCR experiments revealed that 9/47 (19.1%) of the rare insertions were found only in a single human in our study (Figure 2C; MAF < 1.1%). Similar results were obtained with a second set of experiments that were conducted with pyrosequencing (Figure 2F, see below). Thus, although rare L1 insertions have gone largely undetected previously, our data clearly indicate that such insertions are abundant in human populations. Despite the fact that we examined only eight cell lines from human tumors in this initial experiment (leukemias, breast, and lung cancers), we identified what appeared to be a somatic L1 insertion in one of these cell lines. In particular, we identified an L1 insertion in the lung-tumor derived cell line NCI H1395 that was absent from the matched normal DNA from the same patient's blood (Figure 3A ). These results suggested the possibility that lung tumor genomes might support high levels of L1 mobilization. To explore this question further, we examined in parallel from the same tissue sources DNA samples isolated from 20 primary non-small cell lung cancers and 20 matched normal adjacent tissues. Because L1 is highly active in both the mouse brain (Moutri et al., 2005Moutri A.R. Marchetto M.C. Deng W. Moran J.V. Gage F.H. Somatic mosaicism in neuronal precursor cells mediated by L1 retrotransposition.Nature. 2005; 435: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) and human neural stem cells (Coufal et al., 2009Coufal N.G. Garcia-Perez J.L. Peng G.E. Yeo G.W. Mu Y. Lovci M.T. Morell M. O'Shea K.S. Moran J.V. Gage F.H. L1 retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we also examined 10 human brain tumors (5 glioblastoma and 5 medulloblastoma) and 10 matched blood leukocyte controls to determine whether somatic L1 retrotransposition might be occurring in these tumors as well. We began by retooling the L1-seq assay for 454 pyrosequencing, as this would greatly increase the throughput of the assay and allow us to examine these 60 samples with greater sequencing depth and efficiency (Figure 1). The standard 454 A and B primers were incorporated into the assay, and the PCR products were sequenced solely from the B end to avoid possible artifacts of sequencing through the L1 poly(A) tails (Figure 1, right). A similar Alu-seq assay was developed to detect young Alu insertions. For this assay, sequencing was performed from the 5′ end of Alu. In each case, 20 samples were combined into a single sequencing experiment (10 tumor and 10 matched controls), using a bar-coding strategy (Hamady et al., 2008Hamady M. Harris J.K. Gold N.J. Knight R. Error-correcting barcoded primers for pyrosequencing hundreds of samples in multiplex.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) that allowed us to assign a given sequence to a specific sample from the pool (Figure 1, right). Like the ABI L1-seq assay discussed above, this approach was highly successful and yielded 1389 distinct L1 insertions in the 60 samples that were examined (Table 1 and Table S2). After comparing these L1 candidates to the reference human genome and to dbRIP (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Song L. Grover D. Azrak S. Batzer M.A. Liang P. dbRIP: A highly integrated database of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in humans.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), 650 novel L1 insertions were identified (Table 1 and Table S2). Forty-five percent of these L1 alleles had MAFs ≤ 5% (Figures 2B and 2F). Moreover, 93% of the genomes had at least one rare L1 insertion that was present in only a single human in our study. An additional 403 novel Alu insertions were identified from the Alu assay, including both common and rare Alu alleles (Table 1 and Table S3). Like our ABI results outlined above, these pyrosequencing data clearly demonstrate an abundance of rare retrotransposon insertions in the genomes examined. We hypothesized that some of these low-frequency alleles might have been caused by new somatic retrotransposition events in the tumor genomes. Thus, we screened low-frequency alleles with PCR assays and identified nine tumor-specific somatic L1 insertions (Figure 3A). Most of the remaining insertions were considered to be germline insertions because they were found in just the normal tissue (or both tissues) of a patient or were found in multiple humans. All nine of the somatic insertions were present in the tumor tissues but were completely absent from the adjacent normal tissues (Figure 3A). Eight of the nine somatic insertions were further confirmed by cloning the PCR junction fragments that were amplified from the tumor DNAs and sequencing them (the ninth could not be sequenced because both the original DNA and the PCR products from the tumor tissue became depleted; data not shown). All of the somatic L1 insertions were found in the lung tumors, and no somatic insertions were identified in the brain tumors that were examined (data not shown). Likewise, no somatic Alu insertions were identified in the brain tumors that were examined (data not shown). Although additional studies will be necessary to determine the full spectrum of cancer genomes that are permissive for Alu and L1 mobilization, these data indicate that lung tumor genomes are highly permissive for L1 mobilization. The nine somatic L1 insertions described above (Figure 3A) were found in 6 of the 20 lung tumors that were examined. Thus, an impressive 30% of the lung tumors had at least one new L1 insertion and some tumors had two or even three new L1 insertions. Given that our assay recovers insertions from only a fraction of the genome, this 30% measurement is likely to represent the lower boundary of somatic L1 insertion frequencies in lung tumor genomes (see Experimental Procedures). As L1 is mostly silent in normal somatic tissues, this rate suggests that lung tumors behave like germline or early embryonic tissues with respect to L1 mobilization (Borc'his and Bestor, 2004Borc'his D.

Genomic DNA methylation is often altered in human lung tumors (Daskalos et al., 2009Daskalos A. Nikolaidis G. Xinarianos G. Savvardi P. Cassidy A. Zakopoulou R. Kotsinas A. Gorgoulis V. Field J.K.

Cancer. 2009; 124: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and is also thought to play a role in suppressing retroelements (Bestor, 1998Bestor T.H. The host defense function of genomic methylation patterns.Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 214: 187-195PubMed Google Scholar, Borc'his and Bestor, 2004Borc'his D. Bestor T.H.

Gaudet F. Jaenisch R. Eden A. Activation and transposition of endogenous retroviral elements in hypomethylation induced tumors in mice.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, we next used the Illumina Infinium platform to examine the genome-wide methylation status of 27,578 CpG dinucleotides in our lung tumor specimens. In order to study the relationship between DNA methylation and somatic L1 retrotransposition, patient samples were divided into two groups: (1) those with tumor-specific somatic L1 insertions and (2) those without such insertions (Figure 3B). On the basis of this classification, 59 probes were identified for which the change in DNA methylation status between the tumor and adjacent normal tissue from the same patient was significantly correlated with the L1 retrotransposition potential of the tumors (Table S6; randomly permuted datasets averaged only 1.5 significantly correlated probes). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the samples based on these 59 probes revealed a dendrogram consisting of two distinct sample groups (Figure 3B). All six patients exhibiting somatic L1 insertions were clustered together into one branch whereas 13/14 of the patients that lacked somatic insertions were clustered into a separate branch. Even though L1 insertions were not detected in tumor DNA from patient 119, this DNA was more related to the insertion-positive group on the basis of the differential methylation status of the 59 probes (see Experimental Procedures). This observation suggests (1) that the tumor DNA from patient 119 harbors an existing L1 insertion that was not detected, or (2) that this patient's tumor exhibited an environment that was permissive for L1 retrotransposition but had not yet produced a new L1 insertion. Overall, these data reveal a methylation signature that distinguishes L1-permissive lung tumors from non-L1-permissive tumors. Interestingly, all correlated probes were hypomethylated to varying degrees in the tumors relative to the matched normal tissues. Our transposon-seq methods have revealed that rare germline retrotransposon insertions are present in virtually all personal genomes in human populations and extend far beyond the insertions that have been identified in the reference human genome (Figures 2E and 2F). By applying our assays to the genomes of 76 diverse humans, we identified a total of 1145 new Alu and L1 insertions that had not been reported previously (Tables S1, Table S2, and Table S3; Lander et al., 2001Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M.

Batzer M.A. Liang P. dbRIP: A highly integrated database of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in humans.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A surprisingly large percentage of these insertions were rare. This fact is most clearly demonstrated by the relatively large number of rare insertions (with MAFs ≤ 5%) that were discovered in our study (Figures 2E and 2F) compared to the small number of rare insertions that are present in dbRIP (Figure 2D). Because we confirmed that our assays predominantly detect the very youngest and most active retrotransposons in the human genome (Table S5 and Experimental Procedures), most of these rare insertions are likely to have been generated very recently. Despite the fact that entirely different human populations were examined, we identified some of the very same full-length active L1 elements that were identified by Beck et al. in the accompanying manuscript (Beck et al., 2010Beck C.R. Collier P. Macfarlane C. Malig M. Kidd J.M. Eichler E.E. Badge R.M. Moran J.V.

Nevertheless, most of the insertions in the two datasets were detected by only one of the groups, suggesting that many additional retrotransposon insertions will be discovered in personal human genomes. Consistent with this idea, peaks of structural variation have been noted that correlate with Alu and L1 elements in the Watson genome and in other human genomes (Bennett et al., 2004Bennett E.A.

https://openalex.org/W2034634405,"Carbon Cycle and Climate Change As climate change accelerates, it is important to know the likely impact of climate change on the carbon cycle (see the Perspective by Reich ). Gross primary production (GPP) is a measure of the amount of CO 2 removed from the atmosphere every year to fuel photosynthesis. Beer et al. (p. 834 , published online 5 July) used a combination of observation and calculation to estimate that the total GPP by terrestrial plants is around 122 billion tons per year; in comparison, burning fossil fuels emits about 7 billion tons annually. Thirty-two percent of this uptake occurs in tropical forests, and precipitation controls carbon uptake in more than 40% of vegetated land. The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of ecosystem respiratory processes is a key determinant of the interaction between climate and the carbon cycle. Mahecha et al. (p. 838 , published online 5 July) now show that the Q10 of ecosystem respiration is invariant with respect to mean annual temperature, independent of the analyzed ecosystem type, with a global mean value for Q10 of 1.6. This level of temperature sensitivity suggests a less-pronounced climate sensitivity of the carbon cycle than assumed by recent climate models."

Here we demonstrate that the antiviral activity of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is post-translationally regulated by S-palmitoylation. Large-scale profiling of palmitoylated proteins in a dendritic cell line using a chemical reporter strategy revealed over 150 lipid-modified proteins with diverse cellular functions, including innate immunity. We discovered that S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 on membrane-proximal cysteines controls its clustering in membrane compartments and its antiviral activity against influenza virus. The sites of S-palmitoylation are highly conserved among the IFITM family of proteins in vertebrates, which suggests that S-palmitoylation of these immune effectors may be an ancient post-translational modification that is crucial for host resistance to viral infections. The S-palmitoylation and clustering of IFITM3 will be important for elucidating its mechanism of action and for the design of antiviral therapeutics."

CCVs have a three-layered structure with an inner membrane layer linked by clathrin adaptors to an outer polymeric clathrin scaffold (Cheng et al., 2007Cheng Y. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C.

Clathrin adaptors contain a folded membrane-proximal domain, which binds to phosphatidyl inositol polyphosphate (PIP) headgroups and/or Arf GTPases in their membrane-attached, GTP-bound forms, and at least one natively unstructured region, which harbors a clathrin-binding motif (Owen et al., 2004Owen D.J.

Transmembrane proteins are generally selected as cargo for incorporation into a CCV through the direct interaction of either widely used, short, linear sequence motifs or covalently attached ubiquitin chains with the membrane-proximal portion of a clathrin adaptor (reviewed in Bonifacino and Traub, 2003Bonifacino J.S.

Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that contain clathrin-binding motifs. The AP2 core is the site of binding to the two widely used endocytic cargo motifs, YxxΦ (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue: I, L, M, F, or V) and [ED]xxxL[LI] or “acidic dileucine” motifs, as well as to the plasma membrane PIP, phosphatidyl inositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns4,5P2). The AP2 complex therefore acts as a central hub for CCV formation, binding to clathrin, cargo molecules, accessory proteins, and membranes, and these interactions must be under strict spatiotemporal control. Two structures of the AP2 core have been solved, one with a PIP headgroup analog (inositol hexakisphosphate [IP6]) but lacking bound YxxΦ or [ED]xxxL[LI] motifs (Collins et al., 2002Collins B.M.

In the motif-free conformation first shown for AP2 and subsequently for AP1 (Heldwein et al., 2004Heldwein E.E. Macia E. Wang J. Yin H.L. Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of the clathrin adaptor protein 1 core.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 14108-14113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), both cargo-motif binding sites are blocked by portions of the β2 subunit: β2Tyr6 and β2Phe7 block the [ED]xxxL[LI]-binding site and β2Glu364–β2Val406 (especially β2Val365 and β2Tyr405) block the YxxΦ site (numbering refers to AP2) (Figure S1), and thus we term this the “locked” conformation. In the recent [ED]xxxL[LI] motif-liganded structure, which we term the “unlatched” conformation, the N terminus of β2 is displaced, allowing [ED]xxxL[LI] motif binding to occur. Although in the unlatched form the subunits of the bowl have moved a little relative to each other as compared with the locked form, the YxxΦ motif-binding site remains blocked (Kelly et al., 2008Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Spate K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Honing S. Owen D.J. A structural explanation for the binding of endocytic dileucine motifs by the AP2 complex.Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In both the locked and unlatched structures, the main PtdIns4,5P2-binding site on the α subunit and the [ED]xxxL[LI] motif-binding site are adjacent to each other and located on what was consequently proposed to be part of the AP2 membrane-interacting surface, but the YxxΦ motif-binding site is located on an orthogonal face. It has also been shown that the spacer between the end of a protein's transmembrane helix and a YxxΦ motif need only be seven residues (around 25 Å for a fully extended peptide) (Rohrer et al., 1996Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. The targeting of Lamp1 to lysosomes is dependent on the spacing of its cytoplasmic tail tyrosine sorting motif relative to the membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, in the locked and unlatched structures, the YxxΦ-binding site is 60–70 Å distant from the putative membrane-interacting surface. Taken together, these data suggested that AP2 must undergo a large-scale conformational change in order to allow binding to YxxΦ-containing cargo embedded in a PtdIns4,5P2-containing membrane. Here we present the structure of a form of AP2 in which both YxxΦ and [ED]xxxL[LI] motif-binding sites are occupied and form a coplanar arrangement with four positively charged patches that are sites for binding the PtdIns4,5P2-rich plasma membrane. Achieving this new conformation and relieving the intramolecular inhibition of the cargo motif-binding sites are facilitated by large changes occurring to the structure of the whole AP2 core. In order to compete effectively with the intramolecular blocking of the YxxΦ-binding site and so shift the equilibrium in solution to a YxxΦ-bound conformation, AP2 core was preincubated with a very large (70-fold) molar excess of the TGN38 YxxΦ peptide DYQRLN (35 μM AP2 with 2.5 mM peptide). Crystals of the AP2 complex with bound peptide grew under a number of conditions, but only those grown using mixtures of ammonium sulfate and lithium sulfate showed useful diffraction. These rhombohedral crystals diffracted anisotropically to 3.1 Å resolution in the best direction but little beyond 5 Å in the worst. Experimental phasing was carried out using the Ta6Br122+ cluster compound and cryo-trapped Xe derivatives, followed by density modification. The bowl of the AP2 core and C-μ2 could be seen in the resulting electron density (Figures 1A and 1B ). It was immediately obvious that a large conformational change had occurred, as C-μ2 was no longer located in the center of the bowl but on an orthogonal face (Figures 1E and 1F, compare Figures 1C and 1D). Model building began by placing rigid-body components of the unlatched AP2 structure into the electron density. Electron density was visible for the linker connecting the two domains of μ2, showing that most of it adopted a helical conformation (Figure 2A ), and for the YxxΦ peptide (Figure 2B). Surprisingly, electron density was also visible in the [ED]xxxL[LI] motif-binding site on σ2, although no appropriate exogenous ligand had been included in the crystallization experiments. Inspection of the electron density (Figure 2C) suggested that this “phantom” [ED]xxxL[LI] motif was part of the myc-tag sequence (MEQKLI) inserted into a surface loop of μ2 (residues 218–252) at residue 236, given that at low contour levels almost continuous density could be seen extending from the dileucine-binding site to residue 252. This loop was disordered in the locked and unlatched forms. In this “open” form, the myc-tag-containing loop reaches over to a neighboring molecule and forms a vital crystal-packing contact. When the myc-tag was removed from the loop, the resulting protein yielded no diffracting crystals under any crystallization conditions including those used here.Figure 2New Structural Features Not Found in the “Locked” StructureShow full captionThe top panels are “omit” maps, mFo-DFc difference maps calculated by omitting part of the structure, randomly displacing all the atoms a little and then refining, using the experimental phases as restraints.

The AP2 bowl can be considered as an extended helical solenoid running continuously from the N terminus of α through the interface between the α and β2 subunits' C termini to a dozen residues short of the N terminus of β2, forming a puckered ring like the seam of a tennis ball. When going from locked to the open form, the AP2 bowl collapses inwards, expelling C-μ2 (Figure 3, Figure S2, and Movie S1 and Movie S2). The collapse brings both lobes of the puckered ring closer together, while the ring dislocates between the α and β2 N termini. The “collapsed” conformation of the bowl is likely to be its lower energy state as a version of the core lacking C-μ2 altogether (μ2-truncated core) also adopts the collapsed conformation (see Extended Experimental Procedures).Figure S2Conformational Changes in the α and β2 Subunits, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) In going from the locked conformation (pale colours, α blue, β2 green) to the open conformation (dark colors), the α/β2 solenoid bowl collapses inwards into the space vacated by C-μ2, as shown by the arrows.

Other colours: σ2 cyan; N-μ2 purple; C- μ2 magenta; μ2 linker (142-160), red. The collapse of the AP2 bowl is facilitated by rotations about four “hinge points,” two each in α and in β2 (Figure S2). Thus each large subunit can be considered as being composed of essentially three rigid groups. The total buried subunit interfaces for the locked and open forms are 10,040 Å2 and 9700 Å2, respectively. Given that buried surface area is highly correlated with energy and therefore stability (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6684) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the locked form is more stable and therefore predominates in solution. The major contributions to the buried subunit interfaces come from the interactions between α and σ2, α and β2, and β2 and N-μ2, which remain largely unaltered during the conformational change (see Table S1 and Figure S3), whereas the major changes in subunit packing are those made by C-μ2 (see below) and the N terminus of β2 being displaced from the [ED]xxxL[LI] motif-binding site on σ2 (Kelly et al., 2008Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Spate K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Honing S. Owen D.J. A structural explanation for the binding of endocytic dileucine motifs by the AP2 complex.Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The most spectacular subunit rearrangement, and that of the greatest biological significance, is the movement of C-μ2 relative to the bowl. This can be described geometrically as a screw rotation of C-μ2 by ∼129° about its long axis, with a translation of 39 Å (about half its length), relative to N-μ2 (Figure 4A ). The trajectory followed by C-μ2 during the actual conformational switching must be greater than this in order to avoid colliding with β2 (see Movie S3). The subunit contacts made by C-μ2 change completely between the locked and open conformers (Figure 4B). All contacts between C-μ2 and α and between C-μ2 and σ2 are lost, and although the surface area buried between C-μ2 and β2 doubles (see below and Figure S3 and Table S1), the total subunit interface area buried by C-μ2 in the open form drops by around 1200 Å2 as compared with the locked form. However, this loss of buried surface area is partly compensated for by the 800 Å2 surface area buried by the μ2 linker binding back onto the rest of the core (see below, Figure 4 and Table S1). In the locked and unlatched forms, the μ2 linker (residues 130–158), which contains the AAK1 (α-appendage binding kinase) catalyzed phosphorylation site at μ2Thr156 (Conner and Schmid, 2002Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Identification of an adaptor-associated kinase, AAK1, as a regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), is disordered, thus making it ideally suited to recognition by the protein kinase. This phosphorylation is important for AP2 function in vivo because mutating the phosphorylation site inhibits transferrin uptake (Motley et al., 2006Motley A.M. Berg N. Taylor M.J. Sahlender D.A.

In vitro, μ2Thr156 phosphorylation enhances the binding of AP2 to endocytic motifs (Höning et al., 2005Höning S. Ricotta D. Krauss M. Spate K. Spolaore B. Motley A. Robinson M. Robinson C. Haucke V.

In the open form the linker forms a four-turn helix, which packs in a trough lined by residues from β2, N-μ2, and C-μ2 (Figure 4 and Figure S3). In the locked form this trough was present but unoccupied. It is possible that the μ2Thr156 phosphorylation event further stabilizes this helical conformation of the linker by interacting with positively charged residues in the vicinity of the trough, especially β2Arg138 and β2Lys139 (Figure S3).

Eight of 1000 small molecules tested enhanced neuron formation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Among these was an aminopropyl carbazole, designated P7C3, endowed with favorable pharmacological properties. In vivo studies gave evidence that P7C3 exerts its proneurogenic activity by protecting newborn neurons from apoptosis. Mice missing the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3) are devoid of hippocampal neurogenesis and display malformation and electrophysiological dysfunction of the dentate gyrus. Prolonged administration of P7C3 to npas3(-/-) mice corrected these deficits by normalizing levels of apoptosis of newborn hippocampal neurons. Prolonged administration of P7C3 to aged rats also enhanced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, impeded neuron death, and preserved cognitive capacity as a function of terminal aging. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W2087790185,"Connectivity in the cortex is organized at multiple scales, suggesting that scale-dependent correlated activity is particularly important for understanding the behaviour of sensory cortices and their function in stimulus encoding. We analysed the scale-dependent structure of cortical interactions by using maximum entropy models to characterize multiple-tetrode recordings from primary visual cortex of anaesthetized macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We compared the properties of firing patterns among local clusters of neurons (<300 microm apart) with those of neurons separated by larger distances (600-2,500 microm). Here we report that local firing patterns are distinctive: whereas multi-neuronal firing patterns at larger distances can be predicted by pairwise interactions, patterns within local clusters often show evidence of high-order correlations. Surprisingly, these local correlations are flexible and rapidly reorganized by visual input. Although they modestly reduce the amount of information that a cluster conveys, they also modify the format of this information, creating sparser codes by increasing the periods of total quiescence, and concentrating information into briefer periods of common activity. These results imply a hierarchical organization of neuronal correlations: simple pairwise correlations link neurons over scales of tens to hundreds of minicolumns, but on the scale of a few minicolumns, ensembles of neurons form complex subnetworks whose moment-to-moment effective connectivity is dynamically reorganized by the stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2159859860,"DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are highly toxic because they block the progression of replisomes. The Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins, encoded by genes that are mutated in FA, are important for repair of ICLs. The FA core complex catalyzes the monoubiquitination of FANCD2, and this event is essential for several steps of ICL repair. However, how monoubiquitination of FANCD2 promotes ICL repair at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we describe a highly conserved protein, KIAA1018/MTMR15/FAN1, that interacts with, and is recruited to sites of DNA damage by, the monoubiquitinated form of FANCD2. FAN1 exhibits endonuclease activity toward 5' flaps and has 5' exonuclease activity, and these activities are mediated by an ancient VRR_nuc domain. Depletion of FAN1 from human cells causes hypersensitivity to ICLs, defects in ICL repair, and genome instability. These data at least partly explain how ubiquitination of FANCD2 promotes DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2166016923,"Cancer is influenced by its microenvironment, yet broader, environmental effects also play a role but remain poorly defined. We report here that mice living in an enriched housing environment show reduced tumor growth and increased remission. We found this effect in melanoma and colon cancer models, and that it was not caused by physical activity alone. Serum from animals held in an enriched environment (EE) inhibited cancer proliferation in vitro and was markedly lower in leptin. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was selectively upregulated by EE, and its genetic overexpression reduced tumor burden, whereas BDNF knockdown blocked the effect of EE. Mechanistically, we show that hypothalamic BDNF downregulated leptin production in adipocytes via sympathoneural beta-adrenergic signaling. These results suggest that genetic or environmental activation of this BDNF/leptin axis may have therapeutic significance for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2009074048,"Cytotoxicity of cisplatin and mitomycin C (MMC) is ascribed largely to their ability to generate interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in DNA, which block the progression of replication forks. The processing of ICLs requires the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, excision repair, and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). It also requires homologous recombination (HR), which repairs double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by cleavage of the blocked replication forks. Here we describe KIAA1018, an evolutionarily conserved protein that has an N-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) and a C-terminal nuclease domain. KIAA1018 is a 5'-->3' exonuclease and a structure-specific endonuclease that preferentially incises 5' flaps. Like cells from FA patients, human cells depleted of KIAA1018 are sensitized to ICL-inducing agents and display chromosomal instability. The link of KIAA1018 to the FA pathway is further strengthened by its recruitment to DNA damage through interaction of its UBZ domain with monoubiquitylated FANCD2. We therefore propose to name KIAA1018 FANCD2-associated nuclease, FAN1."

Theory and evidence suggest that instructive UCS inputs to the amygdala will be inhibited when the UCS is expected, but this has not been found during fear conditioning. We investigated neural pathways that relay information about the UCS to the amygdala by recording neurons in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (PAG) of rats during fear conditioning.

https://openalex.org/W1991732233,"In the mammalian brain, the specification of a single axon and multiple dendrites occurs early in the differentiation of most neuron types. Numerous intracellular signaling events for axon specification have been described in detail. However, the identity of the extracellular factor(s) that initiate neuronal polarity in vivo is unknown. Here, we report that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) initiates signaling pathways both in vivo and in vitro to fate naive neurites into axons. Neocortical neurons lacking the type II TGF-beta receptor (TbetaR2) fail to initiate axons during development. Exogenous TGF-beta is sufficient to direct the rapid growth and differentiation of an axon, and genetic enhancement of receptor activity promotes the formation of multiple axons. Finally, we show that the bulk of these TGF-beta-dependent events are mediated by site-specific phosphorylation of Par6. These results define an extrinsic cue for neuronal polarity in vivo that patterns neural circuits in the developing brain."

Birney E. Altshuler D.M. Eichler E.E. Carter N.P. Hurles M.E. Feuk L. Challenges and standards in integrating surveys of structural variation.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: S7-S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These techniques are somewhat biased against the discovery of those SVs that are less than several kb long and high in copy number; these account for the majority of human SV sequence. Therefore, important gaps remain in understanding the full spectrum of human genetic variation. SV of high copy interspersed repeats or insertion sequence variations (ISVs) (Gresham et al., 2008Gresham D. Dunham M.J. Botstein D. Comparing whole genomes using DNA microarrays.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) are relatively uncharacterized. These sequences, most of which are derived from “copy-and-paste” retroelements, differ in structure, copy number, and location. They pose a significant challenge even to whole-genome sequencing, and are often underrepresented in genome assemblies. Besides representing a major class of structural variant, ISVs can serve as sites for nonallelic homologous recombination to create CNVs. Large genome-wide studies have found statistical enrichment of mobile DNAs near CNVs and translocation or inversion breakpoints (Cooper et al., 2007Cooper G.M. Nickerson D.A. Eichler E.E. Mutational and selective effects on copy-number variants in the human genome.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: S22-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, Korbel et al., 2007Korbel J.O. Urban A.E.

Du L. et al.Paired-end mapping reveals extensive structural variation in the human genome.Science. 2007; 318: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Examples of L1 or Alu involved in disease related deletions and translocation junctions are also well-documented (Gu et al., 2008Gu W. Zhang F. Lupski J.R.

Nephrol. 2010; 25: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however most were discovered by CGH and related methods which are blind to new insertions. ISVs reflecting polymorphic mobile element insertions have significant functional impact. Short interspersed elements (SINEs, such as Alus) frequently serve as gene enhancers and promoters or affect transcript structure (i.e., being incorporated into exons or used as sites for alternative mRNA splicing; (Cordaux and Batzer, 2009Cordaux R. Batzer M.A. The impact of retrotransposons on human genome evolution.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Similarly, evidence suggests that long interspersed elements 1 (LINE1/L1) can alter mRNA splicing of target transcripts (Belancio et al., 2008Belancio V.P. Roy-Engel A.M. Deininger P.

Gene-breaking: a new paradigm for human retrotransposon-mediated gene evolution.Genome Res. 2005; 15: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and may play roles in generating neuronal diversity (Muotri et al., 2005Muotri A.R.

Somatic mosaicism in neuronal precursor cells mediated by L1 retrotransposition.Nature. 2005; 435: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Intronic L1 insertions can also damp or otherwise subtly alter gene expression (Chen et al., 2006Chen J. Rattner A. Nathans J. Effects of L1 retrotransposon insertion on transcript processing, localization and accumulation: lessons from the retinal degeneration 7 mouse and implications for the genomic ecology of L1 elements.Hum.

Indeed, intronic insertions can lead to decreased transcript levels and loss of gene function in humans (Schwahn et al., 1998Schwahn U. Lenzner S. Dong J. Feil S. Hinzmann B. van Duijnhoven G.

Genet. 1999; 8: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, such intronic L1 insertions might well predispose to complex traits in humans. There are also examples of exonic mobile element insertions causing genetic diseases by germline or early embryonic integration (Kazazian et al., 1988Kazazian Jr., H.H. Wong C. Youssoufian H.

Williams R. Ockelford P. Browett P. A 20.7 kb deletion within the factor VIII gene associated with LINE-1 element insertion.Thromb.

Vogelstein B. Nakamura Y. Disruption of the APC gene by a retrotransposal insertion of L1 sequence in a colon cancer.Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 643-645PubMed Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the relative rarity of such reports reflects mobile element quiescence in the context of effective host defense mechanisms or systematic biases against their discovery. Even in a healthy individual, we still do not know the number of mobile element copies of each type present or the frequencies of these alleles in the general population. For all these reasons, we developed an effective general tool, TIP-chip, for genome-wide discovery of human insertion polymorphisms. We describe here primarily our findings using TIP-chip to identify polymorphic L1 insertions. Most ISV families (L1, Alu, and SVA) continue to accumulate in our genomes through the activity of L1, specifically, the youngest L1 family, L1PA1, also known as the “transcribed L1, subset a” or L1(Ta)s (Skowronski et al., 1988Skowronski J. Fanning T.G. Singer M.F. Unit-length line-1 transcripts in human teratocarcinoma cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1385-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In vitro assays unequivocally demonstrate the retrotransposition capacity of full-length (6 kb) intact L1(Ta)s (Brouha et al., 2003Brouha B. Schustak J. Badge R.M. Lutz-Prigge S. Farley A.H. Moran J.V. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Hot L1s account for the bulk of retrotransposition in the human population.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 5280-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, Moran et al., 1996Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H. High frequency retrotransposition in cultured mammalian cells.Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar); nearly all known human L1 polymorphisms are related to L1(Ta) insertions. Our approach for identifying L1(Ta) ISV depends on a ligation-mediated PCR (Arnold and Hodgson, 1991Arnold C. Hodgson I.J. Vectorette PCR: A novel approach to genomic walking.PCR Methods Appl. 1991; 1: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Wheelan et al., 2006Wheelan S.J. Scheifele L.Z. Martinez-Murillo F. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D. Eukaryotic Transposable Elements and Genome Evolution Special Feature: Transposon insertion site profiling chip (TIP-chip).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17632-17637Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this method, partially complementary oligonucleotides (vectorettes) are ligated to restriction enzyme (RE) digested genomic DNA. This requires first strand PCR priming from known (transposon end) sequence. The 3′ terminus of the first strand primer hybridizes to a three base pair sequence unique to the L1(Ta) subset (Skowronski et al., 1988Skowronski J. Fanning T.G. Singer M.F. Unit-length line-1 transcripts in human teratocarcinoma cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1385-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In subsequent cycles, the 3′ end of the first strand pairs with a second primer allowing exponential amplification. The resulting amplicons include the extreme 3′ end of the L1(Ta) and unique downstream DNA sequence. The amplicon mixture is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to tiling microarrays (Figure 1). TIP-chip data consist of small numbers of high intensity probes (Figure S1 available online) recognizable as peaks formed by contiguous probes when associated with corresponding genomic locations. Multiple PCR templates are generated for each genomic L1(Ta) by parallel RE digests prior to vectorette ligation. The combination of REs used maximizes genomic coverage; an insertion lies within 1–5 kb of at least one 3′ RE site in approximately 92% of the genome (Experimental Procedures). The interprobe distance on the tiling arrays used is such that for approximately 90.5% of the genome, there are three probes (average of 7) within 3 kb of an insertion. Since sequences closer to the 3′ end of an insertion are included in more RE fragments, and shorter templates amplify better, there is an inverse relationship between probe fluorescence intensity and distance from the L1(Ta). Thus, peak shapes reflect both insertion position and orientation.Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Log scale histogram of fluorescence intensity on TIP-chip.

Multiple high intensity probes compose each peak. A fraction of the peaks on the AluYb TIP-Chip line up with positions of the reference insertions. The remaining peaks denote candidate novel insertions. To evaluate the general applicability of TIP-chip to map other human mobile elements, we designed primers specific to SINEs that have been recently expanding in humans through the activity of L1(Ta), AluYa5/8 families and AluYb8/9 families, and a family of autonomous endogenous retrovirus, Hs_a HERV-K (Experimental Procedures). In all three cases we were able to detect numerous insertions of those types included in the March 2006 human reference sequence (hs_ref [hg18] NCBI Build 36.1) (Figure S1). HERV-K TIP-chip showed relatively lower numbers of insertions and levels of polymorphism, though we were able to discover nonreference LTRs. Alu insertions in contrast are abundant and highly polymorphic. In addition to intergenic and intronic Alus, we discovered a polymorphic exonic AluYb in the complement component 7 (C7) locus in the first sample we analyzed (Xing et al., 2009Xing J. Zhang Y. Han K. Salem A.H. Sen S.K. Huff C.D. Zhou Q. Kirkness E.F. Levy S. Batzer M.A. et al.Mobile elements create structural variation: analysis of a complete human genome.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, TIP-chip appears a robust method for identifying insertions of a wide variety of transposable element types. For the remainder of the paper, we focus on our experience with L1(Ta) detection by TIP-chip. To test L1(Ta) TIP-chip utility and reproducibility, we used 385K feature X chromosome genomic tiling arrays. As expected, numerous peak positions corresponded to one of the 38 known L1(Ta)s exactly matching our forward primer sequence the hs_ref (Figure 2). In a family of 4, we identified 28 peaks reflecting reference L1(Ta)s, and correctly identified orientation in 84% of these. No non-hs_ref L1(Ta) insertions cataloged in the database of human retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (dbRIP) (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Song L. Grover D. Azrak S. Batzer M.A. Liang P. dbRIP: a highly integrated database of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in humans.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or included in alternate genome assemblies (Levy et al., 2007Levy S. Sutton G. Ng P.C. Feuk L. Halpern A.L. Walenz B.P. Axelrod N.

Importantly, however, this experiment showed 6 previously unknown L1(Ta)s which were verified by 3′ junction PCR analyses (Table S1). Of the 34 L1(Ta)s seen in this family, 13 were polymorphic. All showed sex-linked inheritance. We tested whether TIP-chip could comprehensively map L1(Ta)s on a whole-genome tiling microarray (four 2.1M feature arrays). For data analysis, we developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for recognizing characteristically asymmetric peaks and imposed a multivariate cutoff algorithm for retaining peaks (Experimental Procedures). Figure 3A illustrates distribution of L1(Ta) peaks in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) DNA from a healthy individual (sample 1); data from other representative samples are included in Figure S2. In these examples, we recognize a range of total peak numbers in excess of Ne, the expected number of different L1(Ta) alleles per diploid human genome (515; see Experimental Procedures) and impose a cutoff based on this value. In the sample illustrated in Figure 3A, we retained 514 peaks, 323 of which correspond to reference L1(Ta)s. Of the 191 candidate non-hs_ref L1(Ta)s identified in the sample, 49 were in dbRIP (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Song L. Grover D. Azrak S. Batzer M.A. Liang P. dbRIP: a highly integrated database of retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms in humans.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or included in the alternate genome assemblies, 3 were confirmed by data in Beck et al., 2010Beck C.R. Collier P. Macfarlane C. Malig M. Kidd J.M. Eichler E.E. Badge R.M. Moran J.V. LINE-1 retrotransposition activity in human genomes.Cell. 2010; 141 (this issue): 1159-1170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]. We attempted to verify 139 others by site-specific PCR crossing the 3′ junction of the L1 or spanning the insertion (Table S1) and recovered amplicons consistent with 91 insertions. Of a sequenced subset, 22 were sequence-verified, a recovery which allowed us to estimate that 56 reflect true L1 insertions. Thus, of novel peaks retained by the cutoff algorithm, 108 appear to represent true insertions verifiable by data mining or PCR validation, for an overall assay positive predictive value of 84%. Additionally, in this sample, we were able to sequence verify an additional seven insertions among peaks that did not meet the cutoff. Thus, cutoff criteria can be relaxed to maximize new L1(Ta) discovery, but is kept close to Ne here to conservatively reflect the expected number of true positives.Figure S2Whole-Genome L1(Ta) Profiles of Four Individuals, Related to Figure 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of L1(Ta)s included in hs_ref serves as a quality metric; most high quality TIP-chip data sets identify about 300 of 460 perfect matches to our L1(Ta) primer present in the reference genome. This value is comparable to numbers of reference L1(Ta)s included in the alternate genome assemblies (Figure 3B). Unidentified reference L1(Ta)s can be ascribed to polymorphic insertions absent from an individual (true negatives) and undetected L1(Ta)s [false negatives, e.g., due to < 3 probes in the 1 kilobase downstream of the L1(Ta) 3′ end]. In whole-genome TIP-chip studies of 15 unrelated individuals, there are 56 reference L1(Ta)s undetected in any individual; 47 fall in this ‘probe poor’ category. Forty of these lie in repeat-rich regions [>900bp of the 1 kilobase following the L1(Ta) 3′ end are annotated by RepeatMasker (Smit et al., 2004Smit, A.F.A., Hubley, R., and Green, P. (2004). RepeatMasker: Open-3.0. 1996–2004 http://www.repeatmasker.org.Google Scholar) (Figure S3)]. For the remaining 9 insertions, insertion allele frequencies are reported for five of them in dbRIP, with four sufficiently infrequent that their absence in this sample set is expected (insertion allele frequencies 0.019–0.051). Twelve ‘probe poor’ reference L1(Ta)s are found on the X chromosome. Of these, 9 were detected on the 385K chromosome X array platform, indicating that detection difficulty on the whole-genome array does not reflect failure to amplify these sequences and could be solved by improved probe content (Figure S3). We compared L1(Ta) identification by TIP-chip directly with assembled whole-genome sequencing data for Hs_alt_huref (Venter) DNA. Xing et al., 2009Xing J. Zhang Y. Han K. Salem A.H. Sen S.K. Huff C.D. Zhou Q. Kirkness E.F. Levy S.

We found 40 more in the Hs_alt_huref assembly deposited at NCBI and an additional 32 sequence verified insertions by TIP-chip. (Table S1). To assess whole-genome TIP-chip reproducibility and address the hypothesis that L1(Ta) insertions commonly occur in early stages of human embryonic development so as to create significant somatic mosaicism (Kano et al., 2009Kano H. Godoy I. Courtney C. Vetter M.R. Gerton G.L. Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H.

Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we performed whole-genome TIP-chip analysis on PBLs (4 paired samples) or lymphoblastoid lines (1 paired sample) of 5 phenotypically discordant monozygotic twin sets. We find high agreement between L1(Ta) TIP-chip peaks in comparing these samples (Figure 4). No peak discrepancies (i.e., peak presence versus absence) were found in pairwise comparisons. We attempted PCRs at 89 peak positions showing differences in peak height between twins and discovered no insertions unique to one individual in a twin pair. TIP-chip enables assessment of L1(Ta) genotypes in numerous samples and thus is useful for determining population-based allele frequencies. Given this, we can estimate average allele frequency of the L1(Ta) complement present in any individual; a parameter we call F¯i. We determined F¯i using two independent methods, the first based on TIP-chip as the sole means of genotyping 75 males for X chromosome insertions and the second was based on whole-genome analyses (below). On the X chromosome, 161 high scoring peaks served as the basis for F¯i calculation. Of these, 33 correspond to L1(Ta) in hs_ref, and extensive validation PCRs for 10 samples on this array platform indicate a positive predictive value of 80.5% for non-hs_ref insertions (Figure S4). Nonreference L1(Ta)s showed an extremely broad range of allele frequencies (0.013 and 0.987, average 0.58; Figure 5A , Table S2). The average L1(Ta) allele frequency F¯i, was determined to be 0.75 (Figure 5B). This parameter defines genome-wide variation of this class of ISV.Figure 5Polymorphism of X chromosome L1(Ta)sShow full caption(A) Each mark represents a L1(Ta) insertion. y axis denotes position along the X chromosome and the x axis reflects allele frequencies for L1(Ta) insertions on the plus (left) and minus strands (i.e., % of males with respective insertion).

https://openalex.org/W1996140776,"Regulation of the phd/doc toxin-antitoxin operon involves the toxin Doc as co- or derepressor depending on the ratio between Phd and Doc, a phenomenon known as conditional cooperativity. The mechanism underlying this observed behavior is not understood. Here we show that monomeric Doc engages two Phd dimers on two unrelated binding sites. The binding of Doc to the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of Phd structures its N-terminal DNA-binding domain, illustrating allosteric coupling between highly disordered and highly unstable domains. This allosteric effect also couples Doc neutralization to the conditional regulation of transcription. In this way, higher levels of Doc tighten repression up to a point where the accumulation of toxin triggers the production of Phd to counteract its action. Our experiments provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of conditional cooperative regulation of transcription typical of toxin-antitoxin modules. This model may be applicable for the regulation of other biological systems."

They find that dopamine regulates spine calcium via multiple pathways. Striatal D2-type dopamine receptors (D2Rs) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Although these receptors regulate striatal synaptic plasticity, the mechanisms underlying dopaminergic modulation of glutamatergic synapses are unclear. We combined optogenetics, two-photon microscopy and glutamate uncaging to examine D2R-dependent modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in mouse striatopallidal neurons. We found that D2R activation reduces corticostriatal glutamate release and attenuates both synaptic- and action potential–evoked Ca2+ influx into dendritic spines by approximately 50%. Modulation of Ca2+ signaling was mediated by a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent regulation of Ca2+ entry through NMDA-type glutamate receptors that was inhibited by D2Rs and enhanced by activation of 2A-type adenosine receptors (A2ARs). D2Rs also produced a PKA- and A2AR-independent reduction in Ca2+ influx through R-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. These findings reveal that dopamine regulates spine Ca2+ by multiple pathways and that competitive modulation of PKA controls NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ signaling in the striatum."

The function of these nuclear bodies is unknown. We report the identification of hemera, a seedling lethal mutant of Arabidopsis with altered phytochrome nuclear body patterns. hemera mutants are impaired in all phytochrome responses examined, including proteolysis of phytochrome A and phytochrome-interacting transcription factors. HEMERA was identified previously as pTAC12, a component of a plastid complex associated with transcription. Here, we show that HEMERA has a function in the nucleus, where it acts specifically in phytochrome signaling, is predicted to be structurally similar to the multiubiquitin-binding protein, RAD23, and can partially rescue yeast rad23mutants. Together, these results implicate phytochrome nuclear bodies as sites of proteolysis.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIzZThhZmI3NWM2ZjkzYjY4MGEzY2VlMTNhMDkxNDhlZiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM0NDMyMTgwfQ.m7QVAhBEJrPgBx-Plzzns7fBZzjD7uk96pA3sCBZxJWBtJiOEXGRXV3fpGLsVj7TZB7O4OmMbm05J1iMwFupGA4JQnM6eB9O5g0DxhteGQYl4Qo13lk0gVyZCn2tzcN8shSkhU-mfmUb3cOkSk-ONpktI9HhZhJwAzxLTXlB3OvFWKPd4PjkLRmQvtenAU9Or_oqmbn9-Go_JdJWDOdqyCQ882cxb4SAIFIBrWeZWdQpDr4yvXijOAQViPw8OyTP_5aGXRgvBz2wAtsqJK_nxXLsxwLEUKKEFC2NkI-xVmK-zL929QWFWtrh1KRCPpn_7BoIdcAx5BdtmUG0YFJknQ(mp4, (15.51 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W1987848307,"Axl is expressed in various types of cancer and is involved in multiple processes of tumorigenesis, including promoting tumor cell growth, migration, invasion, metastasis as well as angiogenesis. To evaluate further the mechanisms involved in the expression/activation of Axl in various aspects of tumorigenesis, especially its roles in modulating tumor stromal functions, we have developed a phage-derived mAb (YW327.6S2) that recognizes both human and murine Axl. YW327.6S2 binds to both human and murine Axl with high affinity. It blocks the ligand Gas6 binding to the receptor, downregulates receptor expression, inhibits receptor activation and downstream signaling. In A549 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer models, YW327.6S2 attenuates xenograft tumor growth and potentiates the effect of anti-VEGF treatment. In NSCLC models, YW327.6S2 also enhances the effect of erlotinib and chemotherapy in reducing tumor growth. Furthermore, YW327.6S2 reduces the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to distant organs. YW327.6S2 induces tumor cell apoptosis in NSCLC, reduces tumor-associated vascular density and inhibits the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from tumor-associated macrophages in the breast cancer model. In conclusion, anti-Axl mAb can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anti-VEGF, EGFR small-molecule inhibitors as well as chemotherapy. Axl mAb affects not only tumor cells but also tumor stroma through its modulation of tumor-associated vasculature and immune cell functions."

Here, we discuss the intimate links between metabolic regulation and longevity and outline new approaches for analyzing and manipulating such links to promote human health span. Molecular and cellular networks implicated in aging depend on a multitude of proteins that collectively mount adaptive and contingent metabolic responses to environmental challenges. Here, we discuss the intimate links between metabolic regulation and longevity and outline new approaches for analyzing and manipulating such links to promote human health span. Life expectancy has increased steadily over the last century and almost doubled in many countries and cultures. This increase is not due to an intrinsic change in human physiology but reflects large-scale improvements in public health. The major cause of mortality is shifting rapidly from infectious diseases to a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Although treating diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia generally increases life span, there is no evidence that global application of drug interventions (e.g., statins for heart disease) improves longevity in healthy subjects. Here, we do not consider pathways that cause either rare (e.g., progeria) or common (e.g., hypertension or hyperlipidemia) diseases. Instead we focus on molecular and cellular networks that are part of an intrinsic program that controls life span in the absence of overt disease. The only intervention that consistently has been shown to increase life span from nematodes to primates is caloric or dietary restriction (Colman et al., 2009Colman R.J. Anderson R.M. Johnson S.C. Kastman E.K. Kosmatka K.J. Beasley T.M. Allison D.B. Cruzen C. Simmons H.A. Kemnitz J.W. et al.Science. 2009; 325: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar, Fontana et al., 2010Fontana L. Partridge L. Longo V.D. Science. 2010; 328: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar, Lin et al., 2002Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). How caloric restriction (CR) extends life span is still not well understood (reviewed in Canto and Auwerx, 2009Canto C. Auwerx J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 325-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but several studies demonstrate that perception and sensing of nutrient levels is important. It is likely that the absence of specific dietary amino acids mediates the effects of CR rather than the restriction of calorie intake per se (Grandison et al., 2009Grandison R.C. Piper M.D. Partridge L. Nature. 2009; 462: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, Miller et al., 2005Miller R.A. Buehner G. Chang Y. Harper J.M. Sigler R. Smith-Wheelock M. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). A diet low in the essential amino acid methionine boosts life span in the mouse and reduces age-related pathologies (Miller et al., 2005Miller R.A. Buehner G. Chang Y. Harper J.M. Sigler R. Smith-Wheelock M. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Addition of methionine alone to a CR diet also averts the reduced fecundity normally associated with CR in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster but without affecting increased longevity (Grandison et al., 2009Grandison R.C. Piper M.D. Partridge L. Nature. 2009; 462: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, whereas addition of essential amino acids to a CR diet reduced life span, this reduction in life span could be prevented by simply removing methionine from the diet, indicating that the interaction between methionine and other amino acids plays a key role (Grandison et al., 2009Grandison R.C. Piper M.D. Partridge L. Nature. 2009; 462: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Mechanisms directly linked to methionine manipulation are unknown but may involve specific metabolic sensors, many of which are extremely well conserved and often act in a cell-autonomous fashion (that is, within the cell). Possible sensors include the target of rapamycin (TOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the sirtuin proteins that detect changes in specific metabolites such as amino acids, AMP, and NAD+, respectively. Such changes, reflecting the general metabolic state, could trigger metabolic adaptations, possibly through regulators such as the forkhead box transcription factors (including the FOXO and FOXA families), SMK-1 (suppressor of MEK null), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). Interestingly, the sensory perception of nutrients is also involved in CR-induced longevity. This suggests that non-cell-autonomous signaling (relying on external cues, such as hormonal and neuronal pathways) also may be involved in the aging process (reviewed in Libert and Pletcher, 2007Libert S. Pletcher S.D. Cell. 2007; 131: 1231-1234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Blocking sensory perception in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans or D. melanogaster by ablation of the chemosensory neurons or by deletion of the odorant receptor Or83b, respectively, increases life span. Although CR still extends life span in the Or83b mutant flies, the effect was milder than in wild-type flies. Strikingly, even exposure to food odorants dampens the CR-induced life-span extension in flies (Libert and Pletcher, 2007Libert S. Pletcher S.D. Cell. 2007; 131: 1231-1234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fact that serotonin inhibitors, which in humans are used as antidepressants and often induce weight loss, also extend life span in C. elegans (Libert and Pletcher, 2007Libert S. Pletcher S.D. Cell. 2007; 131: 1231-1234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggests that specific neuronal signaling pathways may mimic the pseudostarved state. Whether and how sensory perception is also relevant in mammals merits further research. Elucidating the mechanisms by which both these cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous signaling pathways are integrated to control the response to CR will be key for understanding longevity and its natural variation. However, the beneficial effects of CR are not uniformly mediated by these pathways because their actions depend largely on the context of the CR regimen and the compensatory regulatory networks that are activated. It is therefore no surprise that depending on the timing and type of the CR, certain genes and pathways are dispensable for the effect on life span (Kenyon, 2010Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2010; 464: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). How these various signaling pathways impact longevity, whether CR-induced or natural, is still not clear. The insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway is the best characterized pathway affecting longevity (Figure 1). In C. elegans and D. melanogaster—organisms in which the insulin and IGF1 pathways converge on a single receptor—decreased insulin/IGF1 signaling increases life span by as much as 2-fold (reviewed in Kenyon, 2010Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2010; 464: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). In mammals, the role of the insulin/IGF1 signaling network in longevity is complicated by potential involvement of multiple insulin/IGF receptors. Perturbing this pathway in mice results in severe metabolic disease leading to premature death (reviewed in Russell and Kahn, 2007Russell S.J. Kahn C.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Several studies, however, have connected insulin/IGF1 signaling to longevity in mammals. Life span is clearly increased by heterozygous and tissue-specific mutations in components of the insulin/IGF1 pathway (Russell and Kahn, 2007Russell S.J. Kahn C.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The FOXO (forkhead box) transcription factors are key modulators of this insulin/IGF1 network (Kenyon, 2010Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2010; 464: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FOXO by AKT—a downstream kinase in the insulin/IGF1 pathway—results in translocation of FOXO to the cytosol and inactivation of its pro-longevity transcriptional targets. Such targets include genes involved in defense against oxidative stress and genes encoding molecular chaperones (Russell and Kahn, 2007Russell S.J. Kahn C.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, deleting daf-16 (the C. elegans FOXO homolog) in worms carrying a mutated daf2 (which have no insulin/IGF1 signaling) abrogates the life-span extension of the daf2 mutant worms (Kenyon, 2010Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2010; 464: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). The importance of FOXO in CR-induced longevity is, however, still under debate. In contrast to worm daf-16, the PHA-4 protein of C. elegans, which is homologous to the mammalian family of Foxa transcription factors, mediates the effects of CR on life span but is not required for the increased longevity caused by other genetic pathways that regulate aging (Panowski et al., 2007Panowski S.H. Wolff S. Aguilaniu H. Durieux J. Dillin A. Nature. 2007; 447: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Future research will need to address what causes these species-specific differences and how such differences can be used to influence mammalian longevity. The TOR signaling pathway is also a critical player in longevity. Initially characterized for its involvement in the antifungal effects of the drug rapamycin, TOR proteins are now recognized as sensors that link nutrient availability to cellular growth (reviewed in Stanfel et al., 2009Stanfel M.N. Shamieh L.S. Kaeberlein M. Kennedy B.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In yeast, worms, and flies, manipulation of TOR by genetic ablation or by pharmacological inhibition using rapamycin greatly improves life span (Figure 1) (Stanfel et al., 2009Stanfel M.N. Shamieh L.S. Kaeberlein M. Kennedy B.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The same beneficial effect of rapamycin was also seen in mice, where it increased mean and maximum life span, even though the animals were already old when treatment began (Harrison et al., 2009Harrison D.E. Strong R. Sharp Z.D. Nelson J.F. Astle C.M. Flurkey K. Nadon N.L. Wilkinson J.E. Frenkel K. Carter C.S. et al.Nature. 2009; 460: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Using various fly mutants, the effects of rapamycin on longevity have been linked to the regulatory role of TOR on autophagy and on translation. The ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP), both downstream effectors of TOR, are critically involved in these processes (Bjedov et al., 2010Bjedov I. Toivonen J.M. Kerr F. Slack C. Jacobson J. Foley A. Partridge L. Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The role of autophagy in longevity has been further substantiated by using the polyamine spermidine, a compound that induces autophagy, inhibits oxidative stress, and increases life span in several model organisms (Eisenberg et al., 2009Eisenberg T. Knauer H. Schauer A. Buttner S. Ruckenstuhl C. Carmona-Gutierrez D. Ring J. Schroeder S. Magnes C. Antonacci L. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Finally, the roles of S6K1 and 4E-BP in life-span extension have been confirmed in genetic models. Deletion of 4E-BP in D. melanogaster decreases life span and abrogates CR-induced longevity, whereas overexpression of 4E-BP does not enhance the effect of CR, suggesting that 4E-BP is crucial for CR-induced longevity (Zid et al., 2009Zid B.M. Rogers A.N. Katewa S.D. Vargas M.A. Kolipinski M.C. Lu T.A. Benzer S. Kapahi P. Cell. 2009; 139: 149-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Conversely, female mice lacking S6K1 live longer, healthier lives compared with wild-type littermates (Selman et al., 2009Selman C. Tullet J.M. Wieser D. Irvine E. Lingard S.J. Choudhury A.I. Claret M. Al-Qassab H. Carmignac D. Ramadani F. et al.Science. 2009; 326: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), perhaps because loss of S6K1 mimics some aspects of CR. These mice are lean and sensitized to insulin because of a decrease in the phosphorylation of threonine residues in IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) resulting in altered insulin signaling (Um et al., 2004Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. et al.Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Based on gene expression data and the characterization of worms carrying mutant S6K1 and AMPK, it seems that the beneficial effects of the loss of S6K1 on glucose homeostasis and life span are principally mediated through AMPK activation (Selman et al., 2009Selman C. Tullet J.M. Wieser D. Irvine E. Lingard S.J. Choudhury A.I. Claret M. Al-Qassab H. Carmignac D. Ramadani F. et al.Science. 2009; 326: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Sirtuins are a class of NAD+-dependent deacetylases, which deacetylate both histones and a wide range of proteins (Houtkooper et al., 2010Houtkooper R.H. Canto C. Wanders R.J. Auwerx J. Endocr. Rev. 2010; 31: 194-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The connection between sirtuins and longevity is based on the discovery that the effects of CR on life span are, at least in part, mediated by the sirtuin orthologs Sir2/SIRT1 in yeast, fly, and worm. Although the exact function of Sir2/SIRT1 in life-span extension is still not known, its activating effects on mitochondrial respiration are thought to play a crucial role (Canto and Auwerx, 2009Canto C. Auwerx J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 325-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Consistent with the link between SIRT1 function and metabolism, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SIRT1 have been associated with energy expenditure (Lagouge et al., 2006Lagouge M. Argmann C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Meziane H. Lerin C. Daussin F. Messadeq N. Milne J. Lambert P. Elliott P. et al.Cell. 2006; 127: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar) and SIRT1 expression levels are tightly correlated with insulin sensitivity in humans (Rutanen et al., 2010Rutanen J. Yaluri N. Modi S. Pihlajamaki J. Vanttinen M. Itkonen P. Kainulainen S. Yamamoto H. Lagouge M. Sinclair D.A. et al.Diabetes. 2010; 59: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Notably, a recent study showed that transgenic mice overexpressing Sirt1 have an improved health span and are protected against diseases of aging, such as diabetes and cancer, but do not show an increased life span (Herranz et al., 2010Herranz D. Muñoz-Martin M. Cañamero M. Mulero F. Martinez-Pastor B. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Serrano M. Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 1-18https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This striking absence of a longevity phenotype in Sirt1 transgenic mice underscores the pitfalls associated with translating the conclusions of studies in yeast, worm, and flies to mammals. Additional data concerning the possible relation of SIRT1 and mouse or human longevity are eagerly awaited. Finally, a potentially interesting association between polymorphisms in the SIRT3 gene, one of the mitochondrial sirtuins, and longevity was reported in a small human study (Bellizzi et al., 2005Bellizzi D. Rose G. Cavalcante P. Covello G. Dato S. De Rango F. Greco V. Maggiolini M. Feraco E. Mari V. et al.Genomics. 2005; 85: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Some of the sirtuin longevity pathways involved in CR-mediated life-span extension, most notably those involving SIRT1, are tightly intertwined with those controlled by the metabolic sensor AMPK, which has been linked to longevity in multiple ways. Like the FOXOs, the role of AMPK in CR-induced longevity is still debated (Kenyon, 2010Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2010; 464: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar); however, it does seem to be important in several longevity pathways. Indeed, the beneficial effect of S6K1 deficiency on life span is thought to involve AMPK activation (Selman et al., 2009Selman C. Tullet J.M. Wieser D. Irvine E. Lingard S.J. Choudhury A.I. Claret M. Al-Qassab H. Carmignac D. Ramadani F. et al.Science. 2009; 326: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK phosphorylates and thereby activates FOXO, possibly impacting longevity. Another mechanism by which AMPK may control longevity entails boosting NAD+ levels and activating SIRT1, which in turn deacetylates and activates targets, such as PGC-1α and FOXO1, leading to the induction of mitochondrial activity, respiratory metabolism, and oxidative stress responses (Canto et al., 2009Canto C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Feige J.N. Lagouge M. Noriega L. Milne J.C. Elliott P.J. Puigserver P. Auwerx J. Nature. 2009; 458: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar, Canto et al., 2010Canto C. Jiang L.Q. Deshmukh A.S. Mataki C. Coste A. Lagouge M. Zierath J.R. Auwerx J. Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 213-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A role for AMPK in longevity is also supported by the fact that metformin, an AMPK agonist that is used clinically for treating type 2 diabetes, extends life span in mice (Anisimov et al., 2008Anisimov V.N. Berstein L.M. Egormin P.A. Piskunova T.S. Popovich I.G. Zabezhinski M.A. Tyndyk M.L. Yurova M.V. Kovalenko I.G. Poroshina T.E. et al.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 2769-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, resveratrol, a drug that activates SIRT1 but not in a direct fashion (Beher et al., 2009Beher D. Wu J. Cumine S. Kim K.W. Lu S.C. Atangan L. Wang M. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2009; 74: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, Pacholec et al., 2010Pacholec M. Bleasdale J.E. Chrunyk B. Cunningham D. Flynn D. Garofalo R.S. Griffith D. Griffor M. Loulakis P. Pabst B. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 8340-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), achieves this effect by mildly inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, thereby inducing energy stress. The subsequent increase in the AMP/ATP ratio activates AMPK, increases NAD+ levels, and stimulates SIRT1, resulting in a compensatory induction of mitochondrial activity (Canto et al., 2009Canto C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Feige J.N. Lagouge M. Noriega L. Milne J.C. Elliott P.J. Puigserver P. Auwerx J. Nature. 2009; 458: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar, Canto et al., 2010Canto C.

Park S.J. Kang H. Yang S. Foretz M. McBurney M.W. Kim M.K. Viollet B. Chung J.H. Diabetes. 2010; 59: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), a process termed “mitohormesis.” In mice fed a high-calorie diet, resulting in a significantly decreased life span, resveratrol normalized life span, suggesting that the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway is involved (Baur et al., 2006Baur J.A. Pearson K.J. Price N.L. Jamieson H.A. Lerin C. Kalra A. Prabhu V.V. Allard J.S. Lopez-Lluch G. Lewis K. et al.Nature. 2006; 444: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). Although this suggests the involvement of AMPK/SIRT1 signaling in longevity, many aspects—such as the role of this signaling pathway and mitochondria in CR—remain to be investigated, especially in mammals. Many of the longevity genes identified to date have multiple effects on metabolism and appear to be intertwined in partly overlapping metabolic signaling networks that often affect the function of mitochondria (Figure 1). Supporting a potential role for mitochondria in longevity is the fact that activation of the transcriptional cofactor PGC-1α, which in mammals controls many aspects of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, protects against diseases associated with aging (Baur et al., 2006Baur J.A. Pearson K.J. Price N.L. Jamieson H.A. Lerin C. Kalra A. Prabhu V.V. Allard J.S. Lopez-Lluch G. Lewis K. et al.Nature. 2006; 444: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar, Lagouge et al., 2006Lagouge M. Argmann C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Meziane H. Lerin C. Daussin F. Messadeq N. Milne J. Lambert P. Elliott P. et al.Cell. 2006; 127: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). Definitive proof of PGC-1α's role in longevity is, however, still lacking. The impact of certain mutations in mitochondrial genes also deserves attention. Could it be that mutations that partially impair mitochondrial function, such as the oxidative phosphorylation or ubiquinone synthesis mutants of the worm (Dillin et al., 2002Dillin A. Hsu A.L. Arantes-Oliveira N. Lehrer-Graiwer J. Hsin H. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Kenyon C. Science. 2002; 298: 2398-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2003Lee S.S. Lee R.Y. Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Ruvkun G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), induce mitohormesis and longevity? The seemingly contradictory results regarding activation or inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism and increased longevity warn us that a simple genetic approach is not sufficient and that a more integrative physiological approach, including the thorough study of epigenetic and metabolic pathways, is warranted. The characterization of these pathways will undoubtedly be fertile ground for further research in the longevity field and will result in a clearer view of how mitochondria are involved in longevity and in aging-related diseases. Studies of genetically engineered animal models have proven useful for identifying longevity genes, but monogenic approaches have limitations. We also need methods that make it possible to study complex polygenic networks that interact with environmental factors to influence metabolic homeostasis and longevity. A hallmark of such complex traits is their graded and nearly continuous distribution throughout a population. Single gene variants are not associated with clear-cut Mendelian and modal patterns of inheritance. However, contributions of these variants can often be mapped to specific chromosomal regions that are called quantitative trait loci (QTLs) because they generate some fraction of the total variation of trait values in study populations. The study of complex traits has advanced rapidly and has relied on both family linkage studies and genome-wide association studies of large human cohorts. Corresponding studies in model organisms have often exploited test crosses (F2 intercrosses and backcrosses) and genetic reference panels, including sets of congenic and recombinant inbred strains. But how are these genetic approaches being applied to identify genes and molecular networks associated with longevity? Studies of human populations have led to the identification of a number of loci associated with longevity (de Magalhaes et al., 2009de Magalhaes J.P. Budovsky A. Lehmann G. Costa J. Li Y. Fraifeld V. Church G.M. Aging Cell. 2009; 8: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These studies generally entail an analysis of populations with exceptionally long life spans, such as centenarians. This approach is valuable, but studies of humans are still difficult because of the limited availability of subjects and potential confounding environmental factors. The most important limitation is of course that prospective and experimental perturbations are usually not feasible for testing causal models. Studies of rodents and other model organisms overcome some of these problems and allow us to add the experimental component while still accounting for genetic diversity. The most straightforward network approach uses model organisms in which a single gene is perturbed, either by genetic deletion or RNA interference, to map the compensatory mechanisms that result in a longevity trait. A more complicated method, but also more realistic in terms of modeling longevity, involves the characterization of QTLs in recombinant inbred lines. Recombinant inbred lines of D. melanogaster have been used extensively for the identification of QTLs for longevity. These studies typically use ∼100 recombinant inbred fly lines to measure life span and link variation to specific QTLs (Curtsinger and Khazaeli, 2002Curtsinger J.W. Khazaeli A.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A challenge has been to achieve sufficient resolution to define responsible gene variants. A recent study used extreme QTL (X-QTL) mapping to define determinants of mitochondrial function in yeast (Ehrenreich et al., 2010Ehrenreich I.M. Torabi N. Jia Y. Kent J. Martis S. Shapiro J.A. Gresham D. Caudy A.A. Kruglyak L. Nature. 2010; 464: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Even though this study did not assess yeast replicative or chronological life span, it marks an important step because X-QTL analysis allows mapping of not only major QTLs but also minor ones that might be missed using classical methods. An interesting alternative approach involves the analysis of modular networks (Xue et al., 2007Xue H. Xian B. Dong D. Xia K. Zhu S. Zhang Z. Hou L. Zhang Q. Zhang Y. Han J.D. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Combining genes in various modules (e.g., differentiation, proliferation, oxidative metabolism, and reductive metabolism) reveals that the aging process in the fly is characterized by a general shift from oxidative to reductive metabolism. CR clearly slows down this shift, thereby accounting for the longevity effect. Known aging genes are highly represented as “date hubs” between these modules, indicating that they serve as important regulators of aging (Xue et al., 2007Xue H. Xian B. Dong D. Xia K. Zhu S. Zhang Z. Hou L. Zhang Q. Zhang Y. Han J.D. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this unbiased network approach confirmed the importance of oxidative metabolism, implicated by monogenic studies. Another step forward will be the switch from relatively simple organisms, such as yeast and C. elegans, to more complex mammalian systems. Genetic and genomic analyses of large mouse families, generated by intercrossing long-lived and short-lived stock, will be useful for finding new longevity genes and networks. We recently used gene expression data for adipose tissue from four large mouse F2 crosses to identify candidate longevity networks. Following the strategy of using the “known” to uncover the “unknown,” we leveraged a seed set of 60 known longevity genes to extract a larger network, containing 742 tightly connected longevity genes (Argmann et al., 2009Argmann C. Dobrin R. Heikkinen S. Auburtin A. Pouilly L. Cock T.A. Koutnikova H. Zhu J. Schadt E.E. Auwerx J. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000752Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Among the top 20 genes tightly connected with known longevity genes was 4E-BP, a determinant of longevity in multiple species (Argmann et al., 2009Argmann C. Dobrin R. Heikkinen S. Auburtin A. Pouilly L. Cock T.A. Koutnikova H. Zhu J. Schadt E.E. Auwerx J. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000752Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Zid et al., 2009Zid B.M. Rogers A.N. Katewa S.D. Vargas M.A. Kolipinski M.C. Lu T.A. Benzer S. Kapahi P. Cell. 2009; 139: 149-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). When we applied pathway enrichment analysis to uncover relationships among the 742 genes contained within the longevity network, we detected enrichment in several gene ontologies with established links to aging, such as the complement and coagulation cascades (inflammation), insulin signaling, and the ubiquinone pathway (i.e., oxidative stress). Importantly, other unsuspected pathways were also highly enriched, including PPAR signaling—an ontology that actually ranked highest. Using an allelic series of PPARγ mutant mice, we validated a role for PPARγ in longevity (Argmann et al., 2009Argmann C. Dobrin R. Heikkinen S. Auburtin A. Pouilly L. Cock T.A. Koutnikova H. Zhu J. Schadt E.E. Auwerx J. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000752Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Heikkinen et al., 2009Heikkinen S. Argmann C. Feige J.N. Koutnikova H. Champy M.F. Dali-Youcef N. Schadt E.E. Laakso M. Auwerx J. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 88-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The analysis of mouse genetic reference populations is another powerful strategy to identify molecular networks that influence longevity. Genetic reference populations, such as the BXD and LXS mouse strains and the HXB rat strains, are stable families of inbred lines that can be used for large-scale collaborative phenotyping across multiple dimensions. These types of resources are ideal for studying the genetics of longevity because each genome is represented by an entire strain, making it possible to obtain far more accurate mortality data for each cohort of animals and for all genotypes under different experimental conditions and interventions. The strains within a genetic reference population collectively incorporate a level of genetic variation that can match or exceed that of human populations, making them an excellent vehicle with which to explore the generality of findings, the role of genetic background effects, and the translational relevance of gene variants to human populations and disease. Two large mouse genetic reference populations are now being used actively in longevity research—the BXD set generated by crossing C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, and the LXS set generated by crossing ILS/IbgTejJ and ISS/IbgTejJ. Using the original subset of BXD strains, several regions in the mouse genome have been linked to longevity (De Haan and Van Zant, 1999De Haan G. Van Zant G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 707-713PubMed Google Scholar, Gelman et al., 1988Gelman R. Watson A. Bronson R. Yunis E. Genetics. 1988; 118: 693-704PubMed Google Scholar), but small sample sizes and technical limitations have hampered the analysis. However, larger and much more powerful genetic and genomic datasets can now be exploited to reanalyze original longevity data for larger genetic reference populations and to extract more definitive and precise mapping results. Following identification of a QTL, candidate genes can be identified by association studies between mRNA expression and the trait, that is, life span. Expression of these genes can then also be cross-referenced with the expression of other genes, allowing a network to be assembled. Online tools, such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) analysis, can help in the identification of pathways linked to candidate genes. Finally, interesting candidate genes can be validated using longevity analyses in vivo. The advantage of this approach is that it uses natural variations in gene expression (like those found in normal human populations) instead of relying on the more artificial situation that occurs in gene knockout or knockdown experiments. It is imperative to realize that the directionality of the association cannot be identified using such strategies and that additional physiological evidence is always required to back up the genetic data and establish causality and directionality. This is especially relevant as various longevity pathways obtained in lower organisms proved difficult to phenocopy in mammals (Russell and Kahn, 2007Russell S.J. Kahn C.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and in other cases, mutations in the same gene resulted in opposite effects on life span (Argmann et al., 2009Argmann C. Dobrin R. Heikkinen S. Auburtin A. Pouilly L. Cock T.A. Koutnikova H. Zhu J. Schadt E.E. Auwerx J. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000752Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Heikkinen et al., 2009Heikkinen S. Argmann C. Feige J.N. Koutnikova H. Champy M.F. Dali-Youcef N. Schadt E.E. Laakso M. Auwerx J. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 88-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These discrepancies indicate that additional efforts should be put into the identification of the mechanisms underlying these differences, and attention should be paid not only to genetic but also to epigenetic factors that could affect metabolic networks of aging. Studies using single-gene gain or loss to alter gene activity in various organisms, ranging from yeast to mouse, have provided a wealth of information about specific genes, such as those encoding components of the insulin/IGF1 pathway, involved in longevity. Using such reductionist approaches, an emerging theme is the overrepresentation of metabolic pathways in general, and of mitochondrial activity in particular, as determinants of longevity. In this Essay, we have outlined the known metabolic pathways impacting longevity and we have integrated these pathways in a simplified network (Figure 1). Although it has long been appreciated that longevity is a complex process influenced by multiple gene variants, the development of complex genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics tools is now finally enabling a more thorough systems analysis of longevity networks. By using population studies in mouse and human, multiple genes and pathways have been recently linked to longevity and aging-related diseases. We have tried to give a flavor of what may soon emerge by using such synthetic approaches. In the near term, we foresee that the continued use of complex genetic strategies will gain importance in the longevity field and lead to the identification of tightly regulated longevity networks that govern intersecting metabolic pathways often affecting mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, it will prove increasingly important to extend these studies beyond a purely genetic level to include the evaluation of epigenetic factors. Such epigenetic factors impact processes ranging from DNA transcription (histone and DNA modifications), RNA (miRNAs), and protein stability and activity (posttranslational modifications), to metabolite levels (metabolite ligands or cofactors for proteins). The application of such holistic research strategies to elucidate the mechanisms by which CR impacts health span and life span in a variety of model organisms will probably be a major step forward in our understanding of the aging process. Finally, given the conserved role of mitochondria across species in the determination of longevity, obtaining insights into the complex and multifactorial regulation of metabolic flexibility may in fact hold the key to unlock the metabolic underpinnings of aging. The importance of metabolic flexibility for longevity is perhaps best illustrated by the universal association of a shift from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism in CR or endurance exercise, conditions that improve health span, whereas the converse switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism occurs when health span is compromised, such as in cancer or ischemia. It goes without saying that identifying the crucial nodes of these metabolic longevity networks might translate into the development of targeted preventative and therapeutic strategies to improve health span, a goal since the quest of Ponce de Leon to find the fountain of youth.

We previously characterized the defective gene in moonshine (mon), a mutant with a profound anemia and embryonic lethality (Ransom et al., 1996Ransom D.G. Haffter P. Odenthal J. Brownlie A.

The primitive erythroid lineage is normally specified in mon mutants but rapidly lost in developing embryos. Rare adult mon survivors (∼1/500) are extremely anemic, suggesting an essential function of tif1γ in definitive erythropoiesis as well (Ransom et al., 2004Ransom D.G. Bahary N. Niss K. Traver D.

The four members in TIF1 family, TIF1α, β, γ, and δ, are nuclear proteins composed of multiple evolutionarily conserved domains implicated in protein-protein interaction and chromatin association, including an N-terminal RBCC or TRIM domain, and the C-terminal PHD finger and bromodomain (Khetchoumian et al., 2004Khetchoumian K.

He et al. found that TIF1γ mediates TGFβ signaling by interacting with phosphorylated Smad2/3 (He et al., 2006He W. Dorn D.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Moore M.A. Massague J.

Studies on transcription elongation have shown that both negative and positive factors regulate elongation. Negative elongation factors DSIF (DRB Sensitivity Inducing Factor) and NELF (Negative Elongation Factor) stall Pol II at the proximal promoter (Wu et al., 2003Wu C.H. Yamaguchi Y. Benjamin L.R.

The PAF (Pol II Associated Factor) complex associates with the elongating Pol II and recruits enzymes for histone 2B ubiquitination (Pokholok et al., 2002Pokholok D.K. Hannett N.M. Young R.A.

The histone chaperone FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex is required for nucleosome assembly during Pol II elongation and also facilitates the recruitment of p-TEFb (Saunders et al., 2003Saunders A.

Sawado et al. found that the locus control region (LCR) of murine β-globin gene regulates the transition from the transcription initiation to elongation (Sawado et al., 2003Sawado T. Halow J. Bender M.A. Groudine M. The beta-globin locus control region (LCR) functions primarily by enhancing the transition from transcription initiation to elongation.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A study from Elagib et al. suggested an involvement of p-TEFb in megakaryocyte differentiation (Elagib et al., 2008Elagib K.E. Mihaylov I.S. Delehanty L.L. Bullock G.C. Ouma K.D. Caronia J.F.

In an effort to understand the role of TIF1γ in regulating erythropoiesis, we undertook a genetic modifier screen to look for suppressor mutants that could bypass TIF1γ and rescue the erythroid defect in mon mutants. One suppressor mutant, sunrise, has a mutation in cdc73 gene, which encodes a subunit of the elongation factor PAF. Genetic studies revealed a functional antagonism between TIF1γ and PAF/DSIF elongation factors in regulating erythroid gene expression. Biochemical studies in human cells demonstrated a direct link between TIF1γ and the transcription elongation machinery, and supported a model in which TIF1γ couples the blood-specific transcriptional complex with Pol II elongation machinery to promote the transcription elongation of erythroid genes by counteracting Pol II pausing. Our study illustrates a critical developmental checkpoint in which cell-specific transcription factors interacts with the elongation machinery to regulate cell fate. In order to identify genetic pathways interacting with TIF1γ during hematopoiesis, we conducted a genetic modifier screen to identify suppressor mutants that rescue the blood defect in mon embryos. The vast majority of mon homozygous fish die at approximately 7 to 10 days post fertilization (dpf), making it difficult to perform a genetic screen. Therefore, we created a viable mon homozygous line using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene (Figure 1A ). This 168 kb zebrafish BAC clone contains the entire tif1γ gene locus. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker driven by the β-actin promoter was recombined onto the backbone of BAC. After establishing stable transgenic lines, we confirmed that a single copy of the transgene could fully rescue mon homozygous fish to adulthood with normal blood development. Using this transgenic line, we undertook a haploid screen to identify suppressor mutants (Figure 1B). ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) mutagenesis was performed on males that were homozygous for mon and carried one copy of the transgene (mon; Tg{Tif1γ+; βactin:GFP}/+). F1 females were used to produce haploid embryos that were subjected to double in situ hybridization for GFP and βe3 globin at 22 hr post fertilization (hpf). During the screen, most F1 females did not carry suppressor mutations and gave rise to embryo clutches that contain only double-positive (GFP+; βe3+) and double-negative (GFP-; βe3-) embryos. If a female carried a suppressor mutation that could restore βe3 globin expression in the absence of tif1γ transgene, it would give rise to double-mutant embryos (mon; sup) that were GFP negative but globin positive (GFP-; βe3+). This female would be outcrossed to recover mutations in suppressor genes. Using this strategy, we screened about 800 haploid genomes and identified two recessive suppressor mutants. One of the mutants is named sunrise (sun), which is an embryonic lethal mutant with distinctive morphologic phenotypes (Figure 1C). As shown in Figure 1D, the sun mutant by itself has normal βe3 globin expression at 22 hpf but greatly restores βe3 expression in mon mutants. Benzidine staining confirmed that hemoglobin production was also partially rescued in mon; sun double mutants (Figure S1 available online). By positional cloning we mapped the sun gene to chromosome 2 between microsatellite makers z19387 and z13475 (Figure 2A ). This region contains a gene named cdc73, which is a subunit of the PAF complex. We noticed that the morphology of the sun mutant is very similar to the rtf1−/− mutant (Figure 2B), another subunit in the PAF complex, including severely reduced body melanocytes, small ears, impaired blood circulation, and profound pericardial edema (Akanuma et al., 2007Akanuma T. Koshida S. Kawamura A. Kishimoto Y. Takada S. Paf1 complex homologues are required for Notch-regulated transcription during somite segmentation.EMBO Reports. 2007; 8: 858-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the cdc73 gene in the sun mutant identified a C to T transition at +1507 in the coding region that leads to a premature stop codon after amino acid 502 (Figure 2C). This mutation is predicted to cause a truncated protein missing the last 19 amino acids that are highly conserved from Drosophila to human (Figure 2D). The western blot showed a complete loss of CDC73 protein in sun mutants (Figure 2E), indicating that the truncated protein is unstable and sun is a null mutant of cdc73. We further confirmed that injection of wild-type cdc73 mRNA completely rescued sun mutants (Figure 2B), whereas an antisense morpholino of cdc73 not only phenocopied the sun mutant (data not shown), but effectively rescued βe3 expression in mon embryos (Figure 2F). In contrast, a control morpholino with five base-pair mismatches failed to rescue mon. These results demonstrate that the defective gene in the sun mutant is cdc73. CDC73 is a component of the PAF complex that also contains PAF1, RTF1, LEO1, and CTR9 (Mueller and Jaehning, 2002Mueller C.L. Jaehning J.A. Ctr9, Rtf1, and Leo1 are components of the Paf1/RNA polymerase II complex.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To test if other PAF components have similar rescue activity, antisense morpholinos targeting paf1 or ctr9 were injected into mon embryos. Knocking down these PAF subunits caused a sun-like morphological phenotype (data not shown), and rescued βe3 expression in mon (Figure 3A , iv and v). The rtf1−/− genetic mutant also rescued globin expression in mon (Figure 3A, iii). These data suggest that TIF1γ antagonizes the whole PAF complex during blood development. We next examined the gene expression profiles in tif1γ- and cdc73-deficient cells. To focus on blood-specific targets, we used gata1:GFP transgenic fish, in which all erythroid cells are labeled with GFP and therefore can be isolated by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) (Long et al., 1997Long Q. Meng A. Wang H. Jessen J.R. Farrell M.J. Lin S. GATA-1 expression pattern can be recapitulated in living transgenic zebrafish using GFP reporter gene.Development. 1997; 124: 4105-4111PubMed Google Scholar). Morpholinos targeted to tif1γ or cdc73 were injected into gata1:GFP embryos. GFP+ cells were isolated at the 12 somite stage (ss) for RNA extraction (Figure 3B). Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed downregulation of several blood-specific genes in tif1γ-deficient cells, but their expression was greatly restored by knocking down cdc73 simultaneously (Figure 3C). Microarray analyses revealed that among the 243 erythroid-signature genes that are enriched in gata1:GFP+ cells (L.Z. and G. Weber, unpublished data), many genes were oppositely regulated by tif1γ and cdc73, and the deregulated genes in tif1γ-deficient cells are largely restored in double-knockdown cells (Figure 3D). Notably, one of the genes regulated by tif1γ is scl, the master regulator of hematopoiesis. We therefore tested if overexpression of scl could rescue mon. Injection of scl mRNA clearly increased blood formation in wild-type embryos but does little in mon mutants (Figure S2A ), suggesting a more direct and broad function of tif1γ in erythropoiesis. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we also tested other tissue-specific genes by selecting five to eight representative genes for each tissue. The tissues we tested include myeloid cells, muscle, heart, and kidney. We did not see obvious antagonistic regulation of these genes by tif1γ and cdc73 (data not shown). Among the oppositely regulated genes, genome-wide gene ontology analysis revealed the enrichment of several pathways, including BMP signaling pathway and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway (Figure S2B). The PAF complex is involved in multiple steps during transcription, including histone 2B ubiquitination, transcription elongation, and mRNA 3′ end processing and polyadenylation (Penheiter et al., 2005Penheiter K.L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34739-34742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To determine which function of PAF contributes to the mon-rescuing effect, we used morpholinos to knock down factors known to interact with PAF during these processes. Rad6 is an E2 ligase for H2B ubiquitination and known to be recruited by PAF. We found that knockdown of the zebrafish Rad6 homologs Rad6A and Rad6B failed to rescue globin expression in mon (Figure 4A ). Similarly, knockdown of multiple factors essential for 3′ RNA processing, including CPSF2, CPSF3, and CstF2, also failed to rescue mon (Figure 4A). Western-blot analysis demonstrated near-complete knockdown of these proteins (Figure S3). These results suggest pathways other than H2B ubiquitination and 3′ RNA processing are likely to be responsible for rescuing mon upon losing PAF function.Figure S3The Efficiency of Morpholino Knockdowns, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Knockdown of CPSF and CstF factors cause similar morphology at 48 hpf.(B) The western blots showing knockdown efficiency of CPSF factors and Rad6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Knockdown of CPSF and CstF factors cause similar morphology at 48 hpf. (B) The western blots showing knockdown efficiency of CPSF factors and Rad6. PAF is thought to promote transcription by positively regulating elongation, yet our results suggested a negative role of PAF on blood gene expression. To test if loss of tif1γ or cdc73 can potentially affect transcription elongation of blood genes including gata1, scl, βe3, and a red-cell membrane protein epb4.1, we assayed blood gene transcripts near the 5′ or 3′ end using quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 4B). We detected a similar level of 5′ ends of transcripts in wild-type and tif1γ-deficient cells. In contrast, the PCR products from the 3′ ends of blood transcripts were dramatically decreased in tif1γ-deficient cells (Figure 4B). This result could be explained by inefficient Pol II elongation leading to a reduced level of full-length transcripts, although this approach mainly measures the steady-state levels of RNA that are probably released from Pol II. Surprisingly, depletion of cdc73 greatly restored the level of the 3′ ends of blood transcripts (Figure 4B), suggesting a negative role of PAF in producing full-length blood transcripts. To determine if TIF1γ and CDC73 exert their antagonistic roles by directly binding to blood genes, we performed a small-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Chip analysis for TIF1γ and CDC73 in K562 human erythroleukemia cells using the Genome Tiling 2.0R Array C. We identified 313 genes bound by TIF1γ and 233 genes bound by CDC73, respectively (Figure 4C). In total, 129 genes are bound by TIF1γ and CDC73, including several blood-specific genes: gata1, gata2, runx1, and alas2 (Figure 4C and data not shown). We further confirmed the binding of TIF1γ and CDC73 on these blood genes in proerythroblasts differentiated from primary human CD34+ cells (Figure 4D). Furthermore, knocking down TIF1γ by shRNA in CD34+ cells reduced the expression of multiple erythroid genes and severely blocked erythroid differentiation in vitro (Figure 4E). Two different TIF1γ-shRNA constructs showed similar effects and both efficiently knock down TIF1γ at both the protein level and the mRNA level (Figure 4E and data not shown). These results demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved function of TIF1γ in eryrthropoiesis. As an elongation factor, PAF has been shown to functionally interact with other elongation factors, including DSIF, FACT, and p-TEFb (Qiu et al., 2006Qiu H. Hu C. Wong C.M. Hinnebusch A.G. The Spt4p subunit of yeast DSIF stimulates association of the Paf1 complex with elongating RNA polymerase II.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Squazzo et al., 2002Squazzo S.L. Costa P.J. Lindstrom D.L. Kumer K.E. Simic R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Arndt K.M. Hartzog G.A. The Paf1 complex physically and functionally associates with transcription elongation factors in vivo.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1764-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To test if these factors also play specific roles in hematopoiesis, we knocked down these PAF-associated elongation factors in zebrafish embryos by morpholinos. Knockdown of FACT subunits SPT16 and SSRP1 diminished globin expression at 22 hpf (Figure 5A , ii), suggesting that FACT is required for primitive erythropoiesis. In contrast to a previous study showing that p-TEFb is not required for primitive hematopoiesis (Meier et al., 2006Meier N. Krpic S. Rodriguez P. Strouboulis J. Monti M. Krijgsveld J. Gering M. Patient R. Hostert A. Grosveld F. Novel binding partners of Ldb1 are required for haematopoietic development.Development. 2006; 133: 4913-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we found that knockdown of CDK9, the kinase subunit in p-TEFb, disrupted primitive erythropoiesis (Figure 5A, iii). In addition, treating embryos with flavopiridol, a chemical inhibitor of CDK9 (Chao and Price, 2001Chao S.H. Price D.H. Flavopiridol inactivates P-TEFb and blocks most RNA polymerase II transcription in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31793-31799Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), also inhibited blood formation (Figure 5A, iv) but left other mesoderm tissues relatively intact (Figure S4). Moreover, flavopiridol treatment also blocked erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ cells, as shown by benzidine staining in Figure 5B. Taken together, these results establish that elongation factors FACT and p-TEFb positively regulate erythropoiesis.Figure S4Flavopiridol Treatment Does Not Affect Mesoderm Genes myoD and pax2.1, Related to Figure 5Show full captionIn situ hybridization was performed at 20 hpf.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In situ hybridization was performed at 20 hpf. In contrast to FACT and p-TEFb, morpholino knockdown of DSIF subunit SPT5 phenocopied the morphology of sun mutants (Figure 5C), suggesting that DSIF and PAF have similar functions in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, depletion of spt5 effectively rescued βe3 expression in mon (Figure 5D, ii). To verify the morpholino results, we crossed mon into the spt5s30 mutant that harbors a deletion of the spt5 gene (Keegan et al., 2002Keegan B.R. Feldman J.L. Lee D.H. Koos D.S. Ho R.K. Stainier D.Y. Yelon D. The elongation factors Pandora/Spt6 and Foggy/Spt5 promote transcription in the zebrafish embryo.Development. 2002; 129: 1623-1632PubMed Google Scholar). Blood was also rescued in mon; spt5s30 double mutants (Figure 5D, iii). These results suggest that both DSIF and PAF play negative roles on blood gene expression and TIF1γ is required to antagonize their function. DSIF has been shown to play dual roles during transcription elongation (Krishnan et al., 2008Krishnan K. Salomonis N. Guo S.

Taking stock of key numbers in cell and molecular biology enables back-of-the-envelope calculations that test and sharpen our understanding of cellular processes. Further, such calculations provide a quantitative context for the torrent of data from new experimental techniques. However, such useful numbers are scattered in the vast biological literature in a way that often leads to a frustrating literature-mining ordeal. Here, we have collected a set of basic numbers in biology that we find extremely useful for obtaining an order of magnitude feel for the molecular processes in cells. Several examples (see below) show how to combine these numbers to think about biological questions. The values should be considered rules of thumb rather than definitive values as variety is the spice of life and variability is ever present in biology.

https://openalex.org/W2074845792,"Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that are essential for normal development and are often dysregulated in cancers. The molecular mechanisms that cause their misregulation in cancers are largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which the Six1 homeobox protein, which has a crucial role during development, is frequently deregulated in several poor outcome, aggressive, metastatic adult human cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pediatric malignancies such as rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms’ tumor. Our results reveal that miRNA-185 translationally represses Six1 by binding to its 3′-untranslated region. Analyses of ovarian cancers, pediatric renal tumors and multiple breast cancer cell lines showed decreased miR-185 expression, paralleling an increase in Six1 levels. Further investigation revealed that miR-185 impedes anchorage-independent growth and cell migration, in addition to suppressing tumor growth in vivo, implicating it to be a potent tumor suppressor. Our results indicate that miR-185 mediates its tumor suppressor function by regulating cell-cycle proteins and Six1 transcriptional targets c-myc and cyclin A1. Furthermore, we show that miR-185 sensitizes Six1-overexpressing resistant cancer cells to apoptosis in general and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis in particular. Together, our findings suggest that the altered expression of the novel tumor suppressor miR-185 may be one of the central events that leads to dysregulation of oncogenic protein Six1 in human cancers."

The simulation results show that the overall conformation of CALB is stable in the organic solvents. In the nonpolar solvents, the conformation of the active site keeps stable, whereas in the polar solvents, the solvent molecules reach into the active site and interact intensively with the active site. This interaction destroys the hydrogen bonding between Ser<sup>105</sup> and His<sup>224</sup>. In the solvents, the activation energy of CALB and that of the active site region were further simulated by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulation.

https://openalex.org/W2066835384,"Candida albicans is a major fungal pathogen that causes serious systemic and mucosal infections in immunocompromised individuals. In yeast, histone H3 Lys56 acetylation (H3K56ac) is an abundant modification regulated by enzymes that have fungal-specific properties, making them appealing targets for antifungal therapy. Here we demonstrate that H3K56ac in C. albicans is regulated by the RTT109 and HST3 genes, which respectively encode the H3K56 acetyltransferase (Rtt109p) and deacetylase (Hst3p). We show that reduced levels of H3K56ac sensitize C. albicans to genotoxic and antifungal agents. Inhibition of Hst3p activity by conditional gene repression or nicotinamide treatment results in a loss of cell viability associated with abnormal filamentous growth, histone degradation and gross aberrations in DNA staining. We show that genetic or pharmacological alterations in H3K56ac levels reduce virulence in a mouse model of C. albicans infection. Our results demonstrate that modulation of H3K56ac is a unique strategy for treatment of C. albicans and, possibly, other fungal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2014216299,"GroEL and GroES form a chaperonin nano-cage for single protein molecules to fold in isolation. The folding properties that render a protein chaperonin dependent are not yet understood. Here, we address this question using a double mutant of the maltose-binding protein DM-MBP as a substrate. Upon spontaneous refolding, DM-MBP populates a kinetically trapped intermediate that is collapsed but structurally disordered. Introducing two long-range disulfide bonds into DM-MBP reduces the entropic folding barrier of this intermediate and strongly accelerates native state formation. Strikingly, steric confinement of the protein in the chaperonin cage mimics the kinetic effect of constraining disulfides on folding, in a manner mediated by negative charge clusters in the cage wall. These findings suggest that chaperonin dependence correlates with the tendency of proteins to populate entropically stabilized folding intermediates. The capacity to rescue proteins from such folding traps may explain the uniquely essential role of chaperonin cages within the cellular chaperone network."

In this study we examined the cellular effects and molecular mechanism of the arrestin family member, ARRDC3, a gene preferentially lost in a subset of breast cancers. Oncomine data revealed that the expression of ARRDC3 decreases with tumor grade, metastases and recurrences. ARRDC3 overexpression represses cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, growth in soft agar and in vivo tumorigenicity, whereas downregulation of ARRCD3 has the opposite effects. Mechanistic studies showed that ARRDC3 functions in a novel regulatory pathway that controls the cell surface adhesion molecule, β-4 integrin (ITGβ4), a protein associated with aggressive tumor behavior. Our data indicates ARRDC3 directly binds to a phosphorylated form of ITGβ4 leading to its internalization, ubiquitination and ultimate degradation. The results identify the ARRCD3-ITGβ4 pathway as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer and show the importance of connecting genetic arrays with mechanistic studies in the search for new treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1533971869,"Synapse-to-nucleus signaling is critical for synaptic development and plasticity. In Drosophila, the ligand Wingless causes the C terminus of its Frizzled2 receptor (Fz2-C) to be cleaved and translocated from the postsynaptic density to nuclei. The mechanism of nuclear import is unknown and the developmental consequences of this translocation are uncertain. We found that Fz2-C localization to muscle nuclei required the nuclear import factors Importin-beta11 and Importin-alpha2 and that this pathway promoted the postsynaptic development of the subsynaptic reticulum (SSR), an elaboration of the postsynaptic plasma membrane. importin-beta11 (imp-beta11) and dfz2 mutants had less SSR, and some boutons lacked the postsynaptic marker Discs Large. These developmental defects in imp-beta11 mutants could be overcome by expression of Fz2-C fused to a nuclear localization sequence that can bypass Importin-beta11. Thus, Wnt-activated growth of the postsynaptic membrane is mediated by the synapse-to-nucleus translocation and active nuclear import of Fz2-C via a selective Importin-beta11/alpha2 pathway."

Profiling of cognate Hh pathway members revealed reduced expression of two key Hh signaling effectors, Smoothened (SMOH) and GLI, in CLL cells, whereas transcription levels of other investigated members resembled normal B-lymphocyte levels. Examining the functional role of SMOH and GLI in cell survival, we found that CLL cells were hardly sensitive toward specific SMOH inhibition, but showed an unspecific decline in cell viability in response to high concentrations of the SMOH antagonist cyclopamine. In contrast, treatment with the novel GLI antagonist GANT61 reduced expression of the target gene Patched and preferentially decreased the viability of malignant cells. Specific RNA interference knockdown experiments in a CLL-derived cell line confirmed the autonomous role of GLI in malignant cell survival. GANT61-induced apoptosis in primary leukemic cells was partly attenuated by protective stromal cells, but not soluble sonic hedgehog ligand. In summary, our data show a downregulation of the classical Hh pathway in CLL and suggest an intrinsic SMOH-independent role of GLI in the ex vivo survival of CLL cells."

Clinically HER4 expression is extinguished during breast tumorigenesis supporting a tumor suppressor function for HER4, however, a molecular mechanism to explain the selective loss of HER4 expression has remained elusive. Epigenetic mechanisms, for example, aberrant gene promoter hypermethylation, have been shown to ablate tumor suppressor gene expression in breast carcinomas. We identified a CpG island within the HER4 promoter and show by pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA an inverse correlation between HER4 expression and the extent of promoter methylation. Treatment of the HER4-negative BT20 cell line with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC)-enhanced HER4 expression, confirming a role for DNA methylation in suppressed HER4 expression. DAC treatment to reactive HER4 expression in combination with the HER4 ligand heregulin-β1 (HRG) resulted in apoptosis of BT20 cells providing a novel therapeutic strategy for triple-negative tumors. The BT20 cells were rescued from apoptosis when preincubated with HER4 small interfering RNA, thereby confirming a role for HER4 in DAC/HRG-induced apoptosis. We verified HER4 promoter methylation in primary breast carcinomas and detected a significant increase in HER4 promoter methylation in HER4-negative breast tumors (P<0.001). Furthermore, increased levels of HER4 promoter methylation were significantly associated with worse patient prognosis (P=0.0234).

A conspicuous finding was that dephosphorylation of nuclear Akt was induced within minutes and that this effect was associated with inhibited cell proliferation. Extracellular ATP also induced nuclear pAkt depletion, and several lines of evidence indicated that the rapid pAkt depletion was mediated by the purinergic receptor P2X7 (7Mistafa O. Stenius U.

A family of protein phosphatases, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP), was identified as a phosphatase for Akt (10Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Two isoforms, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, have been shown to dephosphorylate distinct Akt isoforms, at one (Ser473) of two phosphorylation sites required for activation (11Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). This dephosphorylation is regulated by the immunophilin FKBP51 (FK506-binding protein 51), which acts as scaffolding protein for Akt and PHLPP (12Pei H. Li L. Fridley B.L. Jenkins G.D. Kalari K.R. Lingle W. Petersen G. Lou Z. Wang L. Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 259-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Other phosphatases shown to dephosphorylate Akt are calcineurin (13Ni Y.G. Wang N. Cao D.J. Sachan N. Morris D.J. Gerard R.D. Kuro-O M. Rothermel B.A. Hill J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20517-20522Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and PP2A (14Andjelković M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Earlier studies show that calcineurin also interacts with FKBP51 (15Li T.K. Baksh S. Cristillo A.D. Bierer B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 460-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Yet another regulator of nuclear Akt is the lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten). PTEN targets phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, a product of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The PTEN regulation is complex, involving phosphorylations, ubiquitinations, and protein complex formation (16Rabinovsky R. Pochanard P. McNear C. Brachmann S.M. Duke-Cohan J.S. Garraway L.A. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 5377-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although questioned (17Fouladkou F. Landry T. Kawabe H. Neeb A. Lu C. Brose N. Stambolic V. Rotin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8585-8590Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), recent data indicate that monoubiquitination of PTEN by the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-1 mediates its nuclear localization. This effect was correlated with tumor suppression and inhibition of nuclear pAkt (18Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Jiang X. Cell. 2007; 128: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). p21cip1 is one of several nuclear targets for Akt (19Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism underlying the rapid depletion of nuclear pAkt. We report that ATP or pharmacologically relevant concentrations of statins activate PHLPP1 and 2, calcineurin, PP2A, and PTEN within minutes. We also show that activation of these phosphatases is associated with nuclear translocation of PCNA and its binding to p21cip1 and suggest that these signaling events regulate the cell cycle. Non-small cell lung cancer cells, A549, were purchased from ATCC. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), with 10% inactivated calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Serum-starved cells were cultured with medium supplemented with 0.1% serum for 24 h. The androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma LNCaP cells were purchased from ATCC. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Atorvastatin was provided by Pfizer (New York, NY). BzATP, insulin, cycloheximide, FK-506 monohydrate, adenosine 5′-triphosphatase (porcine cerebral cortex), adenosine 5′-triphosphate disodium salt, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (MG132), and KN-62 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. BAPTA-AM was provided by Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Okadaic acid sodium salt and leptomycin B were provided by Calbiochem. The final concentration of DMSO added to the cells was <0.4%. No effect of DMSO was observed. Western blotting was performed as described previously (6Pääjärvi G. Roudier E. Crisby M. Högberg J. Stenius U. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and thereafter blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Some samples were subfractionated. The protein bands were probed using antibodies against Akt-1, Akt phosphorylated at residue Ser473 or Thr308, α-tubulin, PTEN, NEDD4-1, and Cdk2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); α-calcineurin and β-calcineurin from Sigma-Aldrich; PTEN from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); and PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 from Bethyl Laboratories Inc. (Montgomery, TX). Cyclin D1 was purchased from Calbiochem. Proteins were visualized with the ECL procedure (Amersham Biosciences). The Western blotting results were analyzed with NIH Image 1.62 software. Cells were transfected with PHLPP, PTEN, or NEDD4-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for 72 h according to the TranIT-TKO protocol from the manufacturer (Mirus, Madison, WI) (Lipofectin). Control siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Cells were transfected with pSG5L or pSG5L-HA-PTEN (Addgene) for 24 h according to the Lipofectamine 2000 protocol (Mirus). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. After fixation, the cells were stained with antibodies anti-PTEN (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), pAkt Thr308, PCNA, ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), α-calcineurin, β-calcineurin (Sigma-Aldrich), and PHLPP1 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.). After incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, secondary antibody conjugated with FITC or Texas Red were applied (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). No staining was detected when the primary antibodies were omitted. The staining intensity was analyzed with NIH Image 1.62 software. The proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Duolink detection kit with PLA PLUS and MINUS probes for mouse and rabbit (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Immunoprecipitation was performed by using FKBP51 (BD Biosciences), PTEN, (total Akt), Akt-1, p21cip1, PCNA, and pAkt Ser473 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), α-calcineurin (Sigma-Aldrich), PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., and protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in IPB-7. The cell lysates were incubated for 1 h with antibodies and then with protein A/G PLUS-agarose for 24 h at 4 °C. Statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t test. The data were presented as mean ± S.D. Experiments were performed at least three times with different batches of cells. Results were considered to be statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05. We have previously shown that insulin-induced nuclear pAkt levels were decreased within 1 min after the addition of ATP or atorvastatin, whereas the total Akt levels were not affected (8Mistafa O. Högberg J. Stenius U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This effect was associated with altered phosphorylations of downstream targets of pAkt, including GSK-3β and cyclin D1 (7Mistafa O. Stenius U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the mechanism behind this effect. PHLPP has been shown to dephosphorylate pAkt (10Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), and studies of colon and pancreatic cancers indicate a tumor suppressor function of this protein (24Liu J. Weiss H.L. Rychahou P. Jackson L.N. Evers B.M. Gao T. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 994-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Both PHLPP isoforms (PHLPP1 and -2) are present in the cytosolic, nuclear, and membrane fractions of the cell (11Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, atorvastatin induced a nuclear localization of PHLPP1 within 3 min of statin treatment in insulin-stimulated cells. A similar effect was found for PHLPP2 (data not shown). The total protein levels of PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 were not affected (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 1Atorvastatin and BzATP induce nuclear localization of PHLPP and binding to Akt. In A–D, A549 cells were treated with insulin (1 μm for 15 min) and thereafter with atorvastatin (1 μm for 1–5 min) as indicated. In E, cells were transfected with siRNA against PHLPP (50 nm) for 72 h and thereafter treated with insulin (1 μg/ml for 15 min) and atorvastatin (1 μm for 5 min). In F, cells were treated with KN-62 (100 nm for 10 min) and thereafter with BzATP or ATP (100 μm for 1–5 min) as indicated. In A and F, cells were stained for PHLPP1, and in E, they were stained for pAkt Thr308. In B, samples were then analyzed by Western blotting, employing antibodies for PHLPP1 and PHLPP2. Cdk2 was used as a loading control. In C, protein-protein interactions between Akt and PHLPP1 were studied employing PLA. Purple dots indicate proximity between cellular bound antibodies. The purple dots were counted using MATLAB, and the distribution of PHLPP1/AKT PLA signals between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is shown in insulin-treated (n = 50) or insulin plus atorvastatin-treated cells (n = 50) (each square represents a single cell). In D, lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) using an Akt1 antibody and analyzed employing antibodies for PHLPP1 or PHLPP2. Total lysates were analyzed for Cdk2 (loading control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the binding of PHLPP to Akt, described previously (11Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), PLA was performed to image protein-protein interaction between Akt and PHLPP. PLA analysis showed a binding between Akt and PHLPP1, as seen by the appearance of purple stained dots in Fig. 1C. This event was coordinated with the dephosphorylation. At 5 min, the binding between PHLPP1 and Akt returned to background levels. The visualization of individual protein complexes as distinct fluorescent spots allows computer-assisted image analysis. As shown in the PLA diagram (Fig. 1C, each square in the diagram represents a single cell), the dots representing PHLPP1/Akt-binding proteins tended to be localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Atorvastatin treatment alone induced PHLPP1-Akt interaction although not to the same extent as in insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 1C). To further investigate interactions between the proteins, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 with anti-Akt1 antibody. Western blot analyses of the samples show increased binding between PHLPP2 and Akt1 at 3 and 4 min after statin treatment (Fig. 1D) and no binding between PHLPP1 and Akt1. This was expected because PHLPP2 dephosphorylates Akt1 and Akt3, and PHLPP1 dephosphorylates Akt2 and Akt3 (11Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The role of PHLPP for depletion of pAkt was also investigated by using siRNA for PHLPP. Silencing PHLPP1 and -2 inhibited the statin-induced depletion of nuclear pAkt (Fig. 1E), suggesting that PHLPP was needed for dephosphorylation of insulin-induced nuclear pAkt. Also shown in Fig. 1E is that silencing PHLPP resulted in phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, detected by Western blotting. Furthermore, pAkt Thr308 accumulated in the nucleus. We have previously shown that statins regulate nuclear pAkt via the P2X7 purinergic receptor in epithelial cells (8Mistafa O. Högberg J. Stenius U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1F, a 1-min incubation with the P2X7 agonist BzATP induced nuclear localization of PHLPP1. A similar effect was induced by the natural agonist for P2X receptors ATP (Fig. 1F). The results in Fig. 1F also show that ATP-induced nuclear localization of PHLPP1 was inhibited by the P2X7 receptor antagonist, KN-62. These data indicate that this statin- and ATP-induced nuclear localization of PHLPP1 was mediated by P2X7. FKBP51 acts as a scaffolding protein for PHLPP and Akt (12Pei H. Li L. Fridley B.L. Jenkins G.D. Kalari K.R. Lingle W. Petersen G. Lou Z. Wang L. Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 259-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The binding between these proteins was studied here in immunoprecipitation experiments. Fig. 2A shows an increased binding between FKBP51 and pAkt when cells were stimulated with insulin. This binding was decreased at 5 min after the addition of statin. Next, we tested an inhibitor of FKBP51, FK506. We found that preincubation with FK506 completely prevented the effect of atorvastatin on nuclear pAkt Thr308 (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that FKBP51 is critical for the regulation of nuclear Akt in A549 cells.FIGURE 2FK506 inhibits statin-induced depletion of pAkt and nuclear localization of calcineurin. In A–C, cells were treated with FK 506 (20 μm) prior to the addition of insulin (1 μg/ml for 15 min) and thereafter with atorvastatin (1 μm for 3 min) or ATP. In B, cells were stained for pAkt Thr308, and in C, they were stained for α or β-calcineurin. In A, cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) using FKBP51 antibody and analyzed employing pAkt Ser473. In C, Western blotting, employing antibodies for α-calcineurin and β-calcineurin, was also used, and Cdk2 was the loading control. In D, cells were immunoprecipitated by using a α-calcineurin antibody. PHLPP2 and pAkt Ser473 antibodies were used for detection. Total lysates were analyzed for Cdk2. In E, cells were pretreated with BAPTA (2 μm for 15 min) followed by insulin (1 μg/ml for 15 min) and thereafter with atorvastatin (1 μm for 5 min). Cells were stained for pAkt Tyr308. In F, cells were pretreated with okadaic acid (100 nm) for 4 h followed by insulin (1 μg/ml for 15 min) and thereafter with atorvastatin (1 μm for 3 min). Cells were stained for pAkt Tyr308.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FKBP51 has also been shown to be regulated by calcineurin (15Li T.K. Baksh S. Cristillo A.D. Bierer B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 460-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is activated by Ca2+, and we have shown previously that atorvastatin induces increased Ca2+ levels in epithelial cells (8Mistafa O. Högberg J. Stenius U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Studies on myocardial myocytes also indicate that calcineurin can dephosphorylate Akt (25Park C.H. Kim Y.S. Kim Y.H. Choi M.Y. Yoo J.M. Kang S.S. Choi W.S. Cho G.J. Brain Res. 2008; 1234: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Teruel T. Hernandez R. Lorenzo M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2563-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated effects of statins and purins on calcineurin. We found that incubation of A549 cells with atorvastatin (1 μm) for 1–3 min increased nuclear levels of α- and β-calcineurin (Fig. 2C). This was induced without affecting total amounts of the proteins as indicated by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). Also shown in Fig. 2C is that atorvastatin-induced nuclear localization of calcineurin was inhibited by FK506. NFAT is a downstream target of calcineurin, and we found that NFAT was translocated to the nucleus by statin treatment, confirming that calcineurin was activated (data not shown). These experiments were also repeated with ATP or BzATP. Both purins mimicked the effects of statins (not shown). Immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2D) showed that after a 3-min incubation with atorvastatin, an increased binding of Akt and PHLPP was detected in lysates immunoprecipitated with a α-calcineurin antibody. There was also an increased binding between α-calcineurin and pAkt Ser473 (Fig. 2D). The use of the pAkt Ser473 or pAkt Thr308 antibodies in this experiment confirms the observations from our previous reports that both phosphospecific Akt antibodies gave the same results. The immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Fig. 2D support the results shown in Fig. 2, B and C. BAPTA-AM was used to block a previously shown (8Mistafa O. Högberg J. Stenius U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels. As shown in Fig. 2E, the atorvastatin-induced depletion of nuclear pAkt was completely abolished by BAPTA-AM. This supports a role of Ca2+ in this process. We also found that BAPTA-AM inhibited the statin-induced nuclear localization of PHLPP (data not shown). PP2A is a phosphatase that has been shown to dephosphorylate Akt at both Ser473 and Thr308 and that is regulated by Ca2+ (27Ahn J.H. Sung J.Y. McAvoy T. Nishi A. Janssens V. Goris J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9876-9881Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is inhibited by okadaic acid, and we found that okadaic acid prevented the statin-induced depletion of nuclear pAkt (Fig. 2F), indicating a role for PP2A in the depletion of nuclear pAkt. The lipid phosphatase PTEN is a major regulator of Akt phosphorylation. We found that in insulin-stimulated A549 cells, atorvastatin affected PTEN localization within a few minutes. As shown in Fig. 3A, atorvastatin decreased the cytoplasmic PTEN staining, but vesicle-like cytoplasmic compartments remained at 3 min. The nuclear PTEN staining increased (Fig. 3A). The earliest effects were seen at 1 min and peaked at 3 min. 4 or 5 min after the addition of atorvastatin, the PTEN staining was located close to the nuclear membrane, leaving the center of the nucleus unstained. It thus seemed that atorvastatin triggered a rapid translocation of PTEN to the nucleus, followed by an accumulation in a perinuclear compartment. The pattern of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of PTEN is consistent with previous reports (4Trotman L.C. Wang X. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Teruya-Feldstein J. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Carver B.S. Cordon-Cardo C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Chi S.G. Kim H.J. Misteli T. Jiang X. Pandolfi P.P.

BzATP and ATP induced similar effects (data not shown). In other experiments, we also replaced ATP by UTP. ATP activates both P2Y and P2X receptors, whereas UTP activates P2Y receptors only (29Burnstock G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). We found that UTP did not have any effect on PTEN (data not shown). In fractionation experiments and employing Western blots, we found that statin increased nuclear PTEN levels at 1 min (Fig. 3B). PTEN was thereafter decreased without a concomitant increase of PTEN in the cytoplasmic fraction. Fig. 3B also shows the densitometric analysis of three different experiments, confirming results shown in Fig. 3A. The purity of the cytoplasmic extract was confirmed by analyzing α-tubulin. Double immunofluorescence staining of pAkt and PTEN was performed to compare the localizations of these two antigens (Fig. 3C). In line with our earlier data (8Mistafa O. Högberg J. Stenius U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we observed that insulin-stimulated nuclear pAkt levels (green staining) significantly decreased after the addition of atorvastatin. Nuclear PTEN levels (red staining) were first increased by atorvastatin (as already shown in Fig. 3A) and then decreased. Fig. 3C also shows that the increased nuclear PTEN staining co-located with the pAkt staining at 1 min. At 3 min, the center of the nucleus was unstained, but a rim close to the nuclear membrane indicated co-localization (yellow) as well as separate PTEN staining. These and other data from additional time points are summarized in the diagram in Fig. 3C. Taken together, these data indicate a rapid translocation of PTEN with nuclear levels peaking even earlier than, for example, PHLPP and calcineurin. A causative association between PTEN and the previously described down-regulation of pAkt was indicated. To study an involvement of PTEN in the depletion of nuclear pAkt more in detail, PLA was performed. As seen by the appearance of purple-stained dots in Fig. 4A, atorvastatin induced a rapid interaction between pAkt Thr308 and PTEN. Most dots were centered on the nuclear membrane. As compared with the PLA picture produced by PHLPP/Akt antibodies (Fig. 1C), more dots were seen in the nucleus at 2 min. Replacing the pAkt Thr308 with an antibody against pAkt Ser473 did not markedly change the staining pattern (data not shown). This confirms the results shown in Fig. 3 and indicates that PTEN forms a complex with pAkt a few min after the addition of atorvastatin and that the complex is localized close to the nuclear membrane within 3 min. This nuclear membrane localization is decreased at 4 min, and the binding is reversed to background levels at 5 min. Atorvastatin alone also gave rise to pAkt-PTEN interactions, seen after 5 min (Fig. 4A), suggesting that insulin stimulation speeded up the PTEN and pAkt encounter. Fig. 4B shows the highest level of binding at 3 min after atorvastatin treatment. Fig. 4C shows the distribution (at 3 min) of spots in the cytoplasmic or the nuclear area. It can be seen that the distribution varied between single cells but that the nuclear loc"
https://openalex.org/W2055025159,"The O-antigen polymerase of gram-negative bacteria has been difficult to characterize. Herein we report the biochemical and functional characterization of the protein product (Wzy) of the gene annotated as the putative O-antigen polymerase, which is located in the O-antigen biosynthetic locus of Francisella tularensis. In silico analysis (homology searching, hydropathy plotting, and codon usage assessment) strongly suggested that Wzy is an O-antigen polymerase whose function is to catalyze the addition of newly synthesized O-antigen repeating units to a glycolipid consisting of lipid A, inner core polysaccharide, and one repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide (O-PS). To characterize the function of the Wzy protein, a non-polar deletion mutant of wzy was generated by allelic replacement, and the banding pattern of O-PS was observed by immunoblot analysis of whole-cell lysates obtained by SDS-PAGE and stained with an O-PS-specific monoclonal antibody. These immunoblot analyses showed that O-PS of the wzy mutant expresses only one repeating unit of O-antigen. Further biochemical characterization of the subcellular fractions of the wzy mutant demonstrated that (as is characteristic of O-antigen polymerase mutants) the low molecular weight O-antigen accumulates in the periplasm of the mutant. Site-directed mutagenesis based on protein homology and topology, which was carried out to locate a catalytic residue of the protein, showed that modification of specific residues (Gly(176), Asp(177), Gly(323), and Tyr(324)) leads to a loss of O-PS polymerization. Topology models indicate that these amino acids most likely lie in close proximity on the bacterial surface."

Glucose is the most abundant sugar in human plasma and in many other biological systems and has been the primary focus of sugar transporter studies in eukaryotes. We have previously cloned and characterized a family of glucose transporter genes from the protozoan parasite Leishmania. These transporters, called LmGT1, LmGT2, and LmGT3, are homologous to the well characterized glucose transporter (GLUT) family of mammalian glucose transporters. We have demonstrated that LmGT proteins are important for parasite viability. Here we show that one of these transporters, LmGT2, is a more effective carrier of the pentose sugar d-ribose than LmGT3, which has a 6-fold lower relative specificity (Vmax/Km) for ribose. A pair of threonine residues, located in the putative extracellular loops joining transmembrane helices 3 to 4 and 7 to 8, define a filter that limits ribose approaching the exofacial substrate binding pocket in LmGT3. When these threonines are substituted by alanine residues, as found in LmGT2, the LmGT3 permease acquires ribose permease activity that is similar to that of LmGT2. The location of these residues in hydrophilic loops supports recent suggestions that substrate recognition is separated from substrate binding and translocation in this important group of transporters.

The location of these residues in hydrophilic loops supports recent suggestions that substrate recognition is separated from substrate binding and translocation in this important group of transporters. Sugars are the primary energy currency for multicellular organisms, entering cells via transport systems that are critical for viability. Yet many unicellular organisms, including protozoan parasites, thrive in environments where sugar levels are low or variable. Glucose transport systems have been extensively studied in both humans and their parasites because this hexose is recognized as a key player in energy metabolism. Dysfunction in human glucose transport systems is implicated in pathologies such as obesity and diabetes, and glucose is the major sugar that is mobilized from mammalian energy reserves. Thus, characterization of glucose uptake has been a major research focus (1Manolescu A.R. Witkowska K. Kinnaird A. Cessford T. Cheeseman C. Physiology. 2007; 22: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, a diverse range of monosaccharide sugars is present in nature, and consequently monosaccharide sugars are of potential physiological importance to heterotrophic organisms. Transport systems for non-glucose monosaccharides have been described in bacteria (2Iida A. Harayama S. Iino T. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 674-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but are much less well understood in eukaryotes. For example, although the pentose sugar ribose is an important metabolic precursor and nutrient, no ribose transporter has been described at the molecular level from any animal. In Arabidopsis (3Klepek Y.S. Geiger D. Stadler R. Klebl F. Landouar-Arsivaud L. Lemoine R. Hedrich R. Sauer N. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 204-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a polyol transporter has recently been cloned that has a broad specificity for sugars, including ribose. In yeast, pentose uptake is mediated by specific isoforms of the large family of hexose transporters (4Sedlak M. Ho N.W. Yeast. 2004; 21: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, ribose uptake is partially blocked by the GLUT 2The abbreviations used are: GLUTglucose transporterMFSmajor facilitator superfamilyTMtransmembrane. inhibitor cytochalasin B, suggesting that ribose uptake may be mediated by members of the GLUT family of sugar transporters (5Lager I. Fehr M. Frommer W.B. Lalonde S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The paucity of information about the uptake of ribose in eukaryotes arises, in large part, because the multiplicity of sugar transporters in higher organisms confounds attempts to isolate and characterize discrete transport activities. Simple eukaryotes, such as yeast (6Bisson L.F. Coons D.M. Kruckeberg A.L. Lewis D.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 259-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and protozoa (7Barrett M.P. Tetaud E. Seyfang A. Bringaud F. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem.

Thus, functional analysis of any member of this transporter superfamily generates information that is broadly relevant. glucose transporter major facilitator superfamily transmembrane. Leishmania parasites encounter divergent habitats during their life cycle. The promastigote stage, which is adapted to life in the digestive tract of a sand fly vector, encounters a complex mixture of sugars that are derived from the plant-based diet of the insect host (10Young C.J. Turner D.P. Killick-Kendrick R. Rioux J.A. Leaney A.J. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1980; 74: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of glucose transport capacity profoundly affects the ability of Leishmania parasites to complete the insect vector phase of the life cycle (8Burchmore R.J. Rodriguez-Contreras D. McBride K. Merkel P. Barrett M.P. Modi G. Sacks D. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3901-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The amastigote stage is an obligate intracellular parasite of mammalian macrophages where it will likely encounter low glucose levels (11Burchmore R.J. Barrett M.P. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Despite this, expression of a sugar transporter is essential for amastigote viability (8Burchmore R.J. Rodriguez-Contreras D. McBride K. Merkel P. Barrett M.P. Modi G. Sacks D. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3901-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both promastigote and amastigote stages can accumulate (12Burchmore R.J. Hart D.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and metabolize (13Hart D.T. Vickerman K. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1981; 4: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) glucose, and glucose is the predominant sugar in the culture media that are used for axenic culture of both stages. Nevertheless, alternative sugars, such as ribose, may be encountered throughout the parasite life cycle (11Burchmore R.J. Barrett M.P. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and can be utilized as a carbon source (14Berens R.L. Deutsch-King L.C. Marr J.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1980; 49: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, ribose may be essential for promastigote growth when glucose is absent (15Steiger R.F. Black C.D. Acta Trop. 1980; 37: 195-198PubMed Google Scholar). A saturable ribose uptake process has been described in Leishmania donovani with a Km of 2 mm (16Pastakia K.B. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 26: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This study concluded that ribose was transported by a system independent from the well characterized Leishmania hexose transport system because ribose was unable to inhibit glucose or fructose uptake. Saturable ribose uptake has also been reported in Leishmania mexicana (17Maugeri D.A. Cazzulo J.J. Burchmore R.J. Barrett M.P. Ogbunude P.O. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized a family of glucose transporters in L. mexicana called LmGT1, LmGT2, and LmGT3 (18Burchmore R.J. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29118-29126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These transporter isoforms are closely related in sequence but are expressed with unique temporal or spatial patterns. The most divergent member, LmGT1, has a relatively low affinity for glucose and is localized specifically to the parasite flagellum. The biological relevance of this isoform is currently enigmatic. The other two members of the LmGT family, LmGT2 and LmGT3, are greater than 90% identical, have a similar affinity for glucose, and are both expressed at the pellicular surface of the parasite. Both may contribute to glucose uptake, although LmGT2 mRNA is significantly up-regulated in the promastigote stage. However, we report herein that LmGT2 shows a greater capacity and affinity for ribose transport, a functional difference that must be mediated by the limited structural differences between LmGT2 and LmGT3. Recently, we generated a glucose transporter knock-out mutant in L. mexicana (8Burchmore R.J. Rodriguez-Contreras D. McBride K. Merkel P. Barrett M.P. Modi G. Sacks D. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3901-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and have now exploited this null background to compare the substrate specificities of individual transport isoforms expressed in their native context. Herein we show that two very closely related transporters, called LmGT2 and LmGT3, have discrete substrate specificities. LmGT2 binds a broader range of substrates and has a significantly higher affinity for ribose than does LmGT3. Furthermore, by generation of chimeric transporters and extensive site-directed mutants, we localized specific motifs that are important for substrate discrimination. Our results are relevant to understanding substrate discrimination in related transporters of both parasites and their mammalian hosts. L. mexicana WT MNYC/BZ/62/M379 and L. mexicana ΔGT mutant promastigotes were cultured at 25 °C in minimum Eagle's medium, designated HOMEM (19Berens R.L. Brun R. Krassner S.M. J. Parasitol. 1976; 62: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), containing 17 mm d-glucose and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. For the growth studies, cells were adapted to growth in SDM79 (20Brun R. Schönenberger Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) containing 11 mm d-glucose and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and then transferred to SDM80 (21Lamour N. Rivière L. Coustou V. Coombs G.H. Barrett M.P. Bringaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11902-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) without glucose but supplemented with 10 mm ribose and 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated FCS. Growth studies were initiated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml, and cells were counted on an improved Neubauer hemocytometer. LmGT3 and LmGT2 mutants were cloned in the Leishmania expression vector pX63Neo (22LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific in vitro mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis QuikChange XL II kit. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech). L. mexicana ΔGT promastigotes were grown in culture to approximately 8 × 106/ml, washed in cold cytomix (0.15 mm CaCl2, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6), and resuspended in cytomix at 2 × 108/ml. 500-μl aliquots were electroporated in the presence of 10–20 μg of circular plasmid DNA (1.5 kV, 25 microfarads) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II apparatus with 0.4-cm-electrode gap cuvettes and immediately transferred to 20 ml of HOMEM, 10% FCS. After 24-h incubation at 25 °C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of fresh HOMEM, 10% FCS with G418 (Calbiochem) at 50 μg/ml. Transporter mutations in transgenic cell lines were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Genomic DNA of transgenic parasites was isolated as follows. 5 ml of late log promastigote culture was pelleted, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS). Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 1% Sarkosyl, 100 μg of Proteinase K) and incubated at 50 °C overnight. The DNA was then extracted with 1 volume of phenol and 1 volume of chloroform. The aqueous phase was re-extracted with 1 volume of chloroform. The DNA was precipitated and resuspended in 100 μl of H2O. The transgenic transporters were amplified from genomic DNA using GT2-specific primers 5′-TAGGTCCGAAAAGGAGCCC-3′ and 5′-GAAGCGAACATACAGCG-3′ or GT3-specific primers 5′-GAACTGGTTGTCCGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCACGCACACGCACGTC-3′. The amplified products were sequenced by MWG Biotech to confirm the presence of the correct mutation in the transgenic cell lines. 6-[3H]Glucose (10–20 Ci/mmol) and 1-[3H]ribose (10–20 Ci/mmol), supplied by Moravek Biochemicals Inc., were utilized for all transport assays. Mid- to late log phase L. mexicana promastigotes, transfected with LmGT2, LmGT3, or mutant constructs, were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 3–5 × 108 cells/ml. Transport of radiolabeled ribose and glucose was measured at 25 °C with uptake found to be linear over 90 s for glucose and 6 min for ribose. The assays were terminated by spinning the cells in microcentrifuge tubes through an oil cushion of dibutyl phthalate/mineral oil (9:1) (Sigma) followed by immediate snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. The frozen cell pellet was clipped off into a scintillation vial, and 200 μl of 1% SDS was added. After 30 min, 4 ml of Optiphase HiSafe II scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The samples were mixed, incubated overnight, and then analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Analysis of the data was performed using the software package Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Transport kinetics were determined from replicate substrate saturation curves using the Michaelis-Menten equation (n = 3). We have previously reported that L. mexicana promastigotes express a saturable ribose transport system that is competitively inhibited by glucose but that a large excess of ribose was unable to block net glucose uptake measured in these cells (17Maugeri D.A. Cazzulo J.J. Burchmore R.J. Barrett M.P. Ogbunude P.O. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that one of the three functionally characterized LmGT transporters might also mediate ribose uptake, we measured uptake of 0.1 mm ribose in LmGT-null mutants that express individual LmGT isoforms (Fig. 1a). LmGT-null mutant promastigotes showed negligible ribose uptake, whereas expression of LmGT2 conferred ribose transport capacity that was similar to that observed in wild type promastigotes. Expression of LmGT1 or LmGT3 did not restore ribose uptake to wild type levels, suggesting that LmGT2 is the major ribose transporter in L. mexicana promastigotes. We also tested the ability of LmGT2 and LmGT3 to support the growth of Leishmania in medium that contained ribose as the major carbon source and the only sugar (Fig. 1b). Wild type Leishmania promastigotes grew robustly in glucose-free medium supplemented with 10 mm d-ribose, albeit more slowly than in standard culture medium containing glucose (8Burchmore R.J. Rodriguez-Contreras D. McBride K. Merkel P. Barrett M.P. Modi G. Sacks D. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3901-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). LmGT-null mutant promastigotes grew poorly in glucose-free medium supplemented with 10 mm d-ribose. Expression of LmGT2 permitted growth in medium containing 10 mm d-ribose at a rate similar to that observed for wild type promastigotes, but expression of LmGT3 did not. This result clearly shows that Leishmania promastigotes can utilize ribose as a carbon source and, consistent with the evidence from ribose transport assays, indicates that LmGT2 is the primary ribose transporter in Leishmania. Nevertheless, LmGT3 was able to mediate some ribose uptake. To quantify the relative ribose transport capacity of LmGT2 and LmGT3, we performed parallel glucose and ribose uptake assays in promastigotes expressing only LmGT2 or LmGT3. The initial rate of ribose uptake by LmGT2 was 8-fold greater than the rate of ribose uptake by LmGT3, although the rate of glucose uptake was similar in each. We measured a Km for ribose uptake by LmGT2 of 0.98 ± 0.31 mm, whereas the Km for ribose uptake by LmGT3 was 5.75 ± 2.11 mm (Fig. 2). LmGT2 and LmGT3 have a similar Vmax for d-ribose transport (367 ± 32 and 352 ± 59 pmol/min/107 cells, respectively). The specificity constant for ribose transport, indicated by the Vmax/Km ratio, is 6-fold greater for LmGT2 than for LmGT3 (Vmax/Km of 374 for LmGT2 as opposed to 61 for LmGT3). The predicted amino acid sequences of LmGT2 and LmGT3 are very similar (Fig. 3a), and the predicted topology is identical (Fig. 3b). The transporters are divergent at both amino and carboxyl termini. Internal to these divergent domains, there are only 12 amino acid differences. We performed systematic mutagenesis to generate a battery of full-length chimeric LmGT mutants in which specific domains or residues were exchanged between the LmGT2 and the LmGT3 sequence. Throughout this work, mutant LmGT constructs are systematically described with the LmGT3 amino acid residue position, prefixed by single letter code for the LmGT3 residue and suffixed by the LmGT2 residue. All site-directed mutants are modifications of the LmGT3 protein, replacing specific residues with the corresponding but divergent LmGT2 residue. Mutant LmGT transporters were expressed in LmGT-null L. mexicana promastigotes, and the apparent rates of transport for glucose and ribose were measured by well established methods. LmGT2 and LmGT3 differ primarily in their amino-terminal domain, and thus, we first investigated a potential role for this region in ribose transport. A chimeric LmGT transporter, comprising the amino-terminal domain of LmGT3 in place of the corresponding region in LmGT2 (LmGT3N/2), transported both glucose and ribose at a rate similar to that of wild type LmGT2 (Fig. 4). The inverse construct, where the amino-terminal domain of LmGT2 replaced the corresponding region in LmGT3 (LmGT2N/3), was able to transport glucose at the same rate as either LmGT2 or LmGT3 but transported ribose at a rate similar to that of LmGT3. This result clearly shows that the amino-terminal domain of LmGT2 does not control discrimination between glucose and ribose substrates. A chimeric LmGT transporter, comprising the carboxyl-terminal domain of LmGT3 in place of the corresponding region in LmGT2 (LmGT3/2C), transported both glucose and ribose, whereas the inverse construct, where the carboxyl-terminal domain of LmGT2 replaced the corresponding region in LmGT3 (LmGT2/3C), was able to transport glucose but transported ribose only weakly (Fig. 5). This result clearly shows that the carboxyl-terminal domain of LmGT2 does not control discrimination between glucose and ribose substrates. Interestingly, replacement of the carboxyl-terminal domain of LmGT3 with that of LmGT2 generated a chimeric protein (LmGT3/2C) that transported both glucose and ribose at greater than double the rate observed for wild type LmGT2, suggesting that sequences in the carboxyl terminus of LmGT2 may be important for transporter activity. Because neither the widely divergent amino or carboxyl termini could account for the ribose discrimination between GT2 and GT3, we turned our attention to those residues that differentiate the transporters internally. A battery of site-directed mutants was generated to address the role in glucose and ribose transport of each of the internal amino acids that diverge between LmGT2 and LmGT3. All of these mutant LmGT3 proteins exhibited robust glucose transport capacity, confirming that each is functionally expressed (Fig. 6b). This observation is unsurprising because each mutated residue is exchanged for the corresponding residue in LmGT2, which displays glucose transport characteristics similar to those of LmGT3. However, several mutant LmGT3 proteins showed augmented ribose transport capacity without individually creating a carrier whose ribose transporter capacity was equivalent to that of LmGT2 (Fig. 6a). This indicates that multiple residues, working in concert, are responsible for differential substrate specificity. Ribose transport was significantly higher in LmGT3 mutants Y201C, T205A, T365A, and L477F (p ≤ 0.05; n = 3). No structural information is available for LmGT proteins, and high resolution structural data have been obtained only for very divergent prokaryotic MFS proteins (24Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 25Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis suggests that all MFS proteins have 12 transmembrane helices, and topology studies with MFS glucose transporters, particularly the archetypal human glucose transporter GLUT1, confirm this arrangement and demonstrate that both amino and carboxyl termini are cytoplasmically oriented (26Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of LmGT2 and LmGT3 allowed prediction of the 12 likely transmembrane (TM) domains (Fig. 3) and enabled the topology of the divergent residues to be inferred. In addition to the divergent protein termini, clusters of divergent residues are located in TM11 and in the extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4, including the T205A mutation that alone confers greater than 50% of LmGT2 ribose transport capacity on LmGT3. An identical point mutation, T365A, is located in the relatively long extracellular loop that connects transmembrane domains 7 and 8 (Fig. 3b). We hypothesized that these divergent residues, although distant from one another in the LmGT2 polypeptide chain, might interact in the transporter structure because they are located in flexible loops. We therefore generated two LmGT3 mutants in which more than one residue was altered from the wild type sequence to the corresponding residue in LmGT2 and assessed these mutants for the capacity to transport both glucose and ribose (Fig. 7). Of these mutants, the double mutant T205A/T365A conferred upon LmGT3 a ribose transport capacity of 6.8 pmol/107 cell/min, which was not significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from that measured for LmGT2, 7.2 pmol/107 cell/min. The Km for ribose transport by this mutant was 3.55 ± 0.93 mm, and the Vmax was 483 ± 48 pmol/min/107 cells, giving a specificity constant of 136. Two amino acid residues that are located at the extracellular face of the protein structure are thus important to control discrimination between glucose and ribose in LmGT. Leishmania promastigotes are routinely cultivated in high concentrations of glucose. Leishmania encounter many other sugars during their life cycle (10Young C.J. Turner D.P. Killick-Kendrick R. Rioux J.A. Leaney A.J. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1980; 74: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Molyneux D.H. Moore J. Maroli M. Parassitologia. 1991; 33: 431-436PubMed Google Scholar), but the utilization of these alternative carbohydrate energy sources has been largely overlooked. Most eukaryotes encode multiple putative glucose transporters (TransportDB), which may show different temporal and spatial expression patterns. An additional level of complexity may be conferred by postulating differential substrate specificities among structurally similar transporters. However, this possibility has proven more challenging to address because it requires functional expression of individual transporter isoforms in a null background. Although heterologous expression systems are frequently exploited to study transporter activity, the heterologous context may alter function. For this reason, we sought to exploit a glucose transporter-null Leishmania parasite as a homologous expression system for individual Leishmania glucose transporters. Our present data show that L. mexicana promastigotes take up ribose via a membrane transporter, LmGT2, that has previously been characterized as a hexose transporter. Although ribose is a ubiquitous sugar of central importance in metabolism, molecular characterization of ribose transport in a eukaryote has only recently been reported in plants (3Klepek Y.S.

The demonstration that a hexose transporter of the major facilitator superfamily can also transport ribose is of general relevance. Significant levels of ribose have been identified in analysis of the carbohydrate content of the sandfly vector of Leishmania (28Cameron M.M. Pessoa F.A. Vasconcelos A.W. Ward R.D. Med. Vet. Entomol. 1995; 9: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Leishmania can transport (16Pastakia K.B. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1980; 49: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) ribose, and our unpublished data indicate that ribose can support growth of Leishmania. Ribose may also be an important energy source for the intracellular amastigote stage (11Burchmore R.J. Barrett M.P. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We recently generated a hexose transporter-null L. mexicana mutant (8Burchmore R.J. Rodriguez-Contreras D. McBride K. Merkel P. Barrett M.P. Modi G. Sacks D. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3901-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and noticed that this line was also deficient in ribose transport. Results presented herein show that ribose transport is mediated most robustly by a specific isoform (LmGT2) of the LmGT family of proteins, which have previously been characterized as glucose transporters (18Burchmore R.J. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29118-29126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). LmGT2 and LmGT3 are membrane transport proteins that transport the hexose sugar glucose with similar affinity (109 ± 22 and 208 ± 40 μm, respectively). The proteins are very similar to each other in sequence but show functional differences (8Burchmore R.J. Rodriguez-Contreras D. McBride K. Merkel P. Barrett M.P. Modi G. Sacks D. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3901-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Burchmore R.J. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29118-29126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Remarkably, LmGT2 exhibits a higher affinity for the pentose sugar d-ribose (∼1 mm compared with ∼6 mm for LmGT3), and the specificity constant (Vmax/Km) for ribose transport by LmGT2 is ∼6-fold greater than for ribose transport by LmGT2. In addition, we have observed that glucose uptake via LmGT2 is more sensitive to competitive inhibition by sugars such as fructose and 2,5-anhydromannitol (data not shown), which, like ribose, adopt a furanose conformation, whereas glucose is predominantly found in a pyranose conformation. We have investigated the molecular basis behind these functional differences using ribose transport capacity as a benchmark. Transporter substrate specificity is rather poorly understood, but detailed study of the GLUT family of human facilitated hexose transporters to which the LmGT proteins are homologous has enabled mapping of residues and domains that are important for function. In the absence of a defined structure, such studies have also elucidated much of the topology of the transporter protein (29Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Structure-function analysis of a range of other MFS members suggests that topology is well conserved across the group, and the sequence homology between transporters from diverse organisms is very significant, particularly in predicted transmembrane helices (30Manning S.K. Woodrow C. Zuniga F.A. Iserovich P. Fischbarg J. Louw A.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30942-30949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Of the 12 TM helices that comprise GLUT1, helices 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 define a water-accessible cavity through which substrate must translocate. The recent definition of the three-dimensional structure of two MFS members (24Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 25Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) supports this notion. Extensive scanning mutagenesis studies have assessed the importance to glucose transport of all the amino acid residues in transmembrane helices of GLUT1 (31Mueckler M. Makepeace C. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5934-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but there has been rather less focus on substrate selectivity and on the functional role of the hydrophilic loops. A QLS motif in helix 7 is important for discrimination between the pyranose glucose and the furanose fructose (32Arbuckle M.I. Kane S. Porter L.M. Seatter M.J. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16519-16527Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Seatter M.J. De la Rue S.A. Porter L.M. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but these amino acids are unlikely to be directly involved in substrate discrimination because they are not exposed to the external solvent (31Mueckler M. Makepeace C. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5934-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GLUT isoforms have been shown to transport a variety of hexose isomers and inositol (1Manolescu A.R. Witkowska K. Kinnaird A. Cessford T. Cheeseman C. Physiology. 2007; 22: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of substrate specificity in GLUT1 mutants (34Manolescu A. Salas-Burgos A.M. Fischbarg J. Cheeseman C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42978-42983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggests that substrate binding involves sequential interaction with residues that line the aqueous pore from the cis- to the trans-opening. A substrate docking study with a GLUT1 homology model revealed the presence of a series of potential hexose binding sites along the pore (35Cunningham P. Afzal-Ahmed I. Naftalin R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5797-5803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), including a site at the outer rim that interacts with d-glucose but not with d-fructose. These data are consistent with passage of substrate through a hydrophilic pore by a multistage process that might act as a molecular filtering funnel. In this model of transporter function, substrate interacts sequentially with multiple binding sites rather than at a single site that can be alternately exposed on cis- and trans-sides of the lipid bilayer. Recent studies on the mechanism of substrate discrimination by GLUT transporters indicate that a residue near the exofacial end of the aqueous pore and remote from the translocation binding site is critical for distinguishing glucose from fructose (34Manolescu A. Salas-Burgos A.M. Fischbarg J. Cheeseman C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42978-42983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Manolescu A.R. Augustin R. Moley K. Cheeseman C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The limited regions of divergence between LmGT2 and LmGT3 are located in regions that have not previously been implicated in substrate discrimination. Our mutagenesis analysis reveals that neither the amino or carboxyl terminus nor most of the other divergent amino acids are important for discrimination of ribose from glucose. However, two alanine residues in LmGT2, which are both substituted for threonine in LmGT3, are together necessary and sufficient to convert LmGT3 into a ribose transporter with capacity similar to that of LmGT2. These amino acids are both located in extracellular hydrophilic loops and act synergistically to discriminate ribose from glucose. We propose that these residues comprise a substrate selectivity filter at the beginning of the substrate translocation pathway. Intramolecular interactions between the hydrophilic loop regions, which are often longer than is necessary to connect hydrophobic helices, may be important for substrate discrimination. Our data indicate that very subtle changes in amino acid sequence are sufficient to alter substrate specificity of a membrane transporter. In Leishmania, this may confer the ability to fine tune sugar transport capacity as it transits between different nutritional environments. A large number of related transporters that are expressed by mammals likely also display unique substrate specificities that have yet to be explored. The majority of residues that diverge between LmGT2 and LmGT3 do not appear to play a role in discrimination between glucose and ribose. These divergences may underpin functional differences that have yet to be identified. The most prominent differences between the two isoforms are at the extreme termini, which are predicted to be cytoplasmically localized. Such regions may play roles in regulation of transporter localization (38Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Snapp E.L. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29543-29548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or activity (23Bunn R.C. Jensen M.A. Reed B.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 36Dauterive R. Laroux S. Bunn R.C. Chaisson A. Sanson T. Reed B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11414-11421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but here we demonstrate unambiguously that they are not responsible for differentiation between glucose and ribose. A remarkable group of four divergent residues in predicted TM11 are positioned such that they will be adjacent on a hydrophobic face of the helix (Fig. 3). A hydrophobic pocket, defined by TM11, is important for GLUT1 transport activity, and it is striking that each of these divergent amino acid positions conserves the hydrophobic character. In GLUT1, transmembrane helix 11 plays a key role in glucose binding. Individual or combined exchange of these divergent residues did not significantly alter transport of ribose or glucose (data not shown), raising the possibility that there may be further functional differences between LmGT2 and LmGT3. Cells express membrane transporters that enable them to acquire hydrophilic compounds such as sugars while maintaining a permeability barrier with their environment. Transporter substrate specificity must therefore be adapted to the nutrient environment which, for Leishmania parasites, changes with life cycle progression. By expressing multiple structurally similar transporters that have discrete substrate specificities, Leishmania enhance their ability to exploit their hosts. Multiple isoforms of homologous membrane transporters are also expressed by mammals where their importance in energy metabolism and in various pathologies is recognized but not yet well understood. Our current work demonstrates that relatively minor changes in transporter sequence can alter substrate specificity and supports the idea that substrate translocation involves sequential interactions. Structural definition of eukaryotic sugar transporters is currently a major research goal because these molecules are key targets for chemotherapy. However, elucidation of substrate specificity, which is important for the design of specific inhibitors, may also require functional studies of the kind reported here.

https://openalex.org/W1979761172,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor Met are responsible for a wide variety of cellular responses, both physiologically during embryo development and tissue homeostasis, and pathologically, particularly during tumor growth and dissemination. In cancer, Met can act as an oncogene on tumor cells, as well as a pro-angiogenic factor activating endothelial cells and inducing new vessel formation. Molecules interfering with Met activity could be valuable therapeutic agents. Here we have investigated the antiangiogenic properties of a synthetic peptide mimicking the docking site of the Met carboxyl-terminal tail, which was delivered into the cells by fusion with the internalization sequences from Antennapedia or HIV-Tat. We showed that these peptides inhibit ligand-dependent endothelial cell proliferation, motility, invasiveness and morphogenesis in vitro to an even greater extent and with much less toxicity than the Met inhibitor PHA-665752, which correlated with interference of HGF-dependent downstream signaling. In vivo, the peptides inhibited HGF-induced angiogenesis in the matrigel sponge assay and impaired xenograft tumor growth and vascularization in Kaposi's sarcoma. These data show that interference with the Met receptor intracellular sequence impairs HGF-induced angiogenesis, suggesting the use of antidocking site compounds as a therapeutic strategy to counteract angiogenesis in cancer as well as in other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2067421493,"StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) mediates the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the process of which is the rate-limiting step for steroidogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of the proximal promoter of the human StAR gene has been well characterized, whereas analysis of its distal control region has not. Recently, we found that SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1) induced the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into steroidogenic cells with the concomitant strong induction of StAR expression. Here, we show, using differentiated MSCs, that StAR expression is regulated by a novel distal control region. Using electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we identified novel SF-1 binding sites between 3,000 and 3,400 bp upstream of StAR. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that the region worked as a strong regulator to exert maximal transcription of StAR. ChIP analysis of histone H3 revealed that upon SF-1 expression, nucleosome eviction took place at the SF-1 binding sites, not only in the promoter but also in the distal SF-1 binding sites. Chromosome conformation capture analysis revealed that the region upstream of StAR formed a chromatin loop both in the differentiated MSCs and in KGN cells, a human granulosa cell tumor cell line, where SF-1 is endogenously expressed. Finally, SF-1 knockdown resulted in disrupted formation of this chromatin loop in KGN cells. These results indicate that the novel distal control region participate in StAR activation through SF-1 dependent alterations of chromatin structure, including histone eviction and chromatin loop formation."

With concerns over public funding cuts for research, some question the timing of the charity's change in funding strategy. UK researchers are debating the merits of the new Wellcome Trust Investigator Awards. With concerns over public funding cuts for research, some question the timing of the charity's change in funding strategy. The birth of Henry Solomon Wellcome in 1853 in a remote part of Wisconsin was ultimately a significant event for British science. The Wellcome Trust charity that resulted from the will he drew up in 1932 funds a significant portion of biomedical research in the UK. This heavyweight funder, with an endowment of £13 billion, spends about £600 million each year on research in the UK; this is comparable to the £720 million spent annually by the UK's Medical Research Council (MRC), the government arm of biomedical research. In contrast, in the US, the nonprofit philanthropic Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI; http://www.hhmi.org/) spent $730 million on research in 2009, a fraction of the $28 billion spent by the US government-funded National Institutes of Health. Given that the Wellcome Trust is a major funder of research in the UK and Ireland, scientists paid attention when the charity announced late last year that it was changing its funding strategy (http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/). The Trust plans to end its traditional project and program grants this summer and to divert the money into new Investigator Awards that will be flexible in length and scale and will focus on individual scientists rather than projects. “Our awards will be anything from four years to seven, and we'll provide people with a scale of support to really tackle important questions,” says Mark Walport, Director of the Wellcome Trust. But he is adamant that this is an evolution, not a revolution. “It is really taking our fellowship model and extending it to people who have salaried jobs,” he says. The Trust's current fellowships fund scientists not directly employed by research institutions or universities. “It has always been a bit illogical that the second you had a salaried position in a university, rather than having that very personal support [in fellowships], people go on to project grants and programme grants,” says Walport. He stresses that the change must also be seen in the context of the Trust's overall portfolio. “Essentially we will have four types of grant. We will have our fellowships and Investigator Awards, our technology translation awards and our Strategic Awards.” The new Investigator Awards will fund both new investigators and senior investigators with a maximum of £425,000 per year for up to 7 years for each award. Applications will be accepted from October 1st this year, with the first awards to be announced in May 2011. But the Wellcome's change in strategy comes as the UK and Ireland face economic woes, budget deficits, and government cuts. The UK general election last month gave the country a coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Before the election, the Conservatives had stressed the importance of innovation, rather than basic science, and their shadow science minister had said major cuts in the science budget would be inevitable. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats had promised no cuts in science spending in their first year. However, with the European Commission warning that the UK budget deficit will reach 12% of GDP this year, topping the list of the 27 EU countries, the UK's new coalition government has promised to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and not raising taxes, with £6 billion in cuts to non-front-line services within the financial year 2010–2011. Although certain areas such as health may be spared cuts, it is doubtful that science will be so lucky. “People are worried that there may be a significant lack of growth in science funding coming and we are in for a very tough time,” says Ray Dolan, Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College, London. Walport is positive about the UK as an environment for medical research but says, “clearly there are economic threats to research, but hopefully the new government will recognise that the future prosperity of the UK depends on the fruits of our intellectual endeavours. Around the world, countries that are good at science are increasing their investment, not cutting it.” Meanwhile Irish scientists, who are eligible to apply for Wellcome Trust support, are already facing steep cuts as the government has begun to tackle its ballooning deficit by cutting €10 billion from across all government sectors. Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) (http://www.sfi.ie/), a government-funded organization that in 2009 handed out €170 million in research grants, was dealt an 11% cut in its allocation for 2010. SFI admits that it will be tough to retain the infrastructure and people it has built up since its launch a decade ago. Ireland's Health Research Board, which spends €50 million on research annually, is shifting its emphasis from basic biomedical research to clinical and health services research, placing further demands on SFI and the Wellcome Trust. Given the economic uncertainty, the Trust's change in funding strategy has met with a mixed reception. Susan Greenfield, professor of pharmacology at the University of Oxford, applauds the decision to fund by person rather than project. “However, I do have serious worries about abolishing project grants altogether,” says Greenfield, who recalls the independence she achieved when she received her first small project grant. Patricia Johnson at Dublin City University, who holds a Wellcome project grant, says these grants will be missed and is doubtful her present work would have been funded under the new regime. “If someone doesn't have an exemplary publication record, it doesn't mean that their idea isn't valid and important and useful,” she says. Her concern is not “about the scheme itself, but the phasing out of project grants.” Greenfield also points out that “You are taking a huge gamble if you concentrate funds onto fewer people that they are indeed the right people at the right time … I'm also a bit concerned about backing winners because you don't know who the winners necessarily are in research,” she adds. People can fade or be late developers or have just one amazing idea. The best way for the Trust to tackle ambitious problems in medical research is to pick exciting scientists, says Adrian Bird at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology in Edinburgh, who is also a Trust governor. “The total number of individuals receiving Wellcome Trust funding in the UK is likely to fall,” he admits, but the Trust's job “is not to necessarily maintain the health of the scientific enterprise in the UK; its mission is more specific. It wants to fund research that is going to advance human health and it will choose whatever way is most likely to succeed.” Weighing up the pros and cons of the new scheme, Ian Robertson of Trinity College Dublin says: “It will be more difficult for some people to get grants, but the chance of getting major breakthroughs by allowing people to pursue a more flexible program of research probably outweighs the disadvantages.” One potential downside, however, is that larger research groups will gobble up more of the pie. Robertson agrees: “That is a disadvantage, but that process has been happening under the existing system, and I'm not sure it is going to change that.” The most extreme view is that the move will help phase out smaller labs altogether. One researcher in a smaller lab commented: “If small labs are phased out, even the larger will suffer, even though they will get the money. It is against the spirit of collaboration and support.” However, Bird says the idea that large groups will be favored is just false. “The assumption that science gets bigger and bigger in order to solve larger problems is not necessarily correct. I personally don't believe there is any need for the size of groups to increase.” Kingston Mills at Trinity College Dublin sees the new Investigator Awards as a strategic move. “They are looking at what is happening in the States and seeing that the US is still ahead of Europe in terms of research output. There is a feeling that by giving more funding to a smaller number of good people the returns will be greater.” The move also dovetails with Wellcome's recently announced Strategic Plan for 2010 to 2020, which acknowledges that scientific discoveries take time, so researchers should be given the time and resources to find answers. The Strategic Plan will focus Wellcome's resources on five major research areas—genetics and genomics, the brain, infectious disease, aging and chronic disease, and nutrition and the environment. Some say that the Trust's switch from projects to people mirrors the successful model of HHMI in the US. “It is very much following the Howard Hughes model of extreme excellence, giving scientists the freedom and flexibility to explore the best ideas,” says one senior UK scientist, who asked not to be named. “The Howard Hughes is the icing on the cake of a very well funded enterprise in American research, but in the UK, the Wellcome Trust has been, together with the MRC, the bulwark keeping biomedical research alive.” He says his institution is likely to do better under the new scheme, and it might be the right way to get the best science done. But he adds: “There's a concern I hear expressed as ‘To those that hath, shall be given.’” Some accuse the Trust of elitism, saying that this switch to HHMI's model reflects a desire for Nobel prizes, but the Trust denies this. And HHMI's President, Robert Tjian, points out that it is through their selection process that they ended up with Nobel laureates. “We had no idea they were going to be the elite. We are looking for people who are doing great science,” he says. “We tend to go for people, quite frankly, because it is easier to judge people than it is to judge projects.” But there are advantages to Wellcome's new scheme in the form of the application itself, which is much shorter than more traditional grant applications. “We will be asking people to articulate a vision, a place they want to go, how they will get there and why they are the ones who will be successful,” explains Alan Schafer, the Trust's Director of Science Funding. Flexibility and vision are the watchwords. “We want people to come in and say this is how much it is going to cost and this is how long it will take,” he says. “What do you want to accomplish overall? Sure it has to be substantiated, but don't tell me the restriction enzyme.” An Expert Review Group, comprising scientists from the UK and overseas, will review proposals and select candidates, whose applications will then be peer reviewed; a shortlist of applicants will be invited for an interview. The personal interview has found favor with many. “I would love the opportunity to talk to somebody face to face. Sometimes you get reviews back and don't have any recourse. Perhaps you didn't put something clearly enough or maybe a reviewer picks up on something slight that you could easily defend,” says Johnson. And Schafer notes that, given his experience on fellowship committees, it is not simply people who interview well who are successful, there has to be substance too. Dolan is confident that the interview will not be an obstacle for young researchers: A younger investigator “might feel intimidated by the fact that they don't have a long track record, but any funding system has to be cognizant of that. These are the young people who are going to be the future backbone of British science,” he says. Indeed the Trust is anxious to reassure young scientists that they will not be disadvantaged by the switch from projects to people. “We will very deliberately have investigator grants for people within the first few years of their salaried positions, because it is important to compare apples with apples,” explains Walport. Schafer concurs: “We have a concern that this program could either be perceived or end up favoring people who are later in their career, who have the Cell, Science, Nature papers,” he says. “We love those sorts of researchers. However, we also strongly want to be funding people to reach their potential instead of continuing to build on their achievements.” The Trust will keep in place its 4 year PhD studentship programmes, as well as its 4 year fellowships for people within a year of completing their PhD. Walport feels that reaction to the change overall has been favorable. “There is a certain amount of excitement; there's a certain amount of apprehension. But the best scientists recognize that this is going to offer them tremendous opportunities,” says Walport. “One of the defects of the project grant system is that people are expected to know what they are going to discover. If you know what you are going to discover, it is probably not worth discovering,” he notes. “When you talk to the scientific community and scientists individually, they complain about the short-term nature of the project grant, about the fact that it limits ambition, and yet, on the other hand, people are remarkably conservative about the funding models.” Peter Donnelly, Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in Oxford, says of the Trust's change in direction that it is an interesting move but is more circumspect regarding its outcome. “Funding good people with more secure and longer term funding makes a lot of sense,” he says. “Exactly what the consequences will be in practice is a bit hard to predict.”"
