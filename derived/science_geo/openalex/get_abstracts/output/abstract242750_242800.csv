https://openalex.org/W2002765492,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a critical regulator of heart function and a cellular receptor for the causative agent of severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS-CoV (coronavirus). ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein, with an extracellular N-terminal domain containing the active site and a short intracellular C-terminal tail. A soluble form of ACE2, lacking its cytosolic and transmembrane domains, has been shown to block binding of the SARS-CoV spike protein to its receptor. In this study, we examined the ability of ACE2 to undergo proteolytic shedding and investigated the mechanisms responsible for this shedding event. We demonstrated that ACE2, heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and endogenously expressed in Huh7 cells, undergoes metalloproteinase-mediated, phorbol ester-inducible ectodomain shedding. By using inhibitors with differing potency toward different members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of proteases, we identified ADAM17 as a candidate mediator of stimulated ACE2 shedding. Furthermore, ablation of ADAM17 expression using specific small interfering RNA duplexes reduced regulated ACE2 shedding, whereas overexpression of ADAM17 significantly increased shedding. Taken together, these data provided direct evidence for the involvement of ADAM17 in the regulated ectodomain shedding of ACE2. The identification of ADAM17 as the protease responsible for ACE2 shedding may provide new insight into the physiological roles of ACE2.

Unlike ACE, which functions as a peptidyl dipeptidase, ACE2 acts as a carboxypeptidase, able to cleave a single C-terminal residue from a number of physiologically significant peptides (3Tipnis S.R.

Although the precise physiological role of ACE2 remains to be identified, studies in vivo have revealed that ACE2 is an essential regulator of heart function (5Crackower M.A. Sarao R. Oudit G.Y.

ACE2 is also thought to have an important regulatory role in the renin-angiotensin system through its ability to convert the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to the vasodilatory peptide angiotensin-1-7 (6Zisman L.S.

In addition, ACE2 has been recently identified as a functional receptor for the causative agent of severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the SARS coronavirus (7Li W. Moore M.J. Vasilieva N. Sui J. Wong S.K. Berne M.A. Somasundaran M. Sullivan J.L. Luzuriaga K. Greenough T.C. Choe H. Farzan M. Nature. 2003; 426: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (4100) Google Scholar, 8Wang P. Chen J.

Like ACE, ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein comprising a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a heavily N-glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain containing the active site (3Tipnis S.R.

ACE2 has a more restricted tissue distribution than ACE, being found predominantly in the heart, kidneys, and testes (3Tipnis S.R. Hooper N.M. Hyde R. Karran E. Christie G. Turner A.J. J. Biol.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that the proteolytic shedding of cell surface proteins is an important mechanism regulating their expression and function. This ectodomain shedding event has been observed for a variety of membrane proteins with distinct functions, including cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), fractalkine), enzymes (ACE, β-site amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE)), adhesion molecules (L-selectin), and proteins associated with neuropathological disorders (amyloid precursor protein (APP), cellular prion protein) (11Black R.A.

Although many of these proteins are shed in vitro under normal cell culture conditions, shedding is often stimulated by phorbol esters such as PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) and a number of other factors (18Bosenberg M.W.

Both constitutive and PMA-stimulated ectodomain shedding appear to be mediated largely by members of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) of zinc-metalloproteinases (reviewed in Ref. 20Arribas J. Borroto A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4627-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The best characterized ADAM protease to date is ADAM17, or TNF-α-converting enzyme, which was first identified as the sheddase for TNF-α but has subsequently been implicated in the shedding of other cell surface proteins (21Garton K.J.

Other members of the ADAM family of proteinases, particularly ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM12, have been implicated as candidate sheddases for a wide range of proteins including APP, CXCL16, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (24Koike H.

In this study, we have sought to determine whether ACE2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage resulting in the release of its ectodomain. We provided evidence that a catalytically active soluble form of ACE2 is cleaved from the membrane by two distinct mechanisms: a low level constitutive shedding and a regulated shedding stimulated by phorbol ester. We further used a variety of strategies to establish that ADAM17 is responsible for the regulated shedding of ACE2. The implications of these findings for the role of ACE2 in vivo are also discussed.

Buckley, University of Leeds) and Huh7 cells (kindly provided by Dr. M. Harris, University of Leeds) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Stable expression of human ACE2 in HEK293 cells was achieved by transfecting pCI-Neo expression plasmids (Promega) encoding full-length ACE2 and neomycin phosphotransferase (5 μg per transfection; see below for construction details) using Genejuice transfection reagent (Novagen). Recombinant clones were selected using 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate (G418; PAA Laboratories GmbH), and expression of ACE2 was confirmed by Western blotting. Plasmid Construction—cDNA encoding full-length human ACE2 (GenBank™ accession number AB046569) was amplified from a human kidney cDNA library (Clontech) using the primer pair 5′-ACGTCCATGTCAAGCTCTTCCTGGCTCCTTCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGGCTAAAAGGAGGTCTGAACATCATCAGTGTTT-3′ (reverse), digested, and ligated into the XbaI and XhoI sites of the pCI-Neo expression vector (Promega). The sequence fidelity of the insert was confirmed by automated sequencing (Lark Technologies Inc.). Murine ADAM17 in pcDNA3.1 (kindly provided by Immunex Corp.) was reamplified using the forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGAGGCGGCGTCTCCT-3′ (containing the Kozak sequence) and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCACTCTGTCTCTTTGCTGTCA-3′. The resulting amplicons were digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the expression vector pcDNA3.1a (BD Biosciences).

Treatment of Cells and Protein Extraction—Cells were grown to 60% confluence in 75-cm3 culture flasks and rinsed twice with serum-free medium prior to experimentation. All pharmacological agents were diluted in OptiMEM (5 ml; Invitrogen), and all incubations were carried out at 37 °C. Proteinase inhibitors were added to cells at the indicated concentrations alongside control flasks treated with an equal volume of Me2SO vehicle. After a 20-min incubation, cells were supplemented with 0.1 μm PMA or an equal volume of Me2SO, and incubation continued for a further 1 (in the case of HEK-ACE2 cells) or 4 h (in the case of Huh7 cells). Medium was harvested and concentrated by centrifugation in 10-kDa Centricon tubes (VivaScience) to a final volume of ∼200 μl. Cells were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by centrifugation, and solubilized in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl. pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Media samples and cell lysates (amounts loaded are indicated in individual figure legends) were separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybaid). Following blocking of nonspecific protein binding sites using 5% (w/v) dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with antibodies directed to the ACE2 ectodomain (1:500), the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 (1:500), ADAM17, ADAM9, or ADAM10 (all diluted 1:1000). Donkey anti-goat and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000. All antibodies were diluted in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorogenic Assay of ACE2—The enzymic activity of recombinant ACE2 was measured using the specific fluorogenic substrate Mca-AP-K(Dnp). Protein (20 μg) was incubated with 50 μm Mca-APK(Dnp) at room temperature, and the fluorescence resulting from substrate hydrolysis was monitored over 1 h using a Victor2 fluorescence plate reader (Wallac). Specific activity was determined using the ACE2 inhibitor C16, a gift from Dr. Natalie Dales (Millennium Pharmaceuticals). The reaction product was quantified using a standard curve generated from known concentrations of Mca. Specific mRNA Silencing (siRNA)—HEK-ACE2 or Huh7 cells were grown to ∼40% confluence in antibiotic-free growth medium and transfected with siRNA duplexes (Eurogentech and Dharmacon) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with 100 nm duplexes targeted to ADAM10, ADAM17, or control duplexes targeted to a scramble sequence or a protein not expressed in mammalian cells (GL2; see Table I for sequence information). Control flasks were subjected to mock transfection with double distilled H2O. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and assayed for specific gene silencing by Western blotting.Table ISequences of sense strands of double-stranded RNA used to ablate specific protein expression in HEK-ACE2 and Huh7 cellsTargetSense strand sequenceADAM9a5′-UCACUGUGGAGACAUUUGC99-3′ADAM9b5′-ACUUCCAGUGUGUAGAUGC99-3′ADAM10a5′-UGAAGAGGGACACUUCCCU99-3′ADAM10b5′-GUUGCCUCCUCCUAAACCA99-3′ADAM17a5′-CAUAGAGCCACUUUGGAGA99-3′ADAM17b5′-AGUUUGCUUGGCACACCUU99-3′ADAM17c5′-AGUAAGGCCCAGGAGUGUU99-3′GL-25′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA99-3′ Open table in a new tab Transient overexpression of ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17—HEK-ACE2 or Huh7 cells (∼30–40% confluence) were transfected with 10 μg of ADAM9, ADAM10, or ADAM17 expression plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were rinsed with OptiMEM and incubated in OptiMEM containing 0.1 μm PMA or an equal volume of Me2SO carrier for 1 (HEK-ACE2) or 6 h (Huh7). The medium was harvested and concentrated as described above. To determine whether ACE2 undergoes ectodomain shedding, we first created a stable line of HEK293 cells expressing human ACE2, designated HEK-ACE2. Western blot analysis of detergent extracts collected from HEK-ACE2 cells (Fig. 1, indicated by C) revealed the presence of a polypeptide of ∼120 kDa, corresponding to the mature ACE2 protein (Fig. 1). Immunoblotting of media proteins (M) collected following incubation of HEK-ACE2 cells in OptiMEM for 1 h, using an antibody to the ectodomain of ACE2, revealed two bands of ∼105 and 95 kDa (Fig. 1, left panel). The abundance of the 105-kDa form of ACE2 was significantly enhanced by treatment of the cells with the phorbol ester PMA for 1 h, whereas the abundance of the lower molecular weight species remained unaffected (Fig. 1). Neither form of ACE2, secreted under basal or stimulated conditions, could be detected in the medium by an antibody raised to the cytosolic domain of ACE2 (Fig. 1, right panel), implicating a proteolytic cleavage event, most likely occurring in the extracellular juxtamembrane region. The shed ectodomain of ACE2 was enzymically active as determined by an assay using the fluorogenic peptide Mca-APK(Dnp) (data not shown). We next sought to determine whether the two polypeptides of 95 and 105 kDa, corresponding to shed forms of ACE2, represented different glycosylation states. Treatment of the cellular and media proteins with endoglycosidase H did not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the cell-associated or shed protein; treatment with PNGase F, however, produced bands of ∼85 and 80 kDa for membrane-bound and secreted ACE2, respectively (Fig. 2). Soluble ACE2 released under basal and stimulated conditions had indistinguishable electrophoretic mobility following deglycosylation with PNGase F. These results indicated that the two forms of ACE2 released by cleavage-secretion represent different glycoforms, both containing mature carbohydrate groups. Similar results were obtained in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with ACE2 (data not shown). The shedding of a number of membrane proteins, such as TNFα, APP, and ACE, is inhibited by certain hydroxamic acid-derived metalloprotease inhibitors. Thus, we next examined whether the PMA-stimulated and basal shedding of ACE2 was sensitive to such inhibitors. Both TAPI-1 and GM6001 inhibited the PMA-stimulated release of ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Basal shedding of ACE2 was largely insensitive to both inhibitors in this system, with a maximal decrease in shedding of ∼25% observed (Fig. 3). Having established that PMA-stimulated ACE2 shedding is inhibited by non-selective secretase inhibitors, we next sought to identify the secretase(s) involved. To this end, we used two synthetic compounds displaying differential potency toward two members of the ADAM family of metalloproteinases, ADAM10 and ADAM17. Compound GW280264X is a potent inhibitor of both ADAM10 and ADAM17, whereas compound GI254023X is a potent inhibitor of ADAM10 but has >100-fold reduced potency toward ADAM17 (12Hundhausen C.

Immunoblotting revealed that the mixed ADAM10/ADAM17 inhibitor (GW280264X) effectively blocked stimulated ACE2 shedding at low concentrations, whereas the ADAM10-selective inhibitor (GI254023X) had a much lower potency (Fig. 4). We next tested the ability of the natural inhibitors of ADAMs, TIMP-1 and TIMP-3, to inhibit ACE2 shedding. The purified N-terminal domains of TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 (NTIMP-1 and NTIMP-3) were used as these have greater potency toward their respective proteases (28Lee M-H. Verma V. Maskos K. Nath D. Knauper V. Dodds P. Amour A. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TIMP-3 is a potent inhibitor of ADAM10 and ADAM17, whereas TIMP-1 only inhibits ADAM10 (29Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M.

Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by Western blotting, NTIMP-3 inhibited PMA-stimulated ACE2 shedding in a dose-dependent manner, reducing shedding to below basal levels at 50 nm (Fig. 5). NTIMP-1, in contrast, had little effect on stimulated ACE2 shedding. These data were consistent with ADAM17 being involved in stimulated ACE2 shedding. To confirm the involvement of ADAM17 in stimulated ACE2 shedding, we next used siRNA to reduce the expression of ADAM17, alongside ADAM10, in HEK-ACE2 cells. Western blotting of cell lysates collected from cells transfected with specific siRNAs revealed a significant reduction in the level of both ADAM10 and ADAM17 protein (∼64 and 78%, respectively; Fig. 6A) as compared with cells transfected with siRNA to a control sequence and mock transfected cells. Analysis of media proteins collected following incubation of transfected cells showed an associated decrease in stimulated ACE2 shedding (Fig. 6, A and C). Cells treated with control double-stranded RNA showed no alteration in ADAM10 or ADAM17 expression or ACE2 shedding. To further examine the importance of ADAM17 in stimulated ACE2 shedding, we next transiently overexpressed ADAM17 and its homologues ADAM9 and ADAM10 in HEK-ACE2 cells. Successful overexpression was confirmed by immunoblotting of cell lysates (Fig. 7A). Analysis of media proteins collected from transfected cells incubated in the presence of PMA revealed that overexpression of ADAM17 increased stimulated ACE2 shedding ∼2-fold as compared with the mock transfected cells (Fig. 7, A and B). Overexpression of both ADAM9 and ADAM10 had no significant effect. Having established a role for ADAM17 in the regulated shedding of ACE2 heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, we next sought to determine whether ACE2 is similarly processed in an endogenously expressing system. For these studies, we utilized Huh7 cells, a cell line derived from a hepatocellular carcinoma that expresses significant levels of ACE2 (Fig. 8A) (31Gillim-Ross L. Taylor J. Scholl D.R. Ridenour J. Masters P.S. Wentworth D.E. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2004; 42: 3196-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Analysis of medium harvested from Huh7 cells by immunoblotting with an antibody raised to the ectodomain of ACE2 revealed the presence of two bands, of apparent molecular mass of 95 and 105 kDa, which could not be detected by an antibody directed to the intracellular domain (Fig. 8A). This was in keeping with the results obtained with HEK-ACE2 cells and indicates an ectodomain shedding event. The abundance of the soluble species was elevated by treatment with PMA, resulting in a corresponding increase in ACE2 activity in the media (Fig. 8B). This increase was significantly ablated by the broad range metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 and by the mixed ADAM10/ADAM17 inhibitor GW280264X but was unaffected by the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X (Fig. 8B). The constitutive shedding of ACE2 was not significantly altered by any of the inhibitors tested, suggesting a distinct mechanism, as shown in HEK-ACE2 cells. These results implied a role for ADAM17 in the regulated ectodomain shedding of endogenously expressed ACE2, a finding corroborated by the results of experiments in which the cellular levels of both ADAM17 and ADAM10 were ablated by RNA. Reduction of the expression of ADAM17 significantly decreased the PMA-stimulated shedding of ACE2 in Huh7 cells (Fig. 9, A and B). Ablation of ADAM10 expression did not reduce the stimulated shedding of ACE2 in the same system. Furthermore, overexpression of ADAM17 resulted in an increase in the regulated shedding of ACE2 from Huh7, an effect not seen following overexpression of either ADAM9 or ADAM10 (Fig. 10, A and B).Fig. 9Ablation of ADAM17 expression by siRNA reduces regulated endogenous ACE2 shedding. Huh7 cells (50% confluent) were transfected with double-stranded RNA oligomers (as described under “Materials and Methods”) to ADAM10, ADAM17, or a negative control sequence. After 40 h, the media were aspirated and replaced with OptiMEM containing 100 nm PMA or an equal volume of Me2SO. After a further 5-h incubation, the media were concentrated, and cell lysates were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cell lysates (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for ADAM10 (A) and ADAM17 (B).

Often this shedding event is an important regulatory mechanism (11Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, undergoes proteolytic shedding, releasing an enzymically active ectodomain. Constitutive shedding of both heterologously and endogenously expressed ACE2 resulted in the extracellular release of two forms of the enzyme with distinct electrophoretic mobilities (∼105 and 95 kDa). Both species contain mature carbohydrate moieties, migrating at ∼80 kDa following enzymic deglycosylation with PNGase F. The presence of a single band following deglycosylation suggests that the difference in electrophoretic mobility is a result of differential glycosylation rather than the result of cleavage occurring at two distinct sites. Immunoblotting using antibodies targeted to different domains of ACE2 reveals the absence of cytoplasmic domains in the soluble species, indicating that they are generated by a proteolytic ectodomain shedding event. The ectodomain shedding of ACE2 from HEK-ACE2 and Huh-7 cells was rapidly stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, with a corresponding increase in ACE2 activity in the media. The broad spectrum hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitors, TAPI-1 and GM6001, both inhibited the PMA-stimulated shedding of ACE2 at low micromolar concentrations, with a concomitant reduction in ACE2 activity in the media. Neither inhibitor, however, significantly affected basal shedding, suggesting that distinct mechanisms are responsible for constitutive and phorbol ester-stimulated shedding of ACE2. The sensitivity of stimulated ACE2 shedding to hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors is in keeping with results obtained with many other shed proteins, including TNF-α, fractalkine, and APP, all of which are known to be secreted by members of the ADAMs family of zinc metalloproteases (11Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Evidence of a role for ADAMs proteases in ACE2 shedding was provided by the results of experiments using synthetic inhibitors of two members of this family of proteases, ADAM10 and ADAM17. Stimulated ACE2 shedding was strongly inhibited by the mixed ADAM10/ADAM17 inhibitor but was unaffected by the selective ADAM10 inhibitor. Neither inhibitor significantly abrogated basal shedding, providing further evidence for a distinct shedding mechanism. These data implicated ADAM17 as a candidate sheddase for stimulated ACE2 shedding, a conclusion supported by results gained in HEK-ACE2 cells using the N-terminal domains of two natural inhibitors of metalloproteases, TIMP-1 and TIMP-3. Although TIMP-1 did not inhibit constitutive or stimulated ACE2 shedding, TIMP-3 preferentially inhibited the stimulated shedding. These two members of the TIMP family of glycoproteins, which play an important role in matrix metalloprotease processing and regulation, have been shown to selectively inhibit distinct ADAMs proteases. TIMP-1 is a potent inhibitor of ADAM10 but is ineffective against ADAM8, ADAM9, ADAM12, and ADAM17 (32Amour A. Knight C.G. English W.R. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J.P. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TIMP-3, however, is a potent inhibitor of ADAM17 but also inhibits ADAM10. Direct evidence for the involvement of ADAM17 in the regulated shedding of ACE2 was provided by the results of experiments in which the cellular level of ADAM17 was depleted by specific RNA interference. Abrogation of ADAM17 protein expression resulted in a proportional reduction in stimulated ACE2 shedding while having no significant effect on constitutive shedding. No change in ACE2 shedding was observed following reduction of ADAM10 expression. Furthermore, transient overexpression of ADAM17, but not ADAM9 or ADAM10, resulted in a significant increase in stimulated ACE2 shedding as compared with mock-transfected controls, providing strong evidence that ADAM17 is responsible for regulated shedding of ACE2. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the predicted juxtamembrane stalk region of ACE2 reveals no marked sequence conservation with the corresponding region of ACE. ACE is also subject to ectodomain shedding, but the secretase responsible for this still remains to be identified (33Parvathy S. Hussain I. Karran E. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Allinson T.M.J. Parkin E.T. Condon T.P. Schwager S.L.U. Sturrock E.D. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that ADAM17 is not responsible for ACE ectodomain shedding (33Parvathy S. Hussain I. Karran E. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Allinson T.M.J. Parkin E.T. Condon T.P. Schwager S.L.U. Sturrock E.D. Turner A.J.

Although it is tempting to conclude that this is due to the divergence of sequence in the juxtamembrane region, it is important to note that ADAM17 appears to be able to cleave a diverse array of sequences (21Garton K.J.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been suggested that the structure of the stalk region may be a more important determinant of susceptibility to secretase cleavage than the amino acid sequence around the cleavage site (35Sadhukhan R.

In addition, it has been recently reported that differences observed between the shedding of single and dual domain ACE (with identical juxtamembrane domain sequences) may be due to the occlusion of a sheddase “recognition motif” present within the ectodomain (37Woodman Z.L. Schwager S.L.U. Redelinghuys P. Carmona A.K. Ehlers M.R.W. Sturrock E.D. Biochem. J. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is difficult to predict the physiological importance of ACE2 ectodomain shedding, evidence is available that such a shedding process occurs in vivo. Donoghue et al. (39Donoghue M.

In addition to the possible importance of the shedding of ACE2 to its roles in the heart and the renin-angiotensin system, up-regulation of ACE2 shedding could modulate SARS infectivity. Li et al.

The complete sequence of the 7.1-Mb Pf-5 genome was determined. We analyzed repeat sequences to identify genomic islands that, together with other approaches, suggested P. fluorescens Pf-5's recent lateral acquisitions include six secondary metabolite gene clusters, seven phage regions and a mobile genomic island. We identified various features that contribute to its commensal lifestyle on plants, including broad catabolic and transport capabilities for utilizing plant-derived compounds, the apparent ability to use a diversity of iron siderophores, detoxification systems to protect from oxidative stress, and the lack of a type III secretion system and toxins found in related pathogens. In addition to six known secondary metabolites produced by P. fluorescens Pf-5, three novel secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters were also identified that may contribute to the biocontrol properties of P. fluorescens Pf-5."

https://openalex.org/W2021206670,"Type 2 diabetes is a disorder of hyperglycemia resulting from failure of beta cells to produce adequate insulin to accommodate an increased metabolic demand. Here we show that regulation of mRNA translation through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) is essential to preserve the integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to increase insulin production to meet the demand imposed by a high-fat diet. Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51 and inhibits translation. To elucidate the role of this pathway in beta-cell function we studied glucose homeostasis in Eif2s1tm1Rjk mutant mice, which have an alanine substitution at Ser51. Heterozygous (Eif2s1+/tm1Rjk) mice became obese and diabetic on a high-fat diet. Profound glucose intolerance resulted from reduced insulin secretion accompanied by abnormal distension of the ER lumen, defective trafficking of proinsulin, and a reduced number of insulin granules in beta cells. We propose that translational control couples insulin synthesis with folding capacity to maintain ER integrity and that this signal is essential to prevent diet-induced type 2 diabetes."

We show here that H19 transcription is up-regulated during the S-phase of growth-stimulated cells and that the H19 promoter is activated by E2F1 in breast cancer cells. H19 repression by pRb and E2F6 confirms the E2F1-dependent control of the H19 promoter. Consistently, we demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that endogenous E2F1 is recruited to the H19 promoter in vivo. The functionality of E2F promoter sites was further confirmed by gel shift and mutagenesis experiments, revealing that these sites are required for binding and promoter response to E2F1 exogenous expression and serum stimulation. Furthermore, we show that H19 overexpression confers a growth advantage on breast cancer cells released from growth arrest as well as in asynchronously growing cells. The H19 knockdown by small interfering RNA duplexes impedes S-phase entry in both wild-type and stably H19-transfected cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that the H19 RNA is actively linked to E2F1 to promote cell cycle progression of breast cancer cells.

This clearly supports the H19 oncogenic function in breast tumor genesis. The H19 gene is one of the first genes to have been proven to be imprinted. It is located on chromosome 11 p 15.5 and lies within 200 kbp downstream of the IGF-2 gene (1Zemel S. Bartolomei M.S. Tilghman S.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These two genes are imprinted in opposite directions, so that the paternal IGF-2 and the maternal H19 alleles are selectively expressed (2Giannoukakis N. Deal C. Paquette J. Goodyer C. Polychronakos C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 3Zhang Y. Tycko B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). H19 encodes a spliced and polyadenylated RNA that lacks conserved open reading frames but does have a conserved secondary RNA structure (4Juan V. Crain C. Wilson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Extensive deletions and/or point mutations in the 5′-long untranslated region of an ectopic human H19 RNA enable 26-kDa protein translation (5Joubel A. Curgy J.J. Pelczar H. Begue A. Lagrou C. Stéhelin D. Coll J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 1159-1172PubMed Google Scholar), but no endogenous translation product has so far been identified (6Pachnis V. Belayew A. Tilghman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 7Pachnis V. Brannan C.I. Tilghman S.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was quickly proposed that H19 RNA functions as a riboregulator (8Brannan C.I. Dees E.C. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar).H19 expression is developmentally regulated. It is abundantly expressed in both extraembryonic and fetal tissues and is repressed after birth except in a few adult organs, particularly in the mammary gland (9Douc-Rasy S. Coll J. Barrois M. Joubel A. Prost S. Dozier C. Stéhelin D. Riou G. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 2: 753-758PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dugimont T. Curgy J.J. Wernert N. Delobelle A. Raes M.B. Joubel A. Stéhelin D. Coll J. Biol.

A. 1984; 81: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), its functions have only begun to emerge. It has been reported that H19 RNA was involved in the repression of the IGF-2 oncogene by affecting its transcription (11Wilkin F. Paquette J. Ledru E. Mamelin C. Pollak M. Deal C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or its translation (12Li Y.M. Franklin G. Cui H.M. Svensson K. He X.B. Adam G. Ohlsson R. Pfeifer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28247-28252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, we brought evidence that the H19 gene post-transcriptionally up-regulates the thioredoxin level, a key protein of the cellular redox metabolism (13Lottin S. Vercoutter-Edouart A.S.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Despite interesting new insights, the status of the H19 gene in cancer is still a matter of debate. It has been suggested that H19 functions as a tumor suppressor in some Wilms' tumors, embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma, and the Beckwith-Wiedmann cancer predisposing syndrome (14Okamoto K. Morison I.M.

Mamelin C. Pollak M. Deal C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By contrast, other studies including ours suggest that H19 may play a key role in tumorigenesis and could match the cell aggressiveness (17Lottin S. Berteaux N. Adriaenssens E. Dugimont T. Coll J.

However, despite putative regulatory sequences localized in the H19 promoter and the identification of potential transacting factors, no direct regulation of the H19 promoter has so far been described. In a previous work, we reported a negative regulation of H19 promoter activity by the tumor suppressor p53 that would be mediated by protein/protein interactions (31Dugimont T. Montpellier C. Adriaenssens E. Lottin S. Dumont L. Iotsova V. Lagrou C. Stehelin D. Coll J. Curgy J.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2395-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consistently, Sorensen et al. (32Sorensen T. Girling R. Lee C.W. Gannon J. Bandara L. La Thangue N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5888-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) proposed a functional interaction between p53 and DP1 (an E2F1 transcriptional partner) to explain the loss of the dihydrofolate reductase promoter activation by E2F1 in SAOS-2 cells. Because of the presence of two putative E2F consensus sites in the H19 minimal promoter, we hypothesized a similar mechanism for H19 promoter control, and we anticipated a role for E2F1 in the regulation of H19 promoter activity. Consequently, we have further investigated the H19 physiological function through this regulation, and we have logically focused on cell cycle progression.E2F transcription factors consist of a related protein family that includes seven distinct E2F members, which act on gene promoters regulated during the cell cycle (33Dyson N. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 18: 81-87Crossref Google Scholar, 34Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). The first member of the E2F family to be cloned, E2F1, is considered to be the critical factor in G1/S transition (35Helin K. Wu C.L. Fattaey A. Lees J. Dynlacht B. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). E2F1 has been shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, whose products participate in cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis and whose expression is up-regulated at the cell cycle G1/S transition (36Fry C. Pearson A. Malinowski E. Bartley S. Greenbalt J. Farnham P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15883-15891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37Othani K. Front.

We focused our work on E2F1 protein, which does have biological consequences in carcinogenesis. Indeed, E2F1 enhances neoplasia in the skin of transgenic mice and causes tumor formation in the liver (39Pierce A.M. Fisher S.M. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Conner E.A. Lemmer E.R. Omori M. Wirth P.J. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5054-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, E2F1 is involved in breast cancer development through transcriptional activation of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 (41Wang A. Schneider-Broussart R. Kumar A.P. Macleod M.C. Johnson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4532-4536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and serves as the primary link between proliferation control and apoptosis (42Ginsberg D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).The purpose of the present study was thus to investigate the role of H19 in the cell cycle via a regulation by E2F1. We report that the cell cycle-dependent regulation of the H19 gene is primarily controlled by E2F1 through binding to H19 promoter. pRb and E2F6, two E2F-dependent transcription inhibitors, repress H19 gene expression. We further focused our study on the biological effect of the H19 gene on cell cycle progression and particularly at the G1-S transition. We show that H19 overexpression confers an obvious growth advantage in breast cancer cells released from growth arrest as well as in asynchronously growing cells. In addition, the knock-down of H19 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) impedes progression through the S-phase of the cell cycle. In conclusion, we elucidate the involvement of the H19 mRNA-like noncoding RNA in cancer cell proliferation. Our results clearly shed light on the oncogenic status of H19 in breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Breast Tissues—The human breast cancer epithelial cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and maintained routinely in MEM, 1The abbreviations used are: MEM, minimal essential medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; siE2F, E2F-specific siRNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siGFP, siRNA targeting the green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PI, propidium iodine. containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). MCF-7 and T47D are estrogen-sensitive cells. BT20 and MDA-MB-231 are estrogen-insensitive cell lines. Normal breast epithelial cells come from primary culture of normal breast tissue resections obtained from modeling surgery. The highly tumorigenic MCF-7Ras cell line corresponds to the H-Ras-transfected MCF-7 cell line. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) provided by Dr. D'Halluin (Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, France) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. To bring cells to quiescence, cultures at 30% confluence were washed with MEM and then serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were serum-stimulated by the addition of 10% FCS to the medium. All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and 95% air. Breast cancer tissues came from biopsies corresponding to intraductal cancers.Growth Assays—Mock-transfected and H19-stably transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were previously cloned (26Lottin S. Adriaenssens E. Dupressoir T. Berteaux N. Montpellier C. Coll J. Dugimont T. Curgy J.J. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). For growth assays of serum-stimulated cells, cells were plated in 6-well plates at 100,000 cells/well, serum-starved for 24 h, and induced to reenter the cell cycle by the addition of 10% FCS medium for 48 h. For RNA interference assays, cells were plated in 6-well plates at 150,000 cells/well on day 1. The day after, cells were transfected with respective siRNA sequences. Then cells were grown in 5% FCS containing medium until day 5. Cells were counted each day in a Malassez plate. Student's t test was performed, and the p values obtained are indicated in the figures by asterisks with the following meanings: *, p values < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant; **, p values < 0.01 considered to be highly statistically significant.Reporter Plasmids and Expression Vectors—pCMV-E2F1 was generously provided by Prof. Helin (Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy). pCMV-E2F1Δ is an E2F1 mutant deleted in the transactivation domain. PSG5-Rb was a gift from Dr. Bégue (Institut de Biologie de Lille, France). PHSCdc6-Luc was provided by Prof. Othani (Human Gene Sciences Centre, Tokyo, Japan). The H19-luciferase reporter gene corresponds to the plasmid pGL2 carrying the H19 minimal promoter region (823 bp), associated with the luciferase gene reporter described by Dugimont et al. (31Dugimont T. Montpellier C. Adriaenssens E. Lottin S. Dumont L. Iotsova V. Lagrou C. Stehelin D. Coll J. Curgy J.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2395-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The H19 mutant reporter plasmids were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using PCR. To obtain the single mutant named hereafter Mut-I, we carried out two similar PCRs with the following primers (mutations are indicated in boldface type): Z1, 5′-AACAACCCTCACCAAAGGCC-3′; Y1, 5′-AGGGGGTTTGAAGCACTTCC-3′; Y2, 5′-AGGGCAGGGGCGGGAATTCTGGAAGGCCA-3′; Z2, 5′-TCCTCGGTCCTAGCCCGG-3′. A final PCR with primers Z1 and Z2 permitted us to obtain the total length of the mutated promoter. To obtain the single mutant Mut-II, we carried out a PCR with Z1 and Z3 5′-CTCGGTCCTAGCCCGGGCTTTTTCTAACTGGGGTGGCCTTCCAGAAT-3′. The double mutant (DMut) was obtained by a PCR with Z1 and Z3 using the Mut-I PCR product as matrix. All of the PCR products were cloned into the pCR2–1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Recombined vectors were selected by enzymatic digestion, and mutations were verified by sequencing. The mutated promoters were cloned into pGL2 plasmid associated with luciferase reporter gene.Transfection Assays—Cotransfections were performed by using Lipofectin™ reagent (Invitrogen). 1.2 μg of the reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of the expression plasmid, and 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase were used for 150,000 cells/well, seeded 2 days before transfection. Cells were incubated with transfection reagent for 6 h at 37 °C, followed by a change to a culture medium containing 10% FCS. Cells were harvested with a reporter lysis buffer (Applied Biosystems) 24 h (for MCF-7 cells) and 48 h (for HEK cells) after transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured by using an AB luciferase assay kit and a β-galactosidase assay system kit, as specified by the manufacturer, with a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold).RNA Interference—RNA interference was carried out by using synthetic siRNA duplexes, as described by Elbashir et al. (43Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8083) Google Scholar). Two synthetic siRNA duplexes (siH19A and siH19B), corresponding to the H19 mRNA sequence 5′-CCCACAACAUGAAAGAAAU-3′ and 5′-GCUAGAGGAACCAGACCUU-3′, respectively, were used to inhibit H19 RNA expression. A synthetic siRNA duplex (siE2F) corresponding to a previously described E2F1 mRNA sequence 5′-GGGAGAAGUCACGCUAUGA-3′ was used to inhibit E2F1 protein expression (44Ma Y. Cress W.D. Haura E.B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic siRNA duplex (siGFP) corresponding to the green fluorescent protein mRNA sequence 5′-GCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAUC-3′ was used as a negative control. The siRNA duplexes were purchased from Eurogentec. Cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 400 pmol of siRNAs using Jetsi (Eurogentec, Angers, France), as recommended by the manufacturer. To monitor the transfection efficacy, a tagged siRNA duplex was transfected in parallel, and the transfection rate was evaluated by FACS and seen to correspond to 80–90% of transfected cells. After transfection, cells were lysed for total RNA isolation or counted for growth assays.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the guanidium isothiocyanate-CsCl gradient method (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg) was denatured, electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and transferred by capillarity onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C-extra; Amersham Biosciences). After being baked for 2 h at 80 °C, the membrane was hybridized at 42 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled random primed cDNA probes (Megaprime Labeling System; Amersham Biosciences). The H19 cDNA probe was a 1.3-kbp PstI-digested fragment containing the end of the first exon and exons 2–5. An acid ribosomic phosphoprotein 0 cDNA probe was also used to normalize the H19 signal.Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with the Nucleospin RNAII isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, Belgium). Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of RNAs, 1 μg of random hexamers, 20 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μl. Real time PCR amplifications were performed using a Quantitect SYBR®Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Coutaboeuf, France) with 2 μl of cDNA and 500 nm of primers. The primers used were as follows: 5′-GGAGTGAATGAGCTCTCAGG-3′ and 5′-CTAAGGTGTTCAGGAAGGCC-3′ for the H19 transcript; 5′-TTACTTCCTCCACGGAGTCG-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGATAGCGACACGTGG-3′ for H19 near the siH19A; 5′-GGCCTTTGAATCCGGACACA-3′ and 5′-TGGCCATGAAGATGGAGTCG-3′ for H19 near the siH19B; 5′-CCGTGGACTCTTCGGAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GGGACAACAGCGGTTCTTGC-3′ for E2F1, and 5′-GTGATGTGCAGCTGATCAAGACT-3′ and 5′-GATGACCAGCCCAAAGGAGA-3′ for RPLPO (human acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO), which was used as a reference gene. The subsequent PCR conditions were 40 cycles, carried out in the following manner: 95 °C for 15s, 60 °C for 20s, and 72 °C for 30s. Data were analyzed using the MX4000 PCR system software (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with the SYBRGreen option (with dissociation curves). Standard curves were performed on serial dilutions of a PCR product for H19 and on serial dilutions of genomic human DNA for RPLPO. Values were obtained by the calculation methodology recommended by Pfaffl et al. (46Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (24969) Google Scholar): ratio = (cycle number - b/a) target/(cycle number - b/a) reference (where a = slope of the standard curve and b = ordinate of origin).Western Blot—Nontransfected or RNAi-transfected cells were harvested in lysis buffer. 30 μg of lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting (30 V, overnight), and probed with anti-E2F1 (sc-251; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-actin antibodies. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horse peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Jackson Laboratories). The reaction was revealed using the chemiluminescence kit ECL (Amersham Biosciences) with Eastman Kodak Co. hyperfilm.Fluorescent Analysis and Cell Sorting (FACS)—Cells from a 10-cm diameter dish were trypsinized, centrifuged, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. For transfected cells, selection was made with the cotransfection of a GFP expression plasmid. In this case, cells were previously fixed in paraformaldheyde solution for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, and subsequently fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min at 4 °C. For propidium iodine (PI) staining, cells were washed twice in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in 500 μl of PI buffer (500 μl of PBS, 100 μg of PI, and 100 μg of RNase A). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACScan.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Detection of promoter-bound E2F1 proteins was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, essentially as previously described (47Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 48Blais A. Monté D. Pouliot F. Labrie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31679-31693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with formaldehyde to form cross-links between E2F and associated promoter regions. Chromatin was then isolated, fragmented by sonication, and subjected to immunoprecipitation by using antibody directed against E2F1 (catalog number SC-193; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An antibody against the FLAG epitope (catalog number SC-807; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a negative control (nonrelevant antibody). To detect the H19 gene in protein-DNA complexes, a 141-bp fragment located in the promoter was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-GTCTGGGAGGGAGAGGTCCT-3′ and 5′-CCACTCTCTCTGCACACGAC-3′. The primers used to detect the E2F1 gene promoter were the same used by others (48Blais A. Monté D. Pouliot F. Labrie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31679-31693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The two genes were detected by 34 cycles of PCR. A negative control primer pair located downstream to the enhancers at +40510 bp to the H19 start site was used to attest to the binding specificity. The primer sequences were as follows: 5′-CTCTCCTCTCTCGACCTGTC-3′ and 5′-GCAGCAGTGTCTCAGGAGAG-3′. For this condition, PCR was extended to 42 cycles to ascertain the irrelevance of amplifications obtained for immunoprecipitations with nonrelevant and α-E2F1 antibodies.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated corresponding to the wild-type or E2F-mutated site II of the H19 promoter. The wild-type oligonucleotide was end-labeled for use as a probe. The E2F binding site is underlined, and the mutated nucleotides are shown in boldface type: H19WT, 5′-GAATTCTGGCGGGCCACCCCA-3′; H19mut, 5′-GAATTCTGGAAGGCCACCCCA3′. These double-stranded oligonucleotides were also used as competitors at a 400-fold molar excess. As a positive control, we also competed with a typical E2F site from Nushift™ Kit (Geneka Biotechnology, Inc., Strasbourg, France). For binding experiments, the following components were mixed and preincubated at room temperature for 15 min and depending on the experiment: 4 μl of complete cell extracts of COS7 cells transiently both transfected and untransfected by E2F1 vector, 1 μg of competitors, 4 μl of E2F1 monoclonal antibody (Nushift™ kit), and 10 μl of binding buffer (500 ng of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) in a final assay volume of 20 μl. Following preincubation, the labeled oligonucleotide was added (2.5 ng), and the mixtures were incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded onto a 4% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The gel was dried, and autoradiography was performed.RESULTSH19 Expression Is Transcriptionally Up-regulated during the S-phase of Cells Stimulated to Enter the Cell Cycle—Cell growth-dependent control of the E2F1 gene and E2F1-regulated genes has been described (37Othani K. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 793-804Crossref Google Scholar, 49Hateboer G. Wobst A. Petersen B.O. Le Cam L. Vigo E. Sardet C. Helin K. Mol. Cell.

We previously showed down-regulation of H19 by p53 and anticipated a possible role for p53 in E2F1 activity repression (31Dugimont T. Montpellier C. Adriaenssens E. Lottin S. Dumont L. Iotsova V. Lagrou C. Stehelin D. Coll J. Curgy J.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2395-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These indications led us to examine whether H19 expression was cell cycle-dependent in MCF-7 cells. Cells were serum-starved and subsequently induced to reenter the cell cycle by serum addition. Cells were harvested after starvation or at various times following serum addition. Fig. 1A shows the FACS analysis of these cells, indicating that most of them are in the S-phase after 32 h of stimulation. Cells treated under these various conditions were checked for expression levels of both H19 and E2F1 RNAs. Expression levels of both genes were low in serum-starved cells (Fig. 1B). As expected, E2F1 transcription was up-regulated by serum addition, with a peak at the G1/S-phase boundary (16–20 h). In parallel, H19 mRNA synthesis was activated and reached a high expression level at 32 h, coinciding with the greatest number of cells in S-phase. Thus, both genes are transcriptionally activated after serum addition, although the timing differs, since the target H19 gene response takes longer than the E2F1 induction. Collectively, these results show the cell cycle-regulated expression of the H19 gene and suggest that H19 is likely to be regulated by E2F1.E2F1 Activates the H19 Promoter—The H19 gene possesses a TATA-less promoter, a feature reminiscent of many known E2F-responsive genes. Moreover, a screening of the H19 promoter sequences revealed two putative E2F recognition sites in proximity to the H19 transcription start site (sites I and II"
https://openalex.org/W2009911964,"Activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 regulates expression of phase II enzymes and other adaptive responses to electrophile and oxidant stress. Nrf2 concentrations are regulated by the thiol-rich sensor protein Keap1, which is an adaptor protein for Cul3-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. However, the links between site specificity of Keap1 modification by electrophiles and mechanisms of Nrf2 activation are poorly understood. We studied the actions of the prototypical Nrf2 inducer tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and two biotin-tagged, thiol-reactive electrophiles, N-iodoacetyl-N-biotinylhexylenediamine (IAB) and 1-biotinamido-4-(4′-[maleimidoethyl-cyclohexane]-carboxamido)butane (BMCC). Both IAB and tBHQ induced antioxidant response element (ARE)-directed green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in ARE/thymidine kinase GFP HepG2 cells, and both initiated nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and induction of heme oxygenase 1 in HEK293 cells. In contrast, BMCC produced none of these effects. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) analysis of human Keap1 modified by IAB or BMCC in vitro indicated that IAB adduction occurred primarily in the central linker domain, whereas BMCC modified other Keap1 domains. Treatment of FLAG-Keap1-transfected HEK293 with the Nrf2-activating compounds IAB and tBHQ generated high molecular weight Keap1 forms, which were identified as K-48-linked polyubiquitin conjugates by immunoblotting and liquid chromatography MS-MS. Keap1 polyubiquitination coincided with Nrf2 stabilization and nuclear accumulation. In contrast, BMCC did not induce Keap1 polyubiquitination. Our results suggest that Nrf2 activation is regulated through the polyubiquitination of Keap1, which in turn is triggered by specific patterns of electrophile modification of the Keap1 central linker domain. These results suggest that Keap1 adduction triggers a switching of Cul3-dependent ubiquitination from Nrf2 to Keap1, leading to Nrf2 activation.

Cellular defense against electrophiles and oxidants relies on detoxication by phase II biotransformation enzymes, antioxidant enzymes, and related stress response proteins (1Kensler T.W. Environ.

Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Keap1 has five domains, an N-terminal domain, a BTB domain, a central linker domain, a Kelch repeat domain, and a C-terminal domain. The Kelch repeat domain is tethered to cytoskeletal actin and binds to Nrf2 directly (15Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar, 16Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. O'Connor T. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The central linker domain is the most cysteine-rich domain and is required for cytoplasmic sequestration of Nrf2 (17Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Intact cytoskeleton is also critical for allowing Keap1 to bind Nrf2 and prevent its translocation to nuclei (17Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 18Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Wakabayashi N. Kim S.G. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Site-directed mutation of Keap1 led to the hypothesis that the rate-limiting step for Nrf2 stabilization resided at the level of Keap1-directed ubiquitination of Nrf2 (19Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10941-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 may represent a second regulatory step that allows Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of ARE-dependent genes.The mechanism by which electrophiles induce Nrf2-dependent transcription is inadequately understood but appears to involve modification of specific Keap1 cysteine residues. Only four cysteine residues in murine Keap1 (Cys-257, Cys-273, Cys-288, and Cys-297) have been shown to preferentially react with the prototypical alkylating agent dexamethasone 21-mesylate in vitro (22Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Mutation of Keap1 at Cys-273 or Cys-288 impaired the ability of murine Keap1 to repress Nrf2-dependent transcription (23Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). These studies led to the suggestion that dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1-Nrf2 may be regulated by the redox status of these specific cysteine residues.We employed two cell-permeable, thiol-reactive biotintagged electrophiles to probe the relationship between Keap1 alkylation and Nrf2 activation. Electrophile-specific adduction patterns were observed in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) analyses of purified human Keap1. Electrophile-specific adduction was coincident with electrophile-specific Keap1 ubiquitination, Nrf2 stabilization, nuclear Nrf2 translocation, and ARE/EpRE-dependent gene activation. These novel data provide compelling support for the hypothesis that electrophile-directed Keap1 ubiquitination represents a rate-limiting step for electrophile-directed Nrf2-dependent gene activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were obtained frozen at low passage from Master Cell Bank cultures from Invitrogen. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells containing an ARE/thymidine kinase green fluorescent protein reporter (ProCertus Biopharm) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and containing 1 mg/ml Geneticin. Confluent cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-Keap1 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent at a ratio of 1:6 DNA/Lipofectamine and then were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 5 h at 37 °C. Medium with 500 μg/ml Geneticin was used to select the single cell colonies stably expressing FLAG-Keap1. Confluent cells in 100-mm plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 100 μm IAB or BMCC (both from Pierce), or equal volumes of vehicle (Me2SO at 0.3% of total volume) were delivered in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum.Cell Fractionation and Immunoblot Analyses—Confluent cells in 75-cm flasks were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold nuclear lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340). Lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min, and supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed twice with nuclear lysis buffer to remove cytosolic contaminants, and nuclear pellet was lysed by treatment with all protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, pH 8.0) containing 5 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture followed by sonication for 5 s. The nuclear lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was measured with BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Cell lysate proteins were diluted 1:1 (v:v) with 5× SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 4–20% Tris-HCl ready gels (Bio-Rad). Resolved proteins then were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blocked with 5% milk in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then probed with anti-HO-1 (proved by Dr. Chris Ferris), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-Keap1 (Santa Cruz), anti-biotin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-Nrf2 (Santa Cruz) in 5% milk in TBST buffer. After treatment with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz), immunostained proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with Western blotting luminol reagent (Santa Cruz).Covalent Adduction of Model Electrophiles to His6-Keap1 in Vitro— Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was transfected with plasmid pET-15b(+)hKeap1, which encodes a full-length cDNA copy of human Keap1 inserted between the NdeI and XhoI sites. His6-Keap1 was expressed by the method developed by Dinkova-Kostova (22Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), except that LB medium was used to grow bacteria. To prevent protein aggregation and precipitation by disulfide bond formation, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to lysate buffer. His6-Keap1 protein then was purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen). To maintain Keap1 solubility, the purified protein was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm mercaptoethanol before concentration and storage.Ultrafree-MC low binding regenerated cellulose centrifugal spin filter devices with a 30,000 molecular weight cutoff were obtained from Millipore. Before sample addition, spin filters were sequentially rinsed with 200 μl of methanol and 200 μl of distilled water by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Keap1 (60–70 μg) was loaded into the upper chamber of the spin filter, and the sample then was centrifuged at 12,000 × g to remove the solution. The proteins on the filter were washed with 200 μl of 1 m ammonium bicarbonate followed by centrifugation. The proteins then were suspended in 50 μl of 1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.4, containing 100 μm IAB or BMCC in 0.3% Me2SO (v/v). After incubation at 37 °C in the dark, the reaction was terminated by centrifugation to remove the buffer followed by an additional wash with 1 m NH4HCO3. The filtrates were discarded. The protein on the filter was suspended in 50 μl of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate containing 12 μl of 40 mm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (Pierce) and incubated at 50 °C for 15 min. Then 20 μl of 0.2 m iodoacetamide was added to the sample for 15 min to convert free thiols to carboxamidomethyl derivatives. Modified porcine sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) then was added in a 1:50 protein:trypsin ratio, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Tryptic peptides were collected by centrifugation through the filter at 5,000 × g, and the filtrate was acidified with 1 μl of concentrated formic acid for LC-MS-MS analyses.Affinity Capture and Digestion of FLAG-Keap1—Cytoplasmic protein fractions first were incubated with protein G-agarose (Sigma) in batch format for 3 h at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) overnight. After washing with nuclear lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl/150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6), the FLAG-Keap1 was eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in TBS buffer. Eluted proteins were concentrated with an Amicon ultracentrifugal filter device, 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Millipore) at 4,000 rpm and then reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin as described above.In-gel Digestion of Purified Keap1 Separated through SDS-PAGE— FLAG-Keap1 proteins were captured from cytoplasmic fractions as described above and then separated by electrophoresis on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad ready gel) and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen). Gel bands then were minced into 1-mm cubes, which were washed with 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Another 50 μlof 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the cut gel cubes, then 12 μl of 40 mm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine was added, and the samples were incubated at 50 °C for 15 min. Finally, 20 μlof0.2 m iodoacetamide was added to the sample for 15 min in the dark. The liquid was then removed and replaced with 30 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min. This step was repeated twice to further remove residual stain and reagents. The liquid was removed, and the gel cubes were desiccated in a vacuum centrifuge. The dehydrated gel cubes were then re-swelled in 20 μl of 0.01 μg/μl trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The digested peptides were then extracted twice from the gel with 40 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The extract then was evaporated by vacuum centrifugation, and the peptides were dissolved in 20 μl of 1% formic acid for LC-MS-MS analyses.LC-MS-MS Analyses—Peptide digests were analyzed on a Themo LTQ linear ion trap instrument equipped with a Thermo Surveyor LC system and microelectrospray source (Themo Electron). LC-MS-MS analyses were done by reverse phase chromatography on an 11-cm fused silica capillary column (100 μm inner diameter) packed with Monitor C-18 (5 μm) (Column Engineering) and eluted first with water/acetonitrile/formic acid (95:2:0.1, v/v/v) for 5 min. A linear gradient then increased acetonitrile to 30% by 28 min and 80% by 37 min and decreased acetonitrile to 7% by 40 min and then to 1% by 45 min. MS-MS spectra were acquired in data-dependent scanning mode with one full scan followed by one MS-MS scan on the most intense precursor with dynamic exclusion of previously selected precursors for a period of 3 min. MS-MS spectra were analyzed with TurboSequest (Thermo) with specification of carboxamidomethyl (+57 Da) or IAB adducts (+382.5 Da) as variable modifications.RESULTSIdentification of Keap1 Cysteine Residues Modified by Electrophiles in Vitro—In ongoing studies of the cellular effects of reactive electrophiles, we have employed biotin-tagged electrophiles (Fig. 1). These compounds display chemistries typical of a number of electrophilic metabolites of drugs and chemical and of endogenous electrophiles. To identify targets for electrophile adduction in Keap1, we used LC-MS-MS to analyze adducts formed with Keap1 in vitro. Treatment of His6-Keap1 with IAB at a molar ratio of 5 to 1 for 2 h at 37 °C yielded a total of 6 IAB-modified cysteines, each of which had a mass increase of 382.5, corresponding to IAB adducts (Table I, Supplemental Fig. 1). All of these cysteines (Cys-196, Cys-226, Cys-241, Cys-257, Cys-288, and Cys-319) are in the central linker domain, which is required for cytoplasmic sequestration of Nrf2 (17Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). For LC-MS-MS analyses, Keap1 protein was first reduced with tris(carboxyethylphosphine), and reduced cysteine thiols were alkylated with iodoacetamide to produce S-carboxamidomethyl derivatives. LC-MS-MS analyses routinely generated MS-MS spectra corresponding to ∼80% of the protein sequence. All of the cysteine-containing tryptic peptides were detected, except for Cys-151, Cys-395, and Cys-406. In analyses of electrophiletreated Keap1, cysteine-containing peptides were detected as S-carboxamidomethylated derivatives (corresponding to unadducted cysteines) or as electrophile-adducted cysteines (Table I). All adducts were characterized by mass shifts to b and/or y ions that confirmed sequence location of the adducts. MS-MS spectra of all adducts are presented as supplemental material (Supplemental Figs. 1–1 to 1–17).Table ISites of modification of Keap1 by electrophiles in vitro Human His6-Keap1 (1 nmol) was incubated with 100 μm electrophile (5-fold molar excess) for 2 h in 1 m ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C and then reduced, alkylated, and digested, and the peptides were analyzed by LC-MS-MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Empty cells indicate that the corresponding peptide was detected as the S-carboxamidomethyl derivative after reduction and alkylation with iodoacetamide.ResidueDomainaBTB, BTB domain; CL, central linker domain; Kelch, Kelch domain; CT, C-terminal domainIABBMCCCys-77BTB1,2,3bIndicates the experiment number in which adducted peptide was detectedCys-196CL1,2,31,2,3Cys-226CL1Cys-241CL1,2,3Cys-249CL3Cys-257CL1,3Cys-288CL1,2,3Cys-319CL2Cys-368Kelch1,2,3Cys-489Kelch1,2,3Cys-513KelchCys-518KelchCys-583KelchCys-622CTCys-624CTa BTB, BTB domain; CL, central linker domain; Kelch, Kelch domain; CT, C-terminal domainb Indicates the experiment number in which adducted peptide was detected Open table in a new tab A 2-h treatment of Keap1 with 100 μm IAB at a 5 to 1 molar ratio should be adequate for the critical reactive cysteines to be modified, since in our in vivo studies, Nrf2 was activated, and its downstream biological effects were observed within 2 h of electrophile treatment (see below). Longer exposure to IAB (4 and 6 h) resulted in alkylation of cysteines outside the central linker domain (Table II). These include cysteines in the BTB domain (Cys-77), in the Kelch repeat domain (Cys-368, Cys-489, Cys-518, and Cys-583) and in the C-terminal domain (Cys-622).Table IIModification of Keap1 by IAB as a function of time in vitro Human His6-keap1 (1 nmol) was incubated with 100 μm of IAB (5-fold molar excess) for 2 h in 1 m ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C and then reduced, alkylated, and digested, and the peptides were analyzed by LC-MS-MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Empty cells indicate that the corresponding peptide was detected as the S-carboxamidomethyl derivative after reduction and alkylation with iodoacetamide.ResidueDomainaBTB, BTB domain; CL, central linker domain; Kelch, Kelch domain; CT, C-terminal domainIAB treatment2 h4 h6 hCys-77BTB1,3bIndicates experiment number in which adducted peptide was detected1,2,3Cys-196CL1,2,31,2,31,2,3Cys-226CL11,2,31,2,3Cys-241CL1,2,31,2,31,2,3Cys-249CL1Cys-257CL1,31,2,31,2,3Cys-288CL1,2,31,2,31,2,3Cys-319CL21,2,31,2,3Cys-368Kelch1,2,31,2,3Cys-489Kelch1,2,31,2,3Cys-513Kelch3Cys-518Kelch1,2,3Cys-583Kelch1,2,31,2,3Cys-622CT1,2,31,2,3Cys-624CT1,2,3a BTB, BTB domain; CL, central linker domain; Kelch, Kelch domain; CT, C-terminal domainb Indicates experiment number in which adducted peptide was detected Open table in a new tab The biotin-tagged N-alkylmaleimide BMCC displayed a very different pattern of alkylation than IAB. At 37 °C and at a molar ratio of 5 to 1, BMCC modified 5 cysteines, including Cys-196 and Cys-249 in the central linker domain Cys-77 in the BTB domain and Cys-368 and Cys-489 in the C-terminal Kelch repeat domain (Table I). The only residue attacked by both BMCC and IAB is Cys-196. Thus, the results shown in Table I indicate that Keap1 cysteines exhibit different chemical reactivity toward the two electrophiles.IAB and BMCC Produce Differential Nrf2 Activation in Vivo—IAB was modestly toxic to HEK293 cells, as measured by the lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay, and 100 μm IAB induced <5% lactate dehydrogenase leakage at 4 h. Treatment of ARE/thymidine kinase green fluorescent protein-transfected HepG2 cells with 100 μm IAB for 2 h at 37 °C increased ARE-directed green fluorescent protein expression 2.78-fold (Supplemental Fig. 2), which was similar to the induction by the known ARE activator tBHQ (3.72-fold) and which demonstrated that IAB can induce expression of ARE-driven genes. Furthermore, a 2-h treatment of HEK293 cells with 100 μm IAB induced the accumulation of nuclear Nrf2 and increased the expression of HO-1 protein (Supplemental Fig. 2). Purity of cytosolic and nuclear extracts was established by Western blotting for glutathione-S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 3).To further examine the interplay of electrophiles with the Keap1-Nrf2 system, we generated HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-Keap1 (Supplemental Fig. 4). Treatment of FLAG-Keap1-transfected cells with 100 μm IAB for 2 h at 37 °C resulted in a robust induction of nuclear Nrf2 as well as increased expression of HO-1 (Fig. 2). tBHQ also induced nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and induction of HO-1 protein. In contrast, neither nuclear Nrf2 accumulation nor expression of HO-1 protein was affected by a 2-h BMCC treatment. This result suggests that IAB but not BMCC can induce Keap1-Nrf2 dissociation, nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and Nrf2-mediated expression of HO-1.Fig. 2Effect of IAB, BMCC, and tBHQ on nuclear Nrf2 and cytosolic HO-1 protein levels. Cells stably expressing FLAG-Keap1 were treated with 100 μm IAB, BMCC, or tBHQ, and nuclear and cytosolic protein fractions were prepared. Nuclear proteins from each sample (20 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Nrf2 antibody. Cytoplasmic proteins (20 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HO1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Differential Effects of IAB and BMCC on Formation of High Molecular Weight Keap1 Forms in Vivo—FLAG-Keap1-transfected cells were treated with 100 μm IAB for 2 h at 37 °C, and FLAG-Keap1 proteins were captured with anti-FLAG antibodies and analyzed on reducing SDS-PAGE gels. The majority of the Keap1 protein from IAB-treated cells migrated in a series of high molecular weight (HMW) bands with a molecular mass of greater than 150 kDa, whereas the Keap1 protein from untreated cells migrated with an observed molecular mass of 70 kDa, which corresponds to the Keap1 monomer (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin indicated intense ubiquitin immunoreactivity co-migrating with the HMW Keap1 protein bands from IAB-treated cells but not from controls (Fig. 3C). HMW Keap1 forms were not observed in cells treated with 100 μm BMCC (Fig. 3, D–F) nor was anti-ubiquitin immunoreactivity detected. The HMW Keap1 protein forms were detected under reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE (15 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the loading buffer). Pretreatment of the samples with 8 m urea, reduction with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and alkylation of the reduced protein with iodoacetamide before SDS-PAGE failed to alter the migration of the HMW Keap1 products (data no"

Keap1 targets its substrate, the Nrf2 transcription factor, for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Inhibition of Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2 increases steady-state levels of Nrf2 and enables activation of cytoprotective Nrf2-dependent genes. In this report, we demonstrate that Keap1 and three other BTB-Kelch proteins, including GAN1, ENC1, and Sarcosin, are ubiquitinated by a Cul3-dependent complex. Ubiquitination of Keap1 is markedly increased in cells exposed to quinone-induced oxidative stress, occurs in parallel with inhibition of Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2, and results in decreased steady-state levels of Keap1, particularly in cells that are unable to synthesize glutathione. Degradation of Keap1 is independent of the 26 S proteasome, because inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome do not prevent loss of Keap1 following exposure of cells to quinone-induced oxidative stress. Our results suggest that a switch from substrate to substrate adaptor ubiquitination is a critical regulatory step that controls steady-state levels of both BTB-Kelch substrate adaptor proteins and their cognate substrates.

The induction of proteins that increase the anti-oxidant capacity of cells and enable restoration of intracellular redox homeostasis is a major protective mechanism against the damaging consequences of oxidative stress. The expression of many anti-oxidant and cytoprotective proteins, including classic phase 2 detoxification enzymes, chaperone proteins, anti-oxidant proteins, and proteins in the proteasomal degradation pathway, is regulated by Nrf2, a bZIP transcription factor (6Kwak M.K.

The N-terminal BTB domain and central linker region of Keap1 bind Cul3, whereas the C-terminal Kelch domain of Keap1 binds Nrf2 via residues located within loops that extend out from the bottom of the Kelch domain (20Kobayashi A.

Under conditions of homeostatic cell growth, Keap1 brings Nrf2 into the Cul3-Rbx1 complex and enables ubiquitin conjugation onto specific lysine residues located within the N-terminal Neh2 domain of Nrf2 (21Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10941-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). However, following exposure of cells to a wide variety of chemical inducers of Nrf2-dependent transcription, Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2 is blocked, enabling Nrf2 to accumulate in the nucleus and activate expression of Nrf2-dependent genes (21Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10941-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 24Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The molecular definition of Keap1 as a substrate adaptor protein for Cul3 provides a conceptual framework for understanding how Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2 is regulated. In general, the six cullin proteins encoded by the human genome function as scaffold proteins that bring together a substrate protein and a ubiquitin-charged E2 ubiquitin conjugation (Ubc) protein (25Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar, 26Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The E2 protein does not associate directly with the cullin protein but is brought into the complex by the cullin-associated Rbx1 protein. Likewise, the substrate does not typically associate directly with the cullin protein but is brought into the complex by a substrate adaptor protein. Once the entire E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is assembled, the ubiquitin molecule is transferred from a conserved cysteine residue in the Ubc protein to one or more lysine residues in the substrate protein. Cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligases typically catalyze the addition of a multiubiquitin chain onto the substrate protein and thereby target the substrate protein for proteasome-mediated degradation. Cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes are dynamic complexes that undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly (27Cope G.A. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 28Wolf D.A. Zhou C. Wee S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The ability of cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes to undergo facile substrate adaptor exchange is a critical functional property, because each cullin protein supports the ability of a large number of substrate adaptor proteins to target their substrates for degradation. Several mechanisms have been suggested to account for facile exchange of substrate adaptor proteins by cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. In yeast, several well characterized F-box-containing substrate adaptor proteins, including Grr1, cdc4p, and Met30, all of which function as substrate adaptors for Cul1, are labile proteins that are subject to auto-ubiquitination by the same Cul1-Rbx1 complex that directs ubiquitination of their substrates (29Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because F-box proteins play critical roles in the cell cycle and in the response of cells to environmental conditions, rapid degradation of a specific substrate adaptor protein may enable timely accumulation of its substrate protein. Rapid degradation of a substrate adaptor protein will also minimize competition for limiting amounts of the cullin-Rbx1 complex and provides a mechanism for substrate adaptor exchange (27Cope G.A. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, which contain numerous substrate adaptor proteins that specifically utilize individual cullin proteins, only two F-box proteins, Skp2 and βTrCP, are known to be regulated at the level of ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (31Li Y.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5362-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms have been uncovered that contribute to substrate adaptor exchange in mammalian cells. For example, the CAND1 protein has been proposed to displace a substrate adaptor protein from Cul1 following deneddylation of the Cul1 protein by the COP9 signalosome (28Wolf D.A. Zhou C. Wee S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 35Liu J. Furukawa M. Matsumoto T. Xiong Y. Mol.

In this report, we demonstrate that Keap1 is ubiquitinated in vivo and in vitro by the same Cul3-Rbx1 complex that ubiquitinates its substrate, Nrf2. Other members of the BTB-Kelch protein family are also able to assemble into functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes with Cul3 that support ubiquitination of the respective BTB-Kelch protein, providing evidence that the ability to function as a substrate adaptor protein for Cul3 is a conserved property of this large family of proteins. Quinone-induced oxidative stress enhances ubiquitination of Keap1 and decreases steady-state levels of Keap1, resulting in a corresponding increase in steady-state levels of Nrf2. However, in contrast to Nrf2 degradation, which is blocked by inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome, proteasome inhibitors do not block degradation of Keap1. Keap1 ubiquitination and proteasome-independent degradation of Keap1 following exposure to quinone-induced oxidative stress is markedly enhanced in glutathione-deficient cells. The isothiocyanate sulforaphane, a well characterized cancer-preventive inducer of Nrf2-dependent transcription, inhibits Keap1-dependent ubiquitination of Nrf2 but does not induce Keap1 ubiquitination, indicating that Keap1 differentially responds to inducers of Nrf2-dependent transcription. Our results indicate that ubiquitination targets BTB-Kelch proteins for degradation by a proteasome-independent pathway and suggest that a switch from substrate to substrate adaptor ubiquitination is a critical regulatory step that controls steady-state levels of both BTB-Kelch substrate adaptor proteins and their cognate substrates. Construction of Recombinant DNA Molecules—Plasmids expressing wild type Keap1, Nrf2, Cul3, Cul3DN, Rbx1, and HA-Ub proteins have been previously described (21Zhang D.D. Lo S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10941-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). cDNA clones of GAN1, ENC1, and sarcosin were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). The CBD-tagged versions of GAN1, ENC1, and sarcosin were generated by insertion of a PCR-generated DNA fragment encoding the chitin binding domain of Bacillus circulans chitinase A1 gene upstream of the stop codon. The integrity of all of the plasmids used in this study was confirmed by sequence analysis. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells were purchased from ATCC. Cells were maintained in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Eagle's minimal essential medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. GCS-2 cells were grown in knockout Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% ES-cell qualified bovine serum, 2.5 mm glutathione, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—The anti-Keap1 antibody has been described previously (24Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Nrf2 and Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ubiquitin (Sigma), chitin binding domain (New England Biolabs), and HA (Covance) were purchased from commercial sources. For detection of protein expression in total cell lysates, cells were lysed in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm DTT, 0.1% bromphenol blue) at 48 h post-transfection. For immunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein A beads and incubated with 2 μg of affinity-purified antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed four times with RIPA buffer and eluted in sample buffer by boiling for 4 min, electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In Vivo Ubiquitination—For detection of ubiquitinated proteins in vivo, cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-ubiquitin and the indicated proteins. Expression vectors for HA-Cul3 and Myc-Rbx1 were included in some of experiments, as indicated. Cells were rapidly lysed by boiling in a buffer containing 2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm DTT. This rapid lysis procedure inactivates cellular ubiquitin hydrolases and therefore preserves ubiquitin-protein conjugates present in cells prior to lysis. Protein-protein interactions, including association of Nrf2 with Keap1, are also disrupted by this lysis procedure. For immunoprecipitation, these lysates were diluted 5-fold in buffer lacking SDS and incubated with anti-Keap1, anti-Nrf2, or anti-CBD antibodies accordingly. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies directed against the HA epitope. In Vitro Ubiquitination—For ubiquitination of the BTB-Kelch proteins in vitro, COS-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for the individual CBD-tagged BTB-Kelch protein, HA-Cul3, and Myc-Rbx1. The transfected cells were lysed in buffer B (15 mm Tris-HCL (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.25% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were pre-cleared with protein A beads prior to incubation with chitin beads (New England Biolabs) for 4 h at 4 °C. Chitin beads were washed twice with buffer B, twice with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1 m NaCl), and twice with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, and 0.6 mm DTT). The pellets were incubated with ubiquitin (300 pmol), E1 (2 pmol), E2-UbcH5a (10 pmol), and ATP (2 mm) in 1× reaction buffer in a total volume of 30 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. Ubiquitin, E1, and E2-UbcH5a were purchased from Boston Biochem. The chitin beads were centrifuged at 3000 × g, resuspended in 2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm DTT and boiled for 5 min to release bound proteins, inactivate any contaminating ubiquitin hydrolases, and disrupt protein-protein interactions. The supernatant was diluted 5-fold with buffer lacking SDS prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-CBD antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Assembly into a Functional Ubiquitin Ligase Complex Is a Conserved Property of BTB-Kelch Proteins—The major function of substrate adaptor proteins is to target specific substrate proteins for ubiquitination. However, ubiquitination of substrate adaptor proteins may also play an important role in cellular physiology. For example, auto-ubiquitination of several yeast F-box proteins is responsible for their rapid turnover during progression through the cell cycle (29Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that Keap1 is ubiquitinated by a Cul3-Rbx1 complex in vitro, the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 complex was purified from COS-1 cells transfected with expression vectors for Keap1, Cul3, and Rbx1. To facilitate purification of Keap1 and Keap1-associated proteins, an expression vector encoding a Keap1 protein containing a C-terminal chitin binding domain (CBD) was utilized in this experiment. Proteins that bound to the chitin beads were incubated with purified E1, E2-UbcH5a, ubiquitin, and ATP. Subsequently, anti-Keap1 immunoprecipitates were prepared under strongly denaturing conditions and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Fig. 1A, top panel). Keap1-ubiquitin conjugates were readily observed in the presence of both Cul3 and Rbx1 (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 5), and required the addition of ubiquitin, E1, and E2-UbcH5a to the in vitro reaction (Fig. 2C, top panel, lanes 2–4). Immunoblot analysis of anti-Keap1 immunoprecipitates confirmed the presence of equivalent levels of Keap1-CBD in all reactions (Fig. 1A, bottom panel).Fig. 2A, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-ubiquitin, Keap1, and HA-Cul3 and increasing amounts of an expression vector for Rbx1. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions and subjected to immunoblot analysis with Keap1 antibodies (bottom panel). Equivalent aliquots of each lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Keap1 antibodies. Anti-Keap1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-HA antibodies (top panel). B, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-ubiquitin and Keap1. Total lysates (left panel) or anti-HA immunoprecipitates (right panel) were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-Keap1 antibodies. The samples were analyzed in parallel on adjacent lanes. The left panel was exposed for a shorter time than the right panel. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-ubiquitin and Keap1 and the expression vector for either Cul3 or Cul3DN. Cells were either left untreated or treated with 10 μm MG132 for 4 h prior to lysis. Equivalent aliquots of each lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-Keap1 antibodies (bottom panel) or subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Keap1 antibodies. Anti-Keap1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-HA antibodies (top panel). D, cell lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with expression vectors for Keap1 and the indicated wild-type or mutant HA-ubiquitin proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Keap1 antibodies. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-HA antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Keap1 is one of more than 40 BTB-Kelch proteins that are encoded by the human genome (18Prag S.

The members of the BTB-Kelch family share both a common domain organization and ∼25% sequence identity, when compared on a one-to-one basis with each other. The biochemical functions of this family of proteins are, in general, not known, although the ability of Keap1 to function as a substrate adaptor protein suggests a common function for these proteins. To determine if other BTB-Kelch proteins may function as substrate adaptor proteins for Cul3, the ability of several different BTB-Kelch proteins to associate with Cul3 and Rbx1 to form a functional ubiquitin ligase complex was determined. The three BTB-Kelch proteins used for these experiments, GAN1, ENC1, and sarcosin, were selected because of their known or suspected roles in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (39Bomont P.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification and detection of these BTB-Kelch proteins, fusion proteins containing a CBD were constructed. Expression vectors for the CBD-tagged BTB-Kelch proteins were transfected into COS-1 cells alone or with expression vectors for HA-Cul3 and Myc-Rbx1. Cell lysates were subjected to affinity purification using chitin beads. Neither Cul3 nor Rbx1 purified with the chitin beads in the absence of a CBD-tagged BTB-Kelch protein (Fig. 1B). Each of these BTB-Kelch proteins was able to associate with both Cul3 and Rbx1, as determined by immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes using anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 1C, middle and bottom panels, respectively). The ability of the complexes formed between the respective BTB-Kelch proteins, Cul3 and Rbx1, to support ubiquitin conjugation onto the BTB-Kelch protein was determined. The chitin beads containing the purified complexes were incubated with E1, E2-UbcH5a, ubiquitin, and ATP. Subsequently, anti-CBD immunoprecipitates prepared under strongly denaturing conditions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Ubiquitin conjugation, onto each of the BTB-Kelch proteins that was dependent upon the addition of E1 into the in vitro reaction, was observed (Fig. 1D). The presence of ubiquitin conjugation onto Keap1 and GAN1 in the absence of co-expressed Cul3 and Rbx1 proteins presumably represents co-purification of endogenous Cul3 and Rbx1 proteins with these two BTB-Kelch proteins (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 6). Keap1 Is Ubiquitinated by a Cul3-Rbx1 Complex in Vivo—To determine if Keap1 is ubiquitinated in vivo, MDA-MB-231 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for HA-ubiquitin, HA-Cul3, and Keap1 and increasing amounts of the expression vector for Myc-Rbx1. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions and subjected to immunoprecipitation with Keap1 antibodies. The presence of ubiquitin-conjugated Keap1 proteins was assessed by immunoblot analysis of anti-Keap1 immunoprecipitates with anti-HA antibodies. Ubiquitin conjugation onto ectopically expressed Keap1 was readily observed and was increased by coexpression of Cul3 (Fig. 2A, top panel, lanes 1–3). Low levels of co-expressed Rbx1 slightly increased the levels of ubiquitin conjugation onto Keap1 (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 4). Increased Rbx1 expression did not further increase Keap1 ubiquitination, but markedly decreased steady-state levels of Keap1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). To confirm that Keap1 is ubiquitinated in vivo, cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with expression vectors for Keap1 and HA-ubiquitin were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. The presence of Keap1 in anti-HA immunoprecipitates was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Keap1 antibodies (Fig. 2B). To define the role of Cul3 in ubiquitination of Keap1 in vivo, we determined the ability of a dominant-negative Cul3 protein lacking the C-terminal Rbx1 binding domain to block Keap1 ubiquitination. Cell lysates were collected from MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with expression vectors for Keap1 and either wild-type or dominant-negative Cul3. As expected, co-expression of Keap1 with the wild-type Cul3 protein increased ubiquitination onto Keap1 (Fig. 2C, top panel, lanes 3–6). Co-expression of Keap1 with the dominant-negative Cul3 protein decreased levels of ubiquitin-conjugated Keap1 (Fig. 2C, top panel, lanes 7 and 8). Treatment of the transfected cells with MG132 prior to collection of cell lysates enhanced ubiquitin conjugation onto Keap1 (Fig. 2C, top panel, compare even and odd lanes) but did not alter steady-state levels of Keap1 (Fig. 2C, bottom panel, compare even and odd lanes). Taken together, these results indicate that ubiquitination of Keap1 is mediated by"

Nonetheless, the specific mitochondrial defects due to the presence of mutant huntingtin have not been fully elucidated. To determine the effects of mutant huntingtin on mitochondrial energy production, a thorough analysis of respiration, ATP production, and functioning of the respiratory complexes was carried out in clonal striatal cells established from HdhQ7 (wild-type) and HdhQ111 (mutant huntingtin knock-in) mouse embryos. Mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were significantly reduced in the mutant striatal cells compared with the wild-type cells when either glutamate/malate or succinate was used as the substrate. However, mitochondrial respiration was similar in the two cell lines when the artificial electron donor TMPD/ascorbate, which feeds into complex IV, was used as the substrate. The attenuation of mitochondrial respiration and ATP production when either glutamate/malate or succinate was used as the substrate was not due to impairment of the respiratory complexes, because their activities were equivalent in both cell lines. Intriguingly, in the striatum of presymptomatic and pathological grade 1 Huntington disease cases there is also no impairment of mitochondrial complexes I–IV (Guidetti, P., Charles, V., Chen, E. Y., Reddy, P. H., Kordower, J. H., Whetsell, W. O., Jr., Schwarcz, R., and Tagle, D. A. (2001) Exp. Neurol. 169, 340–350). To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the effects of physiological levels of mutant huntingtin on mitochondrial respiratory function within an appropriate cellular context. These findings demonstrate that the presence of mutant huntingtin impairs mitochondrial ATP production through one or more mechanisms that do not directly affect the function of the respiration complexes."

Gene silencing of AIF with its small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed cisplatin-induced AIF expression and provided a marked protection against cell death. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence studies revealed cisplatin-induced translocation of AIF from the mitochondria to the nuclei. Pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone or p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α markedly prevented mitochondrial release of AIF, suggesting that caspases and p53 are involved in this release. Caspase-2 and -3 that were predominantly activated in response to cisplatin provided a unique model to study the role of these caspases in AIF release. Cisplatin-treated caspase-3 (+/+) and caspase-3 (-/-) cells exhibited similar AIF translocation to the nuclei, suggesting that caspase-3 does not affect AIF translocation, and thus, caspase-2 may be involved in the translocation. Caspase-2 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone or down-regulation of caspase-2 by its siRNA significantly prevented translocation of AIF. Caspase-2 activation was a critical response from p53, which was markedly induced and phosphorylated in cisplatin-treated cells. Overexpression of p53 not only resulted in caspase-2 activation but also mitochondrial release of AIF. The p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α or p53 siRNA prevented both cisplatin-induced caspase-2 activation and mitochondrial release of AIF. Caspase-2 activation was dependent on the p53-responsive gene, PIDD, a death domain-containing protein that was induced by cisplatin in a p53-dependent manner. These results suggest that caspase-2 activation mediated by p53 is an important pathway involved in the mitochondrial release of AIF in response to cisplatin injury.

In response to a specific apoptotic stimulus, AIF is translocated to the cytosol and then to the nucleus. When in the nucleus, AIF associates with chromatin (3Ye H. Cande C. Stephanou N.C. Jiang S.

In addition to its endonuclease function in apoptosis, AIF has NADH oxidase activity confined to the mitochondria in normal cells (1Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Recently, AIF has also been shown to participate in the respiratory chain complex I activity (6Vahsen N. Cande C. Briere J.J. Benit P. Joza N. Larochette N. Mastroberardino P.G. Pequignot M.O. Casares N. Lazar V. Feraud O. Debili N. Wissing S. Engelhardt S. Madeo F. Piacentini M. Penninger J.M. Schagger H. Rustin P.

Overexpression of recombinant AIF by transient transfection, microinjection, or adenoviral infection results in chromatinolysis and cell death without caspase activation (1Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K.

However, the question of whether the release of mitochondrial AIF into the cytosol and the nucleus is dependent on caspase activation is not fully resolved. The release of AIF has been shown to be caspase-independent in some cell types (9Cande C. Vahsen N. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These studies were supported by the evidence that caspase inhibitors (10Cregan S.P. Fortin A. MacLaurin J.G.

These studies suggest that AIF translocation is independent of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation in these cells. However, recent evidence has also suggested the role of caspases in the mitochondrial release of AIF. Mitochondrial release of AIF was blocked by pancaspase inhibitor in HeLa and Jurkat cells treated with staurosporine or actinomycin D (13Arnoult D. Tatischeff I. Estaquier J. Girard M. Sureau F.

Antonsson B. Estaquier J. Ameisen J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In response to an apoptotic stimulus, many mitochondrial intermembrane proteins including cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, Omi/HtrA2, endonuclease G, and AIF are released upon permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Although proapoptotic molecules of the Bcl-2 family can regulate the mitochondrial permeabilization (15Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 16Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar), little is known on the mechanism and the temporal sequence of the release of the mitochondrial intermembrane proteins. Recent evidence showed that the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization induced by Bax/Bak or tBid resulted in selective release of cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and Omi/HtrA2 (14Arnoult D. Parone P.

Parone P. Martinou J.C. Antonsson B. Estaquier J. Ameisen J.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The identity of caspase involved in the release of AIF was not determined in these studies. Nephrotoxicity is one of the major side effects when the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin is used for the treatment of solid tumors of a wide range of tissues (18Rozencweig M. von Hoff D.D. Slavik M.

However, the mechanism of cisplatin-induced mitochondrial release of AIF and the role of caspases in its release is not known. We have recently demonstrated a marked increase in cisplatin-induced caspase-3 and -2 activation in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) (39Kaushal G.P. Kaushal V. Hong X. Shah S.V. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 1726-1736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This study in RTEC provided a unique model to examine the role of caspase-2 and -3 in the mitochondrial release of AIF. Thus, in the present study, we have explored cisplatin-induced release of mitochondrial AIF to the cytosol and the nucleus and the role of caspases in this process. We provide evidence that cisplatin-induced caspase-2 activation but not caspase-3 activation is involved in the mitochondrial release of AIF. We have further explored the mechanism of caspase-2 activation and demonstrated the role of p53 and its responsive gene p53-induced death domain protein (PIDD) on caspase-2 activation that participates in the subsequent release of mitochondrial AIF in RTEC. LLC-PK1 cells obtained from ATCC were cultured as described in our previous studies (39Kaushal G.P. Kaushal V. Hong X. Shah S.V. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 1726-1736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Gibco medium 199 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C and fed with fresh medium at intervals of 48-72 h. Experiments were performed with cells grown to 80% confluence. Caspase substrates were purchased from Peptide International (Louisville, KY), and antibodies to caspase-3, AIF, histone H1A, α-tubulin, β-actin, and proteins of the Bcl-2 family were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) Antibodies to p53, Ser-15-phosphorylated p53, and active caspase-3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibody to cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Caspase inhibitors, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VDVAD-fmk), and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone were obtained from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA). The cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing serum, and cells were incubated either without or with cisplatin at various concentrations (25-200 μm) for the period of time indicated (1-24 h). In initial studies, we determined the optimum exposure time and the suitable concentration of cisplatin. To determine the effect of inhibitors, cells were treated with the inhibitors for 10 min prior to the addition of cisplatin (50 μm). Primary cultures of RTEC were prepared from caspase-3 (-/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice. Caspase-3 (-/-) mice were generously provided by Richard Flavell, Ph.D. All procedures for the preparation of primary cultures were performed under sterile conditions as described (40Bergin E. Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F758-F768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, renal cortices were minced and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase and 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for 30 min. After the removal of large, undigested fragments by gravity, the cell suspension was washed first with Hanks' solution containing 10% horse serum and then with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were suspended in growth medium containing a serum-free mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12 (1:1), 2 mm glutamine, 15 mm HEPES, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 50 mm hydrocortisone, 500 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells previously isolated by this procedure were identified as being predominantly of proximal tubular origin (41Sheridan A.M. Schwartz J.H. Kroshian V.M. Tercyak A.M. Masino S. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F342-F350PubMed Google Scholar). The cell suspension was then plated into tissue culture flasks. After 24 h, the mono-layers were washed several times to remove unattached cells, and new growth medium was added. The cultures became confluent in 5-7 days. Isolation of Nuclear Fraction—The nuclei were prepared by a minor modification of the previously described procedure (42Wood E.R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2839-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells were gently scraped using the rubber policeman, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with PBS. The cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma); and homogenized with 30-35 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton). To establish the number of stokes for cell permeabilization, the trypan blue exclusion method (0.4% trypan blue solution in PBS diluted 1:10 with cell suspension), which discriminates between permeabilized (stained) cells and intact cells (unstained), was used. The suspension was then transferred to Eppendorf centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The nuclear fraction was adjusted to the final concentration of 0.25 m sucrose and 0.35% Triton X-100 and layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient prepared with 0.32, 0.8, and 1.2 m sucrose in a Beckman centrifuge. The tubes were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 2 h. The nuclei were recovered at the interface of 0.8 m and 1.2 m sucrose. Samples were stored at -70 °C before being used for Western blot analysis. Isolation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation essentially as described (43Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and resuspended in isotonic homogenization buffer supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cells were broken with 30-35 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton), and the suspension was centrifuged at 2,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer and layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 20 ml of 1.2 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin on top of 17 ml of 1.6 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The samples were centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SW28 rotor. Mitochondria recovered at the 1.6-1.2 m sucrose interface were washed and resuspended in homogenization buffer. This procedure results in the mitochondrial preparation with very little contamination of other organelles. Contamination of mitochondria in the nuclear fraction was determined by immunoblotting for cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, an integral membrane protein of the mitochondria. Cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips and treated with cisplatin for various time points in the presence and absence of inhibitors. Following treatments, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washing twice in PBS, the cells were permeabilized for 1 h in blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum, 0.1% saponin, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm NaV2O5 in PBS. The cells were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-AIF antibody (1:200) and rabbit anti-caspase-3 (active) antibody (1:200) for 1 h in a 37 °C humidified incubator. After three washes in washing buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin in PBS, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 for AIF and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 for caspase-3) in blocking solution and again washed with washing buffer. The nuclei were stained with 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min, and the cells were washed twice in washing buffer. Coverslips were then mounted on slides using antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Localization of active caspase-3 and morphological changes of the nuclei were analyzed using a Zeiss deconvoluted microscope. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed in cold PBS twice. The washed cell pellets were lysed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A at 4 °C. The supernatants obtained were used to determine the activities of caspase-2 and -3 by fluorometric assay using the following amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-tagged substrates: VDVAD-AMC for caspase-2 and DEVD-AMC for caspase-3 (45Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme extracts containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm caspase substrate in a total reaction volume of 0.25 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, the amount of liberated fluorescent group, AMC, was determined using a fluorescent spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. AMC was used as a standard. Based on the standard curve made with fluorescence reading with free AMC, the data for caspase activity are expressed as nmol of AMC liberated when 50 μg of protein extract was incubated with 50 μm of substrate for 60 min at 30 °C. The cell lysates were prepared as described above for the caspase assay, and equal amounts of protein samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 8% polyacrylamide gels as previously described (44Kaushal G.P. Singh A.B. Shah S.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F587-F595PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a Transblot membrane (Bio-Rad), processed for immunoblotting with specific antibodies, and detected using the ECL system as previously described (39Kaushal G.P. Kaushal V. Hong X. Shah S.V. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 1726-1736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying p53, green fluorescent protein, lacZ, and AIF were generous gifts from Dr Ruth S. Slack. The amplification of packaged adenovirus was achieved by infection of HEK 293 cells. Adenoviruses were released from the cells by repeated freezing and thawing of the cells, and a titer of 1.1 × 1012 plaque-forming units/ml was produced. The adenoviral infectivity titers for LLC-PK1 cells were determined using procedures as described (46Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J. Gendron T.F. Callaghan S.M. Park D.S. Parks R.J. Graham F.L. Morley P. Slack R.S. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells growing at 70-80% confluence were infected with adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell. The presence of the recombinant adenovirus was confirmed by Western blot. When the adenovirus was used for the experiment, the efficiency of the infection was confirmed by contransfection of Ad-GFP or Ad-LacZ followed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining for β-galactosidase expression. The cells were infected with adenovirus p53 or transfected with p53 small interfering RNA (siRNA) 36 h prior to the treatment of cisplatin. Total RNA from the cultured cells was obtained by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Approximately 1 μg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription. The expression levels of various genes were determined by reverse transcription-PCR. The following primer pairs were used for amplifying gene-specific amplicons: GGAAGCTCAGGATGTTCGAG-3′ and the complementary downstream primer 5′-GTTTCTGCATCACCCAGGTT-3′ for PIDD, 5′-CAGCTCCAAGAGGTTTTTCG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCATCACTCTCCTCACA-3′ for caspase-2, and 5′-AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC-3′ and downstream primer 5′-TCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAAG-3′ for β-actin used as an internal control. To ensure that the PCR had not reached a saturation point that would skew the quantitation, aliquots were removed after certain cycle numbers and analyzed in series on an agarose gel. Then the minimum cycle that initially gives optimal product was used in the experiment. LLCPK1 cells were plated in a 6-well plate with complete medium. When the cells were 60% confluent, old medium was replaced with fresh medium without serum and antibiotics. siRNAs were designed or obtained from commercial sources to interfere with the expression of AIF, p53, and caspase-2. AIF siRNA sequence 5′-AUGCAGAACUCCAAGCACGTT-3′ (sense strand) was designed using online software (BLOCK-iT™ RNAi Designer from Invitrogen). Commercially available siRNAs for AIF, caspase 2, p53, and AIF from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) were also used in this study according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Lipofectamine (10 μl) and siRNA (10 pmol in 10 μl) in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The cells in each well were then transfected with this mixture. After 12 h, fetal bovine serum was added to a final concentration of 10%, and on day 2, the medium in the cells was replaced with fresh medium before cisplatin treatment. Cells (5,000/well) were plated in 96-well dishes and treated with 25 μm caspase inhibitors (Z-VAD-fmk or Z-VDVAD-fmk) or p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α prior to the treatment with 50 μm cisplatin. Inhibition of cell proliferation was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the detection of apoptosis, cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates. The cells were treated with caspase inhibitors or pifithrin-α for 1 h prior to treatment with 50 μm cisplatin for 12 h. Apoptosis was detected on the basis of nuclear morphology. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI to reveal f"

Angiogenesis, the outgrowth of new vessels from preexisting blood vessels, is an important feature of both normal physiology and pathologic states including chronic inflammatory diseases and tumor development (1Jain R.K.

The growth factor VEGF-A 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; KLF, Kruppel-like factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; EGM, endothelial growth medium; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; Ad, adenovirus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2. is a key regulator of physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis (4Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). Originally identified on the basis of its ability to induce vascular permeability (5Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3428) Google Scholar), VEGF-A is now recognized as a potent inducer of endothelial proliferation, migration, and survival. Furthermore, VEGF-A also acts as a proinflammatory cytokine and induces the expression of a number of molecules implicated in regulating angiogenesis such specific enzymes (e.g. cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)), adhesion molecules (e.g. E-selectin, VCAM-1) (6Kim I.

Koh G.Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 126-128PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of VEGF-A and its family members are mediated by three structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases termed VEGFR1/Flt-1, VEGFR2/KDR/Flk-1, and VEGFR3/Flt4 (8Shibuya M. Yamaguchi S.

Science's STKE. 2001; 2001: RE21Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Among these three receptors, VEGFR2 has emerged as the main receptor mediating VEGF-A effects related to angiogenesis such as endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and proinflammatory activation. In contrast, VEGFR1 is thought to mediate inhibitory and/or decoy effects (14Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar) (15Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) in vascular endothelial cells. Finally, VEGFR3 is mainly expressed in lymphatics and regulates aspects of lymphatic endothelial cell biology (13Matsumoto T. Claesson-Welsh L. Science's STKE. 2001; 2001: RE21Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The importance of VEGF-A/VEGFR2 axis is further underscored by the fact that both ligand and receptor levels is increased in pathologic states such as tumor beds (16Plate K.H. Breier G. Millauer B. Ullrich A. Risau W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5822-5827PubMed Google Scholar, 17Brown L.F. Berse B. Jackman R.W. Tognazzi K. Manseau E.J. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Am. J.

It follows that identification of mechanisms that may reduce the expression of either ligand or receptor may serve as the basis for inhibiting angiogenesis in pathologic states. The Sp/Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family of transcription factors is a subclass of the zinc-finger family of transcriptional regulators implicated in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation (21Feinberg M.W. Lin Z. Fisch S. Jain M.K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To date 20 members have been identified that include 4 Sp factors (Sp1–4) and 16 KLF factors (KLF1–16) (22Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Members of this family can bind with varying affinities to the same DNA sequences (termed GC-box or CACCC element) and varying transcriptional activities. Furthermore, members of this family can modulate each other's function through a number of distinct mechanisms such as regulating each other's expression or through direct interaction (22Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 23Zhang W. Shields J.M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), is strongly expressed in endothelial cells and required for normal vessel formation (26Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). More recently, our group has provided evidence that KLF2 regulates endothelial gene expression and pro-inflammatory activation (27SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Luscinskas F.W. Michel T.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Jain M.K. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Lin Z.

These studies demonstrate that overexpression of KLF2 can strongly attenuate the cytokine-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory targets such as VCAM-1, E-selectin, and tissue factor (27SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Luscinskas F.W. Michel T.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Jain M.K. J. Exp.

In this study we provide evidence that KLF2 strongly inhibits VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis via a reduction in VEGFR2 expression and promoter activity. Reagents—VEGF165 and bFGF were obtained from R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN. [3H]Thymidine was from Amersham Biosciences. The antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-VEGFR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CD34 (Abcam), and anti-GFP (CLONTECH). Cell Proliferation Assay—HUVECs (2 × 104) were seeded in 24-well plates cultured for 24 h in EGM. Ad-KLF2 or empty vector (10 m.o.i.) was added, and after 24 h the cells were serum-starved (0.1% serum) overnight and then treated with VEGF165 (10 ng/ml). After culture for 20 h, 1 mCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well, and 4 h later, cells were washed with chilled in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 100% cold methanol, and collected for the measurement of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity (29Basu S. Nagy J.A. Pal S. Vasile E. Eckelhoefer I.A. Bliss V.S. Manseau E.J. Dasgupta P.S. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 30Zeng H.

Western Blot Analysis—HUVECs were cultured in EGM overnight and Ad-KLF2 or empty vector was added (10 m.o.i.). Cell lysates in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer along with protease inhibitors were collected after 24 and 48 h by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and suspended in 4× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and run on a Tris-glycine SDS gel. Experiments were repeated at least three times. Intracellular Ca2+ Release—HUVECs were cultured in EGM overnight, and Ad-KLF2 or empty vector (Ad-GFP) was added (10 m.o.i.). The cells were serum-starved overnight, loaded with Fura-2 AM and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml VEGF165 (15Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were measured with the DeltaScan illumination system (Photon Technology International) using Felix software. Experiments were repeated at least three times. For VEGFR1 blocking studies, the antibody MF-1 was used at final concentration of 2 μg/ml). In the case of studies using the chimeric EGFR/VEGFR2 receptor (termed EGDR), HUVECs were retrovirally infected 1 day prior to infection with KLF2. Nude Mouse Ear Experiments—6–8-Week-old male nude mice were purchased from the NCI, National Institutes of Health. A non-replicating adenoviral vector was engineered to express the predominant (164 amino acid) murine isoform of VEGF-A as described previously (31Pettersson A. Nagy J.A. Brown L.F. Sundberg C. Morgan E. Jungles S. Carter R. Krieger J.E. Manseau E.J. Harvey V.S. Eckelhoefer I.A. Feng D. Dvorak A.M. Mulligan R.C. Dvorak H.F. Lab.

Immediately prior to use, the adenovirus was desalted using Quick Spin High Capacity G-50 Sephadex columns (Roche Applied Science) and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 3% glycerol. 0.5 × 108 plaque-forming units of Ad-VEGF virus or empty vector (5Senger D.R.

These mice also received two injections of Ad-KLF2 and empty vector 2 days prior and 2 days post-Ad-VEGF injection. Animals were sacrificed on day 7 post-Ad-VEGF administration, and ears were collected and processed for 1-μm Epon sections and paraffin embedding. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ad-VEGF was kindly provided by Dr. Hal Dvorak and Dr. Janice Nagy. Transfection Studies—Transient transfection studies were performed using FuGENE™ 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to instructions by the manufacturer in bovine aortic endothelial cells. A total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used in transfections, and total DNA was always kept constant. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection at which time they were nearly confluent. Then assays were performed for luciferase activity and normalized to β-galactosidase activity in each sample. Gel-shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were harvested form HUVECs infected with control or KLF2 virus and gel-shift studies performed as described previously (27SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Luscinskas F.W. Michel T.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Jain M.K. J. Exp.

The supershift antibody for Sp1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and the anti-KLF2 antibody from J. Leiden (Abbott Laboratories). Adenoviral KLF2 Overexpression Inhibits VEGF-mediated Angiogenesis—To assess the effect of KLF2 on VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis we employed the nude ear mouse model (33Sundberg C. Nagy J.A. Brown L.F. Feng D. Eckelhoefer I.A. Manseau E.J. Dvorak A.M. Dvorak H.F. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1145-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As shown in the protocol in Fig. 1A, we injected control (Ad-GFP) or KLF2 adenovirus (Ad-K2) 2 days before and after injection of Ad-VEGF-A in nude mice. Animals were sacrificed at 1 week after injection of VEGF-A. In the absence of VEGF-A, injection of Ad-GFP and Ad-K2 did not reveal any significant effect on the vasculature. As expected a robust increase in vascularity and edema in the ears of mice treated with Ad-GFP in response to VEGF-A (Fig. 1B, right upper three panels labeled Mouse 1–3). In contrast, we noted a marked attenuation of the angiogenic response (Fig. 1B, right lower three panels labeled Mouse 1–3) and tissue edema in Ad-K2-treated ears. Histopathologic examination verified that adenoviral overexpression successfully infected endothelial cells in vivo (Fig. 1, C, middle panel, and D, right panels). Consistent with the data in Fig. 1B, comparison of Ad-GFP versus Ad-K2 ears revealed a marked reduction in CD34+ staining, a marker of endothelial cells (Fig. 1, C and D, first panel) and ear thickness apparent (compare Fig. 1C, compare upper and lower panels). These observations regarding vessel density and tissue edema were also verified by microscopy of Giemsa-stained 1-μm Epon sections of the ear (Fig. 1C, far right panels). KLF2 Inhibits VEGF-mediated Activation of Endothelial Cells—VEGF-A is known to confer pro-proliferative and proinflammatory effects to endothelial cells (4Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar, 6Kim I. Moon S.O. Kim S.H. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). To gain greater insight into how KLF2 inhibits VEGF-A effects in endothelial cells we first assessed for effect on calcium flux, a sign of cellular activation. As shown in Fig. 2A, adenoviral overexpression of KLF2 in endothelial cells strongly attenuated intracellular calcium release, a sign of VEGFR2/KDR activation. In contrast, KLF2 was unable to inhibit signaling via a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the EGFR receptor fused to the transmembrane/intracellular domain of VEGFR2 (supplemental Fig. 1). We next assessed effects on cellular proliferation by assessing thymidine uptake. As shown in Fig. 2B, in the presence of control adenovirus (Ad-GFP), VEGF induced thymidine incorporation ∼2.3-fold. In contrast, overexpression of KLF2 strongly attenuated VEGF-A-mediated thymidine uptake (Fig. 2B). As discussed above, VEGF-A is also known to induce proinflammatory genes in endothelial cells that, in turn, have been implicated in promoting the angiogenic response. To determine whether KLF2 can alter this effect of VEGF-A, we assessed the effect of KLF2 ovexpression on VEGF-A-mediated induction of VCAM-1, tissue factor, and COX-2. As shown in Fig. 2C, the KLF2 strongly attenuated the VEGF-A-mediated mRNA induction of these factors in endothelial cells (Fig. 2C). KLF2 Inhibits Expression of the VEGFR2 Receptor—To determine the molecular basis of this effect we next assessed for effects on VEGF receptor expression. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, KLF2 overexpression inhibited VEGFR2 mRNA and protein expression. This effect was specific as, in contrast, a mild induction of VEGFR1 expression was observed. However, this induction was not responsible for the inhibitory effect of KLF2 on endothelial activation because a blocking antibody to VEGFR1 did not alter KLF2-mediated inhibition of calcium flux in response to VEGF (supplemental Fig. 2). KLF2 is a transcription factor that can regulate gene expression via both DNA binding-dependent and -independent means (27SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Luscinskas F.W. Michel T.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Jain M.K. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Lin Z. Kumar A.

As a first step toward understanding the molecular basis for KLF2 ability to inhibit VEGFR2 expression, we assessed its affect on the VEGFR2 promoter (34Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, KLF2 strongly inhibited VEGFR2 promoter activity. A combination of 5′ and 3′ promoter deletion studies demonstrated that this inhibitory effect was mediated by a region between –95 and +5 bp. Previous studies have implicated several Sp1 sites contained within this region as critical for basal promoter activity (35Patterson C. Wu Y. Lee M.E. DeVault J.D. Runge M.S. Haber E. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 4B, KLF2 (but not the zinc finger region alone) inhibited the –95 to +5 bp VEGFR2 promoter as well as an Sp1 concatemer (Fig. 4B, right panel). These data suggested that KLF2 might inhibit VEGFR2 promoter activity via effects on Sp1. In principle this may occur through effects on Sp1 expression or function (i.e. binding to DNA). Overexpression of KLF2 did not significantly affect Sp1 protein expression (data not shown). To test the effect of KLF2 on Sp1 directly, gel-shift studies were undertaken using nuclear extracts from HUVECs infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-KLF2. As shown in Fig. 4C, in Ad-GFP-infected cells robust Sp1 binding is observed. The authenticity of this band was verified by competition and antibody experiments resulting in immunodepletion of this complex. In the presence of KLF2, the Sp1 band is markedly attenuated and the emergence of a faster migrating complex is observed. This new complex was immunodepleted by an anti-KLF2 antibody suggesting that KLF2 was contained within this faster migrating complex. These data suggest that KLF2 can bind to the Sp1 site and thereby attenuate VEGFR2 promoter activity. In this study, we identify the transcription factor KLF2 as a potent inhibitor of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Our studies also suggest that this effect is mediated through inhibition of VEGFR2 and, as a consequence, the pro-proliferative and proinflammatory effects of VEGF. Finally, we provide evidence that the molecular basis for inhibition of VEGFR2 expression is through competition for binding between KLF2 and a known transcriptional activator of the VEGFR2 promoter, Sp1. The VEGFR2 is the principal receptor implicated in transducing many of the pro-angiogenic effects of VEGF-A. Although it is expressed at low levels in adulthood (36Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar), VEGFR2 expression may be induced during pathologic states such as chronic inflammation, tumor growth, and wound repair (14Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). For example, pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce VEGFR2 expression. Subsequently, binding to VEGF-A can enhance endothelial cell proliferation, survival, and pro-inflammatory gene expression. We provide evidence that KLF2 can inhibit endothelial cell activation and proliferation (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, with respect to pro-inflammatory gene activation, we find that KLF2 can largely abrogate the VEGF-A-mediated induction of VCAM-1, tissue factor, and COX-2. Previous studies suggest that the proinflammatory effects of VEGF occur, at least in part, through activation of NF-κB (37Giraudo E. Primo L. Audero E. Gerber H.P. Koolwijk P. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Ferrara N. Bussolino F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22128-22135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 38Illi B. Puri P. Morgante L. Capogrossi M.C. Gaetano C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E110-E117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, our previous studies demonstrating that KLF2 can prevent cytokine-mediated activation of the endothelium via inhibition of NF-κB function are particularly relevant (27SenBanerjee S. Lin Z. Atkins G.B. Greif D.M. Rao R.M. Kumar A. Feinberg M.W. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Luscinskas F.W. Michel T.M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Garcia-Cardena G. Jain M.K. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is quite likely that the ability of KLF2 to attenuate the proinflammatory effects of VEGF is due to inhibition of NF-κB activity. Our studies also identify KLF2 as a novel negative regulator of VEGFR2 through competition with Sp1 for binding to the VEGFR2 promoter. The importance of Sp1 in the regulation of VEGFR2 is well established. Elegant studies by Patterson et al. (34Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 35Patterson C. Wu Y. Lee M.E. DeVault J.D. Runge M.S. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8410-8416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were the first to implicate Sp1 as important in the basal expression and cell type-specific expression of the VEGFR2 promoter. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of Sp1 binding to DNA has been shown to prevent the cytokine-mediated induction of VEGFR2 (37Giraudo E. Primo L. Audero E. Gerber H.P. Koolwijk P. Soker S. Klagsbrun M. Ferrara N. Bussolino F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22128-22135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Multiple previous reports support a cooperative and antagonistic relationship between KLFs and Sp1 factors. For example, KLF4 and Sp1 can synergistically activate the laminin γ1 chain promoter (39Higaki Y. Schullery D. Kawata Y. Shnyreva M. Abrass C. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2270-2279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, competition for DNA binding between Sp1 and KLFs has also been reported in the control or the human pre-α inhibitor gene transcription (40Ruminy P. Rouet P. Salier J.P. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 315: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Our deletion studies of the VEGFR2 promoter suggested that KLF2 repressive effects were mediated between –95 and +5 bp, a region densely packed with several Sp1 sites (Fig. 4B). Consistent with this observation, KLF2 inhibited an Sp1 concatemer. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, overexpression of KLF2 in HUVECs reduced Sp1 binding (Fig. 4C). These gel-shift studies were also notable for the emergence of a new faster migrating DNA-protein complex that contained KLF2 (Fig. 4C). Taken together our observations support the possibility that KLF2 displaces Sp1 from the VEGFR2 promoter resulting in a reduction in transcriptional activity. In sum, this study identifies KLF2 as a novel and potent inhibitor of VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis. These observations coupled with a recent report implicating KLF2 as a regulator of tumor cell proliferation (41Wang F. Zhu Y. Huang Y. McAvoy S. Johnson W.B. Cheung T.H. Chung T.K. Lo K.W. Yim S.F. Yu M.M. Ngan H.Y. Wong Y.F. Smith D.I. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3875-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that KLF2 may be an attractive target for therapies aimed at regulating angiogenesis in disease states.

https://openalex.org/W2062094321,"Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is increasingly recognized as an important cellular process involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is considered as one of the major sources of ROS within mitochondria. Yet, the exact site and mechanism of superoxide production by this large membrane-bound multiprotein complex has remained controversial. Here we show that isolated complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica forms superoxide at a rate of 0.15% of the rate measured for catalytic turnover. Superoxide production is not inhibited by ubiquinone analogous inhibitors. Because mutant complex I lacking a detectable iron-sulfur cluster N2 exhibited the same rate of ROS production, this terminal redox center could be excluded as a source of electrons. From the effect of different ubiquinone derivatives and pH on this side reaction of complex I we concluded that oxygen accepts electrons from FMNH or FMN semiquinone either directly or via more hydrophilic ubiquinone derivatives."

Pigmentary glaucoma is one of the most common forms of secondary glaucoma, and its pathogenesis remains unclear.

Pigment dispersion syndrome affects approximate 220,000 Americans, and 25-50% of pigment dispersion syndrome patients eventually go on to manifest as pigmentary glaucoma (www.wills-glaucoma.org/2003symp/moster.htm). Since its initial description over 50 years ago, pigmentary glaucoma has become recognized as one of the most common forms of secondary open-angle glaucoma. It affects a much younger patient population than most other forms of open-angle glaucoma. Hallmarks of this disease include midperipheral iris transillumination defects and a heavily pigmented trabecular mesh-work. The primary causes of these abnormalities are unknown, and the etiology is poorly understood (1Sowka J. Optometry. 2004; 75: 115-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Farrar S.M. Shields M.B. Surv.

Yet, little is known about the molecular and biochemical mechanism(s) underlying this disorder. The DBA/2J mouse has been described as an animal model of human pigmentary glaucoma (3Schuettauf F.

This mouse strain presents several hallmarks of the human pigmentary glaucoma including iris atrophy, pigment dispersion, peripheral anterior synechiae that are associated with development of elevated IOP, retinal ganglion cell loss, and optic nerve head excavation and is not representative of other forms of glaucoma (4John S.W.

Glycoprotein (transmembrane) NMB (GPNMB) is important for melanin biosynthesis and the development of the retinal pigment epithelium and the iris (7Bachner D. Schroder D. Gross G. Brain Res. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2002; 1: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GPNMB is reported to be expressed in some types of dendritic cells (8Ahn J.H. Lee Y. Jeon C. Lee S.J. Lee B.H. Choi K.D. Bae Y.S. Blood. 2002; 100: 1742-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TYRP1 and melanin have been identified as antigens relevant to inflammatory eye disease (9Bora N.S.

It has been demonstrated that the aqueous humor from eyes of affected DBA/2J mice lack the capacity to suppress T cell activation (12Mo J.S. Anderson M.G. Gregory M. Smith R.S. Savinova O.V.

This implies that the pigment disposal in the eyes of DBA/2J mice may involve immune dysfunction and that a mild but chronic inflammatory response occurs in DBA/2J mice. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), previously known as interferon-γ-inducing factor and a recently described member of the IL-1 cytokine superfamily, is now recognized as an important regulator of innate and acquired immune responses (27Sergi B. Penttila I. J. Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents. 2004; 18: 55-61PubMed Google Scholar). Increased levels of IL-18 have been reported in inflammatory/autoimmune diseases (13Gracie J.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2004; 136: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Its functional activities include promotion of cytokine release, particularly TNF-α, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, and Fas-FasL-mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, IL-18 induces NO release, activates NF-κB, possesses prodegradative effects (14Reddy P. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2004; 11: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Martinon F.

IL-18 shares signaling pathways with other IL-1R family members responsible for phosphorylating NF-κB-inducing kinase and IkB-α degradation which allows NF-κB nuclear translocation. In addition, a role for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in IL-18 signaling has recently been suggested (17Gracie J.A. Robertson S.E. McInnes I.B. J.

It has been reported that concurrent administration of IL-12 and IL-18 to mice induced epithelium apoptosis and caused serious atrophy in the lacrimal glands with markedly elevated serum levels of IFN-γ (20Kimura-Shimmyo A. Kashiwamura S. Ueda H. Ikeda T. Kanno S. Akira S. Nakanishi K. Mimura O. Okamura H. J. Immunother. 2002; 25: S42-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the cornea, IL-18 is expressed in epithelial cells. Increased bioactive corneal IL-18 production can be induced by a number of pro-inflammatory agents and may play an important role in initiating IFN-γ-mediated inflammatory responses (21Burbach G.J. Naik S.M. Harten J.B. Liu L. Dithmar S. Grossniklaus H. Ward S.L. Armstrong C.A. Caughman S.W. Ansel J.C. Curr. Eye Res. 2001; 23: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). IL-18 is expressed in the epithelial cells of the iris/ciliary body and in the retina, but its role in these tissues remains undetermined (22Jiang H.R. Wei X. Niedbala W. Lumsden L. Liew F.Y. Forrester J.V. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have made novel observations showing that IL-18 expression in the iris/ciliary body and the level of IL-18 protein level in the aqueous humor of DBA/2J mice is significantly increased. We also observed that activated NF-κB and phosphorylated MAPK are increased in the iris/ciliary body of DBA/2J mice. In addition, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression in the iris/ciliary body and the activity of MMP-2 in the aqueous humor are increased, whereas tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression in the iris/ciliary body is decreased. Furthermore, the expression of apoptosis-related genes and the activity of caspase-3 are increased in the iris/ciliary body of DBA/2J mice. These indicate that the events of inflammation, degradation, and apoptosis are involved in the pathogenesis of pigmentary glaucoma of DBA/2J mice. Animals—The DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice used in this study were from the Jackson Laboratory. All animals were born and raised in a 12-h on versus 12-h off cyclic light environment at an illumination of 50-60 lux. Animals were cared for and handled according to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the use of animals in vision and ophthalmic research and with IACUC approved animal use protocols, which comply with the University of Oklahoma Faculty of Medicine guidelines for use of animals in research. IOP Measurement—IOP was measured using the TonoVet (Colonial Medical Supply, Franconia, NH), an impact (rebound) tonometer. Using this impact tonometer, we were able to measure IOP in awake and nonsedated mice of various ages. Eyes were topically anesthetized with 0.5% tetracaine before IOP measurement. Topical administration of 0.5% tetracaine did not affect IOP. Measurement of IOP was always performed in the morning between 10 and 11 a.m. Six measurements were taken from each eye and averaged. Identification of Retinal Ganglion Cells—Retinal ganglion cells were identified by retrograde labeling with 4-di-10-ASP (catalog number D-291, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Two-month-old mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of a mixture of xylazine and ketamine. The skin over the cranium was incised, and the skull was exposed. Holes ∼1 mm in diameter were drilled in the skull 4 mm posterior to bregma, 1 mm lateral to the midline on both sides of the midline raphe. These positions correspond to the superior colliculi as determined from a stereotactic mouse brain atlas. Three microliters of neurotracer dye 4-di-10-ASP at a concentration of 25 mg/ml were injected into superior colliculi through both holes 2 mm deep. The skull openings were then sealed with a petroleum based antibiotic ointment. The overlying skin was sutured and antibiotic ointment was applied externally. The mice were killed by CO2 inhalation in an approved delivery system. Whole retinal flat mounts were prepared by detaching the retina at the ora serrata and making eight radial relaxing incisions. Imaging of the labeled retinas was performed with a digital camera and a fluorescence microscope at ×20 magnification. Two areas (0.1419 mm2 each) per retinal quadrant at 14 and 34 of the retinal radius were imaged. Cell counting was performed under masked conditions by two independent investigators. We were able to observe labeled retinal ganglion cells in normal mice (C57BL/6J) even 12 months after injection of 4-di-10-ASP. Retinal ganglion cell density was determined by counting the 4-di-10-ASP-labeled retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from eight designated areas in flat-mounted retinas. The total area of the eight fields was 1.1352 mm2, which was more than the area counted by others (63Nakazawa T. Tomita H. Yamaguchi K. Sato Y. Shimura M. Kuwahara S. Tamai M. Curr. Eye Res. 2002; 24: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 64Kermer P. Klocker N. Labes M. Bahr M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative Real-time PCR—After the animals were killed as described previously, the eyes were immediately enucleated, and incisions were made at the ora seratta to remove the anterior segment of the eyes. The iris and ciliary body were separated from the other eye tissue carefully. The Iris/ciliary body tissues were homogenized in the RNA isolation agent TRIzol (Invitrogen) with a Dounce-type homogenizer as described. Total RNA in the extract was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. Purified RNA was digested with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) to remove contamination from genomic DNA. Primers were designed with IDT design software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). All primers were designed with an annealing temperature of 60 °C and a GC content of 55-63%. Specificity of the primers was verified by determining amplicon sizes by gel electrophoresis and by melting curve analysis. In addition, the specificity of the selected primers was verified by a BLAST search of the GenBank™ data base. Real-time PCR was performed in 96-well plates using standard protocols with SYBR® Green as a fluorescent detection dye in a Bio-Rad iCycler. All PCR reactions were at a final volume of 30 μl comprised of SYBR Green PCR mix, 600 μm forward and reverse primers, and 1 ng of cDNA. We used the following PCR cycle parameters: polymerase activation for 15 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. Fluorescence was measured at 72 °C. Melting curve analysis between 50 and 100 °C at 0.5 °C intervals was applied to characterize the generated amplicons and to control for contamination by nonspecific by-products. Standard curves for six 2-fold dilution steps between 4 and 0.125 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA samples were run for all primer pairs in triplicate to determine the PCR efficiency for the different target genes and the housekeeping gene. All PCR reactions for a given sample were performed in five replicates to control for the variability of the PCR amplification. After the exclusion of outliers as determined by irregularities in their amplification curves or their melting curves, the averages of the replicates were used for statistical data processing. At least three no amplification control, a minus-reverse transcriptase control) and three no template control (a minus sample control) were included in each reaction plate. The quantity of mRNA was calculated by normalizing the CT (threshold cycle) of the target gene to the CT of the GAPDH housekeeping gene in the same sample, according to the following formula. The average GAPDH CT (each multiplex PCR was performed in triplicate) was subtracted from the average target gene CT; the result represents the ΔCT. This ΔCT is specific and can be compared with the ΔCT of a calibration sample. The subtraction of control ΔCT from the ΔCT of the target gene is referred as ΔΔCT. The relative quantification of expression of a target gene (in comparison with control) was determined by using 2-ΔΔCT. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—For RT-PCR, 4 μg RNA was mixed in water with random hexamers (50 ng/μl) and 10 mm dNTPs heated to 65 °C for 5 min. The 20-μl RT reaction, which contained RNA, primers, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 40 units of RNase inhibitor (RNase OUT), and 50 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), were assembled. The mixture solution was heated at 42 °C for 1 h and then at 70 °C for 15 min. After chilling on ice, 2 units of RNase H was added to each reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. PCR was carried out in 50-μl reaction volumes, containing 2 μl of cDNA, 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 10 μm each of forward and reverse primers, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. Amplification cycles were: one cycle at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, terminating with 72 °C for 10 min. The products were run on 1% agarose gel containing 10 ng/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Multiprobe RNase Protection Assay—To quantify multiple apoptosis and death receptors/activators mRNAs, a RiboQuant Multiprobe RPA system (PharMingen) with mouse multiprobe template set mAPO-3 was used. The mAPO-3 set contains templates of caspase-8, FASL, FAS, FADD, FAP, FAF, TRAIL, TNFR, TRADD, and RIP. The multiprobe template was biotin-labeled and hybridized overnight with ∼10 μg of RNA. The hybridized RNA was treated with RNase to digest unhybridized RNA and was purified according to the RiboQuant protocol. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide-Tris borate-EDTA-urea gels using a Seqi-Gen GT nuclear acid electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film, and the blot densities were quantified in a NuclearVision 760 Imaging work station (Hayward, CA) using GAPDH bands as concentration standards. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The preparation of retinal nuclear extracts and determination of the NF-κB DNA binding activity were performed using a nuclear and cytoplasmic reagent kit (NE-PER; Pierce). Briefly, retina samples were homogenized in 100 μl of ice-cold cytoplasmic extraction reagent I with a Dounce homogenizer. The sample was vortexed vigorously for 15 s, followed by a 10-min incubation on ice, addition of 5.5 μl of ice-cold cytoplasmic extraction reagent II, and centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytoplastic extract) was immediately transferred to a clean prechilled tube. The nuclear pellet was extracted with 50 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction reagent, vortexed 15 s, and incubated on ice for 40 min. The extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen at -70 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. EMSA was performed using EMSA chemiluminescence kit (LightShift; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocols. A biotin-labeled oligonucleotide containing an NF-κB DNA-binding consensus sequence, 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ (Panomics, Inc.), and a unlabeled oligonucleotide, 5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′, was used to study NF-κB DNA binding activity. Briefly, 3 μg of nuclear extracts from the whole retina was preincubated in a reaction mixture for 20 min, and biotin end-labeled oligonucleotide containing the κB consensus sequence was added. Five microliters of loading buffer was added to each sample. A 20-μl aliquot of the samples was electrophoresed through a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Finally, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (23Cao W. Rajala R.V. Li F. Anderson R.E. Wei N. Soliman C.E.

The iris/ciliary body tissues were sonicated in 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, then centrifuged for 15 min and the supernatant assayed for protein using a Bradford assay. Aliquots (10 μg) of the sonicated supernatant were loaded onto SDS-PAGE mini-gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. After transferring, blots were washed for 2 × 10 min in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 410 mm NaCl) and blocked with 10% BSA in TTBS or with 1% milk and 1% BSA in TTBS for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Blots were incubated with antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Following primary antibody incubations, blots were washed three times for 5 min each with TTBS, then incubated for 1 h with HRP-linked secondary antibodies, washed four times for 10 min each with TTBS, and developed by ECL. In some instances, membranes were stripped by incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C and reused. ELISAs for Enzymatic Activity Assays—Commercially available ELISA kits were used for detection of IL-18 protein level in the aqueous humor (Bender MedSystems, San Bruno, CA) and for the measurement of caspase-3 activity (BioSource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immediately after the mouse was killed by CO2 inhalation, the aqueous humor was obtained using a 30-gauge needle and 10-μl micropipettes (Fisher Scientific) by capillary attraction and pooled into a siliconized microcentrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific). The aqueous humor sample was dilute 1:10 and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min. The cell-free supernatant was frozen immediately at -70 °C. The total protein content in aqueous sample was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) in reference to a bovine albumin standard. Gelatin Zymogram—The activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 of the aqueous humor were measured by gelatin-zymogram protease assays. Samples were prepared with standard SDS-gel-loading buffer containing 0.01% SDS without β-mercaptoethanol and were not boiled before loading. Next, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis with 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (0.75-mm thick, acrylamide/bisacrylamide = 30/1.2) containing 0.1% gelatin. Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 3 h. After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice with 100 ml of distilled water containing 2% Triton X-100 on a gyratory shaker for 30 min at room temperature to remove SDS. The gels were then incubated in 100 ml of reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3) for 12 h at 37 °C, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and destained with methanol-acetic acid-water (50/75/875, v/v/v). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry staining was performed as described previously (25Cao W. Chen W. Elias R. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci.

Briefly, the eye was enucleated then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 h. The whole eye was cut along the vertical meridian. Rabbit anti-IL-18 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Biovision, Inc. Hamster anti-CD69 antibody was purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). The secondary antibody was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (green). Control sections were treated in the same way with omission of primary antibody or with rabbit IgG. Sections were viewed and photo-graphed with fluorescence microscopy. Elevated IOP, Iris Atrophy, and Retinal Ganglion Cell and Neurofiber Loss in the DBA/2J Mouse—As shown in Fig. 1, C and F, dramatic iris atrophy in 9-month-old DBA/2J mice was observed in comparison to that of age-matched C57BL/6J mice. Enlarged blood vessels were seen in the iris (as indicated by the black arrow in Fig. 1C) in ∼50% of DBA/6J mice at 9 months. This alteration is a novel observation and has not been reported in previous publications. The iris edge is indicated by the light green arrow in Fig. 1C and the red arrow in Fig. 1F, showing a pseudo-membrane covering the pupil area. Using the impact tonometer, 578 eyes from 293 C57BL/6J mice and 398 eyes of 201 DBA/2J mice were measured at ages ranging from 1 to 25 months. As shown in Fig. 2A, IOPs of C57BL/6J mice were stable with age, although there was a slight increase after 20 months. There was no significant difference between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice in IOP level at ages 1 and 3 months, whereas a significant increase in IOP was seen in some DBA/2J mice at age 4 months. This increase reached its peak at age 6-9 months and slightly declined at 12 months (Fig. 2B). RGC density was determined by counting the 4-di-10-ASP-labeled RGCs in flat-mounted retinas (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, significant loss of ganglion cells was observed in the flat whole-mount retina of DBA/2J mouse in comparison with its age-matched C57BL/6J mouse (Fig. 3A). Red arrows indicate 4-di-10-ASP-labeled neurofiber. Clear reduction of neurofiber was also observed in the retinas of DBA/2J mice. In addition, a large amount of 4-di-10-ASP-labeled ganglion cell debris was seen in the retina of DBA/2J mice (Fig. 3B). The morphological difference between the ganglion cell layer and neurofiber layer in the retina of C57BL/6J control animals and DBA/2J mice at matched age was compared by histology.

https://openalex.org/W1965577101,"Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common senile dementia, is characterized by amyloid plaques, vascular amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, and progressive neurodegeneration. Amyloid is mainly composed by amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which are derive from processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), better named amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP), by secretases. The AβPP intracellular domain (AID), which is released together with Aβ, has signaling function, since it modulates apoptosis and transcription. Despite its biological and pathological importance, the mechanisms regulating AβPP processing are poorly understood. As cleavage of other γ-secretase substrates is regulated by membrane bound proteins, we have postulated the existence of integral membrane proteins that bind AβPP and regulate its processing. Here, we show that BRI2, a type II membrane protein, interacts with AβPP. Interestingly, 17 amino acids corresponding to the NH2-terminal portion of Aβ are necessary for this interaction. Moreover, BRI2 expression regulates AβPP processing resulting in reduced Aβ and AID levels. Altogether, these findings characterize the BRI2-AβPP interaction as a regulatory mechanism of AβPP processing that inhibits Aβ production. Notably, BRI2 mutations cause familial British (FBD) and Danish dementias (FDD) that are clinically and pathologically similar to AD. Finding that BRI2 pathogenic mutations alter the regulatory function of BRI2 on AβPP processing would define dysregulation of AβPP cleavage as a pathogenic mechanism common to AD, FDD, and FBD.

While the ectodomain is released extracellularly (sAPPβ) or into the lumen of intracellular compartments, the COOH-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids (C99) remains membrane bound. In a second, intramembranous proteolytic event, C99 is cleaved, with somewhat lax site specificity, by the γ-secretase. Two peptides are released in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio: the amyloidogenic Aβ peptide, consisting of 2 major species of 40 and 42 amino acids (Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively), and an intracellular product named AID or AICD, which is very short-lived and has been identified only recently (7Passer B.

In an alternative, nonamyloidogenic proteolytic pathway, AβPP is first processed by α-secretase in the Aβ sequence leading to the production of the sAPPα ectodomain and the membrane-bound COOH-terminal fragment of 83 amino acids (C83). C83 is also cleaved by the γ-secretase into the P3 and AID peptides. While Aβ is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, AID mediates most of the AβPP signaling functions. A pathogenic role for AβPP processing in AD has been ascertained by the finding that mutations in presenilins (10Sherrington R. Rogaev E.I. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Chi H. Lin C.

Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The split-ubiquitin system and human brain libraries were purchased from Dualsystems Biotech (Zurich, Switzerland). The screenings were performed according to the manufacturers protocol. Briefly, human AβPP (amino acids 1–695), human AβPP (amino acids 1–664; AβPPNcas), or human APLP2 were cloned into pTMV4, pAMBV4, and pAMBV4 bait vectors, respectively, to obtain APP family bait proteins fused to the COOH-terminal half of ubiquitin (Cub), followed by a reporter fragment (LexA, a DNA-binding protein, fused to VP16, a transcriptional activation). Human brain libraries express proteins fused at the NH2-terminal half of mutated ubiquitin (NubG). For each library we screened ∼5 × 106 transformants. Clones coding for proteins that can interact with AβPP/APLP2-Cub will promote the NubG-Cub interaction followed by recruitment of ubiquitin-specific protease(s), cleavage of the AβPP/APLP2-Cub bait, release of the LexA-VP16 transcription factor, and the transcriptional activation of the two reporter genes (lacZ and HIS3). Library plasmids were recovered from HIS3- and lacZ-positive yeast transformants, identified by nucleotide sequencing, and cloned into pcDNA3.1 with an NH2-terminal FLAG tag and directly tested its ability to interact with AβPP by immunoprecipitation as described below. Screening for co-activator of both reporter genes resulted in the identification of known AβPP/APLP2-binding proteins, such as Fe65 (20Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P.

Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Of note, neuro-pathological findings in FBD and FDD include amyloid and/or preamyloid parenchyma plaques, congophilic amyloid angiopathy, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration, similar to AD. Hence, because mutations in BRI2 cause AD-like familial dementia we have further studied the physiological relevance of this BRI2-AβPP interaction.To assess the BRI2-AβPP interaction in mammalian cells, HeLa cells were co-transfected with BRI2 and AβPP constructs (Fig. 1a). Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an αFLAG antibody showed that BRI2 interacted with full-length AβPP (Fig. 1, b and d), C99 (Fig. 1, b and d), and AβPPNcas, which present a deletion of most of the intracellular region of AβPP (Fig. 1c) but not C83 (Fig. 1, b and d). AβPP runs as a doublet. The lower AβPP band represents nonglycosylated, immature AβPP; the upper form is instead composed of mature, glycosylated AβPP. Of note, only the mature, glycosylated forms of AβPP and AβPPNcas interacted with BRI2 (Fig. 1, b–d). It should also be noted that BRI2 overexpression dramatically increases the levels of C99 (Fig. 1, b and d). The significance of this finding will be discussed below.Deletion of most of the BRI2 ecto-domain did not abolish the binding to APP (BRI21–131, Fig. 1d). The reverse immunoprecipitation with an αAβPP antibody revealed that AβPP immunoprecipitates BRI2 (Fig. 1e). Additionally, a proteolytic ∼17-kDa BRI2 NH2-terminal fragment detected in transfected HeLa cells (BRI2nt, which is similar in size to BRI21–131) was also precipitated with AβPP (Fig. 1e). The specificity of these interactions was supported by the evidence that BRI2 did not bind to ApoER2, another type I integral membrane protein (Fig. 1c). These findings attest that while the intracytoplasmic tail of AβPP and most of the AβPP and BRI2 ectodomain are not important for BRI2/AβPP interaction, a 17-amino acid region in the ectodomain of AβPP, juxtaposed to the transmembrane region and containing the NH2-terminal Aβ sequence, is essential for this binding. These data strongly suggest that BRI2 and AβPP do not interact in trans (i.e. as receptor/ligand expressed on distinct membranes) but, rather, form a molecular complex in cellular membranes.AβPP and BRI2 are both expressed in mature neural tissues. We therefore sought to determine whether AβPP also interacts with BRI2 in the adult human brain. First, we tested four anti-BRI2 antibodies to determine whether they could immunoprecipitate human BRI2. For these tests, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-BRI2 and immunoprecipitated with the four BRI2 antibodies and controls. As shown in Fig. 2a, only the EN3 anti-BRI2 antibody was able to precipitate BRI2. Next, we made homogenates of human brains and performed immunoprecipitation with either the αAβPPct antibody or EN3. As shown in Fig. 2b, C99 (and larger COOH-terminal AβPP fragments) was precipitated with both anti-AβPP as well as EN3 antibodies, while C99 was not precipitated with a rabbit polyclonal IgG. Of interest, also in this case C83 did not precipitate with BRI2, although it was precipitated by αAβPPct. Moreover, full-length AβPP was also precipitated by EN3, albeit at low levels. Altogether, these experiments indicate that endogenous AβPP and BRI2 associate in the adult human brain. In addition, they show that BRI2 preferentially interacts with C99 and larger AβPP COOH-terminal fragments but not with C83.Fig. 2Endogenous AβPP and BRI2 interact in the adult brain. a, lysates from HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-BRI2 were precipitated with a chicken control antibody (lane 3), a commercially available chicken αBRI2 antibody (lane 6), protein A/G beads alone (lane 9), a control rabbit polyclonal antibody (lane 12), the rabbit polyclonal EN3 αBRI2 antibody (lane 15), a distinct rabbit αBRI2 serum (lane 18), and a mouse αBRI2 polyclonal (lane 21). Total lysates (L), supernatants (S), and precipitants (P) were gel-separated and probed with αFLAG. Only EN3 was capable of precipitating BRI2. BRI2nt fragments of ∼17 and 14 kDa were not precipitated, since the epitope recognized by EN3 is COOH-terminal to the Brichos domain. b, total brain homogenates were immunoprecipitated with either a control rabbit polyclonal (RP), αAβPPct, or EN3. Total brain lysate (T.L.) and immunoprecipitants were blotted with the αAβPP monoclonal antibody 22C11 (top panel) or αAβPPct (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As shown in Fig. 1, b and d, expression of BRI2 constructs invariantly results in increased levels of C99. It is likely that this dramatic increase in C99 levels is dependent on an effect of BRI2 on APP processing. To directly test for this, we expressed FLAG-tagged BRI2 in HeLa, HEK293, and N2a cells together with AβPP-Gal4, a luciferase reporter under the control of a Gal4 promoter and β-galactosidase. AβPP-Gal4 is a fusion of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 to the cytoplasmic domain of AβPP. γ-Cleavage of AβPP-Gal4 will release AID-Gal4 from the membrane to the nucleus with consequent activation of luciferase transcription (26Gianni D. Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Minopoli G. Mercken L. Talamo F. Scaloni A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9290-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3a, BRI2 reduces luciferase activity in all three cell lines, suggesting an inhibition of AID formation. Instead, transfection of mouse β-secretase (BACE) resulted in increased AID release, as expected (Fig. 3b). The BRI21–131 mutant, which still interacts with AβPP and produces increased C99 levels (Fig. 1d), also inhibits AID release (Fig. 3c). Last, mixing experiments show that, for BRI2 to repress AID-Gal4 release, it must be co-expressed with AβPP-Gal4 in the same cell. In fact, mixing cells expressing BRI2 with cells expressing AβPP-Gal4 does not affect release of AID (Fig. 3d). This further suggests that BRI2 and AβPP interact in cis rather than in trans.Fig. 3BRI2 regulates AβPP processing by secretases. a–c, BRI2 reduces the AβPP-Gal4-driven luciferase activity in HeLa, N2a, and HEK293 cells. Cells were co-transfected with AβPP-Gal4 together with pcDNA3.1 (pc) or FLAG-BRI2, BRI21–131, or BACE. Data are expressed as percentage of the luciferase activity measured in cells transfected with the empty vector. BRI2, BACE, and pcDNA3.1-transfected cells express similar levels of AβPP-Gal4 (data not shown). Error bars represent S.D. for three independent experiments. d, cells were transfected with either AβPP-Gal4, pcDNA3.1 (pc), or BRI2. Cells transfected with AβPP-Gal4 were than mixed at the indicated ratio with either BRI2 or pcDNA3.1 transfected cells. Samples were analyzed for luciferase activity as described above 24 h after transfection and mixing. e and f, BRI2 inhibits production of Aβ40/Aβ42. HEK293 cells stably expressing AβPP (HEK293AβPP) were transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA3.1 (pc)), BACE, or FLAG-BRI2, and Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted in the media were measured by ELISA. The Aβ amount was normalized by the protein content of the lysates of the transfected cells. Error bars represent S.D. for three independent experiments. g, pulse-chase experiment, representative of four independent experiments, of transfected HeLa cells. HEK293AβPP cells were transfected with an empty vector (Vector) or FLAG-BRI2. The lysates of metabolically labeled cells were precipitated with αAβPPct. The numbers above each lane indicates the hours the cells were chased (c). BRI2 expression decreases C83 production while dramatically increasing the generation of C99. h, the conditioned media of similarly transfected HEK293AβPP cells were harvested after 4 h labeling and were precipitated with either p21 or 6E10. While the amounts of sAPPα were decreased by BRI2, the total sAPP (sAPPα+sAPPβ) did not show a significant change indicating an augmentation of sAPPβ production and a shift of AβPP processing from α-to β-secretase. Vec., vector. i, cells were transfected with APLP2 together with either pcDNA3.1 or BRI2. 24 h after transfection, cells were analyzed by Western blot for BRI2 and APLP2 peptides. Vec., vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further validate this system, we have measured Aβ in the conditioned media of HEK 293 transfected with BRI2 and found that BRI2 significantly diminished Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels (Fig. 3b). Again, BACE transfection increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion (Fig. 3f).Inhibition of AID and Aβ production by BRI2 suggests that BRI2 expression reduces cleavage of AβPP by the γ-secretase. However, it is also possible that BRI2 could modulate the β- and α-cleavage of AβPP. As discussed above, cleavage of AβPP by either β- or α-secretase releases sAPPβ and sAPPα in the supernatant, respectively. While increased amounts of either sAPPα or sAPPβ indicate increased α-or β-cleavage, reduction of either sAPPα or sAPPβ reflect decreased α- or β-cleavage. Thus, to determine whether BRI2 affects either β- or α-secretase, we measured the amounts of sAPPα and sAPPβ. In these same experiments, we also measured intracellular levels of C99 and C83. HEK293-APP cells were transfected with FLAG-BRI2 or a vector control. Transfected cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine-cysteine for 30 min, then chased for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h at 37 °C (Fig. 3c). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αAβPP-ct antibody at each time point (Fig. 3c). To measure secreted AβPP (sAPPα and sAPPβ), supernatants were collected from cells labeled for 4 h and precipitated with the anti-AβPP antibodies P21 (which precipitates both sAPPα and sAPPβ) or 6E10 (which only precipitates sAPPα) (Fig. 3d). BRI2 transfection resulted in decreased amounts of C83 (Fig. 3c) and sAPPα (Fig. 3d). Conversely, the levels of C99 (Fig. 3c) and sAPPβ (Fig. 3d) were augmented. Notably, BRI2 was co-immunoprecipitated by the αAβPP-ct antibody at all time points. Thus, BRI2 expression reduces cleavage of AβPP by α-secretase while increasing its processing by β-secretase. The concomitant inhibition of γ-secretase and increase in β-cleavage of AβPP explains the dramatic increase in C99 levels.AβPP is a member of a family of proteins that includes APLP1 and APLP2. APLP1 and APLP2 are also γ-secretase substrates (22Sheinfeld M.H. Ghersi E. Laky K. Fowlkes B.J. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44195-44201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and among the numerous γ-secretase substrates are those that bear more sequence similarity to AβPP. Thus, to test whether BRI2 generally affects γ-secretase or specifically inhibits γ-cleavage of AβPP, we transfected BRI2 with either APLP1 and APLP2. Western blot using anti-APLP1 or anti-APLP2 COOH-terminal antibodies indicates that BRI2 expression does not promote accumulation of COOH-terminal fragments of APLP1 (data not shown) and APLP2 (Fig. 3i). This result supports the notion that BRI2 specifically blocks the γ-activity on AβPP but not on other γ-substrates.Altogether, our studies suggest that BRI2 and AβPP form a multimolecular complex in cell membranes. While the stoichiometry of AβPP and BRI2 in such complexes has to be investigated and whether BRI2 and AβPP are found in a structure comprising other proteins is unknown, our data suggest that BRI2 functions as an endogenous regulator of AβPP processing. More specifically, we found that BRI2 expression decreases both α- and γ-cleavage of AβPP while increasing its β-processing. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms responsible for these functions must be directly addressed, the finding that BRI2 interacts with a region of AβPP comprising the α- and γ-cleavage sites insinuates that BRI2 physically masks the two target sequences from the secretases. Increased β-activity might be consequential to the reduced α-processing.Recently, mutations in BRI2 have been found in FBD (16Vidal R. Frang"

However, SMCs retain the ability to de-differentiate into a proliferative phenotype, which is involved in the progression of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. Understanding the mechanisms involved in maintaining SMC differentiation is critical for preventing proliferation associated with vascular disease. In this study, the molecular mechanisms through which transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) induces differentiation of SMCs were examined. TGF-β1 stimulated actin re-organization, inhibited cell proliferation, and up-regulated SMC marker gene expression in PAC-1 SMCs. These effects were blocked by pretreatment of cells with either HA1077 or Y-27632, which inhibit the kinases downstream of RhoA. Moreover, TGF-β1 activated RhoA and its downstream target PKN. Overexpression of active PKN alone was sufficient to increase the transcriptional activity of the promoters that control expression of smooth muscle (SM) α-actin, SM-myosin heavy chain, and SM22α. In addition, PKN increased the activities of serum-response factor (SRF), GATA, and MEF2-dependent enhancer-reporters. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of PKN abolished TGF-β1-induced activation of SMC marker gene promoters. Finally, examination of MAPK signaling demonstrated that TGF-β1 increased the activity of p38 MAPK, which was required for activation of the SMC marker gene promoters. Co-expression of dominant negative p38 MAPK was sufficient to block PKN-mediated activation of the SMC marker gene promoters as well as the serum-response factor, GATA, and MEF2 enhancers.

Expression of these SMC marker genes results in the increased myofibrillar organization required for contraction. Differentiated SMCs retain the ability to “de-differentiate” into a synthetic, proliferative phenotype, characterized by the loss of SMC marker gene expression. This phenotype reappears with certain vascular disease states, including atherosclerosis and restenosis (1Halayko A.J. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 5Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). Consequently, understanding the mechanisms that promote and maintain the differentiated phenotype will provide insight into the aberrant growth seen in pathologic SMC proliferation. Considerable strides have been made toward understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate SMC differentiation. In particular, a role for TGF-β1 in SMC differentiation has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, although the signal transduction pathways required for these effects are not completely clear (6Grainger D.J.

The classic signaling cascade downstream of TGF-β1 involves activation of the Smads family of transcription factors (11Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β1 signaling has been linked recently to the activation of the small GTPase RhoA in other cell types (12Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A. Engel M.E. Arteaga C.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15362-15368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). RhoA signaling is known to induce many of the same phenotype changes in SMCs as TGF-β1 (including myofibrillar re-organization and up-regulation of SMC marker gene expression) and thus may be a novel target involved in producing the downstream effects of TGF-β1 in SMCs (1Halayko A.J. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Parmacek M.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 51: 69-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mack C.P. Somlyo A.V. Hautmann M. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways through which RhoA elicits its downstream effects in SMCs have yet to be elucidated completely. Two key downstream targets of RhoA are Rho kinase and PKN. Although Rho kinase has been established to participate in the up-regulation of SMC marker gene expression, use of a dominant negative form of Rho kinase cannot completely block the effects of active RhoA (17Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Moreover, constitutively active Rho kinase does not completely recapitulate the phenotype seen with active RhoA (18Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This implies that there are additional signaling molecules (PKN or others) through which RhoA mediates its downstream effects. The goal of the present study was to identify the signaling pathway through which TGF-β1 regulates changes in SMC phenotype, with an emphasis on the control of transcriptional regulation of several SMC marker genes. For these studies, we examined the rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell line, PAC-1, based upon their ability to de-differentiate in response to serum exposure and to differentiate into smooth muscle myocytes upon serum withdrawal (19Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith C.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that treatment with TGF-β1 induces PAC-1 cells to adopt a more differentiated phenotype, as shown by actin filament organization, reduced proliferation, and up-regulation of SMC marker gene expression. Furthermore, these effects of TGF-β1 require the activity of the kinases downstream of RhoA. Specifically, our results demonstrate the importance of PKN, one of the downstream targets of RhoA, in mediating the effects of TGF-β1 on SMC marker gene expression. In addition, we show that PKN stimulates SRF, GATA, and MEF2-dependent transcription. These transcription factors have been demonstrated to be required for SMC differentiation and thus may be important for PKN-mediated activation of the SMC marker gene promoters (1Halayko A.J. Solway J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Mano T. Luo Z. Malendowicz S.L. Evans T. Walsh K. Circ.

Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we report that the effects of TGF-β1 and PKN on SMC marker gene expression require the activity of p38 MAP kinase. Together, these results delineate a novel signaling pathway whereby TGF-β1 activates PKN and p38 MAP kinase to induce phenotypic changes in PAC-1 SMCs indicative of differentiation.

Immunocytochemistry—PAC-1 cells were cultured on 1.5% gelatin-coated coverslips in 12-well tissue culture plates at a starting density of 1 × 104 cells/well. 24 h post-plating, cells were pretreated with HA1077, Y-27632, or vehicle control (water) for 3 h prior to the addition of TGF-β1 or vehicle control (4 mm HCl + 0.1% BSA) for 48 h. As a positive control, cells were stimulated to differentiation by serum withdrawal (media 199 supplemented with 0.5% FBS) for 48 h. Following treatment, cells were fixed in 1:1 acetone:methanol solution. The coverslips were blocked with 5% BSA in HBSS and then incubated in primary antibody (monoclonal anti-α smooth muscle actin, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C in HBSS + 1% BSA followed by the addition of secondary antibody (AlexaFluor® 594 goat anti-mouse IgG, Molecular Probes), in 1% BSA in HBSS at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence was visualized using an Olympus AX70 fluorescent microscope. The fields shown are representative data collected from three independent experiments. Reverse Transcription and Semi-quantitative PCR—PAC-1 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes at a starting density of 2.8 × 105 cells per dish. 24 h post-plating, cells were treated as described for immunocytochemistry. Following treatment, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using Super-Script™III RT (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Semi-quantitative PCR was then performed using gene-specific primers for SMC marker genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Integrated DNA Technologies), or a commercially available 18 S rRNA primer set (Ambion). Sequences of gene-specific primers were as follows: for SM α-actin, sense 5′-ACTGGGACGACATGGAAAAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CATACATGGCAGGGACATTG-3′; for SM-MHC (primers recognize both SM1 and SM2 gene products), sense 5′-GAAAGCCAAGAGTCTGGAGG-3′ and antisense 5′-CACTCATGGCCTCCATGTTG-3′; and for SM22α sense, 5′-TGAGCAAGTTGGTGAACAGC3-′ and anti-sense 5′-ACTGCCCAAAGCCATTACAG-3′. Cell Proliferation Assay—PAC-1 cells were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates at a starting density of 4 × 104 cells per well. 6 h post-plating, cells were pretreated with HA1077, Y-27632, or vehicle control for 3 h. Following pretreatment, TGF-β1 or vehicle control was added. Total cell number was then determined following 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of TGF-β1 stimulation using a Coulter cell counter (Beckman Coulter). As a control, cells were stimulated to differentiate by serum withdrawal (media 199 supplemented with 0.5% FBS). Each group was tested in triplicate for each time point per experiment. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—PAC-1 cells were cultured in 12-well tissue culture plates at a starting density of 2.4 × 104 cells/well. For TGF-β1 experiments, PAC-1 cells were transfected 40 h post-plating by using Lipofectamine™ supplemented with Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were pretreated with HA1077 and Y-27632 and treated with TGF-β1 as described for immunocytochemistry. For all other transfections, PAC-1 cells were transfected 48 h post-plating by using Lipofectamine™ per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and luciferase activity was measured 24 h post-transfection. Plasmid concentrations (per well) were as follows: 30 ng of promoter-reporter, 100 ng of enhancer-reporter, 1 or 10 ng of PKN-AF3 and PKN-AF3(K644E) (1 ng for 6xGATA-luc and 4xSRF-luc and 10 ng for all other reporters), and 100 ng of p38αAF. Total plasmid concentration per well was normalized with empty vector DNA. Luciferase activity was determined by luminometry (Turner Designs Luminometer model 20) using a commercially available substrate kit (Promega). Each data set was independently replicated a minimum of three times with each experimental group tested in triplicate. Luciferase activity is expressed as the mean ± S.E. Initial experiments included co-transfection of an SV40-driven β-galactosidase construct as a control for transfection efficiency; however, minimal variability (<10%) among each independent experiment was seen. Moreover, Shimizu et al. (33Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) reported that the inclusion of viral driven control vectors alter SMC marker gene promoter activity by potentially sequestering common transcription factors. For these reasons, this vector was excluded from further experiments. Western Blot for SMC Marker Proteins—PAC-1 cells were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at a starting density of 2.8 × 105 cells per dish. 40 h post-plating, cells were treated with vehicle control or TGF-β1 for 48 h. Following treatment, cells were lysed, and the relative abundance of SM α-actin, SM-MHC, and SM22α was determined with commercially available antibodies (Sigma, Biomedical Technologies, Inc., and Abcam, respectively). RhoA Activity Assay—PAC-1 cells were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at a starting density of 2.8 × 105 cells per dish. 48 h post-plating, cells were treated with vehicle control or TGF-β1 for 2-60 min. Following treatment, RhoA activity was determined using the EZ-Detect™ Rho activity kit (Pierce) per the manufacturer's instructions. Assessment of Protein Phosphorylation—PAC-1 cells were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at a starting density of 2.8 × 105 cells per dish. 48 h post-plating, cells were treated with vehicle control or TGF-β1 for 2-60 min. Cells were lysed, and the phosphorylation status of PKN, ERK1/2, JNK1/2, or p38 MAP kinase was measured by Western blot analysis using the following antibodies: anti-phospho-PKN(Thr-778)/PRK2(Thr-816) (p-PKN/p-PRK2), anti-phospho-p44/p42(Thr-202/Tyr-204) (p-ERK1/2), anti-phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) (p-JNK1/2), or anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182) (p-p38 MAPK) (Cell Signaling Technology). In addition, the total amount of each protein was detected using antibodies specific for PKN (anti-PKN) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK1/2 (anti-p44/p42), JNK1/2 (anti-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK), or p38 MAP kinase (anti-p38 MAPK) (Cell Signaling Technology) to detect any changes in their expression with treatment. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. p38 MAP Kinase Activity Assay—PAC-1 cells were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes seeded at a starting density of 2.8 × 105 cells per dish. 48 h post-plating, cells were treated with vehicle control or TGF-β1 for 2-60 min prior to lysis. The kinase activity of p38 MAPK was examined using a nonradioactive p38 MAPK assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) per the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, SB203580 (Calbiochem) was used to test the specificity of the kinase activity. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. RNAi—The pSUPER-PKN RNAi vector was constructed by ligation of the following oligonucleotide pair to the pSUPER.neo+gfp vector, which was obtained from Oligoengine, according to manufacturer's instructions: 5′-gatccccGATTGACATCATCCGCATGttcaagagaCATGCGGATGATGTCAATCttttta-3′ (sense) and 5′-agcttaaaaaGATTGACATCATCCGCATGtctcttgaaCATGCGGATGATGTCAATCggg-3′ (anti-sense). The scramble siRNA negative control was constructed by ligation of the following oligonucleotide pair to the pSUPER.neo+gfp vector: 5′-gatccccACGCACACGTGCATATGTTttcaagagaAACATATGCACGTGTCGCtttttta-3′ (sense) and 5′-agcttaaaaaACGCACACGTGCATATGTTtctcttgaaAACATATGCACGTGTGCGTggg-3′ (antisense). For analysis of PKN knock-down, PAC-1 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates at a starting density of 5.0 × 104 cells per well. Cells were transfected with 250, 500, or 1000 ng of either PKN siRNA or scramble siRNA using Lipofectamine™ supplemented with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h following transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to Western blotting to detect PKN (mouse anti-PKN; Pharmingen). For TGF-β1 experiments, PAC-1 cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates at a starting density of 2.4 × 104 cells/ml. 40 h post-plating, cells were transfected with 30 ng of SM α-actin-luc, SM-MHC-luc, or SM22α-luc along with 250 ng of either PKN siRNA or scramble siRNA using Lipofectamine™ supplemented with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Total DNA per well was normalized with empty vector. 48 h post-transfection, cells were treated with either vehicle control or TGF-β1 for another 48 h prior to luciferase assay. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software (version 4.0, GraphPad Software Inc.) using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's post-hoc test for inter-group comparisons. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. TGF-β1 Stimulates Actin Re-organization in PAC-1 Cells—A role for TGF-β1 in the differentiation of SMCs has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo (6Grainger D.J. Metcalfe J.C. Grace A.A. Mosedale D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2977-2988PubMed Google Scholar, 7Adam P.J. Regan C.P. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol.

Although the effects of TGF-β1 have been tested on several SMC lines and models, the response of PAC-1 cells to TGF-β1 stimulation has not been characterized previously. To test whether TGF-β1 induces phenotypic changes in PAC-1 cells toward a more differentiated phenotype, we first examined morphological changes in the actin organization of proliferating cells cultured in the absence or presence of TGF-β1. In addition, the actin organization of PAC-1 cells stimulated to differentiate by serum withdrawal was examined as a control. PAC-1 cells treated with TGF-β 1 for 48 h displayed increased actin organization compared with untreated proliferating cells (Fig. 1A, compare middle panel to left panel). Moreover, PAC-1 cells that had been cultured in low serum for 48 h displayed increased actin organization, similar to TGF-β1-treated cells (Fig. 1A, compare right panel to middle panel). These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 stimulates actin re-organization of PAC-1. TGF-β1 Slows Proliferation of PAC-1 Cells—Differentiation of SMC is associated with cell cycle arrest and a subsequent reduction in proliferation (34Boehm M. Nabel E.G. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to examine whether TGF-β1 affects the proliferative capacity of PAC-1 cells. To do this, PAC-1 cells were plated at an equal starting density and allowed to proliferate for 12, 24, 36, or 48 h in the absence or presence of TGF-β1. Following treatment, the total cell number per group was counted. Cells cultured in the presence of TGF-β1 displayed reduced proliferation compared with untreated cells, which proliferated in a relatively linear fashion (Fig. 1B). Cells that were stimulated to differentiate by serum withdrawal showed very little proliferation (Fig. 1B). These data show that TGF-β1 attenuates serum-induced proliferation of PAC-1 cells. TGF-β1 Increases Expression of SMC Marker Genes in PAC-1 Cells—To demonstrate further that TGF-β1 promotes a more differentiated phenotype in PAC-1 cells, we examined changes in the expression of mRNA encoding SMC marker genes in actively proliferating cells cultured in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 or in PAC-1 cells stimulated to differentiate by serum withdrawal. Untreated proliferating PAC-1 cells showed only low level expression of the three definitive SMC marker genes, SM α-actin, SM-MHC, and SM22α, as measured by RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cells treated with TGF-β1 for 48 h displayed increased expression of all three SMC marker genes, in a manner similar to cells stimulated to differentiate by serum withdrawal (Fig. 1C). In addition to measuring the relative expression of the SMC marker genes by RT-PCR, we tested whether TGF-β1 alters the activity of the promoters that control the expression of these genes. Indeed, the activity of all three SMC marker gene promoters was increased in PAC-1 cells treated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 1D), arguing that TGF-β1 increases the expression of these genes at the level of transcription. Finally, protein levels of SM α-actin, SM-MHC, and SM22α were increased in TGF-β1 treated PAC-1 cells compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1E). When combined, the results from Fig. 1 strongly argue that TGF-β1 stimulates PAC-1 cells to adopt a more differentiated phenotype. TGF-β1 Effects Require RhoA Signaling—To determine whether RhoA signaling is required for the effects of TGF-β1 on PAC-1 cells, we utilized two chemical inhibitors, HA1077 and Y-27632. These inhibitors have been reported recently to block specifically the function of the RhoA-associated kinases Rho kinase and PKN/PRK2 (35Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). PAC-1 cells were pretreated with HA1077 or Y-27632 prior to the addition of TGF-β1, and the relative actin re-organization, proliferation rate, and expression of SMC marker genes of these cells were compared with proliferating PAC-1 cells or to cells stimulated to differentiate by the addition of TGF-β1 alone. Pretreatment of cells with either HA1077 or Y-27632 attenuated TGF-β1-induced actin re-organization (Fig. 2A). In addition, pretreatment with either inhibitor prevented TGF-β1-induced reduction of cell proliferation, restoring total cell number at each time point to near control values (Fig. 2B). Finally, pretreatment with HA1077 or Y-27632 blocked TGF-β1-mediated up-regulation of SM α-actin, SM-MHC, and SM22α as assessed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2C) and promoter-reporter assay (Fig. 2D). Taken together, results from Fig. 2 demonstrate that RhoA and its downstream kinases play an important role in mediating the downstream effects of TGF-β1 on PAC-1 cells.

Gap junctional communication and channel assembly can be regulated by protein-protein interaction with kinases and phosphatases. We have utilized tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequence analysis as a screen to identify proteins from cell lysates that interact with the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of connexin 43 (Cx43). MS/MS analysis of tryptic fragments yielded several proteins including zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), a structural protein previously identified to interact with Cx43, and ZO-2, a potential novel interacting partner. We confirmed the interaction of ZO-2 with Cx43 by using a combination of fusion protein “pull down,” co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization experiments. We show that the C-terminal region of Cx43 is necessary for interaction with the PDZ2 domain of ZO-2. Far Western analysis revealed that ZO-2 can directly bind to Cx43 independent of other interacting partners. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that both ZO-1 and ZO-2 can co-localize with Cx43 within the plasma membrane at apparent gap junctional structures. We examined Cx43 interaction with ZO-1 and ZO-2 at different stages of the cell cycle and found that Cx43 had a strong preference for interaction with ZO-1 during G0, whereas ZO-2 interaction occurred approximately equally during G0 and S phases. Since essentially all of the Cx43 in G0 cells is assembled into Triton X-100-resistant junctions, Cx43-ZO-1 interaction may contribute to their stability.

Gap junctions are tightly packed clusters of intercellular channels that directly connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells. These pathways provide for the cell-to-cell diffusion of small molecules, including ions, amino acids, nucleotides, and secondary messengers (e.g. Ca2+, cAMP, cGMP, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) and for the conductance of electrical impulses in excitable cells. There are at least 20 gap junction protein or “connexin” family members in humans, many of which have been cloned and characterized in mice (1White T. Paul D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 283-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 2Sohl G. Willecke K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Connexin expression is tissue specific, and connexin 43 (Cx43) 1The abbreviations used are: Cx43, connexin 43; NRK, normal rat kidney; CT, carboxyl-terminal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ZO-1, zona occludens-1; ZO-2, zona occludens-2; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; PDZ, PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1; HA, hemagglutinin. is the predominant connexin in epithelial and most other tissues. Recent studies utilizing transgenic mice with altered connexin genes and linkage of connexin gene alterations to human disease provide strong support for roles in cell growth control and embryonic development. For example, the homozygous deletion of Cx37, Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45 causes neonatal or embryonic lethality in mice (1White T. Paul D. Annu. Rev.

Perhaps the most well known is the interaction of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) with the carboxyl terminus of Cx43 (4Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr.

Originally identified as a component of tight junctions, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 are members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of proteins that each contain at least one PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, an Src homology 3 domain, and an enzymatically inactive guanylate kinase domain (6Gumbiner B.

PDZ domain-containing proteins like ZO-1 typically act as scaffolding proteins that organize membrane receptors and cytosolic proteins into multimeric signaling complexes often at the sites of cell-cell contact (11Craven S.E.

Although several potential functions have been proposed for these protein-Cx43 interactions, the roles that they play in the regulation of Cx43 trafficking, assembly, gating, and turnover are not well understood. We believed that a thorough analysis and classification of Cx43-interacting proteins might elucidate these roles, so we employed a proteomic approach to identify proteins that interact with Cx43 directly or via a protein complex. Our mass spectrometry-based approach yielded many potential binding partners (26Singh D. Lampe P.D. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2003; 10: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and here we report that Cx43 directly binds to ZO-2. We have characterized the interaction of ZO-2 with Cx43 by using a combination of “pull down,” co-immunoprecipitation, far Western, and immunofluorescence experiments. We present evidence that the C-terminal tail of Cx43 interacts directly with ZO-2 in vitro, in cultured cells and in cardiac tissue. Comparison of the binding of ZO-1 and ZO-2 shows that ZO-1 binds preferentially to Cx43 during the G0 stage of the cell cycle. Our data suggest that ZO-1 and ZO-2 are key scaffolding proteins that can differentially bind to Cx43 at the membrane junctional complex during the cell cycle. Plasmids—N-terminal, HA-tagged wild type ZO-2 (HA-ZO-2) was cloned in the cytomegalovirus expression vector GW1 as previously described to generate GW1HA-ZO-2 (27Glaunsinger B.A. Weiss R.S. Lee S.S. Javier R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5578-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ZO-2 sequences encoding the PDZ1 (amino acids 4-113), PDZ2 (amino acids 290-371), and PDZ3 (amino acids 492-585) domains were cloned in the PGEX-2T vector to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PDZ1, GST-PDZ2, and GST-PDZ3, respectively. The Cx43 sequence encoding for the carboxyl terminus (CT) amino acids 236-382 of Cx43 was cloned into pGEX-2T or pGEX-2TK vector to generate GST-Cx43CT. CT deletion constructs Δ290 (missing amino acids 280-300), Δ330 (missing amino acids 321-340), Δ369 missing (amino acids 364-373), T-374 (missing amino acids 375-382), and T-379 (missing amino acids 380-382) were all cloned into the pGEX-2T vector to generate the respective GST deletion constructs. GST constructs were transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli, and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (28Cooper C.D. Lampe P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44962-44968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were quantified in gels by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cell Culture and Cell Extracts—Normal rat kidney (NRK) epithelial cells (NRK-E51; American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA) in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were grown to confluence, washed in PBS, and harvested on ice in 400 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 500 μm Na3VO4, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, 1× Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min. Cell supernatant from NRK cells was precleared with GST bound to glutathione beads or protein A and used in pull down or immunoprecipitation experiments, respectively. Our protocol for the cell cycle synchronization of NRK cells has been previously described (29Solan J.L. Fry M.D. TenBroek E.M. Lampe P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 293-T cells were grown to 80% confluence and transiently transfected with 1 μg of GW1HA-Z0-2 using Fugene reagent (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer after 48 h. Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS Analysis—Our protocol for analyzing Cx43CT-binding proteins via mass spectrometry has been described earlier (26Singh D. Lampe P.D. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2003; 10: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Cx43CT bound on glutathione-coated beads was incubated with NRK cell lysates. After washing, Cx43CT and any potential interacting proteins were eluted from the beads using either 6 m urea or cleavage at the thrombin site engineered into the fusion protein. The eluted proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by electrospray-MS/MS on a ThermoFinnegan LCQ spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry data of individual peptides was analyzed with SEQUEST™, which identified possible peptide sequence matches by searching recorded MS/MS spectra against a rat sequence data base (30Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 31Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). High scoring peptides were manually inspected to ensure correct matches. GST Pull Down, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—For GST pull down assays, 5 μg of the individual GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Pierce) were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 400 μl of cell lysate (prepared as described above). For immunoprecipitations, rabbit anti-ZO-1, rabbit anti-ZO-2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), rabbit anti-Cx43 (C6219; Sigma), or anti-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) antibodies were incubated with cell lysate for 3 h followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads were washed extensively in PBS, and bound protein was eluted in Laemmli sample buffer followed by separation on SDS-10% PAGE and immunoblotting. For immunoblot detection, rabbit anti-ZO-1, rabbit anti-ZO-2, rabbit anti-Cx43 (C6219; Sigma), or mouse anti-Cx43NT (described in Ref. 32Goldberg G.S. Moreno A.P. Lampe P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36725-36730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were used as primary antibodies and then visualized with fluorescent dye-labeled secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor 680 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and IRDye800-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA); both extensively cross-reacted against other species) and directly quantified using the Li-Cor Biosciences Odyssey infrared imaging system and associated software (inverted images are presented). Confocal Microscopy and Co-localization Analysis—Cultured cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed with PBS, and fixed in chilled methanol/acetone (1:1) for 2 min. Heart tissue was harvested from a mouse; the heart was bisected and frozen in Tissue-TEK OCT compound (Torrance, CA); and 5-μm sections were cut on a cryostat. The sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone and washed in PBS. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, heart sections or cells were incubated with mouse anti-Cx43IF1 (IgG2a; described in Ref. 28Cooper C.D. Lampe P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44962-44968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), rabbit or mouse (IgG1) anti-ZO-1, and/or rabbit anti-ZO-2 antibody for 1 h. After four washes, the cells were incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a, AlexaFluor 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1, and AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Coverslips were washed in PBS and mounted onto slides using DABCO anti-fade medium (25 mg/ml of 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)octane (Sigma) diluted in Spectroglycerol (Eastman Kodak Co.) and 10% PBS, pH 8.6), and images were acquired on a Leica TCS Spectral Confocal Microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning microscope with a ×100 oil objective. For quantitative studies, acquisition parameters were kept identical between the different experimental groups. Colocalization measurements were obtained by three-dimensional analysis of images, using Imaris Coloc (Bitplane Inc., Saint Paul, MN), selecting only the plasma membrane. The values from several images were averaged and are expressed as the percentage of Cx43 co-localized with the ZO proteins. S.D. and standard t test (two-sided) values were calculated. Z-planes and line scan analysis of images were generated using Metamorph 4.6 (Universal Imaging Corp., Westchester, PA). Z-planes were projected from 0.3-μm optical slices, and line scans were 0.9 μm wide. Far Western Overlay Assay—The far Western assay described by Margolis et al. (33Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was employed with minor modifications. GST-Cx43CT (10 μg) bound to glutathione-agarose beads was suspended in kinase buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) to which activated MAP kinase (prepared as described in Ref. 34Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Blu002; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added. After washing the beads with cold PBS, the phosphorylated protein was eluted with 500 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm each of EDTA, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.005% Nonidet P-40 detergent, and 20 mm reduced glutathione. The protein was resuspended in far Western buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% sodium azide, and 2% nonfat dry milk). Cell lysates were separated on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and were transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked in the far Western buffer and incubated with the radiolabeled GST-Cx43CT probe overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen. Densitometry of autoradiographs was performed with NIH Image (a public domain program developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) on images collected with a Sharp JX-325 scanner. In some experiments, the same blot was also probed with antibodies to ZO-1 and ZO-2 as described above and quantified using the Li-Cor system. Cx43 Associates with ZO-2—The C-terminal region of Cx43 contains multiple putative protein interaction motifs and several phosphorylation sites that have been shown to regulate protein function. We employed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as a screen to identify Cx43-interacting partners in a pull down experiment. The C-terminal tail (amino acids 246-382) of Cx43 fused to a GST tag (Cx43CT) was incubated with NRK cell lysates, and bound proteins were precipitated, washed, eluted, trypsinized, and subjected to MS/MS. The mass spectra were analyzed using SEQUEST, an algorithm that correlates the experimental mass spectrum data with theoretical spectra generated from known protein sequences in a data base and ranks the “fit” with X-correlation and Delta Cn values (30Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Our mass spectrometry-based approach identified numerous proteins that potentially interact with the C-terminal tail of Cx43. In a preliminary report associated with the 2003 International Gap Junction Conference, we identified 19 possible interacting proteins (26Singh D. Lampe P.D. Cell Commun. Adhes. 2003; 10: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Four have been reported to interact with Cx43, including protein kinase Cα, casein kinase 1, tubulin, and ZO-1 (4Giepmans B.N.

Vlahos C.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 789-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another ZO family member, ZO-2, was identified with the highest degree of certainty of the group. Two distinct ZO-2 peptides were identified, STGDITAAGVTEANKEPR (P1) and VVDTLYDGK (P2), with high X-correlation (3.53 and 2.54) and Delta Cn values (0.58 and 0.47), respectively. These sequences are absent in other ZO proteins; the sequence of P1 is found in the interdomain region between PDZ2 and PDZ3, whereas P2 falls in the Src homology 3 domain region of ZO-2. The PDZ2 Domain of ZO-2 Interacts with the C-terminal End of CT in GST Pull-down Assays—To assess the ZO-2 interaction with Cx43, we incubated Cx43CT bound to glutathione beads with NRK cell lysates for 1 h. After extensive washing of the beads, the bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, and the presence of ZO-2 was examined via Western analysis. The antibody for ZO-2 detected a strong band at the expected molecular size (160 kDa) when GST-Cx43CT was incubated with NRK cell lysates but not with GST alone (Fig. 1A). To map the minimal domain of Cx43 that interacted with ZO-2, we prepared several mutant constructs of Cx43CT, including a truncation lacking the last 3 and 8 residues (T379 and T374), a deletion of residues 364-373 (Δ369), a deletion of residues 280-300 (Δ290), and a deletion lacking 320-340 (Δ330). In Fig. 1A, we show that ZO-2 bound to full-length Cx43CT, to Δ290, and to Δ330 but neither to Δ369, T379, nor T374. Thus, similar to ZO-1 (18Sorgen P.L. Duffy H.S. Sahoo P. Coombs W. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54695-54701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), ZO-2 appears to bind to the most C-terminal residues of Cx43 but in a manner dependent on residues up to 20 from the C terminus. Other reports have shown that sequences C-terminal to the 3-amino acid PDZ domain-binding motif can influence binding to PDZ domains (10Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). We next determined which region of ZO-2 bound to full-length Cx43. Lysates of NRK cells were incubated with GST fusions of the three separate PDZ1,-2, and -3 regions of the ZO-2 molecule bound to glutathione beads (Fig. 1B). After extensive washing of the beads, bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, and Western analysis for Cx43 was performed. Connexin signal was only detected in the lane where the fusion protein containing PDZ2 was used and not with PDZ1, PDZ3, or GST alone (Fig. 1B). Cellular Cx43 and ZO-2 Interact—We sought to determine whether cellular Cx43 complexes with endogenous ZO-2 in NRK cells. We immunoprecipitated ZO-2 from NRK cell lysates using an anti-ZO-2 antibody and immunoblotted for Cx43 (Fig. 2A). Cellular Cx43 appears as several bands. The bands of lower electrophoretic mobility correspond to phosphorylated forms of Cx43 and are often labeled as P1 and P2, whereas species that co-migrate with the nonphosphorylated band have the highest mobility (P0). Unidentified Cx43 phosphorylation events have been associated with the formation of gap junction plaques (36Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 37Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1357-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). A strong Cx43 signal was observed in lanes representing whole cell lysate, ZO-1 immunoprecipitate (which served as a positive control) and the ZO-2 immunoprecipitate. No signal was observed when a control antibody (to Myc) or protein A beads alone were incubated with the cell lysate. We also immunoprecipitated Cx43 and immunoblotted for ZO-2 (Fig. 2B). ZO-2 was detected in the whole cell lysate and when Cx43 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation but not when the Myc antibody or Protein A beads alone was used. ZO-2 Co-localizes with Cx43 in NRK Cells and Heart—To show whether ZO-2 could interact with Cx43 prior to cellular lysis, we performed co-immunolabeling using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3, ZO-2 and Cx43 are predominately localized to the plasma membrane in NRK cells and were frequently but not exclusively co-localized at cell-cell contacts in punctuate staining patterns reminiscent of gap junctions (shown in all three dimensions by superimposing the signal for Cx43 and ZO-2 as shown in the Overlay panel). We also performed high resolution immunofluorescence to determine whether Cx43 and ZO-2 can co-localize in the intercalated disk region of heart tissue (Fig. 3). Distinct co-localization of Cx43 and ZO-2 was frequently demonstrated in the x-y, x-z, and y-z planes. In both NRK cells and heart tissue, comparison of the individual channels (i.e. Cx43 and ZO-2) indicates that they often coincidentally increase in intensity (i.e. signal strength and shape for each channel are related), indicating bona fide co-localization. However, fluorescence co-localization studies are limited by the resolution of light, so we cannot tell whether the apparent interaction is direct or not. ZO-2 Can Bind Directly to Cx43—ZO-1 is known to form independent complexes with ZO-2 and ZO-3 at tight junctions (38Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and thus, ZO-2 could be interacting indirectly with Cx43 via its interacting partner ZO-1. To investigate the specificity of the ZO-Cx43 interaction further, we employed a far Western analysis. Western blots of lysates from GW1HA-ZO-2-transfected and untransfected 293-T cells were incubated with a radiolabeled Cx43CT probe. The Cx43CT probe bound to a 160-kDa protein only in the lane of the 293-T cells transfected with HA-ZO-2 (Fig. 4, FW panel, + lane). Western analysis of the same blot using ZO-2 antibodies indicated that this band corresponds to the exogenously expressed ZO-2 (IB panel, lower portion). Untransfected 293-T cells contain only low levels of intrinsic ZO-1 (IB panel, upper portion) and ZO-2 (IB side, lower panel, - lane), so essentially no detectable radiolabeled probe was bound. Thus, Cx43 only bound to ZO-2 that was ectopically expressed in the 293-T cells. This confirmed that the binding of Cx43 with ZO-2 was specific and direct. ZO-1 and ZO-2 Bind Differentially to Cx43 during the Cell Cycle—Since both ZO-1 and ZO-2 can bind to the same region of Cx43, we compared their co-localization at different stages of the cell cycle to potentially elucidate distinct roles. As shown in Fig. 5A, Cx43, ZO-1, and ZO-2 interact extensively during G0 (Cx43 (green) + ZO-1 (blue) + ZO-2 (red) = white in the overlay),"

Elucidation of the precise structure and function of various neuronal nAChRs in vivo is particularly challenging, in part because of the scarcity of ligands selective for specific receptor subtypes.The venoms of predatory cone snails (Conus) represent a rich combinatorial-like library of evolutionarily selected, neuropharmacologically active peptides (18McIntosh J.M.

Each Conus venom appears to contain a unique set of 50–200 small disulfide-bonded peptides that target receptors and ion channels in a highly subtype-selective manner. For peptides where function has been determined, three classes of targets have been elucidated: voltage-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, and ligand-gated ion channels (19Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most conserved feature of cone snail venom is the α-conotoxins; these are a series of structurally and functionally related peptides that target nAChRs. Every venom examined thus far has its own distinct complement of nicotinic receptor antagonists, suggesting that, within the genus, there are literally thousands of novel peptides that act on nAChRs. A major advance in recent years in the neuropharmacology of nAChRs has been the ability to characterize particular neuronal subtypes more readily by using specific conotoxins.We now report the cloning of a gene encoding a novel peptide of the α-conotoxin family from Conus pergrandis, α-conotoxin PeIA (α-CTx PeIA). As far as we are aware, this is the first toxin to be characterized from this species found in deep waters (50–530 meters) of the Western Pacific. We show that the peptide has unusual targeting specificity; it has high affinity for recombinant α9α10-containing nAChR receptors and can readily discriminate this α-bungarotoxin-sensitive receptor from the neuronal α7 α-bungarotoxin-sensitive receptor. In addition, α-CTx PeIA blocks native cochlear hair cell nAChRs with a high potency, demonstrating an in vivo target for the peptide. Thus, α-CTx PeIA can be used to discern selectively between α9α10- and α7-mediated functions at those sites where both types of receptors are expressed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIdentification and Sequencing of Genomic Clones Encoding α-CTx PeIA—Genomic DNA was prepared from 50 mg of C. pergrandis hepatopancreas using a Gentra PUREGENE DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. It was used as a template for PCR with oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved intron and 3′-untranslated region sequences of α-conotoxin prepropeptides. The resulting PCR products were purified using a High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Applied Science). The eluted DNA fragments were annealed to pAMP1 vector, and the resulting products were transformed into competent DH5α cells using the CloneAmp pAMP System for rapid cloning of amplification products (Invitrogen). The nucleic acid sequences of the resulting α-CTx-encoding clones were determined according to the standard protocol for automated sequencing.Chemical Synthesis—α-CTx PeIA (0.45 mmol/g) was synthesized on an amide resin using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and standard side protection, except on cysteine residues. Cys residues were protected in pairs with either S-trityl on Cys2 and Cys8, or S-acetamidomethyl on Cys3 and Cys16. The peptide was removed from the resin and precipitated. A two-step oxidation protocol was used to fold the peptides selectively as described previously (20Walker C.S. Steel D. Jacobsen R.B. Lirazan M.B. Cruz L.J. Hooper D. Shetty R. DelaCruz R.C. Nielsen J.S. Zhou L.M. Bandyopadhyay P. Craig A.G. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30664-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, the disulfide bridge between Cys2 and Cys8 was closed by dripping the peptide into an equal volume of 20 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5. The solution was allowed to react for 30 min, and the monocyclic peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Simultaneous removal of the S-acetamidomethyl groups and closure of the disulfide bridge between Cys3 and Cys16 were carried out by iodine oxidation. The monocyclic peptide and HPLC eluent were dripped into an equal volume of iodine (10 mm) in H2O:trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile (78:2:20 by volume) and allowed to react for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ascorbic acid, diluted 20-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the bicyclic peptide was purified by HPLC on a reverse-phase C18 Vydac column using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile, remainder H2O.Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry was utilized.Expression of Recombinant Receptors in Xenopus laevis Oocytes— Capped cRNAs were in vitro transcribed from linearized rat plasmid DNA templates using the mMessage mMachine Transcription Kit (Ambion Corporation, Austin, TX). The maintenance of X. laevis as well as the preparation and cRNA injection of stage V and VI oocytes has been described in detail elsewhere (21Katz E. Verbitsky M. Rothlin C. Vetter D. Heinemann S. Elgoyhen A. Hearing Res. 2000; 141: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Typically, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of RNase-free water containing 0.01–1.0 ng of cRNAs (at a 1:1 molar ratio when pairwise combined) and maintained in Barth's solution at 17 °C.Electrophysiological recordings were performed 2–6 days after cRNA injection under two-electrode voltage clamp with an OC-725B oocyte clamp (Warner Instruments, Wamden, CT). Both voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of ∼1–2 megohms. Data were digitized, stored on a PC, and analyzed using Clamp Fit from the pClamp 6 software (Axon Instruments Corp., Union City, CA). During electrophysiological recordings, oocytes were superfused continuously (∼10 ml/min) with normal frog saline (comprising, in mm) 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, and voltage-clamped at –70 mV. To follow the same conditions we have employed previously to analyze the properties of α9α10 nAChRs (7Elgoyhen A.B. Vetter D. Katz E. Rothlin C. Heinemann S. Boulter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3501-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), when expressing α9α10, experiments were performed in oocytes incubated with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (100 μm) for 3–4 h prior to electrophysiological recordings. Drugs were applied in the perfusion solution of the oocyte chamber. All toxin solutions also contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific adsorption of peptide. The toxin was preapplied for 10 min prior to the addition of the agonist. For the construction of the inhibition curves, the concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) used was near the corresponding EC50 for each receptor; i.e. α9α10, 10 μm; α7, 100 μm; α3β2, 10 μm; α3β4, 100 μm; α4β2, 10 μm.Recordings from Inner Hair Cells—Apical turns of the organ of Corti were excised from Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal ages 8–10 days. Cochlear preparations were mounted under an Axioskope microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany), and viewed with differential interference contrast using a 63 × water immersion objective and a camera with contrast enhancement (Hamamatsu C2400-07, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Methods to record from inner hair cells were essentially as described previously (22Glowatzki E. Fuchs P. Science. 2000; 288: 2366-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, inner hair cells were identified visually, by the size of their capacitance (7–12 picofarads) and by their characteristic voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ currents, including at older ages a fast activating K+-conductance (23Kros C.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Rusch A. Nature. 1998; 394: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Some cells were removed to access inner hair cells, but mostly the pipette moved through the tissue using positive fluid flow to clear the tip. The extracellular solution was as follows (in mm): 155 NaCl, 5.8 KCl, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.9 MgCl2, 0.7 NaH2PO4, 5.6 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The pipette solution was (in mm): 150 KCl, 3.5 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 10 BAPTA, 5 HEPES, 2.5 Na2ATP, pH 7.2. Glass pipettes (1.2-mm inner diameter) had resistances of 7–10 megohms. Cells were held at a holding potential of –90 mV. Postsynaptic currents caused by the spontaneous release of ACh from efferent synaptic terminals contacting inner hair cells were occasionally observed. Therefore, to study the effect of the toxin on synaptic currents in these cells, transmitter release from efferent endings was accelerated by depolarization using 25 mm external potassium saline. In this case, the pipette solution was (in mm): 150 KCl, 3.5 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 2.5 Na2ATP, pH 7.2. Solutions containing 60 μm ACh (the EC50 in this preparation) or elevated potassium (25 mm K+) and the toxin were applied by a gravity-fed multichannel glass pipette (∼150-μm tip diameter) positioned about 300 μm from the recorded inner hair cell. All toxin solutions also contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific adsorption of peptide. The extracellular solution containing the drugs was similar to that described above, except that Mg2+ was omitted, and the Ca2+ concentration was lowered to 0.5 mm to optimize the experimental conditions for measuring currents flowing through the α9α10 receptors (24Katz E. Elgoyhen A.B. Gomez-Casati M.E. Knipper M. Vetter D.E. Fuchs P.A. Glowatzki E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7814-7820Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 25Weisstaub N. Vetter D. Elgoyhen A. Katz E. Hearing Res. 2002; 167: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To minimize the contribution of SK channel currents, 1 nm apamin, a specific SK channel blocker, was added to the external working solutions. Currents in inner hair cells were recorded in the whole-cell patch clamp mode using (Axopatch 200B amplifier) low pass filtered at 2–10 kHz and digitized at 5–20 kHz with a Digidata 1200 board (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Recordings were made at room temperature (22–25 °C). Voltages were not corrected for the voltage drop across the uncompensated series resistance.For constructing the inhibition curves, both in oocytes and the cochlear preparation, the average peak amplitude of three control responses just before the exposure to the toxin was used to normalize the amplitude of each test response in the presence of the toxin. Each data point of the inhibition curves represents the average value ± S.E. of measurements from at least three experiments. Curves were fitted with Equation 1, %response=100|(1+([T]/IC50)nH)(Eq. 1) where nH is the Hill coefficient, [T] is the concentration of toxin, and IC50 is the concentration of toxin which reduces to 50% the maximal response to ACh.Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test (two-tailed, unpaired samples). A p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSCloning of α-CTx PeIA—Although the mature α-CTx sequences are highly variable, the organization of their encoding genes is constant across species. The α-CTxs are proteolytically cleaved from a larger precursor protein. This prepropeptide is ∼40 amino acids long, with the mature α-CTx moiety of ∼13–18 amino acids located at the carboxyl terminus of the precursor. A basic amino acid, immediately preceding the mature toxin in the precursor sequence, acts as a processing site. In contrast to the highly variable sequence of the mature toxins, the precursor proteins of α-CTxs are highly conserved. The signal sequence region is practically invariant among the different α-CTx precursors, even in distantly related Conus species. Also, sequence segments in the 3′-untranslated region of the α-CTx mRNA and in the intron immediately preceding the toxin sequence are similarly conserved (18McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We utilized conserved intronic and 3′-untranslated region sequences of the α-CTx gene structure to design oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of the α-CTx-coding region. The resulting sequence from C. pergrandis is shown in Fig. 1. The toxin was named α-CTx PeIA (“Pe” designating the species, pergrandis; Roman numeral “I” to designate the canonical α-CTx disulfide bond pattern; and “A” to indicate that it is the first α-CTx reported from this species).Chemical Synthesis of α-CTx PeIA—Solid phase chemical synthesis of the predicted mature toxin was performed. In synthesizing the peptide, it was assumed that the disulfide bridging pattern of α-CTx PeIA was the same as all previously characterized α-CTxs, that is, Cys2 to Cys8 and Cys3 to Cys16 (18McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The glycine at the carboxyl terminus was assumed to be post-translationally modified to a carboxyl-terminal amide. Cys groups were orthogonally protected in pairs to direct disulfide bond formation. Acid-labile S-trityl groups were removed simultaneously with peptide cleavage from the resin, and closure of the disulfide bridge between these Cys residues was accomplished with FeCN. The single-bridge peptide was purified by HPLC, and the acid-stable acetomidomethyl groups were removed; the disulfide bridges formed by iodine oxidation. The bicyclic peptide was subsequently purified by HPLC and analyzed with MALDI mass spectrometry. The mass of the synthetic peptide was consistent with the amidated sequence (monoisotopic MH+: calculated, 1651.62; observed, 1651.6). This synthesized toxin was utilized in all subsequent experiments.Effect of α-CTx PeIA on ACh-evoked Currents through nAChRs—Conotoxins have been used widely as a pharmacological tool to characterize neuronal nAChRs (26Nicke A. Wonnacott S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2305-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to analyze the effects of α-CTx PeIA on different nAChRs. Fig. 2A shows representative responses of X. laevis oocytes expressing either the α-bungarotoxin-sensitive α9α10 or α7 nAChRs to ACh and blockage of responses in the presence of α-CTx PeIA. Complete block of ACh-evoked currents was obtained with 0.3 μm α-CTx PeIA in the case of α9α10 compared with 100 μm in the case of α7 nAChRs. As derived from the inhibition curves in Fig. 2B, currents elicited by ACh in α9α10 nAChRs were potently blocked by α-CTx PeIA with a mean IC50 and S.E. of 6.9 ± 0.5 nm (n = 6). In the case of α7, the IC50 value, 1.8 ± 0.1 μm (n = 5), was 260-fold higher than that obtained for α9α10, thus indicating a high degree of selectivity of the toxin for α9α10. The blockage produced by α-CTx PeIA on both types of receptors was reversible after washing with saline solution. Fig. 3 shows the washout kinetics in the case of α9α10. The effect of α-CTx PeIA was reversed relatively rapidly: >50% recovery in 3 min, and total recovery after 12–15 min.Fig. 2Effect of α-CTx PeIA on α9α10 and α7 nAChRs. A, representative traces of the response to ACh either alone or in the presence of α-CTx PeIA. B, inhibition curves performed by the coapplication of 10 μm (α9α10) or 100 μm ACh (α7) and increasing concentrations of α-CTx PeIA. Oocytes were incubated with each concentration of the toxin for 10 min prior to the addition of ACh. Peak current values are plotted, expressed as the percentage of the peak control current evoked by ACh. The mean ± S.E. of five to six experiments/group are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Wash-out kinetics of α-CTx PeIA from α9α10 receptors. After a control response to 10 μm ACh was obtained, 1 μm α-CTx PeIA was applied to α9α10-expressing oocytes for 10 min. The oocyte was then perfused continuously with saline solution without toxin while responses to ACh were recorded. Similar results were obtained in three other experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cochlear outer and developing inner hair cells are the main targets of descending cholinergic olivocochlear efferent fibers (27Guinan J.J. Dallos P. Popper A.N. Fay R.R. The Cochlea. Springer-Verlag, New York1996: 435-502Google Scholar). The efferent fibers-hair cell synapse is most likely mediated by α9α10 nAChRs (7Elgoyhen A.B.

Genomics. 2001; 73: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), providing one of the few postsynaptic functions for non-muscle nAChRs. However, α7 transcripts as well as α7 immunostaining have been reported in the mammalian organ of Corti (30Morley B.J. Li H.S. Hiel H. Drescher D.G. Elgoyhen A.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 53: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Luebke A. Assoc. Res. Otolaryn. Abstr. 1995; 18: 193Google Scholar). Recordings from inner hair cells are an excellent tool to evaluate the effects of the toxin in native hair cell nAChRs. As shown in Fig. 4A, α-CTx PeIA potently blocked ACh-evoked responses in inner hair cells. The IC50 value obtained, 4.4 ± 0.5 nm, was similar to that found in recombinant α9α10 receptors, thus confirming the α9α10 identity of this nAChR.Fig. 4Effect of α-CTx PeIA on ACh-evoked currents of inner hair cells. A, representative traces of 60 μm ACh either alone or in the presence of α-CTx PeIA. B, inhibition curves performed by the coapplication of 60 μm ACh and increasing concentrations of α-CTx PeIA.

Transmitter released in a synaptic cleft, in close proximity to postsynaptic receptors, reaches millimolar ranges, sufficient to activate in the millisecond range receptors with a low affinity active state and a fast desensitization rate (32Le Novere N. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the effect of α-CTx PeIA on synaptic currents evoked by the release of presynaptic ACh in the presence of 25 mm KCl. As observed in Fig. 5, 30 nm α-CTx PeIA also blocked responses to synaptically released ACh, thus indicating that the toxin is a valuable tool to examine in vivo responses mediated through α9α10 receptors. Fig. 5A shows K+-evoked synaptic currents either in the absence or presence of α-CTx PeIA. The blocking effect of the toxin was rapidly reversible upon washing the preparation. The effect of α-CTx PeIA was a reduction of the amplitude (Fig. 5B) of the synaptic currents (from 57.0 ± 0.7 pA with 997 events and 3 cells, to 37.5 ± 0.7 pA with 766 events and 3 cells, p < 0.0001). This result confirms a postsynaptic effect of the toxin on the nAChRs present in cochlear hair cells. A reduction in the frequency of events (from 2.2 ± 0.5 to 1.2 ± 0.2 Hz, data not shown) was observed. This could be either because the blocking action of the toxin on the synaptic events of small amplitudes could not be resolved within the noise of the recordings or because of an additional presynaptic effect of the toxin. The latter was not investigated further.Fig. 5Effect of α-CTx PeIA on inner hair cell synaptic currents. A, representative traces of the effect of 30 nm α-CTx PeIA on synaptic currents evoked by 25 mm KCl. The insets show synaptic currents on an expanded time scale. B, bar diagram showing the effect of 30 nm α-CTx PeIA on the amplitude of synaptic currents. The recordings are from three independent inner hair cells, and the number of analyzed events were 997 and 766, either in the absence or the presence of α-CTx PeIA, respectively. The star denotes a significant difference, p < 0.0001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess the effect of α-CTx PeIA on non-α-bungarotoxin-sensitive neuronal nAChRs, concentration-response analysis was conducted on rat α2β4, α2β2, α4β2, α4β4, α3β2, and α3β4 (Fig. 6 and Table I). The toxin had little or no activity when bath-applied on α2β4, α2β2, and α4β4 nAChRs at concentrations as high as 10 μm. The percent response ± S.E. to ACh was, respectively, 98.2 ± 2.1%, 95.3 ± 1.9%, and 91.4 ± 2.3% (n = 3). Only a 39.2 ± 5.5% (n = 4) block of α4β2 was observed in the presence of 10 μm α-CTx PeIA. On the other hand, α-CTx PeIA appeared to be effective on α3-containing receptors, displaying a higher selectivity for α3β2 (IC50 = 23 ± 1 nm, n = 5) than for α3β4 (IC50 = 0.48 ± 0.03 μm, n = 4) nAChRs. α-CTx PeIA was also tested on rat α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs, where α6/α3is a chimeric α subunit containing the amino-terminal 237 amino acids of α6 and the remainder of α3 (33Azam L.

https://openalex.org/W2028204954,"Deposition of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in senile or diffuse plaques is a distinctive feature of Alzheimer's disease. The role of Aβ aggregates in the etiology of the disease is still controversial. The formation of linear aggregates, known as amyloid fibrils, has been proposed as the onset and the cause of pathological deposition. Yet, recent findings suggest that a more crucial role is played by prefibrillar oligomeric assemblies of Aβ that are highly toxic in the extracellular environment. In the present work, the mechanism of protofibril formation is studied at pH 3.1, starting from a solution of oligomeric precursors. By combining static light scattering and photon correlation spectroscopy, the growth of the mass and the size of aggregates are determined at different temperatures. Analysis and scaling of kinetic data reveal that under the studied conditions protofibrils are formed via a single non-cooperative elongation mechanism, not prompted by nucleation. This process is well described as a linear colloidal aggregation due to diffusion and coalescence of growing aggregates. The rate of elongation follows an Arrhenius law with an activation enthalpy of 15 kcal mol–1. Such a value points to a conformational change of peptides or oligomers being involved in binding to protofibrils or in general to a local reorganization of each aggregate. These results contribute to establishing a clearer relation at the molecular level between the fibrillation mechanism and fibrillar precursors. The observation of a non-cooperative aggregation pathway supports the hypothesis that amyloid formation may represent an escape route from a dangerous condition, induced by the presence of toxic oligomeric species.

The observation of a non-cooperative aggregation pathway supports the hypothesis that amyloid formation may represent an escape route from a dangerous condition, induced by the presence of toxic oligomeric species. A clear hallmark of Alzheimer disease is the presence in the brain of extracellular amyloid plaques containing a certain amount of cleavage products of the transmembrane amyloid β-protein precursor (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). These are small peptides of 39–42 residues with a hydrophobic domain at the C terminus. They have been found in the core of senile plaques in typical linear aggregates, known as amyloid fibrils. Similar amyloid fibrils made from different proteins or peptides are associated with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson and Huntington diseases, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (2Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). More generally, a large class of proteins is able to assemble into a fibrillar structure under appropriate conditions that typically favor misfolded or partially unfolded conformations (3Lansbury Jr., P.T.

Podlisny M.B. Annu. Rev. Genomics Human Genetics. 2002; 3: 67-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, the amount of amyloid deposits is poorly correlated with pathology, which seems to be primarily related to a synaptic dysfunction preceding neuronal degeneration (7Terry R.D. Masliah E.

These findings have changed the current perspective on the role of amyloid fibrils in neurodegenerative diseases to consider fibrils to be a means of removing dangerous toxic oligomeric species rather than an active pathogenic product (18Stefani M.

It is still an open question whether such protofibrillar aggregates are on-pathway intermediates in the fibrillogenesis process. However, a certain correlation between their reduction in number and the appearance of mature fibrils has been noticed (29Gorman P.M. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 743-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present work, we study the assembly of amyloid aggregates starting from a solution of Aβ(1–40) at pH 3.1 containing a distribution of oligomers. Our central issue concerns the mechanism of aggregation in the early stage of kinetics when oligomers assemble into protofibrils (28Huang T.H.J. Yang D.S. Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), i.e. structures observed before or during the formation of mature amyloid fibrils (34Kheterpal I. Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14092-14098Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To focus on the details of the assembly mechanism and to develop a reasonable model for protofibril formation, we chose to work at acid pH, a condition that allows easy seed-free preparations and, hence, reproducible kinetics (35Lomakin A.

Also, at this pH the overall process occurs on a time scale that is suitable to be studied over a wide range of temperatures (37Kusumoto Y. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12277-12282Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the human body Aβ assembly occurs in a very complex environment, characterized by a given pH, a low peptide concentration, and the presence of certain amount of different proteins, membranes, metal ions, and other biomolecular objects. In vitro experiments are performed on extremely simplified conditions to highlight a few basic features of the molecular interactions and mechanisms that drive amyloid fibrillogenesis. At physiological pH Aβ(1–40) forms small oligomers (of a few units) (24Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that at pH 2, peptides may coexist with spherocylindrical micelles that act as nuclei for fibrillogenesis (35Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc.

Our light scattering experiments have shown that the initial oligomers, with an average aggregation number of 75 Aβ(1–40), assemble into elongated linear structures, consistent with previous observations (28Huang T.H.J.

Scaling of kinetic data at different temperatures on a single master curve reveals that the same mechanism of aggregation operates between 27 and 67 °C: aggregation proceeds via diffusion and coalescence of clusters and not just by addition of a single monomer to fibrils, as has often been reported under other conditions (35Lomakin A.

Interestingly, these experiments go beyond the classic scheme of protein polymerization (41Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Proteins.

In the present work, amyloid formation occurs via a non-cooperative coagulation process, which closely resembles linear colloidal aggregation (33Xu S. Bevis B. Arnsdorf M.F. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Preparation of Peptide Solutions—Samples of 1 mg of Aβ(1–40) powder (purchased from Anaspec, Inc.) were dissolved in 0.2 ml of trifluoroacetic acid and gently stirred at 5 °C for 3 h to completely dissolve associated peptides (48Shen C.L. Fitzgerald M.C. Murphy R.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1238-1246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 49Crescenzi O. Tomaselli S. Guerrini R. Salvadori S. D'Ursi A.M. Temussi P.A. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5642-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Upon addition of 1.8 ml of Millipore SuperQ water, solutions were fractionated into five equal parts and lyophilized overnight. This procedure provided stock powder aliquots of the same amount (200 μg). Each aliquot was dissolved in 250 μl of 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer at pH 3.1 and filtered (via a 0.2-μm Millipore filter) into 1-cm square quartz cuvettes or 1-mm cylindrical capillaries. Different peptide concentrations were obtained by diluting the stock powder aliquots by a different amount of buffer solution. All chemicals were reagent grade. Verification of Seed-free Condition—Pretreatment with trifluoroacetic acid and filtering ensured that no large aggregates (seeds) were present in solution (49Crescenzi O. Tomaselli S. Guerrini R. Salvadori S. D'Ursi A.M. Temussi P.A. Picone D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5642-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This was readily verified at the beginning of each experiment by quasielastic light scattering measurements, which are very sensitive to high molecular weight objects. The high reproducibility of our kinetics further confirmed the absence of a significant amount of spurious nucleation centers within our peptide solutions, before and after filtering. Concentration Determination—Concentration was determined by measuring tyrosine absorbance at 276 nm (extinction coefficient: 1390 cm–1 m–1) with a Jasco J-530 spectrometer (50Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). Peptide concentrations were 185 μm for the main set of experiments. Considering that the molecular mass of Aβ(1–40) is 4.3 kDa, the final concentrations were consistent with those calculated assuming the initial nominal peptide amount of 1 mg, in purchased vials. This confirmed that no material was lost through filtering and that peptide was efficiently dissolved via the trifluoroacetic acid treatment. Quasielastic Light Scattering—Time-resolved light scattering experiments were performed at different temperatures, immediately after sample dissolution in buffer at pH 3.1. Samples were placed in a thermostatted cell compartment of a Brookhaven Instruments BI200-SM goniometer, equipped with a 100-milliwatt argon laser tuned at λ0 = 514.5 nm. The temperature was controlled within 0.05 °C with a thermostatted recirculating bath. Scattered light intensity at 90° and its time autocorrelation function, g2(t), were measured simultaneously by using a Brookhaven BI-9000 correlator. Correlation functions g2(t) were analyzed using a constrained regularization method (51Stepanek P. Brown W. Dynamic Light Scattering: The Method and Some Applications. Clarendon Press, Oxford1993: 177-241Google Scholar) to determine the distribution P(D) of the apparent diffusion coefficients D: g2(t) = 1 + |∫ P(D) exp(–Dq2t)dD|2, where q is the scattering vector, defined just below. The z-average hydrodynamic radius Rh was calculated by taking the z-average diffusion coefficient Dz and assuming the Stokes-Einstein relation: kBTDz–1 = 6πηRh, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and η is the solvent viscosity (52Berne B.J. Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering. Wiley-Interscience, New York1976Google Scholar). Multiple Angle Light Scattering—The experimental set-up described for QLS experiments was also used for static light scattering measurements. Multiple angle experiments were performed to determine the scattered intensity I(q) at different scattering vectors q = 4πnλ0–1 sin(ϑ/2), where ϑ is the scattering angle and n is the medium refractive index (52Berne B.J. Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering. Wiley-Interscience, New York1976Google Scholar). Absolute values for the scattered intensity (Rayleigh ratios) were obtained by normalization with respect to toluene, whose Rayleigh ratio at 514.5 nm was taken as 32 × 10–6 cm–1. Optical Microscopy—At the end of the scattering experiments, a few drops of solution were put on a glass slide for imaging with a phase-contrast Zeiss Axioskop2 plus microscope. Onset of Kinetics: Mass and Size of Oligomers—Peptides were dissolved into pH 3.1 buffer to obtain the final concentration of 185 μm. After dissolution, QLS measurements reveal the presence of small size oligomers in the solution, along with a negligible amount of large size aggregates (more than hundreds of nanometers). Apart from this, the distribution of hydrodynamic radii is unimodal with a mean value of Rh = 7 nm and a total range 4–15 nm (Fig. 1a). Measurement of the intensity scattered at 90° (scattering vector q = 23 μm–1) provides the Rayleigh ratio IR(q) that is related to the weight average molecular mass (M̄w) by the relation: IR(q) = 4π2n2(dn/dc)2λ0–4NA–1cM̄wPz(q), with c the mass concentration, NA Avogadro's number, and Pz(q) the z-averaged form factor (52Berne B.J. Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering. Wiley-Interscience, New York1976Google Scholar). By taking dn/dc = 0.18 cm3g–1, and Pz(q) = 1 (because the initial size of oligomers is much smaller than q–1), we obtain a weight average molecular mass M̄w = 330 ± 60 kDa. Considering that the molecular mass of a single Aβ(1–40) is 4.3 kDa, the soluble oligomers found at the onset of kinetics are made up on average of 75 (± 15) peptides, and they have a mean hydrodynamic radius of 7 nm. The same results have been obtained at each temperature used: 27, 37, 42, 47, 52, 57, and 67 °C. We remark that the weight average molecular mass measured by light scattering experiments is defined as M̄w = ΣsMscs/c, where Ms and cs are, respectively, the molecular mass and the mass concentration of oligomers composed of s peptides. Therefore, a certain amount of single peptides could be present in the solution even if not clearly observable by light scattering measurements, which are more sensitive to large mass objects. The tolerance in the analysis of dynamic light scattering at the initial stage of kinetics allows us to put an upper limit of ∼0.4% for the contribution of monomers to scattered intensity. Consequently, in this limit condition, the mass concentration of monomers would be ∼30%, and the actual average aggregation number of the oligomeric species would rise up to 110 units. Early Stages of Kinetics at Different Temperatures—QLS experiments were performed at different temperatures and at the concentration of 185 μm focusing on the early stage of the kinetics. The time dependence of the 90° scattered intensity IR(q) is shown in Fig. 2a for different temperatures. Data were normalized with respect to the initial intensity I0(q) due to scattering by the initial oligomer distribution. The distribution of hydrodynamic radii at T = 37 °C is shown for selected different times in Fig. 1. For each temperature studied, the distribution remains unimodal over time while its standard deviation and the mean value increase, so that their ratio (which is a measure of the polydispersity) is essentially stationary. The kinetics of the mean hydrodynamic radius is reported in Fig. 2b for each temperature. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2a, the intensity starts increasing with no lag time. Such growth continues with a temperature-dependent rate and eventually saturates, while the growth of the hydrodynamic radii exhibits no reduction. The saturation of the intensity signal is due to the fact that the scattered intensity is proportional to the average mass of aggregates times the form factor P(q), thus, II0=M¯wP(q)M¯w0P0(q)(Eq. 1) where M̄w is the weight average molecular mass and the subscript '0′ refers to the zero time quantities. During the aggregation process, the average molecular mass increases so that aggregate size becomes larger than the reciprocal scattering vector q = 23 μm–1 and the form factor decreases: P(q) < 1. Empirical Fit and Scaling of Kinetics—The intensity growth versus time data have a sigmoidal shape on a log-log scale. To describe this behavior, the data were fit to the following empirical expression, II0=1+(tτT)β1+1Δ(tτT)β(Eq. 2) where β = 0.87, Δ = 8.0, and τT = 7.3, 15.5, 26.0, 50.6, 51.2, 129.4, and 293.8 min, respectively, for T = 67, 57, 52, 47, 42, 37, and 27 °C. The exponent β is less than unity, as expected for kinetics with no lag time. The only fitting parameter depending on temperature is the time constant τT, related to an aggregation rate. By plotting the intensity kinetics versus the renormalized time t/τT, the data collapse on the same master curve (Fig. 3a). Remarkably, hydrodynamic radii also scale on a master curve by using the same parameter τT (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the same aggregation mechanism occurs throughout the temperature range studied. Suitable Model for the Form Factor—To obtain a basic explanation of this aggregation mechanism, we need to work out a model to fit the experimental kinetic data. An expression for both the growth of the weight average molecular mass M̄w and for the form factor Pz(q) is required, as is clear from Equation 1. In the present case, we will assume that the shape of aggregates is not critically related to the molecular mass, which is a very reasonable assumption when dealing with polymeric or fibrillar aggregates. Hence, the radius of gyration of aggregates can be written in the following scaling form with respect to the average molecular mass: Rg = Rg0(M̄w/M̄w0)1/d; where Rg0 is the initial z-averaged radius of gyration of the oligomers, and d is an effective fractal dimension. Approximating the form factor with the Fisher-Burford expression (53Nicolai T. Durand D. Gimel J.-C. Brown W. Light Scattering: Principles and Development. Clarendon Press, Oxford1993: 201-231Google Scholar) Pz(q) = [1 + ⅔d–1q2Rg2]–d/2, the time evolution of scattered intensity reads, II0=M¯w[1+23dq2Rg02(M¯w/M¯w0)2/d]-d/2M¯w0[1+23dq2Rg02]-d/2(Eq. 3) Our modeling effort is now devoted to finding an expression for the weight average molecular mass, M̄w. Coagulation Theory—Protein aggregation can be studied in the framework of classic coagulation theory (54Chandrasekhar S. Rev. Mod. Phys. 1943; 15: 1-89Crossref Scopus (5829) Google Scholar), by following an approach that has been widely used for colloids or aerosols (55Family F. Landau D.P. Kinetics of Aggregation and Gelation. North-Holland, Amsterdam1984Crossref Google Scholar, 56Weitz D.A. Huang J.S. Lin M.Y. Sung J. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1984; 53: 1657-1660Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The time-dependent aggregation number distribution can be described by the following Smoluchowski equation, ddtns(t)=12∑i+j=sKi,jni(t)nj(t)-ns(t)∑jKs,jnj(t)(Eq. 4) where ns is the number concentration of a cluster of s units, and Ki,j is the reaction rate of two clusters of i and j units. The two terms in the right-hand side of Equation 4 are, respectively, the production and loss of s-mers by coagulation of two clusters of appropriate size. Here, we are assuming that aggregation is irreversible, so that no fragmentation or evaporation processes occur, and that three-body effects can be neglected. Also, following our discussion above, we do not introduce any nucleation term. By multiplying Equation 4 by sk and summing over all s one obtains"

Giardia intestinalis, often described as the earliest branching eukaryote, contains double membrane-bounded structures involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, an essential function of mitochondria. Here we present evidence that Giardia mitosomes also harbor Cpn60, mtHsp70, and ferredoxin and that despite their advanced state of reductive evolution they have retained vestiges of presequence-dependent and -independent protein import pathways akin to those that operate in mammalian mitochondria. Although import of IscU and ferredoxin is still reliant on their amino-terminal presequences, targeting of Giardia Cpn60, IscS, or mtHsp70 into mitosomes no longer requires cleavable presequences, a derived feature from their mitochondrial homologues. In addition, we found that division and segregation of a single centrally positioned mitosome tightly associated with the microtubular cytoskeleton is coordinated with the cell cycle, whereas peripherally located mitosomes are inherited into daughter cells stochastically."

Resistin is a cysteinerich molecule that circulates as a multimer of a dimeric form dependent upon a single intermolecular disulfide bond, which, in the mouse, involves Cys26; mutation of this residue to alanine (C26A) produces a monomeric molecule that appears to be bioactive in the liver. Remarkably, unlike native resistin, monomeric C26A resistin had no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in mouse cardiomyocytes. Resistin impairs glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes by mechanisms that involve altered vesicle trafficking. Thus, in cardiomyocytes, both mouse and human resistins directly impair glucose transport; and in contrast to effects on the liver, these actions of resistin require oligomerization. The adipocytokine resistin impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in rodents. Here, we examined the effect of resistin on glucose uptake in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. Murine resistin reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, establishing the heart as a resistin target tissue.

The association between obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes is well established, but the mechanisms linking increased adipose tissue mass with insulin resistance are partially understood. There is growing evidence that secreted products from adipocytes such as free fatty acids, tumor necrosis factor-α, leptin, and adiponectin can have significant effects on insulin sensitivity. Resistin is a recently described adipocytokine that was shown to impair glucose tolerance and insulin action in mice in vivo (1Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar, 2Rangwala S.M. Rich A.S. Rhoades B. Shapiro J.S. Obici S. Rossetti L. Lazar M.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1937-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Its expression is negatively regulated by the antidiabetic drugs thiazolidinediones, and serum levels are increased in mice and rats with diet-induced obesity as well as in genetically obese and insulin-resistant mice such as ob/ob and db/db mice, implying that resistin may represent another link between obesity and type 2 diabetes (1Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar, 3Banerjee R.R. Lazar M.A. J. Mol.

Investig. 2004; 114: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The nature of the in vivo targets of resistin is beginning to be elucidated. Acute administration of resistin in vivo impairs the ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production without altering skeletal muscle glucose utilization (5Rajala M.W. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). High fat feeding of rats leads to hyper-resistinemia and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver. Treatment of these animals with a resistin antisense oligonucleotide normalizes hepatic insulin resistance without increasing skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity (4Muse E.D. Obici S. Bhanot S. Monia B.P. McKay R.A. Rajala M.W. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Mice that are null for resistin exhibit reduced hepatic glucose production (6Banerjee R.R. Rangwala S.M. Shapiro J.S. Rich A.S. Rhoades B. Qi Y. Wang J. Rajala M.W. Pocai A. Scherer P.E. Steppan C.M. Ahima R.S. Obici S. Rossetti L. Lazar M.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1195-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Conversely, transgenic overexpression of resistin in mice increases hepatic glucose production without decreasing skeletal muscle glucose utilization (2Rangwala S.M. Rich A.S. Rhoades B. Shapiro J.S. Obici S. Rossetti L. Lazar M.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1937-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the liver is a major target of resistin actions. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of resistin in the adipose tissue of SHR rats leads to dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and impaired insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in muscle (7Pravenec M. Kazdova L. Landa V. Zidek V. Mlejnek P. Jansa P. Wang J. Qi N. Kurtz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45209-45215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, adenovirus-mediated hyper-resistinemia in rats produces similar metabolic defects, which are associated with reduced insulin signaling in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver (8Satoh H. Nguyen M.T. Miles P.D. Imamura T. Usui I. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the skeletal muscle phenotypes in these latter models represent direct effects of resistin or if they are secondary to the effects of resistin on the liver. However, resistin has been shown to directly impair insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation in isolated rat soleus muscle (7Pravenec M. Kazdova L. Landa V. Zidek V. Mlejnek P. Jansa P. Wang J. Qi N. Kurtz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45209-45215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms were not 2elucidated, the previous study suggested that insulin action in skeletal muscle might be directly impaired by resistin in vitro. Studies in cultured cells have also suggested that adipocytes and skeletal muscle may be potential targets of resistin action. For example, exposure of 3T3L1 adipocytes to resistin impairs insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas exposure to anti-resistin IgG augments glucose uptake (1Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). Resistin may impair insulin signaling in 3T3L1 adipocytes by mechanisms involving the up-regulation of SOCS-3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) (9Steppan C.M. Wang J. Whiteman E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Moreover, resistin was recently shown to acutely inhibit glucose uptake in L6 myotubes independent of any changes in proximal insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation (10Moon B. Kwan J.J. Duddy N. Sweeney G. Begum N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E106-E115Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies in primary muscle cells are currently lacking. Resistin is a cysteine-rich protein that, when secreted, circulates as a hexamer composed of two trimers that are linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds (11Patel S.D. Rajala M.W. Rossetti L. Scherer P.E. Shapiro L. Science. 2004; 304: 1154-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A single cysteine at position 26 has been demonstrated to be responsible for the covalent oligomerization of resistin because mutation of this cysteine to alanine (C26A) produces a molecule that exists only in the monomeric form (12Banerjee R.R. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25970-25973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It should be noted that this “monomeric” mutant resistin likely circulates as a trimer that is maintained via protein-protein interactions, but is unable to form the disulfide bond that is necessary to produce the hexamer. In this study, monomeric resistin therefore refers to the C26A mutant that fails to form the disulfide-linked hexamers, and dimeric resistin refers to the wild-type molecule that circulates as the disulfide-linked hexamer. Recent studies have suggested that monomeric resistin is more potent than the hexameric protein in impairing hepatic insulin action (11Patel S.D. Rajala M.W. Rossetti L. Scherer P.E. Shapiro L. Science. 2004; 304: 1154-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Whether or not this is the case for skeletal muscle and adipocytes is unknown. A human homolog of the resistin gene exists, but its biological activity with regard to insulin action has not been characterized. Resistin is secreted from primary adipocytes isolated from subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue depots in humans, and the expression is 4-fold higher in abdominal adipose tissue versus adipose tissue obtained from the thigh (13McTernan C.L. McTernan P.G. Harte A.L. Levick P.L. Barnett A.H. Kumar S. Lancet. 2002; 359: 46-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 14McTernan P.G. McTernan C.L. Chetty R. Jenner K. Fisher F.M. Lauer M.N. Crocker J. Barnett A.H. Kumar S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2407-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Whether or not these regional differences in resistin expression contribute to the association between visceral obesity and insulin resistance is not known. There is also some debate in the literature as to whether or not resistin in humans is secreted primarily from adipocytes, preadipocytes, or other adipose tissue stromal cells (15Fain J.N. Cheema P.S. Bahouth S.W. Lloyd Hiler M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and some studies have failed to show any association between resistin expression in adipocytes and insulin sensitivity (16Janke J. Engeli S. Gorzelniak K. Luft F.C. Sharma A.M. Obes. Res. 2002; 10: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 17Savage D.B. Sewter C.P. Klenk E.S. Segal D.G. Vidal-Puig A. Considine R.V.

Genetic studies that have examined the association between polymorphisms in the 3′- and 5′-flanking regions of the resistin gene have produced variable results with positive associations between resistin variants and insulin resistance and/or obesity found in some but not in other populations (19Ma X.

More recently, data have emerged that hyper-resistinemia occurs in chromic inflammatory states that are associated with insulin resistance (24Kamin D. Hadigan C. Lehrke M. Mazza S.

We have devised techniques for acutely dissociating viable mouse cardiomyocytes that are suitable for evaluation of insulin signaling and glucose transport (27Belke D.D. Betuing S. Tuttle M.J.

Cardiol. 1985; 80: 103-106PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that isolated cardiomyocytes are insulin-responsive and share many characteristics of adipocytes and skeletal muscle in terms of insulin stimulation of glucose transport. Thus, we used this model system to determine whether resistin can modulate glucose transport and insulin signaling in primary murine muscle cells. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of murine and human resistins on glucose transport and to determine whether differences exist between the activity of the dimeric versus monomeric resistin (C26A mutant) in muscle cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies against insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP)1 were a kind gift of Paul F. Pilch (Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA). Antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt (phosphorylated at Ser473) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), respectively. Goat polyclonal antibodies against the GLUT4 glucose transporter were obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Recombinant FLAG, mouse monomeric and dimeric resistin-FLAG, and human dimeric resistin-FLAG were obtained using expression vector pZac2.1 and transfected into 293T cells as described previously (12Banerjee R.R. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25970-25973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In some studies, we also used mouse recombinant resistin obtained using expression vector pFM1 and transfected into 293T cells (5Rajala M.W. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Preparation and Culture of Isolated Cardiomyocytes—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from 10-15-week-old male C57BL/6 mice using our previously described protocols (28Abel E.D. Graveleau C. Betuing S.

Preincubation (5-90 min) of the cells in the absence or presence of resistin was done in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.0 mm glucose, 1 mm pyruvate, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated for 40 min in the presence or absence of 0.1-10 nm insulin in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mm pyruvate. Glucose uptake was performed by adding 0.1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 3.33 nCi/ml 2-[1,2-3H]-deoxy-d-glucose for 30 min. Glucose transport experiments were terminated after 30 min by aspiration of the buffer, followed by two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then lysed in 1 n NaOH for 20 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific uptake was assessed in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B and subtracted from all of the measured values. Radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a Beckman LS 5000 TD instrument and normalized to protein amount measured with a Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). IRAP Biotinylation Assay in Isolated Cardiomyocytes—Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 15 μg/ml FLAG or resistin-FLAG prior to a 40-min incubation in the absence or presence of 10 nm insulin. Cells were then incubated for 40 min at 4 °C in ice-cold PBS containing sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100. An aliquot of the lysate was saved to determine total expression of IRAP. One volume of 160 μl/ml UltraLink™ Plus-immobilized streptavidin was added to the cell lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the pellet was washed three times with ice-cold PBS and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer supplemented with 10% β-mercaptoethanol. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. Total cell lysate and plasma membrane fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-IRAP antibodies (28Abel E.D. Graveleau C. Betuing S. Pham M. Reay P.A. Kandror V. Kupriyanova T. Xu Z. Kandror K.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2491-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Western Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were treated as described in the figure legends. Protein was separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Fisher), and blotted for IRAP using the protocols described previously (28Abel E.D. Graveleau C. Betuing S. Pham M. Reay P.A. Kandror V. Kupriyanova T. Xu Z. Kandror K.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2491-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Determination of GLUT4 Translocation in Cardiomyocytes by Immunofluorescence—Cells plated on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 5 μg/ml resistin prior to a 40-min incubation in the absence or presence of 10 nm insulin. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. After blocking with PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum and 5% saponin (Sigma), cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against GLUT4. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature. Cells were then fixed again in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. After incubation with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin, slides were washed and mounted using VECTASHIELD HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence was analyzed by conventional confocal microscopy (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) using sequential image acquisition after excitation at 488 nm (Alexa 488; emission, 510-530 nm) for GLUT4 and at 633 nm (Alexa 647; emission, >660 nm) for wheat germ agglutinin. Images were recorded in optical slices that were <0.5 μm thick at a resolution of 0.115 μm/pixels. Settings were adjusted so that areas lacking cellular structures appeared essentially black, and the brightest pixels were not saturated. All images were recorded with identical settings. Individual cells were selected randomly based on wheat germ agglutinin staining. The images were recorded using a PlanApo 60×/1.4 oil infinity corrected/0.17 (Olympus America Inc.). To determine the relative distribution of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane, avoiding bias during analysis, the image series were coded and then batch-processed using the MetaMorph program (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). The channel containing GLUT4 fluorescence was extracted. After an automatic selection of the perimeter of the cell, the outer rim was expanded to ∼500 nm (5 pixels) to define the plasma membrane region. The intensity of fluorescence in the plasma membrane region was measured at 4-10 levels for each cell. For each heart (n = eight per group), 8-10 cells were analyzed per condition. We also tested for cross-signal between the two stainings and for nonspecific binding of secondary antibodies and obtained no fluorescence in either case. Determination of Transferrin Exocytosis—Cells plated on 6-cm diameter Petri dishes were equilibrated in medium containing 20 μg/ml biotin-labeled transferrin (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then cooled to 4 °C for 10 min to arrest endosomal trafficking, and the medium containing biotin-labeled transferrin was replaced with fresh medium with or without resistin (5 μg/ml). The plates were incubated for an additional 85 min at 37 °C. Time 0 was taken as the point at which fresh medium with or without resistin was added to the cells. To measure transferrin exocytosis, 40-μl samples of culture medium were obtained at 5, 25, 45, 65, and 85 min. These samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences). At the end of the experiments, cells were scraped off in lysis buffer, and protein content was measured using the Micro BCA protein assay. Protein content per plate was used to normalize densitometric results for quantitative analysis of transferrin exocytosis. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences were analyzed by analysis of variance, and pairwise significant differences were determined using the Fisher protected least-significance difference test. Transferrin release was analyzed by the Kruskall-Wallis test for each treatment group. Comparison across treatment groups was performed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (Stat-View Version 5.0.1 software, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Murine Resistin Reduces Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake in Isolated Cardiomyocytes—To assess the effect of murine wild-type resistin on glucose transport in isolated cardiomyocytes, we compared basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cells incubated in the presence or absence of 20 μg/ml resistin. We observed a similar impairment by resistin of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (36.5 and 30.9%, respectively) (Fig. 1). Because resistin impaired basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake to similar extents, the -fold increase in insulin-stimulated uptake was similar in resistin-treated and untreated cells (4.7 versus 4.3, respectively). To determine the time course of the effect of murine wild-type resistin, we preincubated cells with resistin for various time periods ranging from 0 to 90 min prior to incubation with or without insulin for an additional 40 min. We observed that the effect of resistin on impairment of basal (Fig. 2A) and insulin-stimulated (Fig. 2B) glucose uptake was maximal after 45 min of preincubation. We also observed that 10 and 5 min of resistin preincubation were sufficient to impair basal (Fig. 2A) and insulin-stimulated (Fig. 2B) glucose uptake, respectively.Fig. 2Time course for the ability of resistin to impair basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated cardiomyocytes. Glucose uptake was measured in cardiomyocytes treated for 0-90 min with 20 μg/ml FLAG (no resistin) or resistin-FLAG expressed in pZac2.1 prior to a 40-min incubation with or without insulin. Data are expressed as a percentage relative to transport rates observed in cells incubated without resistin (100%). Data are from three to four independent experiments done in triplicate.

Similar to our observations with mouse resistin, human resistin inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, it did not change basal uptake (Fig. 3). Resistin Down-regulates Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake at Physiological Concentrations—The serum concentration of resistin in wild-type mice and rats has been found to be in the range of 0.05-0.1 μg/ml (2Rangwala S.M. Rich A.S. Rhoades B. Shapiro J.S. Obici S. Rossetti L. Lazar M.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1937-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 4Muse E.D. Obici S. Bhanot S. Monia B.P. McKay R.A. Rajala M.W. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We thus sought to determine whether resistin can impair insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at concentrations found in vivo. Indeed, resistin remained active at 0.02 μg/ml (Fig. 4). Oligomerization Is Required for the Biological Effect of Resistin on Glucose Uptake—To investigate whether or not dimerization (i.e. disulfide bond linkage of resistin trimers to generate hexamers) is required for the full activity of murine resistin, we compared glucose uptake in cells incubated with either no resistin or dimeric or monomeric (C26A) resistin. As shown in Fig. 5, monomeric resistin had no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake versus dimeric resistin. We further assessed whether monomeric resistin has an inhibitory effect on the ability of dimeric resistin to reduce glucose uptake by co-incubating the cells in the presence of both dimeric and monomeric resistins. As shown in Fig. 5, monomeric resistin had no inhibitory effect on the ability of dimeric resistin to reduce insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Intriguingly, the monomer appeared to augment the effect of the dimer to reduce insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (p = 0.05 versus dimeric resistin). Resistin Inhibits the Translocation of GLUT4 to the Sarcolemmal Membrane of Isolated Cardiomyocytes—To gain further insight into the mechanism(s) by which resistin impairs insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, we used two independent methods to determine whether murine resistin impairs GLUT4 translocation. Fig. 6 depicts the results of immunofluorescence analysis of resistin-treated cardiomyocytes. Exposure of cardiomyocytes to insulin resulted in a significant increase in sarcolemmal GLUT4 fluorescence (26% increase relative to the basal level; p < 0.0001). Interestingly, exposure of cardiomyocytes to resistin only resulted in a 13% increase in sarcolemmal GLUT4 fluorescence relative to untreated cells (p < 0.0001). Treatment of cells with insulin and resistin was not associated with any additional change in sarcolemmal GLUT4 fluorescence beyond the levels observed with resistin alone. Despite the modest increase in membrane fluorescence in resistin-treated cells, the degree of membrane fluorescence was significantly less than that observed with insulin alone (p < 0.001). Immunofluorescence is unable to discern between GLUT4 molecules that may be docked or associated with the sarcolemma, but not fused or activated. Thus, we also adapted the IRAP biotinylation assay to measure insertion of GLUT4 vesicles into sarcolemmal membranes by exposing cells to non-cellpermeable biotin and determining the abundance of biotinylated IRAP in cells treated with insulin or resistin. IRAP is an integral component of GLUT4 vesicles that translocates along with GLUT4 in insulin-responsive cells and is more amenable to biotinylation than GLUT4. We obtained a 1.4-fold increase in surface IRAP appearance in insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 7). However, in the resistin-treated cells, we did not detect any significant increase in insulin-stimulated IRAP (GLUT4) translocation. Taken together, these data indicate that resistin impairs insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation. Resistin alone did not increase surface"
https://openalex.org/W1969727059,"Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) is the major enzyme that oxidizes ethanol-derived acetaldehyde. A nearly inactive form of the enzyme, ALDH2*2, is found in about 40% of the East Asian population. This variant enzyme is defined by a glutamate to lysine substitution at residue 487 located within the oligomerization domain. ALDH2*2 has an increased Km for its coenzyme, NAD+, and a decreased kcat, which lead to low activity in vivo. Here we report the 2.1 Å crystal structure of ALDH2*2. The structure shows a large disordered region located at the dimer interface that includes much of the coenzyme binding cleft and a loop of residues that form the base of the active site. As a consequence of these structural changes, the variant enzyme exhibits rigid body rotations of its catalytic and coenzyme-binding domains relative to the oligomerization domain. These structural perturbations are the direct result of the inability of lysine 487 to form important stabilizing hydrogen bonds with arginines 264 and 475. Thus, the elevated Km for coenzyme exhibited by this variant probably reflects the energetic penalty for reestablishing this site for productive coenzyme binding, whereas the structural alterations near the active site are consistent with the lowered Vmax.

Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) 1The abbreviations used are: ALDH2, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase; ALDH2*2, semidominant polymorphism of ALDH2; MCAD, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; ACES, N-(2-Acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. is best known for its role in ethanol metabolism, oxidizing acetaldehyde to acetate (1Hurley T.D. Edenberg H.J. Li T.K. Licinio J. Wong M. Pharmacogenomics: The Search for Individualized Therapies. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2002: 417-441Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, an additional role for ALDH2 has been described as the initiator of nitroglycerin bioactivation (2Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). About 40% of the East Asian population carries a semidominant polymorphism of the ALDH2 gene, ALDH2*2 (3Seitz H.K. Matsuzaki S. Yokoyama A. Homann N. Vakevainen S. Wang X.D. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 137S-143SCrossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The associated glutamate to lysine substitution at position 487 causes the enzyme to be nearly inactive in vivo. The resulting phenotype is characterized by an aversive response to ethanol consumption, which may include facial flushing, nausea, and tachycardia, with more severe reactions observed in those individuals who are homozygous for the polymorphism (4Peng G.S. Wang M.F. Chen C.Y. Luu S.U. Chou H.C. Li T.K. Yin S.J. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 463-476PubMed Google Scholar). This adverse effect has been linked to a lower frequency of alcoholism among those both hetero- and homozygous for the variant enzyme. Even so, ALDH2*2 has been linked to alcoholic liver disease as well as orapharyngo-laryngeal and esophageal cancers in alcoholic patients (5Enomoto N. Takase S. Takada N. Takada A. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Yokoyama A. Muramatsu T. Omori T. Matsushita S. Yoshimizu H. Higuchi S. Yokoyama T. Maruyama K. Ishii H. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 1705-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of human ALDH2*2 have been determined using protein expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (7Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variant enzyme was found to be active, but it exhibits a 200-fold increased Km for NAD+ and a diminished kcat. The enzyme Km for NAD+ exceeds the available concentration in the cell by 15-fold, which, combined with the 10-fold lower kcat value, would lead to an approximately 100-fold lower activity in vivo (7Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of ALDH2 has been solved and described previously (8Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 9Ni L. Zhou J. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2784-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a tetramer of four identical subunits, each consisting of 500 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). This tetramer can be regarded as a dimer of dimers in that the interface between monomers that form a dimer is different and more extensive than the interface between the two dimers that form the tetramer. Each subunit is composed of three main domains: the catalytic domain, the coenzyme or NAD+-binding domain, and the oligomerization domain (8Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Glu487 is located within the oligomerization domain, which is important for both dimer and tetramer formation. In wild-type ALDH2, Glu487 forms hydrogen bonds with Arg264 of the same subunit and with Arg475 of the adjacent dimer partner. Consequently, the disruption of these interactions by the presence of Lys487 was projected to perturb the structure of both its own subunit as well as its dimer partner (8Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The interaction across the dimer interface has been thought to be responsible for the dominant effects of this mutation (8Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Subunits of ALDH2. a, wild-type subunit with its three major domains labeled.

Half-site reactivity for ALDH2 was first demonstrated in wild-type horse liver ALDH2 where there was a pre-steady-state burst of NADH formation equivalent to 2 mol of NADH per ALDH2 tetramer (10Weiner H. Hu J.H. Sanny C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3853-3855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type rat ALDH2 demonstrated the same pre-steady-state burst, and the rate-limiting step was determined to be the deacylation step (7Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, ALDH2*2 does not demonstrate the pre-steady-state burst of NADH formation, suggesting that for the variant enzyme, the rate-limiting step occurs before NADH formation, possibly involving thiohemiacetal formation (7Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on studies conducted with wild type-ALDH2*2 heterotetramers, the current model of half-site reactivity is one where only one subunit per dimer pair is active in wild-type ALDH2 (11Zhou J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12019-12024Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Whether activity alternates between active sites or remains fixed in a particular active site is not yet understood. These kinetics studies support a model of dominance where a variant subunit would inactivate its wild-type dimer partner but would have no effect on the subunits in the dimer pair across the tetramer interface. Numerous aldehyde dehydrogenase crystal structures have shown that the nicotinamide portion of NAD(P) is flexible and occupies two main conformations (9Ni L. Zhou J. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2784-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Hammen P.K.

Interact. 2001; 130-132: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These conformations are likely to play a functional role in catalysis where the extended conformation is primarily occupied by NAD+ and is conducive to hydride transfer, and the other, more contracted conformation is primarily occupied by NADH and is conducive to acyl-enzyme hydrolysis (12Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Magnesium is important for stabilizing these two conformations, thereby elucidating its documented role in elevating Vmax. To further study the variant ALDH2 enzyme, we have solved the apoenzyme crystal structure of ALDH2*2 to 2.1 Å resolution. This structure reveals that mutation of Glu487 to lysine leads to extreme disorder of the dimer interface, including the helix αG that comprises part of the NAD+-binding site. The β-strand containing the general base Glu268 has shifted away from the active site, and other main-chain and side-chain shifts lead to an altered coenzyme-binding site. Lysine 487 itself, however, is well ordered, although the residue no longer contributes to favorable intersubunit interactions. Materials—Dithiothreitol, DEAE-Sepharose, p-hydroxyacetophenone, guanidine HCl, and ethylene glycol were all purchased from Sigma. ACES, MgCl2, and propionaldehyde were purchased from Aldrich. Grade I NAD+ was from Roche Applied Science. The Bio-Gel P-6 DG and Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent were obtained from Bio-Rad. Polyethylene glycol 6000 was from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA), and the 24-well sitting drop trays were from Charles Supper Co., Inc. (Natick, MA). Protein Preparation and Crystallization—Human ALDH2 E487K cDNA was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells using a pT-7-7 expression system previously described (7Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zheng C.F. Wang T.T. Weiner H. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mutant enzyme was isolated by first employing DEAE-Sepharose chromatography as previously published (16Zheng C.F. Wang T.T. Weiner H. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Jeng J.J. Weiner H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with a slight modification of the protocol; the pH of the sodium pyrophosphate buffer was changed to 6.6. Fractions containing ALDH2 were pooled and further purified on a p-hydroxyacetophenone affinity column as described previously (18Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The eluate was dialyzed in 4 liters of 10 mm ACES buffer, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.6, for 4 h. Eluate was then transferred to fresh dialysis buffer for an additional 4 h. Protein was concentrated in an Amicon stirred cell and then stored at -20 °C in a 50% glycerol solution. Before each crystallization tray preparation, protein was removed from -20 °C, and buffer was exchanged on a P6 gel column into 10 mm ACES buffer, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.6. Protein was concentrated to 8 mg/ml in a YM30 Amicon Centricon spinning at 2,000 × g. Protein concentration was monitored by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Enzyme activity was assayed at 25 °C in 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate HCl, pH 9.5, containing 10 mm NAD+ and 200 μm propionaldehyde. NADH production was monitored at 340 nm with a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. For crystal growth, sitting drop trays were set up at 20 °C in a glove box under nitrogen while maintaining a gaseous oxygen concentration less than 2%. Crystals were grown using the sitting drop configuration for vapor diffusion in solutions containing 100 mm ACES, pH 6.2-6.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm guanidine HCl, 15-17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, and 4-6 mm dithiothreitol. The equilibrium drop volume was 3 μl. Trays were stored at 20 °C, and crystals were harvested at 3-4 weeks. Flash freezing of the crystals was accomplished using a rapid two-step procedure to introduce 22% ethylene glycol cryoprotectant. The crystals were immediately flash frozen at 110 K in a N2 cryostream. Data Collection, Processing, and Model Refinement—Data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL) on beamline SBC-CAT 19ID. The beamline was equipped with the APS-1 3 × 3 array CCD detector. The x-ray beam wavelength for data collection was 12.4 keV. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL2000 program suite (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Phases were solved using the molecular replacement method with the human ALDH2 coordinates as a starting model. Molecular replacement was executed using the program AMoRe as implemented in the CCP4 program package (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar, 21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The resulting models were refined using the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) suite (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). For the refinement of the initial apoenzyme model, rigid body refinement was followed by simulated annealing and minimization that were performed with NCS restraints applied at a weight of 100 kcal/mol·Å2 for the main-chain atoms and 10 kcal/mol·Å2 for the side-chain atoms. This was followed by individual restrained isotropic temperature factor refinement. Model rebuilding was performed using the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). To reduce model bias, composite annealed omit maps were calculated. Only energy minimization and temperature factor refinements were utilized in subsequent rounds with residues 246-264 and 466-476 excluded from NCS restraints during minimization. In the final round of refinement, the NCS restraint weights were reduced to 50 kcal/mol·Å2 for main-chain atoms with no NCS restraints imposed on the side-chain atoms. In this final round, residues 244-271, 424-425, and 463-478 were excluded from the main-chain NCS restraints. Rfree was evaluated using a randomly chosen 5% of the crystallographic data. Structure Analysis—Hinge axis determination for positional domain differences between ALDH2 and ALDH2*2 were analyzed using the program DynDom as implemented in the CCP4 package (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar, 24Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Tetramer, subunit, and domain alignments were performed using the program LSQKAB as implemented in the CCP4 package (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar, 25Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). Root mean square deviations were calculated for the Cα atoms of each alignment. Residues 244-271, 424-425, and 463-478 were omitted for all pairings. To determine the extent of domain reorientation relative to wild type, the cofactor-binding domain was established as the point of reference. This domain was aligned to apoenzyme wild type. The rotated ALDH2*2 subunit was then realigned to wild type using either the catalytic or oligomerization domain. The extent of domain rotation is thus expressed as the amount of rotation necessary to align the domain of interest relative to the common positions of the coenzyme-binding domains. The extent of secondary structural shifts was determined by aligning the cofactor-binding and catalytic domains together to wild-type enzyme. Therefore, these values are expressed as the amount of shift within the context of these domains and are determined independently of domain shifts. Residues were considered ordered and were included in the final coordinates if the electron density maps contoured at one S.D. of the map indicated their presence. ALDH2*2 crystallized in the triclinic space group with three tetramers in the asymmetric unit. The crystal diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution, and the structure was refined to Rfree = 23.8% and Rwork = 20.4%. Like wild-type ALDH2, ALDH2*2 is a tetramer of four identical subunits. Ordered solvent molecules included 2649 water molecules, 21 ethylene glycol molecules, 8 guanidines, and 12 sodium ions.

Open table in a new tab Interactions Surrounding Lys487—The majority of residue Lys487 is well ordered and clearly present in the electron density maps contoured at one S.D. (Fig. 3a). The loss of hydrogen bonds among residues 487, 475, and 264 is accompanied by changes in side-chain conformation of these residues (Fig. 4). No favorable interactions were observed between Lys487 and Arg475 in the dimer partner. Lys487 points away from the dimer interface and forms no new hydrogen bonds. Lys487 does make van der Waals contacts with the side chain of Tyr468 (when observed) in the neighboring subunit as well as with the peptide carbonyl oxygen of Pro158 and the main chain and side chain of Val159 within its own subunit. Arg475 can only be modeled in seven of the 12 subunits. In each of the seven instances, residue 475 occupies the same conformation as wild type with the Nϵ atom within hydrogen bonding distance of the main-chain carbonyl of 488 in the neighboring subunit. The five remaining subunits do not display interpretable electron density for Arg475. Although not identical, all observed conformations for Arg264 are rotated away from Lys487.Fig. 4A stereo diagram of side-chain and main-chain shifts from the dimer interface to the NAD+-binding cleft. NAD+-bound wild type (violet, subunit A; blue, subunit B) and apoenzyme ALDH2*2 (red) are aligned.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Disorder at the Interface—The most striking feature of the ALDH2*2 crystal structure is the disordered region surrounding Lys487 including residues 244-272 and 463-478 (Table II). Adjacent to 469 in the catalytic domain, residues 424 and 425 are also disordered. Residues 469-473 are disordered in all subunits of the asymmetric unit. In 11 of the 12 subunits within the asymmetric unit, residues 248-262 are not visible in electron density maps contoured at one S.D. (Fig. 3b). These residues comprise the αG helix located at the interface between adjacent subunits within a dimer pair. This helix also comprises part of the adenine binding pocket for NAD+. In subunit A, αG is more ordered with only residues 257-263 missing. Although this helix is observed, it has shifted 3 Å, relative to the wild-type structure (Fig. 2b). In the remaining subunits, the general path of αG appears to shift in the same manner as in subunit A; however, the residues are insufficiently defined in the electron density maps for confident placement.Table IIDisordered residuesSubunitαG helixLoopLoopA257-263424-425463-478B244-264424-425468-473C246-262424-425468-474D248-263424-425469-476E246-262424-425469-474F246-262424-425468-474G246-262424-425469-474H246-262424-425469-474I246-263424-425469-474J246-263424-425469-475K246-271424-425466-475L245-263424-425466-476 Open table in a new tab Unique to subunit A are the crystal packing contacts between this subunit and the crystallographically related subunit K. The αJ helix of subunit K makes contact with and stabilizes αF of subunit A. This results in a 15% lower average temperature factor for αF as compared with the rest of the subunit. αF is positioned on the opposite side of the NAD+-binding cleft from αG, and its increased order supports αG in this subunit. Adjacent to αG in both primary and tertiary structure is the β11 strand, which includes Arg264 and Glu268. In all subunits of ALDH2*2, the position of the β11 strand is shifted 2 Å in the same direction as αG. The Cα atom of the putative general base, Glu268, has shifted ∼1.5 Å away from the active site, and its side-chain position is ill defined and not consistent among the subunits. In response to the shifts of both αG and β11, β10 has shifted 0.8 Å in the same direction as αG and β11. Loop Disorder Linked to Active Site—In wild-type ALDH2, the loop composed of residues 463-478 interacts with residues 269-272 through two hydrogen bonds: one between the peptide carbonyl oxygen of 472 and the main-chain nitrogen of 269 and the other between the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser471 and the peptide carbonyl oxygen of residue 270 (Fig. 4). Residues 269-272 associate with the active site through a hydrogen bond between the peptide nitrogen of 271 and the side chain of Glu399. In cofactor-bound wild-type ALDH2, Glu399 stabilizes the nicotinamide portion of NAD+ by forming hydrogen bonds between its carboxylate and the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl oxygens of the nicotinamide ribose (hydride transfer conformation). However, in concert with the flexibility of the loop containing residues 463-478 in ALDH2*2, the main chain of residues 269-272 rotates such that the amino nitrogen of 271 no longer stabilizes the side chain of Glu399 in the active site (Fig. 4). Glu399 assumes a new conformation that is rotated away from the active site and is instead stabilized by the peptide nitrogen of 272. Coincident with this change, the side chain of Phe401 rotates into the void created by the movement of Glu399. Phe401 supports the binding of the NMN portion of the coenzyme in all ALDH2 holoenzyme structures. The Active Site—The catalytic nucleophile, cysteine 302, is well ordered and retains a wild-type-like conformation. Electron density maps surrounding Cys302 reveal binding of an unknown molecule. Kinetics experiments have shown that the crystallization precipitant, polyethylene glycol 6000MW, contains aldehydes at an approximate concentration of 0.5 mm (12Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D.

The resolution of the data is insufficient to fully define the bound molecule; therefore, solvent molecules were modeled into the positive difference peaks to partially account for the unknown molecule. Asparigine 169, important for stabilizing oxyanion formation in the transition state (8Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D.

As mentioned above, the side chain of Glu268 is disordered and not consistent among subunits. Domain Shifts—Between the cofactor-binding domain and the oligomerization domain lies a hinge axis about which there is a 2.5° rotation in ALDH2*2 relative to wild type, as determined using the program DynDom (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

Analysis of relative domain positions within the dimer pair revealed residues that form the hinge, which include the three β strands of the oligomerization domain as well as the loop composed of residues 463-478. Individual domain alignments using the tetramer, dimer, and monomer were also performed (Table III). These, too, demonstrate that the cofactor-binding and catalytic domains have changed position within the tetramer in a manner that can best be described as a 2.5° rigid body rotation away from the dimer interfaces (Fig. 5).Table IIIRoot mean square deviations of Cα atoms for alignments of ALDH2*2 to apoenzyme wild-type ALDH2 (Å2)DomainAll domainsOligomerizationCoenzyme/catalyticCoenzymeCatalyticWild-type tet1 to 2*2 tet10.750.410.770.780.71Wild-type ab to 2*2 ab0.740.390.760.670.68Wild-type a to 2*2 a0.300.340.220.190.222*2 a to 2*2 b0.170.150.140.130.10 Open table in a new tab The crystal structure studies of ALDH2*2 have revealed that mutation of glutamate to lysine at residue 487 causes a large structural transition within the variant enzyme. Whereas Lys487 is not itself disordered in the ALDH2*2 crystal structure, its presence at the dimer interface perturbs local secondary structure elements, particularly αG, β10, β11, and the loop consisting of residues 463-478. These structures are either closely or directly involved with NAD+ binding. The disruptions of αG and the aforementioned loop also lead to an unstable dimer interface where the catalytic and coenzyme-binding domains of individual subunits rotate away from the interface. Moreover, the general base, Glu268, is not stably positioned for catalysis, and the active site is further disrupted at residues 399 and 401 through a cascade of changes that appear to originate in the dimer partner. These shifted main-chain and side-chain positions undoubtedly contribute to the decreased activity observed for this ALDH2 variant and also shed light on the variant's mechanism of allelic dominance. Disorder of residues 463-478 has been observed in other aldehyde dehydrogenase crystal structures. Lamb and Newcomer have reported these residues missing in the electron density maps of cofactor-bound retinal dehydrogenase type II (RalDH2), which shares about 67% sequence identity with ALDH2 (26Lamb A.L.

Whereas CaM enhances inactivation of Ca2+ currents through Cav1.2 (L-type) Ca2+ channels, CaBP1 completely prevents this process. How CaBP1 and CaM mediate such opposing effects on Cav1.2 inactivation is unknown. Here, we identified molecular determinants in the α1-subunit of Cav1.2 (α11.2) that distinguish the effects of CaBP1 and CaM on inactivation. Although both proteins bind to a well characterized IQ-domain in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of α11.2, mutations of the IQ-domain that significantly weakened CaM and CaBP1 binding abolished the functional effects of CaM, but not CaBP1. Pulldown binding assays revealed Ca2+-independent binding of CaBP1 to the N-terminal domain (NT) of α11.2, which was in contrast to Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to this region. Deletion of the NT abolished the effects of CaBP1 in prolonging Cav1.2 Ca2+ currents, but spared Ca2+-dependent inactivation due to CaM. We conclude that the NT and IQ-domains of α11.2 mediate functionally distinct interactions with CaBP1 and CaM that promote conformational alterations that either stabilize or inhibit inactivation of Cav1.2.

Although nearly 50% identical to CaM at the amino acid level, CaBP1 has effects on voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that oppose those of CaM (11Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T.

In transfected cells, CaM is constitutively associated with Cav1.2 (L-type) Ca2+ channels and causes both negative (Ca2+-dependent inactivation, CDI) and positive (Ca2+-dependent facilitation) feedback regulation of these channels (14Peterson B.Z.

Given the importance of Cav1.2 in regulating cardiac and neuronal Ca2+ signaling, elucidating the mechanisms distinguishing CaM and CaBP1 modulation of Cav1.2 is critical for understanding how these channels function in different cellular contexts. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that unique molecular determinants in α11.2 underlie divergent regulation of Cav1.2 by CaBP1 and CaM. We found that the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of α11.2 is essential for Cav1.2 modulation by CaBP1 but not by CaM, although the IQ-domain is important for Ca2+-dependent association of CaBP1 with the channel. Our results reveal molecular insights into how CaBP1, CaM, and related CaBPs differentially regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and potentially other targets. Constructs and Molecular Biology—The rbcII variant of the rat brain α11.2 (GenBank™ M67515) was used in this study. The following constructs were described previously (17Zhou H. Kim S.A. Kirk E.A. Tippens A.L. Sun H. Haeseleer F. Lee A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar): FLAG-α11.2 and FLAG-α11.2IQ-EE; human CaBP1-S (GenBank™ NM 004276) and CaBP1-L (GenBank™ NM 031205) cloned into pcDNA3.1+ or pEGFPN-1; CT6 (IQ), CT6IQ-EE (IQ-EE), and CT6IQ-AA (IQ-AA) cloned into pGEX4T1. FLAG-α11.2ΔNT and FLAG-α11.2ΔNT-IQ-EE were generated by PCR amplification of a FLAG-tagged fragment lacking the N-terminal 64 amino acids of rat α11.2 and cloning into HindIII sites of FLAG-α11.2 or FLAG-α11.2IQ-EE, respectively. For plate binding assays, CaBP1-L was subcloned into NdeI/BamHI sites of pET30b. For pulldown assays, the GST constructs containing cytoplasmic domains of rat α11.2 were subcloned into BamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX4T1: NT (amino acids 1-124); loop I-II (amino acids 406-524); loop II-III (amino acids 754-902); loop III-IV (amino acids 1170-1222). The identity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to use in experiments. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere under 7% CO2. Cells were grown to ∼70-80% confluence and transfected with Gene Porter reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Plate Binding Assays—GST-IQ, His-CaBP1, and His-CaM fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 E. coli and purified as described previously (17Zhou H. Kim S.A. Kirk E.A. Tippens A.L. Sun H. Haeseleer F. Lee A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Concentrations of recombinant proteins were determined by a commercial kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Five pmol His-CaBP1 or His-CaM was adsorbed to each well of a 96-well plate by incubating overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing wells with TBST (Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl) + 0.1% Triton X-100), wells were blocked with 3% milk/TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were then incubated with varying concentrations of GST-IQ fusion proteins or GST as a negative control (100 μl in TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times with 200 μl of TBST, wells were processed with monoclonal anti-GST (1:500 in TBST; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times in TBST, wells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 in TBST; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with TBST and colorimetric reaction product generated with addition of TMB substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 450 nm from a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Specific binding was determined by subtracting absorbance values for wells containing GST from those containing GST-IQ. Pulldown Binding Assays—CaBP1 used for binding assays was obtained by transfecting 293T cells plated on 150-mm dishes with a total of 5 μg of cDNA encoding CaBP1/pcDNA3.1+. Two days later, cells were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and membrane proteins solubilized by rotating at 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used immediately or aliquotted and stored at -80 °C. GST-tagged proteins corresponding to cytoplasmic domains of α11.2 were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (17Zhou H. Kim S.A. Kirk E.A. Tippens A.L. Sun H. Haeseleer F. Lee A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Purified CaM (5 μg; Sigma-Aldrich) or lysates of cells transfected with CaBP1 were added to 50 μl of a 50% slurry of immobilized fusion protein and brought to a total volume of 1 ml with binding buffer (TBST with protease inhibitors) containing either 2 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA. Binding reactions were incubated at 4 °C, rotating, for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and bound proteins eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Bound CaBP1 or CaM was detected by Western blot with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CaBP1 (1:2000; UW72) (6Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Verlinde C.L.M.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pronin A.N.

Blots were processed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG 1:4000, anti-mouse IgG 1:2000) and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—293T cells were transfected with equimolar amounts of cDNAs encoding Cav1.2 subunits (FLAG-α11.2, β2A, and α2δ) with or without CaBP1. At least 48 h later, cell lysates were prepared as described above and incubated with 40 μl of anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, rotating at 4 °C. After five washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer, proteins were eluted with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Coimmunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-CaBP1 (UW72) or monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (M2, 1:2000; Sigma) followed by secondary antibodies and ECL detection as described above.

At least 48 h after transfection, whole-cell patch clamp recordings of transfected cells were acquired with a HEKA EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Germany). Data acquisition and leak subtraction using a P/-4 protocol were done with Pulse software (HEKA). Extracellular recording solutions contained 150 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm CaCl2 or BaCl2. Intracellular solutions consisted of 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Mg-ATP, and 5 mm EGTA. The pH of intracellular and extracellular recording solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. Electrode resistances were typically 1-2 MΩ in the bath solution and series resistance was ∼2-4 MΩ, compensated up to 70%. In recordings of Ba2+ currents, voltage protocols were adjusted by -10 mV to compensate for the corresponding shift in voltage dependence of activation with substitution of extracellular Ba2+ for Ca2+. Current-voltage curves were fit by: I = g(V-E)/{1+exp[(V-V1/2)/k]}, where g = maximum conductance, V = test voltage, E = apparent reversal potential, V1/2 = voltage of half-maximal activation, and k = slope factor. Data were analyzed using Igor software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), and graphs and statistical analysis were done with Sigma Plot (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Role of the IQ-domain in CaBP1 Regulation of Cav1.2— CaBP1 binds to the IQ-domain of α1 1.2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and competitively inhibits CaM binding to this region (17Zhou H. Kim S.A.

We further characterized the effects of these IQ mutations on inactivation during sustained depolarizations (Fig. 1). To directly compare modulation by CaM and CaBP1 in these experiments, we restricted analysis to Ca2+ currents (ICa), as Ba2+ currents (IBa) show no CaM-dependent enhancement of inactivation (14Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 15Zühlke R.G. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H.

Inactivation was expressed as Ires/Ipk, which is the residual ICa amplitude at the end of a 1-s test pulse normalized to the peak current amplitude (Fig. 1). In 293T cells transfected with Cav1.2 alone, ICa decays almost completely during the 1-s pulse, due to CDI mediated by endogenous CaM in these cells (Fig. 1B). CaBP1, which is not expressed in 293T cells (17Zhou H. Kim S.A. Kirk E.A. Tippens A.L. Sun H. Haeseleer F. Lee A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), overrides the effects of CaM and inhibits inactivation of ICa, resulting in a significant increase in Ires/Ipk, compared with Cav1.2 alone (∼197%, p <0.01). IQ mutations did not prevent the effects of CaBP1 in that Ires/Ipk was still significantly increased in cells cotransfected with Cav1.2IQ-AA (∼234%, p <0.01, compared with Cav1.2IQ-AA alone) and Cav1.2IQ-EE (∼153%, p <0.02, compared with Cav1.2IQ-EE alone). Residual effects of CaBP1 in cells transfected with Cav1.2IQ-AA and Cav1.2IQ-EE could have resulted from the failure of IQ mutations to weaken interactions with CaBP1. We tested this quantitatively in plate binding assays with recombinant CaBP1 and GST fusion proteins containing amino acids 1616-1717 of α11.2 (Fig. 2A, GST-IQ). Effects of IQ substitutions were determined by normalizing to the maximal binding of CaBP1 to the wild-type GST-IQ. In these experiments, AA and EE substitutions significantly reduced binding of CaBP1 compared with the wild-type GST-IQ protein (∼75% for IQ-AA and >90% for IQ-EE at [GST-IQ] = 8 × 10-5 m; Fig. 2B). In the same assay, IQ-AA and IQ-EE substitutions also inhibited CaM binding (∼70% for IQ-AA and 88% for IQ-EE at [GST-IQ] = 8 × 10-5 m; Fig. 2C). These results were confirmed in pulldown assays, where CaBP1 and CaM binding to GST-IQ was decreased by IQ-AA and eliminated by IQ-EE substitution (Fig. 2, B and C). In previous studies, IQ-EE, but not IQ-AA, mutations altered the apparent affinity of Ca2+-dependent CaM binding (22Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol.

The ability of IQ-AA to more significantly inhibit CaM binding in our experiments could have resulted from the use of a larger GST-tagged fusion protein (∼100 amino acids) applied in plate binding and pulldown assays rather than a short (∼20 amino acids) peptide used in gel-shift or fluorescence-based assays in previous studies (22Zühlke R.D.

CaBP1 Binding to Additional Sites in α11.2—That IQ mutations could disrupt binding but not the functional effects of CaBP1 indicated that the IQ-domain is not the primary determinant for CaBP1 effects on Cav1.2 inactivation. We therefore searched for other CaBP1-binding sites in α11.2 that could account for the residual effects of CaBP1 on Cav1.2IQ-AA and Cav1.2IQ-EE. GST fusion proteins corresponding to each of the cytoplasmic domains of α11.2 were used in pulldown assays with CaBP1 or CaM (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition to the IQ-domain, CaM has been shown to interact with both the N-terminal domain (NT) and the cytoplasmic loop connecting domains I and II (LI-II) of α11.2 (21Pitt G.S. Zühlke R.D.

Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39846-39854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and our experiments confirmed these findings (Fig. 3B). In contrast, CaBP1 did not bind LI-II but bound specifically to the NT as well as the loop connecting domains III and IV (LIII-IV) (Fig. 3B). Although deletion of CaM binding sequences in LI-II did not influence CDI (21Pitt G.S. Zühlke R.D. Hudmon A. Schulman H. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30794-30802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), Ivanina et al. (25Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Barzilai R. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39846-39854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) showed that deletion of portions of the NT diminished CDI. Therefore, we hypothesized that the NT was a potentially important site through which CaBP1 might oppose the action of CaM. We further compared binding of CaBP1 and CaM to the NT and found that whereas CaM required Ca2+ for the interaction, CaBP1 binding to the NT was mostly Ca2+ independent, although binding was greater in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). These results raised the possibility Cav1.2 modulation by CaBP1 may depend on its constitutive association with the NT rather than Ca2+-dependent interactions with the IQ-domain. Effects of Deleting α11.2 NT on CaBP1 and CaM Modulation—To address the functional significance of the NT with respect to modulation by CaBP1, we analyzed ICa inactivation in cells cotransfected with CaBP1 and Cav1.2 channels lacking the first 64 amino acids of α11.2 (Cav1.2ΔNT). Because such a significant deletion could affect channel gating that could secondarily influence interactions with CaBP1, we first compared the current-voltage relationships of Cav1.2 and Cav1.2ΔNT transfected alone or with CaBP1. As shown in Fig. 4, NT deletion did not significantly affect voltage-dependent activation of Cav1.2 currents either in the presence or absence of CaBP1. However, NT deletion negated the effect of CaBP1 on ICa inactivation (Fig. 5). In contrast to the limited inactivation of ICa evoked by sustained or repetitive depolarizations in cells cotransfected with CaBP1 and Cav1.2 (Fig. 5, A and C), CaBP1 had no effect on ICa inactivation in cells cotransfected with Cav1.2ΔNT with either voltage protocol (Fig. 5, B and D). There was no significant difference in Ires/Ipk over a range of test voltages in cells transfected with Cav1.2ΔNT alone and those cotransfected with CaBP1 (Fig. 5B), eliminating the possibility that deletion of the NT simply altered the voltage dependence of CaBP1 modulation.Fig. 5Deletion of NT prevents effects of CaBP1 on Cav1.2 inactivation. A and B, Ires/Ipk was determined as in Fig. 1 for ICa evoked by varying voltages and plotted against test voltage. Representative current traces are shown above. Vertical scale bars represent 0.5 nA in panel A and 0.4 nA in panel B. C and D, ICa or IBa was evoked by 5-ms depolarizations to +10 mV from -80 mV at a frequency of 100 Hz. Fractional current represents peak test current amplitude normalized to that for the first pulse in the train and is plotted against time. For clarity, every third point is shown. Results were obtained for IBa (▵) or ICa (•,○) from cells cotransfected with Cav1.2 (A, C) or Cav1.2ΔNT (B, D) alone (○) or cotransfected with CaBP1 (•). Points represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although Cav1.2ΔNT was completely insensitive to the effects of CaBP1, CDI was still evident in these channels in that inactivation of IBa was significantly less than that for ICa in cells transfected with Cav1.2ΔNT (Fig. 5D). The sparing of CaM-, but not CaBP1-dependent modulation of Cav1.2ΔNT, indicated a difference in the relative importance of the NT for the functional effects of CaM and CaBP1. To test this, we compared how alterations of the NT and/or IQ-domain of α11.2 influenced CaM and CaBP1 effects on inactivation during 1-s depolarizations (Fig. 6). Comparisons of Ires/Ipk with ICa and IBa in cells transfected with mutant or wild-type Cav1.2 alone were used to gauge modulation by CaM (CDI), whereas CaBP1 effects were indicated by the difference between Ires/Ipk for ICa in cells transfected with wild-type or mutant channel alone and those cotransfected with CaBP1. CDI was evident as a significant increase in Ires/Ipk for IBa compared with ICa in cells transfected with Cav1.2 (∼113%, p <0.01, Fig. 6, A and B). NT deletion largely spared CDI (Ires/Ipk = 0.45 ± 0.02, n = 10, for ICa versus 0.66 ± 0.04, n = 6, for IBa, p <0.01), whereas CDI was abolished with Cav1.2IQ-EE (Ires/Ipk = 0.37 ± 0.03, n = 4, for ICa versus 0.46 ± 0.03, n = 6, for IBa, p = 0.10) and Cav1.2ΔNT-IQ-EE (Ires/Ipk = 0.55 ± 0.03, n = 11, for ICa versus 0.59 ± 0.04, n = 5, for IBa, p = 0.15). In comparison to these results for CDI, deletion of the NT had a much larger impact on modulation by CaBP1. There was no effect of CaBP1 on ICa inactivation in cells cotransfected with Cav1.2ΔNT (Ires/Ipk = 0.45 ± 0.02, n = 10, for Cav1.2ΔNT alone versus 0.44 ± 0.02, n = 19, for Cav1.2ΔNT +CaBP1, p = 0.85, Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, deletion of the NT from channels harboring IQ-EE mutations largely prevented the residual effects of CaBP1 seen in the single mutant Cav1.2IQ-EE channels (Ires/Ipk = 0.55 ± 0.03, n = 11, for Cav1.2ΔNT-IQ-EE alone versus 0.63 ± 0.04, n = 10, for Cav1.2ΔNT-IQ-EE +CaBP1, p = 0.15, Fig. 6, A and B). These results clearly showed that the NT is essential for the regulation of ICa inactivation by CaBP1, but not by CaM. The residual modulation by CaBP1 of Cav1.2IQ-EE, but not Cav1.2ΔNT-IQ-EE, suggested that CaBP1 interactions with the NT actively suppressed inactivation of ICa, leading to an apparent loss of CDI. If so, then CaBP1 should not block CDI in Cav1.2ΔNT channels. We tested this prediction by comparing inactivation of ICa and IBa in cells cotransfected with CaBP1 and Cav1.2 or Cav1.2ΔNT. As we have shown previously (17Zhou H. Kim S.A. Kirk E.A. Tippens A.L. Sun H. Haeseleer F. Lee A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), CaBP1 prevented CDI of Cav1.2 and even caused slower inactivation of ICa compared with IBa (Fig. 6C). However, in cells cotransfected with CaBP1 and Cav1.2ΔNT, CDI was quite robust (∼86% increase in Ires/Ipk for IBa compared with ICa, p <0.01, Fig. 6C). These results confirmed that blockade of CDI is secondary to the effects of CaBP1 on slowing ICa inactivation and that the NT is required for this process. Significance of the IQ-domain for Physical Association of CaBP1 with Cav1.2 Channels—Given that CaBP1 binds to the NT and IQ-domain of α11.2, yet only deletion of the NT abolished CaBP1 modulation of Cav1.2, we investigated how these two sites contributed to the physical association of CaBP1 with the intact channel. Our pulldown assays suggested that the NT could be a tethering site for CaBP1 while the IQ-domai"

Previously, IscA was characterized as an alternative iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold, as purified IscA can host transient iron-sulfur clusters. However, recent studies indicated that IscA is an iron-binding protein that can provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in a proposed scaffold IscU (Ding H., Clark, R. J., and Ding, B.

To further elucidate the roles of IscA in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, we reevaluate the iron binding activity of IscA under physiologically relevant conditions. The results indicate that in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system, Escherichia coli IscA binds iron with an iron association constant of 2.0 × 1019 m-1 in vitro. Whereas all three components (thioredoxin 1, thioredoxin reductase and NADPH) in the thioredoxin reductase system are essential for mediating the iron binding in IscA, only catalytic amounts of thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin reductase are required. In contrast, IscU fails to bind iron in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system, suggesting that the iron binding in IscA is specific. Nevertheless, the thioredoxin reductase system can promote the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in the presence of the iron-loaded IscA, cysteine desulfurase (IscS), and l-cysteine, demonstrating a physiologically relevant system for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The results provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that IscA is capable of recruiting intracellular “free” iron and delivering the iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU.

The x-ray crystallographic studies revealed that IscA may exist as a tetramer with a central channel formed by the association of the monomers (24Bilder P.W. Ding H. Newcomer M.E.

Within the channel, the three invariant cysteine residues (Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101) from each IscA monomer are projected to form a “cysteine pocket,” which could accommodate the binding of mononuclear iron centers in the protein (22Ding H.

Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem.

While IscA binds iron with a remarkable iron association constant in the presence of dithiothreitol, IscU fails to do so under the same experimental conditions (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the iron-loaded IscA can efficiently provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU when l-cysteine, IscS, and dithiothreitol are present in the incubation solution (21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem.

Collectively, we postulated that IscA may act as an iron chaperon that delivers iron for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in IscU. The pitfall of the previous biochemical characterizations of IscA (21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was that the experiments were carried out in the presence of dithiothreitol, a synthetic thiol-reducing reagent. It could be questioned whether the observed iron binding in IscA was an artifact of dithiothreitol and therefore physiologically irrelevant. To further explore the roles of IscA in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, we reevaluated the iron binding activity of IscA under physiologically relevant conditions and found that the E. coli thioredoxin reductase system can mediate the iron binding in IscA and promote the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU. The role of the thioredoxin reductase system in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters will be discussed. Protein Purification—Recombinant E. coli IscA (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem.

The purity of purified proteins was greater than 95% as judged by electrophoresis analysis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS followed by staining with Coomassie Blue.

Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly in IscU—For a typical iron-sulfur cluster assembly reaction, IscU (100 μm) was incubated with the iron-loaded IscA (150 μm), IscS (2 μm), TrxA (10 μm), TrxB (1 μm), and NADPH (500 μm) in buffer containing NaCl (200 mm) and Tris (20 mm) (pH 8.0). The reaction mixture was purged with pure argon gas and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before l-cysteine (1 mm) was added to initiate the iron-sulfur cluster assembly reaction. The iron-sulfur cluster assembly was monitored in a Beckman DU640 UV-visible absorption spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller. After a 30-min incubation anaerobically at 37 °C, the samples were loaded onto a Mono-Q column pre-equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-1 m) within 10 column volumes at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The absorption spectrum of each fraction eluted from the column was immediately recorded. The amounts of the iron-sulfur clusters assembled in IscU were calculated from the amplitudes of the absorption peak at 456 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5.8 mm-1 cm-1 (5Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The eluted fractions were then subjected to the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The Thioredoxin Reductase System Mediates the Iron Binding in IscA—In previous studies, we reported that purified E. coli IscA has a dominant absorption peak at 315 nm with a shoulder at 430 nm, an indicator of the iron binding in the protein (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The absorption peak at 315 nm and the shoulder at 430 nm of IscA were removed after incubation with l-cysteine (23Ding B. Smith E.S. Ding H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and fully restored after reincubation with ferrous iron in the presence of dithiothreitol, a synthetic thiol-reducing reagent (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Without dithiothreitol, however, iron binding in apo-IscA (IscA devoid of iron) was negligible. Thus, the observed iron binding in IscA could be an artifact of dithiothreitol and physiologically irrelevant. The physiological counterpart of dithiothreitol is a group of small proteins called the thioredoxin superfamily that provides a thiol-reducing environment in cells (32Aslund F. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We chose to reevaluate the iron binding activity of IscA in the presence of thioredoxin 1 (TrxA), because TrxA represents the most abundant thiol-reducing activity in E. coli cells (32Aslund F. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the thioredoxin reductase system, TrxA is reduced by the FAD-bound thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) using NADPH as reductant (31Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For the experiments, E. coli TrxA and TrxB were produced from respective expression vectors and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The enzyme activity of TrxB was examined by monitoring the oxidation of NADPH in the presence of different concentrations of TrxA. The specific enzyme activity of TrxB was found to be comparable with that reported by Mulrooney (31Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When apo-IscA was incubated with an equivalent amount of ferrous iron anaerobically at 37 °C for 30 min, there was little iron binding in IscA (Fig. 1A, spectrum b). However, when apo-IscA was incubated with an equivalent amount of ferrous iron in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system anaerobically at 37 °C for 30 min, apo-IscA was converted to the iron-loaded IscA, which has a typical absorption peak at 315 nm with a shoulder at 430 nm (Fig. 1A, spectrum a). Judging from the ratio of the absorption amplitude at 315 nm to that at 260 nm (∼1.06) (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), nearly all apo-IscA was transformed to the iron-loaded IscA after incubation. In the control experiments where one of the three components of the thioredoxin reductase system (TrxA, TrxB, and NADPH) was omitted in the incubation solution, essentially no iron binding in IscA was found after incubation (Fig. 1B), indicating that all three components in the thioredoxin reductase system are necessary for mediating the iron binding in IscA. The iron binding activity of IscA was further examined by titrating TrxA and NADPH in the presence of a catalytic amount of TrxB (1 μm). As shown in Fig. 2A, ∼2 μm TrxA was sufficient to mediate the iron binding in 100 μm IscA, suggesting that TrxA, like TrxB, has a catalytic role in mediating the iron binding in IscA. On the other hand, ∼500 μm NADPH was required for 100 μm apo-IscA to fully bind iron in the presence of TrxA and TrxB (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that the thioredoxin reductase system facilitates the iron binding in IscA likely through reducing the specific cysteine residues in IscA. The Iron Binding Affinity of IscA in the Presence of the Thioredoxin Reductase System—We then analyzed the iron binding affinity of IscA in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system. Fig. 3A shows the iron binding curve of apo-IscA. As the iron concentration in the incubation solution was increased, the absorption peak at 315 nm of IscA was proportionally increased and apparently saturated when the iron concentration was about half of the monomeric IscA concentration. Analysis of the iron content in the iron-saturated IscA samples showed that the ratio of iron to IscA monomer was ∼0.45:1.0, consistent with the previous report for the iron binding of IscA in the presence of dithiothreitol (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The sulfur content in the IscA samples was also analyzed following the procedure described by Beinert (33Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The amounts of sulfur in the iron-saturated IscA, apo-IscA, and the as-isolated IscA were all negligible (data not shown), which is consistent with the results reported previously (21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23Ding B. Smith E.S. Ding H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the control experiments where TrxB was not included in the incubation solution, no iron binding in IscA was found after incubation with increasing concentrations of ferrous iron (Fig. 3A). Similarly, without TrxA or NADPH, IscA failed to bind iron in the solutions even with increasing concentrations of ferrous iron (data not shown). The iron binding activity in IscA was further investigated by using an iron competitor, citrate, in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system. Citrate is a physiological iron chelator with an apparent iron association constant of 1.0 × 1017 m-1 (34Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this experiment, apo-IscA (100 μm) was incubated with various concentrations of citrate (0-100 mm) in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system anaerobically at 37 °C for 10 min followed by addition of ferrous iron (50 μm). After additional incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the iron binding in IscA was analyzed from its absorption peak at 315 nm. As shown in Fig. 3B, ∼5 mm citrate was required to compete off half of the iron binding in 100 μm IscA. Using the iron association constant of 1.0 × 1017 m-1 for citrate (34Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we estimated that the iron association constant of IscA in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system is ∼2.0 × 1019 m-1. The Iron Binding Specificity of IscA in the Presence of the Thioredoxin Reductase System—IscA has three invariant cysteine residues (Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101) that are critical for the protein function in vitro (21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and in vivo (35Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Kaut A. Lange H. Diekert K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15955-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Like IscA, the proposed scaffold IscU also has three invariant cysteine residues (Cys-37, Cys-63, and Cys-106) (5Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 27Bertini I. Cowan J.A. Del Bianco C. Luchinat C. Mansy S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 907-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Ramelot T.A. Cort J.R. Goldsmith-Fischman S. Kornhaber G.J. Xiao R. Shastry R. Acton T.B. Honig B. Montelione G.T. Kennedy M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to examine whether IscU can also bind iron in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system. When E. coli IscU was incubated with an equivalent amount of ferrous iron in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system anaerobically at 37 °C for 30 min, the absorption spectrum of IscU was not changed before and after incubation (Fig. 4B). The iron analyses further showed that the iron content in IscU before and after incubation was not detectable, indicating that IscU, unlike IscA (Fig. 4A), has a fairly weak iron binding activity in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system. To further determine whether the iron binding in IscA is specific, we used an IscA mutant in which the Cys-101 was replaced with serine (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When the IscA mutant (C101S) was incubated with an equivalent amount of ferrous iron in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system, no iron binding in the IscA mutant was found (Fig. 4C). The same results were obtained with the IscA mutant in which the Cys-99 was replaced with serine (data not shown). Thus, the observed iron binding in IscA in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system is highly specific. A Complete System for the Biogenesis of Iron-Sulfur Clusters—We have shown previously that the iron center in the iron-loaded IscA can be mobilized by l-cysteine (23Ding B. Smith E.S. Ding H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and transferred for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in the presence of dithiothreitol (21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here, we attempted to explore a complete physiologically relevant system for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. For the experiments, the iron-loaded IscA was prepared by incubating apo-IscA with an equivalent amount of ferrous iron in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system followed by repurification of IscA. The cysteine desulfurase IscS, IscU, TrxA, and TrxB were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” without further manipulations. When IscU was incubated with the iron-loaded IscA, IscS, and l-cysteine anaerobically at 37 °C, a small but observable absorption peak at 456 nm, indicative of the iron-sulfur clusters assembly in IscU (5Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), gradually appeared (Fig. 5A). No absorption peak at 456 nm was observed without IscU in the incubation solution (data not shown), consistent with the previous reports that the absorption peak at 456 nm reflects the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in IscU (5Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When IscU was incubated with the iron-loaded IscA, IscS, and l-cysteine in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system, a much higher absorption peak at 456 nm was observed (Fig. 5B). If any one of the components in the incubation solution (the iron-loaded IscA, IscS, TrxA, TrxB, NADPH, or l-cysteine) was omitted, only very little or no iron-sulfur clusters were assembled in IscU (data not shown), suggesting that all six components are necessary for the efficient biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in IscU. To further examine whether iron-sulfur clusters were assembled in IscA or IscU, we repurified both proteins from the incubation solutions using a Mono-Q column under anaerobic conditions. IscA and IscU were mainly eluted in fractions 8 and 10, respectively (Fig. 6, C and D). Because only catalytic amounts of TrxA and TrxB were used in the incubation solutions, TrxA and TrxB in the eluted samples were not visible on the SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. When IscU was incubated with the iron-loaded IscA, l-cysteine, and IscS anaerobically, there was no indication of iron-sulfur clusters assembled in IscA (Fig. 6A, fraction 8), and only a small amount of iron-sulfur clusters assembled in IscU (Fig. 6A, fraction 10). Using an extinction coefficient of 5.8 mm-1 cm-1 at 456 nm (5Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we estimated that ∼10% of IscU was converted to the iron-sulfur cluster-bound IscU after incubation. When IscU was incubated with the iron-loaded IscA, l-cysteine, and IscS in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system anaerobically, there was again no indication of iron-sulfur clusters assembled in IscA (Fig. 6B, fraction 8). On the other hand, a significant absorption peak at 456 nm of IscU was observed (Fig. 6B, fraction 10). Using an extinction coefficient of 5.8 mm-1 cm-1 at 456 nm (5Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we estimated that ∼50% of IscU was converted to the iron-sulfur cluster-bound IscU. These results suggest that the thioredoxin reductase system can promote the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in the presence of the iron-loaded IscA, IscS, and l-cysteine, demonstrating a physiologically relevant system for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. In the early studies, “free” ferrous iron, “free” sulfide, and a thiol-reducing reagent dithiothreitol were often used for spontaneous reconstitution of iron-sulfur clusters in proteins in vitro (37Beinert H. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). It is now clear that the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters is not spontaneous (38Beinert H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5657-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The discovery of the cysteine desulfurase activity (NifS) for the biogenesis of nitrogenase (39Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 40Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided the first clue on how cells may utilize l-cysteine to provide sulfur for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly. However, the question as how the intracellular “free” iron may be mobilized and transferred for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly still remains elusive. The intracellular “free” iron concentration is tightly controlled, because the elevated levels of the “free” iron content promote the production of deleterious hydroxyl free radicals via the Fenton Reaction (41Keyer K. Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It was thus postulated that specific proteins must be involved in safeguarding and delivering iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Recently, frataxin, a mitochondrial protein linked to the human Fried-reich ataxia (42Puccio H. Koenig M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), has been proposed to be a candidate for delivering iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly (43Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 44Ramazzotti A. Vanmansart V. Foury F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, frataxin homologues are not essential for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in E. coli (45Li D.S. Ohshima K. Jiralerspong S. Bojanowski M.W. Pandolfo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (46Duby G. Foury F. Ramazzotti A. Herrmann J. Lutz T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and frataxin appears to be capable of delivering iron for the heme biogenesis in mitochondria (47Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 48Zhang Y. Lyver E.R. Knight S.A. Lesuisse E. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19794-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Evidently, additional proteins could be involved in delivering iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in cells. The results presented in this and previous studies (21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37499-37504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23Ding B. Smith E.S. Ding H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggested that E. coli IscA, the product of the third gene of the gene cluster iscSUA-hscBA-fdx (1Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 2Takahashi Y. Nakamura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), may fulfill the role of recruiting intracellular “free” iron and delivering the iron for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. IscA is highly conserved from bacteria to humans (49Cozar-Castellano I. Del Valle Machargo M. Trujillo E. Arteaga M.F. Gonzalez T. Martin-Vasallo P. Avila J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1700: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with three invariant cysteine residues (Cys-35, Cys-99, and Cys-101, E. coli numbering). In the x-ray crystal structure models (24Bilder P.W. Ding H. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the invariant cysteine residues are projected to form a “cysteine pocket,” which could accommodate the binding of mononuclear iron centers in the protein (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The site-directed mutagenesis studies further showed that the invariant cysteine residues are likely involved in the iron binding, as substitution of Cys-99 or Cys-101 with serine completely abolishes the iron binding activity of IscA (22Ding H. Clark R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). More importantly, the iron-loaded IscA can provide iron for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU in the presence of cysteine desulfurase IscS, l-cysteine, and the thioredoxin reductase system (Figs. 5 and 6). All these results support a notion that IscA is capable of recruiting intracellular “free” iron and delivering the iron for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The remarkable iron binding activity of IscA in the presence of the thioredoxin reductase system (Fig. 3) and the ease to mobilize the iron center in IscA by l-cysteine (23Ding B. Smith E.S. Ding H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggest an intriguing mechanism of the iron delivery for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. In cells in which reduced thioredoxins are abundant (32Aslund F. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IscA is expected to recruit intracellular “free” iron with an iron association constant of 2.0 × 1019 m-1 (Fig. 3). When there is a demand for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, the iron center in IscA may be mobilized by l-cysteine for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly (23Ding B. Smith E.S. Ding H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is worthy mentioning that l-cysteine is specific in mobilizing the iron center in IscA as other l-cysteine-related small molecular thiols such as glutathione and N-acetyl-l-cysteine have no effect on the iron center of IscA (23Ding B. Smith E.S. Ding H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because l-cysteine is also the substrate of cysteine desulfurases that provide sulfur for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly (7Smith A.D. Agar J.N. Johnson K.A. Frazzon J. Amster I.J. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11103-11104Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 8Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 9Kato S. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the intracellular l-cysteine content could be a major factor in determining the mobilization of the iron center in IscA and the overall biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. Evidently, the ultimate iron source for the iron-sulfur cluster assembly could be the iron storage proteins such as ferritin and bacterioferritin. The possible iron exchange between IscA and the iron storage proteins remains to be further investigated. The observed roles of the thioredoxin reductase system in mediating the iron binding in IscA and in promoting the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU suggest a potential interplay between the metabolism of small molecular thiol proteins and the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. In E. coli, there are two thioredoxins (thioredoxin 1 (TrxA) and thioredoxin 2 (TrxC)) and at least three glutaredoxins (glutaredoxin 1, glutaredoxin 2, and glutaredoxin 3) in the cytoplasm (32Aslund F. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these thioredoxin homologues have the Cys-X1-X2-Cys active site and a unique thioredoxin fold and are involved in diverse physiological functions such as ribonucleotide reduction (32Aslund F. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these proteins have redundant functions, whereas others are more specific (50Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that the thioredoxin reductase system can stimulate the assembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in a redox transcription factor SoxR in the presence of ferrous iron and sulfide in vitro (51Ding H. Demple B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17280-17286Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and that glutaredoxins can promote the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in the oxygen sensor FNR in the presence of l-cysteine, cysteine desulfurase (NifSAV), and ferrous iron (52Achebach S.

Recent genetic studies further indicated that one of the glutaredoxins (glutaredoxin 5) in S. cerevisiae is critical for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in mitochondria (53Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Because only catalytic amounts of thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin reductase are required for mediating the iron binding in IscA (Figs. 1 and 2) and for promoting the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in IscU (Figs. 5 and 6), it is most likely that the thioredoxin reductase system merely provides a reducing environment for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. Conceivably, a deficiency of the reduced thioredoxin 1 and its homologues (32Aslund F. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would dramatically limit the overall biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins in cells. A picture emerging from the studies reported here and previously (21Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol.

It has been reported that the expression of IscS, IscU, and IscA in the gene cluster iscSUA-hscBA-fdx is controlled by a redox transcription factor IscR, an iron-sulfur cluster containing protein (54Schwartz C.J. Giel J.L. Patschkowski T. Luther C. Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). IscR normally acts as a repressor that blocks the expression of the iscSUA genes (54Schwartz C.J. Giel J.L. Patschkowski T. Luther C. Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). When there is a demand for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in cells, the iron-sulfur cluster in IscR is disassembled and apo-IscR fails to repress the expression of the iscSUA genes, allowing the production of IscS, IscU, and IscA (54Schwartz C.J. Giel J.L. Patschkowski T. Luther C. Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In this context, we would like to propose that IscS (a sulfur donor), IscU (a scaffold), and IscA (an iron donor) may constitute the core of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery. The other proteins encoded by the hscBA-fdx genes (10Hoff K.G. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Biol.

We now report that introduction of the human papillomavirus E7 or E6 oncogenes into human papillomavirus-negative cells rescues the BRCA1 repression of ER-α activity and that the E7 and E6 oncoproteins interact directly with BRCA1 in vitro and associate with BRCA1 in vivo in cultured cells. This interaction involves at least two contact points on BRCA1, one within an N-terminal site shown previously to interact with ER-α and the other in a C-terminal region of BRCA1 containing the first BRCA1 C-terminal domain. Point mutations within the zinc finger domains of E7 and E6 inactivated the binding to the N terminus of BRCA1 and reduced their ability to rescue BRCA1 inhibition of ER-α. E6 and E7 also antagonized the ability of BRCA1 to inhibit c-Myc E-box-mediated transactivation and human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter activity, in a manner dependent upon the zinc finger domains. Finally, the ability of E6 and E7 to antagonize BRCA1 did not involve proteolytic degradation of BRCA1. These findings suggest functional interactions of BRCA1 with E7 and E6.

A large study of cancer risk in BRCA1 cancer families in Europe and North America revealed that BRCA1 mutation carriers are also at significantly increased risk for the development of several other cancer types, including pancreatic cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, and prostate cancer (in men younger than age 65) (4Thompson D. Easton D.F. the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). For cervical cancer, the relative risk of BRCA1 mutation carriers compared with noncarriers was 3.72 (95% confidence interval = 2.26–6.10, p < 0.001, two-sided test). A subset of patients with sporadic invasive cervical cancer shows hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (5Narayan G. Arias-Pulido H. Nandula S.V. Basso K. Sugirtharaj D.D. Vargas H. Mansukhani M.

An earlier and smaller study of cancer incidence in the relatives of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers revealed about a 4-fold increased risk of cervical cancer in BRCA2-associated families, although the risk in BRCA1 families was not similarly elevated (9Johannsson O.

Most interestingly, loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 17q, a site that contains the BRCA1 gene, appears to be a common event in cervical cancer (10Miyai K. Furugen Y. Matsumoto T. Iwabuchi K.

Previously, we found that the overexpression of BRCA1 inhibits the estrogen (E2)-induced transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) and inhibits E2-stimulated gene expression (11Fan S. Wang J. Yuan R. Ma Y. Meng Q. Erdos M.R. Pestell R.G. Yuan F. Auborn K.J. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1354-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 12Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang C.

Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2031-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most unexpectedly, the ability of BRCA1 to repress ER-α activity was found to be cell type-specific. Thus, BRCA1 virtually abolished E2-stimulated ER-α activity in four of four human breast cancer (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-453) and four of four human prostate cancer (DU-145, LNCaP, PC-3, and TsuPr-1 (now known to be derived from a bladder cancer)) cell lines; however, BRCA1 caused only a modest or no reduction of ER-α activity in four of four human cervical cell lines (HeLa, SiHa, CaSki, and C33A) (11Fan S.

Moreover, BRCA1 overexpression inhibited the E2-stimulated activity of activation function-2, the ligand-inducible transcriptional activation domain of ER-α in breast and prostate cancer cells but not in cervical cancer cell lines (11Fan S.

Three of the four cervical cancer cell lines that we studied (HeLa, SiHa, and Caski) are known to contain integrated oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) genomes: HPV-16 for SiHa and CaSki and HPV-18 for HeLa (15Meissner J.D.

The two major HPV oncoproteins, E7 and E6, function in part by inactivating host cell tumor suppressor proteins, retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) (and other retinoblastoma family proteins) and p53 (17Scheffner M. Whitaker N.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings raised the possibility that HPV proteins may functionally inactivate BRCA1 in cervical cancer cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that the HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 can interact with and inactivate the function of BRCA1.

Subconfluent proliferating cells in 24-well dishes were incubated overnight with 0.25 μg of each indicated vector in serum-free DMEM containing Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen). The total transfected DNA was kept constant by addition of the appropriate control vectors. The cells were washed, incubated in phenolphthalein-free DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped serum (obtained from the Tissue Culture Core Facility of the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center) (0.2 ml per well) ± 17β-estradiol (E2, 1 μm or 10 nm, as indicated) for 24 h, and harvested for luciferase assays. To control for transfection efficiency, plasmid pRSV-β-gal was co-transfected to allow normalization of luciferase values to β-galactosidase activity in the same sample. Values are means ± S.E. of four replicate wells and are representative of two or more independent experiments. To study the association of the endogenous BRCA1 and oncoprotein E7, proliferating SiHa cells at about 80% of confluence in 100-mm plastic dishes were harvested; and whole cell extracts were prepared as described before (12Fan S.

Each IP was carried out as described before by using 10 μg of antibody (anti-BRCA1 (I-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-E7 (ED-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or nonimmune rabbit or mouse IgG (negative control)) and 500 μg of total cell extract protein. The precipitated proteins were collected using protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and eluted using boiling Laemmli sample buffer. The eluted proteins were then subjected to Western blotting to detect the BRCA1 or E7 proteins, as described below. To study the interaction of BRCA1 with E6, subconfluent proliferating 293T cells were transfected overnight with the p3XFLAG-E6 and wtBRCA1 expression vectors (see above) using LipofectamineTM, washed, post-incubated for 24 h to allow gene expression, harvested, and then immunoprecipitated using anti-BRCA1 (as above) or nonimmune rabbit IgG (control). The precipitated proteins were collected using protein A/G Plus-agarose beads or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), washed, eluted, and subjected to Western blotting to detect the BRCA1 protein or the FLAG epitope (see below). Western blotting was carried out as described before (23Fan S. Yuan R. Ma Y.X. Meng Q. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8215-8235Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Ma Y.X.

The IPs (see above) were electrophoresed on a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore), and blotted using primary antibodies directed against BRCA1 (C-20, rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200); E7 (TVG710Y, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or the FLAG epitope (M2, mouse monoclonal antibody, Sigma, 1:500 dilution). As a control, nonprecipitated lysates (50 μg of cell protein) were blotted on the same gels. The blotted protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences), with colored markers (BioRad) as size standards. In a separate experiment, cells were transfected overnight with wild-type or mutant FLAG-E6 or FLAG-E7, post-incubated for 24 h to allow gene expression, and Western-blotted (50 μg of total cell protein per lane) to detect BRCA1 (C-20 antibody), E6 protein (anti-HPV16/18 E6, Abcam Ltd.), FLAG-E7 (M2, Sigma), p53 (polyclonal antibody 240, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (which detects both wild-type and mutant p53), RB1 (C-15 antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and α-actin (I-19 antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (control for loading and transfer). GST bead assays were performed essentially as described earlier (12Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang C. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Wang J.A. Erdos M. Goldberg I.D. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Pestell R.G. Rosen E.M.

In vitro translated (IVT) proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation, using the T7 promoter of the pcDNA3 vector or the T3 promoter of the pCMV-Tag2B vector. The proteins were labeled using [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) or Transend™ tRNA (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and in vitro transcription-translation was carried out using the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GST fusion proteins were generated from cDNAs cloned into the pGEX2T vector, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The source or construction of the expression vectors for various GST-BRCA1, GST-E7, and GST-E6 proteins is described above. Labeled IVT proteins were incubated with GST protein (negative control) or GST fusion proteins for 4 h at 4°C, recovered using GSH-agarose beads, eluted in boiling sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE autoradiography. In all GST capture assays, the IVT input lanes show 10% of the protein quantity used in the GST capture assays. All experiments included a lane corresponding to capture by beads coated with GST alone, as a negative control. The GST fusion proteins were visualized by Western blotting, using anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody 27-4577-01 (Amersham Biosciences, 1:5000). Additional details relevant to specific experiments are provided in the text or figure legends. The BRCA1 and corresponding control (scrambled sequence) siRNAs have been described earlier (29Xiong J.

All siRNAs were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. The sequences used to synthesize the siRNAs were as follows: BRCA1 siRNA, 5′-AATGCCAAAGTAGCTAATGTA-3′, and control siRNA, 5′-CGATAGATACACAGATTGAAT-3′. For siRNA treatments, subconfluent proliferating cells were transfected with 50 nm of siRNA using the siPORT Amine transfection reagent (Ambion). The maximal reduction of protein levels required a 72-h incubation with the siRNA. Prior studies established that under these conditions, none of the siRNAs caused cytotoxicity, based on cell morphology and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Where appropriate, statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's t test. Rescue (Reversal) of the BRCA1-mediated Repression of ER-α Transcriptional Activity by HPV Oncoproteins E7 and E6—We tested the ability of several different DNA tumor virus-encoded transforming oncoproteins to rescue (reverse) the BRCA1-mediated repression of ER-α activity, including HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7, the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein, and the SV40 large T protein. Schematic diagrams showing the domain structure of these proteins are provided in Fig. 1A. We utilized a standard transient transfection assay of ER-α transcriptional activity using an estrogen-responsive reporter, ERE-TK-Luc (12Fan S. Ma Y.X. Wang C. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Wang J.A. Erdos M.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1831-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, in the absence of E7 or E6, exogenous wtBRCA1 reduced the estrogen (E2)-stimulated reporter activity to less than 1% of the control value (p < 0.001, two-tailed t test) in human breast (MCF-7 and T47D) and prostate (DU-145) cancer cells, whereas the empty pcDNA3 vector had little or no effect on the reporter activity. In contrast, expression vectors encoding the E7 and E6 oncoproteins from HPV-16 (an oncogenic HPV strain) rescued the wtBRCA1-mediated repression of ER-α activity in HPV-negative human breast and prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B). Besides E7 and E6, several other DNA viral oncoproteins were also able to rescue the BRCA1 inhibition of ER-α transcriptional activity. Thus, in studies of DU-145 human prostate cancer and T47D breast cancer cells, the adenovirus E1A-(243R) and SV40 large T oncogenes also rescued the BRCA1 inhibition of ER-α activity (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively). The E1A-(243R) transforming protein is the product of an alternatively spliced mRNA, the full-length form of which encodes the E1A-(289R) protein (30Hurwitz D.R. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). E1A-(243R) differs from E1A-(289R) in that E1A-(243R) is missing a conserved region (CR3) that is present in E1A-(289R). Studies of a small series of mutant E1A-(243R) genes revealed that expression vectors encoding proteins with an N-terminal mutation or deletion (RG2, Δ38–67, RG2/928m, and Δ15–35) failed to rescue the BRCA1 repression, whereas those containing several other mutations (928m and YH47/928m) retained the ability to reverse the BRCA1-mediated repression of ER-α activity (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1C). E1A-(928m) encodes a mutant protein with a defective retinoblastoma (RB) protein binding domain, suggesting that the RB binding domain is dispensable for the rescue of BRCA1-mediated repression. Expression vectors encoding wild-type SV40 large T and a mutant with a defective RB binding domain both rescued the BRCA1 repression (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1D), again suggesting that interaction with RB family proteins (RB1, p107, and p130) is not required for rescue. For reference, Fig. 1E shows the effect of wtBRCA1 on ER-α signaling in three human cervical cancer cell lines, each of which contains an oncogenic HPV genome (HPV-16 or HPV-18) as follows: CaSki, SiHa, and HeLa. As compared with the HPV-negative breast and prostate cancer cell lines for which wtBRCA1 caused a reduction in estrogen-stimulated ER-α activity t"

To understand this interaction, we determined the crystal structure of PDXK in complex with (R)-roscovitine, N6-methyl-(R)-roscovitine, and O6-(R)-roscovitine, the two latter derivatives being designed to bind to PDXK but not to CDKs. Structural analysis revealed that these three roscovitines bind similarly in the pyridoxal-binding site of PDXK rather than in the anticipated ATP-binding site. The pyridoxal pocket has thus an unexpected ability to accommodate molecules different from and larger than pyridoxal.

Among the numerous inhibitors that have been identified, roscovitine, one of the early compounds, appears to be relatively potent and selective. Because of its cell growth inhibiting and neuroprotective activities, this purine is currently considered as a potential drug to treat, respectively, cancers, glomerulonephritis, and various neurodegenerative diseases (20Meijer L. Raymond E. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Roscovitine exists as two stereoisomers, (R)-roscovitine and (S)-roscovitine, the (R)-roscovitine isomer being slightly more active on CDKs (21Azevedo W.F. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Havlicek L. Strnad M.

Chem. 2005; 48: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Like most CDK inhibitors it binds to the catalytic site of the kinases and acts as a competitive inhibitor for ATP binding (21Azevedo W.F. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Kim S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 27Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J.

Because many inhibitors act by interacting within the ATP-binding pocket of their target kinases, a most conserved domain among the 518+ human kinases, concern about their selectivity is sensible. In the accompanying article (32Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Oscillation Data Reduction Program. Science and Engineering Research Council/Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar), we showed that (R)-roscovitine is a relatively selective CDK inhibitor, based on a selectivity study involving 148 kinases (23Bach S. Knockaert M. Lozach O. Reinhardt J. Baratte B. Schmitt S. Coburn S.P. Tang L. Jiang T. Liang D.C. Galons H. Dierick J.F. Totzke F. Schächtele C. Lerman A.S. Carnero A. Wan Y. Gray N. Meijer L. J.

This good selectivity was recently confirmed by a new in vitro kinase/ligand competition assay (28Fabian M.A. Biggs W.H. Treiber D.K. Atteridge C.E. Azimioara M.D. Benedetti M.G. Carter T.A.

Zarrinkar P.P. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). However, affinity chromatography on immobilized (R)-roscovitine revealed that (R)-roscovitine interacts with PDXK from various biological sources (23Bach S. Knockaert M. Lozach O. Reinhardt J. Baratte B. Schmitt S. Coburn S.P. Tang L. Jiang T. Liang D.C. Galons H. Dierick J.F. Totzke F. Schächtele C. Lerman A.S. Carnero A. Wan Y. Gray N. Meijer L. J. Biol.

In addition, this study showed that ATP competes with the binding of ERK1, ERK2, CDK5, and PDXK to roscovitine, whereas pyridoxal only competes with the binding of PDXK, but not of the protein kinases. In this study we have solved the crystal structure of PDXK in complex with (R)-roscovitine and with two roscovitine derivatives designed not to interact with CDKs. All three purines were found to bind at the pyridoxal-binding site of PDXK, rather than at the expected ATP-binding site. Analysis of the PDXK/roscovitine crystal structure will allow the design of derivatives exclusively interacting with either CDKs or PDXK, thereby leading to new generations of roscovitine-derived pharmacological inhibitors of potential therapeutic interest. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. Structural assignments were achieved by one- and two-dimensional methods. Roscovitine enantiomers were prepared according to Wang et al.

Briefly, to a solution of benzyl-(2-chloro-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-6-yl)-methyl-amine (1) (1.2 g, 4 mmol) in 5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was added (R)-(-)-2-amino-1-butanol or (S)-(+)-2-amino-1-butanol (1 ml, 5 mmol). The mixture was stirred 3 h at 120 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was diluted with water (150 ml) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 ml). The organic layer was washed twice with brine, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated.

The reaction mixture was diluted with water (10 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 ml). The organic layers were combined and dried with Na2SO4. The drying agent was removed and the solvent was evaporated. The resulting residue was purified by HPLC (C18 column, eluted with CH3CN/H2O with 0.035% trifluoroacetic acid) to afford the title compound as colorless oil (50 mg, 51%).

It was stirred at room temperature under hydrogen atmosphere for 10 min, and the catalyst was removed by filtration. Methanol was removed in vacuum to afford a colorless oil. It was further purified by HPLC (C18 column, eluted with CH3CN/H2O with 0.035% trifluoroacetic acid) to afford the title compound as a colorless oil (62 mg, 92%).

Pork brains were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and directly homogenized and processed for affinity chromatography or stored at -80 °C prior to use. Tissues were weighed, homogenized, and sonicated in homogenization buffer (2 ml/g of material). Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered, assayed for protein content (Bio-Rad protein assay), and immediately loaded batchwise on the affinity matrix. Just before use, 10 μl of packed roscovitine beads were washed with 1 ml of bead buffer and resuspended in 600 μl of this buffer. The tissue extract supernatant (3 mg of total protein) was then added; the tubes were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. After a brief spin at 10,000 × g and removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed 4 times with bead buffer before addition of 60 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Following heat denaturation for 3 min, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or silver staining as described below. Some antibodies were obtained from commercial sources: anti-CDK5 C-8 (Santa Cruz, Sc-173, 1:500, 1 h), anti-ERK1/2 (Sigma, M7927, 1:4000, 1 h). Anti-PDXK was generated by Eurogentec Europe (Double XP program). Two rabbits were immunized with a mixture of two human PDXK internal peptides: LLAWTHKHPNNLK (amino acids 241-253) and LRMVQSKRDIEDPEI (amino acids 291-305). The resulting antiserum (1:500, 1 h) cross-reacts with PDXK from a variety of species including mouse, rat, porcine, monkey, and human. Following heat denaturation for 3 min, the proteins bound to the roscovitine matrix were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (0.7 mm thick gels) followed by immunoblotting analysis or silver staining using an Amersham SDS-PAGE silver staining kit. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). These were blocked with 5% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20, incubated for 1 h with antibodies, and analyzed by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Homogenization Buffer—Homogenization buffer was 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 25 mm Mops (pH 7.2), 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylphosphate, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 10 μg aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor/ml, and 100 μm benzamidine. Buffer C—Homogenization buffer but 5 mm EGTA, no NaF, and no protease inhibitors. Kinase activities were assayed in buffer C, at 30 °C, at a final ATP concentration of 15 μm. Blank values were subtracted and activities were calculated as picomoles of phosphate incorporated during a 10-min incubation. The activities were expressed in % of the maximal activity, i.e. in the absence of inhibitors. Controls were performed with appropriate dilutions of dimethyl sulfoxide. Unless otherwise stated, the P81 phosphocellulose assay was used. CDK1/Cyclin B—CDK1/cyclin B was extracted in homogenization buffer from M phase starfish (Marthasterias glacialis) oocytes and purified by affinity chromatography on p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads, from which it was eluted by free p9CKShs1 as previously described (27Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The kinase activity was assayed in buffer C, with 1 mg of histone H1/ml, in the presence of 15 μm [γ-33P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; 10 mCi/ml) in a final volume of 30 μl. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, 25-μl aliquots of supernatant were spotted onto 2.5 × 3-cm pieces of Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper, and 20 s later, the filters were washed five times (for at least 5 min each time) in a solution of 10 ml of phosphoric acid/liter of water. The wet filters were counted in the presence of 1 ml of ACS (Amersham Biosciences) scintillation fluid. CDK2/Cyclin E—CDK2/cyclin E was obtained from insect cell lysates, purified on p9CKShs1-Sepharose, and assayed as described for CDK1/cyclin B. CDK5/p25—CDK5/p25 was reconstituted by mixing equal amounts of recombinant mammalian CDK5 and p25 expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (vectors kindly provided by Dr. J. H. Wang) (p25 is a truncated version of p35, the 35-kDa CDK5 activator). Its activity was assayed with histone H1 in buffer C as described for CDK1/cyclin B. CK1—Native CK1 was purified from rat liver and assayed in buffer C, with casein, in the presence of 15 μm [γ-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; 10 mCi/ml) in a final volume of 30 μl. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, 25-μl aliquots of supernatant were loaded on 3MM filters and extensively washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, before counting. DYRK1A—DYRK1A was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli (vector kindly provided by Dr. W. Becker, Institute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Aachen, Germany) and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose. Its kinase activity was assayed in buffer C, with 0.16 mg of myelin basic protein/ml, in the presence of 15 μm [γ-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; 10 mCi/ml) in a final volume of 30 μl. After 30 min incubation at 30 °C, 25-μl aliquots of supernatant were treated as described above. ERK2—ERK2 was obtained as a His-tagged recombinant enzyme and activated by recombinant mitogen-actived protein kinase kinase. It was assayed as described above for CDK1/cyclin B. Pyridoxal kinase was isolated and purified from sheep brain as described previously (1Kerry J.A. Rohde M. Kwok F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crystals of PDXK in complex with roscovitine and its derivatives were obtained by co-crystallization under conditions similar to those used for the PDXK/AMP-PCP/pyridoxamine crystallization (8Li M.H.

For the PDXK·(R)-roscovitine and PDXK·N6-methyl-(R)-roscovitine complexes, a protein solution was prepared containing 10 mg/ml PDXK and 3 mm roscovitine in 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 8.2). Crystals of PDXK complexes with these two purines were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique with a reservoir solution of 1.4 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 8.2), in a drop obtained by mixing 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals appeared after about 1 month at a constant 17 °C. Similar conditions were used for the crystallization of the PDXK·O6-(R)-roscovitine complex, except that pH was 6.4. X-ray diffraction data for PDXK/(R)-roscovitine co-crystals were collected using a Mar345 image plate in the Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, Institute of High Energy Physics (Beijing, China). Data for PDXK/O6-(R)-roscovitine and PDXK/N6-methyl-(R)-roscovitine crystals were collected using a Rigaku R-Axis-IP IV++ imaging plate area detector in the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China). Before data collection, the crystals were flash frozen in liquid N2 after being immersed in Paratone-N oil, used as a cryoprotectant. The data were processed with the HKL suite of programs (32Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Oscillation Data Reduction Program. Science and Engineering Research Council/Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar) and Raxis data processing software. The three complex structures were solved by molecular replacement using AMORE (33Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and solutions were obtained using the unliganded structure (Protein Data Bank code 1LHP) as search model.

The purified pseudopodial fraction contains phosphotyrosinated proteins, including Met and FAK, and various signaling proteins, including Raf1, MEK1, ERK2, PKBα (Akt1), GSK3α, GSK3β, Rb, and Stat3. Pseudopodial proteins identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry included actin and actin-regulatory proteins (ERM, calpain, filamin, myosin, Sra-1, and IQGAP1), tubulin, vimentin, adhesion proteins (vinculin, talin, and β1 integrin), glycolytic enzymes, proteins associated with protein translation, RNA translocation, and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, as well as protein chaperones (HSP90 and HSC70) and signaling proteins (RhoGDI and ROCK). Inhibitors of MEK1 (U0126) and HSP90 (geldanamycin) significantly reduced MSV-MDCK-INV cell motility and pseudopod expression, and geldanamycin treatment inhibited Met phosphorylation and induced the expression of actin stress fibers. ROCK inhibition did not inhibit cell motility but transformed the pseudopodial protrusions of MSV-MDCK-INV cells into extended lamellipodia. Dominant negative Rho disrupted pseudopod expression and, in serum-starved cells, l-α-lysophosphatidic acid (oleoyl) activation of Rho induced pseudopodial protrusions or, in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor, extended lamellipodia. RNA was localized to the actin-rich pseudopodial domains of MSV-MDCK-INV cells, but the extent of colocalization with dense actin ruffles was reduced in the extended lamellipodia formed upon ROCK inhibition. Rho/ROCK activation in epithelial tumor cells therefore regulates RNA translocation to a pseudopodial domain that contains proteins involved in signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, glycolysis, and protein translation and degradation.

Rho/ROCK activation in epithelial tumor cells therefore regulates RNA translocation to a pseudopodial domain that contains proteins involved in signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, glycolysis, and protein translation and degradation. The repeated, directional extension and stabilization by substrate adhesive contacts of pseudopodia constitute the basic mechanism by which cells move over a substrate (1Lauffenberger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). Cell motility is therefore associated with the polarized formation of a distinct plasma membrane domain, the pseudopod, whose stabilization determines the directionality of cell movement (2Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor stimulation of Rho GTPases and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) activates WASp/Scar proteins at the leading edge recruiting Arp2/3 and actin monomers to induce actin filament branching and membrane protrusion (3Pollard T.D.

Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pseudopodia of MSV-MDCK-INV cells are strongly labeled for β-actin by immunofluorescence, and the purified pseudopodial fraction (PPF) is enriched for β-actin and depleted of mitochondrial proteins relative to the total cell lysate (4Le P.U. Nguyen T.N. Drolet-Savoie P. Leclerc N. Nabi I.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1631-1635PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nguyen T.N. Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Glycolysis represents a critical energy supply for tumor cell motility (7Beckner M.E. Stracke M.L. Liotta L.A. Schiffmanm E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and identification of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by Edman degradation in purified pseudopodia of MSV-MDCK-INV cells led to the demonstration that glycolysis regulates the formation and protrusion of tumor cell pseudopodia (6Nguyen T.N. Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using a scaled up pseudopod purification approach, we show here that the pseudopodial domain of MSV-MDCK-INV cells contains phosphorylated Met and FAK as well as a number of downstream signaling proteins, including Raf1, MEK1, ERK2, PKBα (Akt1), GSK3α, GSK3β, Rb, and Stat3. A subsequent proteomic analysis identified other regulators of Met activity, including RhoGDI, ROCK2, and HSP90, as well as major classes of proteins that included cytoskeleton-associated proteins, such as actin, tubulin, vimentin, and actin- and tubulin-associated proteins, glycolytic enzymes and protein chaperones, as well as proteins associated with RNA translocation, protein translation, and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Pseudopodial protrusion was inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor U0126 and by inhibition of HSP90 activity with geldanamycin, which was also shown to inhibit constitutive Met activation. ROCK inhibition with Y27632 did not affect cell motility but transformed the protrusive pseudopodia into extended lamellipodia. Inhibition of ROCK was associated with reduced RNA targeting to the lamellipodia showing that Rho/ROCK activation recruits RNA to the pseudopodial domain of MSV-MDCK-INV cells for local translation. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-β-actin, anti-BiP/GRP78, and antitalin were purchased from Sigma;, anti-FAK and anti-phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr; PY-99), anti-phospho-RB1 (S780), anti-HSC70, and anti-lamin A/C were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-phospho-Met (Y1230, Y1234, and Y1235), anti-phospho-FAK Y397, and anti-phospho-FAK Y577 were from BIOSOURCE International; anti-p97(VCP) was from Abcam Inc.; anti-calpain 2 and anti-paxillin were from Calbiochem; anti-HSP90 was from Stressgen; anti-EF1α was from Upstate; anti-nuclear pore complex proteins (NPC; MAb414) were from Covance Research Products; anti-vinculin, anti-α5β1 integrin, and anti-GAPDH were from Chemicon Inc.; and anti-mitochondrial HSP70 was from Affinity Bioreagents. pEGFP-actin plasmid was purchased from BD Biosciences, and Effectene transfection reagent was from Qiagen. 24-mm Falcon polycarbonate filters (1-μm pore size) were purchased from VWR, and 100-mm diameter 1-μm pore filters were from SPI Supplies (West Chester, PA). Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, Sytox green, propidium iodide, geldanamycin, and secondary antibodies conjugated to either Alexa488, Alexa568, or Alexa633 were purchased from Molecular Probes. l-α-Lysophosphatidic acid, oleoyl (LPA) was purchased from Sigma, and Y27632, LY294002, and U0126 were from Calbiochem. Cell Culture and Pseudopod Purification—MSV-MDCK-INV cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, glutamine, and vitamins (Canadian Life Sciences) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Immunocorp, Laval, QC) in a 5% CO2/air humidified incubator as previously described (4Le P.U. Nguyen T.N. Drolet-Savoie P. Leclerc N. Nabi I.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1631-1635PubMed Google Scholar). MSV-MDCK-INV cells were transfected with pEGFP-actin or DN-Rho plasmids by Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), and stably EGFP-actin-transfected cells were selected with G418 (Invitrogen). MSV-MDCK-INV cells were plated on 1-μm pore filters at a density of 200,000 cells/cm2 for 24 h. MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia were purified using a scaled-up procedure similar to that previously described (6Nguyen T.N. Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 MSV-MDCK-INV cells were plated on 100-mm 1-μm pore filters mounted between two 76.2-88.9 mm custom-made washers (Boulons Plus, Anjou, QC) in a 100-mm Falcon Petri dish, and the exterior was sealed with agarose to prevent cell leakage to the bottom of the filter. After a 24-h culture, the filter was washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline/CM (0.1 mm calcium chloride and 1 mm magnesium chloride) and the top (cell bodies) and bottom (pseudopodia) of the filter scraped with a glass coverslip. The pseudopodia or cell bodies were recovered from the coverslip in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.05 mm p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidino benzoate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin). The recovered PPF was sonicated twice for 15 s on ice then centrifuged for 30 min at 150,000 rpm, and the supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was measured (BCA assay, Pierce). Samples used for the Kinetworks™ KPSS 1.3 Phosphosite Protein Screen (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp., Vancouver, BC) were immediately boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and shipped at room temperature as per the company's instructions (www.kinexus.ca). Immunofluorescence Labeling—Immunofluorescence labeling of cells plated sparsely for 1 day on glass coverslips or on 1-μm pore filter units (Falcon) was performed as previously described (6Nguyen T.N. Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (filter-grown cells and phalloidin labeling) or, for NPC and Lamin A/C labeling, with precooled (-80 °C) methanol/acetone (80%/20%). RNA was stained with 1 ng/μl propidium iodide, and, where indicated, fixed, permeabilized cells were pretreated with 50 ng/μl RNase at 37 °C for 30 min. Coverslips and filters mounted with the underside of the filter facing up were viewed with the 63× or 100× planapochromat objectives of a Leica TCS-SP1 confocal microscope or with the 60× or 100× planapochromat objectives of an FV1000 Olympus confocal microscope. The extent of overlap of fluorescently labeled cells with actin-dense pseudopodial domains was quantified using ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics). Phalloidin or actin-GFP images were thresholded to create masks of both the whole cell and actin-rich pseudopodial domains, which were then applied to the corresponding antibody-labeled image to obtain density (intensity/area) values for the actin-rich pseudopodial domain and the rest of the cell. At least 30 cells from a minimum of two experiments were analyzed per protein. Transient GFP transfections were performed for 20-24 h to limit overexpression of the transfected protein. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—MSV-MDCK-INV cells cultured overnight to ∼50-60% confluency were scraped, lysed, and sonicated in ice-cold lysis buffer as described above. Protein content of cell lysates and the cell body and pseudopodial fractions (PPFs) of MSV-MDCK-INV cells was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). 10-20 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper and blocked with 5% milk or, for phosphoprotein blots, with 4% bovine serum albumin, prior to probing with the appropriate primary antibodies and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The labeled bands were revealed by chemiluminescence and exposed to Kodak XRP-1 film. Mass Spectrometry—The PPF (190 μg) was separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, and excised gel bands were digested by Trypsin (Pro-mega, Madison, WI) on ProGest Digestion Robot (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the protocol described in Ref. 8. After lyophilization, tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry consisted of Ultimate high-performance liquid chromatography system with FAMOS Autosampler (LC Packings-Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and LCQ Deca Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). Peptides were separated on custom-made 75-μm i.d. PicoTip columns packed with 3-μm C-18 beads. The column effluent was sprayed directly into the interface of the mass spectrometer. The gradient used for separation was 3-60% of acetonitrile during 25 min, and the total run time was 45 min. Raw mass spectrometric data were screened against the NCBI data base using the Mascot search engine (Matrixscience, London, UK). A protein was considered as a hit if two independent peptides with individual scores higher than 40 were found. Single peptides with a score higher than 40 were validated manually based on their tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation. Purification of Tumor Cell Pseudopodia—MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia can be purified by plating the cells on polycarbonate filters of 1-μm pore diameter that permit the selective passage of MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia but not the cell body (6Nguyen T.N. Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 (A-D), the nucleus and actin-labeled cell body remain on the upper surface of the filter while actin-labeled protrusions pass through to the underneath of the filter. The pseudopodial protrusions that pass through the filter are labeled for phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr). Our prior studies on pseudopodia purification used 24-mm filter units (6Nguyen T.N. Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and we have scaled up the purification procedure using 100-mm diameter filters (for details see “Materials and Methods”). MSV-MDCK-INV cells exhibit increased total phosphotyrosine expression that concentrates in the pseudopodial domain (5Vadnais J. Nault G. Daher Z. Amraei M. Dodier Y. Nabi I.R. Noel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48342-48350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and we assessed the pattern of phosphotyrosine phosphorylation in the pseudopodial fraction by blotting with the anti-p-Tyr antibody PY-99 (Fig. 1E). Only slight differences in the phosphotyrosine expression pattern between the pseudopodial fraction and the cell lysate were observed. The major bands in both fractions migrated at 160, 125, and 60 kDa. Blotting with antibodies to phosphorylated HGFR/Met (p-Met Y1230, Y1234, and Y1235) and to FAK revealed that they comigrate with major phosphorylated bands at 160 and 125 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1E). By immunofluorescence, p-Met and p-FAK colocalize with actin and p-Tyr in the pseudopodial domain (Fig. 1, F-I). Activated forms of both Met and FAK are therefore present in MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia. We subsequently analyzed the PPF for expression of the phosphorylated forms of various signaling proteins using a panel of 31 different phospho-site antibodies with the Kinetworks™ KPSS-1.3 Screen. As seen in Fig. 2A, MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia express the phosphorylated forms of multiple signaling proteins consistent with localized autocrine Met activation, including Src, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, GSK3α/β, PKBα/Akt1, PKCα, Rb, and STAT3. Downstream Met signaling cascades are therefore active within the pseudopodia of MSV-MDCK-INV cells. The phospho-site screen also identified phosphorylated adducin-α, JNK, Raf1, and STAT1 as enriched in the pseudopodial fraction (Fig. 2B). The Pseudopod Proteome—A subsequent proteomic analysis of the pseudopodial fraction by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified 167 proteins from 34 Coomassie-identified bands (Table I). Bovine serum albumin and other serum proteins were picked up in the screen, and proteins of potential serum origin were deleted from the analysis. Identified proteins were classed into major families, including cytoskeleton-associated proteins (28 proteins), adhesion proteins (5 proteins), glycolytic enzymes (13 proteins), protein chaperones (10 proteins), translation-associated proteins (23 proteins), RNA-binding proteins (14Webb C.P. Hose C.D. Koochekpour S. Jeffers M. Oskarsson M. Sausville E. Monks A. Vande Woude G.F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar), ubiquitin/proteasome-associated proteins (11 proteins), signaling proteins (16 proteins), as well as proteins associated with membrane trafficking (6 proteins) and cellular organelles (13 proteins). Twenty-eight proteins could not be classified into these categories (Table I). Evidence for the selective nature of the domain that passes through the filter is evident from the abundance of actin, actin-associated proteins, tubulin, and glycolytic enzymes. The proteomic approach will necessarily pick up the most abundant proteins, and a crude indication of abundance can be obtained from the number of peptides identified that correspond to a specific protein. Although the molecular size of a protein will necessarily impact on the number of peptides identified, assessment of peptide number per class indicates clearly that the pseudopodial fraction is enriched for cytoskeletal proteins, glycolytic enzymes, protein chaperones, and translation associated proteins (Fig. 3). Based on the number of peptides the most abundant proteins in the pseudopodial fraction in addition to actin include the ERM proteins (ezrin, meosin, and radixin), myosin IX and VI, tubulin, vimentin, various glycolytic enzymes, the chaperones HSP90, HSC70, and CCT, elongation factors 1 and 2, the VCP/p97 AAA ATPase, and the signaling proteins ULIP and Sra1.Table IPseudopod proteomeFig. 3Protein classification of the pseudopod proteome. Based on the proteomic analysis and classification of MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia presented in Table I, the number of proteins (left) and total number of peptides identified per protein (right) per class are presented as pie charts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We confirmed the presence of a number of the major pseudopod-associated proteins by immunoblotting of the PPF and cell body fractions (Fig. 4). EF1α, HSP90, HSC70, calpain2, vinculin, paxillin, FAK, p-FAK, p97/VCP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and NPC are present in the pseudopodial fraction at levels corresponding to that of β-actin with calpain and paxillin exhibiting enrichment in the pseudopodial domain relative to actin. Faint bands for BiP and lamin A/C were detected in the PPF, and quantification showed that pseudopodial expression of these two proteins was minimal relative to the cell body and equivalent to that of mitochondrial HSP70, previously shown to be excluded from MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia (6Nguyen T.N. Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We subsequently used quantitative immunofluorescence to assess protein distribution to the actin-defined pseudopodial domain relative to the rest of the cell (Fig. 5). All the proteins exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic labeling to varying extents, nevertheless distinct distributions of the proteins to the pseudopodial domain were detected. Pseudopodial expression was quantified by comparing average pixel density in the phalloidin-labeled pseudopodial domain relative to the rest of the cell. To ensure that protein distribution to pseudopodia is not a volume effect and due to diffusion of cytosolic proteins, we transfected cells with GFP that exhibited a reduced density in the actin-dense pseudopodial domain relative to the rest of the cell (Fig. 5, A and B). As seen in Fig. 5Q, a number of proteins (vinculin, paxillin, phospho-FAK, calpain 2, talin, α5β1 integrin, EF1α, and pRb1) exhibited significant enrichment in the pseudopodia relative to GFP, whereas others exhibited a similar ratio (FAK, HSP70, HSC70, p97, and NPC) and others were depleted (lamin A/C, BiP, and calnexin). The diminished absolute ratio of pseudopodial labeling to the rest of the cell relative to the immunoblot data likely reflects the fact that the pseudopodial domain that penetrates the filter is not limited to the actin-rich portion of the elongated pseudopodial protrusions of MSV-MDCK-INV cells. Indeed, actin was only slightly enriched in the pseudopodial domain by immunoblot (Fig. 4) but significantly enriched (2.3-fold on average) by immunofluorescent quantification. The limited number of organelle-associated proteins detected in the proteomic analysis represents a strong indication of the purity of the fraction. Indeed, no Golgi, endosomal or lysosomal proteins were identified and few ER and mitochondrial proteins picked up. The major ER protein detected was BiP/GRP78, which is expressed on the cell surface and has recently been identified as a potential target for tumor therapy (9Arap M.A. Lahdenranta J. Mintz P.J. Hajitou A. Sarkis A.S. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 275-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). We were able to detect small amounts of BiP in the pseudopodial fraction by both blot and fluorescence (Figs. 4 and 5) and when compared with the distribution of another ER protein, calnexin, BiP exhibited increased extension to the pseudopodial domain (Fig. 5). Although eight nuclear proteins were identified, the majority are proteins associated with the nuclear pore and involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (i.e. lamin A/C, nucleoporin 93, karyopherin α2, ribonucleoprotein F, Ran, and transportin-SR) (10Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), whereas SMC1 and other members of the cohesin complex have been localized to the spindle complex during mitosis (11Gregson H.C. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.S. Kobayashi T. Zhou S. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47575-47582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, strong labeling of the nucleoporin complex was detected in the pseudopodial fraction by both blot and fluorescence (Figs. 4 and 5) validating the detection of nuclear pore associated proteins in the proteomic analysis. In the case of pRB1, that has been reported to be predominantly nuclear, enrichment in the pseudopodial fraction relative to the total cell lysate detected by the Kinetworks™ KPSS1.3 phospho-site analysis (Fig. 2B) was confirmed by quantitative immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 5). Lamin A/C was predominantly nuclear but could also be detected in the pseudopodia (Figs. 4 and 5) and, curiously, was recently found to selectively associate with paxillin in adherent cells (12de Hoog C.L. Foster L.J. Mann M. Cell. 2004; 117: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For lamin and BiP, their detection in the proteomic analysis therefore reflects not their pseudopodial enrichment but their overall cellular abundance. Nevertheless, limited relative expression does not necessarily exclude a functional role in this cellular domain. Rho/ROCK-dependent Pseudopodial Protrusion in MSV-MDCK-INV Cells—To identify the Met regulators involved in MSV-MDCK-INV cell motility and pseudopod formation, we treated the cells with specific inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002) and MEK (U0126) identified in the Kinetworks™ screen (Fig. 2) and of ROCK (Y27632) and HSP90 (geldanamycin) identified in the proteomic screen (Table I). Treatment of the cells with U0126 and geldanamycin inhibited MSV-MDCK-INV cell motility and also disrupted MSV-MDCK-INV cell morphology, resulting in enhanced cell spreading (Fig. 6). Geldanamycin-treated cells presented numerous actin stress fibers (Fig. 6F), as previously observed in cells where constitutive HGFR activation was disrupted (5Vadnais J. Nault G. Daher Z. Amraei M. Dodier Y. Nabi I.R. Noel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48342-48350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). HSP90 is known to be associated with Met signaling in cancer (13Maulik G. Kijima T. Ma P.C. Ghosh S.K. Lin J. Shapiro G.I. Schaefer E. Tibaldi E. Johnson B.E. Salgia R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar, 14Webb C.P. Hose C.D. Koochekpour S. Jeffers M. Oskarsson M. Sausville E. Monks A. Vande Woude G.F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar), and treatment of MSV-MDCK-INV cells for 4-6 h with geldanamycin selectively reduced constitutive Met activation (Fig. 6I) confirming a role for HSP90 as a regulator of Met activation in MSV-MDCK-INV cells. Treatment with LY294002 and Y27632 had limited effects on cell motility (Fig. 6A), however inhibition of ROCK with Y27632 altered cell morphology disrupting the expression of the protrusive pseudopodial domains of MSV-MDCK-INV cells and inducing the formation of extended lamellipodia (Fig. 6, G and H). Consistent with the role of ROCK as a regulator of pseudopodial protrusion, expression of DN-Rho resulted in the expression of highly elongated cells that presented neither actin-rich pseudopodia nor stress fibers (Fig. 7, A-D). In the majority (over 90%) of DN-Rho-transfected cells, the pseudopodial protrusions of MSV-MDCK-INV cells were disrupted, however, in some cells transfected with DN-Rho, myc-tagged DN-Rho could be clearly localized to residual actin-rich pseudopodia (Fig. 7, A and B, arrows). Serum-starved MSV-MDCK-INV cells present significantly reduced expression of actin-rich pseudopodia (Fig. 7E), and Rho activation with LPA for 30 min induced the expression of numerous actin densities (Fig. 7, F and H). LPA activation of Rho in the presence of Y27632 resulted in the formation of extended lamellipodial structures (Fig. 7, G and I). ROCK activation therefore regulates the morphology of the pseudopodial protrusions formed in the MSV-MDCK-INV cell line. The high concentration of pseudopodial proteins involved in protein synthesis and degradation is intriguing and argues that the pseudopod is undergoing extensive and dynamic remodeling of its protein composition. Multiple proteins associated with protein translation, including EF1α, have previously been localized to cellular protrusions (15Liu G. Grant W.M. Persky D. Latham Jr., V.M. Singer R.H. Condeelis J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Purification of RNA granules from neurons identified 28 proteins associated with mRNA, including EF1α, DDX1, DDX3, and"
https://openalex.org/W2055310726,"The mannose receptor (MR) is a heavily glycosylated endocytic receptor that recognizes both mannosylated and sulfated ligands through its C-type lectin domains and cysteine-rich (CR) domain, respectively. Differential binding properties have been described for MR isolated from different sources, and we hypothesized that this could be due to altered glycosylation. Using MR transductants and purified MR, we demonstrate that glycosylation differentially affects both MR lectin activities. MR transductants generated in glycosylation mutant cell lines lacked most mannose internalization activity, but could internalize sulfated glycans. Accordingly, purified MR bearing truncated Man5-GlcNAc2 glycans (Man5 -MR) or non-sialylated complex glycans (SA0-MR) did not bind mannosylated glycans, but could recognize SO4-3-Gal in vitro. Additional studies showed that, although mannose recognition was largely independent of the oligomerization state of the protein, recognition of sulfated carbohydrates was mostly mediated by self-associated MR and that, in SA0-MR, there was a higher proportion of oligomeric MR. These results suggest that self-association could lead to multiple presentation of CR domains and enhanced avidity for sulfated sugars and that non-sialylated MR is predisposed to oligomerize. Therefore, the glycosylation of MR, terminal sialylation in particular, could influence its binding properties at two levels.

In murine primary macrophages, this soluble form of MR (sMR) is generated from the cell-bound form by proteolytic cleavage by a metalloprotease (9Martinez-Pomares L. Mahoney J.A. Kaposzta R.

Our previous studies suggested that multimerization of the CR domain through the interaction of sMR with multivalent ligands for CTLD, such as mannan, leads to enhanced recognition of sulfated carbohydrates (11Zamze S.

We have demonstrated binding of the MR CR domain to sulfated carbohydrate ligands expressed by subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells associated with B cell follicles in spleen and lymph nodes (20Berney C.

In agreement with these results, recombinant fusion proteins bearing the MR CR domain specifically target cells bearing CR domain ligands in vivo (24Taylor P.R. Zamze S. Stillion R.J. Wong S.Y.

Because of its binding properties and tissue distribution, MR can be placed at the interface between homeostasis and immunity. MR mediates efficient clearance of endogenous molecules (5Pontow S.E.

Even though MR is expressed by most tissue macrophages, it is not macrophage-restricted and liver sinusoidal cells and nonvascular endothelia, among other cell types, have been shown to express MR (31Shepherd V.L.

In vitro, MR is expressed in human monocyte-derived and murine primary macrophages, but is absent in monocytes. In murine macrophages, MR is up-regulated in response to the Th2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and IL-10 (10Martinez-Pomares L. Reid D.M. Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Stillion R.J. Linehan S.A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) express MR. Previous studies have suggested that MR function is regulated in vivo. Kery et al. (37Kery V. Krepinsky J.J. Warren C.D. Capek P. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) observed large amounts of unbound MR after passing protein extracts from human placenta through a d-Man-coupled Sepharose column, suggesting that, in vivo, MR has functional diversity. Furthermore, MR purified from rat liver and lung have been shown to have different ligand binding activities, with the liver-specific form of MR displaying selective recognition of sulfated ligands (38Fiete D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14629-14637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Additional studies suggested that this selectivity could be due to receptor dimerization in the liver (39Roseman D.S. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9949-9954Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, an interaction has been detected between the lectin domain of L-selectin and MR expressed by lymphatic endothelia in human lymph nodes (30Irjala H. Johansson E.L. Grenman R. Alanen K. Salmi M. Jalkanen S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1033-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These results indicate that MR function might be modified in a cell- or tissue-dependent manner. Increasing evidence has shown that glycosylation is directly involved in the regulation of protein function, orientation, and organization during immune responses (40Barnes Y.C. Skelton T.P. Stamenkovic I. Sgroi D.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that carbohydrate modifications might play a role in modulating MR function. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the lectin activities of MR and its glycosylation and show, for the first time, that glycosylation, especially terminal sialylation, has a major effect on the functional specialization of MR. Cells—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were obtained from frozen stocks stored at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology and cultured in Ham's F-12K medium with 2 mm l-glutamine. LEC1 and LEC2 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured with α-minimal essential medium with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Invitrogen). Reagents—Man-polyacrylamide (PAA)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), SO4-3-Gal-PAA-FITC, and Gal-PAA-FITC were obtained from (Lectinity Corp., Moscow, Russia). Mannan was obtained from Sigma. Gal-bovine serum albumin (BSA) was obtained form EY Laboratories, Inc. (San Mateo, CA). The Alexa 488 labeling kit, Alexa 647-labeled dextran, Alexa 647-labeled transferrin, Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Purified monoclonal antibodies 5D3 and 6F3 and IgG2a were prepared in house. Fluorescent mounting medium was from DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, CA). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Hampshire, UK). Retroviral Transduction of MR in CHO, LEC1, and LEC2 Cells—The CHOMR, LEC1MR, and LEC2MR cells were generated as described (10Martinez-Pomares L. Reid D.M. Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Stillion R.J. Linehan S.A. Zamze S. Gordon S. Wong S.Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Detection of MR in Cell Lysates and Supernatants by Western Blotting—The cell lysates and supernatants were prepared and tested by Western blotting with anti-MR monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5D3 as described (10Martinez-Pomares L. Reid D.M. Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Stillion R.J. Linehan S.A. Zamze S. Gordon S. Wong S.Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Preparation of Total Tissue Lysates—Tissues were collected and kept frozen at –70 °C until used. Ice-cold lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, and 10 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) was added to tissues (100 mg of tissue/ml of lysis buffer). Tissues were homogenized using a Polytron and maintained on ice for 30 min. Soluble material was selected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and further centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C using a Ti-60 rotor. Preparation of Membrane Lysates—Organs were homogenized using a Polytron in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2.5% (v/v) Tween 40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, and 2 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C using a Ti-60 rotor. The membrane pellet was washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm NaN3, and 150 mm NaCl containing protease inhibitors, and proteins were solubilized in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C in a Ti-60 rotor. Protein Quantification—Protein was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Confocal Assays—To assess MR trafficking in CHO cells, CHOMR cells were incubated with Alexa 647-labeled dextran (10 μg/ml) and Man-PAA-FITC (10 μg/ml) in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 15 min. One set of cells was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature, whereas another set was washed twice with the medium and incubated further for 75 min in medium with 10% fetal calf serum before fixation. Fixed cells were blocked and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 with 1% goat serum and 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-MR mAb 5D3 (10 μg/ml) in blocking/permeabilization buffer for 60 min at room temperature, washed five times with PBS, and incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (10 μg/ml) in PBS for an additional 60 min at room temperature. To assess the subcellular distribution of MR, CHOMR, LEC1MR, and LEC2MR were incubated with Alexa 647-labeled transferrin (5 μg/ml) for 15 min and fixed. MR was detected using mAb 5D3 and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (5 μg/ml). Coverslips were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium. Immunofluorescence was analyzed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal laser scanning microscope with Lasersharp 2000 software, and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Endocytosis Analysis—MR-mediated endocytosis was assessed by incubating cells in the presence of conjugated ligands (5 μg/ml) for 2 h as described (10Martinez-Pomares L. Reid D.M. Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Stillion R.J. Linehan S.A. Zamze S. Gordon S. Wong S.Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur with CellQuest software. Selection of Cells with Similar MR-mediated Endocytic Activity by Cell Sorting—CHOMR, LEC1MR, and LEC2MR cells (5 × 106) were incubated with Alexa 488-labeled mAb 5D3 (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA prior to analysis to ensure that only ligand internalization was assessed. Homogeneous populations of CHOMR, LEC1MR, and LEC2MR cells were obtained by cell sorting using a DakoCytomation MoFlo cell sorter with an argon ion laser. MR Purification—A 0.5 × 5-cm affinity column and a GammaBind Plus-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) of the same size were prepared by packing 5 ml of mAb 5D3-cross-linked GammaBind Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and GammaBind Plus-Sepharose, respectively. After washing with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm NaN3, the cell culture supernatant was loaded onto the column (1 ml/min). After washing with the loading buffer, bound proteins were eluted using 0.5% diethylamine in 1% Triton X-100 (pH 11). 1-ml fractions were collected in 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) for neutralization. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. A similar procedure was used to purify MR from spleen and lung membrane lysates. Ligand Binding Assays—96-Well Maxisorp plates (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) were coated overnight at 37 °C with 50 μlof100 μg/ml mannan, 10 μg/ml Gal-BSA, or 10 μg/ml SO4-3-Gal-PAA in PBS and washed twice with binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 5 times; in the last wash, the plate was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min for blocking. Serial dilutions of MR (50 μl/well) were added to the plates and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h to allow binding to occur. Plates were washed eight times with binding buffer. mAb 5D3 (10 μg/ml) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, both diluted in binding buffer and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, were subsequently used to detect MR binding. Enzyme activity was developed with 50 μlof p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml; Sigma) and read at 405 nm after 30 min at 37 °C. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on an AKTA Superose 12 FPLC column (10 × 300 mm) in binding buffer. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance of the eluant was monitored at 280 nm; 34 fractions (0.5 ml each) from each sample were collected at V0 = 7.7 ml. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding experiments were performed by surface plasmon resonance on a Biacore 2000 instrument. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. SO4-3-Gal-PAA-biotin and Gal-PAA-biotin were covalently coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix on a research-grade CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) precoated with streptavidin using the Biacore amine coupling kit as directed by the manufacturer with the following modifications. After an activation step of 300–600 s, MR in binding buffer without Tween 20 was injected for 300–900 s at 10 μl/min. The basic amine coupling buffer was 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.015 m CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl, and the flow rate was set at 10 μl/min. 70 μl of 1ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide mixture was injected to activate the chip surface. Immediately after activation, 70 μlof streptavidin was covalently coupled to the research-grade CM5 sensor chip via primary amine groups using the amine coupling kit. Then, 70 μl of ethanolamine was applied to block the sensor chip surface. Finally, the “dips” were checked to confirm that the immobilization was homogeneous. N-Linked Glycan Analysis—sMR bearing sialylated (SA-sMR) and non-sialylated (SA0-sMR) complex glycans were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were excised. In situ release of N-glycans with peptide N-glycanase F (Oxford GlycoSciences, Abingdon, Oxon, UK) was carried out. The extracted glycans were labeled with the fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide (Oxford GlycoSciences) by reductive amination and processed by normal-phase HPLC using a low salt buffer system (45Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The system was calibrated using an external standard of hydrolyzed and 2-aminobenzamide-labeled glucose oligomers to provide a dextran ladder from which the retention times for the individual glycans were converted to glucose units. These glucose units were compared with a data base of experimental values to obtain preliminary assignments for the glycans that were confirmed by digestion with exoglycosidases and by mass spectrometry. The following exoglycosidases were purchased from Glyko (Novato, CA): Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (1–2 units/ml), bovine testis β-galactosidase (1 unit/ml), bovine kidney α-fucosidase (1 unit/ml), and S. pneumoniae hexosaminidase (1 unit/ml). Assessment of Glycans Associated with MR by Lectin Blotting—To determine the sugars associated with MR purified from spleen and lung, a digoxigenin glycan differentiation kit (Roche Applied Science) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MR from spleen and lung were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described above. After blocking, filters were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl), and once with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2). Filters were incubated with digoxigenin-conjugated lectins in buffer A. After washes with Tris-buffered saline, filters were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-digoxigenin F(ab′)2 fragment (0.75 unit/ml). Bound enzyme was detected using 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Carboxypeptidase Y was used as a positive control for the lectins peanut agglutinin and Datura stramonium agglutinin. Generation of MR Transductants in Glycosylation Mutant Cells: LEC1MR and LEC2MR—To determine whether glycosylation influences MR function, three stable cell lines expressing MR (CHOMR, LEC1MR, and LEC2MR) were generated by transducing CHO, LEC1, and LEC2 cells (44Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), respectively, using a retroviral vector encoding murine full-length MR as described (10Martinez-Pomares L. Reid D.M. Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Stillion R.J. Linehan S.A. Zamze S. Gordon S. Wong S.Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). LEC1 cells lack GlcNAc-glycosyltransferase activity, so N-linked carbohydrates are blocked at the Man5-GlcNAc2-Asn intermediate. LEC2 cells exhibit a drastic reduction in the transport of CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi compartment, and all carbohydrates lack terminal sialylation. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that MR expression in LEC1MR cells was very low and that LEC1MR and LEC2MR cells were not homogeneous, as two different populations could be observed (data not shown). As most of the MR localizes in the early endosomal compartment and not at the plasma membrane, to normalize for MR expression, we selected for CHOMR, LEC1MR, and LEC2MR cells with similar ability to internalize labeled anti-MR mAb 5D3 (10Martinez-Pomares L. Reid D.M. Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Stillion R.J. Linehan S.A. Zamze S. Gordon S. Wong S.Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) using cell sorting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Harvesting the cells using trypsin/EDTA prior to analysis ensured that ligand internalization and not cell association was being assessed in these assays because MR is trypsin-sensitive. After sorting, we obtained homogeneous cell populations suitable for our studies, even though the internalization of anti-MR mAb by LEC1MR and LEC2MR cells was still reduced compared with CHOMR cells (CHOMR/LEC1MR/LEC2MR = 100:64:80) (Fig. 1). The mAb internalization data seemed to give a good indication of the levels of MR expressed by the transductants, as they correlated with the results obtained by Western blot analysis (see Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3sMR with the expected N-linked glycans is produced by CHOMR, LEC1MR, and LEC2MR cells.A, cMR and sMR with the expected relative molecul"
https://openalex.org/W2061791602,"Activation of the Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT1α signaling pathway is repressed in Leishmania-infected macrophages. This represents an important mechanism by which this parasite subverts the microbicidal functions of the cell to promote its own survival and propagation. We recently provided evidence that the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-1 was responsible for JAK2 inactivation. However, STAT1 translocation to the nucleus was not restored in the absence of SHP-1. In the present study, we have used B10R macrophages to study the mechanism by which this Leishmania-induced STAT1 inactivation occurs. STAT1α nuclear localization was shown to be rapidly reduced by the infection. Western blot analysis revealed that cellular STAT1α, but not STAT3, was degraded. Using PTP inhibitors and an immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophage cell line from SHP-1-deficient mice, we showed that STAT1 inactivation was independent of PTP activity. However, inhibition of macrophage proteasome activity significantly rescued Leishmania-induced STAT1α degradation. We further demonstrated that degradation was receptor-mediated and involved protein kinase Cα. All Leishmania species tested (L. major, L. donovani, L. mexicana, L. braziliensis), but not the related parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, caused STAT1α degradation. Collectively, results from this study revealed a new mechanism for STAT1 regulation by a microbial pathogen, which favors its establishment and propagation within the host. Activation of the Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT1α signaling pathway is repressed in Leishmania-infected macrophages. This represents an important mechanism by which this parasite subverts the microbicidal functions of the cell to promote its own survival and propagation.

Intracellular protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus are the etiological agents of leishmaniasis, a condition that causes considerable worldwide morbidity and mortality, with pathologies ranging from disfiguring cutaneous to lethal visceral afflictions (1Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). Survival of these pathogens within the phagocytic cells of the host requires rapid alteration of macrophage signal transduction, resulting in abnormal immune functions (reviewed in Refs. 2Mansfield J.M.

Manipulation of these signaling pathways distorts the activities of transcription factors, such as STAT1α, which is important for the expression of IFNγ-induced genes, such as inducible nitric-oxide synthase and major histocompatibility complex class II (12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the unresponsiveness of the JAK2 signaling pathway in Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages upon IFNγ stimulation was due to the ability of the parasite to activate a particular protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), SHP-1 (4Blanchette J. Racette N. Faure R. Siminovitch K.A. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is a known inhibitor of several tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways, including the JAK2/STAT1α pathway, where it dephosphorylates JAK2 (4Blanchette J. Racette N. Faure R. Siminovitch K.A.

However, our observation that IFNγ-stimulated STAT1α activity is also reduced in SHP-1-deficient macrophages following L. donovani infection indicates that Leishmania employs further mechanisms to inhibit STAT1 activity. 2G. Forget, D. J. Gregory, and M. Olivier, manuscript submitted. Aside from SHP-1, numerous physiological and pathogen-induced proteins have been shown to regulate JAK/STAT pathways (15Wormald S. Hilton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Indeed, alternative splicing of the STAT1 mRNA itself produces a dominant negative variant, STAT1β, which binds the same promoter elements as STAT1α but lacks a crucial transcription activation domain (16Bromberg J.F.

The intracellular bacterium Mycobacterium avium appears to induce STAT1β to inhibit macrophage STAT1α activity (18Alvarez G.R. Zwilling B.S. Lafuse W.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6766-6773Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of proteins are induced by stimulation with various cytokines and provide negative feedback to the response of the cell to cytokine treatment (19Johnston J.A.

SOCS proteins are capable of acting as ubiquitin ligases, and inhibition of signaling by proteasome-mediated receptor degradation has been proposed to contribute to inactivation of various STATs (21Callus B.A. Mathey-Prevot B.

Although IFNγ-activated STAT1 has been shown to be ubiquitinated and protein levels have been stabilized by inhibitors of the proteasome, details of this mechanism and whether the SOCS family is involved have not been determined (28Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). SOCS family members have also been reported to prevent STAT phosphorylation by binding upstream receptors and preventing autophosphorylation or by competing for STAT binding (29Endo T.A. Masuhara M.

Viruses have developed a wide range of mechanisms for inhibiting IFNγ signaling, including production of decoy receptors and dominant negative intermediates (32Gotoh B. Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Yokoo J. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 337-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, paramyxovirus-encoded proteins have been shown to cause specific degradation of STAT1 by the proteasome by recruiting a cellular E3-ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (33Garcin D. Marq J.B. Iseni F. Martin S. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8799-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Didcock L. Young D.F. Goodbourn S. Randall R.E. J.

However, other groups have reported that this degradation is cell-type-specific and suggested that inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation is a more important mechanism (32Gotoh B. Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Yokoo J. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 337-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 36Komatsu T. Takeuchi K. Yokoo J. Tanaka Y. Gotoh B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2477-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no microbial pathogen has been reported to repress STAT1α by proteasome-mediated degradation. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms whereby Leishmania infection causes macrophage STAT1α inactivation. Our results show that abnormal STAT1α nuclear translocation in Leishmania-infected macrophages could be the consequence of rapid and sustained STAT1α protein diminution and that this may contribute to the lack of response to IFNγ. The depletion was shown to be specific to STAT1α, as STAT3 levels were unchanged, and was triggered by the early interaction between the pathogen and host cell. Our study further implicates protein kinase Cα (PKCα)-dependent signaling and proteasomes (but not PTPs) in this process. Together, these results argue for a direct role of the proteasome pathway in the specific proteolysis of STAT1α in macrophages infected by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, representing a new mechanism whereby microbial pathogens can subvert microbicidal activity.

Ross D.C. Adams P.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). When inhibitors were used or receptors were blocked by antibodies, cells were pre-treated 1 h before infection. Blocking antibodies to mouse CD11b (integrin αM chain, MAC-1α chain; α-CR3) and CD16/CD32 (FcγIII/II receptor; α-FcγR) were purchased from Pharmingen, and α-mannose receptor antibody (anti-PAM-1, ascites, IgG1) (42Biondi A. Rossing T.H. Bennett J. Todd III, R.F. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Paola Allavena (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy). The cells were first infected for 6 h, washed three times, then left to rest for 2 h before the addition of IFNγ (100 units/ml). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and Western Blotting—These were performed as described previously (43Jaramillo M. Godbout M. Olivier M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequence for EMSA (GAS/ISRE consensus) was 5′-AAG-TAC-TTT-CAG-TTT-CAT-ATT-ACT-CTA-3′. α-Phosphotyrosine-STAT1α and α-phosphotyrosine-STAT3 were a kind donation from Dr. David Frank (Dana Farber Institute). α-STAT1α and α-STAT3 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, α-phospho-PKCα from Cell Signaling Technologies, and α-PKCα from BD Transduction Laboratories (catalogue numbers sc-591, sc-483, 2261, and 610107, respectively). All experiments are representative of three. Immunofluorescence Staining—Experiments were performed in chamber slides. Cells (1 × 105) were gently washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 200 μl of methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. The slides were blocked with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% bovine serum albumin and then treated with 100 μl of anti-STAT1α in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature in a humid, dark chamber, washed three times, and then treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After the final washes, cover-slips were mounted on the chamber slides using 90% glycerol, 10% phosphate-buffered saline, and 2.5% DABCO (1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)octane). Pictures were taken using an immunofluorescence microscope at 400× magnification. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—After infection, 5 × 106 cells were washed and lysed in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). STAT1α-containing complexes were precipitated with 1 μg of α-STAT1α overnight at 4 °C and AG plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, all at 4 °C on a rotating platform. Immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer, and the remaining bead complexes were eluted in 45 μl of 2D rehydration buffer (40 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Isoelectric focusing was performed using the IPGPhor isoelectric focusing system 18-cm Immobiline immobilized pH gradient strips, pH 3-10 (Amersham Biosciences), according to manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Vorum silver staining. Effect of L. donovani Infection on STAT1α Nuclear Localization—Previous studies have reported that JAK2/STAT1 signaling is altered in Leishmania-infected macrophages (4Blanchette J. Racette N. Faure R. Siminovitch K.A. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Nandan D. Reiner N.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation was shown to be inhibited, the effect on STAT1α activity has not been reported. We therefore first established whether STAT1 activation by IFNγ stimulation was affected in Leishmania-infected macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1, EMSA allowed us to observe increased nuclear STAT1 DNA binding activity in response to IFNγ. However, this induction was prevented in Leishmania-infected macrophages. Interestingly, the STAT1 nuclear signal in non-stimulated macrophages was substantially diminished in infected cells in comparison to uninfected ones. It was important to determine the time frame in which this STAT1 down-regulation occurred. As indicated in Fig. 2A, STAT1 nuclear signal faded rapidly in L. donovani-infected cells in the absence of IFNγ, and was almost completely undetected 6 h post-infection. This contrasted with IFNγ treatment of uninfected cells, which resulted in a significant, time-dependent increase in STAT1 translocation. Lower nuclear levels of STAT1 during infection could result from its retention in the cytoplasm, for example, due to a failure to phosphorylate tyrosine 701. It could also reflect a reduction in total cellular STAT1 protein. To address these two possibilities, we monitored STAT1α protein level as well as its phosphorylation on residue Tyr-701 in whole cell lysates. Consistent with the EMSA, we observed that Leishmania infection, unlike IFNγ stimulation, did not lead to STAT1α Tyr-701 residue phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Importantly, we noticed that STAT1α protein levels decreased rapidly in the presence of Leishmania and in some cases disappeared completely by the third hour of infection. This observation permitted us to conclude that Leishmania-mediated STAT1α degradation is responsible for the absence of STAT1 from the nucleus. Of utmost interest, it appeared that this phenomenon was specific to STAT1α, because STAT3 protein level was unchanged by L. donovani infection. Disappearance of STAT1α from the nucleus was further reinforced by microscopic observation using immunofluorescence staining. Cells were infected with Leishmania or treated with IFNγ (100 units/ml; positive control for STAT1α activation) for 30 min. STAT1α protein seemed equally distributed in resting macrophages (Fig. 3, top left panel). As expected, IFNγ stimulation led to clustering of STAT1α in the nucleus (Fig. 3, top right panel). Importantly, in Leishmania-infected macrophages (Fig. 3, bottom left panel), a different pattern was revealed in that nuclear STAT1α was less abundant with diffuse localization in the cytoplasm, suggesting that STAT1α degradation may start in the nucleus. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases and SHP-1 Are Not Involved in STAT1α Inactivation—Many studies have reported evidence for a role for PTPs in STAT1 regulation (21Callus B.A. Mathey-Prevot B. Blood. 1998; 91: 3182-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25Yu C.L.

A. 1999; 96: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). As we have previously shown, Leishmania infection leads to PTP and SHP-1 activation (4Blanchette J. Racette N. Faure R. Siminovitch K.A. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Forget G. Siminovitch K.A. Brochu S. Rivest S. Radzioch D. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 40Olivier M. Romero-Gallo B.J. Matte C. Blanchette J. Posner B.I. Tremblay M.J. Faure R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13944-13949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It was legitimate to test whether the STAT1α inactivation seen here was dependent upon these molecules. As shown in Fig. 4A, our results demonstrated that inhibition of PTPs by bpV(phen) did not prevent the rapid disappearance of STAT1 triggered by Leishmania infection. In addition, we further demonstrated that the PTP SHP-1 is not involved in STAT1α inactivation by comparing immortalized macrophages from motheaten (SHP-1-/-) mice with their wild-type equivalents (37Forget G. Siminovitch K.A. Brochu S. Rivest S. Radzioch D. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3185-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4B, the pattern of STAT1 nuclear degradation was similar between wild-type and SHP-1-deficient cells, except for the basal translocation in resting cells. Indeed, the STAT1 signal was stronger in the absence of SHP-1. This is consistent with the fact that SHP-1 is known to regulate JAK2 phosphorylation (13Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Thus, in its absence, higher JAK2 activity increases STAT1 nuclear translocation. STAT1α Is Degraded via the Proteasome Pathway—Because STAT1α proteins apparently underwent proteolysis during Leishmania infection, we addressed the role of proteasomes in this process. Macrophages were treated with increasing doses of MG-132 and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (c-lactacystin), a more specific proteasome inhibitor, before infection with Leishmania. As seen in EMSA experiments in Fig. 5A, STAT1 reappeared in the nucleus when MG-132 and c-lactacystin were used. Moreover, these inhibitors also restored STAT1α protein level in whole cell lysates during infection (Fig. 5B). These results allowed us to conclude that, in the case of Leishmania infection, STAT1α is degraded via the proteasome. Implication of Different Leishmania Species and Macrophage Receptors in STAT1α Inactivation—The present study has demonstrated so far that infection of macrophages with L. donovani causes STAT1α inactivation by proteasomal degradation. It was important to verify whether other Leishmania species or other protozoan pathogens had the same ability. As seen in Fig. 6, A and B, all tested Leishmania species (L. donovani, L. major, L. mexicana, and L. braziliensis) caused STAT1α degradation. However, T. cruzi, a protozoan of the same Trypanosomatidae family as Leishmania, had no effect on STAT1. Moreover, phagocytosis of the malaria pigment hemozoin by macrophages had no effect either. Thus, the interaction of Leishmania species with the macrophages specifically affects STAT1α degradation and cannot be generalized to other similar pathogen/macrophage interactions or other forms of phagocytosis. The degradation that we observed started as early as 30 min after parasite contact, an insufficient time for parasite internalization. We therefore asked whether macrophage receptors previously implicated in Leishmania/macrophage interactions had a role to play in STAT1α inactivation. Proteasomal targeting of STAT1α could hence be triggered by receptor signaling. Several receptors, such as the complement receptor 3 (CR3), the receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins γ (FcγR), and the mannose-fucose receptor (mannose R) are known to bind Leishmania (45Mosser D.M. Edelson P.J. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2785-2789PubMed Google Scholar, 46Mosser D.M. Vlassara H. Edelson P.J. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 47Mosser D.M. Rosenthal L.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using blocking antibodies against these three receptors, we inhibited their ligation to Leishmania and observed the effects on STAT1 nuclear translocation. Results suggested that all three had a potential role to play in STAT1 inactivation (Fig. 6C), because the translocation of STAT1 was restored when receptors were blocked before infection, although the effect of blocking the mannose-fucose receptor was partial. The two most abundant parasite surface molecules that can bind to these receptors are the lipophosphoglycan and the surface protease gp63 (47Mosser D.M. Rosenthal L.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We investigated whether they could be implicated in STAT1α inactivation by using knock-out Leishmania parasites for each molecule. Surprisingly, neither molecule seemed to alter STAT1 nuclear translocation (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility of redundancy between lipophosphoglycan and gp63. The PKCα-dependent Pathway Is Involved in STAT1α Inhibition—Because results showed that triggering of macrophage receptors has a role to play in STAT1α degradation, we investigated whether downstream signaling was induced following receptor binding. One second messenger that is activated by both CR3 and FcγR binding is the protein kinase Cα (PKCα) (48Newman S.L. Mikus L.K. Tucci M.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 967-974PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a previous report linked PKCα to activation of proteasome-dependent pathways leading to STAT3 degradation (49Malek R.L. Halvorsen S.W.

As seen in Fig. 7A, interaction between Leishmania and macrophages for as little as 10 min provoked phosphorylation of PKCα, which was maintained for at least 1 h after infection. To assess whether PKCα activation in Leishmania-infected cells induced STAT1α degradation by the proteasome, we treated macrophages with increasing doses of a PKC inhibitor (Gö6976, IC50, 3 nm for PKCα). As seen in Fig. 7B, inhibition of PKCα significantly restored STAT1 nuclear translocation in infected macrophages. Thus, PKCα-dependent signaling seems to lead to STAT1α targeting to the proteasome in Leishmania-infected macrophages. Identification of Proteins That Target STAT1α to the Proteasome during Leishmania Infection—To identify which factors bind to STAT1α and target it to the proteasome pathway, we used a proteomic approach using two-dimensional electrophoresis of STAT1α immunoprecipitates. Fig. 8 shows that there were different spot patterns between uninfected and infected cells (top left versus top right panels). Indeed, many proteins either appeared or seemed up-regulated during Leishmania infection, whereas some others showed changed phosphorylation or disappeared. Of interest, we observed that almost no proteins were detected at 3 h post-infection. This is consistent with the fact that STAT1α is almost entirely degraded by this time and, thus, immunoprecipitation could not take place. Leishmania is known for its ability to down-regulate numerous macrophage functions that are detrimental to its survival and persistence (3Olivier M. Gregory D.J. Forget G. Clin. Microbiol.

Thus, the parasite has evolved ways to inhibit the different signaling pathways activated by such stimulation, namely the JAK2/STAT1α and mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 pathways (4Blanchette J.

We previously showed in vitro that oxidizing intermediates generated by phagocytes inactivate MMPs by modifying specific amino acids. To assess whether this mechanism operates in vivo, we focused on MMP-12, a macrophage-specific MMP known to mediate emphysema in mouse models. We found that mice lacking gp91phox, a phagocyte-specific component of the NADPH oxidase, developed extensive, spontaneous emphysematous destruction of their peripheral air spaces, whereas mice deficient in both NADPH oxidase and MMP-12 were protected from spontaneous emphysema. Although gp91phox-null and wild-type macrophages produced equivalent levels of MMP-12 protein, the oxidant-deficient cells had greater MMP-12 activity than wild-type macrophages. These findings indicate that reactive intermediates provide a physiological mechanism to protect tissues from excessive macrophage-mediated damage during inflammation.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. comprise a family of 25 distinct vertebrate gene products, of which 24 are found in mammals (1McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). As well as being involved in the turnover of extracellular matrix, MMPs regulate the activities of numerous effector proteins involved in inflammation and immunity (1McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 2Parks W.C. Shapiro S.D. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The net activity of MMPs is governed, to a large extent, by modulation of gene expression, zymogen activation, and enzyme inactivation. If the balance between enzyme activation (the sum of synthesis and zymogen activation) and inactivation is perturbed, excessive proteolysis may occur. In such situations, natural substrates can be exhausted, leading to misguided and potentially detrimental proteolysis of other proteins. Indeed, overexpression of specific MMPs or an excess of MMP-producing cells in mice and humans associates with a wide range of destructive diseases (1McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 3Parks W.C. Wilson C.L. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Nat. Rev.

Thus, understanding how leukocytes govern MMP-mediated proteolysis should identify fundamental regulatory mechanisms of inflammation.Inhibition of MMP activity has generally been attributed to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), α2-macroglobulin, and other proteins (1McCawley L.J.

For example, although they are effective inhibitors in vitro, the most clearly demonstrated in vivo functions of TIMPs include activation of MMP activity (8Caterina J.J. Yamada S. Caterina N.C.

Analogous to serpins, protein inhibitors of serine proteinases, TIMPs may neutralize active MMPs that have escaped the pericellular environment. To fine-tune cell-directed proteolysis, leukocytes may rely on intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms.Macrophages use a membrane-associated NADPH oxidase to generate an array of oxidizing intermediates (13Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrated that oxidants potently and efficiently inactivate matrilysin (MMP-7) by cross-linking adjacent tryptophan-glycine residues within the catalytic domain of the enzyme (14Fu X.

These in vitro observations suggest that MMP inactivation can occur on or near phagocytes that produce both MMPs and reactive intermediates. In the absence of reactive intermediates, unrestrained proteolytic activity might lead to detrimental tissue damage. Indeed, inherited deficiency of gp91phox, a phagocyte-specific component of the NADPH oxidase required for oxidant production, and targeted deletion of its mouse homologue result in granuloma formation and excessive tissue destruction (16Morgenstern D.E.

Aberrant regulation of MMP activity may contribute to the damage that occurs when phagocytes are unable to generate oxidants.To determine whether oxidants regulate MMP activity in vivo, we focused on the role of macrophages in inflammatory lung disease. Although human macrophages express a variety of MMPs, mouse macrophages predominately produce metalloelastase (MMP-12), along with relatively lower levels of gelatinase-B (MMP-9) (19Filippov S. Caras I. Murray R. Matrisian L.M. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S. Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activity of MMP-12, which is produced only by macrophages, is required for the progression of lung damage in a murine model of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema (20Hautamaki R.D. Kobayashi D.K. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that phagocyte-derived oxidizing intermediates might regulate the activity of MMP-12 in vivo. In the current studies, we have demonstrated that oxidants do indeed inactivate MMP-12. Surprisingly, we also discovered that gp91phox mutant mice develop spontaneous, progressive emphysema, equal to that seen in smoke-exposed wild-type animals. Consistent with our idea that oxidants play a physiological role in controlling MMP proteolysis, we saw no spontaneous lung damage in mice deficient in both gp91phox and MMP-12. Our findings indicate that oxidants may function to govern, rather than promote, inflammatory processes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—Both gp91phox–/– mice (21Pollock J.D. Williams D.A. Gifford M.A. Li L.L. Du X. Fisherman J. Orkin S.H. Doerschuk C.M. Dinauer M.C. Nat.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) were in a C57Bl/6J background and had been outcrossed and then intercrossed for three generations to generate animals deficient in both genes. In preliminary studies, mice were exposed to the smoke of two research-grade cigarettes per day, 6 days/week for 1–6 months as described (20Hautamaki R.D. Kobayashi D.K. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Mice were killed with CO2, and their lungs were fixed and processed as described (23Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Sections were stained for MMP-12 (20Hautamaki R.D. Kobayashi D.K. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar) or with a Mac3 antibody (BD Biosciences) using a Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Mac3-postive macrophages were counted in 10 randomly chosen areas of sections from each of 3 different animals under ×100 magnification and with a 10 × 10 grid superimposed on the image.Morphometry—We examined hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections in a blinded manner at ×50 corrected magnification. For each time point, 10 areas from sections of 6–12 mice were selected, and the digital images were analyzed using Scion Image and a lung morphometry protocol generated by Dr. Steven Boukedes (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). Data were averaged to provide mean chord length and mean alveolar area (20Hautamaki R.D. Kobayashi D.K. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 24Dunnill M.S. Thorax. 1962; 17: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Average airspace area was calculated by dividing the total airspace by the total number of alveoli using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA).Invasion Assay—Macrophages were harvested by peritoneal lavage 5 days after intraperitoneal injection of 4% thioglycolate (21Pollock J.D. Williams D.A. Gifford M.A. Li L.L. Du X. Fisherman J. Orkin S.H. Doerschuk C.M. Dinauer M.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation, and red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis. Cells (>95% macrophages) were plated on Matrigel-coated inserts (BD Biosciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum and 0.1 μg/ml GM-CSF (22Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The inserts were placed in tissue culture wells with or without 5 ng/ml of recombinant mouse JE (MCP-1/CCL2; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in the bottom well and with or without 25 μm GM6001 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) in the upper well. After 72 h, noninvading cells were scraped from the upper surface of the filters, which were then fixed and stained. The number of macrophages that had invaded to the bottom surface of the filters was counted in 10 high power fields (×40 magnification).MMP-12 Activity and Expression Assays—The catalytic domain of recombinant human MMP-12 (100 nm; BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was exposed to reactive intermediates generated by 100 μm xanthine and 24 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase (Roche Diagnostics) (25Savenkova M.L. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20394-20400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, the reaction was supplemented with 12 units/ml catalase, 125 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and/or 25 nm myeloperoxidase (±500 μm nitrite, 150 mm NaCl, 16 mm NaN3). MMP-12 was diluted to 5 nm in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2% NaN3, 0.05% Brij-35, and its activity was determined in a fluorometric assay using Mca peptide (7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-pro-leu-gly-leu-β-(2,4-dinitrophenylamino)ala-ala-arg-NH2; Sigma) (26Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar).The Mca peptide was also used in an MMP-12 fluorescent assay kit (BioMol) to measure MMP activity in isolated macrophage lysates. Peritoneal macrophages (5 × 106) were lysed in 500 NL of 10 mm Tris buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaN3, 50 μm β-hydroxytoluene, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged to remove cell debris. MMP activity was measured as above, diluting the sample to remove effects of protease inhibitors. Protein levels were estimated by immunoblotting. Total protein was separated through a 4–12% polyacrylamide gel using MOPS running buffer (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris, 3.5 mm SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). MMP-12 was detected by immunoblotting using an antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Peritoneal macrophages were also used for RNA isolation and Northern hybridization or were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented/10% calf serum for 24 h. MMP-12 activity in the conditioned medium was detected by immunoblotting and by substrate zymography (4–16% prestained Blue Casein Zymogram gel; Invitrogen) (22Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar).Cytokine Measurements—Lungs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in water supplemented with protease inhibitors. Following the addition of cytokine lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cytokine levels in the supernatants were quantified using the Luminex 100 protein analysis system (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) (27de Jager W. te Velthuis H. Prakken B.J. Kuis W. Rijkers G.T. Clin. Diagn. Lab Immunol. 2003; 10: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).Statistical Procedures—Results represent means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using the unpaired Student's t test, assuming unequal variance, and one-way analysis of variance, using either Tukey's or Dunnett's multiple comparison post-test (Prism 4; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p values <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSNADPH oxidase reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide, which dismutates to yield hydrogen peroxide. This oxidant is made more reactive by myeloperoxidase, a heme protein secreted by phagocytes that converts peroxide to hypochlorous acid and reactive nitrogen species (28Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 707-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). To assess whether any of these reactive intermediates can directly affect MMP-12 activity, we incubated purified, active enzyme with xanthine and xanthine oxidase, a model system that produces superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (25Savenkova M.L. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20394-20400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This system inhibited the proteolytic activity of MMP-12 by ∼40% (Fig. 1). The peroxide scavenger catalase and the superoxide scavenger superoxide dismutase blocked inactivation of the proteinase. MMP-12 was inhibited ∼90 and ∼60% when myeloperoxidase and chloride or myeloperoxidase and nitrite were included in the system. The heme poison azide blocked inhibition by the myeloperoxidase system, indicating that an active peroxidase was required to inactivate the MMP. These observations demonstrate that reactive intermediates derived from the NADPH oxidase can inactivate MMP-12 in vitro.Based on these in vitro studies, we hypothesized that oxidizing intermediates act on MMP-12 to inhibit its activity. Thus, in the absence of NADPH oxidase and, in turn, the resulting oxidants, the proteolytic activity of MMP-12 should be greater than in oxidant-producing macrophages. To test this idea, we assessed whether net pericellular proteolysis is enhanced in gp91phox–/– phagocytes by measuring the ability of peritoneal macrophages to migrate through Matrigel. Macrophages from gp91phox–/– mice were significantly more invasive than macrophages from wild-type mice (Fig. 2a). Moreover, GM6001, a broad-acting inhibitor of metalloproteinase activity, reduced the invasiveness of gp91phox–/– macrophages to wild-type levels (Fig. 2a). Thus, the enhanced invasiveness of gp91phox–/– macrophages requires the activity of a metalloproteinase.Fig. 2Enhanced invasion and MMP-12 activity of macrophages from NADPH oxidase-deficient mice. a, peritoneal macrophages were plated on Matrigel-coated membranes in medium with or without GM6001, a broad-acting metalloproteinase inhibitor, and the number of cells that invaded the matrix barrier was quantified. Results were normalized to the number of invaded gp91phox+/+ macrophages and represent the mean cell number ± S.E. of two to five individual experiments with two to three determinations per analysis. *, p <0.05; **, p <0.001. b, peritoneal macrophages from gp91phox+/+ were lysed, and total protein was quantified. Equal amounts of protein (260 or 520 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis, and MMP-12 (arrow) was detected by immunoblotting. c, total MMP activity was quantified using a fluorogenic substrate. Data shown are the mean ± S.E. for assays from four different macrophage preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because macrophages use MMP-12 to migrate through Matrigel, (22Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) we used cells from double knock-out (gp91phox–/–, mp12–/–) mice to determine whether the enhanced invasiveness of gp91phox–/– macrophages was due to increased MMP-12 activity. Macrophages from double mutants were markedly less invasive than macrophages from mice deficient in only NADPH oxidase (gp91phox–/–,mp12+/+) (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the invasive activity of double mutant macrophages was essentially the same as for wild-type or gp91phox–/– single knock-out cells in the presence of GM6001.The increased invasive activity of gp91phox–/– macrophages could be due to higher MMP-12 expression per cell or greater net MMP-12 activity with no relative change in protein level. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured MMP-12 mRNA and protein levels in isolated macrophages. Relative levels of MMP-12 protein, normalized to cell number, in conditioned medium (data not shown) or cell lysates (Fig. 2b) and steady-state mRNA levels (data not shown) were essentially the same in macrophages from wild-type or gp91phox–/– mice. In contrast, MMP-12 activity in conditioned medium (data not shown) and cell lysates was 3-fold higher in macrophages from gp91phox–/– mice than in wild-type (gp91phox+/+) macrophages (Fig. 2c). These findings suggest that increased MMP-12 activity, not production, led to the enhanced ability of gp91phox–/– macrophages to migrate through a Matrigel barrier.To assess whether reactive intermediates regulate MMP activity in vivo, we planned to examine the extent of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in gp91phox–/– mice. Much to our surprise, we found that the peripheral air spaces of 3–6-month-old air-breathing control gp91phox–/– mice had enlarged spontaneously (Fig. 3, a and b). Unlike other gene-targeted mice that develop early onset, spontaneous alveolar enlargement (29Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A.

Nature. 2003; 422: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), defective organogenesis did not lead to the emphysema in gp91phox–/– mice. When they reached 3 months of age, their lung architecture was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice (Fig. 3c). By 6 months of age, however, the gp91phox–/– mice began to lose alveoli and alveolar ducts, and these changes progressed with age. By 12 months, the air spaces in all gp91phox–/– mice examined were markedly enlarged and clearly emphysematous (Fig. 3, b and c). In fact, we could accurately deduce the genotype of these otherwise apparently normal mice from their lung phenotype. At 12 months, the average air space in gp91phox–/– lungs was significantly greater (p = 0.0095) than in wild-type lungs (Fig. 3c). The nearly 2-fold difference was similar, if not slightly greater than, the emphysematous damage seen in wild-type mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months (20Hautamaki R.D. Kobayashi D.K. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Mice deficient in NADPH oxidase develop progressive, spontaneous emphysema. a and b, histological sections (×10 magnification) of lungs from 12-month-old gp91phox+/+ and gp91phox–/– mice. c and d, morphometric analysis of average air space area ± S.E.

Compared with wild-type mice, lungs of gp91phox–/– mice had more leukocytes (Fig. 3b). As determined by staining with Mac3, most of these cells were macrophages. In 3-month-old gp91phox–/– mice, the number of macrophages in lungs was only 1.4-fold higher than in wild-type mice, but at 12 months there was an ∼3-fold increase (Fig. 3d). However, lungs of gp91phox–/– mice showed no histological evidence of infection, such as neutrophil infiltration or abscess formation. Thus, the increased number of macrophages likely resulted from an impairment of cell-mediated processes rather than from an opportunistic infection. We cannot exclude the possibility that the increase in macrophages may have been due to a persistent, low-level infection, but the lack of neutrophils argues against this suggestion.MMP-12, a macrophage-specific MMP, mediates the development of smoke-induced emphysema in mice (20Hautamaki R.D. Kobayashi D.K. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. Science. 1997; 277: 2002-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). To assess whether MMP-12 was responsible for the lung destruction seen in mice lacking gp91phox, we generated mice deficient in both NADPH oxidase and MMP-12 (gp91phox–/–,mmp12–/–). Like either of the single knock-outs, the double mutants were healthy and reproduced normally. Also, their peripheral airways (Fig. 4, e and f) were identical to those in age-matched wild-type mice at 6 and 12 months of age (Fig. 2, a and b). In contrast, the alveolar spaces were markedly enlarged in mice deficient in NADPH oxidase alone (gp91phox–/–,mmp12+/+) (Fig. 4, c and d, and Fig. 5, a and b).Fig. 4Lack of spontaneous emphysema in mice deficient for both NADPH oxidase and MMP-12. Lung sections (×20 magnification) of 9–12-month-old gp91phox+/+,mmp12+/+ mice, gp91phox–/–,mmp12+/+ mice, and gp91phox–/–,mmp12–/– mice were immunostained with Mac3 for macrophages (a, c, e) or for MMP-12 (b, d, f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Protection from emphysema in the presence of elevated macrophage numbers in lungs of mice deficient in NADPH oxidase and MMP-12.

Although lungs of gp91phox–/–,mmp12–/– mice also contained more macrophages than age-matched wild-type mice, they had only 33% fewer cells than the lungs of NADPH oxidase-deficient (gp91phox–/–,mmp12+/+) mice (Figs. 4 and 5c). Despite this slight reduction in macrophage influx, double mutants showed marked protection against the development of emphysema, with morphometric values that did not differ significantly from wild-type values (Fig. 5, a and c). These data indicate that the damage seen in gp91phox–/– mice was more dependent on the presence of MMP-12 than on macrophage number.To explore potential causes for the increased macrophage influx seen in the gp91phox–/– lungs, we measured levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines (Table I). Macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2/CXCL2) was undetectable in wild-type lungs, but high levels were detectable in lungs of gp91phox–/– and double mutant (gp91phox–/–,mmp12–/–) mice. In contrast, interleukin-6 and KC/CXCL1 were detected in lungs of wild-type animals, and levels of both factors were modestly higher in lungs of both mutant strains. Thus, whereas MMP-12 deficiency almost completely protected the NADPH oxidase-deficient mice from emphysema, the lack of this proteinase only partially prevented macrophage accumulation in lungs and did not reduce the higher levels of MIP-2, interleukin-6, or KC associated with gp91phox deficiency.Table IIncreased levels of inflammatory mediators in NADPH oxidase-null miceGenotypeFactor (pg/ml)gp91phox+/+,mmp12+/+gp91phox-/-,mmp12+/+gp91phox-/-,mmp12-/-MIP-2<1439.3 ± 7.3**38.7 ± 12.0**Interleukin-618.9 ± 0.923.8 ± 1.4*22.1 ± 3.1*KC30.7 ± 1.234.0 ± 0.9*35.3 ± 3.5 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONOur data indicate that pericellular production of oxidants by phagocytes controls proteolysis by MMPs in vivo. We observed excessive lung destruction in mice deficient in phagocyte NADPH oxidase (gp91phox–/–). Because smoke-induced emphysema in mice requires the activity of MMP-12 and because we observed emphysema in gp91phox–/– mice in the absence of an initiating insult (i.e. cigarette smoke), we conclude that macrophage-derived oxidants govern pericellular proteolysis by these cells. The likely mechanism involves direct inactivation of catalytically active MMP-12 by reactive intermediates, as demonstrated in our in vitro experiments.Macrophages and neutrophils use membrane-associated NADPH oxidase to generate reactive oxygen intermediates (13Babior B.M.

Double disruption of speB and speE (polyamine aminopropyltransferase) resulted in the disappearance of N1-aminopropylagmatine and the accumulation of agmatine. These results suggested the following. 1) N1-Aminopropylagmatine is produced from agmatine by the action of an enzyme coded by speE. 2) N1-Aminopropylagmatine is a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of unique polyamines found in the thermophile. 3) N1-Aminopropylagmatine is a substrate of the SpeB homolog. They further suggest a new biosynthetic pathway in T. thermophilus, by which polyamines are formed from agmatine via N1-aminopropylagmatine.

Polyamines play important roles in cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Common polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are distributed ubiquitously in cells and tissues at relatively high concentrations (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar, 2Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Thermus thermophilus, of which the genome project was completed using two strains, HB8 and HB27 (Structural-Biological Whole Cell Project at www.srg.harima.riken.go.jp/thermus/j_index.htm and see Ref. 3Henne A.

Heimer Y.M. The Physiology of Polyamines. 2. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 36-46Google Scholar) (see Fig. 9C). These long and branched polyamines have a marked effect of protecting and stabilizing nucleic acids (5Kirino H. Kuwahara R. Hamasaki N. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 6Terui Y. Ohnuma M. Hiraga K. Kawashima E. Oshima T. Biochem.

In many organisms, such as bacteria, yeast, animals, and plants, the first step of polyamine biosynthesis is production of putrescine by decarboxylation of l-ornithine (see Fig. 9A). An additional or alternative pathway of putrescine biosynthesis that is often seen in plants and sometimes in bacteria is decarboxylation of l-arginine followed by hydrolysis of agmatine. Agmatine ureohydrolase or agmatinase, coded by the speB gene, catalyzes this second reaction. The next step is production of spermidine and spermine by the addition of an aminopropyl group to putrescine and spermidine, respectively. This reaction is catalyzed by spermidine or spermine synthase (putrescine/spermidine aminopropyltransferase) coded by the speE gene (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). To investigate the polyamine biosynthetic pathway in T. thermophilus, we constructed a disruption strain of the speB gene homolog of T. thermophilus. Disruption of the speB gene homolog resulted in drastic reduction of triamines, longer and branched polyamines without accumulation of agmatine, and in accumulation of an unknown compound. Double disruption of speB and speE gene homologs resulted in disappearance of this compound and accumulation of agmatine in the cells. The new compound was identified as N1-aminopropylagmatine (N8-amidino-1,8-diamino-4-azaoctane, N8-amidinospermidine) by comparison with the chemically synthesized authentic compound. In vitro reactions revealed that SpeE is responsible for the production of N1-aminopropylagmatine, and SpeB converts N1-aminopropylagmatine to spermidine.

To make speB overexpression plasmid, PCR was carried out for 25 cycles (94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) with LA Taq in GC buffer using primers of sB5′NdeI and sB3′Hind (Table II). Each PCR product was digested with NdeI and HindIII and was cloned between the NdeI and HindIII site of expression plasmid pET21c+ to make pESE8 and pESB8, respectively. All cloned nucleotide sequences were determined to verify the fidelity of the amplified product to the original sequence using BigDye Terminator Ready Reaction Premix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencing System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To obtain speB and speE gene homolog disruption strains of T. thermophilus, the thermophile host was genetically transformed as described previously (11Takada T. Akanuma S. Kotsuka T. Tamakoshi M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 2737-2739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Koyama Y. Hoshino T. Tomizawa N. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 338-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All genetic recombinations were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Cells of T. thermophilus were collected from 250 ml of overnight culture (about A590 = 0.3–0.4) in minimum medium at 70 °C. 3-Fold volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to the collected cell paste, and the mixture was vortexed thoroughly to extract cellular polyamines. Appropriately diluted samples were analyzed to determine polyamine composition using a CK-10S column (8.0 × 70 mm, Mitsubishi Kasei) as described previously (17Oshima T. Method Enzymol. 1983; 94: 401-411Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All samples were subjected to GC and GC-MS analyses to confirm polyamine species, as described by Niitsu et al. (18Niitsu M. Samejima K. Matsuzaki S. Hamana K. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 641: 115-123Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP cells carrying pESE8 or pESB8 were grown in 10 liters of 2× YT medium at 37 °C. When apparent absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.3, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. For purification of SpeE, cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA followed by cell disruption with a sonic oscillator. After removing the cell debris by centrifugation (30,000 rpm, 20 min), the cell extract was heated for 15 min at 75 °C, and the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (30,000 rpm, 20 min). Heat treatment was repeated twice. The proteins precipitated by 50% saturated ammonium sulfate were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. Then the enzyme was further purified by a Hiprep QXL column (Amersham Biosciences) and by Resource HIC PHE column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatographies. SpeE thus obtained was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE and was stored at 4 °C as a suspension in 60% saturated ammonium sulfate in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) until use. For purification of SpeB, cells were corrected and suspended in 10 ml of SB buffer (100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm pyridoxal phosphate, and 1 mm agmatine) and were disrupted by sonication. After removing the cell debris by centrifugation (30,000 rpm, 20 min), the cell extract was heated for 15 min at 75 °C, and the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (30,000 rpm, 20 min). Heat treatment was repeated twice. The supernatant was fractionated by 30–50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate collected by centrifugation was suspended in SB buffer. The enzyme was further purified by Hiprep QXL (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography. Partially purified SpeB was stored at 4 °C as a suspension in 60% saturated ammonium sulfate in SB buffer (pH 7.0) until use. Protein concentrations were estimated with BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To determine Km and kcat of SpeE, the aminopropyltransferase assay was performed as described in literature (19Raina A. Eloranta T. Pajula R. Method Enzymol. 1983; 94: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), except pH was 9.0 and agmatine was used as substrate instead of putrescine. The methyl-14C-labeled decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) was synthesized by the method of Samejima. 2K. Samejima, unpublished data. To confirm the reaction product of SpeE, a reaction mixture consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 37 °C), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm agmatine, 337.5 μm dcSAM, and 32 μg of purified SpeE in a final volume of 2 ml was incubated at 37 °C overnight. Polyamines were isolated by using Dowex 50W-X4 (Muromachi Technos Co. Ltd.) column chromatography. Fractions containing polyamines that react with o-phthalaldehyde were collected and concentrated. For identification of the chemical reaction catalyzed by SpeB, a reaction mixture consisting of 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 50 μg of partially purified SpeB, and 40 μg of dried reaction product of SpeE described above or 50 μg of chemically synthesized N1-aminopropylagmatine in a final volume of 50 μl was incubated at 65 °C for 1 h. In another experiment, 40 μg of agmatine was added instead of N1-aminopropylagmatine to investigate whether or not SpeB possesses agmatinase activity. The reaction product was analyzed by HPLC.

After removal of NaBr, the reaction product was washed with ether and dried. The residue was refluxed for 24 h with 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture was applied to a small column of Dowex 50W-X4 (H+ form) and eluted with 6 m hydrochloric acid. Fractions of 30 ml were collected and examined by analytical HPLC, and those containing the desired compound were combined and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at about 40 °C. A pale yellow oil was obtained (0.06 g, 77%). For 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ, the values were 1.69 (2H, m), 1.80 (2H, m), 2.13 (2H, m), 3.14 (6H, m), 3.25 (2H, t). For 13C NMR (75 MHz, D2O) δ, the values were 22.88, 23.78, 25.10, 36.60, 40.49, 44.52, 47.32, and 156.77. For high resolution mass spectrometry, the value calculated for C8H22N5 (M + H) was 188.1875, and the value found was 188.1886; the value calculated for C8H23N5 (M + 2H) was 189.1953, and the value found was 189.1953; the value calculated for C8H24N5 (M + 3H) was 190.2032, and the value found was 190.2007. To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of T. thermophilus, we searched for gene homologs of known polyamine biosynthetic enzymes in the T. thermophilus genome. Homologs of arginine decarboxylase (speA, the open reading frame numbers of T. thermophilus HB8 and HB27 (3Henne A. Bruggemann H. Raasch C. Wiezer A. Hartsch T. Liesegang H. Johann A. Lienard T.

Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the speB gene products is shown in Fig. 2. The amino acid sequence deduced from the T. thermophilus speB gene homolog showed 29–32% similarity to those of other organisms. The histidine residue that is critical for catalytic activity in the E. coli enzyme (22Carvajal N. Olate J. Salas M. López V. Cerpa J. Herrera P. Uribe E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the manganese ion-binding residues (23Perozich J. Hempel J. Morris Jr., S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) are conserved in all amino acid sequences examined. To ascertain whether polyamine synthesis starts from ornithine or arginine in the thermophile, we first disrupted the speB gene homolog of T. thermophilus. The disruption strain, named MOSB, was constructed by insertion of the HTK gene into the speB gene homolog of TTY1. When MOSB was cultivated in minimum medium at 70 °C, the disruption showed no effect on growth (doubling time of MOSB was 7.2 h while that of TTY1 was 4.9 h; see Fig. 3). Growth on a minimum medium plate at 75 °C also showed little difference between MOSB and TTY1 (data not shown). However, disruption of the speB gene homolog resulted in significant defect of growth at 78 °C in minimum medium (Table III). In addition, the MOSB colony was pale yellow, whereas the TTY1 colony exhibited a bright yellow color (data not shown).Table IIIEffect of temperature on growthStrain70 °C78 °CTTY11.080.74MOSB1.040.02MOSBE0.970.07 Open table in a new tab Intracellular polyamine composition of MOSB grown in minimum medium at 70 °C was analyzed by HPLC. Most polyamines found in the cells of TTY1 (Fig. 4A) fell below the limit of detection by our method in MOSB (Fig. 4B). At the same time, an unknown polyamine designated as polyamine A in Fig. 4 was accumulated. Cadaverine, agmatine, and two unknown polyamines (X and Y) were concomitantly detected as minor compounds. Fig. 5A shows the results of GC analysis of polyamines in MOSB. The major peak occurred at 9.3 min, and its molecular weight was estimated as 775 based on mass numbers of molecular fragments observed on the GC-MS spectrum shown in Fig. 5B. This corresponds to the molecular weight of N1-aminopropylagmatine bound to three heptafluorobutyryl molecules. Because the gene coding for aminopropyltransferase is present in MOSB, the major unknown polyamine of MOSB can be predicted to be N1-aminopropylagmatine. Two additional unknown polyamines (X and Y in Fig. 4B) could not be identified because their amounts were too small.Fig. 5GC and GC-MS analyses of polyamines in MOSB.

In HPLC analyses, the retention time of the synthesized N1-aminopropylagmatine was identical to that of polyamine A (data not shown). By having identified polyamine A as N1-aminopropylagmatine, we next disrupted the gene of polyamine aminopropyltransferase (speE homolog) of MOSB. To construct the speB and speE double-disruption strain, we disrupted the speB homolog by inserting the HTK gene of T. thermophilus (ΔspeE) whose speE homolog had been replaced with the pyrE gene. The double disruptant was named T. thermophilus MOSBE. MOSBE showed defective growth at 70 °C in minimum medium (doubling time was 12.8 h; see Fig. 3) and significantly defective growth at 78 °C (Table III). Like that of MOSB, the MOSBE colony was pale yellow (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, agmatine was accumulated in MOSBE cells, and N1-aminopropylagmatine, the major polyamine of MOSB, was drastically diminished. A small amount of cadaverine was detected, but other polyamines, especially long and branched polyamines, were undetectable. These results indicated that the major polyamine biosynthesis in T. thermophilus starts from arginine and not from ornithine. A new polyamine, N1-aminopropylagmatine, produced from agmatine by the speE gene homolog, plays a key role as a metabolic intermediate in polyamine biosynthesis in the thermophile. We therefore concluded that the T. thermophilus speB gene homolog codes for N1-aminopropylagmatine ureohydrolase, and the speE gene homolog codes for agmatine aminopropyltransferase. Although MOSB could not grow in minimum medium at 78 °C (Table III), the growth recovered when 250 μm spermidine was added to the medium. The polyamine composition of MOSB grown at 78 °C is shown in Fig. 7. A long polyamine, homocaldopentamine, was accumulated as the major component in these cells. A small amount of quaternary branched polyamine, tetrakis(3-aminopropyl)ammonium, was also present. N1-Aminopropylagmatine was not produced under these conditions, suggesting that the accumulation of long polyamines represses its production. The finding that MOSB produced long and branched polyamines in medium supplemented with spermidine suggests that conversion of N1-aminopropylagmatine to spermidine is an essential step in the synthesis of long and branched polyamines and that the speB gene product of T. thermophilus is responsible for the reaction. To confirm that SpeE converts agmatine to N1-aminopropylagmatine and that SpeB uses N1-aminopropylagmatine as a substrate to produce spermidine, we purified SpeE and partially purified SpeB to perform in vitro enzymatic reactions. A typical purification procedure of SpeE was summarized in Table IV. SpeE was recovered from the soluble fraction and purified by an anion exchange chromatography and a hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purity of SpeE by SDS-PAGE was shown in Fig. 8A. The purified SpeE migrated as a single band (36 kDa). The final preparation had a specific activity of 2.4 μmol/min/mg proteins, 51-fold that of the crude enzyme.Table IVPurification of SpeEStepTotal proteinSpecific activityTotal activityPurificationYieldmgnmol/min/mgμmol/min-fold%Cell-free extract474.646.822.211001st heat treatment53.1805.442.8171932nd heat treatment52.3836.943.818197Hiprep QXL16.61738.928.838130Resource HIC Phe9.72402.223.251105 Open table in a new tab The purified enzyme was significantly stable; little loss of activity was observed after storage at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 m ammonium sulfate for at least a year. The kinetic parameters of SpeE were determined by Hanes-Woolf plot. Because dcSAM decompose at high temperature under alkaline conditions (24Zappia V. Galletti P. Oliva A. de Santis A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), reactions for obtaining kinetic parameters were performed at 37 °C (pH 9) with various concentrations of agmatine (0.5–2 μm) and 38 μm dcSAM. The enzymatic reaction was performed in one tube, and 100 μl of reaction mixture was sampled to stop reaction at 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. The Km value for agmatine was 0.77 μm. The kcat was 0.37 s–1 when agmatine was used as substrate. The partially purified SpeB migrated as a single band (32.5 kDa) on a SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 8B. As shown in Fig. 8C, trace a, agmatine was converted to N1-aminopropylagmatine by purified SpeE. In addition, purified SpeB converted the reaction product of SpeE into spermidine in vitro (Fig. 8C, trace b). Chemically synthesized N1-aminopropylagmatine was also converted to spermidine by SpeB (see Fig. 8C, traces e and f). SpeB could not utilize agmatine as a substrate (Fig. 8C, traces c and d). These results confirmed that SpeE converts agmatine to N1-aminopropylagmatine, and SpeB converts N1-aminopropylagmatine to spermidine. T. thermophilus produces"

By using isolated brain mitochondria, we found that nicotine inhibited N-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+) and calcium-induced mitochondria high amplitude swelling and cytochrome c release from intact mitochondria. Intra-mitochondria redox state was also maintained by nicotine, which could be attributed to an attenuation of mitochondria permeability transition. Further investigation revealed that nicotine did not prevent MPP+- or calcium-induced mitochondria membrane potential loss, but instead decreased the electron leak at the site of respiratory chain complex I. In the presence of mecamylamine hydrochloride, a nonselective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inhibitor, nicotine significantly postponed mitochondria swelling and cytochrome c release induced by a mixture of neurotoxins (MPP+ and 6-hydroxydopamine) in SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that there is a receptor-independent nicotine-mediated neuroprotective effect of nicotine. These results show that interaction of nicotine with mitochondria respiratory chain together with its antioxidant effects should be considered in the neuroprotective effects of nicotine.

Although the mechanisms of neuroprotection by nicotine are not fully understood, and there are still some conflicting reports (4Behmand R.A. Harik S.I. J.

Movement Disorders. 2004; 19: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is accepted that nicotine usually acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) agonist. Although nigrostriatal damage reduces expression of specific nAChRs subtypes (6O'Neill M.J. Murray T.K. Lakics V. Visanji N.P. Duty S. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002; 1: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), stimulation of these receptors has been proved to be neuroprotective (7Newhouse P. Singh A. Potter A. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Besides its agonistic properties, nicotine has several receptor independent effects whereby it could protect neurons against toxins (8Quik M. Kulak J.M. Neurotoxicology. 2002; 23: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Linert et al. (9Linert W. Bridge M.H. Huber M. Bjugstad K.B. Grossman S. Arendash G.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Our previous work also indicated that nicotine acts as an effective reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger in the gas phase of cigarette smoking (10Liu Q. Tao Y. Zhao B.L. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2003; 24: 105-112Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, Cormier et al. (11Cormier A. Morin C. Zini R. Tillement J.P. Lagrue G. Brain Res. 2001; 900: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showed that nicotine was an effective NADH competitor that inhibited the mitochondria NADH-ubiquinone reductase (NQR) activity and significantly decreased brain mitochondrial respiratory control ratio. They also found that nicotine significantly decreased superoxide anion generation in brain mitochondria, suggesting a possible direct role of nicotine on mitochondria respiratory chain independent of its receptor.Complex I inhibition or deficiency is thought to play a major role in PD etiology (12Mizuno Y.

In addition, MPP+ loading triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria by inducing an apoptosis cascade that ultimately leads to programmed cell death, a phenomenon that involves the mitochondria permeability transition (mPT) (17Przedborski S.

Here we examined the effects of nicotine and MPP+ on mPT and cytochrome c release to illustrate a possible involvement of mitochondria in mediating the neuroprotective effect of nicotine. Mitochondria substrates for NQR were used to analyze the specific involvement of complex I. The Ca2+-induced mPT was also examined to display a universal effect of nicotine on mitochondria permeability transition. To illustrate if nicotine can penetrate the cell membrane and take effect independent of its receptor, mecamylamine, a nonselective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inhibitor, was applied in the SY5Y cell line. A plasmid containing cytochrome c tagged with green fluorescence protein (c-GFP) was transferred to the cell to trace cytochrome c under the confocal microscope, and the photogrammetry on mitochondria swelling was also taken in the presence of the fluorescent mitochondria red dye called Mitotracker Red CMXRos.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—(-)-Nicotine was obtained from Zhengzhou Tobacco Academy of China (Zhengzhou, China). Cytochrome c release apoptosis assay kit with mouse monoclonal cytochrome c antibody (reacts with denatured human, mouse, and rat cytochrome c) was purchased from Oncogene (San Diego); β-actin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cytochrome c-GFP plasmid was kindly provided by Prof. D. C. Chang (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and Lipofectamine 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen; luminol (3-aminophthalhydrazide) was from Arcos Organics (Geel, Belgium); lucigenin (bis-N-methylacridinium nitrate), horseradish peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were from bovine erythrocytes; mecamylamine hydrochloride, Mitotracker Red CMXRos, Ellman's reagent, bovine serum albumin, MPP+, CsA (cyclosporin A), glutamate, succinate, mannitol, and EDTA were from Sigma; malate and NADH were from Amresco (Solon, OH); and Percoll was from Amersham Biosciences.Cell Treatments and Confocal Microscope Photogrammetry—The photogrammetry measurement were taken according to Gao et al. (28Gao W. Pu Y. Luo K.Q. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, human SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum plus 100 mg/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated onto glass bottom dishes and grown to about 75% consistency at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To image cytochrome c, cells were transfected with the cytochrome c-GFP plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 and were allowed to express the fusion gene for 48–72 h. To stain mitochondria, Mitotracker Red CMXRos was added to a final concentration of 20 nm. For living cell measurements, we used a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV500, Tokyo, Japan) to image cytochrome c-GFP distribution and mitochondria morphology simultaneously. Cytochrome c-GFP and Mitotracker were observed at 488 and 568 nm, respectively.After preincubation with Mitotracker Red CMXRos and mecamymine for 15 min, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and placed with 50 μl of fresh culture medium containing mecamylamine. The dish was fixed on the microscope platform, and a single cell was selected (t0), and then 950 μl of culture medium containing the given chemicals was gently added. The photogrammetry started immediately (t1), and pictures were taken in 5-min intervals.Mitochondria Preparation—Mitochondria were extracted as described by Cormier et al. (11Cormier A. Morin C. Zini R. Tillement J.P. Lagrue G. Brain Res. 2001; 900: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 200–250 g) fasting overnight were killed by decapitation; the forebrains were removed and homogenized (6 ml/g of tissue) in ice-cold isolation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2, at 4 °C) using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Mitochondria isolation was immediately performed at 4 °C by using differential centrifugation. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 8 min to remove cell debris and nuclei. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 11 min. The pellet was washed and resuspended in 320 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris base, pH 7.4. Mitochondria kept high respiratory control ratio for the further experiments performed in the next 4 h.To obtain intact mitochondria, Percoll gradient centrifugation was adopted as described by others (29Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Rough mitochondria pellets were obtained as described above, and then the pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of 15% Percoll, and 3-ml fractions of this suspension were laid on two preformed layers consisting of 3.5 ml of 23% Percoll and 3.5 ml of 40% Percoll. The gradient was centrifuged for 5 min at 30,700 × g. The fraction accumulated at the interface of the two lower layers was collected and slowly diluted 1:4 with isolation buffer. The mixture was centrifuged twice at 12,000 × g for 11 min, producing a pellet that was resuspended in 300 ml of respiratory buffer at 4 °C.To get the submitochondria fragment (SMF), crude mitochondria were freeze-thawed three times, washed with 10 volumes of isolation medium, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for another 10 min to collect the SMF pellets (30Zhao Y. Wang Z.B. Xu J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2356-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry, with bovine serum albumin in storage buffer as control.Western Blotting Analysis of Cytochrome c Release from Intact Mitochondria and in Cell Culture—Intact mitochondria (1 mg/ml) from Percoll gradient centrifugation were immediately incubated in respiratory buffer (300 mm mannitol, 10 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2) with and without the tested molecule at a given concentration (see Fig. 2) for 30 min at 25 °C, for a final volume of 1 ml. In these reactions, 5 mm glutamate and 2.5 mm malate were used as respiratory substrates for mitochondria complex I, whereas 5 mm succinate (plus 1 μm rotenone) was used as the respiratory substrate for mitochondria complex II. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the clear supernatants were collected. 15 μg of protein equivalent for each sample was loaded in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then standard Western blot proceeded as instructed by manufacturer of the cytochrome c release apoptosis assay kit. In cell experiment, apoptosis was induced in cell cultures (about 5 × 107) by 2 mm MPP+ administration for 24 h. 1–10 μm nicotine or 10 μm CsA was used in the presence of 20 μm mecamylamine. To detect cytosol cytochrome c, cells were washed and collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cytochrome c was separated by stroke and centrifugation according to the manufacturer's instructions.Mitochondrial Swelling and Membrane Potential Assay—Mitochondria swelling was monitored via the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm in a Hitachi U-2010 ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with thermostatic control. The system is the same as the standard incubation scheme described above, and chemical concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. In most cases, mitochondria were preincubated with nicotine (or CsA) alone or in the presence of low dose Ca2+ (25 μm) at 25 °C for 5 min. Measurement started immediately when MPP+ was added at t1, and 500 μm phosphate was added 2 min after that (t2). In those conditions, i.e. when the effects of high dose of calcium plus phosphate were tested, we only show the effect of nicotine at 100 μm.The change in mitochondria membrane potential was assayed by measuring the retention of rhodamine 123 (Rh123, 200 nm) under the same experimental conditions as described in swelling assay. Rh123-specific fluorescence intensity was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 500 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The base lines were measured for 2 min, and chemicals were then added as described in the figure legends.Assay for Free Radical Generation and Elimination from Complex I—Superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide generation from complex I were detected as described previously (30Zhao Y. Wang Z.B. Xu J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2356-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) by using lucigenin (50 μm) alone or luminol (50 μm) plus horseradish peroxidase (50 units)-derived chemiluminescence, respectively, in the ultra-weak luminescence analysis system (BPCL Inc., Beijing, China). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 200 μg/ml SMF, 200 μm decylubiquinone (a coenzyme Q2 analog), 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4,200μm NADH, and the tested molecules in given concentrations for a total volume of 1 ml. After preincubation at 25 °C for 3 min, SMF was added to launch the reaction, and chemiluminescence was monitored simultaneously. In some cases, 500 units/ml SOD or 400 units/ml catalase were added as positive controls. The integral of the signal peak reflects the formation of total superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. The relationship between chemical concentration and the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide formation is plotted as the integral area of the peak on the ordinate with the chemical concentration on the abscissa.Monitoring of Intra-mitochondria Oxidation and Reduction Status— The pyridine nucleotide oxidation-reduction status was evaluated based on endogenous NAD(P)H fluorescence (excitation-emission, 340–460 nm). The system was the same as described above, where 5 mm glutamate and 2.5 mm malate were added as substrates. To detect intra-mitochondria reduced thiol group concentrations, intact mitochondria pellets were collected as described for cytochrome c assay. Then 100 μl of mitochondria solution (100 μg of protein) were added to 700 μl of methanol and 20 μl of Tris-EDTA (250/20 mm, pH 8.2, at 25 °C). 20 μl of Ellman's reagent (10 mm) was then added, and the reaction was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Absorbance of the medium was read at 410 nm against Ellman's reagent.Statistical Analyses—Data were presented as mean ± S.E. All statistical analyses were completed using the Origin program (Origin 7.5, OriginLab Corp.). Difference between groups was established by one-way or two-way analysis of variance. A probability level of 5% (p < 0.05) was considered significant.RESULTSNicotine Inhibited Cytochrome c Release and Postponed Mitochondria Swelling in SY5Y Cells Independently of nAChRs—After 24 h of incubation, 2 mm MPP+ triggered the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol markedly, whereas 10 μm CsA and 1–10 μm nicotine significantly reduced/prevented concentration of cytochrome c in cytosol, whereas nontreated cells did not show cytosolic cytochrome c (Fig. 1A, Western blot). Under a fluorescence microscope, cytochrome c-GFP (Fig. 1B, grid 1) co-distributed with mitochondria (Fig. 1B, grid 2), and their overlap also normally appeared as thin filaments (Fig. 1B, grid 3), in keeping with a previous report (28Gao W. Pu Y. Luo K.Q. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the condition of swelling, mitochondria changed from filamentous to a spherical shape, and the diameter increased (compare Fig. 1B, grids 5 and 6). This morphological change is because of the fact that the volume-to-surface ratio is higher in a spherical shape than in a rod shape, which adapts to the material influx from cytoplasm during swelling (28Gao W. Pu Y. Luo K.Q. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the sensitivity of the technique did not allow us to detect morphological swelling induced by MPP+ alone (as high as 10 mm) or together with Ca2+ within 30 min (data not shown), sensitive and differentiable effects were obtained by using a neurotoxin mixture containing 200 μm MPP+ and 5 μm 6-OHDA. It instantly resulted in mitochondria high amplitude swelling within 1 min (Fig. 1C, lane 1). At the same time, the co-distribution of green and red fluorescence was disturbed, where the red fluorescence (mitochondria) becomes convergent and spherical, whereas the green fluorescence (cytochrome c-GFP protein) quickly dispersed and separated from the mitochondria. Control experiments ensured that mecamylamine alone (1–50 μm) did not affect the toxic effects of the mixture. Nicotine alone (1–20 μm) or in combination with mecamylamine (in the absence of neurotoxin mixture) had no effect on the fluorescence and morphology (data not shown).FIGURE 1Cytochrome c release and mitochondria swelling in SY5Y cells. A, SY5Y cells were treated with 2 mm MPP+ and 20 μm mecamylamine, and 10 μm CsA or 1–10 μm nicotine was added, respectively (lanes 1–4). Nontreated cells did not show cytochrome c (cyt. c) release (lane 5). Cytoplasmic cytochrome c and actin were detected by Western blot. B, representative photographs showing SY5Y cell expressing cytochrome c-GFP plasmid (grid 1, green), Mitotracker Red CMXRos staining (grid 2, red), the overlap of GFP and Mitotracker Red CMXRos fluorescence (grid 3, yellow), and transmission imaging of the same cell (grid 4). Mitochondria morphology under normal (grid 5) and swelling (grid 6) conditions is also shown. C, by using these markers, cells were preincubated with 20 μm mecamylamine for 15 min and then treated with (lane 1) mixture only, (lane 2) mixture + 10 μm CsA, (lane 3) mixture + 1 μm nicotine, and (lane 4) mixture + 10 μm nicotine. Each experiment is a representative example of three to four similar experiments performed in separate dishes. White scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CsA (10 μm), however, significantly inhibited mitochondria swelling and cytochrome c release. Indeed, green fluorescence co-distributed with the red one all through the experiment (Fig. 1C, lane 2). When cells were preincubated with 20 μm mecamylamine for 15 min followed by 1 μm nicotine for another 15 min (total volume 50 μl), the toxicity of the mixture was postponed because co-localization of cytochrome c-GFP and mitochondria was preserved until 25 min (Fig. 1C, lane 3). However, the high amplitude swelling was not prevented. Preincubation with 20 μm mecamylamine and 10 μm nicotine prevented both cytochrome c release (c-GFP remained inside mitochondria) and high amplitude swelling (Fig. 1C, lane 4).Nicotine Inhibited Cytochrome c Release from Intact Mitochondria—The above experiments were performed on cells, whereas the following experiments used mitochondria preparations to investigate further the mechanisms of nicotine-mediated neuroprotection. When a substrate of mitochondria complex I was supplied, 500 μm MPP+ significantly increased cytochrome c release from intact mitochondria (Fig. 2A, 1ane 6) in comparison with control conditions (Fig. 2A, 1ane 5). When the experiment was changed to a mild condition (25 °C plus 15 min), no detectable cytochrome c was found in control group. However, 500 μm MPP+ still induced remarkable cytochrome c efflux (data not shown). Nicotine dose-dependently inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria, with or without MPP+ (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–10). Nicotine at 100 μm virtually abolished the cytochrome c release in both control and MPP+-treated groups (Fig. 2A). Nicotine also strongly inhibited Ca2+ plus phosphate-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 2B). Nicotine, from 1 μm and beyond, inhibited cytochrome c efflux (Fig. 2B, lane 4) in comparison with the Ca2+-treated group (Fig. 2B, lane 1), even more potently than CsA (Fig. 2B, lane 8) under the same conditions. In the presence of succinate (plus rotenone), 500 μm MPP+ or a high dose of Ca2+ plus phosphate induced a 3–4-fold significant increase in cytochrome c release (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 5) in comparison with the control condition (Fig. 2C, lane 1). Such dramatic increase is almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1 μm CsA (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 7). As 100 μm nicotine had no significant effect under both conditions (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 6), it may suggest a robust effect at the complex I level only.Nicotine Inhibited MPP+- and Ca2-induced Mitochondrial High Amplitude Swelling but Did Not Inhibit the Membrane Potential Loss l—Mitochondria preincubated with a low dose of Ca2+ (25 μm) had a negligible effect on the absorption at 540 nm, even when 500 μm phosphate was added at t2 (curve 1 in Fig. 3, A and B). Different concentrations of nicotine also had no significant effect on this condition (data not shown). On the contrary, MPP+ immediately and dose-dependently induced an absorption decline at 540 nm (Fig. 3A, curves 3–5), suggesting high amplitude swelling. The swelling induced by MPP+ at 500 μm was significantly inhibited by 1 μm CsA (curve 2 in Fig. 3B). Increased nicotine concentration from 0.1 to 1000 μm increasingly delayed the 500 μm MPP+-induced swelling (Fig. 3B, curves 3–7). Nicotine at 100 μm also partly inhibited the 50 μm Ca2+ plus 500 μm phosphate-induced mitochondria high amplitude swelling, whereas 1 μm CsA almost completely prevented the absorption decline (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Mitochondria swelling in response to MPP+ alone (A), 500 μm MPP+ plus CsA or nicotine at various concentrations (B), and high dose of Ca2+-phosphate (Pi) plus 100 μm nicotine or 1 μm CsA. (C) 5 mm glutamate and 2.5 mm malate were used as substrates. A and B, curve 1 is the nontreated group, and curve 2 shows the effects of 1μm CsA. Curves 3–5 in A show the effects of MPP+ concentration at 100, 200, and 500 μm, respectively. B, curve 2 shows the effects of 500 μm MPP+ alone, whereas curves 3–8 show the effects of a combination of 500 μm MPP+ and nicotine at 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0 μm, respectively. C, curves 1–3 represent the swelling of mitochondria treated with CsA + Ca2+, nicotine + Ca2+,or Ca2+ alone, respectively. Each figure is a representative example of three to five similar experiments performed in separate mitochondrial preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Treatment of mitochondria with MPP+ resulted in an immediate increase in Rh123-specific fluorescence, indicating a decline in the mitochondria membrane potential (Fig. 4A, curves 1–4). Increased MPP+ concentrations showed enhanced depletion effects, in keeping with previous reports (31Cassarino D.S. Parks J.K. Parker Jr., W.D. Bennett Jr., J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1453: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4B, curve 1 is a negative control where no MPP+ was added, and thus, no significant decrease in membrane potential was observed. The 500 μm MPP+-induced membrane potential loss (Fig. 4B, curve 3) is inhibited by 1 μm CsA (curve 2). Nicotine concentration below 100 μm had no effect on the Rh123 fluorescence (data not shown). At 100 and 1000 μm, however, nicotine slightly enhanced the membrane potential decrease (Fig. 4B, curves 5 and 6).FIGURE 4Mitochondria membrane potential in response to MPP+ alone (A), 500 μm MPP+ plus CsA or nicotine at various concentrations (B), and high dose of Ca2+-phosphate (Pi) plus 100 μm nicotine or 1 μm CsA (C). 5 mm glutamate and 2.5 mm malate were used as substrates. Mitochondria were treated as described in the swelling assay but for the addition of 200 nm rhodamine 123. A, curves 1–4 show the effects of 0, 100, 200, and 500 μm MPP+, respectively. B, curve 1 represents the control situation without MPP+. Curve 2 shows the effects of adding 1 μm CsA and 500 μm MPP+ on mitochondria membrane potential. Curves 3–6 show the effects of 500 μm MPP+ after having preincubated the mitochondria with 0, 10, 100, and 1000 μm nicotine, re"

Similar results are obtained when Erbb-4 is exogenously expressed in 32D cells, which do not otherwise express any ErbB family members. Expression of the ErbB-4 ICD fragment leads to its constitutive association with Mdm2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of Mdm2, a protein that is predominantly localized in the nucleus and that regulates p53 levels. When the ErbB-4 ICD fragment was expressed in H1299 cells, it promoted Hdm2 ubiquitination and increased the levels of p53 and p21, a transcriptional target of p53. In addition, expression of the ICD fragment increased p53 activity toward the p21 promoter in a luciferase reporter assay.

ErbB-4 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by the binding of its cognate ligands, such as heregulin (neuregulin) (1Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As with other ErbB receptors, ligand binding provokes homo- and heterodimerization, particularly with ErbB-2, leading to tyrosine kinase activation and the initiation of signal transduction pathways. Although ErbB-4 activation can provoke a mitogenic response, frequently the cellular response is the promotion of cell differentiation. Genetic studies in mice reveal an ErbB-4 requirement for differentiation of the mammary gland in the adult (2Jones F.E. Welte T. Fu X.-Y. Stern D.F. J.

ErbB-4 is also novel within this receptor family in regard to its sequential proteolytic processing by α- and γ-secretases. Treatment of cells with heregulin (8Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34737-34743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (9Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) initiates a metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain cleavage of ErbB-4 between His-651 and Ser-652 (10Cheng Q.-C. Tikhomirov O. Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38421-38427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), placing this initial cleavage site eight residues prior to the transmembrane domain, which is typical of an α-secretase activity. Ectodomain cleavage or ErbB-4 is abrogated in TACE (ADAM17) null cells (11Rio C. Buxbaum J.D. Peschon J.J. Corfas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10379-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and recombinant TACE is able to cleave a peptide representing ErbB-4 residues 646–657 between His-651 and Ser-652 (10Cheng Q.-C. Tikhomirov O. Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38421-38427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE) executes this cleavage in vivo. There are two products of ectodomain cleavage: a 120-kDa ectodomain fragment, which can be recovered in the medium, and a membrane-associated 80-kDa (m80) fragment that begins with Ser-652 and includes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of ErbB-4 (9Vecchi M.

In many of these systems, the secretase-liberated ICD fragment is found in the nucleus and is associated with transcriptional activity. However, secretase cleavage of ErbB-4 or the CSF-1 receptor liberates a kinase domain from the plasma membrane and allows for the potential interaction of these kinases with novel substrates.

HIp53 cells were grown in F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—ZR-75–1, 32D, H1299, and HIp53 cells were harvested with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm phosphate buffer, 120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) supplemented with complete mini-protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor mix II. Lysates were precipitated using appropriate antibodies, or the protein concentration of lysates was determined and equal amounts of protein were mixed with SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE prior to Western analysis. Cos7 cells were lysed with TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl) and subjected to immunoprecipitation. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—The ubiquitination of Hdm2 in vivo was detected by co-transfection of H1299 cells with 4 μg of green fluorescent protein-tagged s80 along with 3 μg of Hdm2 and 2 μg of FLAG-tagged ubiquitin in various combinations. Twenty-four hours post-transfection the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline.

Each lysate was boiled at 95 °C for 6 min and incubated with Hdm2 antibodies for 2 h before adding recombinant protein G-Sepharose 4B beads. After overnight incubation, beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and immunoprecipitates were eluted with SDS sample buffer and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was subjected to Western analysis using FLAG antibodies (M2 monoclonal antibody; Sigma) to detect the ubiquitinated Hdm2. p21 Reporter Luciferase Assay—H1299 cells were transfected with 0.75 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, containing the p21 promoter, along with various combinations of 0.5 μg of human p53 recombinant construct (pCEPp53), pCHDM1A (Hdm2) 1.0 μg, and green fluorescent protein-tagged s80 ICD (indicated amounts, Fig. 7). Another reporter plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase under the cytomegalovirus promoter (pRLCMV) 0.025 μg was included in all the transfections as an internal control to measure transfection efficiency. After 24 h of transfection the cells were harvested and dual luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase readings were measured using the BD Monolight luminometer. The p21 promoter activity values were normalized to transfection control reporter Renilla luciferase readings in the same lysate. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Mdm2—Secretase liberation of the ErbB-4 ICD fragment and its translocation to the cytoplasm and nucleus suggest that this cleavage mechanism might allow the ICD fragment to phosphorylate proteins that cannot be accessed by the plasma membrane-localized intact receptor. In an attempt to identify such a novel substrate(s), substrates of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, which is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus (33Wang J.Y.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5643-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), were tested. The results for one such c-Abl substrate, Mdm2 (34Goldberg Z. Sionov R.V. Berger M. Zwang Y. Perets R. Van Etten R.A. Oren M. Taya Y. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), are shown in Fig. 1. Mdm2 is a well characterized ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates p53 levels in cells (35Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and that is predominantly localized in the nucleus (36Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Shenk T. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 1 show that when heregulin is added to ZR-75–1 cells, Hdm2 (human Mdm2) is tyrosine phosphorylated, and this event is prevented by preincubation with the pan ErbB kinase inhibitor PD 153035 (Fig. 1A) or the γ-secretase inhibitor Compound E (1B). To test whether the secretase inhibitor might interfere non-selectively in the phosphorylation of substrates by heregulin receptors, the phosphorylation of Shc was examined under the same conditions. The data in Fig. 1C show that Compound E does not interfere with the heregulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc nor a co-precipitating protein of 170 kDa that likely represents the activated heregulin receptor. The secretase processing of ErbB-4 involves as a prerequisite initial step α-secretase cleavage of the ectodomain (12Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Therefore, heregulin-dependent generation of the ErbB-4 ICD fragment was tested in the presence of the metalloprotease inhibitor BB2983 (Fig. 1D). The results of this experiment demonstrate that heregulin-induced phosphorylation of Hdm2 requires α- and γ-secretase activities. Because secretase processing of ErbB-4 requires ∼10–15 min following the addition of heregulin (14Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 67: 469-478Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 17Srinivasan R. Gillett C.E. Barnes D.M. Gullick W.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1483-1487PubMed Google Scholar), the time course for heregulin-induced phosphorylation of Hdm2 was compared with that for the phosphorylation of Shc, which does not require proteolytic processing of ErbB-4. The data presented in Fig. 2 show that following the addition of heregulin Shc is maximally phosphorylated within 5 min, whereas the phosphorylation of Hdm2 proceeds with a delay of 5–10 min and is gradually phosphorylated thereafter. The relative delay in Hdm2 phosphorylation is likely due to the time required for growth factor-induced secretase processing of ErbB-4 and translocation of the s80 ICD to subcellular compartments. The preceding experiments utilize ZR-75–1 cells that express ErbB-3 and ErbB-4, each of which binds heregulin, as well as their dimerization partner ErbB-2. Hence it is possible that the observed phosphorylation of Hdm2 is mediated by an ErbB-3/ErbB-2 dimer. This seems unlikely, however, as neither ErbB-3 nor ErbB-2 is known to be a secretase substrate. To test that heregulin-dependent phosphorylation of Hdm2 requires only ErbB-4, ErbB-4 (JmaCyt 2 isoform) was expressed in 32D cells, a mouse monocyte precursor cell line that does not otherwise express any ErbB family members (37Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). When heregulin is added to 32D cells expressing ErbB-4, Mdm2 is tyrosine phosphorylated in a γ-secretase-dependent manner, whereas no phosphorylation is detectable in the parental 32D cells treated with heregulin (Fig. 3). This demonstrates that ErbB-4 is sufficient for heregulin-dependent Mdm2 phosphorylation and that neither ErbB-3 nor ErbB-2 is necessary. These results demonstrate that Mdm2 is a novel substrate for receptor tyrosine kinases in that secretase liberation of the ErbB-4 intracellular domain leads to the phosphorylation of a protein, which is predominantly localized in the nucleus and which is not otherwise phosphorylated by the receptor. This is the first report of such a mechanism to expand the repertoire of substrates for receptor tyrosine kinases. Interactions of ErbB-4 ICD Fragment and Mdm2—The results cited above predict that the ICD fragment of ErbB-4 may be sufficient to tyrosine phosphorylate Mdm2. This is tested by the experiment shown in Fig. 4A. Co-expression of the s80 ICD fragment and Hdm2 in Cos7 cells leads to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Hdm2. In this experiment there is a detectable level of Hdm2 phosphorylation in the absence of exogenous ErbB-4 ICD, but this is significantly increased by the presence of the ICD fragment. The data also show that expression of a kinase-negative (K751R) s80 ICD mutant does not provoke Hdm2 phosphorylation. The data in Fig. 4A also show that co-expression of the s80 ICD and Hdm2 results in a lower level of Hdm2 compared with cells that express Hdm2, but not s80. Therefore, densitometry was used to evaluate the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Hdm2 relative to the amount of Hdm2 for the conditions in Fig. 4A. The results indicate that the s80 ICD enhances Hdm2 phosphorylation by a factor of ∼10-fold. This result indicates that the s80 ICD fragment of ErbB-4 is sufficient to provoke Mdm2 phosphorylation and implies that the sole role of heregulin in this event is to initiate the secretase processing of ErbB-4. Given the capacity of the ICD fragment to phosphorylate Hdm2, the association of the two molecules was assessed by co-precipitation, as shown in Fig. 4B. Immunoprecipitation of the ErbB-4 s80 ICD fragment shows co-association of Hdm2 in a manner that is not dependent on s80 kinase activity. This result suggests, but does not prove, that the phosphorylation of Hdm2 by the s80 ICD fragment is direct. In Fig. 4, blots of Hdm2 present in immunoprecipitates (A) or whole cell lysates (B) indicate that the level of Hdm2 is reduced when the s80 ICD fragment is co-expressed. Because Hdm2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can stimulate its own degradation by autoubiquitination (35Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), we tested the capacity of the s80 ICD fragment to influence the ubiquitination of Hdm2. The results, presented in Fig. 5, clearly demonstrate that expression of the s80 ICD fragment enhances Hdm2 ubiquitination. ErbB-4 ICD Fragment Influence on p53—Because Mdm2 is the prime negative regulator of p53 levels in cells, we tested whether the ErbB-4 ICD fragment effects on Hdm2 are also reflected in changes in the cellular levels of p53. The previous data would suggest that the presence of the s80 ICD fragment should, by decreasing Mdm2 levels, increase p53 levels. To test this we utilized a p53 null cell line that has been engineered to inducibly express p53 under the influence of Ponasterone A (38Flatt P.M. Tang L.J. Scatena C.D. Szak S.T. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4210-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This system allows assessment of the influence of the ICD fragment on relatively low levels of p53 found shortly after the addition of Ponasterone A. HIp53 cells were transiently transfected with the s80 ICD fragment, and after 24 h Ponasterone A was added. The results (Fig. 6A, top panel) show that when cells express the s80 ICD fragment there is a more rapid accumulation of p53 following the addition of Ponasterone A, particularly at 6–12 h. In this experiment, changes in the level of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 were also followed (Fig. 6, second panel), as p53 is a transcriptional activator of the p21 gene (32El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lind D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The data show that following the addition of Ponasterone A, p21 levels are increased more rapidly (at 0–6 h) in cells that express the s80 ErbB-4 ICD fragment. In addition, we measured the transcriptional activity of p53, using a p21 luciferase reporter. The data shown in Fig. 7 demonstrate that co-expression of Hdm2 and p53 reduces, by ∼36%, the transcriptional activity of p53 and that the coexpression of the s80 ICD fragment and p53 significantly increases p53-dependent transcription, by ∼100%, which likely represents an effect of the s80 fragment on endogenous Hdm2. Co-expression of p53, Hdm2, and increasing levels of the s80 fragment ICD reverse the inhibitory effect of exogenous Hdm2 on p53-dependent luciferase levels. Hence, this assay of p53 function also indicates that the ErbB-4 ICD fragment is able to modulate the Mdm2 negative regulation of p53. It seems likely that control of Mdm2 function by growth factor activation of the intact ErbB-4 receptor may include other elements besides the s80 ICD fragment. For example, activation of Akt leads to serine phosphorylation of Mdm2 and enhanced Mdm2 stability (35Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). ErbB-2, a heterodimerization partner for ErbB-4, can decrease p53 levels by Akt-mediated serine phosphorylation of Mdm2 (40Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.-C. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In addition, certain isoforms of ErbB-4 can activate Akt (39Kainiluainen V. Sundvall M. Määttä J.A. Santiestevan E. Klagsbrun M. Elenius K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8641-8649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, the capacity of heregulin to modulate p53 levels may be influenced in opposite directions by the level of ICD fragment produced and the intensity of Akt activation.

Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2003; 77: 1094-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, most of the AdoMet generated is used in transmethylation reactions, in which methyl groups are added to compounds and AdoMet is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (2Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In alcoholic liver disease, many of the enzymatic steps in methionine metabolism are affected (3Lu S.C. Tsukamoto H. Mato J.M. Alcohol. 2002; 27: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the intragastric infusion model of ethanol feeding, hepatic levels of methionine, AdoMet, and DNA methylation decrease by ∼40% (4Huang Z.Z. Mao Z. Cai J. Lu S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G14-G21PubMed Google Scholar). The hepatic methionine level depends on the stage of liver injury in rats fed ethanol (5Barak A.J. Beckenhauer H.C. Junnila M. Tuma D.J. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Reduced AdoMet levels and methylation can affect gene expression, membrane fluidity, and GSH levels in liver (2Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 6Lieber C.S. Casini A. DeCarli L.M. Kim C.I. Lowe N. Sasaki R.

Hepatology. 1997; 26: 699-708PubMed Google Scholar). Rats with decreased hepatic levels of AdoMet are predisposed to liver injury caused by lipopolysaccharide, and this effect is prevented by exogenous AdoMet treatment (8Chawla R.K. Watson W.H. Eastin C.E. Lee E.Y. Schmidt J. McClain C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G125-G129PubMed Google Scholar). AdoMet has been used increasingly for the treatment of liver diseases, although the protective mechanisms remain unclear and are likely to be multiple. Impaired mitochondrial uptake of GSH has been postulated to be an important pathogenic factor in alcoholic liver injury. AdoMet administration restores GSH uptake into mitochondria in rats fed ethanol for 4 weeks by preventing changes in mitochondrial membrane fluidity (7Colell A. Garcia-Ruiz C. Morales A. Ballesta A. Ookhtens M. Rodes J. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 699-708PubMed Google Scholar). AdoMet inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) release from macrophages (8Chawla R.K. Watson W.H. Eastin C.E. Lee E.Y. Schmidt J. McClain C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G125-G129PubMed Google Scholar), and it has also been used to prevent the development of hepatocarcinogenesis (9Pascale R.M. Marras V. Simile M.M. Daino L. Pinna G. Bennati S. Carta M. Seddaiu M.A. Massarelli G. Feo F. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4979-4986PubMed Google Scholar) and to increase survival in patients with alcoholic liver disease (10Mato J.M. Camara J.

Excessive collagen I accumulation is the histopathologic hallmark of liver fibrosis. Central to the development and progression of fibrosis are cytokines that are normally involved in matrix remodeling; among them, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) enhances collagen I production and inhibits the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes that catalyze extracellular matrix degradation while enhancing the expression of protease inhibitors (11Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As a result, TGFβ is believed to play a critical role in liver fibrosis. There are no data as to whether administration of AdoMet may affect levels of TGFβ itself and/or the actions of TGFβ on collagen I expression and fibrosis. The current study focused on analyzing potential mechanisms by which administration of AdoMet could decrease collagen I deposition under fibrogenic stimuli. Treatment with AdoMet was found to have a repressive effect on the COL1A2 promoter both in vivo and in vitro. We now propose that these antifibrogenic effects of AdoMet appear to be mediated, at least in part, by lowering TGFβ levels and by inhibiting TGFβ binding to the COL1A2 promoter through a Sp1-pERK1/2 coupled mechanism.

Mice were bred in our institution and received humane care in compliance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the Animal Care Committee of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Chronic liver injury was induced by injecting intraperitoneally 5 ml of CCl4/kg of body weight (25% v/v in mineral oil) three times a week for 4 weeks. AdoMet was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight every day for 4 weeks and was always given 2 h before CCl4. Control groups were injected with mineral oil or mineral oil plus AdoMet alone. Mice were maintained at 22 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle, were fed standard chow diet, had free access to water, and were sacrificed under pentobarbital anesthesia 48 h after the last dose of CCl4. Serum Transaminases—Blood was collected from the retro-orbital vein under anesthesia, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 min, and serum was separated to assay for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) using kits from Sigma (Infinity ALT and AST). Liver Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Liver samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Five-μm sections were dehydrated and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Masson's trichrome and evaluated by a liver pathologist who was blinded from the experimental conditions. The Sirius red/fast green staining was carried out as according to López-De León and Rojkind (19Lopez-De León A. Rojkind M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1985; 33: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Carmiel-Haggai M. Cederbaum A.I. Nieto N. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 136-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was carried out using a rabbit IgG fraction to β-gal (ICN Biomedical), the reporter protein for the COL1A2 promoter activation, and a rabbit IgG to α-smooth muscle actin (α-Sma), a specific marker for stellate cell activation. Alexa Fluor 488 dye-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa Fluor 568 dye-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) were used for immunofluorescent staining of β-gal (corresponding to the active COL1A2 promoter) and α-Sma, respectively, and colocalization by overlaying both stainings using Adobe Photoshop computer software. TGFβ immunostaining was carried out using a TGFβ monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and a ImmunoCruz staining system. Immunoblotting and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoblotting and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (21Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Anti-collagen type I antibody (1/5,000) was kindly provided by Dr. Detlef Schuppan (Harvard Medical School) (22Rombouts K.

Procollagen type I was detected as several bands, i.e. high molecular mass chains of procollagen α1(I) and α2(I) and the N-terminally processed pCα1(I) and pCα2(I). In blots where the intracellular collagen expression was analyzed, the band labeled as collagen I corresponds to the pCα1(I) and pCα2(I), which overlap at ∼200 kDa. In the culture media, intact procollagen predominated, and only little fully processed collagen was present (22Rombouts K. Niki T. Greenwel P. Vandermonde A. Wielant A. Hellemans K. De Bleser P.

Anti-cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) antibody was a gift from Dr. Jerome Lasker (Hackensack Biomedical Research Institute, Hackensack, NJ). Sp1, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein γ (C/EBPγ), C/EBPδ, Smad3, Smad4, ERK1/2, pERK1/2, p38, and pp38 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG (both at 1/10,000) were used as secondary antibodies (Chemicon). For the immunoblotting, pERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated with anti pERK1/2 IgG-protein G-agarose, resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for Sp1. The signal was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). β-Gal Staining and Quantification—Samples were fixed in 10% formalin for 1 h, rinsed, and permeabilized in 0.1 m, pH 7.3, sodium phosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, incubated overnight with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside plus 20 mm potassium ferri- and ferrocyanide in rinsing solution at 37 °C. Samples were washed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline three times, followed by paraffin embedding and sectioning. Finally, 12-μm liver slices were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and counterstained with nuclear fast red for 1 min, rinsed, and rehydrated. Each β-gal staining was also performed using frozen sections from the same tissues that were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and immediately frozen using methylbutane on dry ice. Proteins were extracted from individual livers, and β-gal activity was measured by means of a chemiluminescent reporter assay (Galactolight Plus, Tropix). β-Gal activity was expressed as units/mg of protein. GSH Levels, Lipid Peroxidation, and CYP2E1 Activity—50 μg of liver was homogenized in 5% trichloroacetic acid at a ratio of 1:10 (w/v) and centrifuged for 5 min at 8,000 rpm and 4 °C. GSH levels were determined in the protein free extract by the enzymatic method of Tietze (24Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5554) Google Scholar). Levels of malondialdehyde were measured in liver homogenates using a lipid peroxidation colorimetric assay kit (Calbiochem). Catalytic activity of CYP2E1 was determined as the rate of production of p-nitrocatechol from p-nitrophenol (25Reinke L.A. Moyer M.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1985; 13: 548-552PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (21Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Nieto N. Dominguez-Rosales J.A. Fontana L. Salazar A. Armendariz-Borunda J. Greenwel P. Rojkind M.

Friedman, Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and COL1A2 (provided by Dr. Francesco Ramírez, New York Hospital for Special Surgery) and a cDNA for GAPDH, a housekeeping gene, from the ATCC. Cell Culture and Transfection Experiments—All cell culture experiments were carried out using primary hepatic stellate cells (HSC) isolated by in situ liver perfusion and Histodenz gradient centrifugation (27Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). HSC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum from the beginning of each treatment. The doses of AdoMet, MTA, SAH, and methionine were either 10 or 30 μm. TGFβ was used at 10 ng/ml. Reporter DNA constructs containing upstream sequences of the human COL1A2 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene were provided by Dr. Francesco Ramírez (New York Hospital for Special Surgery) (28Boast S. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these constructs, human COL1A2 sequences span from -3500 to +58 bp (-3500COL1A2-CAT), from -772 to +58 bp (-772COL1A2-CAT), and from -378 to +58 bp (-378COL1A2-CAT) (28Boast S. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel transfection of the corresponding empty vector pEMBL8-CAT at equivalent concentrations were performed. The total amount of plasmid DNA was equalized using pBlue-script SK- (Stratagene). Cells were plated at a density of 105/well in 6-well plates. Complexes containing FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) plus plasmid DNA were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with a final concentration of plasmid DNA for each of the chimeric COL1A2 DNA constructs of 1 μg/ml. Parallel cotransfection with 25 ng/ml of the control pRL-null (Promega) containing the cDNA encoding for Renilla luciferase was performed to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated in the presence of the transfection mix for 24 h, after which the media were replaced and the cells treated with 30 μm AdoMet for 24 h. Samples for the CAT activity were collected, and the reaction was run using a kit from Promega as described previously (29Nieto N. Greenwel P. Friedman S.L. Zhang F. Dannenberg A.J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20136-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). TGFβ—TGFβ was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a kit from BIOSOURCE. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9163) Google Scholar). For the gel mobility shift assays, a probe was generated by digestion with BglII and BstXI (-378 to -183 bp) of the -378COL1A2-CAT plasmid, which contains the TGFβ-responsive element (11Inagaki Y.

Binding reactions in a total volume of 10 μl contained 5 μg of the nuclear protein extract from HSC, 1 μl of 10 × binding buffer, 1 μg/μl poly[d(I-C)], 150 mm KCl, 0.05 mm ZnCl2, and 20,000 cpm of labeled probe at room temperature for 30 min. For competition studies, 200-fold of cold probe was added along with labeled probe. PAGE (6%) was performed at 150 V for 2 h in 0.25 × TBE buffer, the gels were dried under vacuum and exposed overnight using Kodak films. Southwestern Blot Analysis—Southwestern blot analysis was performed by the method of Singh et al. (33Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The membrane containing the immunoprecipitated pERK1/2 bound to the immunoblotted Sp1 was blocked in 10% nonfat dry milk in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). DNA binding was carried out for 3 h with TNE buffer containing 5 μg/ml poly[d(I-C)] and 2 × 105 cpm/ml [γ-32P]dCTP multiprime-labeled BglII and BstXI-digested fragment of the -378COL1A2-CAT plasmid containing the TGFβ-responsive element. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min each with TNE at room temperature and exposed in the PhosphorImager screen. Statistical Analysis—Analyses of variance were performed for all experiments except for those in Fig. 4B, which were analyzed by an unpaired Student's t test. Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. and are the average values of three and six experiments for the in vitro and for the in vivo studies, respectively. Induction of Liver Fibrosis in Mouse COL1A2 Promoter Transgenic Mice and Protection by AdoMet—Administration of CCl4 increased the liver to body weight ratio ∼15% over the non-CCl4-treated mice with no amelioration by AdoMet. Hepatocellular damage and protection by AdoMet were assayed by measuring serum levels of transaminases and by H&E staining. The CCl4 treatment elevated ALT and AST serum levels 7- and 3.5-fold, respectively. AdoMet lowered the elevated ALT levels in the CCl4-treated mice to control levels (Fig. 1A). H&E staining in the CCl4-treated mice revealed the presence of Mallory bodies, lymphocyte infiltration, centrilobular steatosis, and perivenular and pericellular fibrosis; AdoMet prevented these changes and minimized the pathology (Fig. 1B). Similarly, Masson's trichrome staining showed less endogenous total collagen deposition in mice treated with CCl4 plus AdoMet than in the CCl4-treated mice (Fig. 1C). Quantitative analysis of total collagen in Sirius red- and fast green-stained liver sections showed a 2.5-fold increase by CCl4, which was prevented by AdoMet treatment (Fig. 1E). Collagen I expression assessed by Western blot analysis was elevated 3-fold by the CCl4 treatment and reduced by about 50% by coadministration of AdoMet (Fig. 1D). AdoMet Prevents the Activation of the Mouse COL1A2 Promoter in Vivo—Transgenic mice harboring the -17 kb to +54 bp of the proximal promoter of the mouse COL1A2 gene cloned upstream from the E. coli β-gal LacZ reporter gene have been shown to be valuable in studies of activation of the COL1A2 gene in vivo (14Antoniv T.T. De Val S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Kinbara T. Shirasaki F. Kawara S. Inagaki Y. de Crombrugghe B. Takehara K. J. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9286-9292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CCl4 activated the COL1A2 promoter as shown by the β-gal-positive blue staining (Fig. 2A). This activation was repressed in mice cotreated with AdoMet (Fig. 2A). Quantification of the β-gal activity by chemiluminescence showed an approximate 27-fold increase in β-gal activity by CCl4 which was reduced to a 5-fold increase in the presence of AdoMet (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence analysis of mice injected with CCl4 revealed colocalization of α-Sma, a marker for stellate cell activation, and β-gal-positive cells, indicating that the activation of the COL1A2 promoter occurred in HSC (Fig. 2D). AdoMet increased total GSH about 17% in control mice. When CCl4 was injected, a 15% decrease in GSH levels was observed compared with the mineral oil-injected mice; however, cotreatment with AdoMet restored GSH to above control levels (Fig. 3A). AdoMet decreased lipid peroxidation by-products generated under CCl4 treatment to the levels found in control mice (Fig. 3B). Immunostaining for 4-hydroxynonenal showed an extensive but diffuse pattern of positive staining, indicating development of oxidant stress in all liver cells (not shown). CYP2E1 expression and activity were lower in the CCl4-treated mice compared with the control mice because CCl4 is known to lower CYP2E1 levels via radical inactivation and lipid peroxidation (34Sohn D.H. Yun Y.P. Park K.S. Veech R.L. Song B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). AdoMet further decreased CYP2E1 activity and content in the presence of CCl4 (Fig. 3D); this would decrease the potential for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. AdoMet Down-regulates Collagen I in Primary HSC—We analyzed the effect of AdoMet on the expression of collagen I protein in primary HSC. Neither cell viability (95%) nor cell proliferation assessed by [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation was affected by AdoMet treatment (data not shown). HSC were incubated for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days in the presence or absence of 10 or 30 μm AdoMet added daily. Western blot analysis revealed a time-dependent up-regulation of collagen I production (Fig. 4A). AdoMet was very effective in lowering collagen I protein levels in cultured HSC. Part of the generated collagen I is usually secreted into the medium. AdoMet lowered basal intracellular as well as secreted collagen I protein (Fig. 4, A and B). The ability of AdoMet to prevent HSC activation in culture is shown by the 60% decrease in α-Sma levels at 7 days (Fig. 4B). Metabolites of AdoMet, such as SAH and MTA, and methionine, a precursor of AdoMet, were used at 30 μm and found to decrease collagen I protein and COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNA levels in HSC (Fig. 4, C and D); however, the effects mediated by methionine were lower compared with those of the other treatments perhaps because of the extremely low expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A in HSC (36Shimizu-Saito K. Horikawa S. Kojima N. Shiga J. Senoo H. Tsukada K. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments with chimeric constructs harboring progressive 5′-deletions of the human COL1A2 promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene (see scheme in Fig. 5) were performed to identify the promoter regions required for the AdoMet-mediated repressive effect on collagen I production. Primary HSC were transfected with the constructs described in Refs. 28Boast S. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 29Nieto N. Greenwel P. Friedman S.L. Zhang F. Dannenberg A.J. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5, the basal acetylation of chloramphenicol in HSC transfected with the -3500COL1A2-CAT and the -378COL1A2-CAT plasmids was similar. On the other hand, the activity of the -772COL1A2-CAT vector was significantly lower. The -772 to -378 region of the human or mouse COL1A2 gene contains a silencer element (28Boast S. Su M.W.

Hepatology. 1995; 22: 573-579PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of 30 μm AdoMet for 24 h after transfection decreased the basal activity of both the -3500COL1A2-CAT and the -378COL1A2-CAT reporter vectors. It is interesting that AdoMet lowered CAT activity in cells transfected with the -378COL1A2-CAT construct, which contains the -378 to +58 bp region that is essential for increased basal COL1A2 expression and responsiveness to oxidative stress and cytokines such as TNFα and TGFβ (11Inagaki Y.

https://openalex.org/W2086940941,"The ubiquitous bacterial cell wall sugar N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) carries a unique d-lactyl ether substituent at the C3 position. Recently, we proposed an etherase capable of cleaving this lactyl ether to be part of the novel bacterial MurNAc dissimilation pathway (Dahl, U., Jaeger, T., Nguyen, B. T., Sattler, J. M., Mayer, C. (2004) J. Bacteriol. 186, 2385–2392). Here, we report the identification of the first known MurNAc etherase. The encoding gene murQ is located at 55 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome adjacent to murP, the MurNAc-specific phosphotransferase system. A murQ deletion mutant could not grow on MurNAc as the sole source of carbon and energy but could be complemented by expressing murQ from a plasmid. The mutant had no obvious phenotype when grown on different carbon sources but accumulated MurNAc 6-phosphate at millimolar concentrations from externally supplied MurNAc. Purified MurQ-His6 fusion protein and extracts of cells expressing murQ both catalyze the cleavage of MurNAc 6-phosphate, with GlcNAc 6-phosphate and d-lactate being the primary products. The 18O label from enriched water is incorporated into the sugar molecule, showing that the C3–O bond is cleaved and reformed by the enzyme. Moreover, an intermediate was detected and identified as an unsaturated sugar molecule. Based on this observation, we suggested a lyase-type mechanism (β-elimination/hydration) for the cleavage of the lactyl ether bond of MurNAc 6-phosphate. Close homologs of murQ were found on the chromosome of several bacteria, and amino acid sequence similarity with the N-terminal domain of human glucokinase-regulatory protein (GckR or GKRP) was recognized.

The bacterial cell wall sugar N-acetylmuramic acid (Mur-NAc), 1The abbreviations used are: MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-[(R)-1-carboxyethyl]-d-glucopyranose); MMA, minimal medium A; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ESI, electrospray ionization; PTS, phosphotransferase system; Kmr, kanamycin resistance cassette; SIS, sugar phosphate isomerase/sugar phosphate-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-[(R)-1-carboxyethyl]-d-glucopyranose); MMA, minimal medium A; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ESI, electrospray ionization; PTS, phosphotransferase system; Kmr, kanamycin resistance cassette; SIS, sugar phosphate isomerase/sugar phosphate-binding protein. together with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), forms the backbone of the cell wall peptidoglycan of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (1Seltmann G. Holst O. The Bacterial Cell Wall. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2002: 105-132Google Scholar). The bacterial peptidoglycan (murein) can be cleaved by peptidoglycan hydrolases (muramidases), such as lysozyme, (endo-) N-acetylglucosaminidases, and amidases (2Jollès P. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1969; 8: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Höltje J.-V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the fate of the monosaccharide MurNAc is unknown. MurNAc can be utilized by Escherichia coli (4Parquet C. Flouret B. Leduc M. Hirota Y. van Heijenoort J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Dahl U. Jaeger T. Nguyen B.T. Sattler J.M. Mayer C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and other bacteria (5Dahl U. Jaeger T. Nguyen B.T. Sattler J.M. Mayer C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Recently, we identified a phosphotransferase system (PTS) of E. coli, MurP, that is required for phosphorylation and concomitant transport of MurNAc across the cytoplasmic membrane (5Dahl U. Jaeger T. Nguyen B.T. Sattler J.M. Mayer C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, we recognized that the MurNAc dissimilation pathway enters the GlcNAc pathway on the level of GlcNAc 6-phosphate (Fig. 1) and thus involves the cleavage of the lactyl ether substituent of MurNAc 6-phosphate by a hypothetical “etherase” prior to deacetylation and deamination of the sugar (6Mayer C. Boos W. Curtiss III, R. Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2005Google Scholar). However, neither the lactyl ether-cleaving enzyme nor the second reaction product, other than GlcNAc 6-phosphate, have yet been identified. The trivial name etherase implies catalysis by hydrolytic scission of the substrate; however, cleavage of ether bonds is catalyzed by a heterogeneous group of enzymes or enzyme systems exhibiting a variety of mechanisms, including oxidoreductase and lyase-type reactions (7White G.F. Russell N.J. Tidswell E.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 216-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An example of an etherase that catalyzes the direct hydrolysis of a C–O bond similar to the MurNAc lactyl ether bond is the isochorismate pyruvate hydrolase (isochorismatase; E.C. 3.3.2.1) (8Young I.G. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 177: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a vinyl ether-functional group (an ether-bound enolpyruvate), yielding pyruvate as one of the products (9Parsons J.F. Calabrese K. Eisenstein E. Ladner J.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5684-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This reaction resembles the reverse of the biosynthesis pathway in which UDP-MurNAc is formed from UDP-GlcNAc and phosphoenolpyruvate in a two-step process. In the first step, the transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate to position 3 of the GlcNAc residue is catalyzed by a transferase (MurA) to yield UDP-GlcNAc-enolpyruvate. In the second step, the reduction of the enolpyruvate moiety to d-lactyl is catalyzed by a reductase (MurB) to yield UDP-MurNAc (10van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The only etherase cloned and sequenced so far is LigE, an enzyme from Pseudomonas paucimobilis (Sphingomonas paucimobilis) (11Masai E. Katayama Y. Kawai S. Nishikawa S. Yamasaki M. Morohoshi N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7950-7955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was shown to be a glutathione S-transferase (12Masai E. Katayama Y. Nishikawa S. Fukuda M. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 23: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Masai E. Ichimura A. Sato Y. Miyauchi K. Katayama Y. Fukuda M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1768-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This enzyme degrades low molecular weight lignin and catalyzes the reductive cleavage of arylglycerol-β-aryl ethers (12Masai E. Katayama Y. Nishikawa S. Fukuda M. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 23: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Oxidoreductases that catalyze the oxygenative cleavage of an ether bond are, for example, the 4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase and the glyceryl-ether monooxygenase (14Snyder F. Malone B. Piantadosi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Ishibashi T. Imai Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mechanism of anaerobic cleavage of 2-phenoxyethanol involves the shift of a hydroxyl group to the subterminal carbon atom to form an unstable hemiacetal (16Speranza G. Mueller B. Orlandi M.

Microbiol. 1994; 162: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Finally, carbon-oxygen lyases catalyze β-elimination reactions, with carboxy-methyl-oxysuccinate lyase (18Peterson D. Llaneza J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) being one example. Here, we identified the first lactyl etherase acting on the natural substrate MurNAc. It is encoded by murQ (previously yfeU) located upstream of the gene murP encoding the Mur-NAc-PTS of E. coli. Purified MurQ protein releases d-lactate and GlcNAc 6-phosphate as the primary reaction products. [18O]GlcNAc 6-phosphate was identified when the reaction was performed within [18O]water and a Morgan-Elson chromogen was identified as the reaction intermediate. We proposed a lyase-type mechanism of catalysis that involves the formation of a Δ2,3-GlcNAc 6-phosphate intermediate. Construction of Etherase Deletion Mutants—murQ (formerly named yfeU) of E. coli strain DY330 (F– Δ (argF-lac)U169 gal-490 (λcI857 Δcro/broA)) was deleted by replacement with a kanamycin resistance cassette (Kmr) according to a modification (5Dahl U.

J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar) yielding the deletion strain TJ2 (MC4100 murQ::Kmr). Construction of Etherase Expression Vectors—DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digestions, ligations, and transformations were performed according to standard techniques. murQ from E. coli MG1655 was amplified by PCR using 50 ng of chromosomal DNA and the following primers: 5′-CAC CAC CCA TGG AAT TTG AAA AGA TGA TTA C-3′, 5′-GAT CTC TTA AGC TTA AGA TCT TTC CTT GTC TAA AAC C-3′ (underlined are the recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases NcoI, HindIII, and BglII, respectively). The reaction mixture was heated to 95 °C prior to the addition of 1 unit of Pyrococcus woesei DNA polymerase (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). Thirty-five cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 48 °C, and 150 s at 72 °C) were performed in a thermal cycler and revealed a single 0.9-kb fragment, as analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplified DNA was cloned into vector pCS19 (5Dahl U. Jaeger T. Nguyen B.T. Sattler J.M. Mayer C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), positioning the gene murQ under the control of the T5 promoter and the lac repressor. Digestion with NcoI and BglII and subsequent ligation generated plasmid pUB9 for the expression of the C-terminal His6 fusion protein, and digestion with NcoI and HindIII and ligation generated pUH5 for the expression of the native protein. Growth Conditions and MurNAc 6-Phosphate Accumulation— Strains MC4100 and TJ2 were cultivated in shaking flasks at 37 °C in minimal medium A (MMA) (21Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992: 25.4Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% MurNAc (6.8 mm) (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland). For complementation studies, strain TJ2 was transformed with plasmids pUH5 or pUB9. Ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (0.05 mm) were added to the growth medium. Growth was monitored at 578 nm using an Ultrospec 3100pro spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). For accumulation experiments, the strains were grown at 37 °C on MMA (10 ml) supplemented with 0.4% (43 mm) glycerol (Sigma) until they reached the logarithmic growth phase (A578 = 0.5), and then 0.1% MurNAc (3.4 mm) was added and growth continued until the stationary phase. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), resuspended in 15% trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). MurNAc 6-phosphate was isolated from the TLC plates prior to charring by extracting scratched-out silica gel material with a small amount of distilled water. Analysis of Sugars and Sugar Phosphates by TLC—Samples containing sugars and sugar phosphates were spotted onto TLC plates (Silica 60 F254, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and air dried. The following sugar standard solutions were used: 13.4 mm MurNAc 6-phosphate (10 μl), 72.7 mm GlcNAc 6-phosphate (1 μl), 77 mm glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN 6-phosphate; 1 μl), 68.2 mm MurNAc (10 μl), 928 mm glucosamine (GlcN; 1 μl), and 904 mm GlcNAc (1 μl). The TLC was developed in two different, (i) a basic solvent system containing n-butyl alcohol normal:methanol:NH3 (25% H2O):distilled water (5:4:2:1) or (ii) an acid n-butyl alcohol normal:ethanol:5% formate (5:3:2) system. The TLC plates were air-dried and subsequently processed using 5% sulfuric acid in methanol and charred at 180 °C for 5 min. Origin and Preparation of Sugars and Sugar Phosphates—MurNAc 6-phosphate probes for mass spectrometric analysis and for the enzymatic reaction assays were prepared from etherase mutant cells grown on MurNAc. The cells were incubated with trichloroacetic acid (15%) and kept on ice for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant containing soluble material was applied to a TLC plate. The sugar phosphate was isolated from the TLC plate prior to charring by extracting scratched-out silica gel material with methanol. The extract was lyophilized and dissolved in a small amount of distilled water or [18O]water. The MurNAc 6-phosphate standard was prepared previously from MurNAc, using membrane vesicles isolated from strains carrying the MurNAc-PTS MurP, incubated together with purified soluble PTS components and phosphoenolpyruvate at pH 7.3 and 37 °C. 2U. Dahl, B. Bosbach, and C. Mayer, unpublished data. MurNAc and muramic acid (MurN) were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). AnhydroMurNAc was kindly provided by Dr. Niels Kubasch (Fachbereich Chemie, Lehrstuhl Prof. R. R. Schmidt, University of Konstanz, Germany). Other sugars and sugar phosphates were from Sigma. Expression and Purification of Etherase—E. coli strain BL21 (F– ompT hsd SB(rB– mB–) gal dcm) carrying pUB9 was grown at 37 °C in LB with ampicillin (200 μg/ml). At an A578 of 0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.05 mm, and incubation was continued for 3 h with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4.000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to prevent oxidation of cysteines of the enzyme). The cells were broken by passing them three times through a French pressure cell. Debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The His-tagged protein in the supernatant was purified on a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 20 to 250 mm imidazole that also contained 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The peak fractions were pooled and stored at –20 °C with dithiothreitol and glycerol added to yield 1 mm and 20% final concentration, respectively. Identification of Products of the Etherase Reaction—MurNAc 6-phosphate samples were incubated at 37 °C and pH 7.5 with purified MurQ-His6 fusion protein or with soluble extracts from TJ2 cells expressing murQ from a plasmid. The first reaction product, GlcNAc 6-phosphate, was analyzed by TLC and mass spectrometry. The reaction was performed in H2O and [18O]water to identify a product carrying the 18O label by a shift in mass. The second product of the etherase reaction, lactate, was analyzed by a coupled enzyme assay with either d- or l-lactate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science). The amount of NADH formed in the coupled enzyme assay was determined by measuring the absorption at 340 nm. To shift the equilibrium of the coupled enzyme reaction to the product side, pyruvate was trapped in a subsequent reaction in the presence of l-glutamate by glutamate-pyruvate transaminase. Analysis of the Reaction Intermediate—A reaction intermediate was identified with Ehrlich's reagent (dimethylaminobenzaldehyde) in a color reaction according to the modified Morgan-Elson protocol (23Reissig J. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of borate, which induces base-catalyzed formation of the chromogen, etherase preparations were applied. In brief, 2 μl of enzyme was added to 10 μl of sugar phosphate (GlcNAc 6-phosphate, MurNAc 6-phosphate; 10–100 mm) and incubated for 5–30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, 60 μl of Ehrlich's reagent was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was carried out on an Alliance HT model 2695 liquid chromatography system (Waters Corp.) coupled to a Micromass QUATTRO mass spectrometry system (Micromass, Beverly, MA) supplied with MassLynx NT version 4.0 software (Micromass). Following a 20-μl injection, the sample was eluted at 250 μl/min. Mobile phase A was 99.9% water and 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B was 99.9% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Separation was achieved with the tandem coupling of a Phenomenex HyperClone C18 (00F-4361-BO) column (150 × 2 mm; 5 μm) (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA). Eluent from the liquid chromatography system was analyzed using an electrospray ionization (ESI) technique. Sample solutions were introduced into the ion source at the flow rate of 250 μl/min via a metal capillary held at high voltage (1.8 kV). The source block temperature was 150 °C, and the desolvation temperature was 250 °C; the desolvation gas was set at 400 liters/h. Nitrogen was used as both a nebulizing gas and drying gas. The instrument was operated in the negative ion mode, which typically reports the characteristic appearance of [M-H]– ions of acidic saccharides that exist in anionic form in solutions. MurQ Is Required for Growth on MurNAc—murQ, the gene adjacent to murP (encoding the MurNAc-specific phosphotransferase system (4Parquet C. Flouret B. Leduc M. Hirota Y. van Heijenoort J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), was deleted by homologous gene replacement, yielding strain TJ2. No growth of TJ2 on MurNAc, as the sole source of carbon and energy, was detected even after 40 h of incubation (Fig. 2). The growth defect was not due to a polar effect of the murQ deletion on murP, because murP provided from a plasmid (5Dahl U. Jaeger T. Nguyen B.T. Sattler J.M. Mayer C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2385-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) did not restore growth (data not shown). However, providing MurQ or MurQ-His6 in trans expressed from an IPTG-inducible plasmid (pUH5 or pUB9, respectively) rescued growth of the murQ deletion strain on Mur-NAc (Fig. 2). Complementation with MurQ-His6 required induction to restore full growth on MurNAc, whereas complementation with MurQ was observed even in the absence of IPTG (data not shown). This might indicate lower activity of MurQ-His6 compared with MurQ; however, it can also be explained by higher protein levels of MurQ, as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Overexpression of recombinant MurQ/MurQ-His6 and purification of MurQ-His6. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. A, soluble extracts of strain BL21 carrying pUB9 (MurQ-His6; lanes 1 and 2) or pUH5 (MurQ; lanes 3 and 4) prior to induction (lanes 1 and 3) and after induction for 3 h with 0.05 mm IPTG (lanes 2 and 4). Lanes 1–4 contained 15 μg of protein each. B, MurQ-His6 fusion protein (5 μg) purified by nickel-chelating chromatography (lane 2). Size standards are shown (A, lane 5) (B, lane 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It should be noted that, in contrast to wild type E. coli (MC4100), no lag phase was observed for the growth of TJ2 (murQ::Kmr) on MurNAc when complemented with MurQ (Fig. 2). Slightly higher growth rates were also seen in the complemented strain compared with wild type E. coli. This observation can be explained by low level constitutive expression of murP from the promoter of the kanamycin resistance gene (Kmr replaces murQ), which is located upstream in TJ2. Therefore, the MurNAc-PTS does not require induction in TJ2, but it does in wild type E. coli. MurQ Requires Reducing Conditions for Activity and Stability—Purification of active etherase was complicated by the fact that this enzyme contains seven cysteine residues that make it extremely sensitive to oxidation. Therefore, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the cells before disruption and to buffers for nickel affinity chromatography. Purified etherase was only active for a few days at 4 °C. However, the enzyme could be stabilized in imidazole buffer (pH 8.0) by adding 20% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and activity was retained for at least several weeks when stored at –20 °C. It is unclear whether the cysteines are essential for enzyme function. A murQ Mutant Accumulates MurNAc 6-Phosphate—Besides the growth defect on minimal medium MurNAc, no obvious phenotype was observed when the MurQ knock-out strain was grown on other carbon sources in minimal or rich medium. However, TJ2 (murQ::Kmr) cells (but not wild type E. coli cells) grown on glycerol in MMA accumulated a metabolite when MurNAc was added to the cells. This accumulation product shows the same mobility on TLC (using two different solvent systems) as MurNAc 6-phosphate (Fig. 4, TLC using a basic solvent system is shown), which had been prepared by in vitro phosphorylation of MurNAc with inverted vesicles carrying the MurNAc-specific PTS MurP.2 This accumulation product was isolated from TLC and analyzed by ESI-mass spectrometry. A mass of 371.73 was found (Fig. 6A), which is consistent, within error, with the theoretical mass of MurNAc 6-phosphate (372.08).Fig. 6Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis (negative ion mode) of substrate and product of the etherase reaction. A, the accumulation product MurNAc 6-phosphate (MurNAc P) of TJ2 grown on MMA glycerol plus MurNAc (Fig. 4, lane 4) could clarify here that “TLC spots” are what were subjected to ESI. B and C, the product of the reaction of MurNAc P with MurQ-His6 in H2O and [18O]water, respectively, were analyzed by ESI-mass spectrometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The concentration of accumulated MurNAc 6-phosphate in MurQ mutant cells supplied with MurNAc was calculated to be in the range of 30 mm. Interestingly, accumulation of MurNAc 6-phosphate did not affect growth on glycerol (data not shown). In general, sugar phosphate accumulation has been shown to severely affect growth; e.g. GlcNAc 6-phosphate accumulation in a nagB strain (nagB polar on nagA) in the presence of GlcNAc in the medium has been reported to lead to growth arrest (24Rolls J.P. Shuster C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 894-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear why, in the case of MurNAc 6-phosphate, accumulation seems not to be toxic for the cells. MurQ Converts MurNAc 6-Phosphate into GlcNAc 6-Phosphate and d-Lactate—Cell extracts containing overexpressed MurQ and purified MurQ-His6 protein cleave MurNAc 6-phosphate, yielding GlcNAc 6-phosphate, as analyzed by TLC (Fig. 5 and by ESI-mass spectrometry (Fig. 6B). A mass value of 299.83 was found, which is in good agreement with the mass of GlcNAc 6-phosphate (300.06). Performing the etherase reaction in [18O]water led to the identification of an 18O-labeled product with a mass increased by 2 units (Fig. 6C). Besides GlcNAc 6-phosphate, we determined d-lactate (but not l-lactate) to be released from MurNAc 6-phosphate by the reaction with purified MurQ-His6 protein, as measured with a coupled d- and l-lactate dehydrogenase enzyme assay system (Table I). We tested other possible sugars as substrates of MurQ, but the purified enzyme was active only on phosphorylated MurNAc. MurNAc was not a substrate nor were anhydro-MurNAc or muramic acid (MurN).Table IStereochemistry of lactate released from MurNAc 6-phosphate by etheraseSubstrateConcentration g/literl-Lactate g/literd-Lactate g/literd-Lactate0.20200.184l-Lactate0.2020.1940MurNAc 6PaSubstrate generated by in vitro phosphorylation.NDcND, not determined.00.117MurNAc 6PbSubstrate generated by accumulation in TJ2 cells.ND00.198a Substrate generated by in vitro phosphorylation.b Substrate generated by accumulation in TJ2 cells.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Detection of a Morgan-Elson Chromogen Produced by MurQ—Most interestingly, a chromogenic compound was generated when MurNAc 6-phosphate was incubated with etherase but not in the absence of the enzyme or when inactivated enzyme preparations were tested. This compound had an absorption maximum of ∼235 nm, and it decolored bromine water and reacted with Ehrlich's reagent to yield a purple product. The color occurred without heating of the MurNAc 6-phosphate sample in borate buffer, indicating that an unsaturated sugar, a Morgan-Elson chromogen (23Reissig J. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was formed as a product of the enzyme reaction. The same reaction intermediate was detected when GlcNAc 6-phosphate was incubated with etherase, indicating the reversibility of the enzymatic reaction. Based on the color reaction, we are now developing an etherase assay to perform detailed kinetic measurements. MurQ Homologs Are Found in Many Bacteria; However Not in All—MurQ homologs were found on the chromosome of other enterobacteria and in related γ-proteobacteria of the genera Vibrio and Pasteurella, as well as in cyanobacteria. MurQ homologs were, however, not found in Pseudomonas sp. and β-proteobacteria. Interestingly, close homologs of MurQ were also found in many Gram-positive bacteria, in members of the genera Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Clostridia, and Actinobacillus. The MurNAc dissimilation might therefore be a universal pathway of many bacteria (but not all), and MurNAc dissimilation might be used as a criteria for the taxonomy of bacteria. We describe in this paper the identification of an etherase (MurQ) that catalyzes the cleavage of the d-lactyl ether substituent of MurNAc 6-phosphate, representing a novel class of etherase enzymes. Active His6-tagged fusion protein was purified to homogeneity and was shown by TLC, mass spectrometry, and coupled enzyme assay to yield GlcNAc 6-phosphate and d-lactate. When the reaction was performed in [18O]water, the label was incorporated in the product GlcNAc phosphate and not lactate, indicating that the C3–O bond is cleaved and reformed by the enzyme. Usually, ether linkages are comparably resistant to chemical or enzymatic cleavage, because the C–O bond energy is high (25Spier J.L. Chemistry. 1964; 37: 6-11Google Scholar). However, the lactyl ether bond of MurNAc and its derivatives, in which reducing groups are free, can be cleaved spontaneously under mild alkaline conditions (26Tipper D.J. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1441-1449Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The H2 proton in the α position relative to the anomeric carbonyl is acidic. Deprotonation and subsequent elimination of the C3 substituent leads to the formation of a 2,3-unsaturated sugar, Δ2,3-Glc-NAc. This intermediate is the so-called Morgan-Elson chromogen I, which reacts further to generate an aromatic furan derivative, the Morgan-Elson chromogen III (26Tipper D.J. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1441-1449Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). That chromogen can be identified through reaction with Ehrlich's reagent, which yields a purple-colored Morgan-Elson product (23Reissig J. Strominger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified a Morgan-Elson chromogen being formed by the enzyme proceeding in both the forward and reverse directions. This reaction intermediate has an absorption maximum of ∼235 nm, consistent with the absorption maximum of Morgan-Elson chromogen I. It decolorized bromine water (data not shown) and reacted with Ehrlich's reagent. Based on this finding, we expect MurQ to catalyze a two-step β-elimination/hydration reaction. A high steady-state level of the intermediate is formed, most likely Δ2,3-GlcNAc 6-phosphate, indicating that hydration is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. According to the suggested mechanism (Fig. 7), a catalytic base provided by the enzyme removes the H2 proton of Mur-NAc 6-phosphate. Subsequent elimination of the lactyl substituent with retention of the d-configuration leads to the formation of the Δ2,3-GlcNAc intermediate (Morgan-Elson chromogen I). Subsequent addition of water to the double bond of the intermediate (a Michael addition acceptor) finally yields GlcNAc 6-phosphate. Performing the reaction in [18O]water led to the identification of 18O-labeled GlcNAc-6-phosphate (Fig. 7). It is obvious that the H2 proton of MurNAc 6-phosphate is only acidic when the sugar carries a reducing end and is able to adopt an open chain configuration. It is therefore not surprising that anhydro-MurNAc cannot act as a substrate in the MurQ reaction. A similar mechanism that can be viewed as a mirror image of the etherase mechanism has recently been proposed for members of family 4 of glycosyl hydrolases (GH-F4) (27Yip V.L. Varrot A. Davies G.J. Rajan S.S. Yang X. Thompson J. Anderson W.F. Withers S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8354-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Varrot A. Yip V.L. Li Y. Rajan S.S. Yang X. Anderson W.F. Thompson J. Withers S.G. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Rajan S.S. Yang X. Collart F. Yip V.L. Withers S.G. Varrot A. Thompson J. Davies G.J. Anderson W.F. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1619-1629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These enzymes act on glycosides, hence the anomeric carbonyl is not free and the H2 not acidic. However, a carbonyl is introduced at the C3 position in a NAD-dependent redox step, which renders the H2 significantly more acidic, thereby facilitating deprotonation and subsequent elimination of the aglycon via fission of the anomeric C–O bond (cleavage of the glycosidic bond). The proposed intermediate of the reaction is a 1,2-unsaturated sugar (a Michael addition acceptor) that can be attacked by water to yield the 3-keto sugar. The 3-keto group is then reduced by the on-board NADH, recovering NAD and returning the enzyme to its starting state. MurQ can be assigned to the sugar phosphate isomerase/sugar phosphate-binding protein (SIS) family (30Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 94-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of MurQ with the E. coli chromosome shows high similarity with the SIS domain of GlmS, the glucosamine-fructose 6-phosphate (isomerizing) aminotransferase (31Badet B. Vermoote P. Haumont P.Y. Lederer F. LeGoffic F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1940-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Besides the SIS domain, GlmS also contains a glutaminase domain. Ammonia generated by the glutaminase domain serves to form a Schiff base with C2 of fructose 6-phosphate (C–N lyase mechanism), and the Schiff base is then isomerized to glucosamine 6-phosphate. Moreover, MurQ is homologous to another member of the SIS family, the fructoselysine 6-phosphate deglycase, FrlB (YhfN) (32Wiame E. Delpierre G. Collard F. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42523-42529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). FrlB catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructoselysine 6-phosphate and water to glucose 6-phosphate and lysine. A mechanism similar to that of GlmS was suggested (32Wiame E. Delpierre G. Collard F. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42523-42529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar): the C–N bond between the sugar phosphate molecule (fructose 6-phosphate) and the amino acid lysine is cleaved (C–N lyase reaction), and the product is then isomerized, yielding glucose 6-phosphate. Hence, GlmS and FrlB are both C–N lyases and characterized by a mechanism similar to that proposed for MurQ (Fig. 7). However, it is not clear whether the etherase reaction also depends on a Schiff base being formed. Interestingly, MurQ displays high amino acid sequence similarity (26% identity) with the N-terminal domain of human glucokinase regulatory protein (GckR or GKRP), another member of the SIS family (33van Schaftingen E. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Niculescu L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In vivo GckR reversibly binds to glucokinase (hexokinase IV) and competitively inhibits its activity. The regulatory protein exists in two different conformations: one (R) able to bind fructose 6-phosphate and glucokinase and the other (R′) able to bind fructose 1-phosphate but not glucokinase. In the absence of metabolite, the R′ form predominates and glucokinase is active. Fructose 6-phosphate shifts the equilibrium toward R, hence reinforcing inhibition. Fructose 1-phosphate sequesters the R′ form and has therefore the opposite effect. It is not known whether the sequence similarity between MurQ and GckR just reflects sugar phosphate binding or whether the lyase reaction of MurQ has some equivalence in the human protein. We found that MurQ is essential for growth on MurNAc, as the sole source of carbon and energy. However, E. coli is able to re-utilize its own cell wall in addition to dissimilating exogenous MurNAc. In this process, 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhydro-MurNAc) is formed within the cytoplasm. The further processing of anhydro-MurNAc had been postulated to proceed through an etherase that generates GlcNAc from anhydro-MurNAc (34Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3842-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, a kinase encoded by gene ydhH at 37 min on the E. coli chromosome has been identified that phosphorylates anhydro-MurNAc, presumably at the C6 position (35Uehara T. Suefuji K. Valbuena N. Meehan B. Donegan M. Park J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, cell wall recycling and dissimilation of Mur-NAc from the environment yield the same metabolite, MurNAc 6-phosphate, which might be further metabolized by the same etherase enzyme. The murQ deletion strain (TJ2) did not grow on MurNAc, even when incubated for prolonged times, indicating that MurQ is the only lactyl etherase of E. coli. Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate the role of MurQ in cell wall recycling. We have not detected MurNAc phosphate in etherase mutant cells without the addition of MurNAc to the medium. However, this might be explained by the limited sensitivity of detection of MurNAc 6-phosphate with the TLC method. It was estimated that intracellular concentrations of MurNAc 6-phosphate <2 mm cannot be detected with the TLC method, which might be too high a value to reach within the cells solely through the recycling of cell wall murein. We are currently studying the role of MurQ in cell wall recycling, and we are trying to obtain a three-dimensional structure with the aim of obtaining a detailed understanding of the etherase mechanism on the molecular level.

Our steady-state and transient kinetic measurements on single-headed constructs reveal that a single Drosophila myosin V molecule spends most of its mechanochemical cycle time detached from actin, therefore it has to function in processive units that comprise several molecules. Accordingly, in in vitro motility assays, double-headed Drosophila myosin V requires high surface concentrations to exhibit a continuous translocation of actin filaments. Our comparison between vertebrate and fly myosin V demonstrates that the well preserved function of myosin V motors in cytoplasmic transport can be accomplished by markedly different underlying mechanisms.

Vertebrate myosin Va has been characterized extensively from many aspects including its enzymatic cycle (1De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Other members of the myosin V family from vertebrates and yeast have been studied mainly from a cell biological point of view, and they all seem to adopt the same niche regarding their role: they participate in the short range transport and orientation of membrane particles, cellular organelles, and mRNA-protein complexes (13Catlett N.L.

Vertebrate myosin Va has served as the sole biochemical example so far, and it is not known how universal its mechanism of action is within the myosin V family. Although it has been shown by indirect assays that the two yeast myosin V members, Myo2p and Myo4p, may be low duty cycle motors (18Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) neither solution kinetic nor single molecule data are available to corroborate that hypothesis. The absence of comparative knowledge has hindered the delineation of the structural and enzymatic features that are indispensable to accomplish the tasks carried out by myosin V.We have performed a detailed molecular characterization of recombinant Drosophila myosin V (DmV) 1The abbreviations used are: DmV, Drosophila myosin V; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; dCaM, Drosophila calmodulin; dmantADP and dmantATP, N-methylantranoyl derivatives of 2′-deoxy-ADP and ATP, respectively; HMM, heavy meromyosin-like; i-, loop 2 insertion; MDCC-PBP, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide-labeled phosphate-binding protein; Mlc-c, cytoplasmic myosin light chain 1; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; S1, subfragment 1. 1The abbreviations used are: DmV, Drosophila myosin V; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; dCaM, Drosophila calmodulin; dmantADP and dmantATP, N-methylantranoyl derivatives of 2′-deoxy-ADP and ATP, respectively; HMM, heavy meromyosin-like; i-, loop 2 insertion; MDCC-PBP, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide-labeled phosphate-binding protein; Mlc-c, cytoplasmic myosin light chain 1; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; S1, subfragment 1. constructs in an attempt to shed light on the common enzymatic features of myosin V-type motors. This study is part of a multilateral approach in our laboratory to building a Drosophila model system for the role of myosin V. The schematic structure of a DmV molecule in Fig. 1A demonstrates that the structural domain architecture of DmV is identical to that of vertebrate myosin V. DmV is represented by a single heavy chain gene in Drosophila which does not cluster with any of the three human isoforms (Va, b, and c) in a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1B). Rather, it is a distinct entity whose evolution diverged probably from the common ancestor of vertebrate myosin V; however, we have not found any major divergence in the well conserved regions of the motor domain. The mRNA of DmV is abundant in the fly through all developmental stages, as has been reported previously (19Bonafe N. Sellers J.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, DmV seems to participate in vesicle transport just as other myosin V does. 2J. Tóth, M. Kovács, F. Wang, L. Nyitray, and J. R. Sellers, unpublished data. 2J. Tóth, M. Kovács, F. Wang, L. Nyitray, and J. R. Sellers, unpublished data.We have studied two naturally occurring splice variants of DmV which differ only in a highly charged, 8-amino acid insert in the so-called loop 2 region (Fig. 1C). Loop 2 is a flexible structural element at the actin binding surface of the myosin motor domain, which is thought to be involved in actin binding through ionic interactions (20Furch M. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6317-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Joel P.B. Trybus K.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our current findings are in line with those of others in that the net charge of loop 2 alters the affinity of myosin for actin (in all nucleotide states) but does not profoundly change its kinetic pattern. From our present study, the main characteristics of the DmV ATPase cycle are (i) a rapid but energetically unfavored ATP hydrolysis step (equilibrium constant < 1); (ii) rapid product release; and (iii) low thermodynamic coupling between actin and ADP binding to DmV. These properties together make it a low duty ratio myosin (i.e. it spends a small fraction of its cycle time bound strongly to actin), in contrast to vertebrate myosin Va. Consistent with this, we also found in in vitro motility assays that double-headed DmV constructs exhibit the characteristics of low duty cycle (nonprocessive) motors that require a high myosin surface density to support movement of actin filaments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification of the DmV S1 and HMM Proteins—We used the myosin V cDNA from Drosophila melanogaster (19Bonafe N. Sellers J.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to create subfragment 1 (S1-1IQ, truncated at amino acid Gly-803), which comprises the motor domain plus one light chain binding motif. We have also engineered double-headed heavy meromyosin-like (HMM) fragments that are composed of the motor and the full light chain binding domains followed by a short coiled-coil region to dimerize (truncated at amino acid Ser-1100). Fragments were subcloned into pFast-bac1 (Invitrogen) baculovirus transfer vector that already contained the sequence of a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) downstream from the chosen cloning sites (C-terminal in the protein). We identified a splice variant of DmV bearing an 8-amino acid insert in loop 2 from expressed sequence tag data bases. We amplified and sequenced the inserted region from fly RNA. The insert (QGNDTRRR) was then introduced into the S1 and HMM sequences by QuikChange II XL mutagenesis (Stratagene) (referred to as i-S1 and i-HMM). All DNA sequences used further for protein expression have been confirmed by sequencing. All constructs were coexpressed with Drosophila calmodulin (dCaM) and Drosophila cytoplasmic myosin light chain 1 (Mlc-c). The expressed proteins were first FLAG affinity purified as described previously (26Hu A. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46512-46517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), then concentrated and fractionated on a Mono Q ion exchange column with a linear gradient of 0.1-0.5 m NaCl using ÅKTAFPLC. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using skeletal muscle S1 or HMM of known concentration in the calibration curve.Identification of Light Chains—Small scale immune affinity purification of native myosin V from Drosophila was done using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody generated against the coiled-coil region of DmV and another peptide antibody targeting the globular tail region. Mass spectrometric analysis was done on in-gel digested peptide samples of Coomassie-stained bands in the 10-20-kDa regions.Reagents—Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared (27Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrene-iodoacetamide as described previously (28Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). ATP and ADP were of highest quality available (Roche Applied Science, 99.7% pure). N-Methylantranoyl derivatives of 2′-deoxy-ADP (dmantADP) and ATP (dmantATP) were generously provided by Dr. Howard White (Eastern Virginia Medical School) as well as the MDCC-labeled phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP) (29Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Other reagents were from Sigma.All experiments were carried out at 25 °C in SF50 buffer unless otherwise stated. SF50 comprises 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. I = 75 mm.Steady-state Actin-activated ATPase Measurements—ATPase activities were measured by an NADH-coupled, ATP-regenerating assay in SF50 buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 40 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 200 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 200 μm NADH. Changes in A340 (ϵ = 6,220 m-1 cm-1) were followed in a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. The ATPase activity of actin was reduced by stabilizing the actin filaments with superstoichiometric amounts of phalloidin (Calbiochem) and was subtracted from the actomyosin data.Acto-S1 Cosedimentation—Phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments were mixed with S1 in SF50 buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 200 units/ml pyruvate kinase. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge for 15 min at 100,000 rpm at 4 °C. Equal volumes of the supernatant and the resuspended pellets were run on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Coomassie-stained gels were digitized using a Kodak 440 Image Station, and the density data were quantified by Gaussian fits to the S1 bands to obtain the relative protein amounts.Fluorescence Spectra—Fluorescence spectra of pyrene-labeled actin were recorded using a FluoroMax 3 (Jobin Yvon) spectrofluorometer. Excitation spectra were recorded at 406 nm emission wavelength, and emission spectra were recorded by excitation of the fluorophore at 365 nm.In Vitro Motility Assay—The velocity of rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments gliding over DmV HMM and i-HMM was measured as described previously (30Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a buffer comprising 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mg/ml glucose, 2 μg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 0.7% methylcellulose at 30 °C.Stopped-flow Experiments—All measurements were done in an SF-2001 stopped-flow apparatus having a 2-ms dead time (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C in SF50 buffer. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and emission was selected with a bandpass filter having a peak in transmittance at 347 nm. dmantATP and dmantADP were excited via energy transfer from protein tryptophans (excitation at 280 nm), the emitted light was selected using a 400 nm long pass filter. Pyrene-actin was excited at 365 nm, and its signal was monitored through a 400-nm long pass filter.Pi dissociation from the acto-S1-products complex was followed as described previously (29Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). MDCC-PBP was excited at 436 nm, and the emitted light was selected with a 450 nm long pass filter. Experiments were done in a double mix mode with a syringe configuration of 5 ml (S1), 2 ml (ATP), 5 ml (actin). All syringes contained MDCC-PBP. All solutions and the stopped-flow apparatus were preincubated with a phosphate mop consisting of 0.02 unit/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 0.5 mm 7-methylguanosine to eliminate Pi contamination. Only plasticware was used for buffer and protein storage. Actin filaments were stabilized with phalloidin.Quenched-flow Experiments—Quenched-flow experiments were done as described earlier (31Wang F. Kovacs M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) except for the chemical quench being 1 m HCl instead of trichloroacetic acid.Data Analysis and Kinetic Simulation—OriginLab 7.0 (Microcal Corp.) and the KinTek SF-2001 software were used for data fitting. We performed kinetic simulations using the Gepasi version 3.21 software (32Mendes P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), which is freely available on the Internet (www.gepasi.org).RESULTSProtein Expression and Purification—We expressed double-headed HMM and single-headed S1 constructs as well as their loop 2 inserted forms (i-HMM, i-S1). HMM comprises the N-terminal motor domain, six light chain binding motifs (IQ motifs) and a coiled-coil region to allow dimerization of the two heavy chains. S1 contains the motor domain with only one IQ motif (S1-1IQ). Proteins were expressed in the Sf9/baculovirus system at 27 °C for 3 days in shaken cultures. We could obtain >95% pure protein preparations (Fig. 2) with a heavy chain to light chain stoichiometry of ∼1:1 for S1 and ∼1:6 for HMM. The typical yield was 1 mg of purified protein/109 cells.Fig. 2SDS-PAGE of recombinant DmV preparations. Lane 1, BenchMark protein marker (Invitrogen); lane 2, S1-1IQ (92.5 kDa) with dCaM (17 kDa); lane 3, HMM (128 kDa) with dCaM and dMlc-c (16.5 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Light Chains Associated with DmV—Drosophila has at least four non-muscle myosin light chain genes (33Yamashita R.A. Sellers J.R. Anderson J.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) whose products can potentially bind to the IQ motifs of the DmV heavy chain. We raised antibodies against the tail and the coiled-coil region of DmV and used them for both immunoprecipitation and immune affinity purification of DmV from Canton S flies. Using either of the antibodies and methods we could identify Mlc-c as a binding partner for myosin V, whereas no other non-muscle myosin light chains, including dCaM, were found (data not shown). However, when we coexpressed the HMM constructs with Mlc-c in Sf9 cells, CaM was also found associated with the purified protein (Fig. 2). This indicates that the DmV heavy chain bound endogenous CaM from the Sf9 cells and that the amount of heavy chain expression was limited by the endogenous CaM concentration of the insect cells. Thereafter we co-expressed both dCaM and Mlc-c with the heavy chain constructs. The HMM always associated with both light chains in an approximately equal stoichiometry, whereas the S1 constructs bound only dCaM (Fig. 2).Steady-state ATPase Activity—We measured the ATPase activities of S1, i-S1, HMM, and i-HMM by an NADH-coupled assay containing an ATP-regenerating system. In both splice variants actin activated the ATPase activity ∼100-fold reaching a Vmax of 13 s-1 in the noninserted S1 and HMM and 15-17 s-1 in the i-S1 and i-HMM constructs (Fig. 3A). Half-maximal actin activation (KATPase) occurred at ∼10 μm actin in the noninserted S1 and HMM at low salt concentration (I = 25 mm). Increasing the ionic strength to 75 mm by the addition of 50 mm KCl (all transient kinetic measurements were carried out in these conditions) resulted in a 2-fold increase in the KATPase of DmV S1 (19 μm). The loop 2-inserted constructs had ∼4-fold reduced KATPase values compared with the noninserted ones. Steady-state parameters are compiled in Table I.Fig. 3Steady-state solution properties.

Solid circles, S1 at 0 mm KCl (Vmax = 13.1 s-1, KATPase = 9.9 μm); triangles, S1 at 50 mm KCl (Vmax = 12.9 s-1, KATPase = 19.2 μm); solid squares, HMM (Vmax = 13.0 s-1, KATPase = 12.0 μm); open circles, i-S1 (Vmax = 17.6 s-1, KATPase = 4.4 μm); open squares, i-HMM (Vmax = 15.2 s-1, KATPase = 3.0 μm). B, steady-state actin attachment in 1 mm ATP was measured by actomyosin sedimentation. Solid circles, 2 μm S1; open circles, 2 μm i-S1. Acto-S1 containing pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate was centrifuged at 4 °C, pellets were resuspended in equal volumes of buffer, and supernatants (S) and pellets (P) were run on 4-20% SDS gel. Fractional attachments were obtained by densitometry. Points are the average of two experiments, error bars represent the S.D. Bands shown belong to one of the experiments with S1.

Open table in a new tab Steady-state Actin Attachment—S1 and i-S1 were sedimented with phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments in 1 mm ATP by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C. Free ADP concentration was kept to a minimum by using an ATP-regenerating system to maintain the steady-state distribution of intermediates such as in the ATPase assay. Fractional binding of S1 to actin was evaluated by densitometry after SDS-PAGE of the supernatants and pellets. Fig. 3B shows quadratic fits to the data with an apparent Kappd of 5 μm for S1. The additional charges in the loop 2 of i-S1 resulted in a 5-fold increase in the steady-state S1 affinity to actin (Kappd = 1 μm). The actin-bound S1 fraction represents a sum of the AM, AMT, AMDP, and AMD species in Scheme 1. Note that the experiments were carried out at 4 °C to reduce the ATPase activity of S1 to prevent depletion of ATP during the experiment.Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vitro Motility—We used double-headed HMM and i-HMM constructs to carry out in vitro actin gliding motility assays. These constructs have a motor domain with six light chain binding motifs per heavy chain and a coiled-coil stalk. Therefore, the length of their lever arm (light chain binding domain) is similar to that of vertebrate myosin V. Thus, if the kinetic parameters, most relevantly the rate constant of ADP release, are similar in mouse myosin Va and DmV, we expect to see a similar behavior in the in vitro motility assay. We observed a smooth movement of actin filaments by DmV in conditions where the HMM was applied to the nitrocellulose-coated surface in a relatively high concentration (0.2-0.3 mg/ml), and 0.7% methylcellulose was present in the flow cell. Under these conditions the actin gliding velocity of HMM in 1 mm ATP was 0.46 ± 0.10 μm/s, whereas the loop 2-inserted HMM moved actin filaments somewhat faster (0.65 ± 0.16 μm/s). Velocity distributions are shown in Fig. 4, and the data are summarized in Table I. Importantly, at low HMM concentration (0.1 mg/ml or less), where the surface density of HMM is low, actin filaments did not stay attached to the myosin-coated surface. Even at high HMM surface densities the presence of the viscosity-enhancing agent methylcellulose was necessary to maintain actin filament attachment. CaM addition into the flow cell did not change either the velocity or the actin binding behavior of the HMM. On the other hand, in the presence of Ca2+ no directional movement could be observed presumably because of the dissociation of dCaM from the myosin neck.Fig. 4Actin gliding motility. A, actin gliding velocity (v) distribution of DmV HMM in 1 mm ATP (v = 0.46 ± 0.1 μm/s, n = 98); B, in 0.4 mm dmantATP (v = 0.46 ± 0.08 μm/s, n = 244); C, i-HMM in 1 mm ATP (v = 0.65 ± 0.16 μm/s, n = 83). Motility assays were carried out at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also measured the actin gliding velocity of DmV HMM with dmantATP that we used as substrate in further transient kinetic experiments. We found no difference in velocity using the fluorescent ATP analog (Table I and Fig. 4B).ATP Binding and Hydrolysis in the Absence of Actin—DmV, as all other myosin Vs, has a tryptophan residue in the relay loop (Trp-494), which is known to be an intrinsic fluorescent sensor of the nucleotide state and the conformation of the nucleotide binding pocket (34Batra R. Manstein D.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Woolley R.J. Bagshaw C.R.

Upon mixing DmV S1 with substoichiometric ATP (single turnover conditions), a transient increase in the tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 295 nm, λem = 347 ± 25 nm) can be observed which is followed by a slower phase with reverse amplitude (Fig. 5A). The rate constants of the initial fast phase are ATP concentration-dependent and report ATP binding to S1, whereas the second phase represents the Pi release step that limits the basal ATPase cycle. The single turnover rate constant from single exponential fit to the second phase is 0.07 s-1, which is in good agreement with the single turnover rates we obtained with dmantATP when performing active site titrations (data not shown). The tryptophan signal was used to determine the second order rate constant of ATP binding to S1 in pseudo-first order conditions (Fig. 5B). Time courses followed single exponentials throughout the ATP concentration range, indicating that the signal change occurred solely between the MT and MDP states and the M → MT transition (Scheme 1) cannot be detected. Data could be fitted with a hyperbola. The maximal rate is only limited by the apparent ATP hydrolysis rate constant (k3 + k-3 = 68 ± 4.7 s-1). The initial slope gave a second order binding rate constant of 1.31 μm-1 s-1, which again agrees with the binding rate constants we obtained using dmantATP (data not shown).Fig. 5S1-nucleotide interaction. A, trace of single ATP turnover as reported by the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence signal of S1. Upon mixing 1 μm S1 with 0.5 μm ATP an ATP binding phase of increasing fluorescence and a slower phase of fluorescent decrease can be observed. A double exponential decay fits best to the data with kobs = 0.84 s-1 for the binding phase and kobs = 0.066 s-1 for the Pi release phase. Amplitudes of the two phases are similar and report a 7% change in tryptophan fluorescence. B, ATP binding to S1. 0.5 μm S1 was mixed with increasing concentrations of ATP. The binding phase of the resulting tryptophan fluorescence change was fitted with single exponentials. Points are the averages of 8-10 traces. Hyperbolic fit to the data yielded a maximum rate of kobs = 68 ± 5 s-1, which is limited by the hydrolysis step. C, ATP hydrolysis measured by quenched-flow. Time course of the reaction of 1 μm S1 with 0.625 μm ATP is shown. A double exponential fits best to the data and yields a burst amplitude of 0.14 mol of Pi/mol of S1 with a kobs = 1.9 s-1 (second phase kobs = 0.2 s-1). Inset, ATP hydrolysis in multiple turnover conditions upon mixing 1.9 μm S1 with 20 μm ATP. Data were fit with a single exponential burst followed by a linear steady-state phase yielding a burst amplitude of 0.36 mol of Pi/mol of S1 with a kobs of 19.2 s-1 and a steady-state rate of 0.08 s-1. D, dmantADP binding to S1. dmantADP was excited by energy transfer from tryptophans near the nucleotide binding site of S1. Rate constants of the reactions of 0.25 μm S1 with different concentrations of dmantADP were obtained from single exponential fits to the averages of 8-10 traces. Linear fit to the data yielded a second order binding rate constant of 2.2 μm-1 s-1 and an intercept of 37.9 s-1. Inset, time course on the reaction of 0.5 μm S1 and 50 μm dmantADP (premix) upon mixing with 0.5 mm ATP (postmix).

Previous data show that flow stimulates SHP2 translocation to cell membranes and binding to phosphotyrosine proteins. Flow-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation depends on SHP2 phosphatase activity and SHP2 binding to phospho-PECAM1 (platelet endothelial adhesion molecule 1), suggesting that SHP2 forms a signaling module with PECAM1. We hypothesized that flow induces assembly of the multi-protein complexes with SHP2 that are required for downstream signaling. ECs were exposed to flow for 10 min, and endogenous SHP2 was immunoprecipitated. SHP2-associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry. Tie2 and several known SHP2-binding proteins were identified in flow-induced SHP2 complexes. Flow significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both Tie2 and PECAM1 and their association with SHP2. To evaluate their functional roles, ECs were treated with Tie2 or PECAM1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Tie2 and PECAM1 expression decreased >80% after siRNA treatment, and flow-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was significantly inhibited by Tie2 and PECAM1 siRNA. Tie2 phosphorylation by flow was significantly inhibited by PECAM1 siRNA treatment. These results establish Tie2 transactivation via PECAM1 as an early event in flow-mediated mechanotransduction and suggest an important role for a PECAM1-SHP2-Tie2 pathway in flow-mediated signal transduction.

Recent data show that tyrosine-phosphorylated PECAM1 binds to the phosphatase SHP2 and that the PECAM1/SHP2 complex is required for activation of ERK1/2 by flow (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In addition to its phosphatase activity, SHP2 serves as a scaffold and binds to several membrane proteins, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (21Chen B. Bronson R.T. Klaman L.D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We reasoned that characterization of SHP2-binding proteins would reveal proteins that act as membrane sensors for downstream signaling. Using a proteomic approach, we found several known SHP2-associated membrane proteins and other adaptor proteins. Among these proteins we focused on Tie2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domain 2), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed predominantly on ECs and hematopoietic cells. Angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 are ligands for Tie2. Mice deficient in angiopoietin-1 and Tie2 show defective vascular development, demonstrating that Tie2 is crucial for vascular development (23Sato T.N. Tozawa Y. Deutsch U. Wolburg-Buchholz K.

A recent paper showed that flow increased Tie2 phosphorylation in ECs (25Lee H.J. Koh G.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we show that flow-induced Tie2 phosphorylation requires PECAM1 and that interactions among PECAM1, Tie2, and SHP2 mediate activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS by flow. Cell Culture and Flow Experiments—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were purchased from Clonetics and cultured in medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal clone III (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated as described previously (8Yan C. Takahashi M. Okuda M. Lee J.D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and maintained in Medium 200 (Cascade Biologics) with low serum growth supplement. Cells were used at passages 1-4. Experiments were performed with confluent cells grown in 60-mm dishes (growth-arrested for 1 day by serum deprivation) to decrease basal kinase activity. Cells were exposed to laminar flow (shear stress of 24 dyn/cm2) in a cone and plate viscometer. Antibodies—The SHP2 monoclonal antibody (B1), polyclonal antibodies (C18 and N16), the PECAM1 antibody, and ERK2 were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The phosphoserine 1179-eNOS antibody, phosphoserine 473-Akt, phospho-p44/42 ERK1/2, and the Akt antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. The eNOS antibody was from BD Biosciences. The phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and the Tie2 antibody were bought from Upstate Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4 and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma) and clarified by centrifugation. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with a specific antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to pull down the antibody complexes. Afterward, beads were washed with lysis buffer, and immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE. Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies. After washing and incubating with secondary antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biotechnology). Densitometric analyses of immunoblots were performed with Odyssey software (LI-COR Biotechnology). Identification of SHP2 Immune Complex Proteins by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins on the gel were visualized by Coomassie staining (Bio-Rad). The stained protein bands at molecular masses of ∼200, ∼150, and ∼100 kDa were excised and subjected to tryptic hydrolysis. Peptides were fixed as matrix and analyzed by using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (PF Biosystems VOYAGER System 4187). Data acquisition was computer-controlled using a program written in instrument control language that automatically provided data-dependent ion selection and varied capillary electrophoretic voltage. The partial mass spectrometry data for proteins identified as SHP2-associated proteins on the basis of correct molecular mass are presented in Supplemental Table I (available in the on-line version of this article), which provides protein names, molecular mass values, functions, accession numbers, and association with SHP2. PECAM1 and Tie2 siRNA and Transfection—Bovine (5′-GGAGGAACACAGAGAGAGUUAU-3′) and human (5′-GAAUUCUCGAGACCAGAAU-3′) PECAM1 siRNA were designed by our laboratory and made by Integrated DNA Technologies. Human Tie2 Smart Pool siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. Subconfluent BAECs were treated with 100 nm PECAM1 siRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 2 h, and then the siRNA was removed. Cells were incubated overnight and transfected with PECAM1 siRNA a second time. Cells were used for experiments 16 h after the second transfection. Subconfluent HUVECs were transfected with Tie2 siRNA as described for PECAM1, but transfection was performed once. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Where indicated, analysis of variance was performed, and p < 0.05 (indicated by an asterisk in Figs. 1, 3, 5, and 6) was considered significant in all experiments.Fig. 3Flow activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS was inhibited by Tie2 siRNA.

Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The interaction of SHP2 with these membrane proteins is essential for ERK1/2 activation by growth factors and mechanical force, such as flow (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that characterizing SHP2-associated proteins regulated by flow would identify novel mechanosensors involved in flow-mediated signaling. To elucidate components of the SHP2 signaling pathway, we used a proteomic approach based on co-precipitation of proteins interacting with SHP2. HUVECs were treated with flow for 10 min, and endogenous SHP2 was immunoprecipitated with three different antibodies (B1, C18, and N16; Fig. 1). We used antibodies that recognize different regions of SHP2, because some antibodies may compete with the binding site of SHP2-associated proteins or may not recognize SHP2 when bound to other proteins. We focused on phosphotyrosine proteins by immunoblotting with the monoclonal 4G10 antibody. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE showed several protein bands that co-precipitated with SHP2 and exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation in response to flow (Fig. 1A; from 220 to 97 kDa). We found that the B1 antibody, which recognizes the C terminus of SHP2, precipitated more proteins than the other two antibodies. Mouse IgG was used as a negative control to show specific B1 antibody immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, B and C). To identify these proteins the flow experiment was repeated, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the B1 SHP2 antibody, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands of 97-220 kDa were cut out of the gel and sent for sequence analysis by mass spectrometry. Known SHP2-associated proteins were identified in two major bands (see Supplemental Table I), namely 200-220 kDa (VEGFR2) and 120-150 kDa (Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder1), PECAM1, vascular endothelial cadherin, and Tie2). SHP2 was readily identified as the lowest band running at a slightly higher than expected mass of 80 kDa (Fig. 1A). We also identified several proteins not previously reported to bind SHP2 including, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K; 90 kDa), a protein kinase A anchoring protein (180 kDa), and a small GTPase-activating protein (90 kDa). Tie2 Interacts with SHP2 in Response to Flow—We decided to study the role of Tie2 in flow-induced SHP2 signaling because Tie2 was shown previously to be phosphorylated by flow (25Lee H.J. Koh G.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and it is known that Tie2 binds to SHP2 (26Jones N. Master Z. Jones J. Bouchard D. Gunji Y. Sasaki H. Daly R. Alitalo K. Dumont D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30896-30905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The interaction of Tie2 and SHP2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitating with the SHP2 antibody and immunoblotting with the Tie2 antibody (Fig. 2A). Although the Tie2 interaction with SHP2 was basally minimal, it was significantly increased at 5 min and sustained for 10 min (Fig. 2A, top). To confirm that Tie2 was activated by flow, BAECs were exposed to flow for different periods of time, and Tie2 was immunoprecipitated and its phosphorylation analyzed by immunoblot with 4G10 (Fig. 2B). Tie2 phosphorylation increased within 5 min and peaked at 10 min. The phosphorylation of Tie2 temporally corresponded with binding to SHP2 induced by flow. These results show that flow rapidly stimulates the phosphorylation of Tie2 that interacts with SHP2. Tie2 Is Required for Flow Stimulation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS—The Tie2 ligand, angiopoietin-1 has been shown to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, and ERK1/2 in ECs (27Fujikawa K. de Aos Scherpenseel I. Jain S.K. Presman E. Christensen R.A. Varticovski L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Kim I. Ryu Y.S. Kwak H.J. Ahn S.Y. Oh J.L. Yancopoulos G.D. Gale N.W. Koh G.Y. FASEB. J. 2002; 16: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although flow activates the same signaling pathways (25Lee H.J. Koh G.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the role of Tie2 in flow-mediated signaling remains uncharacterized. To address this question, we designed Tie2 siRNA to study the specific role of Tie2 in flow-induced ERK1/2 and Akt-eNOS pathways. After transfection with Tie2 siRNA for 1 day, Tie2 expression was reduced by >90%, whereas control siRNA had no significant effect (Fig. 3A). Tie2 siRNA had no significant effect on expression of ERK1/2, Akt, eNOS (Fig. 3B-D), or PECAM1 (data not shown). Treatment with Tie2 siRNA and control siRNA did not increase cell death or cause apparent changes in cell morphology (not shown). After siRNA transfection, HUVECs were exposed to flow for 10 and 20 min, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS was analyzed by immunoblots (Fig. 3, B-D). Phosphorylation of all proteins was significantly stimulated by flow (∼8-fold at 10 min) in cells treated with control siRNA. In contrast, phosphorylations of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS were significantly inhibited (50 ± 2.2, 40 ± 3.1, and 70 ± 1%, respectively) at 10 min in siRNA-treated cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 3, B--D). In contrast, flow-induced BMK1 activation (measured by band shift denoted by arrow in Fig. 3E) was not inhibited by Tie2 siRNA treatment. These results indicate that Tie2 is required for flow activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS. Flow Stimulates PECAM1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Interaction with SHP2—We next performed a series of experiments to define the specific role of PECAM1 in flow-stimulated SHP2-Tie2 interactions and the signaling pathway, because it is known that SHP2-PECAM1 interaction is required for ERK1/2 activation (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that flow induced PECAM1 tyrosine phosphorylation within 2 min that was sustained for 30 min (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In our experimental system we exposed HUVECs to flow (shear stress of 24 dyn/cm2) for 2-30 min and assayed PECAM1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PECAM1 association with SHP2 (Fig. 4). In response to flow, SHP2 associated with PECAM1 within 2 min and remained associated for 30 min (Fig. 4, top). Flow also rapidly stimulated PECAM1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4, middle) without change in PECAM1 expression (Fig. 4, bottom). PECAM1 Is Required for Flow Activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS—To confirm the importance of PECAM1 in the Tie2-SHP2 signaling pathway, we used siRNA to knock down PECAM1 expression specifically. We designed three PECAM1 siRNAs for bovine and one for human ECs. As shown in Fig. 5A, all PECAM1 siRNAs were highly effective at decreasing PECAM1 expression to <20% of normal levels, and siRNA number 3 was used for experiments (Fig. 5). The expression of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS was not changed by PECAM1 siRNA. The morphology of cells also remained unchanged after transfection with PECAM1 siRNA. For the experiments shown in Fig. 5, BAECs were pretreated with PECAM1 siRNA for 2 days followed by flow for 10 min. Flow-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS was significantly decreased (by 60 ± 9%, 39 ± 8%, and 68 ± 2%, respectively, with p < 0.05) after PECAM1 siRNA treatment (Fig. 5B; n = 4). Similar inhibition of phosphorylated ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS (by 54 ± 4, 52 ± 5, and 82 + 2%, respectively, with p < 0.05) were observed in HUVECs (Fig. 5C; n = 3). These results show that PECAM1 is required for flow-induced activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS, suggesting PECAM1 activation in the Tie2-SHP2 pathway. Tie2 Transactivation by Flow—To elucidate the hierarchy of the PECAM1-SHP2-Tie2 pathway, we next investigated whether Tie2 phosphorylation in response to flow required PECAM1. HUVECs were treated with PECAM1 siRNA and exposed to flow for 10 min. Tie2 phosphorylation was significantly decreased (52 + 9%, p < 0.05, n = 4) in PECAM1 siRNA-treated cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 6). These results show that Tie2 activation by flow is likely downstream of PECAM1-dependent signaling events. No direct binding between PECAM1 and Tie2 was observed using several antibodies for co-precipitation experiments, suggesting that SHP2 may act as an adaptor for these two proteins. The major findings of the present study define a new mechanotransducing pathway by which flow activates ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS in endothelial cells. Specifically, by using proteomics and siRNA knockdown strategies we found that flow stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM1, promoting SHP2 binding to PECAM1 and, subsequently, tyrosine phosphorylation of Tie2. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that PECAM1 is required for flow-induced Tie2 phosphorylation, establishing a novel pathway for Tie2 activation. The present results, combined with previous work from our laboratory (29Jin Z.G. Ueba H. Tanimoto T. Lungu A.O. Frame M.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and others (12Shay-Salit A. Shushy M. Wolfovitz E. Yahav H. Breviario F. Dejana E. Resnick N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9462-9467Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) showing activation of VEGFR2 by flow, demonstrate that the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases is an important mechanism for mechanotransduction. An unanswered question is how flow activates Tie2 and VEGFR2. Three non-exclusive mechanisms appear likely. First, flow may inhibit the activity of a phosphatase that normally keeps Tie2 and VEGFR2 inactive. A possible mechanism would be localized generation of reactive oxygen species (especially H2O2) that inhibit tyrosine phosphatases by oxidizing the cysteine present in the catalytic site. This mechanism has been shown to mediate propagation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (30Reynolds A.R. Tischer C. Verveer P.J. Rocks O. Bastiaens P.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and SHP2 cysteine oxidation has been specifically shown to be involved in platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling (31Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). This mechanism seems likely, because proteins that immunoprecipitated with SHP2 (a tyrosine phosphatase) paradoxically exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation in response to flow (see Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that SHP2 phosphatase activity was inhibited. Second, flow may promote clustering of Tie2 and VEGFR2 with amplification of signaling by autophosphorylation, as was also shown for the epidermal growth factor receptor (32Ichinose J. Murata M. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Receptor clustering could be enhanced by association with scaffold proteins such as Gab1 (or perhaps SHP2). Finally, SHP2 may play a direct role as suggested by the finding that SHP2 increases Src activity by controlling phosphorylation of Csk, a negative regulator of Src (33Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The third mechanism requires activation of SHP2, which logically must occur in a different location or at a different time than that for the inactivation of SHP2 discussed in the first mechanism. In fact, Fujiwara and colleagues (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) have previously shown a requirement for SHP2 activity in flow-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Thus, we propose that SHP2 initially functions as a scaffold to activate Tie2 at the membrane, whereas SHP2 subsequently functions as a phosphatase to mediate downstream signal events such as ERK1/2 activation. An important finding in the present study is the stimulation of PECAM1 and SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation by flow. Although PECAM1-SHP2 interaction exists prior to the initiation of flow, there is a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both PECAM1 and SHP2 in response to flow. Previously, we found that detectable amounts of SHP2 and Gab1 were translocated from the cytoplasm to the EC junction in response to flow (13Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that flow stimulates both SHP2 translocation and activation of a kinase that can phosphorylate both SHP2 and PECAM1. Previous studies of PECAM1 have suggested that the Fer kinase is an important PECAM1 kinase (34Kogata N. Masuda M. Kamioka Y. Yamagishi A. Endo A. Okada M. Mochizuki N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3553-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) because it specifically phosphorylates PECAM-1 at the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. Fer also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 and Gab1 (34Kogata N. Masuda M. Kamioka Y. Yamagishi A. Endo A. Okada M. Mochizuki N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3553-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The present study defines novel roles for PECAM1 and Tie2 in flow-mediated mechanotransduction. Although it was previously shown that PECAM1 mediated ERK1/2 activation, the role of PECAM1 in Akt and eNOS activation is novel. Pertinent to our data is a recent report that eNOS binds to PECAM1, although the interaction was reported to inhibit eNOS activity (35Dusserre N. L'Heureux N. Bell K.S. Stevens H.Y. Yeh J. Otte L.A. Loufrani L. Frangos J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More intriguing is the role of Tie2 in EC mechanotransduction. We found that Tie2 siRNA did not affect PECAM1 expression, indicating that the decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS by Tie2 knockdown was not due to decreased PECAM1 expression. Based on these data, the most likely flow-activated mechanosignaling pathway appears to be PECAM1 to SHP2 to Tie2. Physiologically, Tie2 activation by flow is likely to provide a tonic survival signal based on the well established data showing that both Tie2 and flow protect EC from apoptotic stimuli (36Pi X. Yan C. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 37Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The fact that both Tie2 and VEGFR2 are transactivated by flow may also be important in angiogenesis and EC migration. It is therefore attractive to speculate that changes in blood flow may regulate the activity and the subcellular location of these receptors. Because PECAM1 also binds β-catenin and γ-catenin and because the catenins bind vascular endothelial cadherin (38Ilan N. Mahooti S. Rimm D.L. Madri J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3005-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that flow may target Tie2 to cell junctions as suggested for the VEGFR2 by Shay-Salit et al. (12Shay-Salit A. Shushy M. Wolfovitz E. Yahav H. Breviario F. Dejana E. Resnick N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9462-9467Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This would be an ideal location for controlling the local signaling required for cell locomotion, because actin filament formation is highly regulated at cell junctions. Future studies will be required to define the specific roles of the Tie2 and VEGFR2 pathways in flow-mediated signal transduction. We thank Drs.

It is composed by two moieties; (i) a core complex, binding chromophores involved in charge separation and electron transport; (ii) an antenna system (LHCI) responsible for increasing the absorption cross-section. In higher plants the core complex is composed of 14 subunits (1Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Knoetzel J. Mant A. Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and it binds about 100 Chl a and 22 β-carotene molecules (3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar, 4Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The four major polypeptides of higher plant LHCI are encoded by the nuclear genes Lhca1-4 (4Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 5Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Two other Lhca genes, Lhca5 and Lhca6, have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana as well as in other plant species (5Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The Lhca5 polypeptide has been recently detected in thylakoids where it appears to be part of the PSI·LHCI supercomplex although in substoichiometric amounts (6Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Jansson S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Storf S. Stauber E.J. Hippler M. Schmid V.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9214-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Lhca6 open reading frame encodes a protein homologous to Lhca2, and it was assumed to be a pseudo-gene (5Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) although it might be expressed under specific conditions. 2F. Klimmek, submitted for publication. Thus, Lhca5 and Lhca6 seem to be only minor components of higher plant LHCI under standard laboratory growth, but they could play a role in specific environmental conditions. Recently, the structure of PSI·LHCI complex from Pisum sativum has been resolved by x-ray crystallography, showing the presence of one copy each of the Lhca1-4 polypeptides bound to one side of the PSI core (4Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The structure also revealed the presence of several chlorophyll molecules bound at the interface between antenna subunits and between LHCI and the PSI core complex, defined as “linker” and “gap” chlorophylls, respectively (4Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). This finding was rather unexpected, although it was known that selected pigment spectral forms in LHCI depend on the direct contact between two subunits (8Bossmann B. Knoetzel J. Jansson S. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 52: 127-136Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The fractionation of the PSI·LHCI complex into antenna and core moieties allowed for the isolation of an interfacial pigment pool composed by Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoid molecules (10Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The analysis of plants lacking individual Lhca proteins is also consistent with the location of Chls in between protein subunits (11Klimmek F. Ganeteg U. Ihalainen J.A. van Roon H. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LHCI subunits form dimers, as suggested by the in vitro reconstitution of Lhca1 with Lhca4 (9Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and by the dimeric aggregation state of native LHCI, including Lhca2 and Lhca3 (12Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Composition of PSI·LHCI preparations from Lhca mutants is also consistent with Lhca1 interacting with Lhca4 and Lhca2 with Lhca3 (11Klimmek F. Ganeteg U. Ihalainen J.A. van Roon H. Jensen P.E.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this work the association of LHCI polypeptides to PSI core was analyzed. The biochemical analysis of a set of plants lacking each individual Lhca1-5 gene products showed that the interaction between Lhca subunits and PSI core is strongly cooperative. In fact, when one subunit is missing, the whole LHCI system is de-stabilized. On this basis, protein-protein interactions mediated by gap pigments are suggested to play an important role in LHCI binding to PSI core. Gap pigments were also spectroscopically characterized, evidencing their involvement in specific pigment-pigment interactions and their influence on red forms. Plant Material and Thylakoids Purification—The A. thaliana plants used in this study lack individual Lhca1-5 proteins (Δa1-a5) and were obtained after T-DNA insertion (Δa1, Δa4, and Δa5) or antisense RNA inhibition (Δa2 and Δa3) in the Colombia background (WT col-0), as described before (13Ganeteg U. Strand A. Gustafsson P. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Ganeteg U. Kulheim C. Andersson J. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Growth of plants and isolation of thylakoids from dark-adapted plants was as in Haldrup et al. (15Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Purification of Photosystem I Particles and LHCI—Non-denaturing Deriphat-PAGE was performed following the method developed by Peter and Thornber (16Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications; the stacking gel had 3.5% (w/v) acrylamide (38:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). The resolving gel had an acrylamide concentration gradient from 4.5 to 11.5% (w/v) stabilized by a glycerol gradient from 8 to 16% (w/v). 12 mm Tris and 48 mm glycine, pH 8.5, were also included in both gels. Thylakoids, at a Chl concentration of 1 mg/ml, were solubilized with an equal volume of 1.2 or 2% α- and β-DM, respectively (Anatrace©, Maumee, OH). Thus, final concentrations of, respectively, Chls and α and β-DM were 0.5 mg/ml and 0.6 and 1%. Solubilized thylakoids were vortexed for 1 h, left for 10 h in ice and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 h to pellet the unsolubilized material. 30 μg of chlorophylls were loaded per each gel lane. Purification of PSI·LHCI particles from thylakoids was performed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation upon solubilization of membranes with 1% β-DM as described in Croce et al. (17Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8572-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). PSI core and LHCI moieties were dissociated through a further solubilization with β-DM and zwittergent (18Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17255-17360Google Scholar). Lhc monomers, dimers, and trimers, fractions were concentrated, reloaded on a 0.1-1 m sucrose gradient, and centrifuged in a SW60 Beckman rotor for 16 h at 55,000 rpm for further fractionation. Spectroscopy and Pigment Analysis—The absorption spectra were recorded using a SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer, in 5 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 0.2 m sucrose, and 0.03% β-DM. The CD spectra were measured at 10 °C on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter. The chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio and Chl a/b ratio were independently measured by fitting the spectrum of acetone extracts with the spectra of individual purified pigments (19Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and by HPLC analysis as in Gilmore and Yamamoto (20Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed as in Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) but was optimized for the separation of Lhca1-4 from A. thaliana (10Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by using an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 75:1 and a total concentration of acrylamide plus bisacrylamide of 4.5 and 15.5% for the stacking and running gel, respectively, with 6 m urea incorporated in the running gel. For gel staining, 0.05% Coomassie R in 25% isopropanol, 10% acetic acid was used to improve signal linearity with protein amount (22Ball E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional separation was performed using non-denaturing Deriphat PAGE in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second; gel slices were equilibrated in 7 m urea, 2% SDS, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 30 h before loading. After SDS-PAGE, polypeptides were transferred into a nitrocellulose membrane (Sartorious AG, Gottingen Germany) using a blot system from Bio-Rad. Detection of the various Lhca polypeptides with specific antibodies was performed as described in Jansson et al. (23Jansson S. Stefansson H. Nyström U. Gustafsson P. Albertsson P.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 297-309Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Stoichiometry Evaluations Based on Coomassie Stain Quantification—The protein amount was evaluated after SDS-PAGE by determining the amount of Coomassie stain bound to each band by colorimetry, as described (10Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The gel image was acquired by using a Bio-Rad GS710 scanner. The picture was then analyzed with Gel-Pro Analyzer© software, which quantifies the staining of the bands as IOD (optical density integrated on the area of the band). Reconstitution in Vitro of Lhca1-4 Monomeric Complexes—cDNAs of Lhca1-4 from A. thaliana (12Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were expressed and isolated from the SG13009 strain of Escherichia coli following a protocol previously described (25Nagai K. Thøgersen H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 26Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kuhlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Reconstitution in vitro of Arabidopsis Lhca1-4 was performed as in Croce et al. (12Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Three Distinct PSI Populations Can be Separated by Non-denaturing PAGE—Plants depleted in individual Lhca polypeptides are a very useful tool for the analysis of the antenna association to PSI core (11Klimmek F. Ganeteg U. Ihalainen J.A. van Roon H. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Ganeteg U. Strand A. Gustafsson P. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, the effect of the depletion of individual Lhca polypeptides on pigment binding complexes was analyzed by non-denaturing PAGE electrophoresis; thylakoids from WT and Δa1-a5 plants were solubilized under very mild conditions (0.6% α-DM) and fractionated by non-denaturing Deriphat-PAGE (16Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the lack of Lhca polypeptides has no detectable effects on Photosystem II subunits, which separate in several bands ranging from monomeric Lhcb to PSII·LHCII supercomplexes. In fact, as shown in Fig. 1, the band profile from ΔLhca plants was very similar to WT but for the region corresponding to PSI·LHCI in the upper part of the gel. A close-up of this gel region is shown in Fig. 2A. In WT plants, only one major PSI·LHCI band is present, whereas in Lhca-deficient plants up to three bands could be resolved. To characterize these populations with different apparent size, we ran a second dimension on SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions that enabled the separation of the component polypeptides of each green band (not shown; however, see Fig. 3 for the same kind of separation from β-maltoside-solubilized samples). The slowest migrating bands in the first dimension correspond to the complete PSI·LHCI complex with the four Lhca1-4 polypeptides. The fastest green bands instead correspond to the PSI core with no LHCI polypeptides left bound. The bands with intermediate mobility (indicated as PSI·LHCI*, consisted of PSI with a reduced antenna complement.Fig. 2Non-denaturing gel profiles of thylakoids purified from WT and Δa1-a5 plants, particularly of Photosystem I region. Thylakoids have been solubilized with final 0.6% α-DM (A) or 1% β-DM (B) before loading, and 30 μg of Chls have been loaded in each lane. Three different PSI bands have been identified by a second denaturing electrophoresis to be, respectively, PSI with full antenna (PSI·LHCI), PSI with reduced antenna (PSI·LHCI*), and PSI without any antenna polypeptide (PSI-core).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE of PSI bands from WT and Δa1-a5 plants (particular of region concerning Lhca polypeptides). Gel regions containing PSI complexes from the first dimension separation Deriphat PAGE (shown on the top) were loaded on denaturing SDS-PAGE. On the left, the mobility of individual Lhca polypeptides as resolved in the lane loaded with PSI·LHCI complex from WT is indicated. Vertical lines indicates the position of PSI·LHCI* complexes in the first dimension. Symbols indicates the positions of residual Lhca and psaD polypeptides in PSI·LHCI* complexes from mutants as follows: , Lhca1, Lhca4; ◃, Lhca2, Lhca3; ○, PsaD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A band corresponding to the PSI core was detected in all Δa1-a4 plants but not in WT under these solubilization conditions. This suggests that, when an individual Lhca polypeptide is lacking, PSI·LHCI supercomplex stability is affected, and a large fraction of PSI particles completely loses its LHCI moiety. In Δa4 plants, the band corresponding to the PSI core is the most represented, indicating a severe destabilization of LHCI in these plants, consistent with the small PSI antenna size detected in these plants (11Klimmek F. Ganeteg U. Ihalainen J.A. van Roon H. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Instead, in Δa1 plants the main band corresponded to unaffected PSI·LHCI as in WT, whereas in Δa2 and Δa3 plants a band of PSI·LHCI* was the most abundant. The pattern of Δa5 plants was very similar to the one from WT, and only very minor differences could be detected. In Fig. 2A, additional faint bands can be recognized in the different samples; by two-dimensional analysis these could be identified as co-migrating PSII supercomplexes that are partially retained with the very mild solubilization conditions used. Solubilization with 1% β-DM is a slightly harsher treatment, and it completely dissociates PSII supercomplexes but does not affect PSI·LHCI WT, as shown in Fig. 2B (17Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8572-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 27Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The same PSI bands identified upon solubilization with 0.6% α-DM are detected after solubilization with β-DM as well, but now they are cleared from the interfering PSII·LHCII bands. Nevertheless, their relative intensities are modified by the stronger solubilization treatment. In Δa1 plants, the three band classes were all detectable; PSI with a full antenna complement (PSI·LHCI), PSI core, and PSI·LHCI*, consistent with the fact that these plants retain a residual level of Lhca1, and thus, a fraction of WT PSI·LHCI is still present (14Ganeteg U. Kulheim C. Andersson J. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Instead, in Δa2 and Δa3 plants only bands corresponding to PSI core and PSI·LHCI* were visible. The amount of PSI·LHCI* is clearly decreased upon solubilization with β-DM as compared with the pattern with α-DM, thus suggesting that PSI·LHCI* is susceptible to detergent treatment and that, with β-DM, a larger part dissociates into PSI core and free Lhca components. In Δa4 plants the main band is again the PSI core, as previously shown with α-DM solubilization, but a weak band corresponding to PSI·LHCI* is still visible. Even if the pattern obtained from Δa5 plants is very similar to that obtained from WT, the amount of the faint bands with higher mobility (PSI·LHCI* and PSI core) is slightly higher when compared with the WT. This difference might indicate that the absence of Lhca5 affects at least a small fraction (maximum 5%) of PSI particles. To analyze the polypeptide composition of green bands from Deriphat PAGE we ran a second dimension on a denaturing SDS-PAGE. In Fig. 3, a detail of the part involving antenna polypeptides is shown. The gel system used here as the second dimension has been previously shown to be able to separate each Lhca1-4 polypeptide from the others (10Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The identification of Lhca1-4, based on gel mobility and confirmed by antibodies detection (not shown), is reported on the left. One PSI core subunit, PsaD, is also detected in the same region of the gel and was used as a reference for the PSI core. With this analysis, we could identify the polypeptides contained into the three classes of PSI bands described on Deriphat-PAGE, allowing the identification of the PSI·LHCI* band as a PSI complex with a reduced Lhca content. Moreover, although the two-dimensional resolution was not excellent due to some interference with non-ionic detergents used in the first dimension, we could also obtain information on the identity of the Lhca polypeptide retained in PSI·LHCI* from different mutant plants. In fact, in PSI·LHCI* from Δa2 and Δa3, the main bands corresponded to Lhca1 and Lhca4, whereas only Lhca2 and Lhca3 were retained in PSI·LHCI* from Δa4. The Δa1 profile is instead less clear due to the presence of the residual PSI·LHCI with full antenna. Despite this limit, however, these results suggest a reciprocal dependence of Lhca2 and Lhca3 (and Lhca1 and -4) for their stable binding to the PSI core. LHCI Binding Stability Is Reduced in Plants Depleted in Lhca1-4 Polypeptides—We noted above that the PSI·LHCI* green band in Δa2 and Δa3 plants is susceptible to detergent treatment since its abundance is reduced under stronger solubilization conditions, whereas the amplitude of the PSI core band is increased. This effect should correspond to a release of Lhca from PSI upon β-DM solubilization. To verify this hypothesis, we performed a sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of thylakoids membranes solubilized with 1% β-DM (Fig. 4B). The dissociated Lhca proteins should migrate in the upper part of the gradients together with the antenna complexes of PSII. To detect their presence, we analyzed the corresponding fractions (bands B2, B2-3, and B3) by Western blotting using specific antibodies against Lhca1-4 polypeptides (Fig. 4A). The presence of Lhca2 and -3 is detected in both Δa1 and Δa4 plants, suggesting that a fraction of these polypeptides is detached from the PSI core upon solubilization. Symmetrically, Lhca1 and -4 are found in the upper band from both Δa2 and Δa3 plants. It is worth noting that, instead, in WT plants Lhca are stably retained bound to PSI in these solubilization conditions. Instead, quite surprisingly, Δa5 plants showed a release of Lhca2 and Lhca4 polypeptides. It is also interesting to determine whether Lhca polypeptides are released from PSI individually as monomers or dimers. To this aim we collected the hypothetical dimeric Lhc population (B2-3 in Fig. 4B) and loaded it into a second sucrose gradient for a longer separation time to increase resolution; as an example, the result in the case of Δa2 plants is shown in Fig. 4C. A band with an intermediate mobility between monomeric and trimeric Lhcb was resolved. Although it was not completely pure, this fraction contained dimeric Lhca complexes, as detected by the presence of a red absorption tail at wavelengths >700 nm, a spectroscopic fingerprinting of PSI antenna complexes (not shown). This finding confirms that a secondary loss of LHCI polypeptides is induced when one Lhca is missing and also shows that the Lhca polypeptides are lost as dimers, thus confirming their capacity of interacting with each other within Lhca2/3 and Lhca1/4 pairs. Lhca Protein Stoichiometries in the Different Complexes—The sucrose gradient centrifugation after 1% β-DM solubilization of WT and mutant thylakoids also allowed the isolation of PSI particles (B5 in Fig. 4). This separation method, however, has lower resolution with respect to the non-denaturing green gels seen above, so that PSI complexes with reduced antenna complement (PSI·LHCI*) cannot be fully separated from the PSI core (or PSI·LHCI). In an attempt to increase the purity of this complex, we harvested several fractions from band 5 (in Fig. 4) and analyzed them by green gel electrophoresis. The fast migrating part of band 5 was shown to be enriched in PSI·LHCI* with little PSI core contamination. This fraction was used for all further analyses of PSI particles presented below. The presence of the Lhca polypeptides in these particles was first detected with immunoblotting with specific antibodies (not shown). This analysis showed a general reciprocal dependence between the presence of Lhca1 and Lhca4 on one hand and Lhca2 and Lhca3 on the other hand, in full agreement with the previous work performed on PSI particles from the same Arabidopsis lines (11Klimmek F. Ganeteg U. Ihalainen J.A. van Roon H. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and with all results presented above. In addition, Western blotting detected residual amounts of Lhca3 left in Δa2 PSI particles and vice versa, in apparent contradiction with the above exposed dimeric state of Lhca polypeptides. To interpret these results, however, it must be considered that immunoblotting is a very sensitive technique for polypeptides detection, but the linearity range of the signal is limited, and stoichiometric relationships between different polypeptides cannot be determined with accuracy. For a more accurate quantitative evaluation we, thus, also determined the Lhca polypeptide content by measuring the amount of Coomassie Blue bound to each Lhca1-4 band after SDS-PAGE separation of PSI particles, as in Ballottari et al. (10Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). The amount of each Lhca was then related to the amount of PsaD and PsaF, two polypeptides that we used as internal standards for the quantification of PSI core. Based on the known stoichiometry of one copy of each Lhca1-4 per PSI core (4Ben Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 10Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we calculated the amount of Lhca polypeptides per PSI core present in each preparation (Fig. 5B). In Δa1 plants, Lhca1 and Lhca4 are reduced to 35-40%, whereas ∼60% of Lhca2 and Lhca3 is retained. This means that ∼40% of PSI population without Lhca1 retains Lhca2 and Lhca3. The absence of Lhca2 and Lhca3 causes a similar destabilization, and in fact in Δa2 and Δa3 plants, about 40% of Lhca1 and Lhca4 is found, whereas Lhca2 and Lhca3 are below the detection limit for Coomassie stain. The Lhca2 and Lhca3 polypeptides detected with antibodies in Δa3 and Δa2 PSI, thus, should be considered as trace amounts. In Δa4 plants, around 10% of Lhca2 and Lhca3 are retained whereas Lhca1 and Lhca4 are completely absent. Instead, in Δa5 plants PSI antenna content is 96% of the WT, but this difference is not significant since it is under the experimental error of the quantification. These data suggest two main conclusions; first, in PSI·LHCI* from the different plants Lhca1-4 and Lhca2-3 were always found in similar amounts. This illustrates the reciprocal dependence of each member of these two couples from the companion for the association to PSI core. Therefore, when one polypeptide is absent, its partner is not found associated to PSI core in significant amounts. Second, the absence of one polypeptide affects the binding stability of all the others, although to a different extent. Thus, the whole LHCI system is affected by the lack of each single Lhca. Biochemical Properties of PSI Particles—PSI particles from each genotype, purified as described in the previous paragraph, were also analyzed for their pigment content, with a combined approach of HPLC analysis and fitting of the acetone extracts spectra with the spectra of individual pigments. The results are summarized in Table I. In PSI from Δa2, Δa3, and Δa4, a significant decrease of the Chl b content was observed, as reported in Klimmek et al. (11Klimmek F. Ganeteg U. Ihalainen J.A. van Roon H. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Jansson S. Biochemistry. 2005; 4"
https://openalex.org/W1985493305,"Although nicotine has been suggested to promote lung carcinogenesis, the mechanism of its action in this process remains unknown. The present investigation demonstrates that the treatment of rat lung epithelial cells with nicotine for various periods differentially mobilizes multiple intracellular pathways. Protein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-OH-kinase are transiently activated after the treatment. Also, Ras and its downstream effector ERK1/2 are activated after long term exposure to nicotine. The activation of Ras by nicotine treatment is responsible for the subsequent perturbation of the methotrexate (MTX)-mediated G1 cell cycle restriction as well as an increase in production of reactive oxygen species. When p53 expression is suppressed by introducing E6, persistent exposure to nicotine enables dihydrofolate reductase gene amplification in the presence of methotrexate (MTX) and the formation of the MTX-resistant colonies. Altering the activity of phosphoinositide 3-OH-kinase has no effect on dihydrofolate reductase amplification. However, the suppression of protein kinase C dramatically affects the colony formation in soft agar. Thus, our data suggest that persistent exposure to nicotine perturbs the G1 checkpoint and causes DNA damage through the increase of the production of reactive oxygen species. However, a third element rendered by loss of p53 is required for the initiation of the process of gene amplification. Under p53-deficient conditions, the establishment of a full oncogenic transformation, in response to long term nicotine exposure, is achieved through the cooperation of multiple signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2081110690,"Given the modulation of iron metabolism by hypoxia and the high iron requirement of neoplastic cells, we investigated iron metabolism in a human renal cancer cell line with a mutated von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene (RCC10) and in a transfectant clone with wild-type VHL (RCC63). The loss of VHL strongly up-regulated transferrin receptor expression in RCC10 cells as a result of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-mediated transcriptional activation, leading to an increased uptake of transferrin-bound 55Fe. Increased iron availability did not compromise the resistance of VHL-defective cells to oxidative stress or promote faster cell multiplication. Surprisingly, the content of ferritin H and L subunits and ferritin mRNA levels were considerably lower in the RCC10 than in the RCC63 cells. Despite the similarities between HIF-1 and iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), we found no evidence of specific regulation of IRP2 by VHL. However, both IRP2 and IRP1 were slightly activated in RCC10 cells, thus indicating that this cell line has a somewhat reduced labile iron pool (LIP). The finding that RCC10 cells had a lower ferritin content but more ferritin-associated 55Fe than RCC63 explains why VHL-lacking cells may have a smaller LIP despite increased iron uptake. We also found a correlation between cytoprotection from iron-mediated damage and efficient incorporation into ferritin of both transferrin and non-transferrin-bound 55Fe. This study shows that, like oncogene activation, the loss of an oncosuppressor rearranges the expression pattern of the genes of iron metabolism to increase iron availability. However, in the case of VHL loss, mechanisms affecting iron handling by ferritin somehow counteract the effects that the reduced content of this protective protein may have on proliferation and oxidant sensitivity.

However, in the case of VHL loss, mechanisms affecting iron handling by ferritin somehow counteract the effects that the reduced content of this protective protein may have on proliferation and oxidant sensitivity. Iron is an important cofactor needed for a number of essential cell functions, including cell growth (1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Cells need iron to proliferate mainly because ribonucleotide reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for DNA synthesis, is strictly iron-dependent, but recent evidence has suggested that other components of the cell division machinery, such as cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases, require iron (2Le N.T. Richardson D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1603: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Consequently, iron chelators have anti-proliferative effects as they lead iron-depleted cells to G1/S arrest and apoptosis (2Le N.T. Richardson D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1603: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, iron can also be dangerous as a catalyst of free radical reactions, because it can convert normally produced reactive oxygen species-like molecules formed by cellular metabolic activity into more potent hydroxyl radicals (3Cairo G. Recalcati S. Pietrangelo A. Minotti G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Accordingly, intracellular iron homeostasis is tightly regulated by the reciprocal expression of ferritin, a shell-shaped protein consisting of 24 subunits of two types that can safely store excess iron (4Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar), and transferrin receptor (TfR), 1The abbreviations used are: TfR, transferrin receptor; RCC, renal clear cell carcinoma; IRP1, -2, iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2; VHL, von Hippel Lindau; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; LIP, labile iron pool; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; DFO, desferrioxamine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; FAC, ferric ammonium citrate; HRE, hypoxia-responsive element; IRE, iron-responsive elements. which mediates iron entry into the cell. Although transcriptional regulation has been described, the concerted expression of ferritin and TfR is mainly controlled at post-transcriptional level by means of the action of iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2), cytoplasmic proteins that bind iron-responsive elements (IRE) in the untranslated regions of TfR and ferritin mRNAs in response to variations in iron levels in the so-called labile iron pool (LIP) (5Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 6Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). When activated, the IRPs enhance TfR mRNA stability and block ferritin mRNA translation, thus facilitating iron uptake over sequestration and generating a pool of iron for cellular metabolic use. Conversely, the down-modulation of IRP activity permits efficient ferritin synthesis and reduces TfR expression, thus preventing potentially toxic iron accumulation. The activity of IRP1 is regulated by interconversion between the RNA-binding form and a form endowed with a 4Fe-4S cluster that possesses aconitase enzymatic activity, whereas IRP2 activity is controlled at the level of protein stability, as it undergoes degradation by the proteasome in response to iron (5Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 6Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Given its importance for cell multiplication and its pro-oxidant capacity, iron could be a relevant factor in cancer development. In addition, understanding misregulations of iron metabolism in cancer cells may be important for improving chelation-based therapeutic strategies specifically targeted against tumor cells (7Kwok J.C. Richardson D.R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 42: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Information about specific changes affecting iron metabolism in tumors is rather scant, but there have been recent reports of alterations in the genes controlling intracellular iron concentrations, which may facilitate cell proliferation. For example, it has been shown that overexpression of the c-myc oncogene down-modulates H ferritin transcription while inducing the expression of IRP2, the cytoplasmic repressor of ferritin mRNA translation. It has therefore been hypothesized that this mechanism, which impairs ferritin synthesis at two different molecular levels, may be a means of increasing iron availability and useful for cell growth (8Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Like oncogene activation, the lack of an oncosuppressor may also affect iron metabolism in tumors. In particular, we hypothesized that iron homeostasis could be disrupted by the absence of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene product, a component of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex that targets the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) to proteasome degradation (9Kim W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In cells lacking protein VHL, the increased stabilization of the normally unstable HIF-1α leads to overproduction of hypoxia-inducible genes whose action is believed to facilitate tumor growth in adverse microenvironments, invasion, and angiogenesis (10Harris A.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 11Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 2003; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 12Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5371) Google Scholar, 13Denko N.C. Fontana L.A. Hudson K.M. Sutphin P.D. Raychaudhuri S. Altman R. Giaccia A.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Because iron is a cofactor required by the hydroxylases involved in HIF-1α degradation, the interaction of iron metabolism with VHL may be of interest in relation to the physiology of HIF-1 regulation and alterations of the system in cancer (11Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 2003; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Iron metabolism is modulated by hypoxia (6Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and we and others have demonstrated an HIF-1-dependent transcriptional activation of TfR expression in hepatoma cells exposed to hypoxia (14Tacchini L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4223-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of TfR and iron-related genes, as well as other parameters of iron metabolism, in a human renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) cell line that bears an inactivating mutation of the VHL gene (RCC10) and in a clone in which the wild-type VHL gene has been reintroduced by means of stable transfection (RCC63) (17Krieg M. Haas R. Brauch H. Acker T. Flamme I. Plate K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5435-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We found that the lack of VHL caused a profound rearrangement of iron homeostasis, not only activating TfR expression in a HIF-1-dependent manner and inhibiting ferritin expression at mRNA and protein level, but also modifying iron trafficking with preferential iron storage in ferritin that counterbalanced the enhanced TfR-mediated uptake. Cell Culture—The human parental VHL-negative RCC10 cell line and a clone derived by means of the stable transfection of VHL (RCC63) (17Krieg M. Haas R. Brauch H. Acker T. Flamme I. Plate K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5435-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Karl Plate (Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 ng/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For the RCC63 cells, G418 sulfate (Promega, Milano, Italy, 1 mg/ml) was added to the medium. The embryonic rat heart-derived cell line H9c2 was obtained from The American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1446) and grown as described previously (18Corna G. Santambrogio P. Minotti G. Cairo G. J.

When appropriate, near confluent cells were treated for 24 h with 100 μm ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), 100 μm desferrioxamine (DFO) or 100 μm CoCl2, 1 μm human holotransferrin (all from Sigma). Transient Transfection Assay—Subconfluent RCC cells were transiently co-transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) with 1 μg of a 50:1 mixture of the constructs containing fragments of the TfR promoter and the pRL-SV40 reporter vector containing Renilla luciferase, which was used to normalize transfection efficiency. The vectors used were pTfRB-luc, which contained a 455-bp fragment of the human TfR promoter region cloned in front of the luciferase gene in the pGL2 vector (Promega, Milano, Italy), pTfRBm-luc in which the bases TACGT in the putative HRE sequence 5′-TACGTGC-3′ were replaced with AATTC (14Tacchini L.

Cell Res. 2003; 290: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Dr. P. J. Ratcliffe). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. After 48 h, the cells were collected, washed, and lysed using the reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were then measured in a Promega luminometer using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblot Analysis—For the detection of IRPs and ferritin H subunit, the cells were homogenized in Munro buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors), and the lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. To detect TfR, the cells were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors, and the lysate was kept on ice for 40 min and then centrifuged at 16.000 × g for 5 min. HIF-1α was determined in nuclear extracts prepared according to a previous study (20Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Aliquots of supernatants containing equal amounts of proteins were electrophoresed in acrylamide-SDS gels and electroblotted to Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences). For ferritin H subunit analysis, extracts were resolved by means of non-denaturing PAGE (21Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). After assessing transfer by means of Ponceau S staining, the membranes were saturated in 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 30 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) containing 20% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 80, and incubated with rabbit antiserum to IRP2 (raised against a conserved sequence in the degradation domain of IRP2, 1:100 dilution) (18Corna G.

After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies and extensive washing with Trisbuffered saline containing Tween 80, the antigens were detected by chemiluminescence using an immunodetection kit (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantitated by laser densitometry. RNA-Protein Gel Retardation Assay—The cells were homogenized in Munro buffer; after the addition of dithiothreitol to a 1 mm final concentration, the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of supernatant proteins were incubated with a molar excess of the IRE probe transcribed from the linearized pSPT-fer plasmid containing the IRE of the human ferritin H chain using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP, and sequentially treated with RNase T1 and heparin as previously described (21Cairo G.

For the supershift experiments, the lysates were incubated with saturating amounts of mouse antiserum raised against recombinant human IRP1 (23Campanella A. Levi S. Cairo G. Biasiotto G. Arosio P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for 10 min at room temperature before being incubated with the IRE probe. After separation on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, the RNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by direct nuclear counting using an InstantImager (Packard Instruments Co.). Determination of Aconitase Activity—Aconitase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 240 nm, as described before (22Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428PubMed Google Scholar), by monitoring the disappearance of cis-aconitate. The incubation (1 ml of final volume) contained lysates (100 μg of protein) and 0.1 mm cis-aconitate in 0.3 m NaCl (pH 7.0), 37 °C; 1 milliunit is defined as the amount of enzyme that consumed 1 nmol of cis-aconitate/min. Northern Blot Analysis—Total cell RNA was isolated as described (24Pietrangelo A. Rocchi E. Casalgrandi G. Rigo G. Ferrari A. Perini M. Ventura E. Cairo G. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 802-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and equal amounts were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. To confirm that each lane contained equal amounts of total RNA, the ribosomal RNA content in each lane was estimated in the ethidium bromide-stained gels by laser densitometry. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N filters (Amersham Biosciences) that were hybridized with the following 32P-labeled DNA probes: human ferritin H and L subunit cDNAs (25Pietrangelo A. Casalgrandi G.

Cell Res. 1993; 206: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and the expressed sequence tag clone IMAGp956G0635Q24 encoding human IRP2 (RZPD Berlin, Germany). Quantitative determination was made by direct nuclear counting using an InstantImager (Packard Instruments Co.), and the values were calculated after normalization to the amount of ribosomal RNA. Determination of Ferritin Subunit Content—Ferritin concentrations were determined in cell lysates by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on monoclonal antibodies specific for human H and L ferritin subunits (rH02 and LF03) and calibrated with the corresponding recombinant homopolymers (27Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Biasiotto G. Arosio P. Blood. 2004; 103: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The specificity and absence of cross-reactivity of the antibodies have been previously described. The microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg of a monoclonal antibody specific for H or L ferritin. Soluble tissue homogenates or standard ferritins were diluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, and added to the plates. The presence of ferritin was revealed by incubation with the same antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Peroxidase activity was developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). Protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Uptake of 55Fe-Transferrin and 55Fe-FAC—To evaluate the incorporation of 55Fe-transferrin (Tf), the RCC cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin to remove cell-bound endogenous Tf. The cells were then washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the same medium containing 1 μm 55Fe-Tf. To label Tf with iron, 55Fe iron citrate was first prepared by mixing 55FeCl3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with citric acid in a 1:2 molar ratio. Human apo-Tf (Sigma) was incubated with 55Fe iron citrate in a buffer consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 μm Na2CO3 for 1 h at room temperature followed by removal of unincorporated 55Fe iron on YM 30 Centricon filter devices (Millipore). Preliminary experiments showed that this concentration of 55Fe-Tf was enough to allow linear iron incorporation under these conditions. Moreover, no significant incorporation of radioactivity was found when the cells were incubated at 4 °C (data not shown). To evaluate the incorporation of 55Fe-FAC, the cells were exposed for 24 h to 2 μCi/ml 55Fe-FAC prepared as described previously (28Corsi B. Cozzi A. Arosio P. Drysdale J. Santambrogio P. Campanella A. Biasiotto G. Albertini A. Levi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22430-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.2 mm ascorbic acid. When appropriate, the cells were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and further incubated for 24 or 48 h in serum-free medium plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin. At the end of the incubations, the medium was removed and saved, and the cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in the Munro lysis buffer used for the immunoblot analysis (see above). Aliquots of lysates were taken to measure the amount of cellular 55Fe uptake by means of liquid scintillation counting with Ultima Gold (Packard Instruments) and protein determination. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were taken for analysis of ferritin by autoradiography or immunoblotting. Analysis of 55Fe-labeled Ferritin—To evaluate 55Fe iron incorporation into ferritin, equal amounts of proteins prepared from cell lysates incubated with 55Fe-Tf or 55Fe-FAC were analyzed by means of non-denaturing PAGE followed by autoradiography and IstantImager counting (18Corna G. Santambrogio P. Minotti G. Cairo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13738-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Analysis of Cell Growth and Cytotoxicity—To evaluate cell proliferation, viable cells were counted using thiazolyl blue (MTT, Sigma) as an indicator of mitochondrial function. Briefly, RCC cells (105 cells per well) were seeded in quadruplicate in 24-well cell culture plates in the presence or in the absence of 1 μm Fe-Tf; at the indicated time points, the MTT solution was added for 2–3 h, the formazan crystals were dissolved according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the spectrophotometric absorbance was read at 570 nm with the background absorbance at 690 nm being subtracted. To monitor cytotoxicity, the cells were left untreated or exposed for 24 h to increasing concentrations of FAC or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (Sigma); the latter treatment was performed in the presence or in the absence of 1 μm Fe-Tf. At the end of the treatments, cell viability was measured by the MTT assay (18Corna G. Santambrogio P. Minotti G. Cairo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13738-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as described above. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as means ± S.D. The significance of differences was evaluated with the t test using the Stat View 4.0 program (Abacus Concept Inc., Berkeley, CA). Loss of VHL Activates TfR Expression and Iron Accumulation—Given our previous demonstration that TfR is a hypoxia-inducible gene (14Tacchini L. Bianchi L. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24142-24146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the absence of VHL influences TfR expression by using VHL-deficient RCC10 cells and the RCC63 clone stably transfected with wild-type human VHL (17Krieg M. Haas R. Brauch H. Acker T. Flamme I. Plate K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5435-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates normalized for actin content showed that the expression of TfR protein is more than three times higher in RCC10 cells (Fig. 1A). In agreement with previous evidence (17Krieg M. Haas R. Brauch H. Acker T. Flamme I. Plate K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5435-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), HIF-1α, which was barely detectable in RCC63 cells as a consequence of the forced expression of functional protein VHL, was clearly evident in RCC10 cells which lack VHL, thus demonstrating actual deregulation of the major VHL target (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the higher TfR expression also enhanced iron uptake, the cells were exposed to 55Fe-labeled transferrin, and the total cell content of radioactive iron was determined by means of liquid scintillation counting. The 55Fe content was >3-fold greater in the RCC10 cells, thus indicating that the enhanced levels of TfR are functionally involved in favoring greater iron availability (Fig. 1B). Competition by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled transferrin effectively blocked iron incorporation. Role of HIF-1 in TfR Induction—To understand the molecular basis of the higher TfR expression, we analyzed TfR mRNA levels. In agreement with the results provided by immunoblotting, Northern blot analysis showed a marked difference in steady-state TfR mRNA levels, with a 3-fold higher expression in RCC10 cells (Fig. 2A). To assess the role of HIF-1-mediated transcriptional regulation in the induction of TfR expression in VHL-defective RCC10 cells, the two RCC cell lines were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a 455-bp fragment of the human TfR promoter (wild-type or mutated in the hypoxia-responsive element, HRE) (Fig. 2B); this fragment has been previously demonstrated to be sufficient for the efficient transcription of a reporter gene (14Tacchini L. Bianchi L. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24142-24146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In line with our previous demonstration that TfR is activated by HIF-1 (14Tacchini L. Bianchi L. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24142-24146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 16Bianchi L. Tacchini L. Cairo G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4223-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the considerable difference in HIF-1 activity in the two cell lines, we found that the wild-type construct was transcribed three times more efficiently in the RCC10 than in the RCC63 cells, whereas no difference was found in the expression of the empty pGL2 basic vector. Importantly, the mutation in the HRE almost completely abolished the differences in transcription, thus demonstrating that the high level of TfR expression in RCC10 cells is caused by HIF-1-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 2C). Further evidence of the role of HIF-1 was provided by the greatly different expression of luciferase driven by a HRE multimer. When RCC63 cells were exposed to the hypoxia mimetic CoCl2, luciferase expression driven by the TfR promoter reached levels similar to those observed in RCC10 cells, in which expression was not significantly modified by the treatment (Fig. 2D). Increased Iron Accumulation Does Not Promote Oxidative Damage or Cell Proliferation—We next wondered what might be the consequences of this marked increased of iron content. Given the role of iron in promoting reactive oxygen species formation, we investigated whether RCC10 cells were more prone to undergo oxidative damage. To assess resistance to oxidative stress, the cells were exposed to the glutathione-depleting agent BSO, and their viability was monitored by MTT assay. Fig. 3A shows that the susceptibility to BSO of the two RCC cell lines was similar both in the presence and in the absence of the same concentration of diferric transferrin (1 μm) used in the iron incorporation experiments. This suggested that no excess iron remained available to promote free radical reactions. Similar results were obtained when the RCC cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of H2O2 (results not shown). On the contrary, an overload of iron (given as ferric ammonium citrate, FAC) greatly enhanced the susceptibility of H9c2 cardiomyocytes to BSO, thus showing that this assay is able to detect the presence of an excess of reactive iron (Fig. 3B). The high iron requirements of proliferating cells led us to suppose that the larger amount of iron entering RCC10 cells (which have lost a growth-suppressor gene) was used to promote faster multiplication rate, and so we compared the growth profiles of the"

At the G2/M transition, p73 is phosphorylated at Thr-86 by the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex; this is associated with its exclusion from condensed chromosomes and loss of DNA binding and transcriptional activation ability. Here we showed that p73 hypo-phosphorylated species reappear during mitotic exit, concomitant with p73 relocalization to telophase nuclei and recovered ability to activate transcription. Functional knock-out of p73 gene expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) alters mitotic progression, yielding an increase of ana-telophase cells, the accumulation of aberrant late mitotic figures, and the appearance of abnormalities in the subsequent interphase. This p73 activity at the M-to-G1 transition is mediated by its transactivating function because expression of the transcription dominant negative mutant p73DD induces the same mitotic exit phenotype. We also found that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Kip2/p57 gene is a specific target of p73 regulation during mitotic exit and re-entry into G1. Both knock-out of p73 gene expression by siRNAs and abrogation of p73-dependent transcription by the p73DD mutant abrogate Kip2/p57 increase at the M-to-G1 transition. Moreover, similar abnormalities (e.g. delay in late mitotic stages with the accumulation of aberrant ana-telophase figures, and abnormalities in the following interphase) are observed in cultures in which the expression of Kip2/p57 is abrogated by siRNAs.

Altogether, these results indicate that M phase-specific phosphorylation of p73 by the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex negatively regulates its transcriptional activating function. Here we have investigated the recovery of p73 function during mitotic exit. We showed that Thr-86 p73 phosphorylation is lost during mitotic exit and is accompanied by p73 relocalization to telophase nuclei and recovery of transactivating ability. Abrogation of p73 expression by specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) led to delayed mitotic progression with an increase in ana-telophase cells, accumulation of aberrant late mitotic figures, and generation of abnormal (binucleated and micronucleated) cells in the subsequent interphase. We also found that loss of p73 transcriptional activity recapitulates the same mitotic exit phenotype, and we identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Kip2/p57 gene as a specific target of p73 regulation during mitotic exit and re-entry into G1. Altogether, these results suggested that p73-dependent transcription is required for proper mitotic completion and exit to the subsequent interphase.

Hypophosphorylated p73 Proteins Relocalize to Reforming Nuclei in Telophase—Most substrates phosphorylated by the yeast p34cdc28/clb mitotic kinase complex homologous to mammalian p34cdc2/cyclin B become dephosphorylated at mitotic exit (22Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Shevchenko A. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J.

To establish whether p73 also undergoes dephosphorylation during exit from mitosis, H1299-derived p73α ponasterone A-inducible cells (24Fontemaggi G. Kela I. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Krishnamurthy J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43359-43368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were subjected to nocodazole arrest and then released from the block and analyzed for both p73 Thr-86 phosphorylation and subcellular localization during mitotic completion. As shown in Fig. 1A, p73α fully recovers its faster mobility 1 h after release from nocodazole arrest. The use of specific antibodies raised against the Thr-86 phosphorylated forms (17Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Gross I. Levasseur D. Taya Y. Loeffler J.P. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27421-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) revealed that this was concomitant with a sharp reduction of phosphorylation at this site (Fig. 1B). Cells from the same cultures were analyzed by immunofluorescence to follow up mitotic progression after nocodazole removal. In prometaphase-arrested cells, p73 was found to be excluded from condensed chromosomes and distributed throughout the cytoplasm, as detected by anti-p73 antibody staining (Fig. 1C, in red). After nocodazole washout, p73 dispersal persists throughout metaphase, anaphase, and early telophase (Ref. 16Fulco M. Costanzo A. Merlo P. Mangiacasale R. Strano S. Blandino G. Balsano C. Lavia P. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49196-49202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and data not shown). p73 then relocalizes to daughter nuclei in late telophase, as early as 1 h after nocodazole release (Fig. 1C), i.e. the time at which phosphorylation is lost. As cells progress through G1 re-entry, 3 h after nocodazole release, and chromatin decondensation is complete, the p73 signal regains its homogeneous pattern (Fig. 1C). Abrogation of p73 Function Perturbs Mitotic Progression and Exit—The observation that p73 is rapidly dephosphorylated at Thr-86 and reassociates with nuclei already in late telophase prompted us to determine whether p73 function affects mitotic completion and the M-to-G1 transition under physiological conditions, i.e. in cells that were not exposed to spindle poisons. We first analyzed progression through an entire cell division cycle in MEFs derived from p73-/- mice after growth arrest and serum restimulation. FACS analysis of cultures progressing synchronously through the cell cycle revealed that lack of p73 causes an evident accumulation of cells in the G2 and M stages followed by a delay in the M-to-G1 transition, as compared with p73-null MEFs reconstituted with p73β (Fig. 2A, left panel). Moreover, fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed the frequent occurrence of lagging chromatids and chromatin bridges between separating nuclei in the p73-/- MEFs (Fig. 2A, right panel). Next, we analyzed mitotic progression in human T98G p53-null glioma cells in which p73 expression was abrogated by p73-specific siRNAs (Fig. 2B). p73-siRNAs, although not affecting the organization of the mitotic apparatus proper (Fig. 2B, right panel, rows a-c), did perturb progression through the final stages of mitosis. The proportion of mitotic cells in ana-telophase stages increased in a statistically significant manner as compared with control cultures treated with siRNAs against GFP (Fig. 2B, lower left panel), indicating that loss of p73 delays the completion of mitosis. In addition, isolated lagging chromatids and persisting chromatin bridges between nuclei were also evident in late mitotic stages in p73-siRNA T98G cultures, as observed previously in p73-/- MEFs, indicating inaccurate or incomplete segregation to daughter cells (Fig. 2B, right panel, rows d and e). To substantiate these findings, we also analyzed interphase cells in cultures that were subjected to the RNA interference protocol for 24 h and then harvested by trypsinization and split in two fresh culture dishes for another 24 h, and thus likely to have undergone mitosis in the absence of p73 function. A statistically significant induction of abnormalities was recorded in the subsequent interphase in the absence of p73 (Fig. 2C), including binucleated cells and cells with micronuclei, possibly derived from lagging chromatids or broken chromatin bridges. These results confirmed that p73 function is required for accurate mitotic division. p73 Function during Exit from Mitosis Is Linked to Its Transcriptional Activity—We previously showed that cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of p73 at Thr-86 occurs at the G2/M transition and results in a reduced capability to bind its DNA target sequences and to activate transcription (16Fulco M. Costanzo A. Merlo P. Mangiacasale R. Strano S. Blandino G. Balsano C. Lavia P. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49196-49202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The observation that p73 is dephosphorylated and relocalizes with chromatin already in late telophase (Fig. 1, A-C) prompted us to verify whether transcriptional activity of p73 is actually required during the M-to-G1 progression to regulate exit from mitosis or, alternatively, whether the loss of other p73 functions is responsible for mitotic exit abnormalities. Indeed, although mitosis is accompanied by a global repression of nuclear RNA synthesis in higher eukaryotes, some genes, including the human cyclin B1 gene (25Sciortino S. Gurtner A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Dey A. Sacchi A. Ozato K. Piaggio G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), are transcribed even in the context of the highly condensed mitotic chromatin. Interestingly, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a specific subset of genes is transcriptionally activated in telophase (26Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3888) Google Scholar) by the Swi5p chromatin remodeling enzyme and the Gcn5p histone acetyltransferase (27Krebs J.E. Fry C.J. Samuels M.L. Peterson C.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Knapp D. Bhoite L. Stillman D.J. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5701-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to favor mitotic exit. Thus, we decided to analyze mitotic progression in T98G cells in which p73 transcriptional function was abrogated by overexpression of the dominant negative mutant p73DD (18Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores. E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, this caused a mitotic exit phenotype characterized by an increased proportion of ana-telophase figures, similar to that observed in cells in which p73 expression was abolished by siRNAs (Fig. 2B). Again, the mitotic apparatus appeared to assemble normally, yet mitotic cells expressing the p73DD mutant exhibited a variety of abnormalities in late anaphase/early telophase stages (Fig. 3B). For example, chromatin decondensed precociously and often asymmetrically in one of two segregating nuclei and/or nuclei remained frequently connected through persisting chromatin bridges. Lagging chromatids were also often observed between nuclei. The abnormal late mitotic figures observed in p73 siRNA- or p73DD-transfected cultures were virtually indistinguishable. These observations strongly suggested that the transcriptional activating function of p73 is required for proper completion of mitosis. The Kip2p57 cdki Is a Transcriptional Target of p73 during Exit from Mitosis—Although p73 shares with p53 the ability to bind the same conserved elements (p53-responsive elements, p53RE) in the regulatory regions of their target genes (1Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 2Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increasing evidence indicates that specific subsets of genes are selectively activated in vivo by p73 or p53 (29Fontemaggi G. Kela I.

Since p73 and p53 are differentially regulated during mitotic progression (16Fulco M. Costanzo A. Merlo P. Mangiacasale R. Strano S. Blandino G. Balsano C. Lavia P. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49196-49202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Casenghi M. Zaira Limongi M. D'Angelo M. Soddu S. Lavia P. Cundari E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 19205-19213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we reasoned that any gene potentially involved in control of mitotic exit by p73 should be specifically targeted by p73 but not p53. Obvious target genes known to be regulated along the cell cycle, such as p21, GADD45, and 14-3-3, are activated by both p53 and p73 (1Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 2Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J.

Chem. 2002; 45: 43359-43368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Among genes that have been shown to be selectively regulated by p73, only the ADA and the Kip2/p57 genes are implicated in control of cell cycle progression (19Tullo A. Mastropasqua G. Bourdon J.C.

Stewart C.L. Vousden K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. Mar. 2002; 99: 3529-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The ADA gene encodes an enzyme that controls nucleotide metabolism, the deficiency of which leads to defective DNA synthesis and repair. Of interest to the present study, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Kip2/p57 has been reported to cooperate with p21 to ensure coordination of M and S cycles so as to prevent endoreduplication (32Zhang P. Liegeois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Kip2/p57 is also modulated at the M-to-G1 transition. We found that Kip2/p57 is up-regulated during nocodazole release in T98G cells (Fig. 4A, row b), with a kinetics that differs from that of p21 (row c). Kip2/p57 expression peaks 1 h after release of nocodazole-induced arrest, when most cells are in telophase and p73 phosphorylation is lost (Fig. 1B), and begins to decrease after 4 h, when cells have re-entered G1, whereas p21 increase is highest at this same time (Fig. 4A, compare row b and row c). Most importantly, selective abrogation of p73 transcriptional activity, by either overexpression of the dominant negative mutant p73DD (Fig. 4B, compare the left and right panels in row a) or targeted degradation of p73 mRNA using p73-specific siRNAs (Fig. 4C, compare the left and right panels in row a), prevented Kip2/p57 induction in cells released from nocodazole arrest but fail to affect Kip2/p57 expression in nocodazole-treated cells, a condition in which p73 is transcriptionally inactive due to p34cdc2-dependent phosphorylation. These data indicated that Kip2/p57 is specifically regulated by p73 during mitotic exit, and this regulation can account, at least in part, for the requirement of active p73 in coordination of mitotic progression and correct mitotic exit. Abrogation of Kip2/p57 Induces a Mitotic Exit Phenotype— Next, we examined the effect of abrogating Kip2/p57 expression on mitotic progression and M-to-G1 transition. We reasoned that if Kip2/p57 is a p73 transcriptional target during exit from mitosis and plays an important role in the process, then knocking-out of the Kip2/p57 gene expression by siRNAs should result in a mitotic phenotype resembling that found when p73 function is impaired. Indeed, cells exposed to Kip2/p57 siRNAs showed an increased proportion of ana-telophase figures in the mitotic cell population (Fig. 5A) and accumulate both aberrant late mitotic figures (Fig. 5B, rows c and d) and nuclear abnormalities in the subsequent interphase (Fig. 5C). Again, recorded mitotic abnormalities mostly included lagging chromatids between the separating chromatid sets in ana-telophase figures and the persistence of trapped chromatin in the elongating midbody in telophase (Fig. 5B, rows c and d). Taken together these results highlighted the requirement of an intact p73-Kip2/p57 pathway for the cell to coordinate mitotic progression and correctly achieve mitotic exit. We report here for the first time a role of p73 in mitotic exit and progression to interphase. The subcellular localization and function of p73 are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events during mitosis. We previously showed that, at nuclear envelope breakdown, the endogenous p73 is phosphorylated, is excluded from condensed chromosomes, and disperses in the mitotic cytoplasm, unlike p53 that associates with mitotic microtubules and centrosomes. This differential localization first suggested that these proteins play specific, non-overlapping roles during mitosis (16Fulco M. Costanzo A. Merlo P. Mangiacasale R. Strano S. Blandino G. Balsano C. Lavia P. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49196-49202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated p73 persists during meta- and anaphase. We have now shown that in telophase, p73 is again hypophosphorylated and relocalizes to daughter nuclei. Consistent with the hypothesis that p73 plays a physiological role in mitosis, we have found that abrogation of p73 expression affects mitotic completion and the M-to-G1 transition, as evidenced by delayed progression through late mitotic stages (ana- and telophase), accompanied by an increased frequency of abnormalities in late mitotic stages and in the subsequent interphase. These results highlighted the specificity of the role played by p73 in mitosis. Most agents that perturb the mitotic apparatus (i.e. microtubule-directed chemicals; genetic mutants; laser-directed ablation of specific mitotic or chromosome components) evoke the mitotic spindle checkpoint, which arrests mitosis before anaphase, thus preventing chromatid separation and segregation (33Lew D.J. Burke D.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 251-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 34Gorbsky G.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R1001-R1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). When cells “slip” through this checkpoint and begin chromatid segregation despite the presence of defects in the mitotic apparatus, p53 function is induced and arrests further proliferation of mitotic products generated under faulty conditions (30Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Casenghi M. Zaira Limongi M. D'Angelo M. Soddu S. Lavia P. Cundari E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 19205-19213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (107) Google Scholar) through a regulatory mechanism involving ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (35Tritarelli A. Oricchio E. Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Palena A. Lavia P. Soddu S. Cundari E. Mol. Biol. Cell 1. 2004; 5: 3751-3757Crossref Google Scholar). In the present experiments, a distinct, non-overlapping role for p73 clearly emerged. Cells similarly progressed through pro-, prometa-, and metaphase whether p73 is functional or not, consistent with the notion that, in these stages, phosphorylated p73 loses its trans-activating ability, as reported in previous work (16Fulco M. Costanzo A. Merlo P. Mangiacasale R. Strano S. Blandino G. Balsano C. Lavia P. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49196-49202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the assembly of the mitotic apparatus and the spindle checkpoint function were insensitive to the presence or absence of p73. Only in the conclusive stages of the mitosis (i.e. late anaphase/telophase) was the trans-activating function of p73 required again; when this function was perturbed, mitotic completion was hindered and showed increased inaccuracy. These results highlighted the specificity of the role played by p73 in mitosis and suggested that p73 is part of the cellular machinery that regulates normal mitotic completion and transition to the following G1. Our knowledge of factors that regulate mitotic exit in mammalian cells is still fragmentary and is far from the definition of integrated pathways such as those revealed by genetics in yeast. In an effort to identify specific transcriptional targets of p73 in mitotic exit, we have found that the cdki Kip2/p57 is activated by p73, but not p53, in late telophase, concomitant with p73 loss of phosphorylation, relocalization in nuclei, and recovered ability to activate transcription. Indeed, abrogation of p73 function, using either the p73DD dominant negative mutant or p73-specific siRNAs, prevented Kip2/p57 accumulation. Furthermore, the abrogation of Kip2/p57 expression by specific siRNAs reproduced the mitotic exit phenotypes observed in cells lacking p73. Based on these data, Kip2/p57 can be viewed as one specific target of p73 important for coordination of mitotic progression and the M-to-G1 transition. The type of abnormalities detected in late mitosis (connecting chromatid bridges between separating nuclei, isolated chromatids that fail to segregate) and the absence of gross defects at the level of the mitotic apparatus suggested that p73, through p57, contributes to regulate the re-establishment of chromatin organization as cells accomplish segregation of the duplicated genomes and re-enter G1. The identification of a physiological role for p73 at mitotic exit suggested that, besides its established role in mediating cell growth arrest and/or apoptosis in response to DNA damage and spindle poisons, p73 may play an important role in cell growth control. Our results, together with the observation that p73 levels increase in S-phase cells, may evoke a possible explanation for the lack of p73 mutations in most human tumors. Major “hot spots” of p53 mutations fall in the highly conserved DNA-binding core domain; mutant p53 protein cannot bind DNA or activate p53/p73 target genes. Similar mutations in the DNA-binding core domain of p73 would abrogate its ability to activate transcription at the M-to-G1 transition and would favor aberrant mitotic exit, thus causing a detrimental effect on cell growth and viability.

Naka T. Fujimoto M. Kohzaki H. Morita Y. Narazaki M. Okumura K. Saitoh H. Nakagawa R. Uchiyama Y. Akira S. Kishimoto T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). There is evidence that SOCS1 targets IRS-1 and -2 for proteasomal degradation, an effect potentially mediated by the elongin C binding motif in the SOCS box (4Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42394-42398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of residues necessary for the elongin BC binding site does not interfere with SOCS1/IRS-1 or -2 association but does prevent IRS proteasomal degradation. More recently it has been proposed that SOCS1 binds to residues within the kinase domain of the IR that are essential for IRS-2 recognition in vitro (7Ueki K. Kondo T. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5434-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Functional evidence for interaction between SOCS1 and the insulin receptor has relied upon overexpression of SOCS1 as well as Socs1 deficiency. Although SOCS1 overexpression results in inhibition of signaling from numerous cell surface receptors, it is not clear that all of these are physiological targets of SOCS1 in vivo. Nevertheless it is clear that overexpression of SOCS1, for example by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, causes inhibition of phosphorylation of IRS-2 in vivo (7Ueki K. Kondo T. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5434-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Evidence of a role of SOCS1 in regulation of insulin signaling is supported by preliminary studies in Socs1–/– mice showing hypoglycemia and increased insulin responses of adipocytes in vitro (6Kawazoe Y. Naka T. Fujimoto M. Kohzaki H. Morita Y. Narazaki M. Okumura K. Saitoh H. Nakagawa R. Uchiyama Y. Akira S. Kishimoto T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Socs1–/– mice develop an inflammatory disease affecting the liver, pancreas, and heart (8Starr R. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Brysha M. Willson T.A. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14395-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). They die within 3 weeks of birth most likely from severe liver damage. It is therefore difficult to study metabolic effects of Socs1 deficiency in vivo in these mice, and other approaches have been adopted, potentially not resulting in complete Socs1 deficiency, including antisense oligonucleotide delivery in vivo (9Ueki K. Kondo T. Tseng Y.H. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We have carried out metabolic studies in Socs1–/– mice protected from lethal inflammation by concurrent Ifng gene deletion that allowed Socs1–/– mice to be studied as adults (10Alexander W.S.

We found that adult Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice have metabolic abnormalities consistent with enhanced insulin sensitivity. Mice—Socs1–/– and Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice have been described previously (11Starr R.

Experiments were initially performed on mice that were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6–129/Sv genetic background. These were subsequently backcrossed to C57BL/6 for 10 generations, and experiments were then repeated on these mice. They were bred and housed in clean conditions in the animal facilities of the Water and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and St. Vincent's Institute. Anti-IFNγ antibody treatment was as described previously (13Bullen D.V. Darwiche R. Metcalf D. Handman E. Alexander W.S. Immunology. 2001; 104: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the animal ethics committee of the institutions involved. Glucose and Insulin Measurements—Blood glucose levels were measured using Advantage II Glucose Strips with Advantage glucometer (Roche Diagnostics). Serum or plasma glucose concentrations were measured using a glucose analyzer (YSI, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Serum or plasma insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Metabolic Tests—After an overnight fast, animals were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg pentobarbitone sodium (Nembutal, Rhone Merieux, QLD Australia). Catheters were inserted into the right jugular vein for infusion and the left carotid artery for plasma sampling. A tracheostomy was also performed to prevent airway obstruction during the experiment. Anesthesia was maintained by intravenous administration of pentobarbitone sodium, and body temperature was kept at 37 °C with a heating lamp. Whole body glucose turnover was measured using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with continuous infusion (0.15 μCi/min) of [6-3H]glucose as described elsewhere (14Lamont B.J. Andrikopoulos S. Funkat A. Favaloro J. Ye J.M. Kraegen E.W. Howlett K.F. Zajac J.D. Proietto J. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Kooptiwut S. Zraika S. Thorburn A.W. Dunlop M.E. Darwiche R. Kay T.W. Proietto J. Andrikopoulos S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). During the clamp, insulin was infused at a constant rate of 1.5 milliunits/kg/min. Euglycemia was maintained by the infusion of 1% glucose in saline. Plasma samples were collected during steady state conditions at 90, 100, and 110 min. Under steady state conditions the rate of glucose appearance equals the rate of glucose disappearance. The rate of glucose appearance (Ra) was calculated by dividing the infusion rate of [6-3H]glucose (dpm/min) by the plasma [6-3H]glucose specific activity. The rate of endogenous glucose production was measured as the difference between the calculated Ra and the glucose infusion rate. Glucose and arginine tolerance testing was performed as described previously (15Kooptiwut S. Zraika S. Thorburn A.W. Dunlop M.E. Darwiche R. Kay T.W. Proietto J. Andrikopoulos S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, after overnight fasting, animals were anesthetized and a catheter inserted into the left carotid artery for infusion and plasma sampling. Animals were allowed to recover from the surgery for 20 min. During the experiment body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a heating lamp. A bolus of glucose (1g/kg) or arginine (1g/kg) was infused through the catheter, and blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min from the catheter at regular intervals. The plasma was then assayed for glucose and insulin concentrations. Real Time PCR—Tissues were collected from 12-week-old mice in a random fed (basal) state or after clamps and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were mechanically homogenized (Ultra-Turrax T8, IKA, Staufen, Germany), and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's directions (RNAwiz, Ambion, Austin, TX). Reverse transcriptase reaction was performed using AMV Reverse Transcriptase and Random Primers (Promega). The resultant cDNA was amplified using Rotorgene 3000 (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) with Assay-on-demand primers and FAM-labeled probes for SOCS3, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase and 18S (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). cDNA content in individual samples was normalized using 18S as a housekeeping gene. Measurement of Kinase Levels and Activity—Liver extracts were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were removed, and the protein content was measured via the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities were measured, in livers from fed mice, in immunocomplex from 500 μg of protein using AMPK α1 and α2 antibodies, bound to protein A-agarose beads for 2 h. Immunocomplexes were washed and suspended in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) buffer for the AMPK assay in the presence of 200 μm AMP. Activities were calculated as pmol of phosphate incorporated into the “SAMS” peptide/min/mg of protein subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (16Steinberg G.R. Smith A.C. Van Denderen B.J. Chen Z. Murthy S. Campbell D.J. Heigenhauser G.J. Dyck D.J. Kemp B.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 4575-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of protein with streptavidin and immunoblotted and probed using the ACCα Ser79 phosphospecific antibody as previously described (17Chen Z.P. McConell G.K. Michell B.J. Snow R.J. Canny B.J. Kemp B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1202-E1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basal and insulin-stimulated tissue extracts (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose-bound anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 (Santa Cruz) and immunoblotted with phosphotyrosine (Upstate), IRS-1, IRS-2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 (Upstate) antibodies. Phosphorylated protein kinase B/Akt (Ser407), total protein kinase B/AKT (Upstate), p85, AMPKα1 (17Chen Z.P. McConell G.K. Michell B.J. Snow R.J. Canny B.J. Kemp B.E. Am. J.

Socs1-deficient Mice Are Severely Hypoglycemic—Socs1–/– mice are born normal but rapidly become sick because of inflammation of several organs. Blood analysis revealed that Socs1–/– mice were severely hypoglycemic when they became moribund at 10–14 days of age (Fig. 1A). Typically they displayed blood glucose levels of less than 3 mm. This was compared with 7–8 mm in Socs1+/+ or Socs1+/– littermate controls of the same age. Prevention of Inflammation in Socs1–/– Mice Does Not Return Them to Normoglycemia—Severe hypoglycemia in Socs1–/– mice might be explained by multiorgan inflammation and in particular liver damage. This inflammatory syndrome is dependent on the proinflammatory cytokine IFNγ (11Starr R. Hilton D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W.H. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 597-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (645) Google Scholar). To investigate whether SOCS1 deficiency affects blood glucose homeostasis independently of the inflammatory disease, IFNγ was removed by administering neutralizing antibodies to IFNγ or by deleting the Ifng gene. Socs1 null mice treated with anti-IFNγ antibodies are incompletely protected from inflammation but survive the neonatal period. They showed evidence of hypoglycemia also (Fig. 2) although much less severe than the mice not treated with anti-IFNγ antibody. Because antibody-treated Socs1–/– mice eventually go on to develop inflammatory lesions due to the clearance of the antibody (13Bullen D.V. Darwiche R. Metcalf D. Handman E. Alexander W.S. Immunology. 2001; 104: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we next analyzed Socs1–/– mice that were also deficient for the Ifng gene. These mice are healthy until 1 year of age and then develop low grade inflammation (18Metcalf D. Di Rago L. Mifsud S. Hartley L. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9174-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To diminish the effects of genetic heterogeneity Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for 10 generations. Hypoglycemia was not observed in fed Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice and was very slight in fasted mice compared with Ifng–/– mice (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Perturbed glucose and insulin homeostasis in Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice.

However both Socs1–/– and Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice were found to have lower serum insulin levels compared with their respective controls (Figs. 1B and 3B). To test whether hypoinsulinemia was attributed to suppressed insulin secretion, insulin secretory capacity was measured in Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice by an intravenous glucose tolerance test and an arginine tolerance test. Interestingly, no significant difference in insulin secretion was seen in the Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice (Fig. 3, C and D) suggesting that the mild hypoinsulinemia may be secondary to the mild hypoglycemia and possibly due to enhanced insulin sensitivity. Socs1–/– Mice Have Suppressed Endogenous Glucose Production—Ifng deficiency allows Socs1–/– mice to grow normally to adulthood and be studied for insulin sensitivity using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps. Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice required higher rates of glucose infusion compared with Ifng–/– and wild-type mice indicating greater insulin sensitivity. Endogenous glucose production was suppressed in Socs1–/–Ifng–/– mice, but glucose disposal was not different (Fig. 4). Improved Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity Is Mediated by Elevated IRS-2 Expression and Suppressed Hepatic Gene Expression in Socs1–/– Ifng–/– Mice—Because of the apparent improvement in hepatic but not peripheral insulin sensitivity we focused on examining mechanisms regulating hepatic insulin sensitivity. Basal (from random fed mice) and insulin-stimulated (following the clamp studies) livers were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Hepatic glycogen content was not altered between groups (C57BL/6 306 ± 68 μmol/g/dry mass; Ifng–/– 493 ± 74 μmol/g/dry mass; Socs1–/– Ifng–/– 444 ± 64 μmol/g/ dry mass). Improved insulin sensitivity in Socs1 null mice was associated with elevated IRS-2 protein expression (+39%, p = 0.018 and +67%, p = 0.021, Fig. 5A) and enhanced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (+68%, p = 0.039 and +75%, p = 0.001, Fig. 5B) relative to wild-type and Ifng–/– mice, respectively. Elevated IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was associated with increased IRS-2 associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 (+30%, p = 0.02 and +36%, p = 0.021, Fig. 5C) and phosphorylated protein kinase B/Akt (+43%, p < 0.01 and +41%, p = 0.034, Fig. 5D). SOCS1 deficiency did not alter the expression or phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 5E). Although the levels of IRS-1 in muscle and adipose tissue were also comparable among the three groups of mice (Fig. 5G), the levels of IRS-2 were increased in these tissues of Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice (Fig. 5H). Despite increased IRS-2 expression within muscle and adipose tissue insulin stimulated phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt was not significantly different (muscle, C57BL/6 1.17 ± 0.84 A.U.; Ifng–/– 1.25 ± 0.22 A.U.; Socs1–/– Ifng–/– 1.30 ± 0.21 A.U.; adipose C57BL/6 1.84 ± 0.57 A.U.; Ifng–/– 1.25 ± 0.16 A.U.; Socs1–/– Ifng–/– 1.18 ± 0.15 A.U.). The data demonstrate that SOCS1 is a critical regulator of IRS-2 but not IRS-1 expression in vivo and suggest improved liver insulin sensitivity in Socs1 null mice is mediated by increased hepatic IRS-2 signaling. To investigate the downstream effects of enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity the mRNA expression of glucose-6-phosphatase and PEPCK were determined. In Socs1 null mice PEPCK expression was significantly reduced during the clamp compared with wild-type and Ifng-deficient mice (Fig. 6) consistent with their reduced glucose production. AMPK Is Normal in Socs1 Null Mice—Recent evidence indicates AMPK may regulate hepatic insulin sensitivity. AMPK is an αβγ heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (of which there are α1 and α2 isoforms) and two noncatalytic subunits (β, γ) (19Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Campbell D.J. Chen Z.P. Murthy S. Walter M. Gupta A. Adams J.J. Katsis F. van Denderen B. Jennings I.G. Iseli T. Michell B.J. Witters L.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 162-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Med. 2002; 8: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar) increase AMPK activity resulting in improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic glucose output via the suppression of the gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase and PEPCK. Hepatic AMPK α1 and α2 activities (pmol/min/mg of protein) were not changed in Socs1–/– mice relative to wild-type and Ifng–/– mice (AMPK α1, C57BL/6 1.10 ± 0.16; Ifng–/–, 0.78 ± 0.07; Socs1–/– Ifng–/–, 1.26 ± 0.36; AMPK α2, C57BL/6 1.31 ± 0.17; Ifng–/– 0.97 ± 0.19; Socs1–/– Ifng–/–, 1.70 ± 0.33) indicating that the improved insulin sensitivity was not secondary to changes in AMPK. SOCS3 mRNA Is Strongly Induced in Muscle by Insulin— Because of the difference in the effect of SOCS1 on insulin sensitivity in liver and muscle, we tested whether SOCS3 expression in muscle might compensate for SOCS1 deficiency and regulate insulin action in muscle. Liver, adipose, and gastrocnemius tissue were removed from mice either at the end of an insulin clamp or without insulin infusion, and SOCS3 mRNA was quantified by reverse transcription PCR. Minor increases in SOCS3 levels were seen in liver and adipose tissue with insulin but much greater increases in SOCS3 expression were observed in muscle (Fig. 7). These data show that SOCS1 is a physiological regulator of insulin action. Socs1-deficient mice have evidence of increased insulin action resulting in lower blood glucose and insulin levels. Increased rate of glucose infusion required to maintain euglycemia in Socs1–/– mice and evidence for greater suppression of hepatic glucose production in response to insulin were observed. Sick Socs1–/– mice were hypoglycemic, but healthy mice were much less so. Hypoglycemic mice had suppressed plasma insulin levels consistent with enhanced insulin sensitivity. There was no evidence of increased glucose disposal making it unlikely that insulin action was increased in skeletal muscle or other sites of glucose disposal. These data are the first detailed metabolic studies in mice genetically deficient in Socs1. They are consistent with previous evidence (5Mooney R.A. Senn J. Cameron S. Inamdar N. Boivin L.M. Shang Y. Furlanetto R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25889-25893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 6Kawazoe Y. Naka T. Fujimoto M. Kohzaki H. Morita Y. Narazaki M. Okumura K.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5434-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), particularly inferred from overexpression, that SOCS1 can inhibit insulin signaling. In the liver there was both increased IRS-2 expression and phosphorylation in the setting of a constant infusion of insulin suggesting increased signaling at a proximal step in the insulin signaling pathway. Evidence for indirect effects on insulin sensitivity, for example mediated by adipokines via AMPK, was not found in that AMPK levels and activity were normal. Additionally the rate-determining gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK was reduced consistent with the observed phenotype of reduced fasting glucose. Expression of gluconeogenic enzymes is reduced by insulin but also by cytokines such as IL-6 (24Inoue H. Ogawa W. Ozaki M. Haga S. Matsumoto M. Furukawa K. Hashimoto N. Kido Y. Mori T. Sakaue H. Teshigawara K. Jin S. Iguchi H. Hiramatsu R. LeRoith D. Takeda K. Akira S. Kasuga M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Therefore either increased insulin signaling or increased IL-6 signaling or both could be responsible. The role of IL-6 in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes in this setting is unlikely, as basal STAT-3 phosphorylation was undetectable in both wild-type, Ifng–/– and Socs1–/– Ifng–/– animals (data not shown). IL-6 sensitivity may, however, be important in settings in which circulating IL-6 is elevated such as neonatal Socs1–/– mice with intact IFNγ. Suppression of endogenous glucose production in clamp studies in response to insulin was also seen. Together these observations are consistent with increased insulin signaling in Socs1-deficient hepatocytes. We also sought indirect effects of insulin on endogenous glucose production but found no changes in gluconeogenic fuels such as free fatty acids in Socs1–/––Ifng– mice (data not shown). It is of interest that deficiency of SOCS1 resulted in liver insulin hypersensitivity, with little effect on peripheral glucose disposal. This was associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 (but not IRS-1) and Akt in liver, but no change in intracellular signaling in muscle and adipose tissue as assessed by phosphorylation of Akt. Recent studies have suggested that SOCS1 preferentially binds to the kinase domain of the insulin receptor, which includes the three tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr1146, Tyr1150, and Tyr1151) and that these are critical for the recognition of IRS-2 rather than IRS-1 (7Ueki K. Kondo T. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5434-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Furthermore data obtained from genetic ablation of the IRS proteins suggest that IRS-1 is more important in muscle glucose metabolism, whereas IRS-2 seems to be more prominent in liver glucose metabolism (25Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 26Previs S.F. Withers D.J. Ren J.M. White M.F.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Thus, in Socs1–/– mice, the preferential increase in IRS-2 phosphorylation is consistent with a preferential effect of SOCS1 on IRS-2 and accounts for the enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. Our data are consistent with recent evidence that reduction in hepatic SOCS1 by intravenous delivery of SOCS1 antisense oligonucleotides can improve insulin action in hyperinsulinemic, severely insulin-resistant db/db mice (9Ueki K. Kondo T. Tseng Y.H. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In that study it was suggested that elevated SOCS1 levels may account in part for the insulin resistance of db/db mice, but in our study we have found that Socs1 deficiency increases insulin action physiologically as well as in a pathological state with elevated SOCS1 expression. This is in some ways surprising not only because of the redundancy in the SOCS family but also because constitutive levels of SOCS1 expression in the liver are very low yet apparently sufficient to regulate receptor signaling. Impaired insulin action in the liver is a critical component of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Conditional deletion of the Ir in liver cells results in severe dysregulation of blood glucose and progressive liver impairment (28Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of the Ir in muscle results in a much milder phenotype (29Lauro D. Kido Y. Castle A.L. Zarnowski M.J. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Accili D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Liver impairment secondary to hepatic insulin resistance is also clinically important and is improved, at least experimentally, by SOCS inhibition (9Ueki K. Kondo T. Tseng Y.H. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Genetic deficiency of Irs2 results in many of the features of type 2 diabetes and, unlike Irs1 deficiency, results in overt diabetes (30Brady M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 886-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased levels of IRS-2 are potentially beneficial not only in liver but also in other tissues including the pancreatic islets, where IRS-2 enhances β-cell function and regeneration, and the hypothalamus in which IRS-2 appears to regulate leptin sensitivity (31Lin X.

We have examined β-cell function in Socs1–/– Ifng–/– mice using glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Preliminary data in mice on a mixed 129/Sv × C57BL/6 genetic background suggested increased insulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose, consistent with increased β-cell function in the absence of Socs1. However, this was not confirmed in backcrossed C57BL/6 mice, perhaps indicating the effects of background genes. Mice on a mixed genetic background also had more clear cut hypoglycemia than backcrossed mice and increased insulin secretion may have played a part in this. We observed clinically overt hypoglycemia particularly in mice with probable liver failure that is known to be able to cause hypoglycemia. Additionally Socs1–/– mice that are sick have very severe pancreatitis. Histological analysis showed increased numbers of insulin positive cells throughout the parenchyma of the pancreas and increased numbers of insulin-positive ductal cells, consistent with increased β-cell differentiation from precursors (33Chen Y. Chong M.M. Darwiche R. Thomas H.E. Kay T.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 913-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This was previously also observed in transgenic ins-IFNγ mice with high local concentrations of IFNγ in the pancreas (23Gu D. Sarvetnick N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 33-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that increased insulin secretion not fully suppressed by hypoglycemia contributes to hypoglycemia in sick Socs1–/– mice as well as insulin sensitivity and impaired hepatic glucose production. In contrast, no abnormality of islet or β-cell number was seen in Socs1–/–Ifng–/– mice. We also found some evidence for increased expression of SOCS3 in muscle compared with liver, which may also explain the lack of effect of Socs1 deficiency on glucose disposal. From in vitro biochemical studies it is likely that SOCS3 can inhibit binding of both IRS-1 and -2 to the IR and so SOCS3 could potentially substitute for SOCS1. Increased expression of SOCS3 relative to SOCS1 in skeletal muscle could explain the phenotype we have observed as could compensatory increases in SOCS3 in muscle in Socs1–/– mice. SOCS3 compensation in muscle but not liver may be an additional explanation for the liver specificity of the increased insulin action we observed. Our data showed that even at physiological levels SOCS1 inhibits insulin signaling, indicating that it is very likely that increased levels of SOCS1 induced by cytokines or other factors would be capable of causing insulin resistance. Whether inhibition of SOCS1 to improve insulin sensitivity is a realistic therapeutic option is unclear because the effects of Socs1 deficiency on other receptors can be deleterious and worsen inflammation. Nevertheless the beneficial effects of Socs1 deficiency on insulin signaling through IRS-2 make this worthy of further exploration. We thank Dr. Warren Alexander for mice and other reagents."

The V3 loop in GP120 is a crucial region for determining coreceptor usage during viral entry, and a variety of amino acid substitutions has been observed in clinical isolates. To construct an HIV-1 V3 loop library, we chose 10 amino acid positions in the V3 loop and incorporated random combinations (27,648 possibilities) of the amino acid substitutions derived from 31 R5 viruses into the V3 loop of HIV-1JR-FL proviral DNA. The constructed HIV-1 library contained 6.6 × 106 independent clones containing a set of 0–10 amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop. To address whether restricted steric alteration in the V3 loop could confer resistance to an entry inhibitor, TAK-779, we selected entry inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 by increasing the concentration of TAK-779 from 0.10 to 0.30 μm in PM1-CCR5 cells with high expression of CCR5. The selected viruses at passage 8 contained five amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop without any other mutations in GP120 and showed 15-fold resistance compared with the parental virus. These results indicated that a certain structure of the V3 loop containing amino acid substitutions derived from 31 R5 viruses can contribute to the acquisition of resistance to entry inhibitors binding to CCR5. Taken together, this type of HIV-1 V3 loop library is useful for isolating and analyzing the specific biological features of HIV-1 with respect to alterations of the V3 loop structure.

Entry of R5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; env, envelope; GP, glycoprotein. into target cells requires sequential interaction of the envelope glycoprotein GP120 with CD4 and the coreceptor CCR5 (1Berger E. Murphy P. Farber J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The binding of GP120 to CD4 leads to exposure of the coreceptor-binding site, designated the third hypervariable loop (V3 loop), which is composed of ∼35 amino acid residues (2Platt E.J. Kuhmann S.E.

Subsequently, the interaction of GP120 with the coreceptor induces the exposure of a fusion peptide of transmembrane glycoprotein GP41, and allows membrane fusion and entry of the viral core into the target cell (3Kwong P.D.

In fact, an increase in the positive charge of the V3 loop is often associated with CXCR4 usage (7Hoffman T.L. Doms R.W. Mol. Membr.

Variation in the residues flanking the GPG motif can alter the stability of the β-sheet and/or alter the surface accessibility of this element, thereby influencing coreceptor usage (28Catasti P.

If we can manipulate a mixed population of HIV-1 with diversity in the V3 loop in vitro, it would be a useful system for screening and analyzing the biological features of HIV-1 with regard to V3 variation. There has been a report regarding the construction of a heterogeneous retrovirus population in vitro (31Berkhout B. Klaver B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5020-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and we recently constructed an in vitro system that created an HIV-1 library containing mutations associated with protease inhibitor resistance (32Yusa K. Song W. Bartelmann M. Harada S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3031-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the current report, we constructed an R5 HIV-1 V3 loop library containing diverse structures of the V3 loop. We chose 10 amino acid positions in the V3 loop (residues 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 312, 314, 317, 318, and 321; V3 loop starting from Cys293 to Cys327 within V3 of HIV-1JR-FL Env) (Fig. 1A), and we incorporated the amino acid substitutions in 31 R5 HIV-1 strains obtained from the Los Alamos HIV data base (//hiv-web.lanl.gov). Theoretically, the number of substitution combinations in a library carrying a set of random combinations of 0–10 substitutions is 27,648 possibilities. A new class of antiretroviral drugs that prevent virus entry are being developed. TAK-779 inhibits HIV-1 replication by blocking the interaction of GP120 with CCR5 (34Baba M. Nishimura O. Kanzaki N. Okamoto M. Sawada H. Iizawa Y. Shiraishi M. Aramaki Y. Okonogi K. Ogawa Y. Meguro K. Fujino M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5698-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). This compound has been shown previously to inhibit cell-to-cell fusion and cell-free virus infectivity in vitro (34Baba M. Nishimura O. Kanzaki N. Okamoto M. Sawada H. Iizawa Y. Shiraishi M. Aramaki Y. Okonogi K. Ogawa Y. Meguro K. Fujino M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5698-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The binding site for TAK-779 is located near the CCR5 extracellular surface, within a cavity between transmembrane helices (35Dragic T. Trkola A. Thompson D.A. Cormier E.G. Kajumo F.A. Maxwell E. Lin S.W. Ying W. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Moore J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5639-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Recently, the viruses resistant to an entry inhibitor enfuvirtide (T20) were sensitive to TAK-779 (36Reeves J.D. Lee F.H. Miamidian J.L. Jabara C.B. Juntilla M.M. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, development of TAK-779 resistance remains to be elucidated. To address the contribution of the V3 loop to susceptibility to an entry inhibitor, we selected TAK-779-resistant variants from the HIV-1 library, and we isolated R5 entry inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 with mutations restricted to the V3 loop. Cell Culture and Molecular Clones—PM1 (37Schwenk H.U. Schneider U. Blut. 1975; 31: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal (MAGI) cells (38Kimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Preference Reagent Program. PM1-CCR5 cells were generated by standard retrovirus-mediated transduction of PM1 cells with pBABE-CCR5 provided by the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Preference Reagent Program. PM1 and PM1-CCR5 cells were grown in RPMI 1640-based complete medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Vitromex, Bayern, Germany), 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 units/ml streptomycin. The transduced cells were selected with complete medium plus 1 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma), and a single clone was selected based upon the expression level of CCR5 assessed by flow cytometry analysis. Similarly, MAGI-CCR5 was isolated by standard retrovirus-mediated transduction of MAGI cells with pBABE-CCR5 (39Chen Z. Zhou P. Ho D.D. Landau N.R. Marx P.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAGI and MAGI-CCR5 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 units/ml streptomycin. The HIV-1 proviral expression vector pJR-FL was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Koyanagi (Kyoto University). pJR-FLan was created from pJR-FL by incorporation of AflII and NheI sites into env at nucleotides 6395 and 6564, respectively. There were no amino acid substitutions caused by incorporation of the AflII site (CTG AAA (Leu Lys) → CTTAAG (Leu Lys)). Incorporation of the NheI site led to two amino acid substitutions (GTT ATA (Val Ile) → GCT AGC (Ala Ser)). HIV-1JR-FLan was used as the parental virus. Construction of an R5 HIV-1 V3 Loop Library—The strategy used to construct the HIV-1 library carrying a set of random amino acid substitutions is shown in Fig. 2A. The 2077-bp StuI-XhoI fragment from pJR-FLan was subcloned into pCRΔZ digested with StuI and XhoI, resulting in pCR-SANX. pCRΔZ was created from pCR-blunt (Invitrogen) by deleting a PmlI fragment containing a Zeocin cassette. Six oligonucleotides, V31, V32, V33, V34, V35, and V36, were commercially synthesized to generate three short DNA fragments with sticky ends. The respective pairs of complementary oligonucleotides at 0.35 μg/μl were denatured for 2 min at 90 °C in a heat block and then left in the switched-off heat block for 30 min in 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at room temperature for annealing. The resultant short DNA fragments were designated V312 (48 bp), V334 (65 bp), and V356 (64 bp), respectively. V334 contained 10 degenerated codons (ARA for Lys or Arg; RGT for Ser or Gly; RTA for Ile or Val; HMY for His, Pro, Asn, Ser, Thr, or Tyr; MTR for Ile, Met, or Leu; TKK for Phe, Leu, Trp, or Cys; RCW for Thr or Ala; SMM for Glu, Asp, Gln, Ala, His, or Pro; RTA for Ile or Val; and RAT for Asp or Asn) (Fig. 2A). The single letter code used here is as follows: R represents A or G; H represents A, C, or T; M represents A or C; Y represents C or T; K represents G or T; W represents A or T; and S represents C or G. The three DNA fragments (0.25 μg each) were ligated by T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and the resultant 185-bp DNA fragment was purified by 1.5% agarose electrophoresis. One hundred nanograms of the purified DNA fragment was used for PCR as the DNA template with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The upstream primer was VV-Af (5′-ACAGCTTAAGGAATCTGTAGAAATTAATTG-3′), and the downstream primer was VV-Nh (5′-ATTTGCTAGCTATCTGTTTTAAAGTGTCAT-3′). The amplification conditions for the first-round PCR were 94 °C for 1 min, 16 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 60 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR was performed using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The PCR product (5.0 μg) was purified using the Concert Rapid PCR Clean-up System (Invitrogen), digested with AflII and NheI and then ligated into the AflII and NheI sites of pCR-SXΔAN (10.0 μg). pCR-SXΔAN was created from pCR-SANX by replacing the AflII-NheI fragment with a linker. The ligation mixture was purified by Microcon-30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and used to transform Escherichia coli strain DH5α by electroporation with an ECM 600 (BTX, San Diego) at 2.5 kV, generating pCR-SX-V3Lib containing 7.1 × 106 independent clones with an AflII-NheI fragment. After purification of the pCR-SX-V3Lib DNA, the StuI-XhoI fragment from 15 μg of the plasmid was cloned into the StuI and XhoI sites of pJR-FLΔSX. pJR-FLΔSX was created from pJR-FL by replacing the StuI-XhoI fragment of pJR-FL with a linker. The ligation products (0.2 μg) were transformed into E. coli strain JM109 by electroporation as described above. Finally, the HIV-1 library, designated pJR-FL-V3Lib, contained 6.6 × 106 independent clones containing a 2077-bp (StuI-XhoI) env DNA fragment (ligation efficiency, 77%) (Table I).Table IHIV-1 library (pJR-FL-V3Lib) containing combinations of 0-10 amino acid substitutions in the V3 loopNo. combinations of amino acid substitutionsNo. independent clonesaAfter transformation, 1/1000 volume of the cell suspension was inoculated on an LB agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of Replication—All viral stocks, including the virus library, were prepared by transfecting 293T cells as described previously (32Yusa K. Song W. Bartelmann M. Harada S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3031-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Viral stocks for analysis of the replication of the virus library HIV-1V3Lib were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with pJR-FL-V3Lib. Then 5 × 105 of PM1-CCR5 or MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1JR-FLan or HIV-1V3Lib stocks containing 600 ng of p24 Gag antigen/ml. Viral replication was monitored by measuring the p24 Gag antigen concentration in the supernatants of the challenged cells. p24 Gag antigen was determined by p24 Gag antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using RETRO-TEK (ZeptoMetrix, Co., Buffalo, NY). Selection of TAK-779-resistant HIV-1V3Lib—PM1-CCR5 cells (1 × 106) were infected with HIV-1V3Lib (600 ng of p24 Gag antigen) at passage 1 and incubated for 3 days in the presence of 0.1 μm TAK-779. Virus passages were then performed at 3–4-day intervals using PM1-CCR5 cells (2 × 105) in the absence or presence of 0.10 μm TAK-779. The concentration of TAK-779 was increased from 0.10 to 0.30 μm at passage 3. The infectivity of the supernatant at each passage was evaluated using MAGI-CCR5 cells in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm TAK-779. Determination of Susceptibilities—The susceptibilities of the viruses to entry inhibitors were determined by the MAGI assay using previously titrated virus preparations (80 blue foci/well). MAGI-CCR5 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were plated into 48-well tissue culture plates 1 day prior to infection. After absorption of the virus for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 0.001–1.0 μm TAK-779 or AMD3100, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then further incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of 0.0010 nm to 3.0 μm TAK-779 or AMD3100 in fresh medium. The cells were stained, and the number of blue foci in each well was counted (37Schwenk H.U. Schneider U. Blut. 1975; 31: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Sequencing—The nucleotide sequences of the V3 loops in the virus library were determined as follows. The virus mixture was precipitated and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR using the ImProm-II transcription system (Promega, Madison, WT). A 380-bp fragment containing a V3 loop sequence was amplified by PCR in a 50-μl reaction volume comprising 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, and 2 units of AmpliTaq (Applied Biosystems Inc.) with primers VV1 (5′-AATGGCAGTCTAGCAGAAGAAG-3′) and VV2 (5′-TTTCTGGGTCCCCTCCTGAGGA-3′). The PCR products were purified by 1% agarose electrophoresis and cloned into the pCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The cloned sequences were sequenced using an ABI Prism 310 (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Construction of the Proviral DNA for the HIV-1 V3 Loop Library—A variety of amino acid substitutions was observed in the V3 loop of 31 R5 HIV-1 derived from the Los Alamos HIV data base (Fig. 1). To construct a proviral DNA mixture containing a set of random substitution combinations derived from the envelope V3 loops of the R5 isolates, we chose 10 amino acid positions for substitutions (residues 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 312, 314, 317, 318 and 321; V3 loop starting from Cys293 to Cys327 in HIV-1JR-FL) (Fig. 2A). AflII-NheI DNA fragments containing a set of random combinations of these mutations were prepared with overlapping oligodeoxynucleotides comprising both DNA strands and were subsequently annealed and ligated to form the complete gene. In the AflII-NheI DNA fragments, the residues at positions 302, 303, 304, 314, 318, and 321 contained two possible amino acid residues, whereas the residues at positions 305, 306, 312, and 317 contained 6, 3, 4, and 6 possibilities, respectively (Fig. 2A). Amino acid substitutions (Phe to Cys at 312, Gln to His or Pro at 3317; Fig. 2A, underlined) that were not detected in the R5 isolates (Fig. 1) were inevitably incorporated into the library because of unintended combinations of nucleotide substitutions. Theoretically, the number of possible combinations of 0–10 amino acid substitutions was calculated to be 27,648 (Table I), and the lowest frequency combination of the substitutions was 0.00204%. We finally obtained a proviral DNA, designated pJR-FL-V3Lib, for the HIV-1 library that contained 6.6 × 106 independent clones. This size of the library contained all possible combinations of the recombinants. Incorporation of random combinations of the amino acid substitutions into the V3 loops was confirmed by the sequencing of randomly selected clones from the library DNA (Fig. 3A). There was no marked difference in the composition of the amino acid residues at the 10 positions in V3 between the library DNA and the virus library prepared for the following experiments (Fig. 3B). Coreceptor Usage of the Virus Library—We tested the coreceptor usage of the virus library using a single-round assay (Fig. 4A). HIV-1JR-FLan, which was used as a background for the construction of the V3 loop library, showed similar infectivity to HIV-1JR-FL. The infectivity of the virus library HIV-1V3Lib into MAGI-CCR5 cells was 26% lower than that of parental HIV-1JR-FLan. This result suggested that most of the viral clones in the library were replication-competent. In fact, 16 of 21 (76%) viral clones randomly selected from the library were competent in PM1-CCR5 cells (data not shown). No blue-stained foci were detected in MAGI cells infected with HIV-1JR-FLan and HIV-1JR-FL, whereas the X4 virus HIV-1NL4–3 did generate blue foci. To examine whether the library contained viral clones that acquired the ability to use CXCR4 as a coreceptor by a combination of mutations restricted to the V3 loop, a large amount of p24 was used for infection of MAGI cells. No blue-stained cells were obtained with HIV-1V3Lib (Fig. 4A). To further confirm this result, MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1V3Lib (Fig. 4B). p24 production from PM1-CCR5 cells infected with HIV-1JR-FLan was saturated on day 3 because of the intense cytopathic effect caused by the high efficiency of infection at time 0. p24 generation from HIV-1V3Lib-infected PM1-CCR5 cells reached a higher level than that of HIV-1JR-FLan-infected cells because of a slower cell death rate, although no increase in p24 was observed in the supernatant of MT-2 cells infected with the same amount of p24 of HIV-1V3Lib, even at day 7 post-infection. Similarly, there was no increase in the amount of p24 released from MT-2 cells infected with HIV-1JR-FLan. We repeated the same experiments, but we did not obtain any viral clones from the library that could use CXCR4 for entry. These results indicated that none of the combinations of the 0–10 substitutions (27,648 possibilities) in the V3 loop derived from R5 viruses could use CXCR4 as a coreceptor in an HIV-1JR-FLan background. The V3 loop of clinical isolates has a global positive charge that can vary from +2 to +10, and an increase in the positive charge of the V3 loop enabled the use of CXCR4 (7Hoffman T.L. Doms R.W. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Moulard M. Lortat-Jacob H. Mondor I. Roca G. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Zhao L. Olson W. Kwong P.D. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1948-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The virus library had V3 loops with a positive charge from +3to +7 and did not contain the X4 type. Selection of TAK-779-resistant HIV-1 from the Library—In the presence of 0.1 μm TAK-779, infectivity of HIV-1JR-FLan or unselected HIV-1V3Lib was suppressed by 86–92%, as evaluated by a single-round assay using MAGI-CCR5 cells (Fig. 5, passage 0). After three passages of HIV-1V3Lib in the presence of 0.1 μm TAK-779, we increased the concentration of TAK-779 to 0.30 μm at passage 3. HIV-1JR-FLan could not be passaged in PM1-CCR5 cells in the presence of 0.1 μm TAK-779 because of poor replication, whereas HIV-1V3Lib started to replicate after a delay of 3 or 4 days compared with HIV-1V3Lib in the absence of 0.30 μm TAK-779 at passage 3 (data not shown). The inhibitor-sensitive population of the virus library seemed to be replaced with the inhibitor-resistant variants from passages 3 to 8 (Fig. 5). The infectivities of the variants at passages 8 and 10 were not even inhibited by the presence of 0.10 μm TAK-779. In contrast, HIV-1V3Lib at passage 8 in the same passage schedule without the inhibitor did not acquire resistance to TAK-779. We determined the IC50 of the selected HIV-1V3Lib using a single-round assay (Table II). The selected variants showed 15-fold resistance to TAK-779 compared with HIV-1JR-FLan, whereas unselected HIV-1V3Lib at passage 8 did not. To elucidate the alteration of the V3 loop responsible for the resistance in the selected HIV-1V3Lib, we subcloned and sequenced the V3 loops of the variants. The V3 loops contained five incorporated substitutions, namely I304V, H305N, I306M, F312L, and E317D (Fig. 6A). In addition to these substitutions, 25% of the clones (3/12) contained A332D in the GP120 C3 region. No other mutations were detected in other regions of GP120 in the selected viruses by direct sequencing (data not shown). In the absence of the entry inhibitor, the viruses at passage 8 only contained three types of V3 loop in 13 clones (Fig. 6A), although the virus at passage 0 contained complexity in all 10 amino acid positions (Fig. 3A). These V3 loops, especially V3 loop number 01, containing I304V, H305Y, I306L, E317H, I318V, and D324N (85%; 11/13), may confer a substantial replicative advantage among the 27,648 possible substitution combinations in PM1-CCR5 cells without selective pressure.Table IISusceptibilities of selected HIV-1Lib-P8 to entry inhibitorsVirusIC50aIC50 indicates the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the blue foci formation in MAGI-CCR5 cells at 2 days post-infection.TAK-779AMD3100μmHIV-1JR-FLan0.032 ± 0.07bDegree of resistance (x-fold) as compared with HIV-1JR-FLan.

Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4527-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that loop 1 affects the affinity of actin-myosin-II for ADP, motility and the Vmax of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity, possibly through Pi release (2Spudich J.A.

The steady-state actin-activated ATPase activity; rate of ATP-induced dissociation of actin from Myo1b1IQ; rate of ADP release from actin-Myo1b1IQ; and the affinity of actin for Myo1b1IQ and Myo1b1IQ·ADP differed in the chimeras versus wild type, indicating that loop 1 has a much wider range of effects on the coupling between actin and nucleotide binding events than previously thought. In particular, the biphasic ATP-induced dissociation of actin from actin-Myo1b1IQ was significantly altered in the chimeras. This provided evidence that loop 1 contributes to the accessibility of the nucleotide pocket and is involved in the integration of information from the actin-, nucleotide-, γ-Pi-, and calmodulin-binding sites and predicts that loop 1 modulates the load dependence of the motor.

Myo1b (aka 130-kDa myosin I, MYR 1, and MM1α) is a mammalian class I myosin that is expressed in many different tissues (9Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil.

It is associated with the plasma membrane (12Balish M.F. Moeller III, E.F. Coluccio L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and in cell protrusions such as lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, suggesting its role in some aspects of cell motility (13Ruppert C. Godel J. Müller R.T. Kroschewski R. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overproduction of Myo1b or non-functional truncated Myo1b affects the distribution of endocytic compartments, suggesting its role in membrane trafficking (14Raposo G. Cordonnier M.N. Tenza D. Menichi B. Durrbach A. Louvard D. Coudrier E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1477-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence indicates that Myo1b mediates lysosome movement (15Cordonnier M.N. Dauzonne D. Louvard D. Coudrier E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4013-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The ATP-induced dissociation of actin from actin-Myo1b is much slower than from most other myosins, and unlike skeletal muscle, myosin II is biphasic, consisting of both a fast and a slow phase (16Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The fast phase is dependent on ATP concentration and is eliminated by preincubation with ADP. The slow phase is independent of ATP concentration and shares the same rate constant as ADP release but cannot be eliminated by decreasing ADP concentration. We have interpreted these results in conjunction with results from two other approaches: (i) single molecule studies demonstrating that Myo1b exhibits a two-part power stroke (17Veigel C. Coluccio L.M. Jontes J.D. Sparrow J.C. Milligan R.A. Molloy J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and (ii) cryo-electron microscopy studies showing that Myo1b exhibits an ADP-induced conformational change. 1C. Arthur, A. Lin, L. M. Coluccio, and R. A. Milligan, unpublished information. 1C. Arthur, A. Lin, L. M. Coluccio, and R. A. Milligan, unpublished information.

Molloy J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar); and the conformational change seen in ADP1 might be manifestations of the same event. We proposed that Pi release causes a rotation of the converter domain of the molecule in which the motor domain connects to the calmodulin-binding (or IQ) region, resulting in the power stroke, but that this is insufficient to open the nucleotide pocket and release ADP. ADP release requires a second rotation corresponding to the second step in the optical laser trap (19Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C. Coluccio L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21624-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). If this model is correct, then isomerization provides a direct link between nucleotide access to its binding site and the mechanical transient. This supports a role for ADP release as a strain-sensing mechanism (16Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereby strain on a cross-bridge inhibits the conformational change and results in a significantly reduced rate of ADP release. The structural features in Myo1b responsible for ADP release and/or strain-sensing are unknown. The motor domain of Myo1b is similar in amino acid sequence and backbone structure to other myosins, but there are regions of dissimilarity (21Sellers J.R. Myosins. Second. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar, 22Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Loop 1, one of several flexible surface loops in the myosin motor domain, is near the nucleotide-binding pocket (Fig. 1), and its sequence varies among myosin classes (2Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 22Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Suppression in the variability of this region among myosins with similar activities suggests that it might be responsible for modulating the specific kinetic characteristics that differentiate one myosin from another (23Goodson H.V. Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Studies with scallop myosins II indicate that the differences in ATPase activity, ADP affinity, and motility between striated and catch muscle myosins are due to loop 1 because these myosins are 97% identical, having been spliced from the same gene, and this surface loop represents the only significant area of divergence (3Kurzawa-Goertz S.E.

Substitutions in loop 1 of Dictyostelium myosin II also indicate that loop 1 affects the rate of ADP release (5Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Structural studies of myosin V in different conformational states indicate that loop 1 comprises in part the “transducer region,” which facilitates communication between the actin interface and nucleotide-binding pocket (1Coureux P.-D.

Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), the sequence of loop 1 in phasic (for example, gizzard) smooth muscle myosin II is longer that that of tonic (for example, aortic or uterine) smooth muscle myosin II with the phasic isoform containing an additional 7-aminoacid insert, QGPSFSY (Fig. 2, underlined in the smooth muscle myosin sequence). Insertions in loop 1 of smooth muscle myosin II cause an increase in enzymatic activity as well as in vitro motility, implying that loop 1 modulates the rate of ADP release in smooth muscle myosin II (6Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Sweeney et al. (7Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) showed by analyzing baculovirus-expressed chimeras that motility, ADP release, and ATPase activities are affected by loop 1 in smooth muscle heavy meromyosin. They proposed that ADP release is related to the flexibility of the loop and that loop 1 might control the rate of ADP release by modulating the opening of the nucleotide pocket when ADP occupies the site. Smaller loops were proposed to restrict access to the nucleotide pocket and favor ADP binding (7Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In a related mechanical study, Lauzon et al. (24Lauzon A.M. Tyska M.J. Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) showed that the extra insert in loop 1 of phasic muscle myosin II had no effect on the step size or the elementary isometric force generated by the myosin but that the lifetime of the cross-bridge attached to actin was lengthened. This was due to both a reduced rate constant for ADP release and a reduced rate constant for ATP binding. Loop 1 is shorter in Myo1b than in most other myosins, which should favor ADP binding. How modifying the length of loop 1 affects the interaction of Myo1b with nucleotide and actin was tested here. Furthermore, we used Myo1b as a valuable model system to explore the role of specific amino acids in loop 1 since its loop 1 is only 6 amino acids in length. If loop 1 affects ADP release in Myo1b, then given the enhanced strain dependence of ADP release exhibited by this molecule, changes in loop 1 might also modulate a wide range of related properties. Here, we showed that loop 1 of Myo1b modulates not only ADP release but also the actin affinity, the maximum rate constant of ATP-induced dissociation of actin from actin-Myo1b, the accessibility of the nucleotide pocket, and the calcium regulation of these events. Furthermore, we confirmed that the position of loop 1 in the transducer region integrates a series of input signals and proposed that that this is likely to include the load on the motor. Preparation of Chimeras—We prepared a series of constructs in which loop 1 of Myo1b was replaced with loops from other myosins or alanine substitutions in the original loop were made. To define the beginning and end of loop 1 in various myosins, secondary structure assignments were made by the program DSSP (25Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11983) Google Scholar) using as a guide the structure of Dictyostelium MyoE (Protein Data Bank code 1LKX (26Kollmar M. Durrwang U. Kliche W. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2517-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2). MyoE is in the same subgroup of myosin 1 as Myo1b and its crystal structure is the closest available structure (Fig. 1). Two unique, restriction sites flanking loop 1 in the epitope-tagged motor domain of Myo1b1IQ, which represents the motor domain and the first IQ domain of Myo1b (amino acids 1-728), were introduced through silent mutation, and then an in-frame fusion protein was created by polymerase chain reaction. This S1-like construct displays steady- and transient-state kinetics indistinguishable from the parent molecule (19Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C. Coluccio L.M. J. Biol.

Chimeras were made by enzymatically digesting the vector at the unique restriction sites and then ligating in duplex DNA representing the different mutations. After verifying the sequences, the constructs were expressed in the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) along with calmodulin. After 4 days of infection, the insect cell pellets were homogenized in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP in the presence of protease inhibitors and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was applied to an anti-FLAG column, and the expressed protein was eluted with a step gradient of FLAG peptide (27Perreault-Micale C. Shushan A.D. Coluccio L.M. J. Biol.

Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 333-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity was determined in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, and the appropriate ratio of 2 mm EGTA and 2 mm Ca-EGTA to effect a pCa of 4.6, 5, 6, or 8.9 (29Ashley C.C.

Standard curves were generated with known amounts of phosphate. The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of the mutants were compared with that of wild-type Myo1b1IQ.

The pyrene actin fluorescence was excited at 365 nm, and emission was detected after passing through a KV 389-nm cut-off filter. The stated concentrations of reactants in the text and figure legends are those after mixing in the stopped-flow observation chamber unless otherwise stated. In secondary plots, the concentrations are indicated as [X]pre or [X]post to indicate whether the values are those before or after mixing. Stopped-flow data were fitted to one or two exponentials as described previously using a non-linear least-squares curve fitting using Kinetasyst software provided by Hi-Tech. Data Interpretation—The kinetics of the interaction of expressed wild-type Myo1b1IQ and the loop 1 mutants with nucleotide (T, ATP; D, ADP) were interpreted in terms of the model we described previously (19Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C. Coluccio L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21624-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). In this model, we assume that actin-Myo1b exists in two conformations in the absence of nucleotide (A.M and A.M′, equilibrium defined by Kα = k+α/k-α) and in the presence of ADP (A.M.D and A.M′.D, equilibrium defined by KαD = k+αD/k-αD). In the M′ state, nucleotide can freely exchange with the solvent but not in the M state. Conversion of M to M′ requires opening of the nucleotide-binding pocket via a conformational change that is assumed to be coupled to a swing of the converter/IQ regions of the myosin motor domain. The data presented here and summarized in Table I allow assignment of all of the rate and equilibrium constants of Scheme 1. The assignment of the constants to the data is summarized here.Table ITransient kinetic analyses of Myo1b chimeras K1k+2, apparent second order rate constant for ATP induced dissociation of actin-Myo1b; 1/K1, ATP concentration for half-maximal kobs of the fast phase of dissociation of actin-Myo1b; kmax fast phase = k+2; Kα = amplitudefast/amplitudeslow; kmax, slow = k+α; KAD, dissociation constant of ADP for A-M (KAD = KADP·KαD); k-AD, observed ADP release rate constant (k+αD); k+AD, apparent second order rate constant of ADP binding to A-M; KA, dissociation constant of actin for myosin; KDA, dissociation constant of actin for myosin-ADP.Constant in Scheme 1Rate/Equilibrium constantKGAEVN (WT)123456SHKGKKDTSITSHKGKKDTSIT QGPSFSYGAGAEVNKGAAVNAAAAAA+Ca2+–Ca2++Ca2+–Ca2++Ca2+–Ca2++Ca2+–Ca2++Ca2+–Ca2++Ca2+–Ca2++Ca2+–Ca2+Nucleotide bindingK1k+2K1k+2 (μm-1 s-1)0.070.030.370.530.610.480.57NDaND, not determined0.0970.0470.0680.0830.1210.271/K1(mm)1.81.201.400.761.101.280.80ND2.152.011.320.631.650.52k+2Fast kmax (s-1) Fast/slow119.037.00515.00400.00647.00611.00457.00ND208969052200136KαAmplitude1.850.94.8833.673.34.89ND5.844.482.471.7710.7112.6k+αSlow kmax (s-1)6231538113061ND225.81.56bAmplitude was very low, therefore k+αis not well-defined.

Basal ATPase activity was <0.01 s-1 in all cases Open table in a new tab In the absence of ADP, high ATP concentrations induce the dissociation of actin from Myo1b in two phases. The fast phase represents dissociation from A.M′ with kobs,fast=K1k+2[ATP]/(1+K1[ATP])(Eq. 1) The slow phase is limited by the isomerization of A.M to A.M′ with kobs,slow = k+α. The ratio of the amplitudes of the two phases of the ATP-induced dissociation defines the equilibrium constant between the two forms of A.M′/A.M = Kα, and since Kα = k+α/k-α, k-α can be determined. The overall dissociation constant of ADP for the actin-Myo1b complex, KAD, is defined by KADP·KαD, where KADP is the dissociation constant for ADP from A.M′. To titrate both A.M complexes to A.M.D., actin-Myo1b was pre-equilibrated with a range of ADP concentrations before adding excess ATP. ATP-induced dissociation of actin from A.M.D occurs via A.M′.D and A.M′ and is limited by k+αD. For Myo1b1IQ-WT, k+α and k+αD are very similar and cannot be distinguished. In this case, increasing ADP concentration results in kobs of both phases of dissociation being independent of ADP concentration, but the fast amplitude is reduced as ADP is increased. If k+α and k+αD differ by more than a factor of 3, then both fast and slow amplitudes seen at zero ADP are reduced as ADP is increased and replaced by a new phase with kobs = k+αD. The effect of ADP on the amplitude of the fast phase of ATP-induced dissociation of actin-Myo1b was analyzed according to Ampfast=Amp0/(1+[ADP]/KAD)+C(Eq. 2) where Ampfast is the observed amplitude of the fast phase of the reaction; Amp0 = amplitude at zero ADP concentration; [ADP] = the concentration of ADP before mixing; KAD = the dissociation equilibrium constant of ADP for actin-Myo1b; and C = end point. The end point of the reaction defined by C was fixed to zero, if the tendency of the reaction was to go to zero. Amplitude is calculated as a percentage of the end point of the reaction, according to Amplitude=(ΔF/Ft∞)×100(Eq. 3) where amplitude, expressed as %, equals the change in fluorescence observed during the reaction (ΔF) divided by the fluorescence at the end point of the reaction (Ft∞), multiplied by 100. To determine the contribution of loop 1 to the steady- and transient-state kinetic properties of Myo1b, we prepared chimeras consisting of the Myo1b motor domain and first IQ domain, Myo1b1IQ, in which the wild-type (WT) loop 1 was substituted for the longer loops 1 from either tonic (aortic) muscle myosin II (Myo1b1IQ-tonic) or phasic (gizzard) muscle myosin II (Myo1b1IQ-phasic). Alternatively, wild-type loop 1 was replaced with a single glycine (Myo1b1IQ-G) (Fig. 3). The purified expressed proteins appeared by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as two single bands representing the myosin I heavy chain and calmodulin. The steady-state kinetics of Myo1b1IQ-WT were compared with those of Myo1b1IQ-tonic, Myo1b1IQ-phasic, and Myo1b1IQ-G. The basal ATPase was very low in all cases (<0.01 s-1), and actin activated the ATPase activities linearly over the range of 0-30 μm actin to values of between 0.1 and 0.14 s-1 in the presence of calcium (Fig. 4). This was about 30-50% of the values observed for Myo1b1IQ-WT. The absence of calcium reduced the activation in each case by 2-5-fold, similar to the 3-fold lower activation seen for Myo1b1IQ-WT (Table I). The ATP-induced dissociation of pyrene-labeled actin-Myo1b1IQ was measured for Myo1b1IQ-WT and each of the three chimeras in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5). The dissociation of actin-Myo1b1IQ-WT and actin-Myo1b1IQ-tonic by 1 mm ATP resulted in an increase in fluorescence and gave a biphasic reaction fitted to two exponentials (Fig. 5, A and B). For Myo1b1IQ-WT, kobs was 6.6 and 40.1 s-1 with amplitudes of 17.1 and 31.7%, respectively, and for Myo1b1IQ-tonic, kobs was 19 and 196 s-1 with amplitudes of 9 and 44%, respectively. The dependence of kobs on [ATP] in the presence of Ca2+ was plotted with the best fits to a hyperbola, kobs = kmax[ATP]/(K0.5+[ATP]), for both the fast (Fig. 5C) and the slow (Fig. 5D) phases of the reaction for all four proteins. In each case, the data could be described by hyperbolas except for the slow phase in the case of Myo1b1IQ-WT, which, as noted previously, appeared independent of ATP concentration. In the case of the slow phase, the model does not predict a hyperbolic dependence upon ATP concentration, and the plots are shown as a “guide to the eye” to establish the maximum value of the slow phases. The values derived from the fits are listed in Table I. For each of the constructs, the maximal observed rate of the fast phase (Scheme 1, kmax = k+2) was 2-3-fold faster than the value for Myo1b1IQ-WT, whereas the ATP concentration required for half-maximal saturation (Scheme 1, K0.5 = 1/K1) was similar in each case. Similarly, the maximal observed rates for the slow phase (kmax = k+α) were 5-12-fold faster for the loop 1 constructs than for Myo1b1IQ-WT, and the ATP concentrations required for half-saturation for the constructs were similar to each other (0.5-1 mm) and about half the values observed for the fast phase. In terms of Scheme 1, the ratio of the amplitudes of the fast:slow phase defined the ratio of the occupancy of the A.M′: A.M states. These are listed in Table I and show that in each case, A.M, the slowly dissociating form, had a lower occupancy than in Myo1b1IQ-WT. The experiment was repeated in the absence of calcium, and as shown previously for Myo1b1IQ-WT, both the amplitudes and the rate constants of the two phases were calcium-sensitive. In calcium, the occupancy of the A.M with Kα increased by 50% for Myo1b1IQ-WT and by much smaller amounts for Myo1b1IQ-tonic (30%) and Myo1b1IQ-phasic (10%). The k+2 values were slowed down on removal of calcium by 20% for Myo1b1IQ-tonic and 5% for Myo1b1IQ-phasic as compared with 3-fold for Myo1b1IQ-WT. Myo1b1IQ-G was unstable in the absence of calcium, and no reliable data were obtained. The influence of ADP on the ATP-induced dissociation of actin-Myo1b1IQ was measured for each of these mutants. The results from Myo1b1IQ-WT and Myo1b1IQ-tonic are shown in Fig. 6. As seen before (Fig. 5), in the absence of ADP, the addition of 2.5 mm ATP to Myo1b1IQ-WT resulted in a rapid increase in fluorescence best described by two exponentials with kobs = 67 and 11 s-1 and amplitudes of 17 and 10%, respectively (Fig. 6A). In the presence of 20 μm ADP, the change in fluorescence was also described by two exponentials with kobs = 138 and 9 s-1 and amplitude of 5 and 7%, respectively (Fig. 6A). Titration of ADP from 0 to 20 μm showed that the total amplitude is decreased and is due to a lower affinity of myosin for actin, but the change in the ratio of the fast:slow amplitude indicated greater occupancy of the slow component. The kobs of both the fast and the slow phases were independent of ATP concentration above 1 mm and remained largely unchanged as ADP concentration was increased within the limits of the measurement. Note that at small amplitudes, the kobs of the fast phase became difficult to define with any precision. These results were essentially the same as those reported previously for Myo1b1IQ and interpreted in terms of Scheme 1 as ADP resulting in occupancy of the A.M.D state with the release of ADP being limited by k+αD, which is similar in value to k+α (19Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C.

https://openalex.org/W2080467264,"MnmE is an evolutionarily conserved, three domain GTPase involved in tRNA modification. In contrast to Ras proteins, MnmE exhibits a high intrinsic GTPase activity and requires GTP hydrolysis to be functionally active. Its G domain conserves the GTPase activity of the full protein, and thus, it should contain the catalytic residues responsible for this activity. In this work, mutational analysis of all conserved arginine residues of the MnmE G-domain indicates that MnmE, unlike other GTPases, does not use an arginine finger to drive catalysis. In addition, we show that residues in the G2 motif (249GTTRD253), which resides in the switch I region, are not important for GTP binding but play some role in stabilizing the transition state, specially Gly249 and Thr251. On the other hand, G2 mutations leading to a minor loss of the GTPase activity result in a non-functional MnmE protein. This indicates that GTP hydrolysis is a required but non-sufficient condition so that MnmE can mediate modification of tRNA. The conformational change of the switch I region associated with GTP hydrolysis seems to be crucial for the function of MnmE, and the invariant threonine (Thr251) of the G2 motif would be essential for such a change, because it cannot be substituted by serine. MnmE defects result in impaired growth, a condition that is exacerbated when defects in other genes involved in the decoding process are simultaneously present. This behavior is reminiscent to that found in yeast and stresses the importance of tRNA modification for gene expression.

MnmE defects result in impaired growth, a condition that is exacerbated when defects in other genes involved in the decoding process are simultaneously present. This behavior is reminiscent to that found in yeast and stresses the importance of tRNA modification for gene expression. GTPases are involved in many different and essential cellular processes, including protein synthesis and translocation, membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and cell cycle control (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar, 2Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The common property shared by these proteins is the presence of a structural module, the G-domain, which is involved in the switching of the protein between a GTP-bound and a GDP-bound conformation. This conformational switch is crucial for the function of all GTPases (3Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of members from the G protein superfamily indicate that the conserved residues of the G domain (grouped in motifs G1 to G4, Fig. 1) are invariably involved in binding of guanine nucleotides and Mg2+, hydrolysis of GTP, or controlling the conformational change. This change is primarily confined to two highly flexible regions called switches I and II, which include the G2 and G3 motifs, respectively. The GTPase cycle is regulated by the intrinsic properties of each GTPase, as well as by the specific factors that the GTPase interacts with. Thus, GAPs 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; Pi, inorganic phosphate; cmnm, carboximethylaminomethyl; mnm5U34, 5-methylaminomethyl uridine at position 34; mnm5s2U, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine; mnm5s2U34, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34; cmnm5s2U34, 5-carboximethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34; s2U, 2-thiouridine; s2U34, 2-thiouridine at position 34; mant, methylanthraniloyl; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; Pi, inorganic phosphate; cmnm, carboximethylaminomethyl; mnm5U34, 5-methylaminomethyl uridine at position 34; mnm5s2U, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine; mnm5s2U34, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34; cmnm5s2U34, 5-carboximethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34; s2U, 2-thiouridine; s2U34, 2-thiouridine at position 34; mant, methylanthraniloyl; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. stimulate GTPase reaction by several orders of magnitude and guanine nucleotide exchange factors and guanine nucleotide-dissociation inhibitors regulate the nucleotide exchange (3Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Regulatory GTPases, like Ras-related proteins, are in an active state when GTP-bound; the binding of GTP causes a conformational change in the proteins that allows interaction with a target molecule or effector; upon GTP hydrolysis, they become inactive. The GTPase cycle of Ras proteins requires participation of GAPs and guanine nucleotide exchange factors, because these GTPases typically show a very low intrinsic hydrolase activity and a very high affinity for guanine nucleotides. In most members of Ras family, GAPs stabilize the transition state of the reaction by supplying a so-called arginine finger (which stabilizes the negative charge development at the phosphate groups of GTP during the hydrolysis reaction) and enhancing stability of amino acids located in switches I and II (3Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 4Bourne H.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Scheffzek K.

A glutamine adjacent to motif G3 is also crucial to stabilize the transition state and orient the attacking water molecule, being assisted in this respect by the arginine finger. Gα subunits of trimeric G proteins use a similar mechanism for GTP hydrolysis, but the catalytic invariant arginine is provided in cis from a helical domain of the GTPase polypeptide (3Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Other cases of GTPases carrying putative catalytic arginines in “cis” have been recently reported (8Zhang B. Zhang Y. Collins C.C. Johnson D.I. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

Interestingly, there are several data pointing out that multiple GTP hydrolysis mechanisms independent of Gln and Arg are likely to exist (3Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A.

MnmE is involved in the modification of the wobble-position uridine (U34) of tRNAs that read codons ending with A or G, in the mixed codon family boxes, i.e. tRNAmnm5s2UUULys, tRNAmnm5s2UUCGlu, tRNAcmnm5s2UUGGln, tRNAcmnm5UmAALeu, and tRNAmnm5UCUArg. In the modification pathway of these tRNAs, MnmE controls, together with GidA, the addition of the cmnm group in position 5 of the U34, although the precise role of both proteins in the modification reaction is still unknown (Fig. 2). In tRNAmnm5s2UUULys and tRNAmnm5s2UUCGlu, MnmC transforms the cmnm5 group into the final mnm5 modification, meanwhile MnmA, together with IscS, carries out thiolation in the 2-position of the wobble uridine (14Hagervall T.G.

Modifications in the 2- and 5-positions occur independently of each other; thus, thiolation may precede or follow the synthesis of the side chain at position 5.

Unlike the G domain-only proteins of the Ras family, MnmE is a medium-size protein of 50 kDa that consists of three regions, an ∼220-amino acid N-terminal region, required for self-assembly, a middle GTPase domain of about 160 residues, and an ∼75-amino acid C-terminal region, which contains the only Cys residue present in the protein (12Cabedo H.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); this peculiar biochemical properties determine that MnmE can perform multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis in vitro without participation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GAPs, but the protein requires very high substrate concentrations for high rates of GTP hydrolysis (Km > 400 μm). Strikingly, the isolated GTPase domain of MnmE roughly conserves the guanine nucleotide binding and GTPase activities of the intact MnmE molecule, which indicates that the MnmE G-domain contains the catalytic residues that explain for the relatively high intrinsic GTPase activity exhibited by the entire protein. A recent mutational analysis indicated that the G domain of MnmE is essential for its tRNA-modifying function, which requires effective hydrolysis of GTP, and not simply GTP binding (13Yim L.

Thus, it was suggested that MnmE uses GTP hydrolysis to promote structural rearrangements that convert the protein to its active state. The trigger for the conformational change of GTPases is thought to be universal. In the GTP-bound form, there are two hydrogen bonds from γ-phosphate oxygens to the main-chain NH groups of invariant residues Thr (G2 motif) and Gly (G3 motif). After GTP hydrolysis (which may be or not dependent on an arginine finger), there is a structural rearrangement into a new conformation, mediated by the loss of the interactions of these residues (3Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The main purpose of this work was to study the role of the G2 motif in the functional mechanism of MnmE as well as to get insights into the peculiar biochemical properties of this protein by mutating the conserved arginines of its G-domain. Bacterial Strains, Phages, Plasmids, and DNA Manipulations— Escherichia coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I, unless specified otherwise.

Antibiotics were added as recommended (30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). IC4126 and derivatives were grown at 30 °C and plated at 30 °C or at 42 °C for viability tests. β-Galactosidase assay was performed as previously described (30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Protein Techniques—Overproduction and purification of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins was done in DEV16 transformed with plasmid pIC684 or derivatives. Cleavage with thrombin of the chimeras, which were purified by affinity chromatography, allowed the isolation of recombinant wild-type (12Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C.

In this respect, it should be pointed out that native and recombinant forms of the wild-type MnmE protein exhibit identical GTPase properties. 3M. Martínez-Vicente, L. Yim, M. Villarroya, M.

Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Before use, the anti-MnmE antiserum (12Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was affinity-purified with nitrocellulose-bound MnmE. GTPase and Nucleotide-binding Assays—GTP hydrolysis was measured by a colorimetric assay for determination of Pi release, as previously described (13Yim L. Martínez-Vicente M. Villarroya M. Aguado C. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28378-28387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine values for Vmax and Km, the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression (GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, Inc.). MnmE was titrated against fluorescent mant nucleotides (Jena Bioscience) until saturation was reached. The mant nucleotides (2 μm) were excited at 360 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored at 440 nm (LS 50 B spectrophotometer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Unless otherwise indicated, all binding assays were performed at 25 °C in GTPase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol). The binding constants (Kd values) were calculated by fitting the curves with non-linear regression, using GraphPad Prism software. Readthrough Measurements—Misreading of the UAG stop codon carried by the lacZ105 gene was monitored by using the β-galactosidase assay as described (13Yim L. Martínez-Vicente M. Villarroya M.

Special precautions for very low β-galactosidase activities were taken (21Elseviers D. Petrullo L.A. Gallagher P.

Analysis of tRNAGlu Modification by Northern Blot—Total tRNA from strains grown to an A600 ∼ 0.6–0.8 was extracted and deacylated (22Krüger M.K. Sørensen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The tRNA was quantified by absorbance measurement at 260 nm with a Unicam UV-visible spectrophotometer (Helios-β). Northern blots were performed as described (13Yim L. Martínez-Vicente M. Villarroya M. Aguado C. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. J. Biol.

Analysis of Modified Nucleosides in tRNA—Bacterial strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C to about 5 × 108 cells/ml (A600 ∼ 0.8). The cells were lysed, and total RNA was prepared (31Emilsson V. Kurland C.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4359-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), dissolved in R200 buffer (100 mm Tris-H3PO4, pH 6.3, 15% ethanol, 200 mm KCl), and applied to a Nucleobond column equilibrated with the same buffer. tRNA was eluted with the same buffer, except that the KCl concentration was raised to 650 mm. The tRNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol containing 1% of potassium acetate, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and dried. It was then dissolved in water, and a 75-μg sample was degraded to nucleosides with nuclease P1 (US Biological) followed by treatment with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (32Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The resulting hydrolysate was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (32Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) on a Develosil C30 column (Phenomenex). The chromatograms were scanned at specific wavelengths to optimize the detection of thiolated nucleosides. It should be pointed out that Luria-Bertani broth is deficient in selenium (18Wittwer A.J. Stadtman T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); therefore, MnmE-specific tRNAs isolated from strains grown in this medium mostly carry sulfur at position 2. Mutational Analysis of the MnmE Switch I Region—In the switch I region of GTP-binding proteins, an invariant Thr is the only residue of the G2 motif conserved among GTPase families (Fig. 1). It is usually involved, via its side-chain hydroxyl in the coordination of the crucial Mg2+ and, via its main chain NH, in contacting the γ-phosphate. Other residues of the G2 motif are highly conserved within each GTPase family, but not between different families. Alignment of members of the MnmE family indicates that motif GTTRD, between G1 and G3, is absolutely conserved and, therefore, it appears as the putative G2 signature sequence of this family (Fig. 1). To analyze its role in the biochemical properties of MnmE, we firstly changed each residue in this motif to alanine. To determine whether the mutant proteins were capable of binding guanine nucleotides, we carried out binding studies in solution with fluorescent nucleotides. mant-guanine nucleotides have been shown to be useful probes of G-protein activation and conformational state (33Lin B. Covalle K.L. Maddock J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5825-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lin B. Skidmore J.M. Bhatt A. Pfeffer S.M. Pawloski L. Maddock J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001;"

We identified αSNAP as an interactive partner of Gα12 using yeast two-hybrid screening. glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed the selective interaction of αSNAP with Gα12 in COS-7 as well as in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Using domain swapping experiments, we demonstrated that the N-terminal region of Gα12 (1–37 amino acids) was necessary and sufficient for its interaction with αSNAP. Gα13 with its N-terminal extension replaced by that of Gα12 acquired the ability to bind to αSNAP, whereas Gα12 with its N terminus replaced by that of Gα13 lost this ability. Using four point mutants of αSNAP, which alter its ability to bind to the SNARE complex, we determined that the convex rather than the concave surface of αSNAP was involved in its interaction with Gα12. Co-transfection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with Gα12 and αSNAP stabilized VE-cadherin at the plasma membrane, whereas down-regulation of αSNAP with siRNA resulted in the loss of VE-cadherin from the cell surface and, when used in conjunction with Gα12 overexpression, decreased endothelial barrier function. Our results demonstrate a direct link between the α subunit of G12 and αSNAP, an essential component of the membrane fusion machinery, and implicate a role for this interaction in regulating the membrane localization of VE-cadherin and endothelial barrier function.

Heterotrimeric G proteins, consisting of Gα and Gβγ subunits, are crucial regulators of multiple signaling pathways. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors promotes the dissociation of Gα subunit in a GTP-bound form, and both Gα and Gβγ subunits interact with downstream effectors (see Ref. 1Offermanns S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar for review). Gα12 and Gα13 belong to one of the four major families of Gα subunits (Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12) based on their sequence similarities (2Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The monomeric G proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are effectors of both Gα12 and Gα13, and their activation is mediated by several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; SNAP, soluble NSF-associated protein; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ECIS, electric cell substrate impedance sensor; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; SNAP, soluble NSF-associated protein; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ECIS, electric cell substrate impedance sensor; HA, hemagglutinin. which bind directly to Gα12 and Gα13.

Moreover, although the absence of Gα13 leads to a defect in angiogenesis and is embryonically lethal (15Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I.

The complex roles of Gα12 and Gα13 may reflect their ability to interact with many protein partners, such as several RhoGEFs (14Kozasa T. Jiang X.J. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G.

Voyno-Yasenetskaya S. FASEB J. 2001; 15 (A206): A206Google Scholar), which can mediate a variety of responses (23Kurose H. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some of these interacting partners bind both Gα12 and Gα13, whereas others are specific for one of them. In vascular endothelial cells, the endothelial-specific cadherin, VE-cadherin, plays fundamental roles in the control of microvascular permeability and angiogenesis (see Ref. 24Vincent P.A. Xiao K. Buckley K.M. Kowalczyk A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C987-C997Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and references therein). Newly synthesized VE-cadherin is transported to the plasma membrane and forms a homotypic interaction with VE-cadherin from other endothelial cells, resulting in the assembly of adherens junctions. An important aspect of the monolayer confluence is that cadherin junctions stabilize as cells grow to confluence and become “contact-inhibited” (25Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cell contact-mediated inhibition of proliferation is the result of “outside-in” signaling events generated in the trans-interacting cadherins such as the activation of Rac and Cdc42 (26Izumi G. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Morimoto K. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Gα12 has recently been found to bind directly to the C-terminal region of E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein with a single plasma membrane-spanning region near the C terminus (27Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar), and thus it is possible that it may also be involved in promoting junctional assembly and endothelial cell confluence. Regulation of cadherin targeting to the plasma membrane is poorly understood. It presumably involves a balance between the delivery of the protein to the membrane and its endocytosis followed by either targeting for degradation or recycling back to the plasma membrane (24Vincent P.A. Xiao K. Buckley K.M. Kowalczyk A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C987-C997Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The final step in any intracellular membrane trafficking event is membrane fusion, which requires soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF)-associated protein (SNAP) to associate with SNAREs (SNAP receptors) and NSF (see Ref. 30Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar and references therein). αSNAP (and its yeast homolog, Sec17) couples the energy produced by NSF-mediated ATP hydrolysis to induce conformational changes of SNAREs and leads to the disassembly of the NSF·SNAP·SNARE complex. Sec17 is a 14-helix α/α protein with nine N-terminal antiparallel α-helices forming a twisted sheetlike structure (with two faces, concave and convex, and two ridges) and five C-terminal α-helices forming a globular bundle (31Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Depletion of αSNAP affects cytokinesis, leading to the disruption of intercellular bridges (32Echard A. Hickson G.R. Foley E. O'Farrell P.H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1685-1693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Also decreased αSNAP levels may lead to disruption of apical transport and mislocalization of apical proteins, including cadherin (33Chae T.H. Kim S. Marz K.E. Hanson P.I. Walsh C.A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that αSNAP specifically interacts with Gα12 in yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. We show herein that αSNAP binds to the N-terminal region of Gα12 and that the αSNAP·Gα12 interaction is involved in VE-cadherin trafficking to the plasma membrane of endothelial cells, in which it contributes to the formation of adherens junctions and hence the control of cell confluence and endothelial barrier function. Materials—The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: monoclonal anti-Myc, anti-HA, polyclonal anti-αSNAP, anti-Gα12, anti-Gα13 (raised against N-terminal peptides of respective G proteins), and anti-VE-cadherin. Anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Glu-Glu monoclonal antibody was purchased from Covance. AlexaFluor 488, 594, or 633 anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Constructs for EE-tagged Gα subunits were from Guthrie Institute. The following constructs were kindly provided: HA-tagged Gα12, Gα13, and Gαs by Silvio Gutkind (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); Gα12N/Gα13C and Gα13N/Gα12C by Manabu Negishi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan); wild type αSNAP by Robert Burgoyne (University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK); and His6-αSNAP mutants (K53E, K122E, K140A, and Y200K) by Phyllis Hanson (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). Glutathione-agarose and Lubrol (decaethylene glycol monododecyl ether; P9769) were purchased from Sigma. Protein A/G-agarose was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Plasmid Constructs—The yeast two-hybrid MATCHMAKER LexA system (Clontech) was employed to detect specific protein-protein interactions. The Gα12 two-hybrid bait was constructed by subcloning the cDNA for human mutationally activated Gα12 Q229L into the pLexA polylinker region. A human testis library in the vector pB42AD was screened. All of the colonies were assayed for lacZ and LEU2 reporter gene activities; double-positive clones were picked, and plasmids were isolated and sequenced. (EcoRI-XhoI) insert of ∼900 bp encoding a fragment of αSNAP was recloned into pCMV-Tag3B (Stratagene) or pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) for expression in mammalian cells or in bacteria, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfections—Transient transfections of HUVECs and COS-7 cells were performed using CytoPure (Q-Biogene) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. GST Pull-down Assay and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Lubrol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:200 dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). When indicated, AlF4- (5 mm NaF and 50 μm AlCl3) was included. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with purified GST or GST·αSNAP (or its various mutants) immobilized on GSH-agarose beads. The sorbent was washed three times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were separated on 5–20% gradient SDS gels and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Osmonics). Membranes were probed with appropriate antibodies and developed using ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry of protein bands was performed on scanned images using NIH Image 1.63 software. Data were normalized as described in the legend to Fig. 3. For GST pull-down assays from glycerol gradient fractions, HUVEC extracts were supplemented with GST·αSNAP and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C prior to loading on top of the gradient. Gradient fractions were combined with GSH-agarose beads and processed as described above. Velocity Sedimentation Assay—Velocity sedimentation was performed essentially as described by Wilson et al. (34Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) with some modifications. HUVEC monolayers (2 days after confluence) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a buffer (0.5 ml/100-mm plate) containing 20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 1:200 dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (w/v) or 0.5% Lubrol (decaethylene glycol monododecyl ether, Sigma), solubilized by 20 passages through a 25-gauge needle, and kept on ice for 30 min with occasional agitation. Detergent insoluble material was removed by two consecutive centrifugations, at 17,000 × g for 10 min and at 100,000 × g for 1 h, in a TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The supernatant was carefully recovered, and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. Typically, 0.5 mg of protein was layered on the top of a stepwise 10–35% (w/v) glycerol gradient. After centrifugation at 40,000 rpm (SW40 rotor, Beckman Instruments) for 20 h at 4 °C, 1-ml fractions were recovered, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, dried, and dissolved in an SDS gel loading buffer. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Confocal Microscopy—HUVECs cultured on gelatin-coated coverslips were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies, using Tris-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin as a blocking buffer. siRNA Experiments—Inhibition of αSNAP expression was performed using αSNAP siRNA reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). COS-7 cells were transfected using siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). HUVECs were transfected with siRNA transfection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or CytoPure (Q-Biogene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Santa-Cruz Control siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells were harvested 24 or 48 h after transfection. Assessment of Endothelial Barrier Function—Endothelial barrier function was assessed using an electric cell substrate impedance sensor (ECIS) to measure real-time changes in electrical resistance across endothelial cell monolayers. The measurement with ECIS was performed as described (35Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 36Tiruppathi C.

Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C38-C45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, HUVECs were plated in a well containing a small gold electrode and transfected as described above. Culture medium was used as the electrolyte. The small electrode and the larger counter electrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A 1-V, 4,000-Hz AC signal was supplied through a resistance of 1 megohm to approximate a constant current of 1 μA. The voltage change between the small electrode and the larger counter electrode was continuously monitored, stored, and processed on a computer. The data are presented as the change in the resistive (in-phase) portion of the impedance normalized to its initial value at time zero. The Yeast Two-hybrid Screening Identifies αSNAP as Gα12-binding Protein—Full-length constitutively activated Gα12 (Gα12 Q229L) was used as the “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human testis cDNA library (3.5 × l06 clones). Among the positive clones (22Vaiskunaite R. Sessa W. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya S. FASEB J. 2001; 15 (A206): A206Google Scholar), one had an insert corresponding to a partial sequence of αSNAP (residues 35–262). The interaction between Gα12 and the αSNAP fragment appeared to be specific because we did not observe the transcription of LEU2 and lacZ in yeast cells transfected with Gα12 or αSNAP alone (data not shown). Gα12 Interacts with αSNAP Independently of Its Activation State—To address whether endogenous Gα12 from mammalian cells interacts with αSNAP, we employed the GST pull-down assay using GST·αSNAP fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. A protein of ∼46 kDa (i.e. expected molecular mass of endogenous Gα12) recognized by Gα12-specific antibody was pulled down from COS-7 cells and HUVECs with GST·αSNAP but not with GST alone (Fig. 1A). These results are consistent with the yeast two-hybrid screening data. Interaction of Gα12 with its functional partners may occur when it is in its activated form (e.g. interaction with p115RhoGEF (14Kozasa T. Jiang X.J. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar)) or independent of its activation state (e.g. interaction with Hsp90 (22Vaiskunaite R. Sessa W. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya S. FASEB J. 2001; 15 (A206): A206Google Scholar) or PP2A (21Zhu D. Kosik K.K. Yanamadala V. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54983-54986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). To determine whether the binding to αSNAP depends on the activation state of Gα12, we performed GST pull-down experiments in the absence or presence of AlF4, an activator of Gα subunits that promotes a conformation similar to that of the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (38Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). αSNAP was shown to bind Gα12 both in the absence and in the presence of AlF4- (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that Gα12 interacts with αSNAP independently of the activation state of Gα12. αSNAP Binds Selectively to Gα12—We next examined whether αSNAP can interact with other Gα subunits as well as with Gβγ. In these GST·αSNAP pull-down experiments, we used HA-tagged Gα12, Gα13, and Gαs, EE-tagged Gαq and Gαz, and Gβγ without tag. Although we detected some specific interaction with GST·αSNAP (as compared with GST alone) for all Gα subunits except Gαq, the relative amount of protein co-precipitated with GST·αSNAP was considerably higher in the case of Gα12 as compared with other Gα subunits tested (Fig. 1B). No binding of GST·αSNAP to Gβγ could be detected (Fig. 1C), and no Gβγ was present in the GST·αSNAP·Gα12 complex (data not shown). Thus, αSNAP selectively interacts with Gα12, whereas interactions with other Gα subunits are much weaker or not detectable. N Terminus of Gα12 Is Required for Interaction with αSNAP—To delineate the structural determinants of the specificity of αSNAP binding to Gα12, we compared the primary structures of several Gα subunits. Comparison of Gα12 with Gα13 was of particular interest because these two proteins are relatively closely related (67% amino acid identity) and have overlapping sets of binding partners (reviewed in Ref. 23Kurose H. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The most conspicuous difference between Gα12 and Gα13 is in their N-terminal regions (which are extended in comparison with the other Gα subunits (Fig. 2A)): (i) the N-terminal region of Gα12 is longer and is characterized by a considerably higher content of charged amino acid residues (eight positive and five negative charges) in comparison with that of Gα13 (one positive and three negative charges); (ii) the N-terminal region of Gα13 is more hydrophobic than that of Gα12; and (iii) Gα12 and Gα13 share virtually no sequence similarity in their N-terminal extensions. Therefore, we addressed whether the difference in the primary structures of the N termini might contribute to the differences in the ability of the two Gα subunits to interact with αSNAP. We took advantage of the chimeric proteins Gα12N/Gα13C and Gα13N/Gα12C (13Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14936-14939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2A). Strikingly, an exchange of 37 and 30 N-terminal amino acids between Gα12 and Gα13, respectively, rendered Gα13 fully competent for binding to αSNAP and abolished this ability in Gα12 (Fig. 2B). These data show that the N-terminal region of Gα12 is the major determinant of its specific interaction with αSNAP. αSNAP Mutations Interfere with Its Interaction with Gα12— Interaction of αSNAP with SNAREs, its major functional partners, has been characterized in detail, and a number of mutations are known that affect assembly and disassembly of αSNAP·SNARE complexes (39Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). αSNAP consists of a twisted sheet domain (nine N-terminal α-helices) with convex and concave surfaces and a globular bundle domain (five C-terminal α-helices) (31Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The concave surface of the twisted sheet domain interacts with SNAREs (39Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To assess whether sites for binding SNAREs and Gα12 overlap, we examined the effects of several point mutations in αSNAP known to affect its interaction with SNAREs. We also tested interaction of Gα12 with the double deletion mutant lacking N- and C-terminal regions, initially identified by yeast two-hybrid screening. We examined four αSNAP point mutants with an altered ability to bind and/or disassemble SNARE complexes (39Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). K53E (α2 helix) and K122A (α6 helix) are located on the concave face, and the K140A mutation (α7 helix) is on the convex face (39Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Tyr-200 (see Fig. 3A) is a highly conserved residue located on the edge of the globular bundle and the twisted sheet (39Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). K53E, K122A, and Y200K mutations dramatically reduce the capacity of αSNAP to bind SNARE complexes (39Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The K140A mutation enhances SNARE complex disassembly without affecting its binding (39Marz K.E. Lauer J.M. Hanson P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27000-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The K140A mutation considerably increased Gα12 binding (Fig. 3, B and C). This effect was similar in the absence or presence of AlF4- used to activate Gα12 (data not shown). However, K53E, Y200K (not shown), and K122A (Fig. 3, B and C) mutations had no significant effect on the αSNAP·Gα12 interaction. These results indicate that the ability of αSNAP to bind SNAREs does not affect its ability to bind Gα12 and suggest that the convex rather than the concave surface of αSNAP is important for its binding to Gα12. The double deletion αSNAP mutant (lacking α1 helix, α1–α2 loop, part of α13 helix, and the entire α14 helix) was found to interact with Gα12 to a greater extent than did wild type αSNAP and αSNAP (K140A) (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that the N- and/or C-terminal regions of αSNAP are negative regulator(s) of its interaction with Gα12. αSNAP and Gα12 Have Overlapping Profiles in a Velocity Sedimentation Assay—Because Gα12 is able to bind αSNAP, we analyzed the distribution of these proteins in a velocity sedimentation assay to examine whether they are found in the same fractions. Extractability of different membrane-associated proteins may vary considerably depending on the detergent used (40Schuck S. Honsho M. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). We tested two different detergents, Triton X-100 (data not shown) and Lubrol (Fig. 4). HUVECs were lysed with each of the detergents, and detergent-soluble material was cleared by sequential low speed and high speed centrifugations and loaded on the top of a 10–35% (w/v) glycerol gradient. Proteins in different fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Upon cell solubilization, Gα12 and αSNAP were detected preferentially in the insoluble fraction. The Gα12 distribution profile showed several peaks, probably reflecting its involvement in a broad range of molecular interactions. In p"

Previous studies that have incorporated covalently attached probes have demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus undergoes conformational changes upon G protein activation. To examine the conformational changes that occur at the carboxyl terminus of Gα subunits upon G protein activation in a more native system, we generated a semisynthetic Gα subunit, site-specifically labeled in its carboxyl terminus with 13C amino acids. Using expressed protein ligation, 9-mer peptides were ligated to recombinant Gαi1 subunits lacking the corresponding carboxyl-terminal residues. In a receptor-G protein reconstitution assay, the truncated Gαi1 subunit could not be activated by receptor; whereas the semisynthetic protein demonstrated functionality that was comparable with recombinant Gαi1. To study the conformation of the carboxyl terminus of the semisynthetic G protein, we applied high resolution solution NMR to Gα subunits containing 13C labels at the corresponding sites in Gαi1: Leu-348 (uniform), Gly-352 (α carbon), and Phe-354 (ring). In the GDP-bound state, the spectra of the ligated carboxyl terminus appeared similar to the spectra obtained for 13C-labeled free peptide. Upon titration with increasing concentrations of AlF4-, the 13C resonances demonstrated a marked loss of signal intensity in the semisynthetic Gα subunit but not in free peptide subjected to the same conditions. Because AlF4- complexes with GDP to stabilize an activated state of the Gα subunit, these results suggest that the Gα carboxyl terminus is highly mobile in its GDP-bound state but adopts an ordered conformation upon activation by AlF4-.

Heterotrimeric G proteins mediate signal transduction between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; EPL, expressed protein ligation; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; CBD, chitin-binding domain; Fmoc, fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; EPL, expressed protein ligation; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; CBD, chitin-binding domain; Fmoc, fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and a host of downstream intracellular effectors. The α subunit binds GDP and forms a tight complex with βγ subunits. Activated GPCRs can catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP, which leads to dissociation of Gα from the complex. The structure of the Gα subunit has been solved bound to GDP (1Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), GTPγS (2Noel J.P.

Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), and in complex with Gβγ (4Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Gα has two domains, a GTPase domain that is similar to the Ras-like GTPase proteins and an amino-terminal helical domain that is unique to the heterotrimeric G proteins. The GTPase domain consists of five helices surrounding a six-stranded β-sheet, whereas the helical domain has one long helix surrounded by five short helices. In the GTPase domain, GDP to GTP exchange results in conformational changes at three regions near the guanine nucleotide binding pocket, referred to as switch I (11 amino acids), switch II (21 amino acids), and switch III (10 amino acids) (1Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The switch regions of Gα subunits either bind to βγ subunits or to downstream effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase and phospholipases, with the specificity of the Gα interactions dictated by GTP exchange and the conformation of the switch regions. Although the crystal structures reveal the conformational changes in the switch regions and thus provide a structural basis for the specificity of interactions of the GDP-bound versus GTP-bound Gα subunits, the structures of Gα subunits and heterotrimeric G proteins provide little information regarding how receptors catalyze GTP exchange. The α subunit of transducin, Gαt, has been shown by mutational studies to contain three regions critical for rhodopsin interaction: 1) the amino-terminal 23 residues, 2) an internal sequence consisting of positions 311-329, and 3) the carboxyl-terminal eleven residues, 340-350 (reviewed in Ref. 5Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4819-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). When comparing the heterotrimeric structures versus the activated GTPγS-Gα structures, the internal sequence (311-329) does not change conformation significantly in the GDP-versus GTP-bound states, and the amino and carboxyl termini are not resolved in most of the structures. The structure of the carboxyl terminus of Gα is of particular interest, because this region confers receptor-specific interactions, and peptide analogs of the tail bind to rhodopsin and stabilize the MII activation state of the receptor. In most structures of G proteins, the carboxyl terminus is not resolved, suggesting that this region is relatively mobile. However, in three independent crystal structures, a structured carboxyl terminus is observed, although the conformations differ. In the structure of RGS 4 bound to AlF4--activated Gαi1 (6Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), the carboxyl terminus adopts an ordered continuous helix terminated by a carboxyl-terminal capping motif. Of note, this structure is consistent with transferred nuclear Overhauser effect structures of carboxyl-terminal peptides of Gαt bound to photo-activated rhodopsin (7Dratz E.A. Furstenau J.E.

Biol. 2002; 322: 441-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, the crystal structure of Gαt complexed with GTPγS shows the carboxyl-terminal residues in an extended linear structure, and in one molecule of the asymmetric unit cell, residues 343-349 are in van der Waals contact with residues 212-215 of the α2/β4 loop, which is part of the switch II region of Gα (2Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of Gαi1 bound to GDP, the carboxyl tail forms an extended α-helical structure that is cradled between the amino terminus and the body of the GTPase domain (10Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structures demonstrate disordered termini or different, and seemingly conflicting, structures of the carboxyl tail of Gα subunits, cross-linking and biophysical studies using fluorescent probes provide compelling evidence that the conformation of the carboxyl tail does change upon G protein activation (11Yang C.S.

What happens to the Gα structures at the receptor/G protein interface upon receptor activation? Several studies have implicated the carboxyl terminus to be involved in regulating receptor interaction and affecting GDP affinity (13Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C.

In addition, carboxyl-terminal peptides from several Gα subunits can both competitively inhibit G protein activation and stabilize the active conformation of G protein-coupled receptors (7Dratz E.A.

Taken together, these studies suggest that interactions between the Gα carboxyl terminus and GPCRs might play essential roles in communication between the receptor and the GDP binding pocket of the Gα subunit. Further understanding of these conformational changes should thus provide a better understanding of the mechanism of nucleotide exchange on α subunits of G proteins. To date, most biophysical studies have focused either on peptide segments of the G protein or bulky fluorophores inserted by standard molecular techniques on the receptor or G proteins. Here, we use expressed protein ligation (EPL) to incorporate 13C isotope-labeled amino acids into the carboxyl-terminal tail of Gα. EPL takes advantage of the ability of intein domains to generate thioester intermediates in recombinant proteins, which can then be ligated to peptides containing an amino-terminal cysteine residue. Inteins, the protein equivalents of introns, are found in prokaryotes, archaebacteria, and simple eukaryotes and possess the unique ability to autocatalytically splice themselves from newly translated proteins and, in the process, regenerate a native amide bond at the splice junction (22Perler F.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). By modifying the intein, a thioester intermediate can be trapped and purified for use in native chemical ligations (23Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar). For this study, we ligated a nine-amino-acid carboxyl-terminal peptide to a recombinant Gα (1-345) thioester lacking the carboxyl terminus to create the full-length Gα (1-354). We demonstrated the ability to generate a semisynthetic Gα subunit containing 13C-labeled amino acids in its carboxyl terminus that retains native Gα activity as assayed by its ability to be activated by receptors. Furthermore, we have studied the mobility of the carboxyl terminus of this semisynthetic Gα by high resolution solution NMR. The experiments show that the carboxyl terminus is highly mobile when in the inactive conformation and that binding of AlF4- restricts this motion. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were manually synthesized by fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase peptide synthesis. 13C-labeled amino acids were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) and were treated with Fmoc-(oxy)succinimide to afford the amino terminus Fmoc protection. After the final cleavage step, crude peptides were purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography using a C18 column and characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Proteins—A plasmid encoding for His6Gαi1 (pQE-6 expression vector) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Linder, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Plasmid pBN1018, which encodes His6Gαi1 containing a N342C mutation, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The plasmid pBN905, which expresses Gαi1ΔCT, truncated by nine residues at its carboxyl terminus, fused in-frame to intein-CBD cDNA from the pTXB3 expression vector (New England Biolabs) was constructed as follows. Initially, a His6Gαi1/αt chimera (Chi6, a gift from Dr. H. Bourne, UCLA; originally from Dr. H. Hamm, Vanderbilt University) was digested with PstI/BglII to generate a 3.4-kb fragment. Intein-CBD cDNA from pTXB3 was digested with PstI/SpeI and subcloned along with a BglII/SpeI oligonucleotide cassette into the pChi6 expression vector to generate pBN834. To generate pBN905, pHis6Gαi1 was digested with EcoRI/AatII and subcloned, along with an AatII/SpeI oligonucleotide cassette into pBN834, which had been digested with EcoRI/SpeI. This strategy resulted in an expression vector containing cDNA encoding Gαi1ΔCT (truncated by nine residues at the carboxyl terminus) fused in-frame with intein-CBD, without the introduction of extra amino acids. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The cells were grown in 3 liters of T7 medium (20 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, 2 ml of glycerol, and 50 ml of 1 m KH2PO4, pH 7.2, per liter) in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 25 °C up to an A600 of 0.5-0.8. The cells were then induced with 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 4-6 h. After recovery by centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1:20 of cell culture volume with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm GDP, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysis buffer for His6Gαi1 and His6Gαi1N342C also contained 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and lysis buffer for His6Gαi1ΔCT-intein-CBD contained 0.1% Triton X-100. The cell suspension was lysed by sonication, and crude cell lysate was cleared by low speed centrifugation followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. His6 purification of His6Gαi1 and His6Gαi1N342C was performed as described previously (24Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatant was adjusted to 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole with the addition of 8× binding buffer (160 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 4 m NaCl, and 160 mm imidazole). The resultant mixture was loaded onto two 5-ml metal chelating columns (Pharmacia Corporation) charged with 100 mm NiCl2 and prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 volumes of 1× binding buffer, and the bound protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of 1× binding buffer containing 80 mm imidazole (100 mm total). GDP, MgCl2, and β-mercaptoethanol were added to each fraction at a concentration of 25 μm, 2 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for protein purity, quantitated by comparison to known bovine serum albumin standards, pooled, and dialyzed overnight in dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm Nacl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm GDP, and 20% glycerol). Samples were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. The final yield of Gα subunits was 1-2 mg/liter. Protein Ligation—Purification of His6Gαi1ΔCT-intein-CBD was as follows. After cell lysis, the clarified cell lysate was applied to an affinity column containing chitin matrix that had been equilibrated with 10 column volumes of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The column was then washed with 20 column volumes of column buffer. Treatment with cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl) containing 100 mm mercaptoethanesulfonic acid overnight at 4 °C resulted in self-cleavage of the intein, releasing the Gαi1ΔCT thioester from the chitin-bound intein. Fractions were eluted with 3 column volumes of column buffer (minus Triton X-100). Collected fractions were treated as above, and the Gαi1ΔCT protein was stored at -80 °C and used as a control in functional assays. Expressed protein ligation of the synthetic peptides to GαΔCT-intein-CBD was carried out as follows. Following loading of the Gα-intein-CBD fusion protein onto the chitin matrix, cleavage was initiated by quickly flushing the column with cleavage buffer containing 1% mercaptoethanesulfonic acid. Synthetic peptides, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal tail of Gα, were dissolved into cleavage buffer and applied to the chitin column in the presence of 1% mercaptoethanesulfonic acid at an excess of 10-20-fold over protein concentration. The ligation reaction proceeded at 4 °C and was found to be complete within 24 h. The column was eluted with column buffer (minus Triton X-100). The fractions were treated as above, with the exception of an additional reduction step before dialysis. In this step, the pooled fractions were treated with 15 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 30 °C to remove peptide linked to the Gα through nonspecific disulfide interaction. The semisynthetic proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using antibodies corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal synthetic peptide and quantitated on Coomassie-stained gels using bovine serum albumin standards. Protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml using a Centricon centrifugal device (molecular weight cut off 10,000; Amicon). Ligation was estimated to be 50-70%. Quantification of Ligation Efficiency—The efficiency of ligation was estimated by quantitative immunoblotting with anti-Giα1, carboxyl-terminal (residues 345-354), and anti-Gαi-(40-54) antibodies (EMD Biosciences) and treatment with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon International), followed by incubation with Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science). Images were acquired using the ChemiDoc Gel Documentation System (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with the program Quantity One (version 4). For each set of immunoblots, known amounts of purified GαiN346C subunit (0, 210, 420, and 630 ng) served as internal standards with which serial dilutions of the ligated sample were compared. To determine the yield of the ligation reaction, the amount of protein determined by blotting with the anti-Gαi antibody (ligated plus unligated protein) was compared with the amount of protein determined using the anti-Gα carboxyl-terminal antibody (ligated protein only). Yields generally ranged from 50 to 70%. Membrane Preparation—Chinese hamster ovary membranes containing C5aR were prepared as described previously (25Sheikh S.P. Vilardarga J.P. Baranski T.J.

Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35345-35353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing C5aRs were harvested, lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and homogenized by aspirating through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. The lysed solution was first centrifuged at 960 × g for 5 min twice, followed by an additional centrifugation at 217,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C using a sucrose cushion (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 6 m urea (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 2.5 mm EGTA), incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and the membranes were pelleted at 217,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to strip the membranes of GTP-binding proteins. After a second urea wash and sedimentation, the membranes were resuspended in sucrose buffer, frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Gβγ Purification—Gβγ was purified from Sf9 insect cells as described previously (27Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The baculovirus encoding Gβ1His6-γ2 was obtained from M. Linder, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Peak fractions from the MonoQ were concentrated and exchanged into a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.7% CHAPS. The final protein concentration was estimated against the known concentrations of bovine serum albumin. Receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTPγS Exchange Assay—The receptor-catalyzed exchange of GDP for GTPγS was based on a modification of procedures by Fawzi et al. (28Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in a total assay volume of 20 μl. Urea-washed membranes containing C5aR were mixed with G protein subunits on ice in buffer to give a final concentration of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μm GDP. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 3 μm [35S]GTPγS (5000 cycles/min/pmol) and 100 nm C5a ligand, reacted at 30 °C for 10 min, and terminated by the addition of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl) followed by filtration over BA85 nitrocellulose filters. Filters were washed with the ice-cold wash buffer, dried, and radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation counting. Sample Preparation—The concentration of the protein sample was 50 μm. A total of 1 mg of semisynthetic Gα protein (13C-labeled in the carboxyl terminus) was used. The concentrations of AlF4- were 100 and 200 μm (100 μm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF) corresponding to 2 and 4 molar equivalents of AlF4-. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were collected with a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer at a 1H frequency of 700.13 MHz using a 5-mm triple resonance HCN probe. The two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC spectrum was obtained using 256 increments in the t1 dimension, and 1200 transients were collected at each increment and averaged. The recycle delay was 1.5 s. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Peptide Design—The scheme for the generation of semisynthetic Gα subunits is shown in Fig. 1. The junction between the recombinant thioester lacking the carboxyl terminus (designated Gαi1ΔCT) and the synthetic peptide was selected based on the criteria that a cysteine substitution would likely be tolerated at this position, because the EPL mechanism requires a cysteine at the splice point. An alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of Gαt (13Onrust R. Herzmark P. Chi P. Garcia P.D. Lichtarge O. Kingsley C. Bourne H.R. Science. 1997; 275: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) examined the effects of substitutions throughout the entire protein and demonstrated that an alanine point mutation at Glu-342 within the carboxyl-terminal tail was well tolerated. The Glu-342 position in Gαt corresponds to an Asn-346 residue in Gαi1; thus the N346C mutation was made, and the peptide synthesized was CNLKDCGLF (residues 346-354 of Gαi1). The remaining sequences of the carboxyl termini of Gαi1 and Gαt are identical after positions Glu-342 and Asn-346, respectively; therefore, we reasoned that previous results of mutational data of Gαt and biophysical studies of transducin peptides could be applied directly to Gαi1. For NMR studies, we selected which amino acids in the synthetic carboxyl-terminal peptide to 13C label based on the transferred nuclear Overhauser effect structure of the α-peptide (11 carboxyl-terminal residues of Gαt) bound to R* (8Kisselev O.G. Kao J. Ponder J.W. Fann Y.C. Gautam N. Marshall G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this structure, Gly-348 is critical for forming the C-cap turn observed upon photoactivation, and Leu-344 and Phe-350 are members of the hydrophobic cluster. The peptide synthesized for ligation was labeled at the corresponding sites in Gαi1: Leu-348 (U-13C), Gly-352 (2-13C), and Phe-354 (ring-13C). The 13C-LGF labels provide a total of 12 unique 13C sites to monitor structural changes in the carboxyl terminus via NMR. Preparation of Semisynthetic Gαi1—Initial experiments to optimize peptide ligation and demonstrate functionality of the recombinant Gα subunit were performed using an unlabeled synthetic peptide (CNLKDCGLF) corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of Gαi1 and recombinant Gαi1ΔCT. For the EPL methodology, Gαi1 offers the advantage of much higher yields in bacterial expression systems when compared with Gαt. A recombinant protein consisting of residues 1-345 of Gαi1 was fused to an intein-CBD. Ligation of the recombinant protein (Gαi1-(1-345)) to the synthetic peptide was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” The following control proteins were also generated: 1) the unligated Gαi1ΔCT protein, obtained by eluting the thioester form of Gαi1 from the chitin column, and 2) full-length Gαi1N346C, because ligation of synthetic peptide to the recombinant protein introduces a cysteine at the ligation junction. The ligation products were analyzed using antibodies corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal synthetic peptide (anti-Gαi1; KNNLKDCGLF). Because there was no cross-reactivity with the recombinant thioester (Fig. 2, lane 1), Western blot analysis proved to be a convenient and sensitive method for detecting and monitoring the ligation reaction (Fig. 2). Analysis of the ligation product revealed that the reaction was complete after 24 h at 4 °C (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4) and that the ligation products remained stable even after 72 h (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). The yield of the ligation reaction was estimated by quantitative Western blot analysis. In this instance, two individual Gα antibodies were used, one to the carboxyl terminus (to monitor ligation efficiency) and the second to an internal site within Gα (to quantify the total amount of Gα subunit present). Direct comparison of the total amount of Gα, including both ligated and unligated components, to the amount of detected ligated product provided an estimated ligation efficiency of 50-70% (data not shown). In other EPL studies, higher yields of protein ligation (approaching >90%) can be achieved with the use of chaotropic agents (i.e. guanidinium-hydrochloride and urea), organic solvents (i.e. Me2SO), or higher temperatures (usually 25-30 °C) (29Ayers B. Blaschke U.K. Camarero J.A. Cotton G.J. Holford M. Muir T.W. Biopolymers. 1999; 51: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, such agents result in protein denaturation, thereby requiring a strategy for refolding the semisynthetic protein when it is to be used for biological assays. Here, all procedures were carried out at conditions optimal for maintaining stability and function of the Gα subunit, which might have lowered the efficiency of chemical ligation. Semisynthetic Gαi1 Is Functional—Using membrane reconstitution assays, we characterized the ability of the semisynthetic Gαi1 subunits to be activated by GPCRs. Given the large number of studies implicating the carboxyl terminus as essential for the ability of receptors to activate G proteins, we reasoned that this would serve as the strictest test of functio"
