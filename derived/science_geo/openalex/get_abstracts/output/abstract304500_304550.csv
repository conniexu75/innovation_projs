https://openalex.org/W2095476796,"A simple technique is described here that produces aligned arrays of carbon nanotubes. The alignment method is based on cutting thin slices (50 to 200 nanometers) of a nanotube-polymer composite. With this parallel and well-separated configuration of nanotubes it should be possible to measure individual tube properties and to demonstrate applications. The results demonstrate the nature of rheology, on nanometer scales, in composite media and flow-induced anisotropy produced by the cutting process. The fact that nanotubes do not break and are straightened after the cutting process also suggests that they have excellent mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2088840611,"The selective catalytic reduction reaction of nitric oxide by ammonia over vanadia-titania catalysts is one of the methods of removing NOx pollution. In the present study, it has been possible to identify the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites in these catalysts by combining transient or steady-state in situ (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) experiments directly with on-line activity studies. The results suggest a catalytic cycle that consists of both acid and redox reactions and involves both surface V—OH (Brønsted acid sites) and V=O species. A fundamental microkinetic model is proposed, which accounts for the observed industrial kinetics performance."
https://openalex.org/W2083308932,"Liquid state structure has traditionally been characterized with the radial distribution functions between atoms. Although these functions are routinely available from x-ray diffraction and neutron scattering experiments or from computer simulations, they cannot be interpreted unambiguously to provide the spatial order in a molecular liquid. A direct approach to determining the spatial structure in the liquid state is demonstrated here. Three-dimensional maps representing the local atomic densities are presented for several water models. These spatial maps provide a picture of the short-range order in liquid water which reveals specific details of its local structure that are important in the understanding of its properties."
https://openalex.org/W1989605743,"Simulations and perturbation theory are used to study the molecular origins of friction in an ideal model system, a layer of adsorbed molecules sliding over a substrate. These calculations reproduce several surprising features of experimental results. In most cases, the frictional force on a solid monolayer has a different form from that observed between macroscopic solids. No threshold force or static friction is needed to initiate sliding; instead, the velocity is proportional to the force. As in experiments, incommensurate solid layers actually slide more readily than fluid layers. A comparison of experiment, simulation, and analytic results shows that dissipation arises from anharmonic coupling between phonon modes and substrate-induced deformations in the adsorbate."
https://openalex.org/W1967541014,"The stability of Mg(2)SiO(4), a major constituent in the Earth's mantle, has been investigated experimentally by in situ observation with synchrotron radiation. A cubic-type high-pressure apparatus equipped with sintered diamond anvils has been used over pressures of 11 to 15 gigapascals and temperatures of 800 degrees to 1600 degrees C. The phase stability of alpha-Mg(2)SiO(4) and beta-Mg(2)SiO(4) was determined by taking account of the kinetic behavior of transition. The phase boundary between alpha-Mg(2)SiO(4) and beta-Mg(2)SiO(4) is approximated by the linear expression P = (9.3 +/- 0.1) + (0.0036 +/- 0.0002)T where P is pressure in gigapascals and T is temperature in degrees Celsius."
https://openalex.org/W2041646821,"The atomic-scale dynamics of the glass-to-liquid transition are, in general, poorly understood in inorganic materials. Here, two-dimensional magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectra collected just above the glass transition of K(2)Si(4)O(9) at temperatures as high as 583 degrees C are presented. Rates of exchange for silicon among silicate species, which involves Si-O bond breaking, have been measured and are shown to be closely related in time scale to those defined by viscosity. Thus, even at viscosities as high as 10(10) pascal seconds, local bond breaking (in contrast to the cooperative motion of large clusters) is of major importance in the control of macroscopic flow and diffusion."

https://openalex.org/W2049479106,"Degenerate ground-state conjugated polymers exhibit large third-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities, including substantial two-photon absorption. With the use of a machine architecture suited to these material properties, ultrafast optical processors are possible. A four-wave mixing optical correlator was built with an air-stable, processable, degenerate ground-state conjugated polymer, poly(1,6-heptadiester). The continuously updatable processor correlates two 5000-pixel images in less than 160 femtoseconds, achieving peak processing rates of 3 × 1016 operations per second."
https://openalex.org/W2003349387,"Parallel processing has changed the way much computational physics is done. Areas such as condensed matter physics, fluid dynamics, and other fields are making use of massively parallel computers to solve immense and important problems in new ways. Simulating wave propagation is another area that has benefited through the use of parallel processing. This is graphically illustrated in this article by various numerical simulations of ultrasonic pulses propagating through solids carried out on a massively parallel computer. These computations are accompanied by visualizations of the resulting wavefield. The calculations and visualizations, together, can be completed in only seconds to several minutes and compare well with experimental data. The computations and parallel processing techniques described should be important in related fields, such as geophysics, acoustics, and mechanics."
https://openalex.org/W1971096098,Mechanical and microstructural evidence indicates that a natural and a synthetic quartzite deformed by Newtonian dislocation (Harper-Dorn) creep at temperatures higher than 1073 K and stresses lower than 300 megapascals. The observation of this creep in these materials suggests that the lower crust may flow like a Newtonian viscous fluid by a dislocation mechanism at stresses much smaller than those previously postulated.

In keeping with this year's theme of science and public policy, the meeting featured a hefty dose of applied science as well as plenty of basic research."
